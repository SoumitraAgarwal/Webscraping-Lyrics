Moneybrother,"Hello? Oh?
I see it's fine
You're somebody else's little girl now and will never be mine
But give me a minute, let me get through to you, yeah
I will continue to call you repeatedly till you do

Summer nights you know what we do
We're just keeping it tight, simple as that
When it's dark outside, holding me down for delight
And we could do it all night long
Reconsider me baby, come on!

Girl, you make a terrible, stupid mistake
Hangin' around with that guy ain't right
I'm for real, he's fake
I know that signal, that's a call on the other line
And your boyfriend would sure check that out, but IÂ´m not that kind

Summer nights you know what we do
We're just keeping it tight, simple as that
When it's dark outside, holding me down for delight
And we could do it all night long, yeah
Reconsider me baby, come on!

Summer nights you know what we do
We're just keeping it tight, simple as that
When it's dark outside, holding me down for delight
And we should do it all night long, yeah
Reconsider me baby, come on!

Summer nights you know what we do
We're just keeping it tight, simple as that
When it's dark outside, holding me down for delight
And we could do it all night long, yeah
Reconsider me baby, come on!",Reconsider Me
Moneybrother,"No, I'm not doing this to please you
Or trying to sound like something you can relate to
- Alright?
I got my friends right here beside me
- Yes, you got it what you need from us?
I need a direction, man, won't you guide me
- Sure, you need to sing this stuff

What if I do then Will I be alright?
- Oh yeah Sure
Then hold on tight
Please guide me, and my family through Stormy Weather

When I begin to get caught up in it
- Does something come to your mind
Yeah I remember who I needed to make it
- Just sing it baby you'll be fine

What if I do then will I be OK?
Oh yeah sure
Then I'll pray
Please guide me and my family through Stormy Weather

And when I'm stoned, right out of my mind
I got my friends right there to help me get my feet back on the ground

Please guide me and my family through Stormy Weather
",Stormy Weather
Moneybrother,"Am I supposed to let it go?
It's been dark and empty since I don't know
On my way downstairs I turned back, home
I didn't dare leaving the telephone

I pray the rain won't fall
Oh lord don't let it fall

Keep my brother safe from harm
I pray the wind will blow
Oh lord just let it blow
Blow him back into my arms

Your mother called me up, said your car was found
It was parked unlocked, but you weren't around
She was crying saying that there's still hope
I said, yeah for sure, but lord, I felt none

At night when there's a sound on my windowpane
I just can't go back to sleep again
Still half dreaming a tought that's you
Returning without a clue of what you put me through",Blow Him Back into My Arms
Moneybrother,"You were right about the fuss
Didn't do no good for us
Although my mistakes were few
You were right about them too
I admit that now

At at the time I couldn't tell
You were right to leave as well
'Cause the good times got less
And the bad times well, yes
That's what we got now

What's sad about pride?
It is keeping us apart
What's sad about love?
Eventually it'll break your heart

So let's hear it from the guys that tried
And let's hear it from the guys that failed
You know what I've been through
'Cause it is still haunting you

What's sad about pride?
It is keeping us apart
What's sad about love?
Eventually it'll break your heart",Eventually It'll Break Your Heart
Moneybrother,"I may not always love you girl
It´s so hard to tell 
But by the way that you looked tonight
I might as well 
Though there´s a light shining everyplace that you might go 
It is just so 
Where we might be after tonight you and me my love 
Nobody knows

Yu´ve been around before 
I know and I´m trying 
You´re not a kid any more 
Don´t rush into something this time 
It is much too soon 
Yeah, and when talking 
I´ll let her know that´s why 

I may not always love you girl
It´s so hard to tell 
But by the way that you looked tonight
I might as well 
Though there´s a light shining everyplace that you might go 
It is just so 
Where we might be after tonight you and me my love 
Nobody knows

What about her, man? 
Oh, my intention 
You´ve forgotten to
If I got the chance I´d go slowly 
That´d be the thing to do 
But still, 
Clearly, I´m pushing 
Girl I´m so sorry but I 
Got carried away by your smile 
Tonight",I May Not Always Love You
Moneybrother,"I can tell from the look in your eyes
Ain't no sleeping here tonight
I see it for sure,
You'll be walking right out on me
And if begging is all that's left to do
Here I go
I'm not ready for it, Jo

We've had our problems, sure I know
Instead of dealing with it, I just let 'em grow
But I've been changing, I showed you I could
Now, those changes ain't doing me any good
Question, could it really be too late? No
I'm not ready for it, Jo

I've had luck I know
But now for sure,
I need it bad
You see, it seems it turned it's back on me

Joanna, it ain't over, this ain't right
Think it over girl; just give it one more night
If then baby, after all
Your leaving is unavoidable
I'll think of something then, but right now, No
I'm not ready for it, Jo","I'm Not Ready for It, Jo"
Moneybrother,"No question about it, I for sure, will die alone 
There'll be no other, can't see nobody come along 
It ain't gonna work 

When asked to see me, you said: 
Baby it can't get worse 
And added
Darling, I'll be leaving if it hurts 
It ain't gonna work 

Oh, let's tell it like it is 
No way we're getting through this 

Though I wake up every morning trying to do right 
Still you drifting further away from me each night 
Though I try 
It ain't gonna work 

How I clung to that feeling how 
It might be different 
It could be fine 

And painingly this morning
It just struck me, I must've been blind 

Oh it's happening my love 
What we both have been afraid of 

Though I wake up every morning trying to do right 
Still you drifting further away from me each night 
Though I try 
It ain't gonna work  

Though I wake up every morning trying to do right 
Still you drifting further away from me each night 

But though I wake up every morning trying to do right 
Still you drifting further away from me each night

It ain't gonna work 
It ain't gonna work 
Ain't gonna work

Moneybrother,"It’s getting late and they want us to leave 
You know by the way they stare 
And girl just a word from you 
And we’ll be right out of here 

Girl you’re right, I can’t keep my hands from you 
Tonight, I know that you don’t want me to 

You could tell by the way that we talk 
We both know how this will end 
It’s true it won’t really be love 
And yeah girl, we’ll both pretend 

Girl you’re right, I can’t keep my hands from you 
Tonight, I know that you don’t want me to 

It just seems that nobody’s alone tonight 
Nobody’s lonely but me 
Everybody’ asleep in somebody’s arms 
C’mon and put yours around me 

And girl you’re completely right, I can’t keep my hands from you 
Tonight, I know that you don’t want me to",Nobody's Lonely Tonight
Moneybrother,"Sorry baby, sadly, I gave up, I know 
I was out of options with nowhere left to go 
I was much too young back then baby, just a kid 
It just seemed I stayed that way no matter what I did 

Oh let´s say it 
They´re building walls around us now 
Oh let´s say it 
They´re building walls around us now 

My friends say: 
- Hey by splitting, what did you achieve? 
For all intents and purposes, it´s easier to leave 
Now it just seems whoever else approaches me, 
There´s always an imbalacne, I mean, ideologically 


It seems that I fell out of luck into the 
Outstretched arms of fuck up, I know 
It seems that I fell out of luck into the 
Outstretched arms of fuck up, I know 

Now I seem blindfolded, I just tag a long 
When I found out that I did wrong 
Baby you were gone 
I smile and shake my head like this, what else can I do? 
I keep getting signs baby, all leading back to you 

Oh let´s say it 
They´re building walls around us now 
Oh let´s say it 
They´re building walls around us now 

It seems that I fell out of luck into the 
Outstretched arms of fuck up, I know 
It seems that I fell out of luck into the

Moneybrother,"Don't know nothing'bout any other heart
They don't know

Whatever reason we might have had back then
They don't know
'Cause they don't understand

I went through some stuff last night
""She's"" but a little girl"" is on
Still knew the words to that song
Picture us strumming along

We made it always

Come summer's heat and come the winter's dark and cold
They don't know
A thing about us at all
We get in the van and we'd be driving, and someday
They'll know our name
They don't know
To us it's all the same

Headlights poke through the damp and the fog
I got the road on
Still know the words to the song
I'll picutre us strumming along

We made always

Oh, every road that you might go, it'll lead you to a
Cross
I didn't see it at the time, but it was closing in on
Us
Who in the world would know a thing about any other
Heart?
Oh, once so tight, don't become a stranger when we part
Oh, it turned out what they did was wrong
Days where made for us when we were young

There was choice we made
If things were to turn out ok
Continuing to do the one thing we knew, it was our way
Then what they would say wouldn't count
They don't nkow what were about
Back in them wonderful days

We made it always.",Any Other Heart
Mongo Santamaría,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while

Mongo Santamaría,"Childhood part of my life, it wasn't very pretty.
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.
Listen!  my father didn't know the meaning of work,
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine.
Let me tell you about cloud nine.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
(cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free
(cloud nine)  and you're a million miles from reality.
I wanna say I love the life I live,
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.
I'm riding high
On cloud nine, you're as free as a bird in flight
(cloud nine)  there's no diff'rence between day and night
(cloud nine)  it's a world of love and harmony
(cloud nine)  you're a million miles from reality.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be

And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free

We are nothing but shadow and mist
In the mirror we look as we pass
No reflection's revealed in the glass
Don't you know that the blood in your vein is as lifeless as yesterday's rain?
It's a game where we come to conceal the confusion we feel
But as long as we're nameless our bodies are blameless
You cried when we kissedIt was nothing but shadow and mist
Two illusions who touch in a trancemaking love not by choice but by chance
To a theme that we tore from the past to a tango we swore was the last
We are shadows who dance

Stay with me, and you will see my arms will hold you, baby.
Never leave, 'cause I believe I'm in love.

Sweet love hear me callin' out your name.
I feel no shame; I'm in love.
Sweet love, don't you ever go away.
It'll always be this way.

Your heart has called me closer to you.
I will be all that you need.

I'll never go.  Wait and see, can't be wrong.
Don't you know this is where you belong?

How sweet this dream, how lovely, baby.

Mongo Santamaría,"You know, when you say your marriage vows, they're supposed to be for real. I mean
if you think back about what you really said, what it's all about, honor, loving and
obeying till death do us part and all. But it shouldn't be that way, it should it
should, it should be lies because it turns out to be lies. If you don't honor what
you said, you lie to God. The words should be changed

Ooo now as I recall, we tried a million times
Again and again and again, and that isn't all
I gave my love to you each time to make amends
Suddenly I start to realize I can't make it
Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health's sake
What to do? Make you pay, for leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in, I won't say those words again
Instead I'll say I'll try to love and protect you
With all my heart as long as you want me to baby

Ooo if I love again I'm gonna try a new way this time
Memories of the things we did; some we're proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger
Do you remember all of the fights we had?
You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me will all of your heart
You'd never take $1 million to part
I really tried, you know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried, all of those promises was nothin' but lies
I really tried, you know how I tried, we really lied, didn't we baby?
And on top of that you have scared the life, my name
But I can't understand, 'cause if you love me
How could you turn me into nothin' least
Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you?
Best I could, you were so inviting and your love was like mellow wine
Pains of love, miles of tears, after lasting for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years and break away to the blue-day sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend: I'll never be back again
But we're not really bitter babe
I promise you all the love in the world, good love in the world
But I know you'll never be satisfied just to have me by your side
Memories haunt you all the time, I will never leave, you're mine
God judged me on His side; you've said bad things and you've lied
Still I remember some of the good things baby
Of love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I'd love to get in my life
I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared babe
I'd rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was to love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight
It don't matter baby, take a lesson from them all
I never thought I'd see the day when you'd put me through what you put me 
through
You try your best, you say I gave you no rest

When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?","When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You"

Although we need each other, things have changed.
It's not the same.

Sometimes it makes me wonder.
Where would I be if you hadn't discovered,
Reaching deep inside of me?
I know there was something
That we could compare.

Well, I never meant to cause you no pain.
I just wanna go back to being the same.
And I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life.

From a portrait hung on high.
It's filled with so much color
And the laughter we left behind.

I made the choice when you couldn't decide.
I made the choice; I was wrong you were right.
Deep down inside I apologize.

Never meant to cause you no pain.

But you ran away, didn't care about me
You told so many lies
Thought you could run away from this thing called reality
But I'm long gone, I got to go on
There's someone waiting for me
To love me honestly

I gave you no reason why
Just said do your thing on the side
But now I'm gone 
Cause it will never be the same, yeah

Your were busy kicking it with your boys
Instead of taking care of your girl
But now I'm gone
I'm gone away from you, oh my boy, hey

I gave you no reason why
Just said do your thing on the side
But now I'm gone
Cause it will never be the same, naw

You were busy kicking it with your boys 
(You shoulda been taking care of your girl)
Instead of taking care of your girl
But now I'm gone 
But now I'm gone, oh now I'm gone, 
Now I'm gon' away from you

You see, the things you did to me back then, 
I'm long gon' from it now
Baby I gotta go my own way
They say (they say)
That you never (miss a good thing)
Until it's gon' (Until it's gone away)

It's Sunday night, and we're about to have a ball
The place is packed, been thinkin' bout it all day long
People are jammin' and waiting for their favorite song
With everyone in a world of their own 

Can't wait to get up on the floor
And bounce around to the sounds
Don't just sit up on the wall
Get down, baby get down

Don't stop 'til ya lose it baby

The beat is bumpin', the lights are movin' to the groove
All in the light, we roll until the night is through
Only a minute, before it puts you in the mood
And from there, it's all up to you
 
Can't wait to get up on the floor
And bounce around to the sounds

Soon as we get in he is lost with his friends
And I'm there in a trance

But he left me here at someone else's thing
So it must mean he didn't care
I'm goin' on

See you from across the room
(Like you want to know me boy)
If you want to make a move

Instead I see it 'cross the room

As the night goes on the stress makes me wonder
What is on your mind
More than a dance as you pull up to me
And it feels alright

So it must mean he didn't care

You act of fate

This time when I looked at you 

There was something new 

How could I be so blind 

We shared our secrets in the dark 

Though we were only friends 

I don't know when the feeling changed 

Within my heart

Baby  oooo fallin' in love with you 

Oooo the harder it gets 

But you don't know the love I'm feelin' 

Oooo I keep it to myself 

Baby  oooo fallin' in love with you 

Oooo I don't want to push you away 

'Cause no one makes me feel like you do 

I dream of you all through the night 

Holding you tenderly 

Right here wrapped in my arms so tight 

But when I start to tell you how I feel 

You tell me 'bout someone new who's right for you 

If you only knew my love's for real 

Baby, oooo I keep it to myself 

Baby, oooo fallin' in love with you 

The harder it gets 

But you don't know the pain I'm feelin' 

Oooo I keep it to myself 

Baby, oooo fallin' in love with you 

Oooo I don't want to push you away 

'Cause no one makes me feel like you do 

I wonder if you feel the same way I do 

Then we both could be together forever 

So why do I hide all my feelings inside? 

If I know you're the only one for me 

The deeper that it gets 

The harder that I fall 

Baby, oooo I keep it to myself 

Baby, oooo fallin' in love with you 

Oooo the harder it gets 

'Cause no one knows the pain I'm feelin' 

Oooo I keep it to myself 

Don't you ever leave me, you know baby 

Oooo I don't want to push you away 

Don't you ever go away from me, baby

The boy is mine, the boy is mine

Excuse me can I please talk to you for a minute?
Uh huh sure you know you look kinda familiar.
Yeah you do to, but I just wanted to know do you know somebody named?
Oh you know his name.
Oh yeah definitely I know his name.
Well I just want to let you that he's mine.
Huh no no he's mine!

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

Think its time we got this straight
Sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man are you insane

But see I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But your blind if you can't see
That his love is holding me

See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame

But maybe you misunderstood
'cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took (the boy is mine)

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

Must you do the things you do
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know its me not you
And if you didn't know it's cause it's true

I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is apart of my life
I know its killing you inside

You can say what you wanna say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake

When will you get the picture
Your the past I'm the future
Get away it's my time to shine
If you didn't know the boy is mine

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you

He belongs to me (he belongs to me)
The boy is mine

You can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel

What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart
He was my love right from the start

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see

I'm sorry that you

Monica,"See ya from across the room

It's Friday night and
I'm going to a party 
With my man, to dance
As soon as we get in
He is lost with his friends and 
I'm there, in a trance

I can tell that someone's looking at me
And I didn't come here by myself
But he left me here now someone else wants me
So it must mean he didn't care
I'm goin' on

[Chorus]
See ya from across the room
Like you want to know me
If you want to make a move
Meet me on the dance floor
Though I'm here with someone else
He's not what I'm looking for
Instead I've seen him 'cross the room
Meet me on the dance floor

As the night goes on
Each glance makes me wonder
What is on, your mind
More than a dance as you pull 
Up to me it feels, alright

I can tell that someone's looking at me
And I didn't come here by myself
But he left me here now someone else wants me
So it must mean he didn't care
I'm goin' on

Can't you tell that I'm missing you

I really didn't need the shopping spree
And La or Melrose, boy if you didn't know it 
Now you know, I didn't need the furs or the jewelries 
Because martial things don't mean much to me 
And ever since you been gone 
I have been holding us down on my own

I never ever cheated
I never ever lied 
So you can stop asking me asking me why
Why I never left you, and why I kept it real
And why I'm still with you 

You should've known better than to think I would leave 
You should've known better than to doubt me

Matter if you are down

You should've known your girl was gonna ride or die 
And it just don't matter if ya rich or poor

What makes you think that I would forget about you 
Think about it who comes to see ya

They say I should just leave you lone

Monica,"Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, listen

Boy, it's been a long time
Since the last time I saw you
Feels like nothin' changed
Since we've been together
I must admit that I go crazy 'bout you

And I can see it in your eyes
That there's somethin' you want to say to me
'Cause usually right now
You'd be holdin' on to me
But instead you're tellin' me

That things have changed, they're not the same
And recently you found someone that you
Decided to dedicate your whole life to
And what we had has got to be through

And baby, what hurts the most is letting go
I just want you to know that I love you so
I know things are different now
You've gone and settled down
And I thought for sure you'd always wait for me

I'll tell you what hurts the most is I should have took the chance
Boy when you came to me and offered me your hand
Silly of me, I thought, I'd always have your heart
I had the chance to have all the love, oh, how I'm missing you now

I hate that there is someone new
Comin' in and takin' my place
Doin' the things that we used to do
And makin' love to you

And oh, what am I supposed to do?
It's killin' me 'cause I want you
And you should have known my love was true
And there's no one else in this world for me but you

But things have changed, they're not the same
And recently you found someone that you
Decided to dedicate your whole life to
And what we had has got to be through

Baby, what hurts the most is letting go
I just want you to know that I love you so
I know things are different now
You've gone and settled down
I thought for sure you'd always wait for me

I'll tell you what hurts the most is I should have took the chance
Boy when you came to me and offered me your hand
Silly of me, I thought, I'd always have your heart
I had the chance to have all your love, oh, how I'm missing you now

I know that I'm the one to blame for losing you, oh yeah
I really, really wish that I could be happy for you
There's just one thing I need you to do

Don't you touch her like you used to touch me
Don't you love her like you really needed me
Don't you love her like you used to love me

Baby, what hurts the most is letting go
I just want you to know that I love you so
I know things are different now
You've gone and settled down
I thought for sure you'd always wait me

I'll tell you what hurts the most is I should have took the chance
Boy when you came to me and offered me your hand
Silly of me, I thought, I'd always have your heart
I had the chance to have all your love, oh, how I'm missing you now

What hurts the most is letting go
(It makes me feel so tired)
Just to let you know
(Just to let you know)
I love you so
(I love you so)

What hurts the most
(What hurts the most)
Is letting go
(I'm tryin' to let you go)
Just to let you know

I don't think why'all can handle this
I don't really really think why'all can handle this
Mo, I don't know if they can handle this
I don't really really think they can handle this

I'm too hood for you
I ain't trying to act too good for you
I'm just trying to tell you what's really true
Baby I don't think you can handle this
I'm too hood for you
Tell me what you know about
Riding all chromed out
Hair braided up
With the gold in ya mouth
Nothing, nothing

I don't want to pull your heart
Play you out, call you a s.o.b.
But the line you just kicked to me
It won't get you nowhere with me
I can see that you are not the kind of guy that I like
Me and you could never be
You're too nice and just too pretty and

[Chorus]

It's not your fault I'm from the hood
I love them bad and hate them good
To keep it real with you, honestly
That's the only type of fella that can handle me
I'm tired out, faded out
A playa that don't give a watch
I'm the only one he lets inside
And when he does it's ride or die

[Chorus]

I try not to let it show
Something says don't let it go,
Well let yourself be free
'Cause I can take myself out the hood but
I can't take the hood out of me
I'm gangsta, got diamonds and my peeps are so ghetto
why'all just want to please
I gotta have the heart to play the part and talk the talk to walk these streets,
I'm too hood

[Rap: Jermaine Dupri]
Call it what you like
Sometimes I like to fight
Get fly, get high
Party all night
Keep at least 5 grand in my pocket in a rubber band,
Only rock it if it's name brand you know
Prada, Gucci, Polo, whatever
The car? Gotta have that woodgrain and leather
The shoes? Gotta be 20's or better
I don't care if you're in a Benz or a Jetta
Ladies, with tattoos, about three or four
Of somebody's name you don't even see no more
You gotta have the blings, some rings on your neck
Peace bracelet, studs in your ears
Fellas with more than two BMs, that's too hood
Girls that dress like Lil' I'm, that's too hood
Can't talk without cursin' and gold teeth

I gave to you, you shared with me
For the love of you I give anything

I would chill wit you, you and your crew
Never complained 'bout the things you do
But I see it now, how it all went down
I can't take no more don't want you around

Never told me the whole truth
Never wishing that I knew the real you
How could you do this to me?
Never hurt so much, I see

Plans I made for you and me, they can't be
These are the last tears that you see from me

'Cause I ain't gonna cry no more
'Cause I'm sick of you hurting me 
I ain't gonna cry no more
Because you don't deserve me 
I ain't gonna cry no more
Pack your stuff up and leave
I ain't gonna cry no more
'Cause I'm tired of you,me,and she


And now I can't believe all the things you did
All your secret trips just to see your kids
What about the crib that I never been
'Cause that's the one that she lives in

But soon you see cause the man is not
In your love affair will soon be forgot
And you will miss me but I won't miss you
You can pull the key cause now we're through

Never told me the whole truth
Never wishing that I knew the real you
You didn't have to do what you did to me
Now you want her so now I see plans 

We made for you and me they can't be
These are the last tears that you see from me

Used to think that you and me were in love
For sure but I was wrong cause you led me on
But now I found I'm cool without you around
You gotta bounce, I'm tired

It's not the fact that it's your baby
I ain't gonna cry no more

Because you don't deserve me 
And it hurt me
I ain't gonna cry no more

Pack your stuff up and leave
'Cause you don't mean me no good
I ain't gonna cry no more

When I think of what I've done all the pain that I've brought
Baby, you should have walked out on me
And when I've turned away from you whenever there were hard times
How could you still be with me

And if it was no mistake when I hurt you that day
And went out with somebody new
But still you forgave me like it was so easy
I should have been better to you

Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not so easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through

And it's hard to believe after everything
That you're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
Thankful just bein' your girl

Never gave you my heart 'cause I never thought
You deserved any of me
I never told you how I felt when deep inside I knew that
You're really what I need

And I always gave you up whenever I saw
Something better come along
And right when I come back you're waitin' for me
And you welcome me home

Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not so easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through

And it's hard to believe after everything
You're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
Thankful just bein' your girl

And if it takes my whole life I'll make it up to you
'Cause I've been so cruel
And you've given your love to me in spite of everything
I-I don't deserve you

From this day forward I'm truly yours
But it took me a while to see
That we were meant for one another
Thank you for loving me

Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not so easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through

And it's hard to believe after everything
You're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world

You'll see it's stupid

Argue about things so critical
And you heated over nothing and just hang up the phone
I want, wanna talk in the mood
See we need a resolution like that Aaliyah song

I think your wrong, you think your right
And all that equals up to is a fight
Let's compromise before we go to bed tonight
'Cause if the fight don't die before the sun rise
We may wake up on the wrong side
Let's not go to bed mad tonight

What time is it? I'm not on a mission
To stay up with you all night
It makes me so sick to my stomach
Every time we argue and fight

I mean it girl, my head gets lite, it just ain't right
I'm fed right up, please
It's 2:15 in the morning
There is no need

Argue about things so critical
And you heated over nothing and just hang up the phone
I want, wanna talk in the mood
See we need a resolution like that Aaliyah song

I think your wrong, you think your right
And all that equals up to is a fight
Let's compromise before we go to bed tonight
'Cause if the fight don't die before the sun rise
We may wake up on the wrong side
Let's not go to bed mad tonight

I'm not trying to be mad at you
Why you make me wanna not fool with you?
Can't you see I'm tired girl?
Besides the fact it's a quarter past two
A girl like me got things to do
So let's see each others point of view

I think your wrong, you think your right
And all that equals up to is a fight
Let's compromise before we go to bed tonight
'Cause if the fight don't die before the sun rise
We may wake up on the wrong side
Let's not go to bed mad tonight

I think your wrong, you think your right
And all that equals up to is a fight
Let's compromise before we go to bed tonight
'Cause if the fight don't die before the sun rise
We may wake up on the wrong side
Let's not go to bed mad tonight

I just wanna love you baby
I place no one above you baby
You're the only one for me
Let's not argue my baby

Everything you want and need
And my baby come and take my hand
I got you baby
Let me be the man you want in your life baby
",Go to Bed Mad
Monica,"Boy it's been a long time since the last time I saw you
Feels like nothing changed since we been together
I must admit that I feel crazy about you
And I can see it in your eyes that there something you want to say to me
Cause usually right now you would be holding onto me
But instead you're telling me that things have changes they're not the same
That recently you found someone that you decided to dedicate your whole life to
And what we had has to be through

And baby what hurts the most is letting go, I just want you to know that I love so
And I know things are different now, you've gone and settled down
I thought for sure you'd always wait for me, I tell you what hurts the most
Is that should have took the chance, boy when you came to me and offered me your hand
Silly of me I thought I would always have your heart; I had the chance to have all the love Oh how I'm missing you now

I hate that there's someone new, coming in and taking my place
Doing the things we used to do and making love to you, no
What am I supposed to do, it's killing me that I want you'
And you should have known my love was true
And there no one else in this world for me but you

Things have changes they're not the same
That recently you found someone that you decided to dedicate your whole life to
And what we had has to be through

And baby what hurts the most is letting go, I just want you to know that I love so
And I know things are different now, you've gone and settled down
I thought for sure you'd always wait for me, I tell you what hurts the most
Is that should have took the chance, boy when you came to me and offered me your hand
Silly of me I thought I would always have your heart; I had the chance to have all the love Oh how I'm missing you now

I know I'm the one to blame for losing you
I really really wish that I could be happy for you
there's just one thing I need you to do
don't you touch her like you used to touch me
don't you love her like you really needed me
don't you love her like you used to love me

And baby what hurts the most is letting go, I just want you to know that I love so
And I know things are different now, you've gone and settled down
I thought for sure you'd always wait for me, I tell you what hurts the most
Is that should have took the chance, boy when you came to me and offered me your hand
Silly of me I thought I would always have your heart; I had the chance to have all the love Oh how I'm missing you now",Hurts the Most
Monica,"I can't believe you're gone
Why'd you leave
Sometimes it hurts so bad

He's the kind of guy
That runs the streets
But he treats me good
And he makes his dough illegally

That's how he's taking care of me
And I respect the fact that
He's chosen that life
But it keeps me up late at night

And I just can't spend my time
Wondering where he's at, is he okay?
I want to be by his side
But I commit a crime

I need to exclaim
I don't want to live that way

[Chorus]
I love my baby so
But he's not here no more
Hard for me to understand
So I wrote him this song
Couldn't look him in his eyes
Knew I couldn't change his mind
So I wrote this melody
And I'm singing sweet goodbye

Though he promised that he would never put me in harm's way
That's something that he can't control
'Cause the game remains the same
Now he says he wants out of here

But he's in too deep
And the only way that he will go is killing him or leaving me
So this is where I'm at and it hurts so bad
That I had to choose if I want to live, or die with you

[Chorus]

I tried to give him hope
And promised him my life
But I don't know what made him want to leave this life
And as he went away

The tears fell from my eyes
And there's no turning back
There's only goodbye

[Chorus: x2]

I love you so
I need you so
It's hard to imagine
My life here without you

I love you so
I need you so
It's hard to imagine
My life here without you

Without you
Without you",I Wrote This Song
Monica,"Come on, get out of the way
The light's green, move
I hate these gangsta singers with their music loud
Ma'am, ma'am, can you please turn your rap music down?
You just woke my baby up, dammit
Okay, I just called the cops
Don't you ever interrupt me when I'm listening to a Monica record

Yeah, straight out the slumming streets of A.T.L
I know you waited for her arrival
Through the hurricanes and tornadoes and thunderstorms
The climate has now changed and the storm is now over
I repeat, the storm is now over
Let us begin, hey yo, Monica, turn the volume up

Big chains gold teeth and yo gleam on 
All night want to be gone

Monica,"He's my man and I know it
'Cause I get a tremblin' deep in my soul
That I can't ignore and I can't control it
What a man, whoa!

He's my fortress
I'm safe from harm when everything is all wrong
May not play ball and ain't trippin' on my record deal
Still he is to me an amazing thrill

He's my man and I'm proud about it
I'm goin' shout about it 
Ain't no doubt about it

[Chorus]
That's my man
Ain't goin' let no one say nothing bad 'bout my baby
That's my man
Spent too many nights on my knees praying to Jesus
I'm his lady
That's my man
Ladies you know a good man is hard to find 
And now I got mine
You better believe it
That's my man
He's the only one for me

Slow your role
See how you goin' tell me 'bout my man when you ain't got a man of your own
See I already know
You can't stand my man really loves me

Don't cheat, or beat, or sleep around on me and cares about my needs
We fuss and fight but he knows when it's over
That every night I'm positive my man is coming home to me
He's my man and I'm proud about it

I'm goin' shout about it
Ain't no doubt about it

[Chorus]

(Ladies...)
If you're willing to do whatever
Look in his eyes and tell him I love you boy
Yeah, yeah and if he's not there at the moment

Call him and let him know I love you boy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
God smiled on me when he brought you in my life
Never want to do you wrong

Always gonna do you right
You mean more to me than anything else in the world
You'll always be my man
I'll always be your girl

[Repeat: x2]
(God smiled on me when...)

And I need you for the rest of my life
Ooo I love my man
Makes me feel so good inside
Ooo I feel so sorry for the ladies that don't have love in their life

'Cause mine loves me right 
Ooo I said that God smiled on me
He gave me something that I've never seen
Oh and I love him

Said that I love him
Oh I love him, I love him, I love him",That's My Man
Monica,"I didn't ask to go with you to Mexico
I really didn't need the shopping sprees in L.A. and Melrose
Boy if you didn't know it, well now you know
I didn't need the furs or the jewelry
Because material things they don't mean much to me
And ever since you've been gone
I've been holding us down on my own
You know

I never ever cheated
I never ever lied
So you can stop asking
Asking me why
Why I never left you
And why I've kept it real
And why I'm still with you

You should've known better than to think I would leave
You should've known better than to doubt me
It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down
Either way I'm gonna be around
You should've known that I would stay by your side
You should've known your girl was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter if you're rich or poor
Out here doing five to ten
You should've known better

What makes you think that I would forget about you
Think about it, who comes to see you
Every Saturday and Monday I was on that receiver
It's me your girl, your life, your world
My family and friends, they just don't understand
They say I should leave you alone
But I say that they should all just leave us alone
Don't you get it?

I never every cheated
I never ever lied
So you can stop asking
Asking me why
Why I never left you
And why I've kept it real
And why I'm still with you

You should've known better than to think I would leave
You should've known better than to doubt me
It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down
Either way I'm gonna be around
You should've known that I would stay by your side
You should've known your girl was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter if you're rich or poor

You should've known better

You should've known better than to think I would leave
You should've known better than to doubt me
It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down
Either way I'm gonna be around
You should've known that I would stay by your side
You should've known your girl was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter if you're rich or poor
Out here doing five to ten
You should've known better",U Should've Known Better
Monica,"If I told you
I'll be the one to make all your dreams true
If I gave you
All the things that make a man feel so good
If I need you
To come here before I give it to you
If I had to
I would change the world and make it feel love for you

[Chorus: x2]
If you do what say do
I promise we can do whateva'
You want to cause I want you
Say love me & I'm down 4 whateva'

Now that it's clear I hope you understand the way I'm feelin'
And now that you're here you can't stop thinking of what I want to hear
Now that it's true I can stop holdin' back and do what I do
And when we're through I lay in your arms and say I love you

I believe we can be
Whateva we want to no matter the dilemma
And I believe that you will see it may take forever
But we finally got together
And I believe it will be all about us cause baby I love you
And then they will see what we mean 
When we say we were together for eternity

[Chorus: x2]

Tell me what happens when you think of me
Do you think of the things I'm feeling
Cause when I see you I start trembling
My knees start shakin' just glad to be with you
Tell me your love will always be with me
Promise me you would never leave
And then take me where I want to be
Cause I need you baby, I'm needing you crazy (oh oh! I!)

Monica,"When I hear the children of today
They're questioning me the way
The way that they should live
I often wonder
Wonder what to do
To help them make it through
In a world that's gone astray

Open my heart to see
That it's up to me
Searchin' for the answers to these problems
I'm always facing things that are tryin' me
Testing all the things that I believe

Sometimes I feel so down
And no one here's around
But you, you never left me lonely
And now I see, what a true friend means
And I trust that you would always be here for me
Lord I give you all

Open my heart to see
That this lies with me
Searchin' for the answers to these problems
I'm always facing things that are tryin' me

Testing all the things that I believe

Now I'm here before you
So tell me what to do

You're trying all that I need
The things I believe
Lord, no no no no

Monica,"We gone set this shit off on the 1 and 2 and 3 
On the 1 2 3

I got a nigga me and him we be chillin'
We like to kick it he be feelin' what I'm feelin'
We got plans understand he want some children
'cause together we forever so appealin'

You'se a cute picture 
I'm finna get with ya
Put it on you
Make you wonder what hit ya 
The type of nigga making 7 figures
Every girl be after them go sugar
And he talk slicker
He pack a big kicker
The best to do it yet the way his tongue flicker
Ooh a good looker
I gotta book ya
Tell them girls to get back 'cause I already took ya

My man be doin' me right girl
(doin' me right doin' me right)
He give me what I like
We make love all night girl
My man be doin' me right girl

My baby not a playa
He's with me everywhere
And when I'm feelin' down 
He tells me baby stay up
He's always straight up and never will we break up
He'd call to say I love you that's how we'd make up
Trips to Jacob like a snow flaker
Shine so bright he make the dead wake up
Great lover know how to handle flavor
Keep my face sweaty till there's no more make up

[Chorus]

It feels so good to be so in love and have someone right by your side
Treatin' you right, doin' you right
He knows what's best for me and he'll do anything to keep me happy

Monica,"(With a dozen roses
Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
And it's true, the makings of you)

Boy, you remind me, remind me of by Gucci Shoes
Every time you walk past, all the girls be looking at you
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
And I be losing my mind ever time I get next to you

I think I'm falling in love with you
Baby, caught up in something that's moving so fast
Never been with nobody else
You and I tighter than the jeans on my ass
You remind me of this thing something like
R.Kelly singing 'bout a jeep
Boy, you're everything to me
And you're my your my property

Boy, you remind me, remind me of the ice on my ring
Boys, you remind me of this
(These are the makings of you
And it's true, these are the makings of you)

You remind me of the very first time
You remind me of the time we made love
Just like the twenty-fifth day of Christmas
Waiting for Santa Claus to show up
You got a heart of gold, baby; you should know
Baby, you remind me of so much
And, baby, you always stay on my mind
'Cause like my rims, you shine

Boy, you remind me of twenty-sixes on my ride
Completely spinning around, looking like a superstar
Boy, you remind me of how life's supposed to be
This is what you gon' buy me, and you're my property

Looking at you, looking at another, baby
I don't need another brother
Sex time around you
I feel the same my body
There's no pressure, baby
You know I keep it so real that I can't help you got the whip appeal
What's the deal?
Tell me how you feel
Could it be me?

Like the ice on my wrist, it's like kick on my hip
Mac in my lips, armor oil on my whip
Butter on my shrimp
I'm the Gladys, you the Pip
I keep my hair flipped the way you like to see me strip
Keep a money clip, you remind me of a tip
Like a pair of jeans from Ambercrombie when they rip
Like glass of wine, and every time I take a sip it's you

Boy, you remind me, remind me of by Gucci Shoes
Every time you walk past, all the girls be looking at you
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
And I be losing my mind ever time I get next to you

Monica,"Started as a little girl
Singing soul changed my world
Flipped my world upside down
I got lost and I couldn't be found
So much on my shoulders
And so much on my mind
Seems no one can help me
I think I just need some time

Sometimes I wish I could fly away
Looking for a place to getaway
Get away from all the heartache and pain
That life can bring
I really don't wanna sound
Like I can't stand my ground
But everybody need some time
That they can getaway

Sometimes I wish I was invisible
Cause then no one would know where I am
To ask me for anything
'Cause I've given so much of me
When is it time for me to receive
'Cause Monica has her needs
Who's gonna look out for me

Sometimes I wish I could fly away
Looking for a place to getaway
Get away from all the heartache and pain
That life can bring
I really don't wanna sound
Like I can't stand my ground
But everybody need some time
That they can getaway

You know I'm not superwoman
And I'm not made of steel
I try my best to handle
All I have to deal with
Not as easy as it seems
And to think this was my dream
Now for everything I have I'm grateful
But sometimes I wanna getaway

Sometimes I wish I could fly away
Looking for a place to getaway
Get away from all the heartache and pain
That life can bring
I really don't wanna sound
Like I can't stand my ground
But everybody need some time
That they can getaway

Sometimes I wish I could fly away
Looking for a place to getaway
Get away from all the heartache and pain

Monica,"Holla, new monica shit. yes. oh baby. yep

I been feeling something
You been treating me cold
You no longer want to touch me
The love has turned cold
And I don't feel special
The feeling I need to feel
In my gut I'm feeling something
Another woman, keep it real

[Chorus]
I, I had to go move on (had to go move on)
'Cause you're not worthy of my love and all we did was fight and fuss (fight and fuss)
And she would, she would call your phone
And you would act like I was wrong for cursing you all night long

Now to you if zip means nada
So don't call don't page don't follow
And you can see me in the club, don't holla
And if you see me looking good don't bother
I know you hate to see me with my baby father
On the level as me, dun dada
Your loss, but you gon have to swallow
I do bad by myself
Stop proper, stop proper

Now the last few months been different
Cause you don't seem bad with time
You say you wanna stay with me
Did you go and change your mind
You getting phone calls after midnight
It's not acceptable
It don't take a scientist for me to know
Another chick is on the low

[Chorus]

You're, so unfair (so unfair)
If you cared (if you cared)
You wouldn't play games like this
With me, so unfair (so unfair)

Monica,"Monica, Twista, Twista, you already know

It's the 17th, one week before the day you were born
I been makin' big plans just for over a month
Tryin' to make this the best birthday you ever had
Show you that you're my baby

Damn, all this strain got me feelin' somethin's wrong
Pulled up to my gate, they keep sayin', ?He's gone?
Found envelopes in between my door
Biggest day got me panickin', what the hell this letter gonna read?

Hell no, you say you don't want it no more
Hell no, you say you can't give me what I want
Hell no, how you just gonna leave
When I stayed wit you through hard times and you cheated?

Hell no, I hate to say it but I need it
Hell no, God, please talk to me
Hell no, your so called love was so deep when it told you
You should run far and not give a damn about me

How could you leave me when you see me desperately
In need of what we had before? How could you leave home
I cried so many times but never did it cross my mind
To think but let it go, how could you leave home

Didn't even ever see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road before, how could you leave home
How could you leave me, baby? Please my heart is beating
For the beat we had before, how could you leave home

Now I need you, wanna laugh, wanna stand
Wanna get just one more chance just to see you
All my friends, all my kin say, ?Mo, just let that end?
But I breath you

In the driveway, I found pictures on the ground of our first date
I never in a million years thought this would be me
I'm trapped in love with somebody that no longer thinks
I'm somebody special, look at me

Hell no, you say you don't want it no more
Hell no, you say you can't give me what I want
Hell no, how you just gonna leave
When I stayed wit you through hard times and you cheated?

Hell no, I hate to say it but I need it
Hell no, God, please talk to me
Hell no, your so called love was so deep that it told you
You should run far and not give a damn about me

How could you leave me when you see me desperately
In need of what we had before? How could you leave home?
I cried so many times but never did it cross my mind
To think but let it go, how could you leave home?

Didn't even ever see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road before, how could you leave home?
How could you leave me, baby? Please my heart is beating
For the beat we had before, how could you leave home?

Monica and Twista, y'all

I remember when you said I couldn't get none of that
Then I remember when you let me hit it from the back
I remember we was young and sprung
And steady talkin' on the phone and how we both kept runnin' back

To each other, we were always together forever to the end
I don't really know why I froze up
Plannin' for a weddin' but gettin' married, it's scary
Now I got you cryin' 'cause a nigga didn't show up
Can't really tell you why but I'm Twista from the Chi
And I'm dyin' inside 'cause I know I really want you

So for leavin' one day, I will have to give you the answer, girl
But right now, I can't tell you why I left, girl
Sweet personality and good sex, girl
Fear will take a man life, you suppose to be my wife
Goodbye, hope to see you in the next world

You was all up under me, actin' like you was so in love
I was talkin' 'bout you but thug nigga, what you runnin' for?
Cop wit you in the Benz, you the first one seen on the block wit it
Took you to the club, showed you how to 'Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It'

You was bold when you wanna get some of that
When you wanna hit the hole like a running back
Then you left, now you wanna come runnin' back
Hell no, nigga, I don't wanna hear none of that

I know you quick, betta spit that shit to so
All I ever wanna say to you is
How could you leave me when you?
How could you leave me when you?

How could you leave me when you see me desperately
In need of what we had before? How could you leave home?
I cried so many times but never did it cross my mind
To think but let it go, how could you leave home?

Didn't even ever see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road before, how could you leave home?
How could you leave me, baby? Please my heart is beating
For the beat we had before, how could you leave home?

All the women I caught you with
Still I didn't leave but I didn't forget
All those women I caught you with
Maybe I didn't leave but I didn't forget

All those women I caught you with
But I didn't leave but I didn't forget
All those women, women I caught you with
I didn't leave but I didn't forget

Monica,"My last tear just fell from my eyes
Told myself that I wasn't going to cry no more
(you did what you did, it is what it is) and that's why I walked out the door.
Moved on with my life, but not really
Spent too much time wondering how could you
(you do this to us while we we're in love) I guess I was thinking too much

I was thinking that the sex had your love
You never could get enough cause I kept it hot
I listen to you tell me your dreams
And your fears
I wiped your tears
I was there and this is why this is hurting me

Why her? Why her?
Did I get on your nerves?
Did I give you too much that you couldn't handle my love?
Why her? Why her?
Tell me what she was worth it, to make you put her first and deceive me.
You wanna come back but I gotta know (why her?)
I thought she was all that? Then why you at my door?
(Now look at you, look at us, what's all this for?
Hope you got the answers to my questions)
Why her?

This going to be the last time we say goodbye
Ain't going to be no reruns of this episode
(you did what you did, it is what it is) Maybe if you would of told me
You weren't happy, you weren't satisfied
We could of worked it out
Maybe we could of tried
(but you didn't say nothing) All of alone fakin' it in front of me. Why?

I was thinking that the sex had your love
You never could care enough but you know I cant deny
I listen to you tell me your dreams
And your fears

I was there and it hurts me

Hope you got the answers to my questions)

Now ladies, y'all know I speak from experience right?
I used to look at him and wonder why.
Why her?
Yeah know what I'm saying?
But ladies, I learn not to worry about them living a happily ever after
Because that shit just build on a lie
So it should of fall
That's why I stand tall (baby, baby, baby)
I just looked at him and said this is why you

Why her? Why her?
Did I get on your nerves?
Did I give you too much that you couldn't handle my love?
Why her? Why her?
Tell me what she was worth, to make you put her first and deceive me.
The grass looks greener on the other side
But I promise you'll be back tonight

Monica,"I apologize for what I've done
I admit that I was losing control
Didn't know that I was selling my soul
To someone who didn't care at all
Couldn't see that you were bad for me
Gave so much that it was making me weak
Now I can't believe the way that it feels
To finally be free

I've moved on
And I'm strong
I'm going back to the place
Where I know I belong
And I'm glad
That you're gone
'Cause your not what I need
I'm believing in me
I've moved on
And I'm strong
I'm going back to the place
Where I know I belong
'Cause I'm right
And you're wrong
'Cause you're not what I need
This time I'm believing in me

The love I had for you was so deep
I didn't notice there was something wrong with me
When someone asked me was there anything I need
I would cry and tell them pray for me
But now I know exactly what it is
So I'm changing up the way that I live
I'm never letting go of my dreams
And maybe you'll see

I've moved on
And I'm strong
I'm going back to the place
Where I know I belong
And I'm glad
That you're gone
'Cause your not what I need
I'm believing in me
I've moved on
And I'm strong
Going back to the place
Where I know I belong
'Cause I'm right
And you're wrong
You're not what I need
I'm finally believing in me

So I hope you can forgive me
I'm not gonna be the way that I used to be
Starting over can be so scary
But I'm gonna believe
Promise I'm not gonna let me down
And my transformation's starting right now
But I'm really glad you stuck around
'Cause you believed in me

So I've moved on
And I'm strong
I'm going back to the place
Where I know I belong
And I'm glad
That you're gone
'Cause you're not what I need
I'm believing in me
I've moved on

To think we painted--you took it from me
You showered me with a new beginning
Now I'm clean
Took me by surprise when you ran up on me
I came to life, baby, in that moment
You put your hands on my heart, baby
Now it beats

Oh, oh ooh yeah, yeah

From the very second I laid eyes on you
In the mirror in that dressing room
Seeing you with me, I finally knew the picture was complete
I used to have my share of lonely days
Beneath the make up and the darkest shades
But baby since you came I know the meaning of true love again

It's not the bags or the trips or the clothes
It's not the fans or the sold-out shows
It's the way that you see through my soul
I'm so exposed

When I look at myself in the mirror
I don't have to feel ashamed
Now it couldn't be much clearer
I'll never have to search again

When I look at myself in the mirror
I don't even recognize
The girl I'm about to glitter
Cause now I sit by my side
When I look at myself in the mirror

No, nothing's ever gonna be the same
Forget the fortune, you can keep the fame
Baby if I had to choose, you know I'd trade it every time for you
Cause this reflection that I'm staring at
Is so amazing I can't turn my back
And every time I look at you and me together, boy, I know the truth, oh

It's not the bags or the trips or the clothes, no no no
It's not the fans or the sold-out shows
It's the way that you see through my soul

And I'm so used to being whole it's hard to be half again

Tomorrow's never promised you gotta let it show

You are amazing
When my back was up against the wall
It was you that hit the restart button
Took me to a better place, show me some better ways
Now I should be living my life each and every day
Been through so much, never thought that you would exist
But ain't nobody ever made me feel like this
You are amazing

Everywhere I've been, everything I've done
All the falls in comparison to the compassion you show me
Every time that you hold me
And when I'm in your arms, I can do anything for you

Got my heart beat faster, I can barely catch my breath
Boy, you took the pain from my chest
Now I look at us, parallel to the stars
Boy, you claim my heart, you're so amazing

You are amazing, when I thought that I have seen it all
Came and shown me I ain't seen nothing
You are amazing
When my back was up against the wall

Been through so much, never thought that you would exist
But ain't nobody ever made me feel like this
You are amazing

You never left my sight
I was lost, but you found me and saved my life
I could have died, no love inside
Before you I was stone inside
But you made me feel again
Boy, I swear you are amazing

You are amazing, when I thought that I have seen it all
Came and shown me I ain't seen nothing
You are amazing
When my back was up against the wall
It was you that hit the restart button
Took me to a better place, show me some better ways
Now I should be living my life each and every day
Been through so much, never thought that you would exist

There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

all the tears your heart can hold,
But I look back after Loss of love 
and know the days were gold.

I see on fly shattered skies;
not a ray of light to find,
But I look back after Loss of love 
and sunlight blinds my mind.

Songs were sung with words as young as May,
But in the midst of summer, winter came;
A chill blew out the flame,
Now the words of haunted songs 
ring as clear as they did then.

Still I look back after Loss of Love,
and live to love again,
live to love again.

The miracle that love can do

He wonders what their life must be

Washington, D.C.

Months old
Prepare themselves for sleep and feeding

The desert moon is my witness
I've no money to come east
But I know you'll soon be here

Away from the feel and flow of life for so many years

How about you son you like you've got
Spanish blood
Do you habla inglese? Am I understood

I'm the first to admit it

To live the life I have made in song 
Well it's just that I've been losing so long 

I'll keep on moving

Reclaman desde all nuestra humedad
Mimando la esperanza que mi alma me ha dejado

Sumergidas en aguas lejanas
Recorriendo tus dunas saladas
Me liberaba al amor, alejndome de la que era yo

Mis palabras te tranquilizaban
Mis caricias tejan tu calma
Y poco a poco un reloj
Nos marcaba la hora de un nuevo adis

Estoy tan rota, qu puedo hacer?
Si en el camino sigue estando l
En mi barco slo hay sitio para dos

De soledad why mármol fué después.

Would believe

Will find

Monica Zetterlund,"Nu lyser ängarna av sommarns alla blommor
Nu surrar bin, och fåglar sjunger överallt
Nu stryker vinden genom trädens höga kronor
men i min trädgård är det visset, mörkt och kallt
Här är det risigt och förvuxet, fult och snårigt
och lika hopplöst trist och grått som i mitt bröst
Därute doftar det av sommarns alla dofter
Där är det sommar, men härinne är det høst

Jag levde lycklig här med dig och mina katter
ett liv i synd och utan omsorg att bli frälst
Försonad med min karaktär, för jag har aldrig
förmått at säga nej till någonting som helst
Och aldrig nekat mig det ena eller andra
och levat livet, tills jag krossades en dag
Det börja med att du bedrog mig med en anna
en som du sa mar mycket finare än jag

Vårt gräl tog veckor, ropen blandades med gråten
och jag blev grundligt jämförd med din fina vän
tills du bekände att han givit dig på båten
Då blev det dödstyst här i trädgården igen!
Ifrån den stunden var den mannen dubbelt hatad
Han hade lekt med dig, med oss et litet slag
Och jag, jag kände det som även jag var ratad
Jag ville slåss, och gick mot mitt livs nederlag

Jag hade hammaren beredd under kavajen
när han kom ut i sidenscarf och sa: God dag
Kom in och slå dig ner en stund, så får vi prata
Jag bare stammade, nu minns jag inte vad
Och jag blev bjuden på cognac och på cigarrer
och kunde inte få mig till att säga nej
Och när vi skildes var vi bästisar och bundis
och jag tog saker som du glömt med hem till dig

Jag går omkring i mitt Pompeji, bland ruiner
jag trampar runt i resterna utav vårt liv
Men du skall aldrig ge mig pikar om sekiner
och aldrig skall du bli en annans tidsfördriv
Nej, åt det gamla skall vi binda vackra kransar
och ta vårt liv och mina katter som de är
Och trots all kärleks brist och trasighet och fransar
Dig skall jag älska livet ut, dig har jag kär!",Trubbel
Monica Zetterlund,"I dim all the lights and I sink in my chair.
The smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air.
The walls of my room fade away in the blue,
And I'm deep in a dream of you.

The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend;
You come to my arms, may this bliss never end,
For we love anew just as we used to do
When I'm deep in a dream of you.

Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing,
We glide through a lover's refrain, you're so appealing
That I'm soon revealing my love for you over again.

My hand isn't hurt, but there's pain in my heart.

so, what's up with you this time?
Your honey took a dive and now he's playin with your mind?
Oh no, this can not be accepted
The feelings that belong to you must be protected
Hold up, time out, I shout, get it together sister
Tell him to be nice or ditch the mister

It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!

Get back on your feet please
I'm beggin you to check out all your own needs
Don't let nobody see you in a state of grievin, over the brother
there's another possibility
Which is for you to work out where you went wrong
I guarantee to you that it will not take long
For you to make your mind up if the two of you belong
You know where honey's head at, and where he's comin from
Get it out your system, don't be another victim
This took the nerve, oh boy, he really picked em, whaddya know
It's time for you to show you're not sleepin
A progress report on the two of you, you're keepin
Peekin through the peephole, to see if honey's sneakin
You estimated right, that night the other weekend
Collectively the facts should conclude the decision
You caught the brother in a terrible disposition

It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!

That's it, pack it up, be wise my sister
cause the facts keep stackin up, tell him, to kiss the you know what

But that's not, your P-are-O-be	-L-E-M
You gotta let him go and let him know this is the end
You've been kissed, dissed, listed as a dumb one
I hope he likes sad songs, he's gonna hum one
He's been a dumb dumb and that's the way it is forever
There comes a time, when you're at the end of your tether
and you know, I think you went FAR beyond that
So it was bound to backtrack
And smack you with an irksome vengeance as it attacks you
Makin sure you get the full entire view
of who's to blame, at the end, of the game
Things will never be the same

Your homeboy likes me, I like him, too, get out the picture
I get your point but I'm not rolling with the punch
I scrunched up the letter you wrote me in lunch
In 5th period I pay no notice to your motion
My work is on the table, my pen's in locomotion
Every time I turn around, you're looking at my face
I try to ignore you, the bell rings, I race out the room
Zoom to another room, sit down, what do you know?

The other brother (Who?) The one I want to talk to
Sitting three seats back, and I'm a walk over to him
And give him the letter I wrote
Because my feelings towards him are brewing, ya know?

I said ""Yo why you trying to ride me?""
Day in and day out I can't seem to get you off my back
What do you think I should do about that?
In fact it's embarrassing, what a bufoon
You even follow me in the ladies bathroom
Give me a break, I can't take it, the stakes are too high
Besides, there goes the other brother
I'm not Keith Sweat, so don't sweat me
The other brother's smooth approach is what gets me
He intruiges the Mon you know
So I suggest the course towards me you blow
You're wasting time pursuing Monie
Cause she's pursuing the lover only
And as my mother did she told me
Go for what you know, Mo, yo

That I'm no longer in the middle
I made my decision, precisely, precision is a must
For me to solve another riddle
Step into a brand new rhythm, ism schisms
Nope, I'm not with 'em, I've given
My undivided attention, you know what I'm saying?
No type of games I'm playing when

4 da children let's stick together
4 da children try-make life a little better
4 da children try to make this world a better place
4 da children 4 da children

[Verse 1]
Mothers all over the world stop look alert
A lot of things are tryna meddle with your work
From the day you give birth your time becomes a little less
You got a permanent job in which there'll be no rest
You have to keep an eye open 'cause there's far too much to contend with
Hope you got a good partner you can go round the bend with
You have to accept that to a certain extent
Your private life is at a halt yep it's a true commintment
Well the horse is through the gate get ready now 'cause here they come
What you teach your child determines what they will become
How much your child is worth to you to this there is no digit
Brothers like Ed O G said be a father can you dig it?
I write this here song to express my sentimentality
And help to encourage some to wake up to reality
Of why your parents boss you around like indeed they do
I only understand because I'm now a parent too

Chorus

[Verse 2]
What a world what a world that we live in
People try to steal your babies and drugs is what is given
To a child by a child it's the style ain't it wild
Collectively the facts ain't a lot to make you smile
But s smile does exist among the dirt and the mist
It happens when the angel in your life is kissed
And loved and hugged and cherished and cared for
When the wounds of the world are sore
Hearts are breakin' hearts are breakin' can you see it
Being strong is must and we're too busy tryna be it
Staring out into a scum-filled a world with disgust
Define the line between success and gettin' left back in the dust
Opposition that arises you know we have to get over
And listen to those not only wiser but also older
Turn our children into responsible men and ladies
And to the cops stop beatin' on our babies

Chorus (2x)

I didn't bring a child into this world for politicians
Trippin' on each other starting wars and causing friction
Makin' life a little harder for those strugglin' to cope
Bring a cease towards your fighting instead of the people's hope
It's easy for the powers that be to make decisions
Tell you to get on with get on with who gave you the permission
Sending the youth that we produce to help you score
I don't see any of your kids so fight your own wars
As to discrimination little ones don't know the meaning
Unless we separate they could be on the same team
And it's okay to teach your child all their history
Until it somehow slowly develops to bigotry
Pass up opportunities to segregate the space
Think about the children's future make this world a better place
Before decide to act wild
Remember everybody is somebody else's child

Does it mean right away that I'm wrong
All in due time, well my time is right now
So don't ask me who, where, what when or how

One that will never try to desert of defy me
So who are you to tell me how to run my family
I can plan it by myself, I need nobody planning me
'Cause yeah I might be young, but my stability's correct
Everything about my little one I must protect

So tell me what do the kids learn at school
How to pack a pistol, how to play a class fool
Then they blame the parents when the kid plays hooky
Subject to getting shot is something that I wouldn't want to be
Maybe it is safer to stay within your home
Protecting yourself from getting a bullet within your dome
It's something to think about, the word safe
I often wonder if there exists such a place
Whether on a bus, a train, or plain walkin'
You're subject to the devious ones that might be hawkin'
I'll teach my child to respect every day as a blessing
And follow the path of her future lesson by lesson

Chorus

[Verse 3]
So ask me again if I need ghetto assistance
There's food on my table and my baby's not wearing piss pants
I could teach my child more at home that you could ever
Corrupt the youthful mind I produce, that will be never
This one will learn from me, the other babies too
'Cause what you teach is censorship, I want to teach what's true
So bother me not with our by the book method
If I was already deaf I would be getting deafer
I know exactly what I'm doing, in it I believe
My life is in my offspring 'Cause I was born 2 B.R.E.E.D.

Monie Love,"Full term love (2x)

[Verse 1]
To be or not to be that is the question
Brothers be hawking sisters sometime with no intention
of tryna get serious, I mean make a commitment
Come on honey insecurity flows in by the shipment
Pardon the expression but are you already taken
I live around the way boy so don't be tryna fake
And if you want to know me better I suggest you follow
'Cause I ain't tryna start up nothing destined to be hollow
You say you understand good no need for me to wonder
want to be my man alright well here's my name and number
But if you're not sure you better stop look listen and
Learn because I'm looking for a love that will last full term

Full term love (4x)

[Verse 2]
OK we're on a date you want to take me to movies
Dinner and dancing and after that a little room please
No I'm not the one so the thought you can delete
Because it's very tracky and it's only been a week
Now you want to hit the sheets (no) don't really think so
Make it all complete (no) I don't really think so
want to be fast then before you even blink I'll be talking to another
(Where'd) you meet him at the rink oh
Speedy Gonzalez you better slow down
Because I'm levelheaded with my feet on the ground
Why don't you try and do something constructive for instance
Committing to a love that will last the full distance

Full term love (8x)

[Verse 3]
You wonder why you see me at the bus stop everyday
It's because I have a job so there's nothing no one can say
Don't try to treat me like a stepchild with ring around the collar
Or even a pest because I don't want your dollars
It's simply just a cool thing called love and understanding
A little sincerity and that's all that I'm demanding
A brother who can say ""honey your wish is my command""
And if you can't get it then I'll leave you where you're standing
I'm tryna get something that's mo' better
You see an easy around the way go sweat her
I'm telling you now without being undercover
That I might be an around the way girl
But I'm a full term lover brother

Monie Love,"Honey looking butter, word? How's he living? Greasy

[Verse 1]
I remember Rick way back in prehistoric
Wearing holey pants and always reading Marvel comics
Never used deodorant, clothes were always soiled
Instead of body lotion, Rick used the Crisco oil
Never had a hair cut, breath was always stenching
Used to try to catch me sitting on the school bench and
Speaking to me, stinking to me, killing all the flowers
Wish I had a Certs in my pocket, he could devour
Now he's out the projects, no longer a resident
Heard his father died and left him crazy dead presidents
Seen the brother yesterday, pulled up in a Beamer
Looked me up and down and said ""are you still a primadonna?""
I said no, I'll get with you if you want me
You're looking kinda buttermilk biscuit, on the money
No need for him to sweat, 'cause you got my respect
He's living kinda greasy, yep he got himself correct

[Verse 2]
Jimmy was a stick, Toothpick is what they called him
Never combed his hair, which is why his mother balled him
Used to stick up kids going home from other schools
Till somebody beat him down, flipped his butt and changed the rules
He was back around the way being someone else's Joey
Because he was bald they named him Obi Wan Kenobi
He said yo Imo be a rap star one day
They said shut your yellow teeth get me a forty okay
Well slap me upside my head, there go Jimmy
And there go all them brothers sayin' gimme gimme gimme
I see him on the box almost every other day
Ricochet from the down and out, butter up today
He made it to the top, to this there was no misdemeanor
And on Jimmy's side, you know the grass was always greener
So hop, skip and jump for the twinkle, not a deadbeat
Because he knew exactly how to rock the greasy beats

[Verse 3]
Knew a kid cursed with the kiss of being bummy
Never got any play, didn't find it very funny
He looked so scary and his head going bald
Liked to give us all his number, but nobody ever called
His name was Vom Boogie 'cause he's always throwing up
Loved to drink himself sick, never thought he'd ever stop
Used to like to wear socks all the way up to his knees
And he kept tryna talk to my girl Bonita B.
I saw Bonita B. just a few moments ago
Riding round inside a Lexus, acting like she didn't know
Who I was standing there, that's alright 'cause she's a sucker
If he wasn't living greasy she wouldn't be with the brother
Count yourself lucky that you caught when you did
I might still talk to him regardless who he's with
'Cause he looking kinda butter, and I think he could please med
Because he's living way beyond fat, he's living greasy",Greasy
Monie Love,"[Verse 1]
Who ever said that you couldn't succeed
When your heart bleeds you need on your knees and you begging please
And if it ever came your way it be a better day
And if it don't, don't give up hope and continue to pray
I know I've had my fair share of despair honey
I wouldn't give up on the mere thought of mo' money
So this is what I did I forbid
The attitude that'll get ya
suckered out of a picture
I never saw myself as some kinda hero
So listen up because your time could be near yo
Quitters never win winners never quit
If you don't believe in yourself nobody else will do it

[Verse 2]
The very young can be blinded
Thinking what they find is an easy way out
It's road that escapes the clout
Well think again because there's prices on another level
a faster route and now your foot is layin' on the pedal
When did your heart decide that you could just settle for less
Don't you know in your category you were truly blessed
I think you suffered a severe loss of self-esteem
And now it seems your whole life is a movie scene
You're still a rompa you can change if you really want to
Double back recollect when you turned the wrong corner
Don't be content until you meet your demands
You can do it blood you can be a much better man

[Verse 3]
I had some lucky circumstances but I had to work
Amidst the possibility of maybe gettin' jerked
But I'm here ain't I and I'm in the mix too
That demonstrates how much a strong heart and mind can do
So please don't become a victim of pessimism
Keep your goals to yourself nobody messing with 'em
Keep your mind straight from those who want to dictate
The spam of your intelligence they seem to underrate
It's a form of oppression that they demonstrate
And nine times out of ten they're guarded by a false plate
Never give up individual dreams
of your future state and determine your own fate

[Verse 4]
Suckas that speak on a tracky technique
Choose to preach on a sub-level spewing evil of the devil
You gotta check it disconnect it to the minimal 
Speaking tongues under drums like a subliminal
Figure that you gotta kiss before you kick
and every trick will then stick without licks you it's over dick
You didn't touch me then you don' t touch me now
Believing in the power of myself, I know how",I'm a Believer
Monie Love,"[Verse 1]
I'm glad heaven allowed me to be saved
The sidewalk to forever for me has been paved
I live a little passion every day I'm in your presence
And when I'm away I carry with me your very essence
I try to imagine a scenario without you
It doesn't happen 'cause my mind never doubts you
My admiration is in awe of your persona
Your plateau is high, everything else is much lower
How do I explain to you with lack of complication
Speaking to one who fills me up with exhilaration
I mean what I say, you know I really do
I'm just trying to say, in a word of 2
I love you

Chorus:

In a word or 2, I love you
Everything you do

[Verse 2]
Sacrifice is a word that's second nature
You give more than you take, it's hard for somebody to hate ya
Dream a little longer, I can penetrate your visions
Beauty lies within your thoughts to stay is what I'm wishin'
I love the way the world around you quivers but you float
Also how other people get frustrated but you won't
The way you relax while the world is so intense
I'm so much in love with you that sometimes it don't make sense
You please me in every way and I'll never make amendments
You are my teacher, I'll always be in attendance
I'd like to commend you for all the things I see you do
In a world or 2, I'd like to say I love you

Chorus 2:

In a word or 2, I love you
Everything you do
When I'm in your arms
There's no place I'd rather be
Stormy weather come
Oh, you go right through me

[Verse 3]
How can I even begin to thank you enough
The life I'd live if I didn't have you, it would be tough
I shudder to think of how empty my heart would feel
If you should disappear and none of this was ever real
I feel a quiet comfort when I am within your arms
You make all my stormy weather become a gentle calm
I wish to never be separated from such a bliss
The warmth of your touch, the motion of your kiss
I wish to never lose sight of the smile within your face
It's you or nothin', baby, you could never be replaced
So to let you know before I go, before I'm through
In a word or 2, I love you

Chorus 3:

In a word or 2, I love you
Baby, I really do

[Verse 1]
Don't touch the merchandise you got it honey
You're standing here see me coming you try to puff out your money
And I sure don't give a toss about the car you drive
Whether Benz 500 SL or a banger five
So let me pass without a convo 'cause I'm not into
Your rap is kickin' boomin' a system with no rhytm to it
And I'll be mighty obliged if you just step to the side
And move your sorry frontin' butt before I run right through it
You think I'm fresh, O well best you'll never get to hear
and I got money in a bank account also my dear
So I don't need you hanging round to be my sugar daddy
So you can paddy on that paddy wagon but without me and you can...

Let a woman be	 a woman

[Verse 2]
Coming through coming through make my way my tank is full
Like Sald and Pepa said my cow died I don't need ya bull
So keep your skiving and conniving kindly to yourself
Nobody asked you for a statement stick it on a shelf
'Cause Ima make it to the top to this there is no doubt
By my talent no stoppin' stones that's what it's all about
You can consider what you want 'cause I don't give a bit
A lot of things are blowin' up and you ain't part of shit
Go sing your boo boo song your life's a loser's drama
This chick is truly not with it so save it for your mama
Gettin' paid stayin' paid yep it is my way of life
I'm cuttin' through this funky rhythm as sharp as a knife
Your trashy talk is not romantic so get out my face
The litter of your loins is scattered up and down the place
So you can pucker up and kiss this here funky behind
I got to full cheeks I'll take you 2 at a time

Let a woman be	 a woman

Kickin' up a fuss cuss cuss you're full o' puss
We're the underground legionnaires you ain't part of us
All you do is complain all about the women's role
Little do you know it's climbing on the voter's poll
Babblin' babblin' babblin' babblin' but not sayin' nothin'
Bring a cease to all your speech punk and quit the bluffin'
On this groove I'll be as funky as I want to be
So step off you little Chuck D wannabe
You can pop all that junk but keep it out my face
Make a move towards me and you will be erased
Stoppin' to a brother's level no I'm not sucker
'Cause when you lay down with dogs you catch fleas motherfucker",Let a Woman B a Woman
Monie Love,"[Verse 1]
Low and behold there's a story to be told
of a sister who missed a plane
Destiny was rearranged
I never knew that I would be in this position
Makin' money makin' music makin' a complete transition
But hey in here yeasterday, today and tomorrow
forever after that because none of my shit is borrowed
Cleverly constructed my flairs abundant
Developed from hangin' with all the roughnecks back in London
Pogo swiftly gets biznizz done with no parkin'
in a mellow manner cookies on the side sparkin'
Flavour la treacherous few will do you lovely
So don't run around playin' with you like you know money
Blessed when the Lord snipped my microphone cord
And said rock it any way you can you got the whole world in your hand
I made amendments to achieve my inner passion
Makin' performances in musical fashions
Check it out hypocritical subjects playin' like
Primadonna before they knew who I was yet
It's alright 'cause my rhyme will pack a fist full
Personification, smile, metaphor list full
Blissful is the interpretation I deliver
Make you quiver, make you kidneys dance all around your liver
I'm a giver of lyrical sex to your ear drum
Come all ya faithful to the record store and get some
Soul seasones with the future of the funk
It's not hard to find I stand out from the junk
Push a punk to oblivion spin 'em 'til they're dizzy and die
I won't be at that funeral 'cause I'm busy
Don't try to injust me suicidal you must be
If you suddenly develop the urge to cuss me
A lus will be given if correct is how you livin'
And the rhymes you recite are yours, not given

[Verse 2]
Sucka A sucka be	 sucka see or you talking 'G'
Or should I say pea brain no better yet shit-for-brains
You want to save somebody save your bloddy self
It's grievous to see a waste of human tissue go to hell
Appointing yourself to be lord of the premises
When you look like death warmed up and you smell of piss
Hiss hiss hiss there a kiss of death coming
In your direction so you better start running
Doubleups of original creations
Is taking over rapidly false duplication
Artists that are supposed to be self-acclaimed
Tapping into other artists' domain
It's a bore to the brain blahblahblahblahblahblahblah
Shut the hell up I can't understand a word you're sayin'
I buy too and for what the hell I'm payin'
Check yourself before you point the finger and start slayin'
Method bottom pit used by emcee we ain't shit
Is the scraping of the barrel 'cause they're full of it
Yesterday's news tomorrow's forgotten thought
And how in the hell are you gonna pay for the shit you bought
Just like you I'm in it for self
Do whatever it takes whether you or someone else
it is amazing how the human mind works
Find somebody that you feel you can jerk
You should have never let yourself get talked into this one
Fuck around and your ass won't be a missed one
When it comes to the crunch on a lyrical basis
I pass with flying colors you might as well face this
I don't even want to go on with this nonsense
You're just a repetitionist baby no contest
War with me and you'll wish you'd never been born
I'll shut your ass up quick and put a muscle on ya",Mo' Monie
Monie Love,"[Verse 1]
Hello and hallelujah for the Wheel of Fortune
Thank God they got a selection of men they can auction
Be him black be him white
Rude, stink or polite
They got catalogue you know
Honey Dips hold tight
Form a line form a line
Behind me you know what I'm sayin'
I bin waiting since last year child I'm not playin'
Imo find myself somebody if it takes all week
Find me a piece of butt and no longer will I seek

[Verse 2]
First off I got a drug dealer
A heart stealer
Bucks hangin' out his butt
To him it was no big deal
Bought me this bought me that
Tried to spread me forget that
My name was not Country Crock
You big Spock-looking muskrat
Having money don't make you God
Find yourself a hole for you to stick your rod
No no no we can't be lovers
No no no we can't be friends
Only one thing left to do
Have to spin again

[Verse 3]
The second was a bum crumb
Nothing having mug
Personality OK but face looking like a pug
He said ""Come over to my house and watch movies""
I said who me so that you can do me
Not that I would but at least the dealer would have paid
You don't want to spend no money and you want to get laid
Back off!
Here's a dollar and the deal
Treat yourself to White Castle's
For me it's back to the wheel

[Verse 4]
The third was a white collar working in Manhattan
When he walked when he talked
When he ate there was a pattern
He tried to change the way I dressed and I talked
Showing me the difference
In the different types of forks
I said ""hey Mr. Connoiseur, you can stuff it""
You gotta love me for me or love nothin'
Take your forks and shove 'em all
Where the sun don't shine
And I'm back to spin the wheel just one more time

[Verse 5]
The final was a cop from up the block
The type that catches kids
From picking next door neighbor's locks
He liked to keep tabs
Don't you know he was a psycho
He also liked to hit
I said well now it's time that I go
I said don't touch me you might lose your nutz
I'll stick 'em in a pickle jar and wouldn't give a butt
Keep your hands to yourself if you know what I'm sayin'
There's a knife in my bag
Brother man I'm not playin' ya know

[Verse 6]
There you go there you have it
Wheel of fortune didn't work
Instead of meetin' gentlemen I met a bunch of jerks
One wid too much money the other not a cent
One too snobby and the other had no sense
I guess for Monie it's right back to the drawling board
How long will it be before I actually score
I gotta find somebody to unleash all this affection
I know what Imo do
I think I'll try the Love Connection",Wheel of Fortune

Shorty what you doing
Rolling with a real thug nigga like me
Baby, I'm from Brooklyn, but I hang out in VA a lot
Cuz down there, I here the business is hot
Mad chicks rolling small town kids with big city game
Sign up bad boy stuff we ain't never been the same
And if you want a dream would impress your luck
Cause I got more hits to bust, what the fuck?

And I ain't seen you lately
With all the lessons learned
You won't come home
And I think I can do better on my own

I'm confused 
I think that we both need to talk
Cause I feel used
Like those can-do's when it's no-more-doll
And all this time
Pretending like your love is really here
But in my mind
Your body and your soul is really there

And I can feel it in the way you're holding me
Your love's been gone for days
Is there a reason why you're hurting me
It shouldn't be that way

What's the deal baby
You haven't paid these bills
And I ain't seen you lately
With all the lessons learned
You won't come home
And I think I can do better on my own

I'm so in love and so damn blind
My heart can't see
But is it true that you've been sleeping around on me
And all the joy I've brought you 
When you gave me the pain
And I don't know if the kids even know your name

And I can feel it in the way you're holding me
Your love's been gone for days
Is there a reason why you're hurting me
It shouldn't be that way

What's the deal baby
You haven't paid these bills
And I ain't seen you lately
With all the lessons learned
You won't come home
And I think I can do better on my own

And when I need you
You wonder what to do babe
And you hurt would come over and over again
It's too bad that you can't see
I'm all you need, yeah

Oh, all you need
All you need, yes
Oh baby
You won't come home
You won't come home

Monifah,"Hmm, hmm
Nigga listen,

Today in the midst of this rocky storm,
I sit and wonder
What went wrong oh, oh
My love had no limits
And my feeling never fade away
Every thing was the same old same

[Chorus]
So don't you try to love me now
It's too late, it's too late
And don't you try to make things right
I won't wait, I can't wait

Now you made up your mind
To leave our love behind
And go on with your life, life
And now here we go again
It's too late, too late
Begging for another chance
Cause you convinced yourself
You can make it right, all right, oh no

I can't see myself giving you another chance
No, no
After that night you walked out on me
I never thought I'd love again
I never thought I'd love again

Boy it's over now
There's nothing left to say
The love that we shared
Has gone away, away
And love don't live here anymore
(It's too late, it's too late)
Cause in my heart I closed the door
And never will I let you back in, this is the end ooh

[Chorus]

You don't know how I feel right now
Don't try, don't try
It's too late, it's too late
Gotta move on, cause it's the same old song
And I got better things to do with my life
Don't try, don't try
Won't wait, can't wait
I got to plant your seed
So just go on without me, yeah",Too Late

Ciagle malo mi bylo jego slow 
Wciaz patrzyl na mnie tak jak jeszcze nikt 
Chcialam tak wiecznie trwac
Moglabym dla niego tylko zyc 

Nie ufaj choc chcesz 
Dac mu caly swiat 
Nie odda Ci nikt twych straconych lat 
Tyle tu twoich lez

Czas nie stanal w miejscu, nie bylo mi zal

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

Within their dreams, I walk the shadows

Someone who is just like me
Looking for some company

Control of me and I can't fight it
Late at night I feel the need for someone

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

Monk & Neagle,"Nowhere to live, nowhere to fall
He used to have money, but he s wasted it all.

But I pretend not to see him for the twenty-first time

He sleeps under stars, that's all he can afford
His blanket's an old coat he s had since the war
He stands on the corner of Carter and Vine
But I pretend not to see him for the twenty-first time

He may be a drifter, he's grown old and gray
But what if he s Jesus and I walk away?
I say I m the body and drink of the wine
But I pretend not to see him for the twenty-first time

She can't raise three kids on minimum wage
She's cryin  in back of the welfare line

But what if it s Jesus and I walk away?
I say I m the body and drink of the wine
But I pretend not to see her for the twenty-first time

This is a call for a change in my heart
I realize that I've not been doin  my part
When I needed a Savior, I found it in Him
He gave to me, now I'll give back to them

You gotta treat her like a lady, she'll give in to you
Lord, you can seek, you know what I mean
 
Oh, you've got to love her, tease her, but most of all you've got to please her
You've got to hold her and want her and make her feel you'll always need her
You know a woman is sentimental and so easy to upset
So make her feel that she's for real and she'll give you happiness
Woh, oh, oh, strange as it seems, you know you can't treat a woman mean
 
So my friend there you have it, the easy simple way
If you fail to do this, don't blame her if she looks my way
'Cause I'm gonna treat her like a lady;  so affectionately
I'm gonna treat her like a lady, she'll give in to me

Monks of Doom,"When your final last exit comes home to haunt you
I'm feeling like I never felt before
I've surrounded myself with loose poets and creatures
And I feel like I don't need anything more

Won't you please save me from myself
I'm not scared of anyone else
Life creates havoc
And as luck would have it
I'm tired of living in hell

When your final last exit comes home to haunt you
And your visions of excess have all gone to seed
Well I said that I love you but I spoke without thinking
'Cause decisions I make have no way of keeping

Won't you please save me from myself

Monks of Doom,"Paint a picture, let it dry
Check your thoughts and speak now of us
Look how you worry, pacing all around the place
Feel now the intuition in the air
[dreaming] thoughts, they move us so well

It is a penny for your thoughts my boy
Tell me all that you know
You curious colorful creature, won't you show

From day to day
When you live and you wake
The ... of tawdry ...

Like a fatal mistake
Indecision is a razor
All in good time we throw our options out the window
All in good time we go driving off the road

Pain and fury, tension ...
Balance, glory, triumph and pain
... the poetry of memory
You know that everything we had was real
Drifting away and still gaining speed

It is a quarter for your dream old man
Knowing all that you know
... the place the world has left you
Fighting for your hopes that fade away",All in Good Time
Monks of Doom,"Swell surging forwards

A test of your hands

From the Irish Sea
The Lusitanian

Memories come back to you
From faces on walls
The faces of friends
That might have lied to us all 

Visions of yesterday
Go back through the years
Back to creation
With the exception of fear

Down on this beach
From the cold North sea
The ghosts of ... land
Sing out to me

Down on this beach
From the Baltic Sea
We will dance on islands
Like we are diseased

Down on the sand will come a thought that will mark
A place in your conscience, a scratch in your heart

Your transcendence expected, so be reassured",The Beach of Deception
Monks of Doom,"Laughter on his breath
The smell of fish clandestine hits
The thief he will aspire
To take the piece that he desires

Contempt for the rest
Know his past and second guess
Still it's on his shirt
The telltale signs with which he flirts

And it's on the radio today
Ringing in your ears it's in the way

He won't be coming out today
From the void into the fray
From a broken egg the storm is born today 

Eyes blind with rage
The deep caress of hell to pay 

She is all the world to all of me
She is fascination clandestine

She is burning now
Brilliant flames from off the bow
He is on the deck
Sailing towards untouched points west

She will return
Deep within our veins
We'll add it to our tab and wash away 

She is now omnipotent to me
Everywhere in all I think and see
And it's on the radio today
Ringing in your ears it's in the way

I wonder what she'd say
But her face is just a memory
And she hasn't got the New York Times to read
If May could see today

If May could speak today
I know just what she's say
To lots of folks you may be a saint
But a death threat still makes you feel faint

If May could speak today
But the worms just eat away

Monks of Doom,"Lost in a paperback rain
Picking through books that you won't read again
Keeping your promises vague
Lost in the crowd in the circus parade

Keeping your Polaroids dry
Delirious fevers burn night after night
The cryptic malaise that you're in
The art that may come of it I'd recommend

To focus attention on books you might write
Ripped off from diaries, kept out of sight
The evidence you hide

Keeping your bed warm at night
It's not an illusion it glows very bright
With the young coal the fire is fed
Who you keep with you is best left unsaid

On finding particular friends
Remember that all moral fiber will bend
To put them in letters you burn as you write
Seen in reflections and not with your eyes
Cultivating lies",The Evidence You Hide
Monks of Doom,"I was cross-eyed, stoned and painless
My pulse was up my eyes were red
My visions, situations, feelings
Hung on my lips and burned me up
And 18 hours spent asleep
Could not help me from thinking that
I had somehow managed to fool myself
I had missed the point while puttin' 'em back 

I can't help from thinking
As my heart keeps beating
Of what I'd love to do
To strip the flesh that hides these bones
Bare my soul without a sound
Burn my brain, lay waste to fear
Though I won't live that many years
And I can't shed that many tears

Claustrophobic, paranoid
Laughing at my routine cares
The charade of my brilliant life
Had drawn a crowd these last few years
As I entertain my audience,
The stage was torn by all I knew
Who took me to the moon above
Wrapped my soul in linen cloth 

I can't help from thinking
As my heart keeps beating
If I was Jesus Christ
And all the things I'd love to know
Why I feel the way I do,
And what it means to be alive
And make yourself a sacrifice
To never have to live a lie 

You take yourself so seriously
You're dressed in black but your soul is green
You've got an understanding of the world
That's only based on what you've seen 
And if you'd just admit to yourself
That it's not such an awful place
The grim facade that hides your mind
May yet reveal a smiling face 

I can't help from thinking
As my heart keeps beating
Of what I'd love to do
Locked away just me and you
If you can only see me through
And see what we could make it to
Forget the things that need no proof
And see the world with eyes of fools",Taste of Tendon

Wandering aimlessly, wavering endlessly

I struggle to reach

Is there any hope that she is still alive?
Why haven't they found her?
It's rather ghastly to think the little child was not yet five

What has become of Millicent Frastley?
Last seen alone playing at the edge of the park
There was no one with her to keep her from straying away
And she wandered off into the oncoming dark

To where she sat nibbling grass
And an arm with two elbows then held out a tin filled with cinnamon balls
And beckoned the youngster in

Things which so seldom turn out for the best

Which a heavy tea only increased
Though they felt it was scarcely genteel to mention the loss of the child

Police with their truncheons and notebooks descended
On the haunts of the underworld
In spite of their efforts, they ended with nothing
They could not find the girl

Arrived at a gate in an endless wall
It pulled up the drive and stopped on the gravel
At the foot of a vast and crumbling hall

And hope started to languish
It soon was replaced by all manner of fear
The family twisted their fingers in anguish
And got them all damp with the flow of their tears

The child was removed to a ballroom whose hangings
And mirrors were streaked with a luminous slime
They leapt through the air with their buzzings and twangings
To work themselves up to their ritual crime

They stung her and stripped off her garments and lastly
They sucked inside a kind of a pod

Was sacrificed to the insect god

Lost direction

Mono Puff,"A remote broadcast tower outside New York City sends its message into the area. Tonight they play a recorded performance of the group Mono Puff. Beyond the Orange Mountains west of the city, this night clouds settle and the sun's rays can no longer hold back the interference from the distant antennas. Against nature, a family labours to isolate the sound of Mono Puff from the static. Like so many others before them, they strain at the fine tuning knob of their receiver. Finally free, they hear and understand. This recording is dedicated to their struggle.",Distant Antenna

Didn't whisper sweet nothings. Never told me I'm pretty.
You sure weren't perfect. What's perfect these days?
But you left me now I'm destroyed.

You cheated at cards, and lied when you hung out
In bars making time with those girls you called old pals
I cried when you left me,
Now I'm wondering when you'll make it all up to me?

Don't I have the right to be over you yet?
I've tried pretending. I tried to forget.
Though it's past three AM I would still let you in
'Cause I can't go on dreaming alone.

I work at my desk and stare at the letter
And think of the first one that you never answered.
Pour milk in my coffee and watch it explode
And know that you're doing the same.

Don't I have the right to be over this fling?

I would try someone new if that someone would love me the way you did.

You could count on me with just one hand.
When I digress you'll find me smiling.

And die a thousand times

And hope is fading out
And all the love is gone

There are times when you feel
That you don't know where you fit in
So, you hide what is real
Even when it hurts to pretend
To be the one that you think
Everybody wants you to be
No one sees

The one you really are
But you don't have to hide your heart
'Cause nothing needs to change
Sometimes it might seem hard
And your whole world falls apart
Just know that you when you feel that way

Even heaven cries, everybody cries
It's okay to doubt yourself sometimes
You don't have to be afraid of what you feel inside
It's alright 'cause even heaven cries

When you look in the mirror
And you don't see picture perfect
What they say breaks your heart
And makes you feel that you're not worth it
What if this fear hides in tears
Still play and make believe
So no one sees

The one you really are
But you don't have to hide your heart
'Cause nothing needs to end every way
Sometimes it might seem hard
Your whole world falls apart
Just know that you when you hear the rain

Even heaven cries everybody cries
It's okay to doubt yourself sometimes
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you feel inside
It's alright, it's alright

No you're not alone don't be ashamed

You're special, who you are
In time you're gonna see, you're gonna see

Monrose,"Our final conversation
It lies heavy on my mind
And although we couldn't say it
I think we know we can't go back this time
Your love and desperation
Is the writing on the wall
And will all the light start flashing?
Or is this the final curtain call?

It's such a shame, it's such a shame (ah)
Don't walk away, don't walk away (ah)
All this time I thought I knew myself
But once again I bury my head in shame

Nothing lasts forever
A flower always dies
I never felt the beauty
Why can't I see through other people's eyes?

It's such a shame, it's such a shame (ah)
Don't walk away, don't walk away (ah)
All this time I thought I knew myself
But once again I bury my head in shame

I paid the price for all mistakes (ah)
And when love ends new life begins (ah)
My independence always nails me to the floor
And it leaves me wanting more
It leaves me wanting more

I've got everything
A girl could ever need
So why do I still feel
Like my life's so incomplete
You made me beautiful
You brought me to my knees
So please don't go
Don't take the missing piece

It's such a shame, it's such a shame (ah)
Don't walk away, don't walk away (ah)
All this time I thought I knew myself
But once again I bury my head in shame

It's such a shame, it's such a shame (ah)
Don't walk away, don't walk away (no, oh) (ah)

Monrose,"Here I am once again
Staring at an empty chair
Kidding myself you're there
You can't live in the past
It'll only make you mad
Everybody It'll take all you have

When your heart is like a shadow
Of someone you used to know
And it's time to let it go

Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody gets it wrong sometimes
Tomorrow is another day
You won't feel the same inside
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody gets it wrong sometimes
And you don't have to have the reason why
Everybody makes mistakes

Why do I make hard
Harder than I needs to be
Nothing ever seems easy
There is no point looking down
Everybody scared of heights
But really fear is just a state of mind

If your hearts like a shadow
Of someone you used to know
Maybe try and let it go

Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody gets it wrong sometimes
Tomorrow is another day
You won't feel the same inside
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody gets it wrong sometimes
And you don't have to have the reason why
Everybody makes mistakes

No one can be what you need all the time
It just don't happen like
Things that we say
Games that we play
They can tear us all apart

I give my heart

Tomorrow is another day
You won't feel the same inside

When there's nothing but gray clouds in the sky

Though hearts can get broken
If it's only for a minute you hold them
Some moments are golden

Doesn't matter how long it's gonna take
How many mountains I must climb
Not counting the wrong turns that I take
I'm gonna get there some how some time

Monrose,"When we first met you said it's complicated take it slow
Deeper then water goes the more you wanna dip your toe
I couldn't get enough I wanted you right there and then
Ignoring all the signs I thought that you and I were cool
Said I was beautiful you put me on a pedestal
I would do anything to get back to those days again

Don't know what's wrong
Want to stay
In your arms

If two people can have it all
Live the dream and break the rules
Tell me, why not us?
If to people can fall in love
Destiny should be enough
So tell me, why not us?

If this ain't right what are we fighting for?
Like two worlds at war
What the heart beats for is love
Turns anything to dust, oh

We're out for dinner and I notice you don't look my way
Remember when you used to hang on every word I say
And compliment me on a dress I would choose to wear

I got my face in the furnace, I got my snake in a sleeve

Roll up your expectations, and feed them into my sleep
I'll ask the master cylinder what kind of cookies he eats
And I'm never gonna tell you why

Like a dream of diesel heart that just won't go

Keep our shrieking little urges in our burned out little heads

Make sure you get this now

My friend said he needed someone
Not searching for just anyone
I recommend the name of christ
He said he didn't need him in his life
But mother's sickness, daddy's lung disease
Financial burden found him on his knees
He searched his heart and realized
Although i'm down, my soul can rise

Am i lost in sin? (i'll say yes)
Is there anyway that i can be saved? (i'll say yes)
If i run to you, will you, will you hear my cry? (i'll say yes)
Will you dry all these tears from my eyes? (i'll say yes)
So many questions, lord

All of my life, i say yes
But i'm ready
And i'm willing
To go all the way
Yeah, say yes

You're spinning around on a ferris wheel
Trying to find what's really real
Now old confucius is wise, i'm told
But him and buddha can't save your soul
Ol' elijah didn't die for you
It's time for someone to tell the truth
When critics say, it don't make sense
I'm the living evidence

When it feels like i can't go on
I'll just say (i'll say yes)
When the world say no
You'll still hear montell, when he says (i'll say yes)
When i'm talked about, and lied on, and criticized
(i'll say yes)
Even then, he'll make everything alright (i'll say yes)
I want to testify

All of my life, i'll say
Through the storming rain
You know i'll say yes
Heartache and pain
You know i'll say yes
Everyday
You know i'll say yes
All over the building
Everybody, stand up on your feet
And say

All of my life, i'm gonna say yes

Would you swing from a chandelier?

You didn't even call me back 
Now tell me, baby, what up wit that? 

Now you told me you need 
A man like me from the streets 
Remember when I was tossin'

Montell Jordan,"Oh yeah, coming right back at cha,
With a different type of swing
You know, you better ask somebody 
Baby, this is for you, and you, and definitely you

I'm the type of guy who takes time to just kick back
I turn around my baseball cap
I have a 40 sitting on my lap
Slamming the ivories until I sees
A female worth my while
I'm scoping it, checking a smile 
And I know that I can get it
And I'll hit it if she's with it 
I get the 5 to the 6-7 digits
Call her up on my cellular 
And all the shit that I'll say to her
The fun will begin when I hit the skizins
So if a girlie is lonesome
I think that she knows where to go when she wants some
'Cause Monty ain't here for nothing but I gotta let all

I call up my crew I tell them bring a brew
And some Hennessey for the beach party
So call up your girlfriends
And you know there always tends to be an ugly one
But bring her, too
Fat or skinny she likes to shoop

Don't you worry, you be strong, help you get along
Everything is gonna be alright, find someone who would treat you right
He don't deserve a woman like you, woman you are

You never knew that goodbye could hurt so much
Till the morning he told you he was going away
He lied to you, mistreated you, he even raised his hand to you
You weathered the storm, but ended up in the rain

It's driving you crazy, you're wondering maybe
Think it's something you did wrong
You carried his baby, but now, now, now, lady
Can't you see that you're so strong?

You were so strong
The sun's gonna shine again, it won't be long

Everything is gonna be alright, broken hearts are a part of life
This is something that you must go through
Everything is gonna be alright, find someone who would treat you right
Very sorry that he hurt you

Oh, the time has come to place all your fears aside
You owe it to yourself to give love another try
With someone who'll care for you, true to you
Make dreams realities for you, the rain is over
Just dry all the tears from your eyes

It's driving me crazy, I'm telling you, baby
You ain't done nothing wrong
Take care of your baby, but na, na, na, lady
Can't you see that you're so strong?

Everything is gonna be alright, broken hearts are a part of life
This is something that you must go through

He's right there
As close as the breath you just drew
As close as the fingers on the end of your hand
God is right there
He's everywhere
But you know, He only comes where He's invited
And when you need His help
All you've got to do is open your mouth and call out to Him
Just tell him yes
It's that easy, it's that simple
All of the work for Him to come into your life has already been done
All you've got to do is just tell Him ""Yes""",I Say Yes (Interlude)
Montell Jordan,"Never alone
Use your heart as a telephone
Never alone
You know Montell won't do you wrong

I asked your woman, why she's crying
She told me she was lonely
She thought you were perfect guy
But you could never love her only

Don't get me wrong, I'm not the one
Breaking up a happy home
It's the lonely man who understands
She don't wanna be alone

Never alone
Use your heart as a telephone
Never alone
You know Montell won't do you wrong

So I ask her if you treat her right
She don't deny that your love is tight
But sometimes she only needs a friend
When she calls on me, quarter after three
Holding pillows to the phone [Incomprehensible]
It's her lonely heart that you're tearing apart
You don't even have a clue

You don't have to be alone, baby
Anytime you cry, day or night
You'll never be alone
Use your heart as a telephone, baby
It's not too late, 'cause this must die
Before you run to me

Never alone
Use your heart as a telephone
Never alone
You know Montell won't do you wrong

You don't have to be alone, baby
Anytime you cry, day or night
You'll never be alone
Use your heart as a telephone, baby
It's not too late, 'cause this must die
Before you run to me

Never alone
Use your heart as a telephone
Never alone
You know Montell won't do you wrong

The woman's lonely
She's reaching out
Needs to talk to
Someone who's willing to listen
Is it you? Will you be there?
I know she was my woman

Over a rendezvous
I'll be there in an hour still wet from the shower

Trying to prove I had game
I didn't say I had a woman at home

We agreed we will call each other

Now I'm thinking unfaithfully
'cause you voice is killing me, so

Of your voice on my telephone
Realizing you're breaking me down
Now we're saying that we both gotta have it
But getting caught is a really bad habit
And I don't want to get accustomed to
This feeling of lust for you

Whispering softly (in my ear)
That she wants me (she wants my body)
More than I've ever known (wants to pull me near)
I'll just tell her (that I gotta let her go)
That it's over (gotta go, gotta go)
Though I want her (she gotta go)
She must go, don't you call me no more

God is speaking to someone
Right now
I don't know where you are, who you are
God has a message for you
You see, oh, thank you lord

See, whatever it is
That you've been searching for
Searching and looking
Looking all over
You're searching and you're trying to find it
You don't know what it is, God is gonna show you
He's gonna show you right there
What you're looking for
And all you have to do is say yes
Help me

I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes

I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes

I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes

All of my life, I'll say
(shhhh!)
Make sure you get this now

My friend said he needed someone
Not searching for just anyone
I recommend the name of christ
He said he didn't need him in his life
But mother's sickness, daddy's lung disease
Financial burden found him on his knees
He searched his heart and realized
Although I'm down, my soul can rise

Am I lost in sin? (I'll say yes)
Is there anyway that I can be saved? (I'll say yes)
If I run to you, will you, will you hear my cry? (I'll say yes)
Will you dry all these tears from my eyes? (I'll say yes)
So many questions, lord

All of my life, I say yes

But I'm ready
And I'm willing
To go all the way
Yeah, say yes

You're spinning around on a ferris wheel
Trying to find what's really real
Now old confucius is wise, I'm told
But him and buddha can't save your soul
Ol' elijah didn't die for you
It's time for someone to tell the truth
When critics say, it don't make sense
I'm the living evidence

When it feels like I can't go on
I'll just say (I'll say yes)
When the world say no
You'll still hear montell, when he says (I'll say yes)
When I'm talked about, and lied on, and criticized
(I'll say yes)
Even then, he'll make everything alright (I'll say yes)
I wanna testify

All of my life, I'll say
Through the storming rain
You know I'll say yes
Heartache and pain
You know I'll say yes
Everyday
You know I'll say yes
All over the building
Everybody, stand up on your feet
And say

Girl I wanna ride it (let's get rowdy)

Now baby was more than incredible, she did her thing
5'5"" 146, wearing nothing but a G-string
Her chocolate lips and, sexy thighs, sittin' properly up on top of me
She's ridin', and never ain't no stoppin' me now
She bounced back, then rocked slow
Like she's auditioning to kick it in my video
There ain't No Limit, to what she'd do
I'm listening, she's whispering
Her girl wanna ride me too

Let's ride (let's get rowdy)
Yes she do
All night (let's get rowdy)

Moving up and down, and around and around
She's moving up and down, and round and round, let's ride
Oh baby ain't nothin' like the real thing, can't you see

See us Soldiers do it wild, I could make you smile
Make my nine go pow, put on your boots let's run some miles
Camouflage on them sheets, make that headboard squeak
Up and down til you weak, cause us thugs like to freak
68'll be my code, if you Bout It girl let's roll
I told you was No Limit cause tonight, anything goes

Anything goes, let's roll, lemme help you take up off your clothes
Give me a preview before, and the rest after the show
Thug love mixed with cream, Hennessy, strawberries, and Moet
Champagne, mo' in bath hop in the hot tub, drop a foot off a Oriental Rug
Can't get enough, you on top of me, me on top of you
Do what you want to this thug, girl ain't no stoppin' you

Montell Jordan,"Two lonely hearts in search of love
Meet finally face to face
The happiness and joy I'd lost
I found in your embrace
A taste of heaven is in your kiss
I lie you down and then
I memorize what I'm feeling now
Don't want this night to end (It was the)

Longest night of my life
We made love until the morning light
(It was the)
Longest night of my life
Why did we ever
Have to say goodnight
I never wanna say goodnight

{Spoken}
Yeah, I wish this night could go on forever
And if I can do anything to make that happen
I promise you
I'll do it

Oh, I'm lying awake and I'm dreaming about
The vows I'll make to you
Tomorrow our father, our family, our friends
Will hear us say ""I do""
This moment in time dances all through my mind
Our sacred wedding day
I never knew eleven hours could seem
A million miles away (It was the)

Longest night of my life
Praying tomorrow you'd be my wife (It was the)
Longest night of my life
Praying we'd never have to say goodbye
I never wanna say goodbye

{Spoken}
These are the first days of the rest of my life
Lets do our best
To raise a family
To love each other
To have and hold
In sickness and health
Till death do us part
Baby, we gotta work on this
We don't ever have to say goodbye
We'll just love each other

I never will forget the look
You had upon your face
No tears to cry, no long goodbyes
You want to leave this place
So now my nights are sleepless
No apologies to say
I'm trying to be strong
I'm trying to hold on 
And face another day (After the)

Longest night of my life
Why did you ever say goodbye
I was in love with you
Did what you want me to do, oh
(It was the)
Longest night of my life
And the tears fall from my eyes ",The Longest Night
Montell Jordan,"Huh, yeah
I wanna tell you about this lady
She's so special to me
I want you all to know about her
Know what I'm saying? 
Yo, check this out

I got a new lady in my life
And it hurts so much to say goodbye
Every time I'm on the road
In my hotel room alone
I stare at your picture, I miss you
I wanna come home

I miss you so
Counting the tears on my pillow
Nobody knows quite like I know
How I'm missing you
And when those teardrops fall like rain
I don't wanna feel like this again
You hear what I'm saying? 
Sydney, I'm missing you

Da-da's home
I'm gonna sweep you off your feet
Hold you in my arms and sing you to sleep
When you're crying
I am going to dry your weeping eyes
Rock you in the midnight hour
Tonight I realize

Let me hear you say
Da-da, da-da
The first words you said are ringing in my head again
Da-da, da-da, oh da-da
Everytime I go away, I'm missing you
Everyday
",Missing You
Montell Jordan,"[Chorus]
How can I fill this empty space when
Suddenly you're gone?
And where can I find the strength
Each day I
Need to carry on?
Oh, tell me when will I smile again
Will I ever make it through
Wishing that I had one last chance
To say I love you 

Baby I know I was crazy
'cause I found out that lately
My life hasn't been much fun
Living all alone-please save me
Will you tell me what must I do
To bring you
Back into my arms where you belong
Loving me yesh, or is it too late?

[Chorus]

Oh, darling catch me 'cause I'm falling
At night your name I'm calling 
It echoes off the wall, 'cause you're not here at all
You're leaving left me
Without the arms that kept me
Now finally
All the things I never got to say
Fade away and oh

I fall down on my knees at night
Asking God to make it right
But now it's too late (It's much too late)
I made a big mistake (I was wrong, I was wrong)
So now you're loving someone new
And I'm the fool you're toasting to
If I could play God for a minute
Then my life, you'd be right back here in it

[Chorus: x 2]",One Last Chance

Just let you leave without a trace

Girl we shared the laughter and the pain 
We even shared the tears 
You're the only one who really knew me at all

There is just an empty space 
There's nothing left here to remind me 
Just a memory of your face 

Take a look at me now 
There is just an empty space 
And you're coming back to me is against the odds 
That's a chance I've gotta take 

I wish I could just make you turn around 
Turn around and see me cry 
There's so much I need to say to you 
So many reasons why

I've been thinking about our love

Maybe 
We could spend a little time  because

The moments that we share have been so

Won't you come home

Since you been gone 
Won't you come home

That you need a change of pace, and so 
I said 
We both could use a little space 
Never thinking... 
A little while would be forever without your love 
Without your love 

I can't imagine life 
I can't imagine love

When I'm not there

Letting you know I'm coming

Tell me  do you 
Do you play the music low 
And burn your candles 
Do you touch yourself 
Pretending that you're me 
Do you think of me 
With toys and things inside you 
Do you wish your hands 
Were my hand 
Making you scream

Do you think of me 
Do you wish I was there 
Killing you softly 
Do you 
Do you 
Do you 

Do you still close your eyes

Do you 
Do you lick your lips 
Remembering how it tasted 
Do you miss the tender

Do your fingers do the walking

Oh, no 
Oh, no 

7 a.m. when reality sets in 
See, last night we said and did some things 
That we shouldn'ta did 
I know the morning after's always harder 
Than the night before, for sure 
Now we're lying here 
Trying to figure what we're suppose to do 
We're both wondering if we're getting back together 
Or I'm leaving you 
We had one drink too many, one kiss too many 
One ""No don't you say another word"" too many 
And it led us to the morning after 

1 - Last night when the love was too strong 
We couldn't fight it and you stayed 
Just a little too long 
So for now it's morning and yesterday's gone 
But can we move on? 

We ask ourselves ""Why oh why"" a thousand times, yeah 
And separately, silently in our heads 
We rehearse the lines 
I had a nice time (So did I) 
I gotta go now (Me too) 
Hit my pager (Certainly) 
Call me later (Most definitely) 
And then we leave 

Later on that day around six 
I get a call from you 
The slight tremble in your voice let me know 
Something wasn't cool 
And if I could turn bak the hands of time 
I'd go back to yesterday before we lost our mind 
To see if we'd do it all again

Montell Jordan,"Well here is my story that I tell to you 
You may not believe me but I swear it's true 
I escaped to Havana for a getaway 
In a tiny club with a cuban band on a Saturday 

And that's when I saw her from across the room 
Like something from a movie or a storybook 
She had a short dress with curly hair and chocolate skin 
That's how it all began 

I remember when she came into my life 
And all at once-upon-a-time 
Love was in the air 
Just like an ocean breeze 
And we were dancing to the sweetest melodies 
I held her in my arms until she danced into the night 
It happened all at once-upon-a-time 
Once upon a time 

Hifuela mijo tell me what happened next 

The next day I was walking to the marketplace 
I passed by the cathedral so I stopped to pray 
I imagined this journey without my friend 
And just like an angel she appeared again 
But before I could ask her why she had gone 
The Padre started yelling that ""She's the one"" 
And suddenly the Policia were everywhere with chaos in the air 

I remember when she had to say goodbye 
And all at once-upon-a-time 
I could not believe they said she was a thief 
And I stood there as they drove her away from me 
And what was I to do, now they've accused her of a crime 
It happened all at once-upon-a-time 

I remember when I couldn't sleep that night 
And all at once-upon-a-time 
I had to find a way to bring her back to me 
So I made a plan of how to set her free 
And so tomorrow night, mi amore I will find 
It happened all at once-upon-a-time 
Once upon a time 

So tell me, how did you get outta there? 

He disguised himself in sheets 
Waited for the guards to fall asleep 
Snuck into the tower, took the keys 
And then I told the girl, stick close to me 
He was in a sword fight 'till the death 
Everyone that watched just held their breath 
And then he ran 
I ran 
Jumped 
I jumped 
Climbed 
Faster and faster and faster 

Guards, stop him! Don't let him get away, Guards! 

I remember when she came back in my life 
And all at once-upon-a-time 
We made our getaway to another time and place 
We were riding while the tears rolled down her face 
She knows I can not stay so we'll say our goodbyes tonight 
It happened all at once-upon-a-time 

I remember when he came into my life 
Love was in the air like an ocean breeze 
Sweetest melodies 
Until she danced into the night 
It happened all at once-upon-a-time 
Once upon a time",Once upon a Time

Listen
Shh..
You hear that?
Can you hear that?
Listen

Ohh, ohh, ohh

Lying in my bedroom next to me
Nervous like a child playing hide and seek
I never knew how fast that your heart could beat
It's like it's your first time

But now that your intentions have been revealed
You wanna feel what lovers feel
There's no need to pretend if you don't know how
I'm gonna show you now

1 - Just say what you're feeling
Your secret is safe with me
Tell me your deepest thoughts
Whisper your fantasies
My love will never stop
I'll kiss you as every drop
Of the rain drops down

No, you're not dreaming
This is reality
More than you bargained for
All that you'll ever need
Everytime you come
It's like heaven opens up
And the rain comes down

First you'll feel all warm and tingly
Right before your legs start trembling
And you explode, from your head to your toes
You're feeling something that you never felt before

Together we'll experience the warmth inside
Until the very moment that we both arrive
You'll scream, shake and cry
Feeling so remarkable, it's hard to describe

Repeat 1

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Making love in the rain
Losing ourselves in the storm again
Goin' everywhere
This is the closest that we'll ever come to heaven
Ahh

No you're not dreaming
Don't be afraid
This is the way we're gonna stay
No you're not dreaming
I'll keep your secret from yourself inside the living (?)

How much longer 'til you let me taste your lips?
You can make a nigga wait if that's your thing
But anticipation drivin' me insane

I'm losing my composure
Tryin' to keep my cool
You start me, then you stop me
So what am I supposed to do?
Sometimes you be actin' so scared
When you know in my heart that I care

[Chorus]
Why can't we, just get past the smalltalk and formalities?
want to tell you that I want you, but it seems so hard
To let down my guard, and reveal my cards
Your body's convincin' me, so why can't we?
Get right to the foreplay, and right now we'll be
Got me dippin' in your ocean, did I go to deep?
I'm just tryin' to see, baby why can't we?

Now I'm working hard to build your trust in me
But I can see that's not gon' happen easily
When you're livin' in your past and in your pain
It's so hard to let your roses bloom again, again

I'm never gonna judge you
Girl you know it's true
I'll take care of your garden
That's what I intend to do
You won't have to be so scared

Montell Jordan,"VERSE 1
I know I've spent my whole life running from you
Even though there's been some things you needed me to do
I did it my way and hurt you over and over again
But you were preparing me
To carry out your plan
Though you said that you'd walk with me, some won't believe
Cause the messenger you chose sings R&B
So the man that you rescued me from is the man that they still
And I don't know what to say
I need you to speak for me

CHORUS
So Lord, this is my prayer
Your â??work in progressâ?? humbly asks of thee
Once your promise is fulfilled, the world will be watching anxiously
Lord help someone to see, the YOU in ME
Lord help just one to see, the YOU in ME

VERSE 2
Someone listening right now needs to hear this tonight
Cause you're lonely and there's an emptiness you're trying to fill in your life
Well I guarantee that my God can do it, yes He can
His name is JESUS
You've got to let him in, and say

CHORUS
Lord, this is my prayer
Your â??work in progressâ?? humbly asks of thee (of thee, of thee)
When your promise has been fulfilled
And the whole world is watching anxiously
Lord help someone to see, the YOU in ME (Oh Lord)
Just help one to see, the YOU in ME (Please Jesus)
If only one could see, the YOU in ME

BISHOP EDDIE L. LONG
I want to speak to you right now
In the midst of your struggles, in the midst of your pain, in the midst of your
Confusion
You wonder, â??why am I here?â?? Glad you asked that questions
God said, You're set apart for a special work, for His glory
That others will see you, but not see you and see HIM
Oh you need to hear this; you need to hear this because
You've been listening to the wrong people
He ordained you, and you don't need anyone else's approval
You've come fully equipped to do what God ordained you to do
You existed with God, even before you were formed in your mother's womb
God knew you
It is amazing
You've tried everybody and everything
Jesus says, â??stop fighting Godâ?? stop fighting
He's knocking at your heart, saying, â??let me inâ??
You're so special
Let the glory of the Lord come through you, in the midst of all your confusion
He loves you

REPEAT CHORUS/ADLIB/END

Lord, Lord my, my, my, my prayer
I'm just a work in progress, but
I'm asking you, I'm begging youâ?¦
When you're promise has been fulfilled, and the world is watching anxiously
Come on and help someone, Oh Lord
I don't want nobody to see Montell, if they can't see you
I'm talking to somebody, can I get a witness
You gotta see past the man, in order to see the You in me

'Cause this type of song will take you back in the day

Where the khakis hang low and gang bangers don't play

Walked down the hall
Kissed my Apollian poster on the wall
My first day of high school, on my way
You need to eat your breakfast
Mom I am late
Funky fresh, stepped into the school
And that's when I say her standing with this dude
Young, tender, sweet Denise
To take her on a date you need a thousand dollars at least
Plus she's used to dating dope dealers
Cats with felonies who tote heaters
You won't believe what's in the second verse
You better buckle up, its bout to get worse

[Chorus:]
Can't believe that that's Denise
The one from high school
With the dope body
But now she is out there going for broke
And all her dreams went up in smoke
(Repeat 2X)

Two years later, and things have changed
Hip hop evolved into a whole new game
NWA's holding down my block
Denise graduated the school of hard knocks
She made a few connects
Didn't skip a beat
Got a little deeper hooked up on the street
And wherever they led her, she would follow
Now she rocks fashions like a runway model
Jewelry, Louis, Gucci and guess
Delivering more packages than UPS
From Miami to NY
Sometimes to Rome
But niecy always seemed to make it back home
Now I am eighteen and to my surprise
Niecy got babies by two",Denise

I want you, I need you, were having, make up sex

Montell Jordan,"[Chorus]
Got so, many, questions
Everyone wants to know
Where you been, what you doing
how's your life
Questions [Repeat: x 2]

Everybody
Wants to know
what's my story, so here I go
I moved from Cali

A year ago
Switched my style up, on the low
I won't discuss things form my past
I said Id leave it

But since you asked
Sometimes labels don't last
But true artists can stand the test

[Pre-Chorus]
So let them say what they want to say
(Tumors) about you
they're always in your business people

[Chorus: x 2]

When you are surrounded 
With friends like these
You gotta figure out
who's the enemy?

You talk about me
You do me wrong
They think I am weak
But they make me strong

Sometimes I wish I could disappear
For the child we lost
I shed a tear
I won't pretend to understand
I'm leave it all, in Gods hands

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

Montgomery Gentry,"Sometimes I think what turned her on was my ole' broke down boots
She wanted her a real cowboy, it was a phase she was going through
Not one week after she moved in and I caught her paintin' the bedroom blue
Brought home a bottle of pink Chablis, poured out my best home-brew
I was sittin' on the porch in my over-alls as she packed her things to leave
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

She changed direction, headed out West
She changed her tune to some Hip-Hop mess
Her dark brown hair went to blonde and her pretty blue eyes went to green
She changed everything when she couldn't change me

She was sittin' beside the ocean, lookin' out at the waves
Watchin' how they keep on rollin'
But always seemed the same
She called and said she'd been thinkin' about all those quiet country nights
And whatever she thought was so wrong with me
Suddenly seemed alright
I was sittin' on the porch in my over-alls when her truck pulled into view
She said I changed my mind when I couldn't change you

She changed direction, headed back home
She changed her tune, it's all Haggard and Jones
Had her dark brown hair pulled back and the bluest eyes you ever seen
She changed everything when she couldn't change me

She said I guess when you love someone, you just gotta let it be
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

He's got a redneck side when you get him agitated
He got the gold toothed look from a stiff right hook
He's proud he took for his right wing stand on Vietnam
Says he lost his brother there

He yells out Johnny Cash

And stands there by the stage

Hard on the side of my head
I just learned to stay out of his way

Long nights with the world sittin' on my chest
It just showed me how much I could take
Hard times, bad luck
Sometimes life sucks

Lazy summer sundown, front porch of this old house,
Lightning bugs in a mason jar, 
There's a four-lane comming through, they break ground at the end of June,
The counties taking half my yard

It don't matter too much anyway, in the scheme of things,
I still get more than I should

It's all good , It's alright, 
Lord it's always a good day when you're glad to be alive,
Everything I need, ain't too hard to find,
So I don't waste my time complaining,
Cause I don't see how I could,
It's all good

Another bill in the box today, new boats gonna have to wait,
My pick-up truck just broke down,
Grass needs mowing, I hear the plants closing,

That'll never change,

Montgomery Gentry,"I met her down in Tampa Bay
Spring Break '88
She came in to hear my band play
And man, we were on that night
Twin guitars and twenty minute jams
Tush, Cocaine, Sweet Home Alabama
I knew I had her in the palm of my hand 
When I stepped in the spotlight
Hot and heavy in that little alley
On a fifteen minute break
We shared a cigarette, a long kiss
Then she stood there by the stage
All night by the stage
Man, what can I say
She loved me
After five long years of tryin to be a star
I sold my axe and I quit them bars
Got a real job fixin trucks and cars
Had a couple new mouths to feed
But eventually that monthly wage 
And the finer points of the suburban age
All became bars on a cage
And man it was killin me
I started cussin, gettin mad at nothin
And blamin her for ruinin my life
Started sinkin, cheatin, and-a drinkin
But she stood there by my side
Right there by my side
With tears in her eyes
And she loved me
She loved me
Heaven knows the reasons why
I'll never know the reasons why
She loved me
She finally left three years ago
Married a man out in New Mexico
Calls to say the boys are really growin
God, I miss them kids
As for me, I'm twelve steps down the line
I found a church that I like just fine
I even got a gig playin these songs of mine
They all just reminisce
Hot and heavy in that little alley
On a fifteen minute break
We shared a cigarette, a long kiss
Then she stood there by the stage
All night by the stage
Man, those were the days 
When she loved me

Montgomery Gentry,"There's a story that my daddy tells religiously
Like clockwork every time he sees an opening
In a conversation about the way things used to be
Well I'd just roll my eyes and make a be	-line for the door
But I'd always wind up starry-eyed, cross-legged on the floor
Hanging on to every word
Man, the things I heard
It was harder times and longer days
Five miles to school, uphill both ways
We were cane switch raised, and dirt floor poor
'Course that was back before the war
Yeah, your uncle and I made quite a pair
Flying F-15's through hostile air
He went down but they missed me by a hair
He'd always stop right there and say...

That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
That's a chin held high as the tears fall down
A gut sucked in, a chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a-flyin'
Or a newborn baby cryin'
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of

Son graduate from college, that was mama's dream
But I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned 18
'cause when you gotta fast car you think you've got everything
I learned quick those GTO's don't run on faith
I ended up broken down in some town north of L.A.
Working maximum hours for minimum wage
Well, I fell in love, next thing I know
The babies came, the car got sold
I sure do miss that old hot rod
But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs
Dad, I wonder if I ever let you down
If you're ashamed how I turned out
Well, he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow
Said, let me tell ya right now

That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
You don't need to make a million
Just be thankful to be workin'
If you're doing what you're able
And putting food there on the table
And providing for the family that you love
That's something to be proud of

And if all you ever really do is the best you can
Well, you did it man

That's a life you can hang your hat on

Montgomery Gentry,"His old man was a rebel yeller
Bad boy to the bone
He'd say: ""Can't trust that other fella.""
He'd judge 'em by the tone of their skin
He was raised to think like his Dad
Narrow mind full of hate
On the road to nowhere fast
Till the grace of God got in the way
Then he saw the light an' hit his knees, an' cried, an' said a prayer
Rose up a brand new man
Left the old one right there

Here's to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope
Some people change
Against all odds
Against the grain
Love finds a way
Some people change

She was born with her mother's habit
You could say: ""It's in her blood.""
She hates that she's gotta have it
As she fills her glass up
An' she'd love to kill that bottle
But all she can think about
Is a, a better life, a second chance
An' everyone she's letting down
She throws that bottle down

Save the whales and no more news

Couple rifles and a gun rack
Behind a soccer mom in a Uconn

Their only common thread

But there they go making the world go round

Montgomery Gentry,"I was at that smart ass time of my life
Where id pick a fight just to pick a fight
If he said black, I said white
If he took one side I took the other side
The dinner table we sat around
Was more like a battleground
And I lost more times than I won
I would of learned later on

That he was always preaching bout his past
I just kept screaming"" Come on, dad!
That was twenty years ago
You don't know me at all!
Trying to talk to you is like talking to the wall
Yeah, you gave me my life, but its my life to live
Maybe I don't wanna live it like you did, Twenty years ago""

He was built with blue collar sweat and blood
Squared jaw and a crew cut
A purple heart, a Viet Vet.
He'd tell you every chance he'd get
Always running down my rock n' roll,

But one night it got out of control
And right there we came to blows
And that was just enough to get me gone
I couldn't wait to prove him wrong!

Twenty years ago
Struck out on my own
Couldn't tell me nothing
That I didn't already know
Later I was on my way
To what the hell did I care
My old man and his gray hair
Thought about the road I chose
Twenty years ago

""Well I left as fast as the leaves fell that autumn
I never looked back and I never once called him
But every time I talked to momma
I wondered if he was there,or if he even cared
I figured I walked out of him and the course of our love had run
Momma said 'no,no, you listen to me son, hes a stubborn man and he won't give in.
He believes what he believes, well you're just like him'
Well I could tell by her voice there was something wrong
She broke down, and said he ain't got long
So I caught the next plane home,
Thought about all the years gone
Had my pride that I let so much time go by
I ran up those stairs and stood by his bed
And I cried""

Twenty years ago
Thought I knew it all
But trying to talk to me
Was like talking to a wall
I thought I was a man

Just before my dad gave up the ghost
He took my hand and said ""son let it go, that was twenty years ago""

Reverend Jones, he struts and dances while the guitar plays "" Amazing Grace"". 
He testifies in tongues of fire with tears of joy runnin' down his face. 
He ain't sure and we ain't sure exactly what he said. 
But praise the lord and pass me a copperhead.

You won't find many hypocrites that'll take a chance on gettin' bit. 
But a true believer can survive rattlesnakes and cyanide.

When you hold that deadly viper keep the Holy Spirit in your mind. 
Do not loose your concentration or that serpent's surely bound to strike. 
Either way you won't forget the first time that you said.

Being laid to rest while his mom stood by his side

I swear a lot of big things are waitin' on you
And we all got to do what we gotta do
I won't lie, this is breakin' my heart
And I know it's gonna leave a good mark
And when it heals, I'll be fine
But I got the chance to dance with you one time

They may look like scars to you
Some of my life's best tattoos
The wear and tear, the black and blue
That's just livin'
It goes to show you paid your dues
Those you win and those you lose
All the way with no excuse
That's just livin'
That's just livin'

Of all the roads you took
Turns you wish you'd taken slower
It's all you've got to show
Girl when this whole thing is over

They may look like scars to you
Some of my life's best tattoos
The wear and tear, the black and blue
That's just livin'
It goes to show you paid your dues
Those you win and those you lose
Turn the page with no excuse
That's just livin'
They may look like scars to you
Some of my life's best tattoos
The wear and tear, the black and blue
That's just livin'
It goes to show you paid your dues
Those you win and those you lose
All the way with no excuse
That's just livin'
That's just livin'

That's just livin'",That's Just Living
Montgomery Gentry,"Two old friends, havin' a beer
Catchin' up, man don't the years fly by
Two old friends, laugh 'til it hurts
To stories they already heard a thousand times
Like no time has passed
Almost like they're back

Leanin' on a Chevrolet, drinkin' down a summer day
Talkin' 'bout far away places they ain't been
One's headed for the coast, the other where the wind blows
Ain't it funny how the road always beats again
Two old friends

Two old friends, comparin' scars
Haven't changed who they are, deep down
They ride that time machine
Back to 17

Leanin' on a Chevrolet, drinkin' down a summer day
Talkin' 'bout far away places they ain't been
One's headed for the coast, the other where the wind blows
Ain't it funny how the road always beats again
Like two old friends

The places closin' down
They're still hangin' 'round

Leanin' on a Chevrolet, drinkin' down a summer day
Leanin' on a Chevrolet, drinkin' down a summer day
Talkin' 'bout far away places they ain't been

Montgomery Gentry,"You wouldn't even know it's there
Piece of racetrack road somewhere
Underneath that new four lane
There's Chevy rubber that bears my name
Yeah we used to own this town
We used to burn it down
Left some circles 'round that square
Left some crazy everywhere

Had to cover our tracks in the blacktop
Turned a stomping ground into a parking lot
Painted over our names, but so what?
We were here, we were here
Might have let that bridge on the river rust
The [?] grow wild where the party was
Ain't a footprint left down in that mud
But we were here, we were here

Somewhere along a back road fence
We lost some backseat innocence
You shook me all night long
We'll always be more than a song
Her name was worth the climb
Stayed up there a long time
Things changed and so did we
But you, can't erase a memory

Had to cover our tracks in the blacktop
Turned a stomping ground into a parking lot
Painted over our names, but so what?
We were here, we were here
Might have let that bridge on the river rust
The [?] grow wild where the party was
Ain't a footprint left down in that mud
But we were here, we were here

Montgomery Smith,"I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad good-byes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

Shoulda known better than to cheat a friend
And waste this chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Tonight the music seems so loud
I am wishing that we could lose this crowd
But maybe it's better this way
We hurt each other with the things we wanna say

We could have been so good together
We could have danced this dance forever
But no one's gonna dance with me
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're, know you're not a fool

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her

Oh girl, I’d be in trouble if you left me now
’Cos I don’t know where to look for love, I just don’t know how
Oh girl, how I depend on you to give me love when I need it
Right on time you would always be there

All my friends call me a fool
They say let the woman take care of you
So I try to be hip and think like the crowd
But even the crowd can't help me now

Oh girl tell me, tell me what am I gonna do?
And I know I've got a guilty face
Girl I feel so out of place

Yeah girl, what am I gonna do? Do
What am I gonna do?
If you leave me baby what am I gonna do?
I don’t know where to go, who to see yeah

Oh girl, I guess I’ll never know
I can save myself a lot of useless tears
Girl I’ve gotta get away from here
Oh girl, girl, girl pain will double if you leave me now

I don't know how, oh no

Montgomery Smith,"A young gentleman came riding past,
On a snow blue winters day,
He asked to drink by our fire
And I was pleased to let him stay,

He drank there quietly for a while,
And then he turned and said to me,

Your eyes are green,
Like summer grass,
Your lips are red,
Like a fresh cut rose,
Your hair is soft,
Like an Irish stream,
And your voice,
Is filled with sweet beauty

And the last words I heard him say

Were I shall return,
For you,
My love,
On Christmas Day

And the night will come,
But I won't sleep,
As I watch the stars that lead him,
I cannot place where he is,
But still my heart goes with him,
I'm saving all my Sunday clothes
For the day that I'll be leaving,
Father knows,
My sister knows,
And my friends,
They're happy for me,
And the priest he says,
You should thank God,
For the blessing,
Of such beauty

And the last words
I heard him say,

Were I shall return,
For you,
My love,
On Christmas Day
I shall return,
For you,
My love,
On Christmas Day

(On Christmas Day)

I heard him say
Were the last words
I ever
Heard him say

I shall return,
For you,

I swear,
I will return,

Month of Sundays,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee

 That saved a wretch like me. 
 I once was lost but now I'm found, 
 Was blind but now I see. 
 T'was grace that taught my heart to fear 
 And grace my fear relieved 
 How precious did that grace appear, 
 The hour I first believed. 
 Through many dangers, toils and snares 
 We have already come 
 T'was grace that brought us safe thus far 
 And grace will lead us home.

Oh, I've got a girl with a record machine
When it comes to rockin' she's a queen
Love to dance on a Saturday night
All alone, I can hold her tight
But she lives on a twentieth floor up town
The elevator's broken down

So I climbed one, two flight, three flight, four
Five, six, seven flight, about eight flight more
On the twelfth I started to drag
By the fifteenth floor I'm ready to sag
Get to the top, But I'm too tired to rock

She called me up on the telephone
She said c'mon over, Cause I'm all alone
I said baby, you're mighty sweet
But I'm in the bed with a-achin' feet
This went on for a couple of days

'Till it's fixed I'm using the stairs
I hope they hurry up before it's too late
Because I don't want my baby too much to wait

Had to be
No escape, no room for doubt
No way out
Seeing you, it was easy to decide
Cut and dried
Had to be
Now we know why we exist
Don't resist, don't even think at all
Simply fall
In love
This is what
Had to be

She was easy to seduce
Let her loose
In a world where the fake and shallow shine
She'll be fine
Had to be
She's a woman, nothing more
Falling for whatever comes along
She's so wrong
A fool
To herself
Had to be

Don't ever tell me
How to live my life, tell me who I should love
No don't ever tell me
What to say or do in the life I will share with you

Had to be (no one can tell me)
For we get what we deserve (how I should live my life)
Lose your nerve (no one can tell me)
And the fates hustle in and take control (or take control)
Of your soul
Had to be
Of your fool
Had to be
But the spark of hope remains
And sustains the echo of a smile
For a while (no one can tell me)
We're fools
To ourselves--have to be (no one has told me)
We're fools (it had to be)
To ourselves
Had to be

Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

Content to stargaze at the skies.

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Monty Alexander,"Why don't you stop
And look me over
Am I the same girl you used to know?

Why don't you stop
And think it over
Am I the same girl who you hurt so?

I'm the one you want
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one you love
I'm the one you used to meet

Around the corner
Everyday
We would meet
And slip away
But we were much too young
To love each other this way

Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)
Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)

Why don't you stop
And look me over
Am I the same girl you used to know?
Why don't you stop
And think it over
Am I the same girl who you hurt so?

I'm the one you hurt
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one who cried
I'm the one you used to meet
But you are pretending you don't care
But the fire is still there
Now we are no longer too young
To love each other this way

Am I the same girl?

Monty Alexander,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,

Monty Alexander,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura
Monty Alexander,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

Monty Alexander,"A time for summer skies
For hummingbirds and butterflies
For tender words that harmonize with love

A time for climbing hills
For leaning out of windowsills
Admiring daffodils above

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above
I know a time for spring
A time for fall
But best of all
A time for love

Monty Alexander,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Monty Alexander,"Sei calda come i baci che ho perduto
Sei piena di un amore che a passato
Che il cuore mio vorrebbe cancellar

Odio l'estate
Il sole che ogni giorno ci saldava
Che splendidi tramonti dipingeva
Addeso brucia solo con furor

Tornerà un altro inverno
Cadranno mille petali di rose
La neve coprirà tutte le cose
E forse un po' di pace tornerà

Monty Alexander,"Love, look at the two of us, 
Strangers, in many ways, 
We've got a lifetime to share, 
So much to say, 

And, as we go, from day to day, 
I'll feel you close to me, 
But, time alone will tell, 
Let's take a lifetime to say,

For only time will tell us so, 
And love may grow, 
For all we know!",For All We Know
Monty Alexander,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",That Old Devil Moon
Monty Are I,"All her hopes and dreams are below:

She closed her eyes, and then the girl was standing on the sky.
And through the clouds, with diamond eyes, she saw herself in the city. (the city)

She looks into the mirror and sees diamonds and grace.
Pure innocence, by the look on her face.
She thinks out loud and says,
""Your words are like the kindling to my fire,
And I've got tunnel vision and the light's not hard to find
The words that I sing say.""

And floating on above the world she waves the past goodbye.
And with a smile she finally found her destiny in the city.",Island City
Monty Are I,"And ever since I left it all, I really felt I let you down. 
But we could count stories with my sheets
Two lovers in a noisy town. 
The good times don't mean shit when I'm relying on telephone lines 
To keep you from crying, so you don't leave me. 

And I must pray. 
Forgive me for saying, 
""Was this a mistake?"" But we can dream
But it's a complicated mess, and what it comes down to is just me. 
What if we touch lips just this once, and a blindfold leads to sinning? 
And she said, ""Holding my hand makes me comfortable, 
And just surround me with loving, baby. 

Not gonna wait around, cause I'm falling down and you're leaving town."" 
Thought she was fearfully free. 
And I just made up my mind, just in time for you to leave me. 
Now that that's out of the way. 

Invested all our time, for three great years we had a good scare. 
Now come give me a sign that you're just not messing with my mind.",Just in Time
Monty Are I,"O brother where are you? (face forward and stop thinking.)
Do you admit regret in times of doubt? (we will think for you.)
A life of gun in hand, with a dedication to your land,
Inside out you've shown it's not what life's all about.

No, we can not believe in what you said,
When your whole life's been a sacrifice mislead (mislead.)

But we still hold the pride.
When the gun smoke clears, we'll still salute you.
When you return by the tides,
We'll be here to see your life through.

I'm confused and punctured,
My conscience is my only means of direction.
Did I sign up for suicide, of a saddened bride?
Three more years, no white picket fencing, and suffering a mental conviction.

Please, don't you think that now we will look down,
On a man who's realized what's true to him now? (to him now)

But we still hold the pride.
When the gun smoke clears, we'll still salute you.
When you return by the tides,
We'll be here to see your life through. (to see your life)

It's not giving up, it's seeing what else there's to see.
When you're soon set free, there is so much more than a camouflaged hell.
So cock the gun and fire into the eyes of a great desire.
A fleeting destiny that is turned into what is considered to be normal.
And I'm here for you.

No, we can not believe in what you said,
When your whole life's been a sacrifice mislead (mislead.)

But we still hold the pride.
When the gun smoke clears, we'll still salute you.
When you return by the tides,

Monty Lane Allen,"It used to seem to me that my life ran on too fast
And I had to take it slowly just to make the good parts last
But when you're born to run it's so hard to just slow down
So don't be surprised to see me back in that bright part of town

I'll be back in the high life again
All the doors I closed one time will open up again
I'll be back in the high life again
All the eyes that watched me once will smile and take me in

And I'll drink and dance with one hand free
Let the world back into me and on I'll be a sight to see
Back in the high life again

You used to be the best to make life be life to me
And I hope that you're still out there and you're like you used to be
We'll have ourselves a time
And we'll dance till the morning sun
And we'll let the good times come in
And we won't stop till we're done
