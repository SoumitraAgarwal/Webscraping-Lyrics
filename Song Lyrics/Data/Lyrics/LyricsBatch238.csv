Kastelruther Spatzen,"Ein Mädchen mit traurigen Augen
Stand Nachts auf der Brücke der Seen
Sie hatte Ihr liebstes verloren
Wie sollte ihr Herz das versteh'n
Da brach eine Frau aus dem Dunkel
Die Nacht war auf einmal so hell
Geh hin zu den heiligen Wassern
Wo auch heute noch Wunder gescheh'n
Wenn Menschen einander verlassen
Wird Maria die Tränen versteh'n
Sie kennt jeden Schmerz dieser Erde
Und sie kennt deinen Kummer dein Leid
Und Wunder an heiligen Wassern
Ja das gibt es auch noch heut

Sie hörte ganz leis eine Stimme
Du gehst diesen Weg nicht allein
Du siehst auch die Tränen der andern
Das macht deinen Kummer ganz klein
Dein Glaube er wird dich begleiten
Er führt dich heraus aus der Nacht
Geh hin zu den heiligen Wassern
Wo auch heute noch Wunder gescheh'n
Wenn Menschen einander verlassen
Wird Maria die Tränen versteh'n
Sie kennt jeden Schmerz dieser Erde
Und sie kennt deinen Kummer dein Leid
Und Wunder an heiligen Wassern
Ja das gibt es auch noch heut

Auf dem Weg nach Lourd schien die Sonne
Hat sie später den Kindern erzählt
Und mit mir ging damals ein Fremder
Der auch heut' meine Hände noch hält
Wir gingen zuheiligen Wassern
Wo auch heute noch Wunder gescheh'n
Wenn Menschen einander verlassen
Wird Maria die Tränen versteh'n

Damned choirs of ghosts arouses fear
Haunting my house for zears

Billions of teeth you have bitch
Wanting to bite throught iron walls
And power of fate

You got me

Drink blood

Pagan lust, frenzy - stop it
Bestial thought keeps telling me
Come - my body, lets spin
Hum of the world fades
Only your scream
Come to last vampire

You got me
You vampire
Drink blood.

You say you a gangsta, ain’t seen a thing you've done
I do it all on myself, I ain’t getting help
From no one, from no one

Yeah I’m young, 21, living in a crazy world
But I know the difference between a man and a herb
You frontin’ like you got it, claim they hatin’ on your wallet
Gucci telling you the time and you watch it
No I ain't stunting like my daddy, he’s livin’ with my granny
Used to be a big baller, he's surviving off of gambling
But I love him he’s my daddy, yeah I love him he’s my daddy
Put him in a big house before I ever see a Grammy
And my mommy started working days at the church
Finding faith in God cause the real world hurts, so much evil lurks
They just make us work but we can’t find work
Abuela, mommy and the girls in a one bedroom
South beach lifestyle, they just paying for the view
Mommy on the couch since she was 42
Sacrificing for the kids cause that’s what mommies do
So I smoke my spliff, I spliff it hard
Candi says to stop, my voice is getting too harsh
So I sobered up and my thoughts they rush
And now I think of you behind bars
Cross state lines, they spliffing good
In Miami you catch a charge and the whole family tears apart

You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none

And this recession so depressing
My parents don’t stop stressing
Just hoping I learned all their lessons
Mm and I’m paying for this session, I’m paying for this session
And I’m paying rent, food, clothes, phones, Christmas presents
Six shots in, I’m just counting all my blessings
No days off baby, I ain’t resting
I told my sins, now I'm done confessing

You say you a gangsta, that don’t impress me none

One way to the top, I'll make with what I got
You want my number, baby, I’m on a mission, catch up
Men selling love like thieves
But when the girlie leaves he’ll start flirting with me
So I took on my heart, off my sleeve
Never trust a man cause they all hungry
Yeah, they all hungry

Oo he got me, he shot me good
Oo he got me, he shot me good

You, you treat me like a fool
You're making me feel used, by you
Oh what do I do to break loose
Oo I'm so confused
I guess I'll pay my dues
Why do I like this abuse, by you
Oh what do I do to break loose
You're just another dude

I used stand so tall
Now I can't stand at all
Baby made me fall
He shot me on the wall
Oo he got me, he shot me good
Oo he got me
He had the gun he had the pen I was the mark

Oo baby you, you treat me like a fool
You're making me feel used, by you
Oh what do I do to break loose
Oo I'm so confused
I guess I'll pay my dues
Why do I like this abuse, by you
Oh what do I do to break loose

Oo baby you got me running running running running all over town
I got nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing to show
But these wounds are proof
It's all cause of you, cause of you

Don't act like that's a disease
Need ya'll to bear with me please
I just say what I see
We all just chasing a dream
In the land of the free
While we payin' a fee
To stay on this concrete

Well, I don't know the price of your roof
But, the first of the month we all pay our dues
When the rain falls, it don't rain on a few
When the sun shine, it don't shine just on you

I don't know the monsters you knew
But I'm tryin to forget the ones I met too
Maybe you can help me
Maybe I can help you

You look at me and you see what I see
Because you're looking in the mirror
When you're with me there's no use in hiding
Because you're looking in the mirror

Don't look away
Because you're looking in the mirror
'Cause maybe, maybe, maybe we're just the same
Because you're looking in the mirror

We're all crossing paths
For a reason, I know that
Hoping just to share some laughs
Avoid the broken glass
Have I met you in the past
In a life that I lived last
You know they go too fast
God knows they go too fast

Well, I don't know the monsters you knew
But I'm tryin to forget the ones I met too
Maybe you can help me
Maybe Imma help you

And when I wake
I hear the same wave of sirens
Coming down my way
And I'll never try to leave you

Baby, don't look away
I am you

Saturday Sunday Saturday Sunday
Maybe I'll get it right one day

Got my makeup on my face
Who am I today
Is today a new day
Am I in a maze
With me knees to the ground, head facing down to pray
While I'm a thousand miles away
No time or space

O preacher you're way too loud
My head's spinning round
Watch my gown
He's dressed in black
Don't let me drown
Oh preacher it's way too soon
It's Saturday night, a Sunday afternoon
Who do I tell my stories to
Is the DJ in the confession booth

Is it Saturday Sunday Saturday Sunday
Poppin shots down the same lips that I pray
Saturday Sunday Saturday Sunday
Maybe I'll get it right one day

Bodies all around hypnotized by the sound that surrounds
Don't count me out
Has a savior been found
Spirits in my system
Trying to resist them no
They will not go
Pour the wine slow

O preacher you're way too loud

Watch my gown

Don't let me drown

It's Saturday night, a Sunday afternoon
Who do I tell my stories to

I'm going, going, so we can cure my abuse
Say nothing I hold this in for my own use
I'm going, going so we can cure my abuse of you

Yo sé donde yo vine
Y se pa' donde voy
No tiene que esperarme

Mi corazón esta en Miami
Aunque en Jersey estoy

My mommy misses me my mommy misses me
And I'll admit sometimes I miss her times three,
 it's the same to my brothers and my sisters in Miami,
 ari, Sidney, Nikki, Val, Vikki, and Jerry, 
I'm sitting here in dirty Jersey
201, It's Hudson County
 but they've been coming through, they've been loving the Hue,
But I'm still on the boulevard looking at the view,

Y cuando bailo ten cuidao
Well I ain't changing my style

Soy su favorita mesera
Mi mano en la cadera
I flirt a little it's betta
Respeta mi manera
De llenar a mi cartera
Soy un poquito salsera
Cantante, quizás rapera
Si lo supieras invirtiera
Mira mira
Aquí tienes tu bebida
Henny puro y un Tequila
Pronto sale la comida
Gotta go and get it
Eso siempre me motiva
No soy mal agradecida
30 Por ciento me inspira
Tengo que llenar mi vida
De lo que es destino pida
Muchas luces y cámaras
Siempre piensan que yo soy diva
Una mirada seductiva
Hago que todos me sigan

Échale azúcar y melao
Y cuando bailo ten cuidao
Well I ain't changing my style

Muevo tu cuerpo
Pa' arriba y pa' abajo
Yo quiero verte sudando

Kat Dahlia,"You shed ya light, you left me blind
But I could never turn away
Whether ya black, whether ya white
You always left me in the grey
And my shadow's cruel

Are you changing you
You bring the rain, you bring the night
I never get the time of day
I wanna cry, you wanna fight
All this loving goes in vain
Wish you wore my shoes
'Cause I've torn them through
But what would that prove
I'm so confused
I'm not dealing too well, cause I just can't tell
If I'm entering the gates of, Heaven or Hell
Can I trust you? 'Cause I just can't tell
I know you so well

I'm attracted to the ocean, just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water
If I'm attracted to the ocean, just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water
And I'm drowning in emotion
You're quickly suffocating, wish I was a little taller
If I'm attracted to the ocean, just because I feel it

Can I walk upon the water
And now I'm drowning in emotion
You're quickly suffocating, wish I was a little taller
If I'm attracted to the ocean, but just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water

It's a storm a brewing, on my horizon
No matter what I'm choosing, baby I ain't deciding
So we shine, so we shine
A cat told me catch a knife. I'll trade ya promise for my life

I'm attracted to the ocean
But just because I feel it, I can't walk upon the water
If I'm attracted to the ocean
But just because I feel it, I can't walk upon the water
And now I'm drowning in emotion
You're quickly suffocating, wish I was a little taller
If I'm attracted to the ocean
But just because I feel it, I can't walk upon the water

So I could even see my dream far away

We were chilling in the island breeze

Let me take you to your fantasy
Should I stay or should I go
'cause I've been here before
Should I even up the flow
Get back & let it go

That I can fall in love with you

Was the day that you let me go
(It was a blessing in disguise)
Now I see that I'm beautiful
Cause all we ever did was fight
We were so dysfunctional
Now I forgotten all the times
And all the days that I was loving you.

Just like a ghost from my past (he's come back to haunt me)
Saying that you want me back (but that's impossible so)

[Chorus]
If you love me, leave me
Love me, leave me
'cause I've already closed that door
Don't want to be
In the pain I felt before
If I only could be myself
Without your approval anymore
(if you love me leave me)
If you love me leave me alone

Now there used to be a time

(I would've taken you back again)
(Now I got you out of my mind)
Now I'm totally independent
So you can save your little lies
'cause I know what's happenin'
You're missin' me but say goodbye now
To all the days I was lovin' you

Just like a ghost from my past (he's come back to haunt me)
Saying that you want me back (but that's impossible so)

[Chorus]

If you really wanna help
Than you should go
'cause I promised myself
I'd make it alone
At the back of the shelf
'cause where I put what we had
I'll never going back, no

No, no, no, no
Ah ah

I tell a story how, 
I tell that hands and
Reach through love.
I came without his crown, 
Falling queen
As tears come down.
Secretly words
Shedding his demise.
Next to his body, 
You know what's found.
I believe
I can live without, 
The one who cares for me.

[Chorus]
You are only mine, 
I am only yours my baby, 
You are only mine, 
I am only yours

Oh So where do we go now?
When can we fly
Above the clouds?
Just like a tell-a-tale, 
A king and queen
In heaven's frown.
That's how I'm feelin'
About you now, 
Don't wanna live
Without your love, 
I believe
And I've really found, 
The one who cares for me.

You are only mine

I am only yours my baby

You are only mine

Is so precious together
We have grown, we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away
Somewhere alone

It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over
Starting over

Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over

Why don't we take off alone
Take a trip somewhere far, far away

Displacement of three perfect Moons...
Edging the fragments of pace...
To denote the course of a immanent impact...

By force immerges gravity between the globes.

Venus and the Moon were attracted to what would probably be

The infusing lightning discharching those blinding
Sheets of
Lights...
... Sparkling the fierce vessels, who connected,
Eventhough of their mass volumes...
Submitting both of the planets, away...

The radiation of destruction was so strong that
The explosion fissured the chaotic space.
This event defined the Moon... Linked as an
Asteroid junctioned,
To the unveiled face of the Earth.

The mighty concussion severed the Lands...
Deliberating these tremendous screams of fire...
Major depletion within our Sphere... Rivaling the
Global inferno on Earth.
A gigantic typhoon, the Maelstrom formed...
A spiral storm whence came, the omen's

That blazing ring, urging unknown lifeforms res-
Cuing our kind...

Populate, behind the flaming boreal Arc.

How I never could reach my bride

Putrid faces engulfs the path
To the shore of no hope, a bridge
Blackened roses in the cradle of sleep
Whispers: ""our death is eternal""

In silence I fall through sorrows
A dying lord on eternal journey
Your face is torn and lifeless
And the passage is locked now forever

Tearful my face borders the path
Sleeping, dreaming of my bride
And freezing my soul is praying
""take me the way, through the night""",In Silence Enshrined

Katatonia,"Falling, Crying, Sleeping, through the air
with the evil, shadows, moving towards the sky!

Tomb spirits marching in the fields of eternal....life
crying like a God....a terrified...God!!

Falling, crying, sleeping in the air

Souls can't sleep, until the throne's mastering..again!
Tomb of insomnia.........can't sleep

Uh!

Cry!! Cry!! Ahh!! Cry!!

Falling, crying, sleeping the land is weak
With the evil shadows, moving towards the sky!
Tomb spirits marching, in the fields of eternity

Now they fall, behold the angels
Their withering souls, in blood
They can't fly
And in confusing anger, they fall so low
Now I can't sleep
Purest sorrow, embrace my soul
I can't sleep
Ahh!",Tomb of Insomnia
Katatonia,"Ten Strings of Darkness on a Violin Sad
I watch the Mountains where the Frost begins
The Northern Storm is Guiding me
To the Forest

Silently the Nightbirds fly
Their last scream my eternal Dirge
Under the Full moon a Funeral
In the Forest

Still I walk with open wounds but the Third is now rising
Through the ashes of a Dying Love a new soul is born
I watch the feathers like Snow in the Winter
The Angels that fell, splendid to rape

Tall are the shadows that dance before me
As they
Shows the way to the Dawn
An Autumn forest that never reach
Condemned to Sorrow

Chasing the Wind / Like a Spirit fly
Through the Autumn trees / Towards the Sky
Hoofs are pounding / In the clouds above
The Chariot of Sorrow / Watch me die
Hear the Violin / So sad and blackened
Like a Breeze / The songs of Drynhwyl
Chasing the wind / Like my spirit die
Dreaming of the Queen / The queen of roses

Now they die, Pure Sorrow flow
My Souls Funeral, Too close to the End
Now they Die, Purest blood pours
Forever Die, but I must...

I must Die
Through the Sky
And the Forest

Follow the Wind, go North my Child
To the purest of Winters
Go to the Forest that never Ends
There you'll find your fate

And to the North I rode, on the coldest of winds
I watched the Mountains where the frost begun
Where no Angels ever dare to tread
Where Death is all mine

At last I found the Throne of Bereavement
Grim and bleak raised to the Sky
The Velvet Thorns of Drynhwyl are mine
And so are death and sadness

See...
My final Sacrfice
In the trees you will hear my voice
Ever calling ever falling

Flowing tunes on Autumn Funeral
Ashes spread in the Northern Storm",Velvet Thorns (Of Drynwhyl)
Katatonia,"Black theatre of love
Violet dances cast their blood
The moon gave me flowers
For funerals to come

12 shapes bow before her
I am still one of them
12 morbid ways to die
Her beauty scares me

I'm falling deeper
No more pain to feel now
Touch the silence
Afraid of hell

Violet dances cast their blood
The moon gave me flowers
For funerals to come

I cannot breathe
I am losing life

She died so beautiful",12

When the pictures are moving
Between the memories

The sound of falling

Dead in time

Brave, try the meaning of loss
I know your smile is deadly at this point
Wherever you are I am not

Pierced by the darkness
They called it death
And surrounded me with sleep

In marble halls of falling snow

Winter touch the Earth undone

Katatonia,"Open life beneath
Her glory stains the hearse
Procession watch the rain
Mourns the opposite birth
For the wind hopes to die
Far away from home
Same death serves all/Spirits of what will be
Dancing the walls
Scent of silver/through those halls
Shroud of filth embrace me
As the statue stares so cold
Black blue eyes of mourning
Child born to die
Silent tombs wait outside
Monuments of (my) dreamless rains
Torn by the stars
Heaven calls
Burning with sin
Free from within
Endless spikes of certain death, come closer at my hand
Where they will burn in sin, restless wait
The coffin gaps open, laughing at my fear
Silent tombs wait outside
Monuments of (my) dreamless rains
Torn by the stars
Heaven calls
Burning with sin
Free from within

And I can't control anything
When you said that life can't be what you want

When I pray
When I believe

Life itself turned pale and ended
I saw you cry out acres of your image

In lifeless motion you're walking like you're dead

Katatonia,"Dancing through the silent waves
The shimmering moonlight
Over lost angels remains
Whispering through gloomy halls
Beneath the gentle soft caress
Of dreaming shadows
Flowing steams of silver
Through tidal torrents of grief
Time was never there for us
The final tide took the last ones away
Buried visions - of sunrise
Beneath the seas - of torrid soil
Slowly sinking - in the mire
Shades of - emerald fields
Our eyes can't stand the flames
Single sparkles hiding in our palms
They linger before dying away
Fading from out sigh
Loathsome are the ways of those
Who the meadows shall receive
For every glimpse of daylight must vanish
And every soul submit to tide

One thirty breathing lapse
We're going in my voice is thin
When I tell you to remember
That no one will find you
My promise from the heart
If we part my pulse will guide you through

Be still for a moment
Everything depends upon you
If you die I will die too
Once we were heroes
But everything has changed since then
Now they recognize you too

I stay too long something's wrong
You walk out of the picture
I hold my breath and check the time
One thirty i collapse
We went in my voice was thin
When I told you to remember

I'm the evidence
You passed the test and that's so good for you
O love will you read the letters I will send to you
Will I come along
Will they let me out to take the test
O love is the score enough for me to pass the test",Evidence
Katatonia,"The thin darkness here
Not strong enough to make you appear
I once changed my style
When they said hello I said goodbye
I once played a role
I was out there marketing my soul

The city of glass that I live in
The coldness from my brothers skin

I trusted you you lied
It's all I hear a fucking lie
I don't give a shit it's over now
It's all I know you broke the vow

Truth is I have seen it come
Seen the ghost of the sun
Can't have it undone
In time we all call out for relief
See two lovers meet
Pass you on the street",Ghost of the Sun

All I had I lost in the flood
Come sit with me at the bar

Do you remember that I used to sing

Why have you waited so long

Come by you have come far
Long since I saw you so how have you been
Come sit with me at the bar
How long since they told you that they had found him
No one here knows my name
I gave up my worries for one good thing
But I remember you clearly
Do you remember that I used to sing

Was it because I never told you
I was going away
That you waited so long
Was it because your fucking dreams
Meant nothing to me
That you waited so long

Into my hands

The clash of light against the floor
They held me up against the wall

Where's my security
Behind my back it goes
Early morning's coming
The risk that I am taking
Recall a song that I heard as a child
No more false immunity
Inside the blistering cold

My youth unknown to me
I'm walking by a wire
What's left from me to breathe
Cold smell of fire
One day I will be free
I was born to be no one

I'm not set cannot do it yet

Hold me when I die

They walk round my door and speak of their coming
My trial awaits got nowhere to run
My only words how soon you have come

And I think about what you told me
When I was about to join in

Defy only if you have a way to resist the lies
Decline only if you have the intention of taking this advice
Apply only if you're not afraid to see your spirit die
Retreat only if you dare not hear yourself say goodbye

Who brought me here this place is familiar
Where houses are black under the sun
Strangers pass on streets with strange names

Guess I'm closing down torn and tired of my heart's sound
What's worth to me when life's not around
I will sleep tonight to sleep tomorrow if I sleep at last
A promise has been broken the essence of
Love in rust one in a million I'm the one turning pale
Any colors to express apart from bleak is hard
And where you are my thoughts are in guilt so forget me forget me not
Time to catch something since my ticket says the end
All my flowers withered today the room is quiet guess it's
Growing cold dead calm without my heart's sound what's worth
To you when I'm not around I will sleep tonight
To sleep tomorrow

My home away from home
In the state of New York I came of age

And the trees grow high in New York state
And they shine like gold in the autumn
Never had the blues from whence I came
But in New York state, I got 'em

Closing my eyes I hear the sea
Must I wait, must I follow
Won't you say come with me

And it's on to south bend, Indiana
Flat out on the western plain
Rise up over the rockies and down on into California
Out to where but the rocks again

And let the sun set on the ocean
I will watch it from the shore
Let the sun rise over the redwoods
I'll rise with it till I rise no more

In an Autumn wind
We met out in mid air
And fell together
In a patch of ground

With curly hair while mine was straight
And I was much to small

That gave my heart a fright
I dreamt that someone had come and taken you
From me

When I woke in the morning light
My dream had been wrong
And these words were like a sweet song
To me

""Mama, the small hand's at eight
Get up or I'll be late
Please fix me something sweet and good
To eat now

For that bell in the yard won't wait
And neither does time""

And night fades away

Kate & Anna McGarrigle,"Just a little atom of chlorine
Valence minus one
Swimming through the sea, digging the scene
Just having fun
She's not worried about the shape or size
Of her outside shell
It's fun to ionize
Just a little atom of cl
With an unfilled shell

But somewhere in that sea lurks
Handsome sodium
With enough electrons on his outside shell
Plus that extra one
Somewhere in this deep blue sea 
There's a negative
For my extra energy yes
Somewhere in this foam
My positive will find a home

Then unsuspecting chlorine
Felt a magnetic pull
She looked down and her outside
Shell was full
Sodium cried ""what a gas be my bride and
I'll change your name from chlorine to chloride""

Now the sea evaporates to make the clouds
For the rain and snow
Leaving her chemical compounds in the absence
Of H2O

Are happy ones

If I'd have known I would have said goodbye.

The time was in the telling on the bank the scene was set
The sky was rolling blindly on, the daylight had not gone
She washed her hair among the stones and saw what was to come
All this will pass
There will be blood among the corn and heroes in the hills
But there is more to come my boy before you've had your fill
Men will come and rape the soil as though it were their own
And they will bathe their feet in oil as I have bathed my own

All this will pass
All things must come
Just as I tell you here

Stones will stand together as if searching for the stars
And all come crashing down again before they reach too far
She turned to face the setting sun, I turned to walk away
But then she called my name again and beckoned me to stay

All this will pass
All things must come
Just as I tell you here

She told me of the famous sons who write their names in peace
Yet be cut down before the time has come for our release
Just as I tell you here
Even now I wait for the coming day
Even now she waits in the dawn
For the tales she tells, for the gifts that she will sell
For the sight she knows, for a vision that still grows
With the dream in her eyes no one's seen

I listened for so long that day that I can hardly tell
If what she said was heaven sent or brought to bear in hell
That men of hope would stand alone and still be cast a lie
Just as Romans cast them on the day they were to die

All this will pass
All things must come

And Autumn leaves are falling, 
I hear his voice on tumbling waves 
And no one there to hold me. 

At evening's fall he watched me walk. 
His heart was mine. 
But my love was young, and felt 
The world was not cruel, but kind. 

Where Lagan's light fell on the hour, 
I saw him far below me-- 
Just as the morning calmed the storm-- 
With no one there to hold him.

And nothing's left to warn me, 
Save for a voice on the traveling wind, 
And the glimpse of a face at morning.",My Lagan Love [*]

I'll never fall in love again.

I drift with Dunes,
I whisper of the tombs,
They offer me Egyptian Delights.

Got me in those Desert eyes,
Oh, I'm in love with Egypt.",Egypt

Big enough to let go of me?

Well I didn't know who were

There was a picture of you
A picture of you 'cross the front page
It looked just like you, just like you in every way
But it couldn't be true
It couldn't be true
You stepped out of a stranger

They say that the Devil is a charming man
And just like you I bet he can dance
And he is coming up behind in his long
Tailed black coat dance
All tails in the air
But the penny landed with its head dancing

A picture of you, a picture of you in uniform
Standing with your head held high
Hot down to the floor

In the mirror
He tells me that he is beautiful
So I look too, and what do I see? 
My eyes are full
But my face is empty

He's got a photo 
Of his hero
He keeps it under his pillow
But I've got a pin-up 
From a newspaper 
Of Peter Pan

I found it in a locket
I hide it in my pocket

Eventually you'll fall for her.
Down you'll go
To where the mellow wallows.

She'll touch you with your Mamma's hand.
You'll long to kiss those red lips,
But when you do
It'll feel like kicking a habit.

She'll tell you that she'll stay,
So you'd better barricade the way out.
She'll tell you she's true.
She'll tell you she loves you.

She prepares to go to bed.
She'll let you watch her undress,
Go places where
Your fingers long to linger.

He's got me where it hurts me.

I catch him when I'm bending.
Ooh, how he frightens me 
When they whisper privately.

Windy-wailey blows me.
Words of caress on their lips

Waiting for Then, when the lifespray cools

Laughing, loving
They know the way
To be happy

And I check my gunpowder pack
And I strap the stick on my back
And dressed as a rocket on Waterloo Bridge
Nobody seemed to see me
Then with the fuse in my hand
And now shooting into the night

And still as a rocket
I land in the river
Was it me said you were crazy?

I put on my cloudiest suit
Size five lightning boots too
'Cause I am a rocket
On fire

Do you think that they care if they're real, woman?
They just take it as part of the deal
Lost in your men and the games you play

Like it or not, we were built tough
Because we're woman

To live for, where it's hid inside
No, we never die for long

Inside of you can be two, woman

Plaiting her hair by the fire, woman
With no lover to free her desire
How long do you think she can stick it out?
How long do you think before she'll go out, woman?
Hey! Get up on your feet and go get it, now
Like it or not, we keep bouncing back,
Because we're woman

No, we never die for long,
While we've got that little life
To live for, where it's hid inside.

Kate Bush,"You'll find me in a Berlin bar, 
In a corner brooding. 
You know that I go very quiet 
When I'm listening to you. 

There's something very special indeed, 
In all the places where I've seen you shine, boy. 
There's something very real in how I feel, honey. 

[Chorus]
It's in me. 
It's in me, 
And you know it's for real. 
Tuning in on your saxophone. 

The candle burning over your shoulder is throwing 
Shadows on your saxophone, a surly lady in tremor. 
The stars that climb from her bowels, 
Those stars make towers on vowels. 

You'll never know that you had all of me. 
You'll never know the poetry you've stirred in me. 
Of all the stars I've seen that shine so brightly, 
I've never known or felt in myself so rightly,

Kate Bush,"I spent a lot of my time looking at blue, 
The color of my room and my mood: 
Blue on the walls, blue out of my mouth; 
The sort of blue between clouds, when the sun comes out, 
The sort of blue in those eyes you get hung up about. 

When that feeling of meaninglessness sets in, 
Go blowing my mind on God: 
The light in the dark, with the neon arms, 
The meek He seeks, the beast He calms, 
The head of the good soul department. 

I see myself suddenly 
On the piano, as a melody. 
My terrible fear of dying 
No longer plays with me, 
for now I know that I'm needed 
For the symphony. 

I associate love with red, 
The colour of my heart when she's dead; 
Red in my mind when the jealousy flies, 
Red in my eyes from emotional ties, 
Manipulation, the danger signs. 

The more I think about sex, the better it gets. 
Here we have a purpose in life: 
Good for the blood circulation, 
Good for releasing the tension, 
The root of our reincarnations.

Kate Bush,"Be-side of Sat In Your Lap single
Written by Donovan Leitch

I fell in love with a swan.
My eyes were filled with feathers,
He filled me with song,
In the reedy river,
In the reedy river.

I in my boat long hours,
He in his royal plumage--
I threw him some flowers,
In the reedy river,
In the reedy river.

Black was the night and starry.
I loosened off my garments
And let forth my hair,*
In the reedy river,
In the reedy river.

Sadly we mourned and sighed,
Whilst in evening twilight
Two swans glide and fly
In the reedy river,
In the reedy river,
(""Two swans glide and fly"")
In the reedy river.
(""Two swans glide and fly"")

I fell in love with a swan...

And I will surely die.""

Kate Bush,"Where is she 
When the little thing cries? 
She lies in a bed 
With a friend of mine. 
But some nights 
She'll run back in fright 
If she picks on a dick 
That's too big for her pride. 

Oh! Oh! 
Why did I ever go marry her? 
I was a child! 
I'm holding the baby, 
She's ran-tanning constantly. 
She saw me coming for miles. 
She saw me open wide. 

Four o'clock 
And the key's in the lock. 
And she's been on the wing 
And she's stinking of drink. 
Wakes the kid, 
So I put him to sleep, 
And she's in there all night, 
Doubled over the sink. 

Oh! Oh! 
Why did I ever go marry her?

Kate Bush,"It wouldn't take me long
To tell you how to find it
To tell you where we'll meet
This little girl inside me
Is retreating to her favourite place

Under the leaves, away from the party
Go right to the rose
Go right to the white rose
I sit here in the thunder
The green on the gray
I feel it all around me

It's not safe

Kate Bush,"Be-side to ""December Will Be Magic Again"" single
Written by Kate Bush

Warm and soothing,
That's how I remember home.
Walking into arms
Through the back door.
Hearing voices I know well,
And long for.

Cold and boozy,
Our holiday in the Alps.
Sitting in the lobby,
Mostly smoking.
Choking on the woozy afternoon.

I'm reeling in the music
And I've only had a few.
And I'm afraid
By the way we grow old,
My darling.

Abrupt, too moody,
You making our party list.
I remember sulking
On the sofa.
For most of the winter
We were strangers.

Just one more
To ease the ache,
Before the night takes me.
When you stay asleep
On your side of the bed,
Don't look at me,
Don't look at you...

I'm reeling in the music
And I've only had a few.
And I'm afraid
By the way we grow old,

She's losing that inner flame.
It was burning bright,
But she's losing the light fast.

She's only herself to blame.
Well, take care of yourself,
And remember Georgie.
But she's so O.D.'d on weeping
She can hardly see

That she's dropping beads.

Dropping beads.

Feel your feet start kissing the ground
Feel your arms are opening out
And see your eyes are lifted to God

Kate Bush,"Only you can do something about it
There's no-one there, my friend, any better
I might know what you mean when you say you fall apart
Aren't we all the same? In and out of doubt
I can see angels standing around you
They shimmer like mirrors in Summer
But you don't know it
And they will carry you o'er the walls

If you need us, just call
Rest your weary world in their hands
Lay your broken laugh at their feet
I can see angels around you
They shimmer like mirrors in Summer
There's someone who's loved you forever but you don't know it
You might feel it and just not show it",Among Angels
Kate Bush,"Lake Tahoe.
Cold mountain water. Don't ever swim there.
Just stand on the edge and look in there.
And you might see a woman down there.

They say some days, up she comes, up she rises, as if out of nowhere.
Wearing Victorian dress.
She was calling her pet, ""Snowflake! Snowflake!""
Tumbling like a cloud that has drowned in the lake.

Just like a poor, porcelain doll...
Her eyes are open but no-one's home.
The clock has stopped.
So long she's gone.

No-one's home.
Her old dog is sleeping.
His legs are frail now.
But when he dreams,

He runs...
Along long beaches and sticky fields.
Through the Spooky Wood looking for her.
The beds are made. The table is laid.

The door is open - someone is calling: It's a woman.
""Here boy, here boy! You've come home!
I've got an old bone and a biscuit and so much love.
Miss me? Did you miss me?

Here's the kitchen - There's your basket.
Here's the hall - That's where you wait for me.
Here's the bedroom - You're not allowed in there.
Here's my lap - That's where you lay your head.

Here boy, oh you're a good boy.
You've come home.
You've come home.""",Lake Tahoe
Kate Bush,"Roll his body.
Give him eyes.
Make him smile for me,
Give him life.

My hand is bleeding, I run back inside.
I turn off the light,
Switch on a starry night.
My window flies open.

My bedroom fills with falling snow,
Should be a dream but I'm not sleepy.
I see his snowy white face but I'm not afraid.
He lies down beside me.

So cold next to me.
I can feel him melting in my hand.
Melting, in my hand.
He won't speak to me.

His crooked mouth is full of dead leaves.
Full of dead leaves, bits of twisted branches and frozen garden,
crushed and stolen grasses from slumbering lawn.
He is dissolving, dissolving before me and dawn will come soon.

What kind of spirit is this?
Our one and only tryst.
His breath all misty,
And when I kiss his ice-cream lips

And his creamy skin,
His snowy white arms surround me.
So cold next to me.
I can feel him melting in my hand.

Melting, melting, in my hand.
Sunday morning.
I can't find him.
The sheets are soaking

And on my pillow:
Dead leaves, bits of twisted branches and frozen garden,
crushed and stolen grasses from slumbering lawn.
I can't find him - Misty

Oh please can you help me?
He must be somewhere.
Open window closing,
Oh but wait, it's still snowing.

If you're out there,
I'm coming out on the ledge.
I'm going out on the ledge.",Misty
Kate Bush,"Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you but don't I know you?
There's just something about you. Haven't we met before?
We've been in love forever.
When we got to the top of the hill we saw Rome burning.

I just let you walk away. I've never forgiven myself.
I saw you on the steps in Paris, you were with someone else.
Couldn't you see that should've been me? I just walked on by.
Then we met in '42 but we were on different sides.

I hid you under my bed but they took you away.
I lost you in a London smog as you crossed the lane.
I never know where you're gonna be next but I know that you'll surprise me.
Come with me, I'll find some rope and I'll tie us together.

I've been waiting for you so long, I don't want to lose you again.
Don't walk into the crowd again. Don't walk away again.
I don't want to lose you.
I don't want to lose you.

I don't want to lose you again.
There's just something about you.
Have we been in love forever?
9.11 in New York, I took your photograph.

I still have your smiling face
In a heart-shaped frame.
Snowed in at Wheeler street, just two old flames keeping the fire going.
We look so good together.

Can't we just stay there forever? We were so happy.
I'd live that day over and over but the world won't stop turning.
When we got to the top of the hill we saw Rome burning.
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose you again.

Don't walk away again. Don't leave me lost again.
I don't want to lose you.
I don't want to lose you.
I don't want to lose you again.

I don't want to lose you.
I don't want to lose you.
I don't want to lose you again.
Oh no, not again!

Now I am falling.
I want you to catch me.
Look up and you'll see me.

You know you can hear me.
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.
We're over a forest.
There's millions of snowflakes.

We're dancing.
The world is so loud. Keep falling and I'll find you.
I am ice and dust. I am sky.
I can see horses wading through snowdrifts.

My broken hearts, my fabulous dances.
My fleeting song, fleeting.
The world is so loud. Keep falling. I'll find you.

My fleeting song.
My twist and shout.
I am ice and dust and light. I am sky and here.

Kate Bush,"They call you an animal, the Kangchenjunga Demon, Wild Man, Metoh-Kangmi.
Lying in my tent, I can hear your cry echoing round the mountainside.
You sound lonely.
While crossing the Lhakpa-La something jumped down from the rocks.
In the remote Garo Hills by Dipu Marak we found footprints in the snow.

The schoolmaster of Darjeeling said he saw you by the Tengboche Monastery.
You were playing in the snow. You were banging on the doors. 
You got up on the roof, Roof of the World.
You were pulling up the rhodedendrons. Loping down the mountain.
They want to know you. They will hunt you down, then they will kill you.
Run away, run away, run away
While crossing the Lhakpa-La something jumped down from the rocks.
In the remote Garo Hills by Dipu Marak we found footprints in the snow.
We found your footprints in the snow. We brushed them all away...
From the Sherpas of Annapurna to the Rinpoche of Qinghai.
Shepherds from Mount Kailash to Himachal Pradesh found footprints in the snow.

You’re not a langur monkey nor a big brown bear – You’re the Wild Man.
They say they saw you drowned near the Rongbuk Glacier.
They want to hunt you down. You’re not an animal.

Kate Campbell,"Huey was a captain with Andy Jackson
He settled in Kentucky on a soldier's pay
It was two hundred acres and for almost as many years
The land has borne my family name

You can count the generations
Like circles in a tree
On tombstones you can barely read

Will you walk with me across the blue green pastures?
I wanna see horses run one more time
You can lay me down beside the ones gone before me
Bury me in bluegrass when I die

Uncle Henry sells computers, he never learned to farm
So he sold his part to daddy when grandpa died
And Mom and Dad are old now, they say they're gonna move
Where the weather is always warm and dry

The buyers signed the note today
They're gonna build a mall
With plans to break ground before the fall

Will you walk with me through the fields of Burley?
I wanna see leaves of gold one more time
You can lay me down beside the ones gone before me
Bury me in bluegrass when I die

They nailed the sign up yesterday
And I don't understand
To me it's more than just a piece of land

Will you walk with me through the peaceful valley?
I wanna see the harvest moon one more time
You can lay me down beside the ones gone before me
Bury me in Bluegrass when I die

Reaches out to touch
And only sees
Pretty powder puffs
Down the road
A black child plays
But the dreams he holds lie
A cotton field away

A window breaks
Another one dies
A momma's heart aches
Behind locked doors
A white man prays
And thanks the Lord he lives

Beyond the clouds
We both might be

For lonely hearts without a friend

Was not good enough for Sunday's best
They said she was different, not like us
So they showed her the way to the bus

Oh, I knew a man who had a dream
To take the truth and set men free
But no one listened, no one saw

A light of focus when I could not see
Now I want you to know, if there comes a need
You can count on me

You can fall like the rain and I will be a river
Winding forever, strong and true
I'll carry you away to the peaceful water
And lanterns on the levee will shine for you

There are storms on the horizon that you won't even see
Until the cold relentless winds appear

Runnin' 'cross the plains
It felt like an earthquake
When I first saw your face

You were standin' like a rock
And suddenly I knew
From that moment on
I belonged to you

Like the sound of distant thunder
Your heart beats next to mine
With love strong enough to stand the test of time
And I will follow you no matter where you roam
I like a man, like a buffalo
I like a man, like a buffalo

Where have all the real men gone?
Did we run 'em off?
In searching for a better way
Did we just get lost?

When I look around these days
I thank the Lord for you
You're a field of open range
And I'm the sky of blue

Like the sound of distant thunder
Your heart beats next to mine
With love strong enough to stand the test of time

Put all he had into the land
They came from nowhere on a cold dark wind
The harvest disappeared
But he survived the locust years

It hurt to hear her baby cry
Worked two jobs to get by
Convinced herself she never needed a man
Holding back the tears
She survived the locust years

When I lay next to you in your arms
I know the world can do us no harm
And like the thorns protect the rose
I am safe with you

I know a place inside a dream
Where rivers run through fields of green
A quiet valley that never lives in fear
I will meet you there
If we survive the locust years

No map to show me where to go
Give me one change of clothes and a box of Oreos
And endless miles of open road

I'm going south of everything
Where the air is sweet and church bells ring
Back where I come from, back where I belong
Down where the sun shines in the rain
And life goes by from a front porch swing
You can keep the bitter cold
I'm gonna go south of everything

Why is everyone in such a hurry?
No one ever wins a rat race
And they wonder why so many go crazy
I gotta get out of this place

When I hear someone ask how I'm doing
Or see a stranger wave behind the wheel
Then I'll know I'm headed in the right direction
By the peaceful way I feel

And now, it's just an old hotel people come to see
If I could buy a ticket I'd be in his arms once more

Back when good times were really good

And every night they would run

Designing toilets for the space program
He believed if we could go to the moon
There's nothing on earth a man can't do

So he ordered a ton of sand and clay
In his front yard he built a frame
Most folks said it'll never float
Still they came to see Bud's cement boat

A dream is anything that you want it to be
For some it's fame and fortune but for others concrete
Sometimes you just gotta follow your heart
No matter where it leads

He gave up fishing and most of his friends
Worked all night and every weekend
But he didn't mind the sacrifice
'Cause he'd build a boat that's one of a kind

Well, the neighbors thought it was a real eyesore
They'd say hey Bud what are ya building that for
And knowing they would never understand
He'd just smile and say because I can

Well, he got laid off in seventy-four
And they don't go to the moon anymore
But down around the Alabama coast
She still floats Bud's Sea-Mint boat

",Bud's Sea-Mint Boat
Kate Campbell,"Once every May Day
We stayed at her house
With doilies on tables
And cats on the couch

She played me records
The ones he adored
The music they danced to
Before the war

And now sometimes I see her
And she seems so lonely
Standing there
In my moonpie dreams

He wagged his tail
When Jim let him in
He came from the next block
And they were best friends

He'd bring the paper
Without a tear
He knew his friend Jim
Would always be there

Now he waits at the back door
But it's just him only
Sitting there
In my moonpie dreams

Now I look out my window
And wish you could hold me

In an old Winn Dixie sack
She pulled her Firebird out of the driveway
Without ever looking back

By the time she got to Georgia
It was nearly half past eight
She bought a ninety-nine cent breakfast
At the Stuckey's by the interstate

And she don't know where she's going
And she's really not sure why
But she's got to try and find a way
To live before she dies

She might see Rock City
She might see Ruby Falls
She might change her name to Marilyn
And drop her southern drawl

She wants to climb Lookout Mountain
And see all seven states
She wants to feel the wind through her hair again
Before it gets too late to see Rock City

Well, she stopped in Chattanooga
And called her mama's beauty shop
She said I won't be home for supper
Give my love to Bo and Pop

And her mama knew the reasons
Without even asking why

To live before she dies

And made a lot people mad
They planned to bus us off across town
And things got really bad

That's when the private schools were started
And they opened in a rush

You'll be riding bus

109 bus, 109 bus
You'll be fine

I met Lavonna Jones in gym class
She said my hair had no curl
We played basketball together
But came from different worlds

Lavonna lived down in the projects
Compared to her I had so much

But in your arms, it's a perfect world

When your love wraps around me tight
I believe in paradise
There's one place where my heart's secure

Kate Campbell,"I can still recall the night
Lightning burned the mansion down
We all stood in out pajamas
On that hallowed southern ground

When the flames had turned to ashes
Only blackened bricks remained
And sixteen stately Doric columns
There beneath a veil of gray

And it's a long and slow surrender
Retreating from the past
It's important to remember
To fly the flag half-mast
And look away

I was taught by elders wiser
Love your neighbor, love your God
Never saw a cross on fire
Never saw an angry mob

I saw sweet magnolia blossoms
I chased lightening bugs at night
Never dreaming others saw our way of life
In black and white

Part of me hears voices crying
Part of me can feel their weight
Part of me believes that mansion
Stood for something more than hate

",Look Away
Kate Campbell,"Como estas?
My name is Rosa and like my mother before me
Everyday I roll cigars and they're the finest in the world
To pass the time the reader reads about the violence in America
And I pray for my daughter and her baby girl

Late one night they took a boat ninety miles from Havana
To escape the only life I've ever known
She could have been just like me, a well-respected working woman
Who believes in her country and her home

And I wonder as I roll where will each one go
Will they land in the hands of kings and presidents
It's an art, it's a skill, and some would even kill
Just for one of Rosa's coronas

It's everywhere in the news that John Paul is on his way
And for years I've longed to see the Holy Father's parade
We've been told not to go or production falls behind
But I know the quota won't be made that day

And I know it's calling me to go
Where the Spanish moss drapes the trees
And the bayou whispers to let it be

Come on, let's go down the road to Rosaryville
Who knows what we will find
We won't need much on the road to Rosaryville
We can leave the world behind

It's not easy marching out of time
When other voices tell you stay in line
Some will say it's only wasted dreams
But they've never tasted wine so sweet

Follow your heart with me we'll take a ride

Kate Campbell,"I want to tell you all a story bout the Harper Valley widow wife
Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper Valley's Junior High
Well her daughter come home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said mom I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA

Well the note said Mrs Johnson you're wearin' your dresses way too high
And it's reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be a bringin' up your little girl this way
Yeah it was signed by the secretary Harper Valley PTA

Well it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon
And they were sure surprised when Mrs Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard I can still recall the words she had to say
She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA

Well now there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice whenever he's away
And Mr Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down
Mr Harper couldn't be here cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
Well when you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Payton Place and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites
No I wouldn't put you on because it really did it happened just this way
The day my mama socket it to the Harper Valley PTA
Yeah my mama socket it to the Harper Valley PTA

Kate Ceberano,"So you're feeling hungry and haunted
Brother, you gotta stop letting this get you down
Don't forget to be king even when your queen ain't around
So what started out good has turned sour
Well the world won't stand still if you change your mind
You don't have to be pretend any more to protect someone else
Oh, don't come around
Don't come around with your sad ideas and those big old eyes
You better find your sense of humour or you're going to lose her
Ohh no don't come around
You get caught up in insignificances
And the littlest thing can become a scene
Receiving abuse on street corners never used to be your thing
Well you err on the side of protection
Always feeling the pain for somebody else
But when there's no respect for the love that you give that's a crime
Ohh no don't come around
Don't come around with your sad ideas and those big old eyes
You better find your sense of humour or you gonna lose her

Kate Ceberano,"It feels so good when love is a conscious thing
Less pretentious and real baby,
Do you feel like I do?
I know its vague by definition, but whether real or just imagined
Honey right now I don't care

So if I change I'll give you a warning
Until that time then just be adoring
Love is alive, and we look alike
Are we dressed alright, well go out tonight
Sleep all day and well eat in bed
Well make love until this mood is spent

So kick your boots off and leave them by the door
You wont be needing them anymore
I know you feel like I feel
Cause I can fake it or lose it completely
Whenever your lying beside me
The world outside can go to hell

So if I change I'll give you a warning
Until that time then just be adoring
Love is alive, and we look alike
Are we dressed alright, well go out tonight
Sleep all day and well eat in bed
Well make love until this mood is spent

And it gets so creepy trying to justify
One night stands are just too freaky, too bizarre
Scattered clothes and a telephone number tattooed to your palm
And in the morning you wake up too alone, feeling guilty

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely

Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more

I think I love her

Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't to bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store

And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more

And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star

Listen
They say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya
If I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

With my headphones loud
So my hips can swing, so my head can nod
To the rock and roll to the boom boom beat

And the music within makes me whole

And I sing songs back to back until I go to bed

There's a river in my mind that's never still
Swirling, soothing all the time gives me a thrill
Swimming in the notes that go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Wandering, waking in an empty wood
It is quiet here, I am powerful
I look down below serenade the world
From inside my soul

And  I find that I'm never alone
And  I find that my heart is my home
And  the music within makes me whole

Of all the world says you will never be
That's when you can't give up

Gotta hold on tighter now that ever
The answers will find you when you believe
And I feel it's light
Now I found the spark
That was missin in my life

I earned these wings
I was not born with them
& it's no accident
How I walked through
The rain and the fire

'Cause it taught me how to love
It taught me how to fight
& finally I'm learning to fly

And I tried yea I tried to get somewhere that I'd rather be
But sometimes the fastest way is not so easy

I earned these wings
I was not born with them

Kate Fenner,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

And I'm always hungover when someone wants to talk 
And don't get me wrong, I like talking 
When it's a healthy back-and-forth exchange 
But some people always wanna lecture me 
And try to make me change 
He says 'You are a mystery, aren't you' 
And considering he hasn't shut up long enough for me to string two words together 
Yes that's me, Miss Mystery 
And he's quiet for a time 
And I think that might be a good sign 
Til there's a glint in his eye and I realize 
He's just making more sentences in his mind 
And here it comes, and there's nothing I can do 
I take a sip, I take a breath 
He licks his lips and he's opening his mouth, and it's:

Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 
Blah blah dog diggity blah

Like a steam train 
Like an onslaught 
Like a machine gun loaded with your opinions 
But it's incoherent ammunition 
And your words aren't very wounding weapons 
When they're inflicted on me 
And I know you mean well 
With your deep wells of advice 
And your buckets of swelled self-righteousness 
Hell, you're just trying to be nice 
And you're nice, but you state your views like they are facts of life 
And I hate that, and I tell you 
And I brace myself for the reply, it's gonna be

Of pressing topics of discussion 
Competing with the clanking coffee cup percussion 
And I guess we'll start with number one

And the pouring of the lattes 
And here it comes, it's coming and there's nothing anyone can do

Kate Miller-Heidke,"I'm thinking of when I first touched you 
Your skin was electric 
Now I'm far too wise to dwell on such things 
And far too sentimental to forget them 
I read somewhere memories are stories you write for yourself 
To explain who you are, and how you got there 
And to blame it on somebody else 

Now the gifts are open 
The toys are broken 
The speeches are all spoken 
And the dishes cleared away 
The stream keeps flowing 
My doubts are growing 
'Cause I've got no way of knowing 
If it'll be damned or reach the sea 
For you and me

I met a man twice my age 
Half joking, he said ""I should warn you. 
You're a fish on the line, 
And the lines pulling in, 
And there's a frying pan coming to warm you""
And while I smiled, it occurred to me 
I'm just gristle and blood 
And I've spent half my life with the sun in my eyes 
Chasing rainbows through the mud

When I was a child in a little kid's world 
My heart was the same as the one I have now 
But it amazes me how much everything else has changed",Day After Christmas

Like a telegram.
Said ""I don't know where I am, or how I got here. I don't have a stamp.""
I hadn't seen you for a while,
You look just like your picture only deeper,
And your smile was shyer and your shirt 
Was a bit less ironed.
I don't believe in fate instead I couldn't help thinking
Someone must have noticed you,
And folded you up nice and even

And sent you 
And sent you 
And sent you 
To me.

So don't apologize,
Just bring your suitcases inside.
Come on, come in,
You don't have to say anything.
Hello, get out of the rain,
Here we go again.

Hello

The truth is, you are an angel
Most of the time I don't feel too guilty,
So when you look at me and I can see my dirty shadow
On your halo glow.
But I wanna keep things simple,
No complications,
No late nights and no empty rain stations.
Remember last time?
We don't want it like that 

This time around 
This time around
This time around

Just bring your suitcases inside.
Come on, come in,
You don't have to do anything.

If we could keep time, when could we use it.

God was everywhere then
A person had a soul

And this was all there was
And it was enough
The world could never come between us
The sky, the horizon, the trees
We had enough 

Everyone could play with the little kids
Even if they had none of their own
No one had to pay, the world belonged to everyone

The men had tons of muscles
From working out of doors
They didn't have doors then
So they didn't have to lock them

And this was all there was
And it was enough
The world could never come between us
The sky, the horizon, the trees
We had enough

Kate Miller-Heidke,"She's plugged into headphones
Crouched in the corner of her one bedroom flat
Her clothes for the next day hang in the hallway
Over the welcome mat
She sees her own reflection
Looking back from a blank TV screen
She stares for a while and then she mimes the words

And on those days when she is looking around her
She's so amazed by the things that she sees
But most days she only sees herself

Upstairs behind another locked door
He's watching a movie that he's seen before
Phone's off the hook, the curtains are drawn
The benches are clean and the dishwasher's on
He sees his own reflection in a frame on the wall that's catching the light
He hadn't realized that he looked so tired 

And on those days when he is looking around him
He's so amazed by the things that he sees
But most days he only sees himself

Next morning they pass in the hall
Both of them stare straight at the floor
All they hear is the sound of their shoes
As they climb in their cars to the radio news
They're stuck in traffic now
At opposite ends of the very same street
And just like everyone else
Driving with 4 spare seats

And if today they were looking around them
They'd be amazed by the things that they'd see
They don't even see themselves",Four Spare Seats

Blocking the sun like an ocean liner,
When I discover I'm living in your shadow,

I'm spinning round the lamp-post in the rain
Way up here, I remember the rain,
And I'm whispering directly in your ear.

You are perfecting circular breathing,
I can't always tell when you're inhaling.
So you make it look like you're always giving,
But you're always storing little bits away,
You're a bit away.

Way up here, it's pouring down,

By the force of my love?
You take my breath away,

Where I end and you begin, break

And out and in, and doubt and din again.

We let out a little bit of ourselves,
It'd be alright if we could exchange.
But you don't want to,
And I don't blame you,
But I'm gonna wanna learn to play the didgeridoo, too.

Hm, because, way up here,
I'm spinning round that lamp-post in the rain

We walked through the Japanese Gardens Home
You tried to impress me by rolling a smoke
But your hands were shaking and the paper broke
I played cool and I took a drag
Coughed like the kid on the Panadol ad
You just smiled and kicked the dirt
Said, ""We're not as cool as we thought we were""

On the night that we first kissed
I climbed out the window so I wouldn't be missed
Getting too big for the swings in the park
Passing the lighter in the dark
As the sun came up we had to leave
You said my name, I could feel you breathe
I walked home in the freezing cold
Heartbeat thumping through my coat

Fire and iron
Iron and fire
Tears in the water
Water in the wine

That awkward winter turned to spring
We learned a million grown-up things
Sharing cigarettes under the stars
We laughed and drank and raced your car
Then one morning, right on dawn
You the lost the wheel, you missed the turn
The whole world rolled on top of us
You said my name, but I never woke up again

Let it go, let it go
Where's the guy I used to know?
The girl I was died years ago, now she's a ghost

To hold beside me while I sleep

I remember everything you said
That night inside our tent by the torchlight
Do you remember how I made you laugh?
You said, ‘I hope I die before you’
I remember walking through a forest
You said that you thought we might be dreaming
Then we made it to the top of a waterfall
And we jumped down hand-in-hand and screaming

I could travel down the path that never ends

But I don’t want to be your memory

Yours was the body that rhymed with my body
And I just don’t think there will ever be anybody else
Yours was the body that fit mine completely
And I fail to see how there could ever be anybody else

Kate Nash,"Thursday night,
Everything's fine,
Except you've got that look in your eyes,
When I'm telling a story
And you find it boring your thinking of something to say
You'll go along with and then drop it
And you Humiliate me, in front of our friends

Then I'll use that voice what you find annoyin'
And say something like
""Intelligent input darlin' why don't you just have another beer then?""

Then you call me a bitch and everyone we're with will be embarrassed,
And I won't give a shit

My fingertips are holding onto the
Cracks in our foundations,
And I know that I should let go,
But I can't
And every time we fight I know its not right,
Every time that your upset and I smile
I know I should forget, but I can't

You said I must eat so many lemons,
Cause I am so bitter
I said ""I'd rather be with your friends mate,
Cause they are much fitter""

Yes it was childish
And you got aggressive
And I must admit that I was a bit scared,
But it gives me thrills to wind you up

My fingertips are holding onto the
Cracks in our foundations,
And I know that I should let go,

But I can't
And every time we fight,
I know its not right,
Every time that your upset and I smile,
I know I should forget,
But I can't

Your face is pasty,
Cause you've gone and got so wasted,
What a surprise,
Don't want to look at your face,
Cause its making me sick

You've gone and got sick on my trainers,
I only got these Yesterday
Oh my gosh, I cannot be bothered with this

Well I'll leave you there till the mornin',
And I purposely wont turn the heating on
And dear God, I hope I'm not stuck with this one

My fingertips are holding onto the
Cracks in our foundations,
And I know that I should let go,
But I can't
And every time we fight,
I know its not right,
Every time that your upset and I smile,
I know I should forget,
But I can't

And every time we fight I know it's not right,
Every time that you're upset and I smile
I know I should forget, but I can't

Ain't good enough for me
But asking for your telephone number
Seems highly inappropriate

Seeing as I can't, you don't say hi and you walk by
And that time you shook my hand, it felt so nice
I swear I've never felt this way about any other guy
And I don't usually notice people's eyes but

I conducted a plan to bump into you most accidentally
But I was walking along and I bumped into you
Much more heavily than I'd originally planned
It was well embarrassing
And I think you thought that I was a bit of a twat

I just think that we'd get on
Oh, I wish I could tell you face to face
Instead of singing this stupid song
But yeah, I just think that we might get on

So, I went to that party
Everyone, they're kind of arty
And I was wearing this dress
'Cause I wanted to impress
But I wasn't sure if I looked my best
'Cause I was so nervous

But I carried on regardless
Strutting through each room trying to find you
And when I saw you kissing that girl
My heart, it shattered and my eyes, they watered
And when I tried to speak, I stuttered

And my friends were like, ""Whatever
You'll find someone better
His eyes are way to close together
And we never even liked him from the start
And now he's with that tart
And I heard she done some really nasty stuff
Down in the park with Michael""

""He said she's easy
And if your guy's with someone that's sleazy
Then he ain't worth your time
'Cause you deserve a real nice guy""
So, I proceeded to get drunk and to cry
Locked myself in the toilets for the entire night

Saturday night, I watched Channel 5
I particularly liked CSI
I don't ever dream about you and me
I don't ever make up stuff about us
That would because that's insanity

I don't ever drive by your house
To see if you're in
I don't even have an opinion
On that tramp that you are still seeing

I don't know your timetable
I don't know your face of by heart

That we could get on, that we should get on",We Get On

But I think that she's not so nice

Every guy's looking in her eyes
Every guy's checking out her thighs
Everyone thinks that girl's a lady
But I don't, I think that girl's shady.

But I'll just read a book instead
Well I know that you think she's first
I don't even think she cares
Don't know what you see

There's nothing that
(Ba bom ba bom ba bom bom)

Well I think she's a bitch",Do-Wah-Doo
Kate Nash,"BBQ food is good
You invite me out to eat it, I should
Go, but I'm feeling kind of nervous
And not quite myself
So I'm running late on purpose
And I know this won't help
How things have become between us
But if I go you'll give me hell
And that I don't know how to fix it
Is making me unwell, well
I arrive at your house
But you've just got up
And you are wearing a towel
And your eyes look dark
I help to dry your body
And I see your cut
So I give you a plaster
And we cover it up
I say ""Have you been crying?""
And you say ""Shut Up""
So we sit in the garden
And touch the grass
With our hands

The sun is going down now
And it's been okay
You tell me all these things you did
While I was away
And this worries me somewhat

You say you're fine
Listen
Can you hear it?
Does it speak?
Will I feel it?
Will it hurt?
Am I near it?
I don't know

I don't know how more people haven't got mental health problems
Thinking is one of those stressful things I've ever come across
And not being able to articulate what I want to say drives me crazy
I think I should try and read more books
And learn some new words
My sister used to read the dictionary
I'm going to start with that
I'd like to travel
I want to see India and the pyramids
A whale and that race with all the bicycles in France
I'm not sure about rivers, they scare me
But I love swimming, I'm good at it
And when I swim I think about numbers
And count the laps
When I was younger I saw a house burnt down
And I walked past it everyday for the next six years
Derelict, black, chalky and dangerous
I wondered if squatters lived there
I'm still not sure but I know there were never any parties cause it was shit
After a while the council got round to tidying out the town
Making it less offensive here and there
They said it was an eyesore so they let tore it down
Behind the house was a wall with a few bits of crappy graffiti
and the word 'Cunt' written on it in giant letters
And now I walk past that

I like sitting in the park
And I like walking through it
I like taking my dogs there
And friends, and I like being alone
I like flowers and simplicity
I like compassion and thoughtful gifts
I like being able to shout
But I wish I could be quiet
When I'm quiet people think I'm sad
And usually I am

Sometimes when I'm at a busy train station
Somewhere big with the noisy trains like King's Cross
I feel like putting down my bags and shouting things out
because I've got something to say
Don't you want to share the guilt?
Don't think, just try and sleep",Don't You Want to Share the Guilt?
Kate Nash,"How could you let her touch you 
In a place you didn't want touched 
How could you let her get so close to you 
That she could kiss your neck 
And kiss it gently 
And kiss it gently 
And kiss it gently 

How could you take her number from her 
When you met her in that bar 
How could you offer her a drink 
And then the front seat of your car 
And kiss her gently 
And kiss her gently 
And kiss her hard 

How could you lie to me right to my face? 
How could your best friend's ex-girlfriend's 
Younger sister's mate, know before I did? 
Before I did 
Before I did 

How could you string me along for so long 
For just over eleven months 
How could I be so stupid and sublime 
You know I think I had a hunch 
About this anyway 
About this whole thing 
About this girl 

I thought that it was just a phase 
You were so distant and so cold 
I thought that it was just your age 
And the fear of getting old 
You acted different 
You were so different 
You were impatient 

And you lied to me right to my face 
And your best friend's ex-girlfriend's 
Younger sister's mate, knew before I did 
Before I did 
Before I did 

'Cause if you run into the eye of the storm 
To get round the back 
You better hit the floor

No, I can't take it 
I can't take it

'Til your eyes and your mouth is sore

Doesn't do anything 
But you'd do something else 
If you only could 

And I wish I could grow up 
Wish I could be well behaved 
But every time I look him in the eye 
I send him to the grave 
And that pretty, pretty girl 
With her nice neat lips 
With your eyes on her chest 
And your hands on her hips 

This itch, this burn 
This pain, this strain 
Dealing, turned out 
That we don't need to 
Help it go away 
So that's what 
Leaving me 
The gift you gave him 

I can't take it 
I can't take it 
I can't take it anymore 
I can't take it anymore

I like cream-teas 

And I like reading, ghost-stories 
And my heart skips a beat every time that we meet 
It's been a while and now your smile is almost like a memory 
But then you're back and I am fine 'cause you're with me 
And I'm in love with you

Kate Nash,"I fancy the hip rock 'n' roll sinister 
I wanna be fucked and then rolled over 
Cause I'm an independent woman of the 21st century 
No time for knits, I want sex and debauchery 
I read glamor and the guardian 

I like flowers & I'm hardy & I take cocaine 
I don't give a fuck about her I want your name 
I can get fucked like the best of men 
Like the best of men Like the worst of pain 
Inflicted on another young girl again 
Impressed by another guitar hero 
He's a top score & you're a zero 
You're out of your league 

There ain't no rubber on the tracks it's gravel 
You fall hard, cut quick and it's an STD, a cut knee 
You're a side of stage grasp, a laugh 
An after show party in a bath 

Fucked and expected to be fucked 
A gasp from an uninformed intruder 
The crowd go wild and things get ruder 

They're already out of hand and there's no-one here 
To take your hand. It's a cold shower and a scramble 
For a dirty pair of knicker, don't get yours mixed up with hers 
Now get out of bed, get out of bed, get out get out get get out of bed 

Get up, get down & get undressed! Cause that's what you 
Do best, strip, strip strip n shag, fuck get fucked 'n drag, 
And be impressed, by the better sex, take a piece of raw 
Vegetable and hold it to your breast and say you stood 
For nothing. You were just a hole that lacked passion, 
Another undignified product of society. That girl 
Should have been a mansion.",Mansion Song
Kate Nash,"You've come so far, well done darling
We knew that you had it in you
You can do anything that you want, world is an oyster, don't disappoint us
You can stand on your own two feet, you can lead me through the streets
Pave the way, so we can dream dreams, no one else can see what you made me see
Still climbing trees, tripping up over fallen leaves, but holding hands
No one else could ever understand what it's like between us

And that's between us, but I know that

You'll never listen to me, no you'll never listen to me
No you'll never listen to me, no you'll never listen to me

Kate Nash,"Picked you out my pocket, and you fell into the road
You asked me if I'd make it better
Asked me if we could grow old together
But you don't mean a thing to me
So I'll walk by quite happily
And now I guess that you've moved on as well

You took me to the bricks
You start to build a wall
Keep peace intact
Protect your family
Keep them from harm
Live peacefully, but they came crumbling down
The second you left town,
And now your family are gone, are gone

Understand me, take me, fully
Underground where I can not be found
Understand me, take me, fully
Underground where I can not be found

And a letter that you wrote
That had been stashed inside my wall
Telling me all about your life
It had been there for a quite a while
It skipped out certain chapters
That I thought had really mattered
And now I feel like I missed out

Out, baby out, get out of town
Baby out, baby out, get out
Baby out, baby out, get out of town
Before it catches up with you
And you cannot withstand
Before it catches up with you
And you cannot withstand
Before it catches up with you
And you cannot withstand",Pickpocket

Kate Nash,"How did it get to 3 am?
I wish that I could call
But I know that you’re probably asleep
Do I really have to get used
To being alone again?
I wish that I could call
But I know that you are my best friend
Do you really have to dream?
I’m perfectly happy 
In reality I’m wide awake
I think about the things
That I will do tomorrow and the trek 
Things are dark outside and everybody else is fast asleep
My hand is glued to the remote
The TV has already said
‘Tonight I’m frozen in my sleep’
I want to move but I’m afraid

I don’t want to be alone!

The way you pull me in so tight
It makes me sick but then we’d fight
But I want you so bad tonight
You are the one I think of
All the night
And all the night it feels so right

It makes me sick but then we’d fight
But I want you so bad tonight

I want to change my future one
My desire change my room
Passions are trivially spent
Obviously it hurts me to believe
And in my fatal judgement
Cut off my electricity
And now I’m really stuffed
I’ll make an effort, take a left
Clean the house to stop me crying
And if you cry, you’re taken out
There won’t be room for Miss Sincere
I’m afraid this is all or nothing
And I haven’t got a hope
At least I’ve got another friend
Turns out I was just a joke
I’m holding onto what I’ve got
I’m tryna get just what I want
And I’ll pick the pieces up tomorrow
Cut the pill and take my chances and a half
Yeah baby

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?

Kate Power,"If I were free  what I would do 
I'd run and lock myself away with you 
And turn a ring  into a key              
Oh  I know that's what I'd do 
If I were free     
If I were strong  I would be so mild 
I would be strong enough to love you like a child 
I would turn a cry  into a song   
Oh  I know that's what I would do 
If I were strong 
If I were wise  then I would see 
What makes you love a foolish man like me          
I'd stand by you  just like a tree 
Oh I know that's what I would do 
I would chain myself to you 
I would never leave this room if I were free 
A line of birds across the sun 
Darling it's my fate to follow on the run 
But girl this running is not for me 
I would never run again if I were free
And here's just what I'd do 
I would chain myself to you 
I would never leave this room if I was free",If I Were Free
Kate Power,"Tell me,
Just one more time the reasons why you must leave,
Tell me once more why you're sure you don't need me,
Tell me again but, don't think that you'll convince me.

Now you've said,
Before falling in love again you'd rather be dead,
'Cause when someone breaks your heart, you cry your eyes red,
But there's nothing so hard about the life that you've led.

As far as I can see,
There's no reason for goodbyes,
You're just running scared,
And that's something I won't buy.

So you lose,
I won't let you go with nothing to show but more blues,
And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news,
So you settle down and stay with the man that loves you.

Kate Rusby,"One night, a long time ago
Two lovers danced to an old radio
The music played clear and bright
The radio sweethearts waltzed all night

She was pretty, he was tall
He placed the furniture next to the wall
They closed their eyes, the stars shone bright
The radio sweethearts waltzed all night

Years have passed, the lovers are gone
The story is over I'm told
But I believe, and I always will
The radio sweethearts are waltzin' still

Last night, I had a dream
That mama and papa had met once again
There in the glow of heaven's light
Oh, the radio sweethearts waltzed all night

Years have passed, the lovers are gone
The story is over I'm told
But I believe, and I always will
The radio sweethearts are waltzin' still

See the sunrise from a tropic isle

Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me

I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too

When my body feels tired
And my soul is weak
Then my eyes won't see
And my hands won't feel a thing

When I don't get inspired
By something you tell me at night
Just an empty soul
I don't have control of myself
Just an empty soul
I don't have control of myself

Help me to cope - Can you fix this ?
Fill the void that's left inside of me
Repair the lost of love dividing me

I wanna know - Can you fix this ?
Help me to cope - Can you fix this ?
Fill the void that's left inside of me
Repair the lost of love dividing me

Try to give me devotion
'Cause my heart can't breathe
And my tears will fall
And my eyes will try to see

I can't show my emotions
Help me out of this pain
'Cause I'm paralyzed and it's driving me insane.
'Cause I'm paralyzed and it's driving me insane.

The rain, the rain on me, rain on me

So I will find a place, where I can hide from the sky
And I will wait in this place,
'Cause I know you're trying to

Open up your sky
Push away the dark clouds and shine
Forget the thunder so loud, don't be afraid
Show yourself ! Don't hide now 

The rain, the rain on me, rain on me
The rain, the rain on me, rain on me

I don't know how high you can see
but it's all grey water falling down on me
The sun needs to shine normally

So I will find a place, where I can hide from the sky
And I will wait in this place,
'Cause I know you're trying to",The Rain

Love to hold you love to feel your lips on mine
All I am, all I do it's all for you

I've never been in love like this before
You come into my world forever more
Step into the light
You feel it when you're right
It's all for you

This must be madness what a rush to have you near
Magic all around us, when we touch it's so sincere
All I am, all I do it's all for you

How many times is enough?

How many times do I have to rise and fall?
How many times?
How many times hit my head against the wall?

I'm breaking the border of myself
It's time that I learned from
The mistakes that has made
This never ending circle of just heartaches

Now is the time
To get it together and shine
Try to figure out of
Who I am and what I want

How many times do I have to rise and fall?
Once again defeated
How many times hit my head against the wall?
'Till I find the secret

So many nights that I cried a thousand tears
For the one who turned out not to be the one
How many times is enough?

So I'm alone here once again
Now I can hardly feel the pain anymore
I'm broken but not scattered into pieces

This life is mine
Just have to stand up and fight
Try to figure out of
Who I am and what I want

How many times do I have to rise and fall?
Once again defeated
How many times hit my head against the wall?

Why imagine what our love could be?
You know you wanna
Touch the passion that's inside of me
Get outta your mind

Lose your body control
You'll never get high 'till you let it all go
So why imagine
Just how good our love could be?

In the dark
It's the heat of the moment that matters
Like a spark
That is turned into a fire

And the only thing that I wanna do
Is feel my heartbeat next to you

But it's not so easy
To make up your mind

Try to find what life's supposed to be

Not sure what I feel about you
I don't know, baby I don't know

Lately can't stop the dreaming
How come you know exactly
What to do when I don't know

Something had me want it
I just let it go isn't that ironic?
How I can't say, ""No""
I cannot explain, can't put my finger on it

The touch a constant craving
For more of something only
You know and I still don't know
What happened to me

Tonight when magic happens
Alive counting the seconds
Till you're here want you oh so near

Kate Schutt,"I am an old woman named after my mother
My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were lightning thunder was desire
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago

[Chorus]
Make me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

[Chorus]

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say.

Shocked by the deaths that took place in Beijing
It seems strange that she should be offended
The same orders are given by her

You said I was childish and you'll say it now

If they hated me they will hate you
England's not the mythical land of Madame George and roses
It's the home of police who kill black boys on mopeds
And I love my boy and that's why I'm leaving
I don't want him to be aware that there's
Any such thing as grieving

Five a.m., looking for food for her kids
In her arms she holds three cold babies
And the first word that they learned was please

I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flash back warm night, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometime you pictured me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, ""go slow, I fall behind""

And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

Each star's a pool of water, cool water
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water, cool, clear, water

Tonight we pray for water, cool, water
And way up there He'll hear our prayer
And show us where there's water, cool, clear, water

For lo the days are hast'ning on by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heav'n and earth shall on the Prince of peace 
their king
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels 
sing

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings 
unfurled
And still their heavenly music floats o'er all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing

Yet with the woes of sin and strife the world has suffered long
Beneath the heavenly strain have rolled two thousand years of 
wrong
And man at war with man hears not the tidings which they bring
O hush the noise ye men of strife and hear the angels sing

O ye, beneath life's crushing load whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When peace shall over all the earth its ancient splendors fling
And the whole world give back the song which now the angels sing",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

Bells on bob-tail ring,
making spirits bright,

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way!

I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;

Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

the story I must tell

And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

two-forty as his speed

And crack! you'll take the lead.

The starlight gleaming in your eyes;
Remembering all these little things,

Kate Smith,"My mama done tol' me,
When I was in knee pants,
My mama done tol' me, Son!
A woman'll sweet talk
And give ya the big eye;
But when the sweet talkin's done,
A woman's a two face
A worrisome thing
Who'll leave ya t'sing
The blues in the night

Now the rain's a-fallin',
Hear the train a-callin'
Whoo-ee (my mama done tol' me)
Hear that lonesome whistle
Blowin' `cross the trestle,
Whoo-ee (my mama done tol' me)
A whoo-ee-duh-whoo-ee, ol' clickety clack's
A-echoin' back the blues in the night

The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin'
And the moon'll hide its light
When you get the blues in the night

Take my word, the mockin' bird'll
Sing the saddest kind o' song
He knows things are wrong and he's right

From Natchez to Mobile,
From Memphis to St. Jo,
Wherever the four winds blow,
I been in some big towns,
An' heard me some big talk,
But there is one thing I know
A woman's a two face,
A worrisome thing
Who'll leave ya t'sing the blues in the night.

There's blues in the night.",Blues in the Night
Kate Smith,"All our friends keep knocking at the door
They've asked me out a hundred times or more
But all I say is, ""Leave me in the gloom""
And here I stay within my lonely room
'Cause

I don't want to walk without you, Baby
Walk without my arm about you, Baby
I thought the day you left me behind
I'd take a stroll and get you right off my mind

I don't want to walk without the sunshine

Kate Smith,"That certain night
The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

I may be right I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole damned world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkeley square

How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
To those hazy crazy nights we met
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

Ah this heart of mine
Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The dawn came stealing up
All gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous
I still remember how you smiled and said
Was that a dream or was it true?

Our homeward step was just as light
As the dancing feet of Astaire
And like an echo far away
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

And sometimes I whisper what I'm thinking of, 
My cup runneth over with love, 

Sometimes in the evening when you do not see, 
I study the small things you do constantly, 
I memorize moments that I'm fondest of,

Kate Smith,"""Clang, clang, clang"" went the trolley
""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song
Kate Smith,"Angels, come to paint the desert nightly,
When the moon is beaming brightly, 
Along the Santa Fe trail,
Stardust scattered all along the highway,on a rainbow colored skyway,
Along the Santa Fe trail,
Beside you, I'm riding every hill and dale,
While shadows hide me, just like a pretty purple veil,
Thereby hangs a tale,I found you and the mountains that surround you, are the walls I built around you.

We vowed our true love, though a word wasn't said 
The world was in bloom, there were stars in the skies 
Except for the few that were there in your eyes 

Dear, as I held you close in my arms 
Angels were singing a hymn to your charms 
Two hearts gently beating, murmuring low 
""Darling, I love you so"" 

The night seemed to fade into blossoming dawn 
The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on 
Could we but recall that sweet moment sublime 
We'd find that our love is unaltered by time

And I'm on my way.

I'm stepping out with a memory tonight,
To paint the town the way we used to do.
I'll dine at the old cafe where we had so much fun,
And order cocktails for two instead of the usual one.

And blamed the moon up above,

That it will all come back to me someday.",It All Comes Back to Me Now

For the moon refused to shine. 
Couple sitting underneath a willow tree, 
For love they did pine, 
Little maid was kinda 'fraid of darkness 
So she said, ""I guess I'll go."" 
Boy began to sigh, looked up at the sky, 
Told the moon his little tale of woe: 

""oh, shine on, shine on harvest moon up in the sky. 
I ain't had no lovin' since January, February, June or July 
Snowtime ain't no time to stay outdoors and spoon, 
So shine on, shine on harvest moon - for me and my gal !"" 

I can't see why a boy should sigh, 
When by his side is the girl he loves so true, 
All he has to say is: 
""won't you be my bride, 
For I love you, 
Why should I be telling you this secret, 
When I know that you can guess?,"" 
Harvest moon will smile, 
Shine on all the while, 
If the little girl should answer ""yes.""

Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

And wanna cry but the melody keeps haunting me 
reminding me how in love we used to be.

ev'rytime I hear our favorite song, now you're gone, left this emptiness, 
I only reminisce.
The happiness we spent, we used to dance to the music
make romance to the music, 
now it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning

Smart girl, soft eyes
Took in a hard world and saw it
Fast forward
She’s moving for money in bars full of tourists
She’s moved up to massage
She’s happy, she’s in charge

Talking to clients
Adoring the silence
Of after the session
Her and the night air
How to be more than the sum of your parts?
She knows how they see her but they don’t know half

I never wanted to be anybody other
Than the person that I am
And the things that I discovered
In the circles that I ran
Have been difficult and humbling
Some don’t understand
But I’m happiest when struggling

She’s not reluctant to touch
It’s the one thing
That must bring us closer together
It’s such an important endeavour
To feel tender
She can’t believe there are some
Who have never been held in their lives
Eight months in a boardroom
Three on the motorway
One in a small room
Watching the dawn loom large over grey bricks
It’s not sordid, it’s sacred
To open them up to the warmth
Of her nature; it’s ancient
She don’t wanna do it forever
But let’s face it
Wages are fucked
And rent is outrageous
Some might say that she’s being degraded
But she makes her own mind up
Knows her own morals
She don’t care ‘bout how most people see it

One man’s certain is another man’s squabble
Life’s to be lived
Not agreed with
She’s making her living
And she’s making it safely
Better than slaving away in an office
Or killing herself to fill some boss’s pockets
Working for peanuts and making them conkers

I never wanted to be anybody other
Than the person that I am
And the things that I discovered
In the circles that I ran
Have been difficult and humbling
Some don’t understand
But I’m happiest when struggling

Well all of us walk to our own beat
And each person’s rhythm is unique
You can’t hear somebody’s tune
If you count in your time
You must count their time
To enjoy how their mind
Makes its music

She fell in love with a suitor
His name was Pete and while she was at work
He got stoned and watched snooker
And when she got home he cooked food for them both
They were happy and close
But she could feel it pulling at the threads of their tapestry
Unravelling all that he knew to be true

He’s the type to say, ‘This is reality’
He finds it very hard to alter his view
But, gradually
She has felt less and less certain
That his understanding would stretch
And now she’s got to justify all her decisions
But he doesn’t listen, just gets upset
But she, in her wisdom, is ready to try
She thinks of his feelings
She kisses his neck in the evenings
Tells him, for them she’s a sweet thing
In-between meetings
But he has her depth and the whole of her

But when he’s holding her hand
It feels less like her hand
And more like his hand
And when he’s kissing her face
It feels less like her face
And more like his face

She’s become displaced
Is she herself?
Or is she the girl that he wants her to be?
She tells him, ‘I don’t want to hurt you
But your judgements are heavy
And they’re hurting me’

I never wanted to be anybody other
Than the person that I am
And the things that I discovered
In the circles that I ran
Have been difficult and humbling
Some don’t understand
But I’m happiest when struggling",Theme from Becky
Kate Tempest,"Who's bad? Said the the kiddy in the Jacko hat
To the kiddy in the Rooney shirt
Dragging back
The curtains in the room in her daddy's flat
A young girl heard the truth in an alley-cat
Howling on the roof next door
Imagine that
All your idols were just like you
Nothing's beyond you
Do what you want to do if you feel that it wants you to
Look
True never meant nothing more than it means right now
When everything's fake
But you in your deepest reaches keeping secrets
Know what it takes to make a meaning means something
I’m moving through a space that some can't see
I know this space exists
So do you if your heart beats the oldest groove
Life is huge but we have shrunk it
We've made it small
We used to walk tall
But who cares, right?
We’re having a ball

Them things you don't show, I can see
Them things you don't say, speak to me
Them things you hide ain't hiding
No firm ground but we ain't sliding

Them things that haunt you, let them be
That thing you weep for, leave it

All life is forwards, you will see
It needs you to need it

Go ahead, keep it in ‘til it withers you
Move fast, don’t stop, you got things to do
Tell yourself, it’s them man it isn’t you
Nod your head and believe that until it’s true
You can tell it not to show its face
When you are trying to hold your space
But it’s in you deep in your sinews
And it comes out on the coldest days

See the kid with the memory he can’t shake
See the man with the lover on his mind
See the lady with the guilt and the heartache
See the woman trying to battle with time
See the man with the blood on his hands
See the girl with her hands on her hips
Everybody say nothing. Stay bland
If you don’t show it then it don’t exist
Right?

Them things you don't show, I can see
Them things you don't say, speak to me
Them things you hide ain't hiding
No firm ground but we ain't sliding

Them things that haunt you, let them be
That thing you weep for, leave it

All life is forwards, you will see
It's yours when you’re ready to receive it

You’re so focused on finding the differences
You ignore the bonds that bind us
Got my hand on my heart when the rhythm hits
It’s looking for us but can’t find us
In the valley of vanity, viciousness
Full schedules and empty containers
We’re kissing the coshes that cripple us
Enjoying the Beigeness
Do it your way and they’ll find you ridiculous
Pick apart your behaviour
Their scorn ignites what inhibits us
And then we hate ourselves
And our fear pickles us
Sitting in jars ‘cause it’s safer
Some of us are happy to live with it
But some of us know it’s against our nature

Them things you don't show, I can see
Them things you don't say, speak to me
Them things you hide ain't hiding
No firm ground but we ain't sliding

Them things that haunt you, let them be
That thing you weep for, leave it

All life is forwards, you will see
It's yours when you’re ready to receive it

All life is forwards you will see",The Beigeness
Kate Tempest,"Harry’s staring at his chicken
He’s trying hard to listen without hating
But everything David says
Seems to make him like him less
His little brother Pete is waiting
For the appropriate place to say
‘Oh right, yeah’
And make an interested face

Miriam feels distant
She knows her sons are trying hard
But trying hard
Just increases the friction
It’s never been tense like this

Harry looks around at his mother’s new kitchen
And can’t help but think of his dad

Alone in that house where they all used to live
Putting his half pint of semi-skimmed
Back into the fridge
Dad
With his silent ways
And his smiling face
No romance, just basic
Straight forwards, no frills, no fuss
But at least he was a man you could trust

Not like this guy, this David
Face like a pill head at the end of a rave
Staring at my mum like he wants to be saved
Harry feels weak today, he can’t take it

And he doesn’t know it but he’s glaring
Thinking of Becky
And why he insisted on sharing
So much with a stranger
He feels a faint sense of danger
Ashamed that he’d made a
Fool of himself, he’s an idiot
Sees it in his mind’s eye, insidious
Him, spilling out his guts like a suicidal shogun
Looking for deliverance
Dithering fool feeling silly and hopelessly broken
Blithering on while she was smoking

What was he thinking?
Heart opening up like it was blinking
Becky. He feels her name, it’s heavy
Don’t forget me

Snap back to the room
He flinches at the image
Miriam is finishing her wine
And Pete is asking for the spinach

‘Er, how’s work, Harry?’
David’s features are tipped towards him
‘Fine, thanks,’ Harry looks up, ‘exhausting.’
‘Yes,’ David smiles, ‘but hard work is always rewarding.’
Even David’s enthusiasm is boring

‘How long have you worked there?’ he asks
And Harry thinks of all them years he’s spent
Scheming and shotting
‘Little while, now. To be honest, I’ve forgotten.’
‘Oh yes, well time does fly in the work place,’
David smiles, nodding

All he ever wanted to be was good enough
All he ever wanted to say was the right thing
But as long as you live for the way you’re perceived
You will never create, only bite things

All he ever wanted to do was the done thing
All he ever wanted to make was the grade
But as long as you live for other people’s opinions
You’ll never be more than afraid",Chicken
Kate Tempest,"I’m in a mess, I can’t help it
I just go round and round
I’m paranoid, I’m selfish
Push me, I clam up, I’m shellfish

That eats me up, that’s Elvis
Las Vegas era
I’m half bag lady, half Bagheera

I got my hand on my heart
But my heart’s in the gutter
Talking to itself, starting to flutter
When it thinks about yours
Barking at mutts like a nutter
Trying to start wars on the bus

Dumb chunk of muscle with its claws out
Throwing its oars out the dinghy in the middle of a gale
Making whirlpools the way I chase my tail

I go round in circles

Not neatly, not like compass and pencil

Sitting in a pub with my eyes closed
Swaying to a power ballad
Shredding tears at the high notes
My hands are frozen, I forgot my gloves
My heart is broken, I don’t want no love
Love just rots your guts
If you’re the type to feel what you touch

No wait, my hands are smoking on this hot tea cup

Love will prop you up

I keep repeating myself
There must be more than this
I don’t know why I can’t change
There ain’t no groundhogs here
There’s just me in my garden
Howling at the moon when it’s round and clear

Kick a fag box and you might find it’s got some in it
I love that
Just when I think something’s ending
The beginning comes back

Get away with a child travelcard on the bus
I love that
Just when I think something’s ending
The beginning comes back

See something great
Happen to a mate
I love that

Kate Tempest,"Dale was Pete's Mum's new boyfriend's son
He had a mouth that was too small for his toungue
Teeth like a ladder that was missing a rung
Chin looked like it was trying to run
He had a laugh like a car crash
Eyes like Pot holes in tarmac
Complexion the colour of chewed up bar snacks
Kinda guy spend his whole life getting laughed at

When all you've got is a hammer, everything looks like nails
If you bow to the hand that damns ya, everything fails
The things you do, do you
The plans you hatch, hatch monsters
Unless you watch your moves
Your own fists will knock you unconscious

Pete took him to the pub and the conversation dragged
So Pete got pissed, pretty soon he had more than his usual
Approaching legless
He found himself opening up
I got to get this off my chest, he said
With his head in his hands
I got this girlfriend but I can't stand the way things are going
Right, she's got this job but I don't like it
It pisses me off!
I don't even know what we're fightin' for but these days
Me and her, we are fightin' more than I'd like
And then out comes the white and Dale looks at him in the clinical light of the toilets
""Why what does she do?""
Pete looks at his shoes and says ""She's a masseuse""

(Pete) ""You could call her up, you could book a session
You could push her, see if she responds and then
You can tell me everything and we will both see that I was wrong
To have ever doubted that she would be anything but the mother of
Pure modesty cause I know she loves me, she just does this to pay the bills
And to exist in a way that will give her the means to live for for than a dull routine""
Dale nods
Bells ring in Pete's head
But he looks at Dale: those clumsy legs, that sunken chest, that spotty neck
This is the perfect man to do the test

Kate Tempest,"‘Everybody Down!
He’ll be here in a second, I reckon’
And Becky beckoned them round
And made them get on their knees
Behind the bar
They held their breath
And stifled giggles

Crouched down
Like a twenty-headed beast
That writhed and wriggled
‘Happy Birthday, Pete!
Another year older, eh?’
‘I never expected a thing
I don’t know what to say.’
Harry couldn’t look at the way
Pete held Becky’s hands
Still he passed him a beer and said
‘Well, there you go, big man.’

‘Harry, this is Ron
Ron, this is Harry, my brother
You guys should really talk to one another
Ron runs the caff and
Harry’s starting up a place up of his own if he can.’
They raised their glasses up
‘Good to meet you, Ron.’
‘Ah, pleasure’s all mine.’
Ron looks into Harry’s eyes and recognises how they shine
Harry. He says the name to himself
Before he’s led away and introduced to someone else

‘Becky, this is Dale,’
Pete’s drunk now, warm inside
Dale’s awkward with a sort of
Distorted and cautious pride on his face
‘Actually, we’ve met’
‘Really? I’m sorry,’ says Becky
‘Don’t pretend that you forgot me already?’
‘Where’d you meet?’ says Pete
Big smile, white teeth
‘She was working, you remember
It was you that made me ring her?’
It hits Pete, like a fist
Where every finger wears a ring
He couldn’t blink or breathe or think or anything

‘Yeah, you remember?
The twenty-third of November
I met you in the Hotel Hacienda
We had a couple drinks
You knew the bartender
You had a Whisky Sour
And I had a Monumenta

We went up in the lift
They was playing Enya
That made you laugh
You said that Enya sent ya round the bend
Pete was scared that you’d been sleeping with men
So he asked me to investigate
Now, in your defense
You was very professional
I was very tense
But I have to say my favorite part
Was the Happy End.’

Ron was in the toilets, washing his hands
When he heard what sounded like a man
Sniffing a whole gram
In one go
Harry walked out of the cubicle, ‘Oh!
Alright, Ron?’
Ron tapped his nose
‘You ain’t got a spare line?’
Harry smiled, ‘No sweat.’
Handed him the wrap and said, ‘I’m going for a cigarette
I’ll meet you at the bar, mine’s a pint of Sea View.’
Ron only had to look at the coke
And he knew

She was dumbstruck
She could feel herself going numb
Clutched thumbs in her fists
Felt unstuck
‘This is wrong!
Fuck this!’
Her stomach heaved
‘You set me up
Instead of just talking to me?
What about trust?’
Guts twisted
Pete was stuck to the spot, his lips shifted
He couldn’t make a sound

Dale stood still, calm
Pete stared dumb
Reached out, touched her arm

She shook it off
So livid, so hurt
She walked away without saying another word
He was about to follow
But saw Dale hiding a smile
Then he couldn’t help it
He saw red, he went wild

‘Alright, look, son
I know we’ve come to have a party
So have a couple of drinks
And a dance with your auntie
But hear this
Let’s clear this up right now
Your numbers are up, son
I have found you out

You don’t know who I work for
Men who have hurt more
Men than the world wars
When you were first born
They were killing men who were worth more
Than ten of your kind
Are you out of your mind?

Look, don’t worry, son
I’m in no hurry, son
I’ll have you on the run
Like a funny curry, son
Go back inside and make sure
Your brother’s having fun
Just know this:
Any day now, I’ll be coming son.’

Becky ran out to the street feeling weak
She took a breath

Heart slamming its head against the wall of her chest
She looked to her left
Saw Ron, shoulders squared
Talking to Harry
Harry looked awkward, scared

‘What’s this, mother’s meeting?
Come on, Harry, need your help.’
She walked him off as Ron watched
Harry felt himself melt
‘Becky,’ he began
But he couldn’t finish
He fiddled with a cigarette
Held it between his fingers
‘What’s up?’
She didn’t need to ask, she could feel it there
‘You got yourself in trouble with my Uncle?’
‘Yeah’

He stared at the skyline
He tried find the right words
‘I gotta leave town
And tonight at the latest.’
They stopped walking, turned
Looked into each other’s faces
‘And I want you to come with me.’
Time stopped
Harry waited

She said nothing
She raised her eyebrows
Like he did on the night they met
In this way they spoke at length
And his heart heard what her eyes said

He said nothing
He just felt and hoped that he was understood
Then she felt something in her melt
And lightening flashed and thunder shook

He stared at her until she heard him
Felt an energy go surging through her person
Something in his eyes
She felt her body bursting

She kissed him
And it reached a part of her that had been sleeping
And she felt his heart beating in her own
She felt complete and so known

They didn’t speak
Ran down the street
Leon had the motor running
And they jumped in the back seat
Becky felt peace when she looked at his face
‘Lets us three get on a plane and open up Harry’s Place’
He stared at her, ‘Really?’
She nodded, his pulsed raced
He reached down beside him
Brought out a suitcase
Stuffed full of cash
Leon smiled at them both
‘Let’s fucking do it,’ He said
Away they drove

Dale and Pete
Were in a pile of trainers and feet
Clenched fists and black eyes and chipped teeth
Their dads had tried
To get in-between them
It was like they couldn’t wait to get involved
Graham was beating David’s skull with his elbows
David was kneeing Graham’s nether regions
And Miriam was at the bar weeping
Ron was pleased as punch
With the outcome of the evening
While Becky, Harry and Leon headed for the beyond

Off to Dover for the ferry
And from there, wherever
Harry looked at Becky
‘Let’s feel this way forever?’

Counting out his money

Sharpening knives
The moonlight whispers
In the dark of the skies

Friends since before they could say the word ‘friend’
Two sides of the same coin
Two-man industry, they play it very cool
Harry’s got the plans, Leon’s got the heavy tools
Sell at high price to discerning clientele
But tonight Harry’s worried, though
‘Cause Leon’s high as hell

Leon’s in the corner with a Pina Colada
And two girls, Rachel and Renata
Keeping one eye on Harry
And the other on the dancefloor

The guy standing next him
Turns to him and he says to him:
‘I’m a friend of Pico’s, I heard you need the medicine’
Harry looks him up and down, like
I don’t like the stench of him
Without saying anything, Harry’s on his feet
Walking to the back room, trying to look discreet

The guy that he’s following is flabby round the middle
Wearing a blue suit, pink tie, new boots
Slick hair to the side, little ‘tache
And he walks with a limp
He talks with a sort of distorted lisp
Leon’s on his feet, staying hidden
As they step into the back room, he slips in with them

You’ve got to do what you’ve got to do

The guy says, ‘Call me Joey
This here is my place
I’m the King to Pico’s Ace
And I hope for your sake mate that you ain’t no joker.’
Harry says nothing
Joey beckons to the sofa

They sit either side of a glass-topped tank
There’s a baby shark inside, about a metre long
The room is dim lit and the walls are blank
Joey says, ‘Now we both know that Pico’s gone
Away for a little while
Before he left, he said you was a good guy
No funny business.’
Joey takes a package from the chest by the desk
And he puts it on the tank and
His eyes shine vicious and cold
Now he’s pouring out a brandy
Saying, ‘This is premium quality
Do you understand me?
Since Pico’s departure, the prices have risen
It’s double what it used to be
Ok?’

Sitting there quietly
Harry opens up his suitcase
‘I’ll pay you what I paid him.’
Joey smiles like his tooth aches
All lop-sided and strange
He says, ‘You’ll pay me what I ask for
Or you walk away with nothing
You know full well
It’s the best coke in the country
You either deal with me or your customers go hungry
What’s the matter, Harry? You look a little jumpy
Cat got your tongue or something?’

Leon’s watching from the corner
Wondering if he’s bluffing
Joey’s waiting
Harry’s saying, ‘No
No negotiating.’
Joey says: ‘It’s more pure
Than what you’ve had before
This is straight off the boat
No joke
Where’s the notes?’

In a breath, Leon’s out from his hiding place
Steel toes, hurricane hands, calm face
Joey drops suddenly
Like a kid with his first pill
Harry’s at the stash
Getting the cash
Leon works ‘til
Joey’s just a pattern in the carpet
Harry shakes his head and puts the package in his jacket
‘What?’ says Leon
‘Ain’t worth doing nothing half-hearted.’
Harry buttons his coat and tries to settle his

Eyes full of mornings
Spent without sleeping
Grew up in a city where it’s hard to be heard

Sits there in his chest
With his arms crossed, screwing

Gets up from his chair

She looks away, she’s petrified

It’s Becky’s mate’s birthday They’re out for the night
Now, Becky’s mate is the nightmare type
She’ll flirt with anyone
Scream at the top of her voice
But it’s her birthday so Becky
Don’t really have a choice

He sees her in the queue
He doesn’t know what to do
She’s more beautiful than he remembers Then she says
‘Alright?’
And he tries to say something funny
But stutters
And now he feels like a muppet and blushes (No, No, No)

Inside it’s the usual scene
They’re dancing at the bar, waiting to get served
Becky’s mate’s screaming about something absurd
And they’re all fake laughing
Even though nobody heard a word

So now he’s hunting around the room
Staring into every booth
The back of every head could be hers It’s no use
He stops by the bar, thinking
Man, I’ll never find her
And then he realises that he’s standing beside her

He stands there awkward
His eyes are as loud as the bass
And she can recognise something in his face
She scribbles down her number
Lingering glance
And lets herself think
Maybe this could be her chance

But will it be this way forever?
These are lonely days
What if she could be the one that makes it better?
He looks away, can’t hold her gaze
But will it be this way forever?
These are stressful times
What if he could be the one that gets her?
She looks away, she’s petrified",Lonely Daze
Kate Tempest,"Everywhere is monsters
Tits out, wet-mouthed, heads back
Shouting and screaming just to prove they exist

Becky’s at the bar with the usual mix
Of decadent fabrics and desolate lighting
Everybody here has got a hyphenated second name
Blowing more breeze
Than the wind at the weather vane

Industry slimeballs, showbiz big-deals
The cool new band with the retro feel
It’s the wrap party for their video
Becky danced in it
The director, Marshall Law
Head to toe in yellow velour
Is holding court about the science of image
While the sycophants giggle and grimace
Becky fidgets, tells herself
‘Must stop being so cynical
Everybody here is a human
Even these pitiful posturing pop stars and idiots.’
She tells herself to look again -
Nothing is hideous

So while Marshall Law is wanking on about his artwork
She smiles at the guy opposite
Bright eyes, dark shirt
He raises his eyebrows in the direction of Marshall
‘My name’s Becky,’ she says
‘What’s yours?’

She was like nothing that he’d seen before
Strong body, soft edges, with something so raw
In the core of her iris
He said his name, ‘Harry’
And never in his life had he felt so happy
They got talking
Free bar. Exhausting decorum
He drank until she was so absorbing
He blanked out the party
The floor spun, he stared at her face and felt sure
Something was happening here

He was kinda nervous
His eyes kept doing circuits of the room
He drank as fast as they could serve him
Then this dude comes over
Sticks out a thick hand
And Harry looks at her
Like he’s just found himself in quicksand
He gives this guy a wrap, they shake hands
Sweaty cash passed between palms
No fuss. Bish bash, yes, bosh
He looked at her guiltily
She waved it off, smiling
‘You a shotter then, right?
I don’t care.’

‘Becky, all I ever wanted was a place of my own.’
His eyes, wide and trusting
He’s staring at her, desperate for something to click
He is opening up. This is it
‘A real classy place, the whole bit
Like a speakeasy, right?
Chandeliers and lights
That shine off of the glasses
No hype, and no arseholes
Instead of rotting our guts out
In shitty old boozers
We can be grown men, listening to music
Real music. Played with heart by real bands
Not just posers looking like they’re
Giving blowjobs to mic stands
And I’ll be in a waistcoat, dead grand
Harry’s Place
Or, at least, that’s the plan.’

She was half listening
Half not listening
Kept getting distracted by the lights flickering
He looks like an outline that needs filling in
He leans in close, starts whispering:

‘The thing is, and it’s weird
I never felt so able
To talk like this to anybody, ever
Recently Becky, I’ve been really feeling the pressure
I can’t tell you how good it is
To get this off my chest.’

Becky’s holding tight to her glass
Good coke, brain fast
She watches his face as he talks
Little bump on her fingertips
Expert. Quick snort
Sucking on a cigarette, feeling vaguely bored

It’s true if you believe it
The world is the world
But it’s all how you see it
One man’s flash of lightning ripping through the air
Is another’s passing glare, hardly there
It’s true if you believe it
The world is the world
But it’s all how you see it
One man’s flash of lightning ripping through the air
Is another’s passing glare, hardly there

‘If I’m being honest, well it is
It’s like a trap
I ain’t trying to be flash
I just need to raise the cash for the dream
I hardly touch it myself
Look, it ain’t that
But once I set myself a task
Well, there ain’t no going back
And I am halfway there
I am, nearly, anyway
The point is
I kinda had to push all of my friends away
I can’t have nobody
Knowing what I’m up to
I keep it very secret but the thing is
I would love to
Just for one day
You know, live like any other guy
I can’t have a girlfriend, you see
‘Cause I don’t like to lie
It’s safer all round
That I just keep my head down
And, yeah, the business is booming
Yeah, the business is really booming
But my family think I work in recruitment
So, I get up every morning
And I put a shirt and suit on
And I get on a train, I go up town
It’s all professional users
I sell in the boardrooms and not the boozers
To, like, CEOs and these modern day Scrooges
Who get their secretaries to bring me coffee
It’s so stupid
Meant to be hard times, right, a recession?
But these guys are buying more than ever, I reckon
And I…

He’s got nice eyes
Shame about his issues, though
The party pushes on, her cynicism’s getting vicious
Show nothing
Keep smiling

She catches the eye of her mates
They’re dancing by the bar
They’re in a state
Nod for ‘save me’
They understand, dance over
Put their arms around her shoulders -
‘Becky, we’re bored, let’s go’
His mouth slows to a stop
He seems to lose his composure
She smiles at him
‘Yeah, was nice getting to know ya.’

No, not like that, don’t leave
Please
Don’t make her go, we’ve just got started

Their teeth are bare, their feet are planted
Their smirking at him like he’s dirt
And now his heart is
Damp with the fury of
Finding and losing
This miracle girl
He feels weak with confusion, like
What had he said?
How long had he talked?
He watches them walk to the doors
His blood roars

In the back of the cab, the girls sit there giggling
The driver lets them smoke out of the window
So they’re shivering
They pass a bottle of wine back and forth
Let it clash against their teeth
The cab moves fast through the streets
‘Who was that guy you was with?’
Becky shakes her head softly
‘Him? I don’t know, probably alright
But I could tell he was one of them “save me” types
And I couldn’t be dealing with that
Not tonight.’",Marshall Law
Kate Tempest,"‘It feels like we could make something happen
That ain’t ever happened before.’
‘Let’s never get bored
Of each other.’
‘And let’s always want more
Of each other.’

They lay on the floor with each other
Amazed by how right it felt
They smiled and they caught their breath
And they thought of nothing else

They lay there silent
Not touching
She’s crying
Backs to each other
And he’s sighing
Three days straight fighting
‘I can’t bear your self-importance.’
‘I don’t like you when you’re like this.’
‘You haven’t even kissed me for days’
‘How can I want to kiss you
When all your lips say
Is how shitty I’ve been and how little I care?’
‘What are we doing this for?’
‘I can’t bear any more of your bitching.’
They sit there in the kitchen
They didn’t look at each other
They just stared at the walls
And her head’s in her hands
And the coffee pot falls to the floor
Now he is angry and smashing up tables

He was thinking:

‘If I love you like I say
I would not treat you this way
If I love you like I think
I would not make such a stink

If this is what we had both hoped
I don’t think I’d feel so choked
If I want more, how can I get it?
I’m only staying ‘cause I’m scared
If I leave I’ll regret it.’

Pete is at home, Becky is at work
He stares out the window
Trying not to let it hurt
He folds up the washing
He watches a bit of telly
And he makes himself some dinner
But he can’t eat any
He knows it’s her job and that she is working hard
But the thought of what she does kind of rips him apart
And every time they talk about it, it just turns into a row
She says ‘If you trust me, I don’t see how
This can be a problem,’
And he can’t find the words to say -
I don’t want your hands
On another man’s vertebrae

He don’t have a leg to stand on
He ain’t earning
And she’s got rent to pay
And books to buy
She is determined
To support herself
But he looks at his girlfriend
And feels like
He is in love with a whirlwind
She rips him to pieces every night
And every morning
He finds himself doubting things
That used to be important

He drifted from his mates and he lost contact with his brother
All they really had now was each other
Eventually he gave in, he said
‘If you think it’s right
Then go ahead and work
But please don’t work tonight.’

Then she said:

‘If you love me like you say
You would not push me away
If you love me like you think
You would not make such a stink
If this is what we had both hoped
I don’t think that we’d feel so choked
If I want more, how can I get it?
You’re only staying ‘cause you’re scared
If you leave you’ll regret it.’",Stink
Kate Tempest,"In Giuseppe’s
The tablecloths shine with wear
The chairs are threadbare
But look happy to be sitting there
Becky’s cashing up
It’s the end of her shift
Her Uncle Ron’s at the counter
Drinking a Gin Fizz
It’s his place, he gave her the work
He’s like a dad to her
For better or worse
For now, he stabs at a lemon rind with a toothpick
‘What’s the matter, Ron,’ Becky says
‘Are you sick?’
He shakes his head, says ‘Troubles I got…’
And she waits for more
Focusing on a spot
On the top of his head
She ain’t noticed before
But suddenly her Uncle Rags
Comes strutting through the door
Becky sees that this means business
Some things she ain’t supposed to know
Ron smiles at her with thin lips
‘Right,’ says Becky, ‘time I go.’

Blood is thicker than ignorance
Blood is richer than oil
But love is what’s truly significant
To the victor the spoils
To the kids who can toil
To the kids who can work
Know that nothing’s worth shit ‘til it’s difficult
And nothing don’t heal ‘til it hurts

They call him Rags
Why?
‘Cause he leaves bodies in tatters
Not the type of man to be flattered
Eyes like patches on a blood stained mattress
Taps on the window and it shatters

For now he sits down heavily
His voice is soft
‘Some junior, Joey, trying to play boss
Thought he could run a scam
And now we lost about a key and a half
Whatever, a small cost to find a snake in the grass
And, yeah, Pico ain’t happy
But, you know, well, the game plays on
We think the kid’s called Harry
But we might be wrong.’

‘So we’re looking for him, yeah?’
‘Well, we were but it all got hot
You know, Pico’s inside
Too much eyes, so we stopped
Cut your losses
But the bosses
Would prefer some bodies
I’m getting too old for that now
I get my jollies
Just sitting down fishing
Yeah, It’s good to have a hobby
Keeps you on your toes
When your knees are getting wobbly.’

‘So after all that,’
Ron breathes out stale air
‘There’s no fucking panic?!’
Rags gets up. ‘Take care mate
I got a date with a lady in Mayfair
Put your knives away
And let them stay there.’

Blood is thicker than ignorance

And nothing don’t heal ‘til it hurts

If I found this guy Harry
Maybe Pico would be pleased?
Call my debts off
And I could get up off my knees?
Ron looks around at the café that he loves
Thinks how good it would be
If he could wash off all the blood
All that money from them grubby men
He’d start again
And spruce it up
Call it ‘Rebecca’s’

Kate Tempest,"It’s all relative, right?
One thought, many thinkers
One flame, many cinders
One view, many windows

Love in a time without sacrifice
We want what we want
And what’s more, we deserve it

We run around panicking
Nervous, thinking
Could this be the one?
Man, they’re perfect
Couple years later
You’re chained to the circuit
Breaking them down
As if you’re determined to waste what you’ve found

But what’s true about you?
Is it the things that you claim to be true
Or is it deeper?
Lurking in places that you
Don’t dare to journey to
Faced with a new
Way of seeing it
Are you type to accept
Or the type to clench fists and reject?

Whose truth even counts?
Is it the person who doubts
What a person proclaims they’re about?
Whose version is perfect?
Is there a truth that exists
Outside of perception?
This is the question

It’s true if you believe it
The world is the world
But it’s all how you see it
One man’s flash of lightning ripping through the air
Is another’s passing glare, its hardly there

Two people
One thinks Two’s deceitful
Two thinks One’s plain evil
One loved Two so much it was like worship
Two thought One was perfect

One said to Two
‘I’m awful, trust me
You’re so pure that you should not touch me.’
Two said
‘I don’t care, I love you
I can’t wait to know you.’
One said
‘I’m scared, I will show you
The bad side that I don’t like.’
Two said
‘Be yourself and I will be myself
We don’t need no one else
With their opinions
The past is gone, let’s move on
Make present.’
Two said
‘Ok, you’re the best.’
Well, you know the rest
It all went sour

And now Two thinks One is mad for power
One thinks Two tried to devour
Everything that made One One
But Two thinks One got Two too wrong
So if there’s one truth that lasts forever
Can two truths ever exist together?
If One loves Two but Two don’t love
Whose truth is true and is truth enough?

Well don't be shy
I've got an open heart and hand
And I just might have to confess just where I stand

Rock a bye my baby
Don't be blue tonight

I'll be thinking of that evening
When there's nothing for me to do

I hate myself for loving you
I turn my head away
But my heart will remain

It's illogical and it's outrageous
The way I let you keep me hangin' on
Your character is that contagious
I know I should have thought before I had done
I've gone and let my impulse be my guide
And on that note I'll be defenseless for some time

Just imagining again
You come to her defense
Insisting that she's innocent
Well excuse me for wanting to be
The one and only lock that fits your key
Oh you believe there's nothing up her sleeve
Oh baby, well just wait and see

You say that love is blind
Well I say open up your eyes
She's a mastermind
She'd cheat and lie to get you to love her
Who's the victim if it doesn't make a difference now?
I'll be gone one way or another

Take a minute to see it from my side of things
Don't you think you would feel the same?
Like you still gotta play for the victory in a game
You won yesterday
I shouldn't have to fight for something that's already mine
But her pursuit of you has under-mind my peace of mind
But it's no use crying to you
You're who her plan has done the damage to
What's done is done
I should just hold my tongue

Just a page in my diary
So here I am a Utopian citizen
Still convinced
There's no such thing as idealism

Memories they're following me like a shadow now
And I'm dreamin'
And I've already suffered the fever of disbelief

I'm still in love with who I wish you were

And I wish you were here

I was true as the sky is blue
I couldn't soon say the same for you
So now I find denial in my eyes

Kate Voegele,"Well I've heard there was a sacred chord
David played and it pleased the lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?

Well it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall
And the major lift,
The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing up on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.

And she tied you her kitchen chair
She broke your throne
She cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Well baby I have been here before
I've seen this room, and I've walked this floor
You know I used to live alone before I knew ya.

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?

And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Well maybe there's a god above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you.

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Oo hallelujah, oo hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah",Hallelujah
Kate Voegele,"This road is anything but simple
Twisted like a riddle I've seen high and I've seen low
So loud, the voices of all my doubts
Telling me to give up, to pack up and leave town

Even so, I had to believe
Impossible means nothing to me, yeah

So can you lift me up,
Turn the ashes into flames
'Cause I have overcome
More than words will ever say
And I've been given hope
That there's a light on up the hall
And that a day will come
When the fight is won
And I think that day has just begun

Somewhere, every body starts there
I'm counting on a small prayer,
Lost in a nightmare
But I'm here, and suddenly it's so clear
The struggle through the long years
It taught me to outrun my fears

Everything worth having, oh
Comes with trials worth withstanding

So can you lift me up,
Turn the ashes into flames
'Cause I have overcome
More than words will ever say
And I've been given hope
That there's a light on up the hall
And that a day will come
When the fight is won

Oh, lift me up
Oh, lift me up
Oh, lift me up
Lift me up

Down and out is overrated
And I need to be elevated
Looking up is not enough

Well,
I try to put your stories in line
But nothing adds up right

For every 99 times
You looked me in the eye,
You looked me in the eye
And swore you weren't lying
Well, I was so blind
I never saw the signs
I'm getting out tonight
And you're not invited

Its a shame
That you left me hanging like you did
It was brave
But it was much more foolish
Don't you think?
Cause you know I wont be satisfied
Until you realize

For every 99 times
You looked me in the eye,
You looked me in the eye
And swore you weren't lying
Well, I was so blind

I'm gone and you're invisible now

Don't need to win me over
And there ain't no other side
To shelter me from all the wrong where I decide

That I'm a whispered conscience in your ear, yeah

Kate Voegele,"How many times have you used that line?
Did you replace the last two dozen names with mine?

Is 'I love you baby,' second nature by now?
'Cause it sounds awful rehearsed
When the words leave your mouth

I don't know why but it seems
That I'm not the first to have heard this speech
Is this a routine you just repeat?
'Cause I don't mean to presume
That you don't love me like you say you do
But, you're gonna have to prove that you're true
And you're not just talkin' smooth

Your performance deserves an academy award
And it's a double edged sword, 'cause I sure feel adored

But just between us I'd rather see you slip up
Don't you know that it's those
Less than perfect words I can't get enough of

Maybe I'm outta my head
But I'm telling you baby that I've been misled
So if the record's off well could you get it set?
I don't mean to presume
That you don't love me like you say you do 
But, you're gonna have to prove that you're true
And you're not just talkin' smooth

Well, you've proven your charm is a crime
Oh, and oh, why don't you see
The harm in relying on this disguise
You're losing me with every little wink of the eye

The end of my rope is slipping out of my hold
So if you're clever you'd better do some damage control

I don't know why but it seems
You've made a game of making a fool outta me
And I did not sign up to be
Your tongue-in-cheek, hey oh, yeah

I don't mean to presume

But it seems that you're searching me 
For something you're not going to find

I'm not your anchor so don't hold on
I'm not the answer you got me wrong
I'm not your savior, save your energy
To find out who you are, yeah who you are without me

See it hurts me to tell you this

It's awful close, yeah

In an ordinary fairy tale land
There's a promise of a perfect happy end
And I imagine having just short of that
Is better than nothing

So you'll be mine
Forever and almost always
And I'll be fine
Just love me when you can
And I'll wait patiently
I'll wake up everyday
Just hoping that you still care

In the corner of my mind I know too well
Oh, that surely even I deserve the best
But instead of leaving
I just put the issue to bed
And outta my head

Oh, and just when I believe
You've changed for good
Well, you go and prove me wrong
Just like I knew you would
When I run out of second chances
You give me that look
And you're off the hook

Because you're mine
Forever and almost always
Oh, and I'm fine
Just love me when you can
And I'll wait patiently
I'll wake up everyday
Just hoping that you'll still care

What are you doing later?
I don't know my way through a maze
Of gray skyscrapers
But I'm willing to learn

If you want me to, I'll stay just where I am
But I promise just to follow where I land
You can take my word
For that

You are my Manhattan from the sky
You look so neat and tidy when I'm way up high
But I know your streets are lined with a fine mess inside
I wanna come down and walk around your mind

Daisies, once upon an old daydream
That's what you gave me
Out on the corner of Broadway and 48th street
On a rainy afternoon

Well I could start discovering your world
And I would make a damn good city girl
Things would start to bloom
I'm sure

You are my Manhattan from the sky
You look so neat and tidy when I'm way up high
But I know your streets are lined with a fine mess inside
I wanna come down and walk around your mind

I know you want me to see it; don't lie to me
So why you gotta go be so shy to me?
I ain't buying the false anxiety
Let your fortress fall

What is it gonna take to get you there?
If fear was money, you'd be a millionaire
All alone in a leather swivel chair
Counting stacks of gold

You are my Manhattan from the sky
You look so neat and tidy when I'm way up high
But I know your streets are lined with a fine mess inside
I wanna come down and walk around

Downhearted and hoping
I'm close to some new beginning
I know
There's a reason for everything
That comes and goes

But so many people are looking to me
To be strong and to fight
But I'm just surviving
I may be weak but I'm never defeated
And Ill keep believing
In clouds with that sweet silver lining

Most days
I try my best to put on a brave face
But inside
My bones are cold and my heart breaks
But all the while
Somethings keeping me safe
And alive

But so many people are looking to me
To be strong and to fight
But I'm just surviving
I may be weak but I'm never defeated

I will be given strength
And now that Ive found it
Nothing can take that away",Sweet Silver Lining

Brighter when I'm next to you

'Cause running out of reasons not to feel this
I can tell you're dying to try

Underneath the streetlights

These are the beautiful things in life
So give me that off the shoulder dress
The one that the boys will not forget

Maybe I should pack my bags and fly to Costa Rica
Put a flower in my hair, a dancing senorita

Oh put a little sunshine in my sky
Oh what a lovely day to be alive
These eyes are longing to see a sign of summer
To leave my cares in the breeze
Oh put a little sunshine in my sky

So let's go skinny dip tonight
Under the cotton candy skies
Would you if I asked you?
A campfire and a backyard ballgame
Fireflies and electric lemonade
And I can't keep my eyes off you

We could pack our bags and fly to Costa Rica
You could swing me low and call me Rosalita, yeah yeah

To leave my cares in the breeze
Oh put a little sunshine in my sky

Now wouldn't it be nice to know we
Could make a great escape to paradise

If you could wrap the sun around me
And lay me down safe and soundly

Stealing my heart into the night

Lost in the woods with two crumbs for taking

Your fingers through my hair
But if you keep calling my name
I'll bury my head in the sand hoping you'll stay

How can't you be different from the rest?
Oh, won't you surprise me instead?
I've had it up to here
Please just be my darling, my dear

I knew it was hard for you to say
Quivering like a leaf as we lay

I guess that I could share

Won't you be the one

Won't you open my arms? Won't you wake me?

Enjoying the lost and found and start all over
I crib the open road like birds in summer
A chance to break the mold is all that I'm after

Can you offer anything, doctor?
Help me start again
Moving forward without awkward moves
And I would be brave

And I could leave this goldfish sea
And I could start to believe in me
And after the sun the rain would fall
And I wouldn't mind at all

And if I could just escape this body
I know I wouldn't fake for just anybody
I claw my heart for you and keep it until I was okay
With what I do that's all that I'm after

Can you offer me anything, doctor?
Help me to start again

At every step of the way

Will you understand how it feels?

When I held your hand, can't forget,
And I saw you smile as it lifted me upwards a mile.
I felt your eyes like a June sun,
As soon as you entered the room, one
Tiniest moment and I was left open.

Open to the magic that you seem to master,
And though my love is tragic you awkwardly answered.

So I said 'be mine, be mine, be my love,
Be mine, be mine, be my love,
Be mine, be mine and I'll be yours.'

So I thought I might take a chance,
When you tried but you couldn't dance,
And when you stepped closer I almost fell over.

Over from the magic that you seem to master,
And though my love is tragic you awkwardly answered.

So I said 'be mine, be mine, be my love,
Be mine, be mine, be my love,

He left me wounded on the sand,
There are no healing hands,
He left an arrow in my heart.

Like a sword is in the stone,
It keeps my blood in flow,
To pull it out would turn the lights out.

Quick shards of light on my pillow,
Remind me that I haven?t let go.
I cling on for dear life till he says so.

He signed his name with a burning flame,
All across my bones, my aching shield,
To him alone I yield,
I wished a hundred times I could feel it.

Remind me that I haven?t let go.

And guiding me through what he won?t show,

Kate Wolf,"She rises like the dolphin, with the sea wind in her eyes. 
The sunlight casting shadows, like a painter's palette knife
Her hair fans out around her, floating like a crown.
She plays on the water, lets it pull her down.

Sometimes she swims in moonlight with the stars high above. 
The night sounds of the water speaking soft of love.
Her skin turns to velvet as she feels the waters glide. 
She loses all her boundaries on this magic carpet ride.

You see ripples on the water and watch the shadows dance. 
Then she's diving down and you're looking through a glass. 
Like a one way mirror, her reflection's far below. 
Where she was, she isn't now.
That's all you really know.

Two swimmers in the water, one of silver, one of gold. 
One below the surface, one reaching for a hold. 
One floating freely, one tryin' not to drown. 
A dreamer with two faces, a dolphin and a clown.

If you think you'll hold her in a shallow pool, 
catch her in a waterfall, you're thinking like a fool.
She'll strike up the horizon, like a ship out to sea.
Leaving just illusions that look like memories.

She wears the water like a mask, a brand new suit of clothes.
A player on the stage, an actress no one knows. See her roll and tumble, 
falling like a clown. 
A swimmer in the water that flies to higher ground",She Rises Like the Dolphin

Countin' troubles 'stead of countin' sheep

Of dusty books and faded papers 
They tell a story I used to know 
And it was one that happened so long ago 

It's gone away in yesterday 
Now I find myself on the mountainside 
Where the rivers change direction 
Across the Great Divide 

Now, I heard the owl a-callin' 
Softly as the night was fallin' 
With a question and I replied 
But he's gone across the borderline 

He's gone away in yesterday 
Now I find myself on the mountainside 
Where the rivers change direction 
Across the Great Divide 

The finest hour that I have seen 
Is the one that comes between 
The edge of night and the break of day 
It's when the darkness rolls away 

And it's gone away in yesterday

Where the rivers change direction

Kate Wolf,"Gray-haired and flint-eyed, his sunburned face lined
Grandpa was a man of few words
He had a way of not wanting to say
Any more than he thought would be heard

The long years of living, day-to-day giving
Had carved out a map on his face
With little to lose, he’d learned how to choose
And his choices were easy to trace

He had the eyes of a painter
Heart of a maker of songs
His words fell like rain on the dry desert plain
Precious and so quickly gone

From a long line of teachers, white Baptist preachers
He was born with an Indian will
His quiet dark eyes, reading the light
As he rode in the low Osage hills

His school was the prairie, the sage, the wild berry
The quail, the wide open sky
The cottonwood thicket by the slow rolling river
The Redbud and the hot cattle drive

He had the eyes of a painter
Heart of a maker of songs
His words fell like rain on the dry desert plain
Precious and so quickly gone

There were days filled with thinking, nights with the drinking
For a lost love that raged like a storm
Oh, but how his eyes smiled, when he’d talk to a child
The rough hands so gentle and warm

His strong arms were brown, where the long sleeves
Rolled down, on his faded blue cotton shirt
When times got hard, he’d go out in the yard
And he'd cuss away some of his hurt

He had the eyes of a painter
Heart of a maker of songs
His words fell like rain on the dry desert plain
Precious and so quickly gone

Now the garden’s grown dusty, hand axe lies rusty
The door’s banging hard in the wind
Grandpa’s store is closed down, like most of the town
And it won’t be open again

And the big white car, sits out in the yard
Of the house he built solid and true
Oh, but I see his eyes, burning tonight
Like the stars in the sky he once knew

He had the eyes of a painter
Heart of a maker of songs
His words fell like rain on the dry desert plain
Precious and so quickly gone

His words fell like rain on the dry desert plain
Precious and so quickly gone

Kate Wolf,"When I was young my mamma told me
She said child take your time
Don't fall in love too quickly
Before you know the one
She held me round the shoulders
In a voice so soft and kind
She said love can make you happy
And love can rob you blind
Here in California fruit hangs heavy on the vines
There's no gold I thought I'd warn you
And the hills turn brown in the summertime
Now I will learn to love you
But I can't say when
This morning we were strangers
And tonight we're only friends
I'll take the time to know you
I'll take the time to see
There's nothing I won't show you
If you take your time with me 
Here in California fruit hangs heavy on the vines
There's no gold I thought I'd warn you
And the hills turn brown in the summertime


There's a old familiar story
An old familiar rhyme
To everything there is a season
To every purpose there's a time
A time to love and come together
A time when love longs for air ??
A time for questions we can't answer
Though we ask them just the same
Here in California fruit hangs heavy on the vines
There's no gold I thought I'd warn you
And the hills turn brown in the summertime",Here in California
Kate Wolf,"It's an unfinished life
That I find lies before me
An open-ended dream
And I don't want to wake
I've crossed so many rivers
In search of crystal fountains
I've found the truest paths
Always lead through mountains
I've seen water on the sky
And fire burning on the lake

Chorus:
You said to me
I cannot make you happy
Like a wounded bird
You must find the strength to fly
Time can paint the tree tops
With colours of the rainbow
But you cannot find the end
No matter how you try

It's a journey with my soul
That I am taking
One that only goes
From the cradle to the grave
Going 'round in circles
Like painted dancing horses
Up and down we ride
On the wooden courses
And light from a lover's eyes
Is all that I can save

Chorus

So I'll take the day and run
Out across the open fields
Where the grass grows high
And the shadows fall
Where my eyes can see
All the colours in the air
So quiet that the wind
Whistles in my hair
And takes the rising dust
And carries it away

Chorus",Unfinished Life
Kate Wolf,"Kind friends all gathered 'round, there's something I would say:
That what brings us together here has blessed us all today.
Love has made a circle that holds us all inside.
Where strangers are as family, loneliness can't hide.

You must give yourself to love if love is what you're after;
Open up your hearts to the tears and laughter
And give yourself to love, give yourself to love.

I've walked these mountains in the rain and learned to love the wind;
I've been up before the sunrise to watch the day begin.
I've always knew I'd find you, though I never did know how;
Like sunshine on a cloudy day stand before me now.

So give yourself to love if love is what you're after;
Open up your hearts to the tears and laughter
And give yourself to love, give yourself to love.

Love is born in fire; it's planted like a seed.
Love can't give you everything, but it gives you what you need.
And love comes when you're ready, love comes when you're afraid;
It'll be your greatest teacher, the best friend you have made.

So give yourself to love if love is what you're after;
Open up your hearts to the tears and laughter
And give yourself to love, give yourself to love.

Give yourself to love if love is what you're after;
Open up your hearts to the tears and laughter
And give yourself to love, give yourself to love",Give Yourself to Love
Kate Wolf,"I like the way your sparkling earrings lay,
Against your skin, it's so brown
And I wanna sleep with you
In the desert tonight
With a billion stars all around
'Cause I gotta peaceful easy feeling
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing on the
Ground

And I found out a long time ago
What a woman can do to your soul
Ah, but she can't take you anyway

You don't already know how to go
And I gotta peaceful, easy feeling
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing on the ground

I get this feeling I may know you
As a lover and a friend
But this voice keeps whispering
In my other ear, tells me

I may never see you again
'Cause I get a peaceful, easy feeling
And I know you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing on the ground
'Cause I'm already standing
On the ground
Ooo, ooo",Peaceful Easy Feeling
Kate Wolf,"A Lilac bush and an Apple tree
Were standing in the woods
Out on the hill above the town, 
Where once a farmhouse stood.

In the winter the leaves are bare
And no one sees the signs
Of a house that stood and a garden that grew
And life in another time.

One Spring when the buds came bursting forth
And grass grew on the land, 
The Lilac spoke to the Apple tree
As only an old friend can.

Do you think, said the Lilac, this might be the year
When someone will build here once more?
Here by the cellar, still open and deep, 
There's room for new walls and a floor.

Oh, no, said the Apple, there are so few
Who come here on the mountain this way
And when they do, they don't often see
Why we're growing here, so far away.

A long time ago we were planted by hands
That worked in the mines and the mills
When the country was young and the people who came
Built their homes in the hills.

But now there are cities, the roads have come
And no one lives here today
And the only signs of the farms in the hills
Are the things not carried away

Broken dishes, piles of boards, 
A tin plate, an old leather shoe.
And an Apple tree still bending down
And a Lilac where a garden once grew.",The Lilac and the Apple
Kate Wolf,"Love is but a song we sing,
Hear a way we die.
You can make the mountains ring,
Hear the angels cry.
Tho' the dove is on the wing
You need not know why.

Hey, people now,
Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

Some will come and some will go,
We shall surely pass.
When the wind that left us here,
Returns for us at last.
We are but a moment's sunlight,
Fading on the grass.

Hey, people now,
Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

Hey, people now,
Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

If you hear the song I'm singing,
You will understand.
You hold the key to love and fear,
All in your trembling hand.
One key unlocks them both, you know,
It's at your command.",Let's Get Together
Kate Wolf,"Gentle warrior
With your heart like gold and a rainbow in your eyes
Brave companion
Do you see a world shining in the sky?
With your body dancing like an arrow
Spreading joy beneath your feet
And your hands they wave like tall grass
In the wind as you speak

With the shyness of a small child
And the wisdom of a saint
I tell ya now
There is no reason to be afraid

Brother warrior
There are none of us who walk this path alone
Spirit healer is the only life that we have ever known
I see your smile in the sunlight
I hear your song in the rain
And I hold you here inside me
Feel your love and know your pain

At this time when the earth is waking
To the dawn of another age
I tell ya now
There is no reason to be afraid

We are crying for a vision
That all living things can share
And those who care
Are with us everywhere",Brother Warrior
Kate Wolf,"Just an old house with the roof fallin' in
Standin' on the edge of the field
Watching the crops grow like its always done before
Nobody lives here anymore

The sun's going down on the Carolina pines
I'm a long way from home
I miss that love of mine broken windows empty doors
Nobody lives here anymore

Old memories come whistling like the wind
Through the walls and the cracked window panes
And the grass is growing high around the kitchen door
Nobody lives here anymore

Once there were children and a few hired hands
A hard working woman and a bone tired man
Now that old sun steals across a dusty floor
Nobody lives here anymore

",Carolina Pines
Kate Wolf,"By the banks of the river
Where the willows hang down
And the wild birds all warble
With their high, lonesome sound
Down in some hollow
Where the waters run cold
It was there I first listened
To the lies that you told.
If the young men were blackbirds
The young men were thrushes
I would lay by the hours
In the cold rainy marshes
If the young men were squirrels
With high bushy tails
I'd fill up my shotgun
With rock salt and nails.
Now I lie in my bed
And I see your sweet face
The past I remember time cannot erase
The letters you wrote me
Were written in shame
And I know that your conscience
Echoes my name.
Lord I lie here each night
All alone and I weep
Nothing ain't worse
Than a night without sleep
I walk out alone under the sky
Too empty to sing too lonesome to cry
If the ladies were blackbirds
And the young men were thrushes
I'd lie there for hours
In the cold, rainy marshes
If the ladies were squirrels
With high bushy tails
I'd fill up my shotgun
With rock salt and nails
I'd fill up my shotgun
With rock salt and nails","Rock, Salt and Nails"

Katel,"J'ai bâti des endroits calmes
Des lacunes closes où crustacée
Carapatée dans mes remises
J'observe les fonds agités

Soucieuse de vivre en bonne entente
Avec mes voisins enclavés
J'ai ensablé ma carapace
Pour feindre le mollusque poulpé

Ici marinent mes idées
Contre le silence de la mer
Et si je nage en profondeur
C'est qu'en surface on les enterre

Puis j'ai vidé ma dure coquille
Des mauvaises herbes qui me squattaient
Je n'ai plus concédé de place
Qu'au strict cercle d'initiés

Dans ma lacustre cathédrale
Je crée mes religiosités
J'échappe aux cuistres et aux rustres
Aux papas encapitainés

La tempête gronde chez les vagues
C'est à la poupe qu'on s'est rué
Mais c'est le grand mât qui castagne
Les figures de proues vont brûler

Moi je retourne dans ma cocagne
Je mets mes poupées sur mes yeux
Quand je serai grande je serai sirène
Puisqu'on m'a divisée en deux

Je ferai un tour dans la caverne
Pour y danser avec les bêtes
Quand je serai grande, j'y serai reine
Et on me coupera la tête",Carapace

On croisait dans les brumes
Nos bandes de gerfauts 
Qui rasaient le bitume
On claquait à grands bruits 
Le creux de vieux cylindres
Quand les dames alanguies 
Novices à la bas tringue
Paradaient aux abords 
Comme à la comédie 
Se joignaient à nos fasques
Pour faire quelques folies

On croyait pauvres fous
Humilier leurs époux
Tombés du haut des dunes
Au lit des ministères
Ces frivoles fortunes
Se juraient de nous plaire
Et là dans l'eau des lunes
Nos bouches en arrière
Noyés dans l'amertume

Où commenceraient nos guerres,

Où je chante, le cœur à la barre

Pour que je puisse goûter à des rédemptions crades

Ecrasés brusquement aux séances de salut
Edentés d'un seul coup, les sourires des pleureuses

Katelyn Tarver,"At the end of my street
That's where we all meet
Talk about nothin nowhere to go
You're into that scene
But inside I could scream
It's a desert where nothin can grow
I would stay here of I could
But I know it would do no good
Maybe someday you will understand

Something in me wants to reach with both hands
Go over the edge and see where I land
Something in me wants to know what's out there
It's something that I've gotta do
It's not you it's something in me

You're bathed in the light
Each night after night
Watching your life pass you by
I know you had your dreams
But now it just seems
You've settled for less why should I
I know you're scared that I'll get hurt
But don't you think it's so much worse
To give it up before you even try

Something in me wants to reach with both hands
Go over the edge and see where I land
Something in me wants to know what's out there
It's something that I've gotta do
It's not you it's something in me

If I listen to my voice
It leaves me no choice
I would stay here if I could
But I know it would do no good
Maybe someday you will understand

Something in me wants to reach with both hands
Go over the edge and see where I land
Something in me wants to know what's out there
It's something that I've gotta do
It's not you it's something in me

You got underneath my skin, I can't get you out
Why can't I hang on to my senses

Illogical, uncontrollable, impossible boy how can it be
What you do to me
It's so irresistible, unpredictable, unstoppable
And I can't help but fall
If this is what you call undeniable

Maybe I think too much I over analyze
My heart is feeling what my head wants to deny
What's done is done and I can't ever change it
I'm so far gone and I don't know how to explain it - it's so

Don't know what's on the way
But whatever it is I'll be ready
On your mark get set go
Here's the show and the road
But with you it's a load I can carry
And with each breath I would take it
Every moment gonna make it

It's a wonderful crazy
It's a beautiful out of control
Kinda scary amazing
But I don't really mind at all
It's like I'm falling, flying, laughing, crying
Hanging on and letting go
Cause my life' so wonderful crazy crazy

Some days get intense
And breakdown my defense
But I'm here and I'm not giving up
Gonna take in the sights
On the ride of my life
Living just to survive's not enough
So much love to discover
I don't need any other

All is well

There was a time not long ago
I was on the road to ruin
I was the master of my life
I didn't know what I was doing

But you came into my life so freely
An answered cry for help
Hush, please don't cry now,
All is well

It's the feeling of security
In the middle of the night
I can fade back into dreaming
And I know everything's gonna be alright

I take a free fall headlong
Deep into your spell
With my heart wide open
I cast away my shell

Safe at last in my lover's arms I'll never lose my hold
There's a word, an unspoken word, I will do as I'm told

It's the burning of my loves desire
That only you can quell
It's the feeling that I feel when,
All is well

There's a light that shines on me deep down in my soul
And I know that it's time for me to come in from the cold

We all grow up when we do

You can struggle for truth

Katey Sagal,"He ain't crazy, he ain't dumb
Don't call him lazy, he's the unfortunate one

Home of the brave, land of the free
Nobody's asking for what ain't theirs
Just their dignity 

Now she's angry, she worked all day
Rent is due, she don't have enough to pay
She once lived out the American dream
Said ""nothin' bad's ever gonna happen to me""
And like so many stones that we throw away
She's got nothin' left for a rainy day

Oh, every mother's son, every single one
Has the right to dignity
Oh, every shattered dream, every soul in need
Has the right to dignity
What you gonna do with your babies
Home of the brave, land of the free
Nobody's asking for what ain't theirs
Just their dignity 

And I call it a human thing
And it comes from inside
Oh yes it's this human thing
To want to be warm in the night

Has the right to dignity
Oh, every shattered dream, every soul in need

Katey Sagal,"Been waking up in the middle of the night
Been wondering where I belong
I look at you - we used to be so right
But now baby something's wrong

I'm not sure I wanna find the words
Are some things better left unsaid
Maybe we'll just go on and fool ourselves
Turn out the lights and go back to bed

Please keep on talking
And tell me one more time
How love will always find us
And I'll make believe
And the hurt won't show
And I'll act like I don't know

Not a word did I say
In the arms of somebody new
It took my breath away
I thought time had healed the pain

If she gives you love
Like I never could
And takes you where we could never go
I hope you're happy
But I don't want to know
I don't want to know

No it's not jealousy
It's not that I want you back
What we had was so special to me
And I can't let go of that
I know we parted as friends
Excuse me if sometimes my heart doesn't understand

People coming from everywhere around
Everybody wants to see what's going down
Young girl she's playing catch-up with some cone man
While the ancients are just trying to breathe deep
We reach for shelter in the frozen arms of brotherhood

Where is my peace, where is my peace

Maybe if I wait a million years
Maybe if I dry these thousand tears
Maybe then I will see the point of this
To my body I give the gift of sun and light
With my spirit I will hold out my hand
To the angels of all creation I ask

Where is my peace, where is my peace
Where is my peace, where is my peace

How many roads to go, as long as the rivers flow
How many hills to climb, as long as the ocean's wide
How many words to say, as long as there's night and day

Hold on to your hopes and your dreams
Hold on to your love
You better hold on between the silver and the screen
Hold on to your love, to your love

That when I grew up I'd be secure

Of winter's breath
On my shoulder
I have got to start the healing

Things would turn out right
If you just behave and with God above
No one would ever leave
I've had some broken dreams
I'd just as soon forget
Waiting for the finer things
And promises unkept

Sometimes you win, sometimes you don't
That's how love goes
Sorrow runs deep, but the joy you will keep
That's how love goes
You get lost, you fall down, but still you find your way
That's how love goes
It goes where the wind blows

Take what you want live the good life
Sounded good to me
So I rode that wave, I was once so sure
Now I don't know what I need
Giving only the best of me
So sure of my designs
I looked for the safest bet
But the odds changed all the time

Sometimes you win, sometimes you don't
That's how love goes
You turn the page, you seem more your age
That's how love goes
You get lost, you fall down, but still you find your way
That's how love goes

Some people run away to find a new life
Some are gonna do what it takes to get thru the night
Afraid of standing still
When that's the only way

Sometimes you win, sometimes you don't
That's how love goes
Sorrow runs deep, but the joy you will keep

And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops

Will you be coming back home?

You lie to yourself, you lie to me
It seems like the truth is your worst enemy

I'm tired of the lonely days and the dark endless nights
It's taken some time 'cause I didn't know if I could ever let you go
You helped me figure it out, I'm better off alone

To the hope that someday you'll change
Then alone I'll wake to my own mistakes
That it's just a foolish game

I think it was the summertime
When I laid eyes on you
I didn't even know your name
Somehow we'd ended up in the same room
It never crossed my mind
I never saw you like that
I should've listened to my best friend
She knew we'd be a perfect match

It's a typical love story
We started out as friends
We met way back when
This is just a
Typical love story

The boy you never wanted just steals your heart
I never saw it coming 'till I fell so hard

(Oo, oo, oo)

I always made up some excuse
Saying that you weren't my type
Didn't wanna face the truth
Didn't wanna cross that line
'Till one day I saw you
Out the corner of my eye
You were flirting with some girl
And inside I thought I would die

It's a typical love story
We started out as friends
We met way back when
This is just a

The boy you never wanted just steals your heart

Can't believe it's happening
When I least expected
My prince under disguise
How you fooled me with those eyes
When I feel like I am blue
In your arms is where I knew
I am wrong
From the beginning we always belong

I can't believe, what I'm hearing myself say
And a porch light is my spotlight, so I play along with this lie

Did you even notice, the whole word shatter?
I just want to hold you, and tell you that I'm sorry
But I just keep it all inside

It's too much to take in

Sometimes I think you're avoiding me
I'm okay alone, but you've got something I need

Well, I've got a brand new pair of roller skates
You got a brand new key
I think that we should get together
And try them on to see

Well, I got a brand new pair of roller skates
You've got a brand new key",Brand New Key [*]
Katharine McPhee,"I kind of like this game
'Cause I've always played it safe
Let a bird out of its cage
It's gonna fly away
But the thrill of the unknown
Has lead me far away from home
I don't think I wanna go

Back to where I used to be
Like it was before
Every time you look at me
I want something more

I'm starting to shake
This perfect mistake
Could kill me any moment
But that's a chance I gotta take
I'm ready to fall
Break, or loose it all
We're dancing on a fault line
That's about to give way
But I think I'm gonna stay

I just wanna lie
Under burning skies
I have wished this moment
About a million times
Though it's dangerous, I know
Why should I say no?
I don't wanna have to go

Back to where I used to be
And like it was before
Every time you look at me
I want something more

Is just a breath away from heartache
And maybe I can wait

From this pain that is haunting me

Time will take all those scars you've been wearing
Please, don't tell me how I should be feeling

And there I go again

I don't need you coming around
One thing I should probably say

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair

Su una vecchia terrazza davanti al golfo di Surriento
Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce e ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assaie ma tanto bene sai
É una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare pensò alle notti lá in America
Ma erano solo le lampare e la bianca scia di un'elica
Sentì il dolore nella musica si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da un nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte
Guardò negli occhi la ragazza quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso uscì una lacrima e lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assaie, ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene, sai

Potenza della lirica, dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole confondono i pensieri
Così diventa tutto piccolo anche le nottie là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita come là scia di un'elica
Ma si è la vita che finisce ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice e ricominciò il suo canto

Sends me shivers

Was blind, but now I see.

T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come;
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead us home.

The Lord has promised good to me.
His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

When we've been here ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun.
",Amazing Grace (Tune: New Britain)
Katherine Jenkins,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me, all you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel

Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom, running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise 
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions, they're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you, and hope you love me
Don't cry for me, Argentina

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise 
Don't keep your distance
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true",Don't Cry For Me argentina
Katherine Jenkins,"I vow to thee my country, all earthly things above,
Entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love.
The love that asks no question, the love that stands the test,
That lays upon the altar the dearest and the best.
The love that never falters, the love that pays the price,
The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice.

And there'es another country I've heard of long ago,
Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know.
We may not count her armies, we may not see her king,
Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering.
And soul by soul and silently her shining bounds increase,
And her ways are ways of gentleness and all her paths are peace.
","I vow to thee, my country, for chorus & orchestra, H. 148"
Katherine Jenkins,"Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defences

Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendour
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your face away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close you eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange, new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to go
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the harmony which dreams alone can write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night",Music of the Night

Katherine Jenkins,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Under a dome of white jasmine
With the roses entwined together
On a river bank covered with flowers laughing in the morning

Gently floating on it's charming risings
On the river's current
On the shining waves
One hand reaches
Reaches for the bank
Where the spring sleeps and
The birds, the birds sing.

Lì tutti vivono in pace e onestà
Io sogno d'anime che sono sempre libere
