The Black Crowes,"A song ease your lonely
Let my words take your hand
Let me kiss your rose pedals for you and golden van
Let me point out the birds that fly only for you
And I will do anything that you want me to

[Chorus: x2]
Evergreen, evergreen, prettiest thing I'd ever seen
Come and steer away with me by the moonlight

When playing my garden come and dance in my rain
Come make love in the sunshine
Come lets share our pain
Come fly through this darkness
To be right by my side
And lets walk right through the door
Just to see whats inside

[Chorus: x2]

Show me the way
With the words that you say
With the light of love
And the light of your love

The Black Crowes,"Cut a rusty engine outta sawdust town
Better deal with the man who shook 'em all down so
Put a little grease on my axle now, yeah

I been from Antioch to Alcatraz
I can roll you one from an empty bag, but let's
Take it easy to avoid any snags

[Chorus]
Goodbye daughters of the revolution
Open your eyes and see your solution
Hallelujah come join the jubilee

Keep on runnin' through the gates of the city
To give up now would be such a pity
Don't you wanna see the ship go down with me?

Well,
I'll come to you hungry I'll come to you sore
I'll come round midnight to your back door
I'll drag my tail across your floor

Gonna run you ragged till you act your age
Gonna circle the wagons gonna storm your stage
If we all plead guilty will the charges be the same?

[Chorus]

Keep on runnin' through the gates of the city
To give up now would be such a pity
Don't you wanna see the ship go down with me?

I've been restless, baby, I've been wild
Caught up in a fever dream
Well, come on and save me, child

[Chorus]

Keep on runnin' through the gates of the city
To give up now would be such a pity
Don't you wanna see the ship go down with me?
Don't you wanna see the ship go down with me?
Don't you wanna see the ship go down with me?
Don't you wanna see the ship go down?
Don't you wanna see the ship go down?",Goodbye Daughters of the Revolution
The Black Crowes,"Dry bread on the table
Burn the mill salt the paper

[Chorus]
And its easy pick-ins on Locust Street
There's no place to hide
And you can't find love on Locust Street
But you can hear the sunrise crying
Can't you hear the sunrise crying
A song for you alone

Sad eyes, weeping willow
Black cat blues, blacked out window

[Chorus]

Just a glimpse of what love could be
Once a dream that I owned
What of many lonely longing souls
At least I'm not alone
Well at least I'm not alone

Ripe off the vine now lay rotten
Like a dead end street forever forgotten

[Chorus]

A song for you alone",Locust Street

It's all right brother
It's all right brothers
It's all right

It's all right sisters
It's all right brother

The wheel within the wheel
The water below the well
Keep the curtain drawn and the record on
And the curtain what do you say
Bring the bottle here
Make the real unreal
And lets go out and play

[Chorus]
It's all right sisters
It's all right brother
We all get down sometimes
Starting to show me
Starting to know me
Starting to feel the shine
Starting to let go
Now that we know
Time to move it on down the line

The exit marks the hex
That moves from next to next
Keep your head on tight
To make it through the night
You got to make a friend along the way
So cover up your tracks
And avoid a tax
And you'll live to love another day

[Chorus: x2]

Time to move it on down the line [x3]",Movin' on Down the Line
The Black Crowes,"Diamonds hold mirrors
And spoon it holds the stars
It's been a long time baby
Since I've seen the sun rise like this
Make a wish and call it maybe
And give me one more kiss
Oh, I like it like this
Oh, I like it like this

[Chorus]
Oh Josephine
You're dressed in black
Oh Josephine
Your eyes are blue
And I know now
There's no turning back

What will we do?

It's the dreaming through the come down
Still filling every tape
Come on and touch me baby
Before I turn to rust
I know there ain't no other
It's not a matter of trust
It's just sometimes love ain't enough
Oh, love ain't enough

[Chorus]

For a while I was kneeling in tears and powder
For as well I was strung out beyond my means
Well I lost that love while climbing down the ladder
Just looking for the song to set me free

Waited for redemption
No leaving love behind
You've got to know where you wanna be
It gets cold outside
It's too late to play it safe
So let's let it all ride
Yeah, let's let it all ride
Let it all ride!

[Chorus x2]",Oh Josephine
The Black Crowes,"On the first day of winter
I was set to leave
With the lost awe of true love in my eye
The wild frontier outlaws and thieves
To find me a mountain in the sky

There's gold in them hills
I heard the man cry
There's gold in them hills
For the taking
It's a one-way ticket down a river of lies
There's gold in them hills
If you make it

On the last day of spring
I first saw the sea
A poor boy with good luck on my side
Ready for riches
I rolled up my sleeve
And took my first step down my life

Had my wallet same old pocket
Sixteen dollars brand new shoes

Empty bottles sad turned daughters
What's a country boy to do

Tell dear mother that I miss her
But things are different now
There's nothing I can do
Your dark haired son is now long gone
Remember me
When you stare at the moon

I've broken my heart
Diamonds and gold
Through scandal through madness through cold
All I have left is this Grey in my beard
This mountain and the stories that I've told

There's gold in them hills
I heard the man cry
There's gold in them hills
For the taking
It's a one-way ticket down a river of lies
There's gold in them hills
If you make it 

There's gold in them hills [x3]
If you make it",There's Gold in Them Hills
The Black Crowes,"Go down go down you stranger
There's something waiting for you
Angels, dolls and honey
Temples and harpoons
You want your main line Jesus
Your want your diamond
You want to pull the trigger
And kill the autumn home

[Chorus]
So walk believer walk
Straight into the sun
Walk believer walk
Your word ain't ever done

Pray on pray on my brother
Nows the time for due
Black shadow come a creeping
Take the soul right out of you

Can you feel the demons puling
Can you hear the devils sing
Can you taste the poison in your mouth
Feel the weight of his chains

[Chorus: x4]",Walk Believer Walk
The Black Crowes,"[Chorus:]
Put forever in your mind
Let go of space and time
Yeah say it is we who see the deep
It is we that the less earn teeth

Do you even know this place
Nowhere is over
To find our way back to grace
Nowhere is nothing at all

Well I have come from a hurricane
A messenger that the temp is praying
Eyes full of sun, hands full of sea
Anyone with the night just to help me see

[Chorus:]

I said nowhere is nothing at all
I said nowhere is nothing at all
I said nowhere is nothing at all
I said nowhere is nothing at all

Nowhere is nothing at all
Well I said nowhere nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
Nowhere is nothing at all
I said nowhere is nothing at all",Wee Who See the Deep
The Black Crowes,"[Chorus]
Whoa mule, whoa mule, we're dirty but were dreaming
Whoa mule, whoa mule, we'll both get there someday

All you ramblers, you silk tongue gamblers
Listen to my tale
It won't take long, to sing you my song
Full of trouble and despair
So fair thee well, you troubadours
Whose pockets have no lining
I can tell you that all pastures stay green
But you know that I'd be lying

[Chorus]

My own true love is a raven haired girl
Whose lives way back down the hollow
I take her by her lily white hair
And into the woods we wonder
Her daddy was a river man
As mad as a hatter
Her mama she's as soft as snow
But that don't really matter

[Chorus]

Sometimes a road is rocky and hard
Full of dangers unrelenting
Just take great care to follow your stars
Let the good times come a plenty

[Chorus: x2]",Whoa Mule
The Black Crowes,"Off the tracks lost the rail
Trying to squeeze a little blood out a rusty nail
When you're thirsty, thirsty
Behind your eyes you feel the burn
As your down hill ride takes a solid turn from the lonely, lonely

[Chorus]
Now don't look back
My wounded bird
There's nothing for you're here
Need no wing just set your mind to fly

It's like it been a long time in an empty bed
In an empty room with an empty head full of nothing
And all you got left is your skin and your teeth
And the red in your eye your six feet deep to get ready yeah

[Chorus]

The waiting is over
So lets roll in the clover
Time for a head full of stars
Lets pull back the curtain
I know one thing for certain
Well we don't have very long

[Chorus]

Set your mind to fly [x7]",Wounded Bird
The Black Crowes,"Be struck by the arrow of weakness
On the gilded path to forgiveness
Find my way home when the morning comes
To stay your friend when it's all said and done

Simple as lightning starting wild fire
Just down from a trip off my high wire
Just coming home to walk my own floors
Just coming home to the one I adore

Appaloosa
Appaloosa
Appaloosa
Take me home
Where I can dream my days away

You took your tears back to the river
Knowing all the while there'd be more later
So it goes in a rainy day town
Come on and won'cha let me lay you down

Sometimes the sun makes beggars believers
And sometimes a shrine is built to deceive her
In between let oblivion ring
Whoa let me hear all you sad angels sing

Appaloosa

Take me home
Where I can dream my days away

The Black Crowes,"Earthbound wingless dream, child born to necessity
Tied to crimson velvet wings (she flies)
New moon midnight star, medicine is in the jar
Headful of going far, (she flies)
Lost out on the dream road
Looking for a keyhole
Never try to fight it, feeling right inside it

Low country blushing bride, blind to the ways of time
Clear crystal burning mind, (she flies)
Falling through liquid air with music everywhere
Stone faces silent stare, (she flies)
The old guard on the hill can feel the chill
Deep into the freeze of those who don't believe

[Chorus]
Been a long time (Waiting on love) 
Been a long time (Waiting on love) 
Been a long time (Waiting on love) 
Been a long time (Waiting on love)

Her word is always true, (she flies)
Step into the new day right over the old way
We are the horizon see our future smilin'

The Black Crowes,"Well there's a ruckus on the levee
Unruly crowd on the courthouse steps
And if I make it till Sunday
I'm sho'nuff gonna ask the good Lord for help
With a mouthful of salt I try to explain
If money was sand I couldn't hold one grain
I feel like a thief that knows he's been framed
For leaving the watch but stealing the chain

Good morning, captain
I wish there was another way
But my baby is wantin'
Me to roll around in her bed all day

Well the late nights got me reeling
Spillin' out the bottle right into the next day
Got a funny little feeling gonna be like this until my dying day
There's mud in my eye but I can still see
Everybody in town is tryin' to murder me
If they don't get me s'pose the hangman will
I better think twice about making this deal

Good morning, captain
I wish there was another way
But my baby is wantin'
Me to roll around in her bed all day

Magnolia, magnolia
Let me rest under the shade of your leaves

Good morning, captain
I wish there was another way
But my baby is wantin'
Me to roll around in her bed all day

The Black Crowes,"Another week in the drivers seat
With your feet up on the dashboard
Rain it kept a steady beat
As I watch you dream of Houston

How you're never going back
Yes sir that's a fact
As you wave your cowboy hat
And sang the Yellow Rose of Texas

Just trying to make high ground
Has kept us on the run
There's no crime in toeing the line
Because vultures aren't on us baby
And we're gonna walk in the sun

I might dream about Houston
But Houston don't dream about me
If I can keep it between the lines
Who knows what will be

Loose change days and motel nights
Day old coffee dollar post cards
State troopers flashing lights
As we listen to the thunder

As we talked about our past
So we see our coming future
You tell me you know love can last
While staring out the window

Just lookin' for
A place to hide
A place to ease our minds
A place away from yesterday
Close to tomorrow
Away from the sorrows
Of living other people's time

I might dream about Houston
But Houston don't dream about me
If I can keep it between the lines
Who knows what will be

How long, how long
Til we feel a change
How long, how long
Will the skies be gray
How long, how long
Will it be this way
How long, how long
Will she stay?

I might dream about Houston
But Houston don't dream about me
If I can keep it between the lines
Who knows what will be

The Black Crowes,"Rust on my pickups
And blood on the stage
Seeds in the ashtray
And coke on the blade
N-Y-C delivers that's a guarantee
The only thing that keep the day from me

Line at the bathroom
Line at the bar
Take it outside and do the rest in the car
Our candy baby's in a bright light fright
Rock and roll rat race everybody's uptight

Ain't your saint, ain't your enemy
I'm a long shadow on the highway
I know this ain't how it's supposed to be
Baby I ain't hiding

Stayed on the dance floor cause you can't find the door
Can't run out cause there is always more
Keep on rocking cause it's not even four
Turn up the bass until your ears get sore

Ain't your saint, ain't your enemy

Troubled and tired.

The Black Crowes,"Up high in a mansion
On a mountain of jagged rock
Behind two iron doors
So heavy they need no lock

Is the last place that love lives
Where the sad woman cries
Is the last place that love lives
Behind your eyes

You hold up your finger
And you place it to my lips
And you tell me that anger
Can never get rid of this

Is the last place that love lives
Where the sad woman cries
Is the last place that love lives
Behind your eyes

Never blind to misfortune
Never deaf to the sorrowful moan
Set adrift on an ocean
Until I find that peaceful shore

Is the last place that love lives

Sold your soul for delusions of beauty and courage
While young at heart is a nice place to start
Can the truth hold all this baggage

So tell all you foes
Because my friends know
That your white flag ain't no sign for surrender
And those books that you've read have gone straight to your head
And made you the great pretender

I've heard that it's good to think before you speak
Though I've heard that it's good to bathe once a week

So tell me how it feels it if even seems real

Are they surprised by what we see?
Like the tables and the tides turn
back on my bed the emperor worn
Is that enough for me, could it be?

Eat like a king, to poke fun at clergy
To talk like dirt
To love you like tar

While you pull your hair out
I buy the drinks at the bar

Not a shred of clothing, yet I feel no cold
The woods envelope my soul
Perception multiplies
My senses heighten to extremes

My heart beat ever increasing
The only sound aside from the wailing of the wind through the trees

I know no fear
Boundaries of mortal human flesh have abandoned me as I am renewed
I dreamt of such a mutation for countless winter nights
My essence became that of a beast
I gracefully cut through the forest
Free of my former husk
Unfettered by the hindrances of past

To quench my maw with shreds of virgin flesh
To tear apart he who I once was
To rid the world of his feeble lies

Finding my way back home to stalk amongst the feeble mortals

Our lord has birthed the perfect evil unto this fragile earth
The sands of time now weigh against you
Pounding your weathered backs
Impending dread is cast upon you to swallow whole your faith

To thrust my fingers deep inside!

The ones whose souls will never rest in peace!

To join this frrrragile being who sleeps below 
The reflection of a razor reveals the moon, so perfectly 
Along my impatient veins its steel does/doth graze

Let us dance skeletally,
The chill of the autumn is stirring in me.
Let us rape, let us murder,
A night to sate thine perverted desires,
A night on which to watch them die,
To see the life whisked from the inside.
A night so black as Satan's hide,
When we ghouls do come alive,
When the masks of mockery shall disguise our wicked eyes.
To the death of all,
Celebrate the empty breath of fall.

Embrace ye the brown leafed vertigo,
For this undead night we have sold our souls.
Hoist ye this black flag of blasphemy,
Lift high this emblem of hate,
Return the jackolanterns smile on this holiday,
For the defiled shed the thorned binds of Christ's denial,
And son let the devil in,
Cultus diabolous,
Laus ut flamma,
Cultus obscurum,
Amplexus fatum.
Rejoice now ye hellions of Earth,
A glimpse of a future not far,
When the dark one is said to return,
Blackening this planet with ire.

Let us rape,
Let us murder,
A night to sate thine perverted desires.
A thrill that cannot be quantified,
To warm one's hands upon arson's fires.
May the spoils of this evening rot our teeth to the gums,
May the treats of our enemies sever their lying tongues.

Perversion of your sanctity
I’ve framed the scene for forced pornography’s throes, you’ll see

A complete jealousy of the recently dead

Have you ever tasted it?
Metallic barrel placed in it?
Do you possess the gall to pain all those in life you’ve touched?

Failure, I renounce our tenure
This venture has drained me
I ask thee grant self murder’s bliss
My conscience has begged me to end this horrendousness
Wrap rope so tightly ‘round my neck and twist

Suicide be my guide
The only thing I will get right in this life
My appeal shall not be denied
My place - now secured
My home - the other side

I never belonged here
I never did ask if I could join this world collapsed
A hell hath awakened and now I choose sleep
So let this razor get the better of me

Suicide be my light
The only wrong I stand to right in this life
To the ear of the Reaper confide
His blade offers mercy
May it tear me wide

Terrified of suicide but desiring death as well?

I pray the lord my feeble soul to take

Second adjust my bust that really sound fly
Third gain the zone, the washa has arrived
Fourth keep my mind and my song online

Equipped with all cultures, a piece of color blind
We keep it on the positive 'cause it is hard to find

Yo son, whatcha think about those Peas, though?
Yo, yo, I don't know, them dudes just be on stage, dancin' and stuff...
They on some old Las Vegas bullshit
They move too much, man
I can't take them fools seriously
I mean, they ain't talk about no 6-4, no Impalas
They ain't shootin' nobody (Shootin' nobody)
They ain't talkin' about clothes
You know what I'm saying?

Yo, my man, I got a plan to do it all (What kind of plan you got)
I got a plan that none of y'all ever
Talked about 'cause underground niggas don't be thinking
I'm going kinda nino like Lincoln
How can you make moves when you're always strapped under
I plan to read the scriptures, tell you more about the thunder
I wonder what really makes the world go round
Not thugs, 'cause thugs go 'round the brain of a brother's down
You be in it for a quick blink
But when you start to sink
You be deeper than you was
When you should've stop to think
About your consequence your actions don't make lots of sense
Brothers use the wicked life 'cause of lack of confidence
The devil jacked you for your sense now
You can't pay your rent and
That's no accident, you let us slip so we win
The rest of your development
You should've took time to prevent
The compiscation of your monument
Now ya, wash up, and a nobody
No one blame but your body
You livin' life, had thick and uneasy
You chose to be involved with no deals and crisis
In a hole 'cause of lust and greed
Your mind held captive and unable to exceed
Come out and follow the Peas, we give you what you need
We proceed to give you, what (What, what)

And you proce-e-e-e-e-e-e-ed
On fiendin' on what you need
(We give you what you need) -- [3x]

Yo, everybody's goal is to win
But others getting caught up within the line of commiting sins
And everybody seems to wanna rule
It's so ridicule we gotta find the right cure
We approach to penetrate equivalent and strong
To wash out individual with evil forms
Conquering battles in these fields of greed
Dark faces all around me makes it hard for me to see
Who's got my back and who will backstab
I'm ready for foes and hoes who tries to grab
My currency, if I ain't got none
The Crip to runs to the ones who got some
The war billows to those who makes action
The main caption is to bring satisfaction
If you like that contend you see
How you suppose to call yourself a real MC

So what's the definition of a true MC
(Someone who rocks swell and put my soul at ease)
Lyrics went entertaining capability
(Now that's the realest, see, all around 360 degrees)

Hey, witness grief through startin' material
You are blinded by lights, had an ego ratio
God bless you with the gift of only show
Business but you a careless professional
Is where your failing will show
Over indos and end only cash flows
Makin' it big, but yet, you never know
You will pay in your dues bringin' on sorrow
Here today, easily gone tomorrow
Feel the pain and I never borrow
From another man, instead I'm making grand

Ain't no difficulty or complication

Celebrated the musical liberation
The Peas then demonstrated the demonstration
And you will feel the flush of relaxation
I'm a wax these and then get heavy rotation
I got you in bliss and ain't no aggravation
When you bump us, we bring the stimulation
So hurry up and get your daily fixation
But make sure that it's handled, it's a moderation
One dose should bring you to a limitation

Bump it in your hot Beamer 850 coupe
Cause I'm a inform y'all on what to do
Hop in your ride and drive down in your avenue
It's bumpin' in your barbeque and your venue
At a journey, feelin' that ease, is why I sent you

Vibration that's headed for your store
For a change, not bragging about close to more
Instead brain fusion, I lace you up confusion
Relax and feel the groove it's the solution

Manipulate the mind with hypnotical legislate,
We far from the fakes,
We never fake moves,
But jealous motherfuckers since the justice approves,(and talk shit)
And who the hell he be havin' a fit,

Ring around your throat that's made up of razor blades
Put the slice and let nice and easy humble days
On out, over, well known Casanova
Can I put on an army, quick to take it over
Nine on my niggas, count all my figures

Nowadays brothers are getting paid doing nothing
Reciting the same line with the lame rhymes
Frontin' rappers actin' like their pops' was Orville Redenbacher

We're currently located over the Los Angeles scene
While you see a lot of niggas perpetrating like they're kings
With this so-called God complex
But when I see they mind they only see checks
So let's get our heads together
Let's form a foul weather
Proclaim against perpetrators

Well said, Alligator
Our realm, no perpetrator
A society choose the elevator
Of success by identity cross-fader
Complex thinking they're really much greater
Plain raw, harness all, maybe rough radar
Tough enough to perpetrate, I talk to you later

But wait, what about that midget brains
Unable to see reality too unreal
I'm sealed with mind, body and soul
Connected together, we tougher than leather
We much more than you think we are
We are the product of our own environment repent
With equality, plus duality
And taken all kind of posibilities (...bilities)
I sing the song from the soul
Let it rise from the tone
Let it rhythmically grow
Into it's own life
Let it become you
Then you become it
Once you become it everything will be infinite
Will be infinite, will be infinite, will be infinite...

We much more than you think we are
We are the product of our own environment repent
With equality, plus duality
And taken all kind of possibilities
I sing the song from the soul
Let it rise from the tone
Let it rhythmically grow
Into it's own life
Let it become you
Then you become it
Once you become it everything will be infinite
Will be infinite, will be infinite, will be infinite...

We much more than you think we are
We are the product of our on environment repent
With equality, plus duality
Mainly we represent positivity
I sing the song from the soul
Let it rise from the tone
Let it rhythmically grow
Into it's own life
Let it become you
Then you become it
Once you become it everything will be infinite
Will be infinite, will be infinite, will be infinite...",Positivity

Chaos and anger, just surely peakin'

Yo everybody's runnin', some of them are gunnin'
Avalanche the block, feel the anger, wantin' something

Secretly forming soldiers of you and they station

No more free education on former segregation
Politics about affirmative activation

So make a run for the border
Caught by the deporter
The immigration caught you but you got to leave your daughter
We are slowly being slaughtered

I don't see any grass growin'
Everything's conquered, we're running out of land

And goddamn yo, I'm runnin' out of clip

The critical perfectionist, rhythmic expressionist
We comin' deadly y'all ever in
And you'll be scared to pick the mic up again
Lyrically you on the level of Green, Eggs and Ham
Your best bet is fold 'cause I gots a bigger hand
Plus I'm steppin' like a monster so go-go and scram
You ain't experienced, you lucky if you ride the ambulance
Cause when you dealin' with fool Will is quite fatal
Shape-shiftin' rubbers like Play Dough
Your rhymes are anal and we ain't got no time to play
No games, put the mic down, boy, try not to say no
More than rhymes 'cause you duplicate like Kinkos
You're a carbon copy with the wrinkles
You actin' like a nigga that be rhymin' in a Pringle commercial
But you can wear it in rehearsal

Hard illustrator co-coordinate with ease
And duplicator crew, we put 'em all on freeze
Lock 'em in the cell, then throw away the keys
Another lost identity in disease
Entity with a so-called MC enemies
Will decrease when I step into your sceneries
Of course now you off course lost up in the source
I'm running out of time, this no time for no scrimmage
Aristorate the diamonds and replace it with the real image
Picture that, I know where I'm at
I know where I'm going and I'll be back
With a stronger impact lyrics be intact
Get you intoxicated when black attack
With the full-force pressure, hard to measure
On a rated scale whack MC's won't prevail
On a dream of makin' dream braggin' about infrared beams
But it seems all they really pullin' is pullin' them schemes
I take it back to the essence of hip-hop
Never will I stop with my beat-box

Can you feel it

Show you how we hypnotize
Angry foot is gonna tell you why
We built this bridge for the people in the park
We built this bridge for the dummies in the dark
And we built this bridge for the children in the light
We built this bridge for the skeezers with sight

Because the topics that them talk about has got me annoyed
You see I heard it all before, there's no need to repeat it
The forms I vacated, might as well delete it
Put your program in and open a new file
You shoulda took your record advance and bought a style
We the only crew that came original
While a lot of other brothers just mimic the pile
The pile that's only designed for pop charts
That contradicts thought, that's the reason we brought
It back 'cause honestly it lacks
Talent and creativity, in fact
These are symptoms to somethin that's whack
And your system senseless to witness that

Every place got a ghetto this is my version
Check it out,
Listen closely yo, I got a story to tell
A version of my ghetto where life felt for real
Some would call it hell but to me it was heaven
God gave me the grace, amazin' ways of living
How would you feel if you had to catch your meal?
Build a hut to live and to eat and chill in.
Having to pump the water outta the ground
The way we put it down utilizing what is around
Like land for farming, river for fishing
Everyone helpin' each other whenever they can
We makin' it happen, from nothin' to somethin'
That's how we be survivin' back in my homeland

[Chorus]

Yo, its been a while but,
I been back home to my homeland, (check it out) to see what's going on
Man it feels good to be back at home
And it's been a decade, on the journey all alone
I was fourteen when I first left Philippines
I've been away half my life, but it felt like a day
To be next to my mom with her home cooked meal
Meant I felt complete, my emotions I feel!
Now life has changed for me in the U.S
But back at home man, life was a mess
I guess sometimes life's stresses gets you down
On your knees, oh brother I wish I could have helped you out

Turn around and bitch slap somebody
But I ain't goin' out bro 
(No, no, no)
I ain't givin' into it
(No, no, no)
Anxiety bashed my mind in
Terrorizing my soul like Bin Laden
But I ain't fallin' down bro
(No, no, no)
I ain't givin in to it
(No, no, no)
Shackled in chains
My soul feels stained
I can't explain 
Got a itch on my brain
Lately my whole brain
Lately my whole aim is to maintain
And regain control of my mainframe
My blood's boilin' it's beatin' out propane
My train of thoughts more like a runaway train
I'm in a fast car drivin' in the fast lane
In the rain and I might just hydroplane

[Chorus:]
I don't fear none of my enemies
And I don't fear bullets from uzi's
I've been dealin' with somethin' that's worse then these
That'll make ya' fall to your knees
And that's the...

Anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoia's brought me to my knees
Lord please, please, please
Take away my anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoia's brought me to my knees
Lord please, please, please
Take away my anxiety

My head keeps runnin' away my brother
The only thing makin' me stay my brother
But I won't give into it bro (No, no, no)
Gotta get myself back now
God I can't let my mind be trapped by enemies
My own
Got's to find my inner wealth
Grasp a hold of my thoughts 
I can't get lost
I can't give into it now (No, no, no)
Emotions are trapped on lock
Got my brain stuck
Going through the motions 
Only I know what's up 
I'm filled up with pain tryin' to gain my sanity 
Everywhere I turn it's embedded in front of me
Nowhere to go gotta shake this anxiety
Got me feelin' strange
Paranoia took over me
And it's weighin' me down 
And I can't run any longer
Knees to the ground

Yo, every place has a ghetto
This is my version of it
Check it out
Listen closely all I got a story to tell
Version of my ghetto when life felt for real
Some would call it hell, to me it was heaven
God gave me the grace amazing ways of living
How would you feel if you had to catch a meal
To live to eat to chill and
Havin' to pump the water out of the ground
The way we put it down utilizing what's around
Like land for farm and river for fish
Everyone help each other whenever they can
We makin' it happen, nothing to something
We be surviving back in the homeland

It's been a while but
I been back to my home, to my homeland
And this be what's going on
Man it feels good to be back at home (back at home)
It's been a decade and a journey all along
I was fourteen when I first left Philippines
Been away half my life and it felt like a dream
To be next to my mom with her home cooked meal
Man I felt complete, my emotions I feel
Now life has changed for me in the U.S.
But back at home man, life was a mess
I guess sometimes the life stresses get you down
On your knees
Oh brother wish I could have helped you out
Help me...

Call your friends and call your cousins
Cause I know you got dozens of them
Marias, Elizabeth, Sonias, and Blancas
When I see you, you can get boned if you want to
Yo quiero and I'm sincero
If you never had an eechee 
Let me be your primo
We could hit the channel, we can dance the bolero
Have a shopping spree and you can spend my dinero but
I wish you was more like J. Lo 'cause 
Love don't cost a thing
So won't you let this king
Love the queen of Argentina 
Girl you know you know what I mean
Cause I like them

Que on da quieres con mi
Mira mucha cha esto para ti
Latina chichana por mi
Mas finas me gustan asi
Mira a, mira a mami
Esperate, esperate, esperate aqui 
We could connect and act humanly 
Indulge in animalistic swing
We could have conversation or 
Sexual relation or 
We can explore find out more about 
Things we've done before
Whether it be kinky thoughts
I'm gon' make your chonies drop
Watch mister shorty rock I'll rock your sticky spot
Hombre lumbre known to make it hot 
I'll make you drip drop
They call me Cum-a-lot
I like 'em

You're a brown skin mama
A yo mama sana wanna take you to Havana
We could get down every day of the semana
Dance to the music and follow the guitara
Come on...
Dame un mento y lo bevo con un beso
Take you to Phillip-pines
Then you don't have to spend a peso
We got connections like a novel to a reader
I can relate 'cause Latin girls look Filipina
Check your history there's no mystery between us
Destiny made it possible to be us
I know about your culture 'cause it's mixed with mine
We go together well just like beats and rhymes
Tequilas and limes
So let's combine
And I'll say it one more time 
I like them...

And freakin c's they all leave frantically
But our intentions are to be friendly
But they frighten when we start the free stylin' frenzy

The odours so contagious that it shows up in your dreams
Man you can pick me out like food in between
Your two front teeth 'cause you be like in the streets

Shut up your on the right
To left there
If you don't wanna take it then I'll take your dare
Take you to a place where I know your scared

Medioca up cess pit up
With medioca talents

It don't take rocket science to sell ballads
We're gonna defeat the defined
Get in a line and form more lines

Four minute stuff for freestyling

He was fooling me once before
But I tell you there's no fooling me twice no more
'Cause when I open up my third eye, third eye
Gotta get away wit' murder, wit' murder
He was fooling me once before
But I tell you there's no fooling me twice no more
So stop your oppression, oppression
Check it out I got a question, a question

Bush is Pinnochio, Pinnochio
Who the Hell is Gepetto, Gepetto?
Beware of Gepetto

'Cause he got knives and clips and a dagger that's shit with two crucifix
And he's got ya back won't flinch if ya two brother has an at Christmas
Welcome to the valley of the beast where they sing in harmony where I speak no peace
Keepin' an eye on a fella your cheddar, things that ain't really for the better
I could point out odd behaviour to keep your meal from the poisonous flavour
Then would you call, I can't say let me make your mind so you're in the door danger
He can sell sand to Iran
Ice to an Eskimo
Water to a dam
He can put a killer up for sale
The one who taught him how to stab

He was fooling me once before
But I tell you he ain't fooling me twice no more
'Cause when I open up my third eye, third eye
Gotta get away wit' murder, wit' murder
Know what I'm saying?

Can't fool me again
I'm here to games to late
I know your kind
Don't fall down again
Won't trip on games you like
I know your kind

You can fool me once (no no)
But you can't fool me two times (no no)
'Cause I got three eyes (yeah yeah)
One up from the left side (yeah yeah)
The other from the right side (yeah yeah)
One eye on the inside (yeah yeah)
And I can see you outside (no no)
Trying to come in

Trying to be a lady
I think I'm going crazy

Girl me and you is just fine, you know
We wine and dine did them things 
That couples do when in love, you know
Walks on the beach and stuff, you know
Things that lovers say and do
I love you boo, I love you too
I miss you a lot, I miss you more
That's why I flew you out when we was on tour
But something got out of hand
You start yellin', while I was with friends
Even though I had legitimate reasons, bull shit
You know I have to make the dividends, bull shit
How could you turn private eyes
That's why you don't believe my lies and quick today
 
[Chorus]
 
Why does emotion have to move so fast
Love is progress if you can make it last
Why is it that you just lose control 
Every time you agree on takin' it slow
So why do things got to be so damn tough
‘Cause fools in lust could never get enough love
Showin' the love that you be givin'
Changing your livin' for another transition
But less submission tryin' to get you to listen
Being mad has become a tradition
You yell, I yell everybody yell
Got neighbors across the street sayin'
Who the hell, what the hell's goin' down
Too much of the bickering, killing the sound

Girl our love is dyin', why did you stop tryin'
I never been a quitta, but I do this for better
Believe me I will do betta
Let's forget the past and start this new plan
Why, 'cause it's the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream
Girl I know you tired of the things I say
You're damn right 'cause I heard them 
Lame dame excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing, no it ain't
That was a different thing, no it ain't
That was a different thing
It was the same damn thing 
Same ass excuses, boy you useless

Get on stage and play the guitar
Make a little money, buy a fancy car
Big old house and an alligator
Just to match with them alligator shoes
He's a rich man so he's no longer singing the blues
He's singing songs about material things
And platinum rings and watches that go bling
But, diamonds don't bling in the dark
He a star now, but he ain't singing from the heart
Sooner or later he's just gonna fall apart
Cause his fans can't relate to his new found art
He ain't doing what he did from the start
And that's putting in some feeling and thought
He decided to live his life shallow
Cash in his love for material

And its gone, gone, going,
Gone, everything gone, give a damn,
Gone be the birds when they don't want to sing,
Gone people, up awkward with their things, gone.

You see yourself in the mirror
And you feel safe cause it looks familiar
But you afraid to open up your soul
Cause you don't really know, don't really know
Who is, the person that's deep within
Cause you are content with just being the name brand man
And you fail to see that its trivial
Insignificant, you addicted to material
I've seen your kind before
Your the type that thinks souls is sold in a store
Packaged up with incense sticks
With them vegetarian meals
To you that's righteous
You're fiction like books
You need to go out to life and look
Cause, what happens when they take your material
You already sold your soul and its

And its gone, gone, going,
Gone, everything gone, give a damn,
Gone be the birds when they don't want to sing,
Gone people, up awkward with their things, gone.

You say that time is money and money is time
So you got mind in your money and your money on your mind
But what about, that crime that you did to get paid
And what about, that bid, you can't take it to your brain
Why you on about those shoes you'll wear today
They'll do no good on the bridges you've walked along the way

All that money that you got gonna be gone
That gear that you rock gonna be gone
The house up on the hill gonna be gone
The gold, on your grill gonna be gone
The ice on your wrist gonna be gone
That nice little Miss gonna be gone
That whip that you roll gonna be gone
And what's worst is your soul will be gone

And I like this Will so I might get ill
On the mics somebody might get killed
So many damn rappers there's a stifle in heaven
My tongue is a weapon and plus when I bust all this stuff with Legend
When this Brooklyn MC come after you
You be running like I herd a carrel at Murdell Avenue
There we yattin' that ain't pretty that's the attitude
To be at Fight Club, even Brad had to crack a tooth
Stare into the sun, they try to copy
Let your eyes get used to the light because you gotta watch me
Sneak up on you like sake
My lyrics get out a split atom like Hiroshima and Nagasaki

It's the Apl.De.Ap in the lab with the rap
Demonstrate how we act, we attack any track
It's the Black Eyed Peas and we back with the facts
Start with the fat skills that rose in the past
We got it like how you know how to beast rocks
Entertain you, see you soon at the next spot
The crew got you bouncing and dropping your eye
Making you
Tss tsss tsss, I'm a roll with the hot
I'm a flow from the soul when you can't hold me back
Ke-ke-keep on keep on rolling the track

(One for all, one for all)

Let's start a union, calling every human
It's one for all and all for one
Let's live in unison, calling every citizen
It's one for all and all for one

We don't want war, can't take no more
It's drastic time for sure
We need a antidote and a cure
Coz do you really think Mohamed got a problem with Jehovah
We don't want war imagine if any prophet was alive
In current days amongst you and I
You think they'd view life like you and I do
Or would they sit and contemplate on why
Do we live this way, act and behave this way
We still live in primitive today
Coz the peace in the destination of war can't be the way
There's no way, so people, just be a woman, be a man
Realize that you can't change the world by changing yourself
And understand that we're all just the same
So when I count to three let's change

[Chorus]

Got no time for grand philosophy
I barely keep my head above the tide
I got this mortgage, got three kids at school
What you're saying is the truth, but really troubles me inside
I'd change the world if I could change my mind
If I could live beyond my fears
Exchanging unity for all my insecurity
Exchanging laughter for my tears

[Chorus]

I don't know, y'all, we in a real deposition
In the midst of all this negative condition
Divided by beliefs, different sink and religion
Why do we keep missing the point in our mission?
Why do we keep killing each other, what's the reason?
God made us all equal in his vision
I wish that I could make music as a religion
Then we could harmonize together in this mission
Listen, I know it's really hard to make changes
But two of us could help rearrange this curse
Utilizing all the power in our voices
Together we will unite and make the right choice
And fight for education, save the next generation
Come together as one
I don't understand why it's never been done
So let's change on the count of one

It takes one, just one
And then one follows the other one
And then another follows the other one
Next thing you know you got a billion
People doing some wonderful things
People doing some powerful things
Let's change and do some powerful things
Unity could be a wonderful thing

It's like that 'Cause I got it like that
And I got it like that also
Got a style that's way out like Bosto
You know I'm a crook a nigga like Chocko
Steady jumpin' around like it's heavy cargo
(Can I kick it?) Yup, really far though
From El Segundo to Toronto
I once hit a girl up in Chicago
But I'd never say who unless my name was Tanto
Yup, you know how the date rape go
'Cause we show the classic example
Now they know the Peas collect the dough
So they knocking on our door like we was Fargo
Yup, they see me in a Will.I.Am suit
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have the loot
And I don't smoke birds but I'm still real nice with the birds
So fuck (hey!) what you heard
'Cause we got it like that

[Chorus]

Talib, just hit 'em like that
I'm from the jungle, brother, and I got it like that
Yo, my life got me running through a maze like a white rat
I need a shot at ramming like my rap
It's like the yak is the fights that got me spillin' on the right track
And I like this Will so I might get ill
On the mics somebody might get killed
So many damn rappers there's a stifle in heaven
My tongue is a weapon and plus when I bust all this stuff with Legend
When this Brooklyn MC come after you
You be running like I herd a carrel at Murdell Avenue
There we yattin' that ain't pretty that's the attitude
To be at Fight Club, even Brad had to crack a too
Stare into the sun, they try to copy
Let your eyes get used to the light because you gotta watch me
Sneak up on you like sake
My lyrics get out a split atom like Hiroshima and Nagasaki

It's the Apl.De.Ap in the lab with the rap
Demonstrate how we act, we attack any track
It's the Black Eyed Peas and we back with the facts
Start with the fat skills that rose in the past
We got it like how you know how to beast rocks
Entertain you, see you soon at the next spot
The crew got you bouncing and dropping your eye
Making you
Tss tsss tsss, I'm a roll with the hot
I'm a flow from the soul when you can't hold me back
Ke-ke-keep on keep on rolling the track
I'm a simply simply always attach

Time to get the body live, body live moving
Party powerful flows, the way we rocking them show
The way we spittin' the rhymes and break it on down to the floor
Break, bounce, boogie and wiggle it
Do it, now, time to get into it

Syncopation the true school way 

(Chorus) 
I don't know what you came to do 
I came to drop funks on you 
Depends on their sonic sound 
But you know what? 
They don't want music 
They don't want music 
They just want (a boom, boom, boom boom boom)
(a boom, boom, boom boom boom)
They don't want music, they don't know how to use it 
They don't want music 
They don't want music 
They don't want music, they don't know how to use it 
The good back horn 
They don't want music, they don't know how to use it 
All they want is (a boom, boom, boom, boom, boom boom boom) 

Oh, la la aw wee wee 
Nowadays music is all about the beat 
The soul is caged no bits now free 
Unless the rhyme was rocked by me 
I got the balls to bang (baw ba-ba-baw, ba-ba-baw, ba-baw bang) 
Yeah, steady, just doing my thang 
(steady, just steady, just doing my own thang) 
I just do it (ha!) 
I just do it you know 
My momma said to do it you know 
So I'm a do it I know 
James Brown gave me the fluid 
That means a baby could do it 
The Peas will do it so 

Do it, do it, do it 
Get up on the stage and release my fluid 
Do my thing, do it through the music 
Phunkafied and therapeutic 

(Chorus) 

Wait a minute! 
You got to rock with the funk (if you're gonna have a good time) 
You got to rock with the funk (if you're gonna have a good time)
You got to roll with the funk (if you wanna have a good time) 
You got to roll with the funk (if you wanna have a good time)
You got to roll with the funk 
(you wanna be sweet and fine, hey! Hey! Hey!) 
Rock with the punk 
(if you gonna have a good time) 
You got to roll with the funk (if you wanna have a good time) 
You got to roll with the funk (if you wanna have a good time)
A woman that'll funk your horn (gimme that funky horn!) 
Play that funky horn now (gimme that funky horn) 
Gimme that funky horn now (gimme that funky horn) 
Hey! Hey! Hey! 

You got to roll with the funk (if you're gonna have a good time) 
You got to roll with the funk (if you're gonna have a good time) 
You got to dance with the funk (if you wanna be sweet and fine)

Gimme that funky horn (gimme that funky horn)

A break down, a break down, a break, get down 

Dance everybody move your body through the music 
Get it started, get into it 
Come on everybody do it 
You've got to dance through the music 
People doing what you're doing 
People grooving with the music 
You've got to roll with the funk 

Roll with your funk (if you're gonna have a good time) 
R-O-double-L keep rolling with the funk (if you're gonna have a good time) 
And roll! To a funky place 
I'm rolling (where?) 
To a to a to a funky funky place 
I'm rolling! To a funky place

Cross over the river the gold is waiting
And it's years since the colour I've seen
And it's no use just sitting and Lady Luck blaming
I'll pack up and make the break clean

Chorus

Farewell to the gold that never I found
Goodbye to the nuggets that somewhere abound
For it's only when dreaming that I see the gleaming
Down in the dark deep underground

Well it's nearly two years since I left my own mother
For adventure and gold by the pound
And with Jimmy the prospector, he was another
To the hill of Otago we were bound

Chorus

Well we worked the Cardona, dry valleys all over
Old Jimmy Williams and me
They were panning good dirt on the winding shot over
So we headed down there just to see

Chorus

We sluiced and we cradled for day after day
Making hardly enough to get by
Then a terrible flood swept poor Jimmy away
During six stormy days in July

",Farewell to the Gold
The Black Family,"


When I was young me father said to me, he said to me
He said never take advice when it comes for free
Cause you can have all the riches of the golden kind
But without the riches of your peace of mind
He said you won't make old bones
You won't make old bones
You won't make old bones you'll see

And as the old men sit and curse times slipping sand, slipping sand
I sit and I curse the time upon my hands
And the north wind blows like a song of the sea
The song that it carries comes quite plain to me
And says you won't make old bones .....

Now there is some folks make remarks and me fetals in frown, me fetals in frown
And says the only way you can get up is when they turn you down
Now everybody gives me the same advice
They said go sign up for the soldiers life or
You won't make old bones.......

So I went to the army like everybody told me to do, they told me to do
They said we'd love to make a soldier out of you
But before I put me name down on the line
Me fathers words came to me on time, he said
You won't make old bones ....

I said your guns and your drums are not for the likes of me, the likes of me
For me future it might look bleaker than bleak can be 
'Cause your talk of many owing much to few
When all that I wanted was a job to do, he said
You won't make old bones.......

So you people in power and position I tell you beware, I tell you beware
Of your tacts and your figures to tell you what went where 
'Cause your facts and your figures are the likes of me
And don't try and tell me how me life should be or
You won't make old bones....

Chorus

Oh the grace that true love holds
When hearts grow weary for time alone
You give it room and the warm to hold
And it'll always come home

True love is faithful all on it's own
Hearts know when they should fly alone
When the mind is rested and the hearts at ease
Two loves car give to each other's needs

Chorus

You can fool yourself and fool your dreams
But you can't fool your heart and you can't fool me
Love is a sailor sailing out to sea
One of these days you'll need a harbour in me

The light you seek just ain't in you today
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

So bang against the wall
But no one wants to see you fall down
The repetition kills you, the repetition kills you

So shout until you're here no more
But don't you ever ask yourself why
The repetition kills you, the repetition kills you
Oh, the repetition kills you

Dig yourself a bottomless hole
But don't you ever lose that light

Oh, the repetition kills you

This is a repetition of words
Dancing needs a repetition to work

The Black Ghosts,"I hope you know what your doing to me here
What your doing to me me here
Take some responsibility for your awareness of the levels on which we lie
I'd hate to believe only to find that I'm wrong
I'm wrong, I'm wrong, I'm wrong, I'm wrong
I'm wrong, I'm wrong, I'm wrong, I'm wrong
Don't act that way it's unbecoming just do what you do
Do what you do, do what you do, do what you do, do what you do

[Chorus]
I only know that your the one that always makes me feel it
It's nothing that you do lets just say it's just the way you are
If I could bottle what you got then life would be too perfect
I'll take it as it comes, any way you choose to give it

I challenge you to make a wrong move
A wrong move, a wrong move
Even when your acting the fool I cannot see through you
Through you, through you
The culmination of experience that I can only ever dream of
Is tearing your clothes off
How many lifetimes does it take to live in the present day
Live in the present day, live in the present day

[Chorus: x2]

Any way you choose to give it is sincerely a pleasure of mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
But don't think you can imitate the accent of fate
You've got to walk the line, walk the line
And I can think of a few things to say to make things right
But by the time I say them we will be in different light
Please appreciate the limits of the flesh
The spirit will not rest, will not be satisfied with anybody else

[Chorus: x2]",Anyway You Choose to Give It
The Black Ghosts,"Don't cry dear it ain't worth it
The rain on your face says it all
Don't cry dear it ain't worth it
Together we'll fall

Its true I won't believe its not
I feel it from my nose to my toes
I've got no time to figure out why
Before I say I do
Would you like to know what I am thinking?

Don't cry dear it ain't worth it
The rain on your face says it all
Don't cry dear it ain't worth it
Together we'll fall
And I would like to read your time
Highlight all the best bits
And you could sleep relentlessly
The power of the blind
You see what others can't see
At least that's what you tell me
What other reason could there be
For giving me your heart

Don't cry dear it ain't worth it
The rain on your face says it all
Don't cry dear it ain't worth it
Together we'll fall

Don't cry dear it ain't worth it
The rain on your face says it all
Don't cry dear it ain't worth it
Together we'll fall
Together we'll fall
Together we'll fall

Until it comes again

Until it comes again

It used to be it was all I want, my only care
Nothing else had a single part to play in my head
But now times led my mind astray, something was changed along the way
And no amount of tears can bring it back round til it comes again

So maybe we should pretend we're who we want to be
And forget who we really are and where we really be
Cause I've no time to start again but I won't to a bitter end
Can we keep it down til its back round til it comes
Again

Until it comes again, until it comes again

One more time to take the test to make it real
Or one more nail in this relationship make it
Impossible to heal
On the good ship hope we sail but the stars above say
The wind will fail
Can we keep afloat until its back round until it comes again

Until it comes again, until it comes again
Until it comes again, until it comes again",Don't Cry
The Black Ghosts,"Don't look now
'Cause it is coming for you, it is coming for you

You got to face the music, face the music,
Face the music, face the music?

No use hiding
'Cause it will break down the door, it will come through the wall
No good fighting
'Cause it is stronger than violence and harder than silence
No use lying
'Cause it will find the truth inside of you
No good crying
You got to face the music, face the music,
Face the music, face the music?

The Black Ghosts,"When the full moon turns white that's when I'll come home
I am going out to see what I can sow
And I don't know where I'll go
And I don't know what I'll see
But I'll try not to bring it back home with me

Like the morning sun your eyes will follow me
As you watch me wander, curse the powers that be
Cause all I want is here and now but its already been and gone
Our intentions always last that bit too long

Far far away, no voices sounding, no one around me and
You're still there
Far far away, no choices passing, no time confounds me and you're still there

In the full moons light I listen to the stream
And in between the silence hear you calling me
But I don't know where I am and I don't trust who I've been
And If I come home how will I ever leave",Full Moon [From Twilight]

She's conversations with the dead
Her footsteps trace my every move
Tell me why do I try to believe in a lie with you

I don't know what she did

I don't know what she said

Was it from your head? Cause I don't what I done to earn it
You could be right here, but would say what you mean or would you wait until I'm gone and you are lonely and you blame me for never understanding

And if this house was on fire would you tell me your desire
If my hands were round your throat would you tell me what I need to know
There must be some way, some way through this
If the sky was falling down would I see behind that frown
If cold steel touched your skin would you finally stop and let me in
Tell me baby how to get through this

And I done my time in the firing line
And I paid my dues hanging from a noose

The Black Ghosts,"A different time and place some new faces in my life is what I'm needing
I've grown old too fast and whole weeks pass without a single glimpse of meaning
And if disaster came at least there'd be a change
It's got to be better than sitting on this beach
I feel it there in front of me but in my present life
Of holding court with scheming money grabbers its
Getting further out of reach

So give me something new
Something to break through the normal
The things I have to do to keep myself from falling
Out of view
A different way to walk some new words to talk a
Climate change is what I'm needing

To make believe you were right.

I get all choked up inside
It's not only from the shame
It's like 10 different lovers died
Except you're still just a mile away
But there's nothing left to say

Don't leave us down and out again
Cause we might break instead of bend
I felt a little strain in the pouring rain
It washed away most everything

If I found another love
They must be forever true
Cause if someone breaks this heart
Your old man right here is through
Heaven just seems so far away
When there's nothing left to say

Don't leave us down and out again
Cause we might break instead of bend

And you're begging for me.
To take it easy on you, it's easier to

I stocked up on the ropes and the chains.
Can we keep things together now?
My mind is a broken shell and the last pieces
Are covering the bathroom...
Which way to the door.
I'm being chased by doctors.

Lucid and tranquil.
I've got my sanity.
Everything I ever was in mapped out on the whiteboard,
For everyone and anyone.
Someone please show me the door.

To sanctity my sanctuary
Is hidden deep inside from most.
And the secrets in the locket I wear,
They've been prescribed by doctors.
I need more.

Lucid and Tranquil.
I've got my sanity.
Everything I ever was is mapped out on the whiteboard,
For everyone and anyone.
Someone please show me the room.
Where I lost my innocence
Into a vacuum of paranoid secrecy.
Is everybody after me?
Someone please show me more,
Show me more...






",Lucid
The Black Maria,"Your beauty forced a change in me
Vivid and pure, it will always be haunting me
Burnt out by the temptress of old
Reborn, you're constantly challenging me

It never seemed so easy
For you to put me back together again
Lost in your eyes, the time flies by
Soon I'll be gone, left without a trace
I need you, to put me back together again

I ache for you constantly
Through my veins, I yearn for you hopelessly
And when it's my time to go
If all else fails, I desperately want you to know

It never seemed so easy
For you to put me back together again
Lost in your eyes, the time flies by
Soon I'll be gone, left without a trace
I need you, to put me back together again

Have I ever been so scared to be lost without a trace?
My heart broken in two, your memory erased
I'm so scared to be alone, you made me whole

I will always miss you
You will always have a place inside my heart

You make me whole
",Nothing Comes Easy but You
The Black Maria,"This love is a curse that's fading away
If I could only see your eyes
I swear, it may just change my mind

That this wasn't a dream, a diamond I can't see
When we had everything but time
Why did we let it pass us by?

The scent of your perfume left me consumed
And every promise that you made
Were they pure and true?

'Cause when I looked beyond the mattress
I saw you for what you really were
And from that moment you've been a stranger and I've been a fool

This love is a curse that's fading away
If I could only see your eyes
I swear, it may just change my mind

That this wasn't a dream, a diamond I can't see
When we had everything but time
Why did we let it pass us by?

There's a contract in a shoe box
And a ring that comes with a veil
You've shattered all my dreams, you're a liar too

With there being so many ghosts inside
My stored past that haunts me
Will I be the one destroyed after this?

Is it a sign of weakness
Can't do it anymore
I was drowning in the ocean
Now I'm floating to the shore

You left me to die there
Sinking in the core
This love is a sequence in a series of failures

This love is a curse that's fading away
If I could only see your eyes
I swear, it may just change my mind

That this wasn't a dream, a diamond I can't see
When we had everything but time
Why did we let it pass us by?

You left me to die there
Sinking in the core
This love is a sequence in a series of failures
",The Perilous Curse
The Black Maria,"


Your desperation
Your inspiration

When you finally became a mute,
While a sad song plays,
You lie helpless and lost,
Infected by the truth
That was fabricated by you.
Your image shattered in the eye of the storm.
We would never reach out to you.
How could you?

Your desperation to look like a victim
Is such a cop-out.
You're fooling yourself.
Your inspiration is your contradictions.
You've lost the concept of what's the real truth.

That it's you who is the thief.
Who should by humbled by the
Sheer size of your crimes.
We befriended you.
It was abuse.
There's no better time then the present time
To finally forget you.
How could you?

Your desperation to look like a victim
Is such a cop-out.
You're fooling yourself.
Your inspiration is your contradictions.
You've lost the concept
Of what's the real truth.

Close your eyes, and pretend that it's alright.
Do you feel it tonight?
Can you feel it tonight?
It's all crashing down.

Lately you know you've seen it.
The face, in the mirror never lies.
You're fading.
Fading...






",A Thief in the Ranks (Your Bike)
The Black Maria,"Give away all that you have inside
Every last moment that you're alive
Until your body is cold
Sure, as he peels away your skin
You see the monster is intent
To see this to the end

it would be easier to die...
Just easier sometimes
Because the light is a sober reminder of what he did
Your body can't get over it

life has been keeping you awake
Asphyxiated by the hate
And it never calms
Sew the aching in your veins
That no one ever sees
With the blade in the sheets

it would be easier to die...
Just easier sometimes
Because the light is a sober reminder of what he did
Your body can't get over it

it's over...it's over
Except the scars that last forever

it would be easier to die...
Just easier sometimes
Because the light is a sober reminder of what he did
Your body can't get over it

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh

That saved a wretch like me! 
I once was lost, but now am found.
Was blind but now I see.

In evil long I took delight,
Unawed by shame or fear
Till a new object met my sight,
And stopped my wild career.

3. I saw one hanging on a tree,
In agonies and blood
Who fixed his languid eyes on me,
As near his cross I stood.

4. Sure, ne’er until my latest breath,
Can I forget that look
It seemed to change me with his death,
Though not a word He spoke.

5. My conscience felt and owned the guilt,
And plunged me in despair
I saw my sins his blood had shed
And helped to nail Him there.

6.Alas, I knew not what I did,
But all my tears were vain;
Where could my trembling soul be hid,
For I the LORD had slain.

7. A second look He gave that said;
“I freely all forgive” !
This blood is for my ramson paid,
“I died that thou mayest live.”

8. Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear,
And Grace my fears relieved
How precious did that Grace appear,
The hour I first believed.

9. Through many dangers,toils and snares,
I have already come;
Tis Grace hath bro’t me safe thus far,
And Grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
His will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yes! when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the vail,
A life of joy and peace.

12. The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But GOD who called me here below,
Shall be forever mine.

Bright shining as the sun
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise,
Than when we first begun!",Amazing Grace

Such a sight for sore eyes
You're a suicide makeover
Plastic eyes

Looking through a numb skull
Sell effaced, what's his face
You erased yourself
So shut up, you don't let up

You have a growth that must be treated
Like a sudden severe pain in the neck
You can smell it but you can't see it
No explanation identified
'Cause you don't know, you don't say

Hey you, where did you come from?
Got a head full of lead

The Blessing,"Oh, angel baby
I tell you what is on your mind
A dealer running down the coast
Now it’s coming on to leaving time

Unload in Alabama
And we’re sailing on to St. Giles
I’m hitching on a wave
On the weather on a seabird’s smile

Bad August on the moon
Kicking up the wind and rain
The swells hit thirty feet
Steal the balance from my brain

The captain and his crew
Are cut-throats down in the Port of Spain
White-knuckled at the rains
His timbers wail in shame

See me wistful in some harbor bar
I tend the warm glass and the duelling scar
I sing my misappropriation song
For lovers land-locked far too long

Oh, angel baby
I lapping on a blue romance
For cargo and by compass
With a serpent’s tail in chance

Through the forties and the trades
And a cutlass raised in rage
Just for cotton and tobacco
For whiskey and for gage

Take the whip to drive the sugar train
A scent plantation and banana rain
I sing my misappropriation song
For lovers land-locked far too long

Oh, come inside the hurricane room
Oh, come inside the hurricane room
Oh, come inside the hurricane room
Angel baby, you’re my hurricane room

Oh, come inside the hurricane room
Oh, come inside the hurricane room
Oh, come inside the hurricane room

Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Neon black cocks rot into poison wine.
Neon black flowers on the mass grave.
Neon black corpses, stacked, eclipse the horizon.
Neon black whip, war gang hiss;
While Devastator sips from the crystal chalice.
Neon black lemonade drip drips from his grin crammed with cool charm,
Culture and opulence.

The bayonets clamor on all night, hemming scars into the hillside.
Devastator sleeps under satin sheets.
""Death campaigns are a fucking gold mine.""
And all the swine at the cabaret lick their lips as they clap along.
Devastator, in a negligee, does a strip tease while he sings this song:
""Everybody needs a little Devastation!""

Neon black dirt in the garden.
All the roses blossom into skulls this season.
Neon black branches hanging from the trees.
Every limb is empty, robbed of pleasant memories.

The fields are throbbing fresh cut bruises.
Devastator violates with dirty fingers.
Neon black flames cook the calm air.
The party's over, what was your favorite gift?
Neon black future charging like a bull with a funeral bouqet ready to explode.

I'm drinking cement like it's going out of style, style, style
Those cold hooks, cemetery claws
Raking out the infants' jaws
Set fire to the horse on fire!
Set fire to the dress on fire!
Set fire to the stage on fire!
Set fire to the stars on fire!

now I'm tied to a seagull's back-yeah, fire, fire, fire
And all those black-haired bandits try to lure me down with their songs and choir, choir, choir
I'd rather shoot up a syringe filled with fire, fire, fire
Than go to bed with sounds so vacant and tired tired tired

what's the sound of a cashing check?
What's the sound of a gag reflex?
Like speakers crushed beneath an empty tank
Blowing the ugly off an airbrushed face

set fire to the drums on fire!
Set fire to the lions on fire!
Set fire to the house on fire!
Set fire to the face on fire!

The Blood Brothers,"


You're walking through the forests where they feed the trees broken glass.
John lennon and the rolling stones crooning in plastic bags.
Spit shine your black luck now, baby.
You turn on the radio, the speakers spit tangled talk.
Everything is war and who's fucked their way to the top.
But they'll eat black clouds we all eat black clouds.
You're working on a cruise serving caviar to the cruel.
They repossessed your heart; you're making payments on your face, too.
Spit shine your black clouds now, baby.
And what if your religion turns out to be a cruel joke, and you're fucked beyond all hope?
Gonna spit shine your black clouds now, baby.
First you stayed in bed all day and walked around all night.
Then you threw your phone away and slept beneath the freeway underpass.
Your mother slit her throat after your father's heart attack.
And you've got two little sisters still in school.
What'cha gonna do? what'cha gonna do?
Just sit and watch the ships loading their freight
And pale pelicans feeding their young and grasp at the barbarically charming sun.
Out on the weekend talked your way out of a first date.
Said your uncle was famous, by then it was too late.
Spit shine your black luck now, baby.
Fall asleep to the tv-the cops are talking tough
To the cameras in the backseat, to the audience at home.
But they'll eat black clouds we all eat black clouds.
Once you knew a girl with skin like a sapphire sun.
Took you back to her apartment, told you everything you did wrong.
Spit shine your black luck.
Spit shine your black luck.
The sky's so desolate like flesh on a skull-shaped balloon.
You sit in bed writing love letters to yourself.
No black ink on the black paper, bay.
Stare at the ceiling, fall into dreamless sleep.
Day climbs your chimney, taps you on the shoulder blade,
""spit shine your black clouds now, baby.""
All your best friends grow up to be successful actresses.
All your bitter enemies died of liver failure in kent, washington trailers.
All your brothers made babies until their brains turned brown.
The world's lounging longways on an unbridled black cloud.

Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

The Blood Brothers,"We're the boys jailed in a horse's skull.
We nailed our ears to a feral glittery drone.
The only thing that makes our blood feel like blood
Is stealing cars and watching lightning bolts fuck.
So don't look away, every day's the same,
Every song's the same in this sanitized exploding airplane.
Well I got shot in the face, it's all on videotape
So come on, watch the blood, it's pouring commercial-free
Well I got shot in the face, it's all on videotape
So come on, watch the blood, it's pouring commercial-free
We're the girls chewing styrofoam
Pulling our wigs under a monochrome glow.
The only line that's talking us into bed
Is the freeway's static hiss drilling holes in our heads, so
So don't look away from the clouds leaking rust
The kingdom of heaven reeks of burning witches and dust.
Well I got shot in the face, it's all on videotape
So come on, watch the blood, it's pouring commercial-free
Well I got shot in the face, it's all on videotape
So come on, watch the blood, it's pouring commercial-free
Seven items dripped out the back of my head:
One big war and one color red;
One vulgar leg and one designer tree;
Two stallions and a pound of confetti.
Oh, salvation!
Hollow lightning, so skeletal...
Shipwrecked freeways!
Concrete ribcage, so boring...
Oh, salvation!
Hollow lightning, so skeletal

Let's sling our rain slicks over February's fantastic antlers
Sprouting from the foreheads of world famous romancers.
The winter's looming like a bloodthirsty bird of prey.
And I guarantee by spring we'll either be world famous or goddamned dead.
Guitar one fastens languid years to busty bones like dust and skin on a dull antique moon.
Guitar two's touch keeps ruining lovers for other lovers
Like jokers concealed in trick decks in our laps.
There's a train tumbling down torn paper tracks while weeds blossom from heartbeats that lack.
Guitar three's dancing even though her song stopped playing ages and ages ago.
She's at an empty dance club suspended in the middle of a rambling sentence.
Guitar four says, ""if you still believe in the grace of man,
Let me introduce you to greedy greedy hands.""
Let's sling our rain slicks over every single second
To the rapture dripping from clocks ticking all our misadventures.
The winter left town with some seventeen-year-old waitress.
And spring's laying in a pile of all the moments of our misadventures.

But in the cold light of day, it's a grim reality
You talk about freedom but I just don't understand
The castle that you've built is made out of sand

And the goods you sell are the ones we already own
And the lies you tell to build, you sacred home

Too easy to divide the us from them

The Blue Aeroplanes,"On a railway train to anywhere,
Something happened finally.
The driver said he saw no station
And we were riding aimlessly.

The train was filled with sleeping passengers,
Going nowhere for the ride;
Spoken whispers filled the carriages
No one cared to look outside.

Conversation aimed at anyone
Bouncing questions off the wall;
Except for two excited children.
Burning caterpillars in the hall.

All at once, I got quite frightened..
Standing up, I gave a shout!
""I see a station just in front of me ,
Stop this train and let me out!""

The driver smiled and shook his head for me,
""this train don't stop for anyone.
And, if you want to leave this railway line,
You'll have to jump off on your own.

Someone came and gave me sandwiches,
Saying that I looked unwell.
He took my pulse and he gave it back to me,
And then he hit me with his bell.

He made a speech to all the passengers,
He said ""I've been a place today;
And anyone who'd care to come with me..
Step outside and walk this way.""

Inside the seats were warm and comfortable,
Outside the train was wild and strange.
I said, ""yes, sir, I'd like to come with you,
It's really time I made a change.""

I left my seat and walked up front with him,
And he began to push the door.
I looked outside, but it nearly blinded me..
I'd never seen such light before.

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura

He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought
He got nothin to eat, no shoes on his feet
She even left his clothes, out in the street

He always hears voices when he's all alone

I seen him eatin dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat
I barely can stand, on my own two feet""

For one comand I stand and wait now

Caught it again today
One of the last things
I ever heard
I wish I'd never heard her say
Some of the worst things we ever do
Gonna come around again
So I keep on trying to change my ways
As I head up around the bend

If I could rearrange my life right now
I'd point and click and drag
And I would make a change cut off that screen
And drop my Windows in that paper bag
Can't let that machine fill up my mind
Gonna work it all out upstairs
I'll write down this information
Create a new fire
And make like I ain't got no cares
It's a circle of seasons
Spinning around and round
Coming home to another day
I've got plenty of reasons that the deal goes down
Just turn around renew myself
Gonna try a little harder every day
Gonna play a little longer just as long as I can
Get it right somehow working every day

She stares you into focus
While pretending not to care
She's wondering if you really notice
That she can drive you insane
And she stop a train in those jeans
There's no other way to tell you
She knows what love really means

Maria, she's one in a million to me
Maria, she is the only one for me

And little does she know
She's the reason for every single dream
And little does she know
I'm comin apart at the seams
With one touch of her hand
She reminds me why I came to be
And I think it's time she knows
She's the only one for me

He's on the road again, sure as you're born

Went to my house, the front door was locked
Went 'round to my window
But my window was locked
Jumped right back, shook my head
Big old rounder in my folding bed

Jumped into the window, broke the glass
Never seen that little rounder run so fast

She's on the road again, sure as you're born
Natural born, he's been on the road again
He's on the road again, sure as you're born

The Blue Dogs,"A young man from a small town
With a very large imagination
Lay alone is his room with his radio on
Looking for another station
When the static from the Mouthpiece
Gave way to the sound below
James Dean went out to Hollywood
And put his picture is a picture show 

And it's Oh Daddy get off of your knees
Mama why'd you have to go
Your Darlin' Jim is out on a limb
I put my picture in a picture show
Put my picture in a picture show

John Garfield is the afternoon
Montgomery Clift at night
When the static from the mouthpiece
Gave way to the sound below
James Dean went out to Hollywood
And put his picture in a picture show 

A Mocca Man in a wigwam
Sitting on a reservation
With a big black hole
In the belly of his soul
Waiting on an explanation
While the white man
Sits on his fat can
And takes pictures of the Navajo
Every time he clicks
His Kodak pics
He steals a little bit of soul

The Blue Dogs,"Half of my mistakes I made stone cold sober
Half of my mistakes I made at closing time
Half the time I never saw it coming till it was over
Half of my mistakes I made with love on the line
Half of my mistakes I swear I should've known better
Half of my mistakes were made just among friends
You get a little distance on it, truth gets clearer
Half of my mistakes, hell i'd probably make 'em again

[CHORUS]
If I had it all to do over, I'm sure i'd win and lose just as much
But I'd spend a lot less time on right and wrong
And a lot more time on love
Half of my mistakes I made cause I was moving too quickly
Half of them were made cause my heart moved too slow
Nobody can tell you a damn thing if you ain't listening
Half of my mistakes I made because I couldn't let go

[CHORUS TWICE]
Half of my mistakes I'd give anything to change how it ended
Half of my mistakes, God I wouldn't change a single thing
You can lean to hard on regret, but I don't recommend it

The Blue Dogs,"[Chorus]
It's the greatest feeling in the whole wide world
Just ask Smokey, Shakespeare, or Merle
When boy meets girl is what they've been talking about for so long
So what's wrong with love songs anyhow?

I've got cheatin' songs and drinkin' songs about bars down in Dallas
Politics, limericks, and Irish murder ballads
But too much of that bitterness makes a man's heart calloused
I ain't afraid to admit it
Life's so much better when love's right there in it

[Chorus]

I've got sing-a-longs and gospel songs and ones about Elvis
Hey rock and roll ain't nothin but a story that's worth telling
But love is so much bigger that the current thing that's selling
I don't mean to preach and shout it
But I'm sure going to stand up and sing about it

[Chorus]

I've been spending all my time trying to find the perfect song
Something that moves you just right and makes your want to sing along
But I'm stuck on finding a subject that this song is worthy of
And when I put my mind to it all I can think about is love

The Blue Dogs,"Sometimes when the night builds walls around me
I find myself thinking about the time you found me
I was lost until you came around
With your sweet love

In my dreams
Sometimes I think I feel you right behind me
And it seems it's just the little things that remind me

Just a fool
With wandering eyes
But I was blind
Until I realized
Your sweet love

Oh by and by
As my eye
Caught you walking by
Much to my surprise
Me with my disguise
You saw through it all
I never knew that something was wrong
Until your light came along

Sometime though the night builds walls around me
I try reaching out from a window inside me

Reach for you
Arms open wide
Promise me
Forever and besides
All I need
When I lay down at night
All I need
Is your sweet love
Your Sweet Love

And every night, I hope that I won't dream of you

And your pretty face that I will never again see, I see, I see

May not come tomorrow but will surely come again
And the words I'm sorry often come too late
For a fare I left you with nothing left to say
At trouble bay, trouble bay, here I'll stay, trouble bay

Like a wave coming after me
In the water cold
Dark and deep
I'll face these days on my own

When the sun goes down the shadows disappear
And the words I love you are all that I hear
I call your name in the darkest hour
Whisper your name, whisper in vain

So every night, I wait to pay the devil's due

The Blue Sky Boys,"Green grow the lilacs, all sparkling with dew
I'm lonely, my darling, since parting with you;
But by our next meeting I'll hope to prove true
And change the green lilacs to the Red, White and Blue.
I once had a sweetheart, but now I have none

She's gone and she's left me, I care not for one
Since she's gone and left me, contented I'll be,
For she loves another one better than me.

I passed my love's window, both early and late
The look that she gave me, it makes my heart ache;
Oh, the look that she gave me was painful to see,
For she loves another one better than me.

I wrote my love letters in rosy red lines,
She sent me an answer all twisted and twined;
Saying,""Keep your love letters and I will keep mine
Just you write to your love and I'll write to mine.""

The Blue Sky Boys,"There are those who are taking vacations to the mountains the lakes and the sea 
Where they rest from their cares and their troubles 
What a wonderful time that must be 
But it seems not my lot to be like them I must toil through the heat and the cold 
Seekin' out the lost sheep on the mountains bringing wanderers back to the fold 
But when I take my vacation in heaven what a wonderful time that will be 
Hearing concerts by the heavenly chorus and the face of my Saviour I'll see 
Sitting down on the banks of the river neath the shade of the evergreen tree 
There I'll rest from my burdens forever won't you take your vacation with me

That he wouldn't follow the footsteps of his dad
And I've searched both far and wide and I'd feared that he had died
But at fast I found my baby here in jail

(Yes warden) you know I want my baby out of jail
I will pawn you my watch and I'll pawn you my chain
I will pawn you my golden wedding band
I will wash all your clothes and I'll scrub all your floors
If that will get my baby out of jail

That's how I'd cry on my pillow, if you should tell me farewell and goodbye

    That's why I'm blue love, so blue



She's gone so far away thats why I'm griving
She's left me here alone among the trees
And all that I have left is just a memory
And it always haunts me with a breeze



  * Refrain



I'll leave the day they try to find my darling
I don't know where on earth she can be
I know that I can't ever live without her
For each night in dreams her face I see

Now my mind don't work and my whole body aches

What I'm gonna, gonna ask you now
you better think about it twice.

and that is:

Who's making love to your old lady
while you were out making love?

oh oh, you you.

Reason why I ask this question,
I used to be the same old way.
When I decided to straighten up
I found it was a bit too late.
Oh yeah, that's when it all happened,
something I never ever dreamed of.

tune you're hearing. this is ofcourse the green onions tune. it was a very big hit in the early sixties in this country. and ofcourse it was composed and recorded in memphis, tennessee, right here
in the united states of america. you know, people, I believe that this tune can be equated with the great classical music around the world.

Now you go to germany, you've got your bach, your beethoven, your brahms... here in america you've got your fred mcdowell, your irving berlin, your glenn miller, and your booker t & the mg's
.Another example of the great contributions in music and culture that this country has made around the world. and as you look around the world today, you see this country spurned.

You see backs turned on this country. well people, I'm gonna tell you something, this continent, north america, is the stronghold! this is where we're gonna make our stand in this decade! yeah,
people I've got something to say to the state department. I say take that archaic monroe doctrine, and that marshall plan that says we're supposed to police force the world, and throw 'em out! let's stay
Home for the next ten years people! stay right here in north america and enjoy the music and culture that is ours. yeah, I got one more thing to say.

I'm just talking about the music, people, and what it does to me. and that is, as you look around the world, you go to the soviet union or great britain or france, you name it, any country... everybody is doing flips and twists just to get into a genuine pair of american blue jeans! and to hear this music and we got it all here in america, the land of the chrysler 440 cubic inch engine!

Just saddle and steer

It seems a lifetime away
When we first met in town and spent a night
We drank and we talked until the music was stopped

And the barman came and turned back on the light
We arranged again to meet
And as I walked off down the street
I swear that I felt ten feet tall

Was I dizzy from the wine?
Or maybe I just missed the signs
â??Cause now you won't return my calls
I hope that one day when you're ancient

You close your eyes for one last time
And you see me in my prime

To sacrifice the jukebox.

On the quiz machine

Cause you're partaking in something forbidden
And time after time you'll wake up
Face down in the latrine.

And dim down the lights

On a road to the stars, in a Vostok of love.

With just an elegant flick of her wrist,
I was made to realise that I could never exist,
She brushed me aside and tapped off her ash,
And my life went up like the head of a match.

Imagine the treasure she keeps,
What I wouldnÃ¢??t give to simply sit and watch her sleep.

The Bluetones,"It was in those wonder-lust years, after I'd just left school,
That I first started to notice the change in everything.
I realised that the people I'd known all my life, (Take a long hard look,)
My family and friends were all just like strange little islands. (around the world you've helped to build.)
I didn't know who they were any more than I knew myself. (A Techni-colour wide-screen hell,)
It was at this point that I just started to drift. (beyond your window sill.)
A small balloon escaping from a child's hand. (Get over it, I'm only just getting my stride.)

Dig a hole for a broken man,
A man who could not cry,
Always a slave in a vacuous age,
Much passed him by.

I withdrew from all social activity quite dramatically,
Never seeing anybody unless I absolutely had to.
For the first 8 and a half months, (God-forsaken,)
I saw no-one except the guy who worked in the all-night petrol station. (belly-aching,)
And that suited me just fine. (low-life parasite.)
I dreamt of never having to go outside for any reason again, ever. (So much angry cynicism,)
Of being buried in my house with all my stuff, (so much angst and spite.)
Like a huge asbestos sarcophagus. (Get over it, I'm only just getting my stride.)

Dig a hole for a broken man,
A man who could not cry,
Always a slave in a vacuous age,
Much passed him by.

And I know what you're thinking,
'This guy needs to get out a bit more. Make contact.'
But that's not it. You see,
Since I've been away from other people,
Lots of things have improved in my life.
I'm a much better individual, thank you.
And now I've almost forgotten all the little things that used to bug me.
My appetites are healthy, and my mood is calm and even.

I can remember how it started
I'd follow the firemen
I'd dreamed of the astronauts
They looked so happy in their shiny metal headgear
I knew that inside they were smiling
Ba da da da da da
Ba da da da da da
Ba da da da da da
Ya dop ba dop ba dop ba dop bop
My mother feared I was abnormal
I'd take out the colandar
And put it on my head
People are happy when they know that they're protected
Just let me tell you why I'm smiling
I've got my helmet on
Nothing can do me wrong
I've got my helmet on
Ya dop ba dop ba dop ba dop bop

Down in the coal mines lighting the way
From distant battlefields to the tiniest motor scooter

Chicken fajitas with nachos and peppers
A bite stuck in my windpipe, it gave me a fright
I choked and I gagged, and I saw this sight
In coordinated outfits
Promenading 'cross the dance floor
Rehearsing their moves while they waited for the salad
Her cowboy boots were red with black trim
And he was so handsome, so tall and so slim
Were they angels of mercy or dance instructors?
I was so lucky, it was one chance in a million
That they were there in Arizona to go dancing.
They two-stepped to my table
And hugged their arms around me
Pulled me to my feet and we whirled across the floor
The squeezed me so tightly my peppers popped free
I thought it was Heimlich
But it might have been Arthur Murray
Were they angels of mercy or dance instructors?

The Bobs,"I am a lonesome hombre
I spend my time driving my truck around town on Saturdays
I moved here from the city
I thought that maybe
All of my luck would change here in Boomtown
But it seems my face is wrong
I don't fit in
'Cause I don't have
Cowboy, cowboy, cowboy lips, 
Cowboy, cowboy, cowboy lips ...

Cowboy lips are all right, all right by me
Strap me on a pair of lips and I'll leave you be
High in the saddle, my Chapstick in hand
Through snow and wind and rain and sleet and sand,
Cowboy Land...

When I'm with all my buddies
My snakeskin boots and my belt buckles shine
But they won't talk to me
Even when I know their song I'm in the wrong key
'Cause I don't have
Cowboy, cowboy, cowboy lips, 
Cowboy, cowboy, cowboy lips ...

Cowboy lips are all right, all right by me
Jack Palance has got a sneer that's collagen-free
If I had his mustache I'd wax up the tips
To keep it off my cowboy lips, cowboy lips

When I'm out honky-tonkin'
I smoke my Marlboros with the filters off
It makes me cough
I can stomach Lone Star Beer
But not shots of rye
Rye can only get by
Cowboy, cowboy, cowboy lips, 
Cowboy, cowboy, cowboy lips ...

Cowboy lips are all right, all right by me
Painted, pierced and puckered are for sissies, you see (I likes 'em)
Weathered and blistered and kissed by her brand
The kind of lips they wear in Cowboy--

Lots of facial hair in Cowboy Lannnnnnnd ...

Soon it will be fifty and I won't be worrying about ulcers

Soon I'll be nocturnal and knocking over your garbage

And I'll walk and I'll find solace
And the sun will shine upon me like a mother keep me warm - my pulse
   goes...

I see hallucinations of figures like yourself
I feel like I'm on acid and you're alive and well
Hope you get well soon - wait 'til you see your new grandson

We'll walk and we'll part in a nice way
Because  I don't think I was ready when you left so suddenly
And if I could just set this date up
It would out my mind at ease to say the things I had failed to say
and my pulse would slow hut hut hut hut hut hut...

I'll have another before I go into the party

The Bogmen,"Suddenly a woman leaves me - I've got no job - a machine relieved me
Suddenly I've lost my piece of pie
I'm now in mourning and I wear all blue
That's the color you wear when the dead one's you

Suddenly I am living in a lie
My woman's off with some other guy
I can remember the first time I saw her. 
She was hanging out in one of those singles bars. 
Wearing a really fancy dress 

Drinking a really expensive mixed drink smoking one of those 
Marlboro 100's with the big fancy plastic filters on the end 
Made her look like she had class, least I thought so. 
But then suddenly the bitch left me 

All of a sudden like something suddenly
Suddenly I'm on my own
I don't hear no rings on the telephone
And all the rings I've given her have been returned
I cling to clothes she used to wear

Then I try them on and style my hair
Suddenly I could never be as fine as she
I've got her eyes 
But I sure don't have her teeth

I can remember when we would take walks around the public pool  
and the way she would look at me - and the way she would do this 
whistle and how I would feel - I'm gonna try and show you what it was 
like 

Suddenly I found myself drinking from the lowest shelf
And all of a sudden I just could not believe my eyes
There goes some guy walking down the street wearing my tie
Suddenly I'm not gonna let another man take my woman. 

Not even death can do us part. Because when I'm an angel 
I'm gonna come down from heaven and I'm gonna buy her a brand new Cadillac 
I'm gonna buy her a brand new Cadillac

Let me tell you why, let me tell everybody why
Because in the 50's it was pompadours 
And in the 60's it was peace
In the 70's bellbottoms, I don't know why 
In the 80's Ronald Reagan, BMW's

Let him think he's the ringleader
Then in mid-circus pull the rug out from under him

My fear is that he's nearing the third rail
He's kneeling to another angry idol
And I can see it as his face is getting pale
That he's on his way out of this world

This sudden spat of insanity - needs a good fat dose of humility
Otherwise a dictator will arise in class and rule by fear
So before he gets too old to know what we're doing right now
Before he gets too old to turn a deaf ear - turn it back my way

-Layzie Bone-
If it wasn't for my music, tell me where would I be? (Where would I be?)/ Prolly standin on the hot block, sellin crack rock, runnin them streets, runnin them streets/ I say ""My music is my best friend, my confidant""/ I love the way we live us one together we the perfect bond/ Me and my radio, doin 90 on the freeway, knowin the way to go/ And I like to feel the rhythm, the beat be bumpin, don't it? And I love to give it to y'all, because I know you want it/ And if you feel like I feel, you love the Rhythm and Blues, Reggae and Jazz the Rock n Roll could be cool/ But, I'ma Hip-Hop baby, this from the heart, I never flip-flop baby/ Give me a drank and a song and I be stress free kickin it, all night long

-Krayzie Bone-
It ain't nothin like Hip-Hop music/ Careful how you use it and please don't abuse it, when you do it/ Music can keep you party people dancin and put your mind in a trancin, keep ya happy, give it a chance come on/ Just flow with the music, get blowed off the music/ When I was 13, like Dr. King ya had dream' to be one of the greatest musicians alive/ To be remembered, when I die/ I love, I love, music...it's got me stayin alive/ And if you took my mic right now, one thing you'll never do is take my love away/ Cause I'm a Hip-Hop baby, from the heart I never flip-flop baby

Tossin and turnin, I'm burnin with different melodies, words my niggas tellin me sellin it to the world/ Been rappin, since the day I heard Rakim, and Dana Dane, Doug E Fresh, Slick Rick, always been a singer mayne/ Late night foster home, workin on perfection my selection of the songs that I heard was my direction/ It's when Tommie was my girlfriend, rolled or go back/ Said ""I'm the baddest mama jamma"", half white and black/ Have my babies: D'Jodecy, sick with Serena, little breed born Bryon, Miss Moe, and Shanika/ Little Trey-Trey, Destiny, and plus Aaliyah, and the newest one is Shelby/ I can't wait till I see em (Dada), they are the music in my physical form since they was born, I've been singin wit tears in my eyes as I perform, for the whole world/ Until I die like Confuscious, tell the world my name is Bryan, I'm in love with my music/ (Yea, uh) Cause I'm a Hip-Hop baby, cause I'ma Hip-Hop baby, cause I'ma Hip-Hop baby, cause I'ma Hip-Hop

And three dollar bills
Forgot the joker in the cash crusade

Out for what we all want, lots of L.S.D.
He also had a camel, stole it from a zoo
How he loved the camel, and the camel loved him too
(Oh, how the how the camel loved Ali Bar Bar!)

Ali Baba's camel loved Ali Baba so

Some say that he's in Heaven, but this I know is true

He was so very thirsty, and everybody knows
It's horrible to walk for miles with sand between your toes

Ali Baba's camel turned round and licked his hand
He said, ""Oh, Ali Baba, I surely understand
We must find an oasis and get a drink somehow
But, hark! I hear the temple bells, they'll all be open now""
(Bleah bleah. Glorious beer, fills you right up with it... aaahh)

They entered for the races at the desert sports
There goes Ali's camel in his filthy cotton shorts
The starter cracked his pistol, off the camel's hared
Ali Baba's camel wins by half a camel's hair
(Hey Ali Baba! Hey Ali Baba!)
(Your camel loves you! Your camel loves you!)

Ali Baba's camel had run for miles and miles
His tail was pointing backwards, that's how a camel smiles
But Ali and his camel, they both were out of breath
They'd run so far, they laughed so much
They laughed themselves to death

Oh! Gather round the campfire! Sing a roundelay!

Everything'll be fi- HINE!! 

C'mon George, snap out of it 

Yes, if you'll just give me a minute of your time, 
I will explain! 

Truth is just a word and words are just 
Words are words but truth is what we trust 
How can we know if words fill our brains? 
How can we show if blood fills our veins? 
Truth in words is like our blood congealed 
Words like turds escape but truth is sealed

High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars 
climb halfway to the stars!

My love waits there in San Francisco,
above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,
your golden sun will shine for me!

Drinking bear sits in Silver's Arcade 
Sips imaginary lemonade

Writing letters home 
What a lovely view-EE-ooo (blah blah blab blab) (Dear Mom) 
""What the Butler Saw"" was a bit of a drag 
The captain says he's going to heave, too 

Bored with Bingo, we went for a swim 
Fat sea cows with gorgonzola skin 
Semi-nude! 

After lunch, we grabbed our trunks 
And we all got cramp! 
Trousers rolled, the sea is cold 
But it's good for chillblains 

On the prom, white plimsolls and blue shorts

The Bonzo Dog Band,"I appreciate the simple things
Cause I'm awfully fond of getting
Love in an actual setting.
This is what I call the simple things:
Just a winding stream where I can drift and dream.
And now I'm waiting for you.

By a waterfall I'm calling you.
We can share it all beneath a ceiling of blue.
We'll spend a heavenly day
Here where the whispering waters play.
There's a whipper will that's calling you.
By a waterfall, he's dreaming too.
There's a magic melody
Mother nature sings to me
Beside a waterfall with you.

The Bonzo Dog Band,"After his second wife passed away, 
Percy Rawlinson seemed to spend more and more time with his alsatian owl.
His friends told him 
""You should get out more, Percy, or you'll wind up looking like a dog, ha ha.""
He was later arrested near a lampost.
At his trial some months later he surprised everyone by mistaking a policeman for a postman and tearing his trousers off with his bare teeth. 
In his defence he told the court ""It's hard to tell the difference when they take their hats off.""

Mrs Betty Pench was playing the trombone when she heard a knock on the door.
""I wonder who that is at eleven o'clock in the morning"" she thought, but cautiously opened the door and instead of the turbaned ruffian she had expected, she found a very nice young man. 
""Mrs. Pench, you've won the car contest, would you like a triumph spitfire or 3000 in cash?"" He smiled.
Mrs. Pench took the money. ""What will you do with it all? Not that it's any of my business,"" he giggled.
""I think I'll become an alcoholic,"" said Betty.

With a geranium behind each ear and his face painted with gay cavalistic symbols, six foot eight seventeen stone police sergeant Geoff Bull looked jolly convincing as he sweated and grunted through a vigorous triscutine at the Fraga Gogo Viachella.
His hot surge trousers flapped wildly over his enormous plastic sandals as he jumped and jumped and gyrated towards a long-haired man. 
""Uh, excuse me, ma'am, I have reason to believe you can turn me on.""
He leered suggestively.
As if by magic dozens of truncheons appeared and they mercilessly thrashed him.
Poor Geoff, what a turnout for the books.

Much as he hated arguments or any kind of unpleasantness, Ron Shir thought things had gone too far when, returning from a weekend in Clapton, he found that his neighbour had trimmed the enormous hedge dividing their gardens into the shape of a human leg.
Enraged and envious beyond belief, Ron seized his garden shears and clipped his white poodle Leo into a coffee table.
""That'll fix it,"" thought Ron, but he was wrong. 
The following Wednesday his neighbour had his bushy waist-length hair cut and permed into a model of the Queen Elizabeth and went sailing. 
Everywhere he went, people said ""Hooray!""

And the music calls
But you're trapped inside
Those four walls
It's not your fault that
She has changed
It's not her fault

And you feel the pace
But you're the one who
Knows it's not a race
To be won

And I know you'd like to disappear
You'd like to lose the fear
You dream the love you had
Is near

Haven't been out
Your ears are still sore
From the latest bout 
Something's gonna have to change

Feeling shame you raised your smile",Leaves and Sand
