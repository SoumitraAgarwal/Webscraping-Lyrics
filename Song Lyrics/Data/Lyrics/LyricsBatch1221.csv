The Four Lads,"Our love affair is a wondrous thing
That we'll rejoice in remembering
Our love was born with our first embrace
And a page was torn out of time and space
Our love affair, may it always be
A flame to burn through eternity
So, take my hand with a fervent prayer
That we may live and we may share
A love affair to remember
 
Our love affair is a wondrous thing
That we'll rejoice in remembering
Our love was born with our first embrace
And a page was torn out of time and space
Our love affair, may it always be
A flame to burn through eternity
So, take my hand with a fervent prayer
That we may live and we may share",An Affair to Remember
The Four Lads,"I'll never stop loving you
Whatever else I may do
My love for you will live 'til time itself is through
I'll never stop wanting you
And when forever is through
My heart will beat the way it does each time we meet
The night doesn't question the stars that appear in the skies
So why should I question the stars that appear in my eyes
Of this I'm more than just sure
My love will last and endure
I'll never, no, I'll never stop loving you

I'll never stop loving you
Whatever else I may do
My love for you will live 'til time itself is through

The night doesn't question the stars that appear in the skies
So why should I question the stars that appear in my eyes
Of this I'm more than just sure
My love will last and endure
I'll never, no, I'll never stop loving you

The Four Lads,"Istanbul was Constantinople
Now it's Istanbul not Constantinople
Been a long time gone
Old Constantinople's still has Turkish delight
On a moonlight night

Every gal in Constantinople
Is a Miss-stanbul, not Constantinople
So if you've date in Constantinople
She'll be waiting in Istanbul

Even old New York was once New Amsterdam
Why they changed it, I can't say
(People just liked it better that way)

[Chorus]
Take me back to Constantinople
No, you can't go back to Constantinople
Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople
Why did Constantinople get the works?
That's nobody's business but the Turks'

Istanbul!!
Istanbul!!

Even old New York was once New Amsterdam
Why they changed it, I can't say
(People just liked it better that way)

[Chorus]

Istanbul!!",Istanbul
The Four Lovers,"Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Please don't leave me, baby, please don't go
Please don't leave me baby, please don't go 
Well, if you go 'way and leave me, dear you're gonna hurt me so
Yes I love you baby, gonna tell all the world I do 
Yes I love you baby, gonna tell all the world I do 
Well, if you go 'way and leave me, don't know what I'm gonna do
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

The Gaslight Anthem,"We were the magnificent dreamers
In secret lamplight hideouts
We swore the world couldn't break us
Even when the world took us down

So here I am strugglin' out in the mighty jungle
Movin' eighteen miles a minute but not slowing down for nothin'
I look to my left and I look to my right
And I'm callin' out for my brothers but it's so dark in this night
Am I alone?

Did they fall down by the wayside?
Was I movin' too blind to see them?
Were they callin' out to me?
Or did despair set in?

Were the things that we wanted when we were still 16
Only passing and fleeting or just too far out of reach?
Were you hard up or broken man, I woulda helped you out
Were you numb and distracted when I was calling out?
I was calling out

On a Sunday morning the whole crowd assembled
I've done some things that I'm not too proud of
I've never left you, a deaf ear for longing
Some hearts are gallows, I'm not here for hangin' around

It's all right, man
I'm only bleeding, man
Stay hungry, stay free
And do the best you can

It's all right, man
I'm only bleeding, man
Stay hungry, stay free
And do the best you can",We're Getting a Divorce You Keep the Diner
The Gaslight Anthem,"And tonight the coastline is quiet
It's quieter than it's ever been
Honey, this town is a prison
With its four walls closin' in

And they got one pill to make you smaller
They got one pill to make you scream
Darlin' this heart is on fire
And this life is but a dream

All right, all right

You see, this town pulls my heartstrings
I fell in love with the Shrewsbury stars
But there's far too many diamonds
In the backseats of borrowed cars

And I could never stop this burnin'
Honey, I can't tell no lies
I could never stand the weather
Darlin' this heart is on fire

All right, all right

Tonight, tonight, we're gonna ride like silver on the desolation moonlight
Tonight, tonight, we ain't comin' back until the morning light
Tonight, tonight, it's all right, all right
Tonight, tonight

All right, all right

Dance in my moonlight, my old friend the twilight
Dance in my moonlight, my old friend the twilight
Dance in my moonlight, my old friend the twilight
Dance in my moonlight, my old friend",Wooderson
The Gaslight Anthem,"We are the boys from Little Eden
We are the heart of Saturday night
We drink from the fountains off the fireworks
Sweat and bone for a better life

We like our choruses sung together
We like our arms in our brothers' arms
Call every girl we ever met Maria
But I only love Virginia's heart

Still we sing with our heroes, 33 rounds per minute
We're never going home until the sun says we're finished
I'll love you forever if I ever love at all
Wild hearts, blue jeans, & white t-shirts

Some things baby never told you
Some things papa done ain't right
Spent a lifetime just to get over
You always said my mama tried

Still we sing with our heroes, 33 rounds per minute
We're never going home until the sun says we're finished
I'll love you forever if I ever love at all
With wild hearts, blue jeans, & white t-shirts

So tonight I'll call you from a Fourth Street payphone
We'll sleep on the beach if we ain't got a ride
Someday I'll buy you that house on Cookman
We could sleep on the beach all night

Sleep on the beach if we ain't got a ride
Sleep on the beach all night
Sleep on the beach all night
Sleep on the beach if we ain't got a ride",Blue Jeans & White T-Shirts
The Gaslight Anthem,"We're having a party, everybody's swingin'
Tonight won't you come down out of your tower?
Don't make me dance all night alone
Alright!

Call up your girlfriends to come out tonight
I'll call up my best friends to come out tonight
We'll put on our best shirts and finest cologne
And we'll turn the Casanova on

Come on out Maria and lose the tragic
Come on out Maria and I'll show you some magic
Meet on the warm sand and waltz out the twilight
And watch the carnival lights explode

We're having a party, everybody's swingin'
Tonight won't you come down out of your tower?
Don't make me dance all night alone

I've seen you from the window around
I can't get your perfume memory out
So come on before we get much older
And that can happen any one of these nights

Before we turn to ghosts on the mist on the sand
Or fall in line for more conducive plans
I never took a shot to the higher minds
But I can hold the soft waltz down

Meet me tonight
Let's see what can happen

We're having a party, everybody's swingin'
Tonight won't you come down out of your tower?
Don't make me dance all night alone

Cause everybody's shaking like the end of the world
And everybody's waiting on the end of the world
And I ain't got a friend, baby, left in the world
Don't make me dance all night alone

We're having a party, everybody's swingin'
Tonight won't you come down out of your tower?
Don't make me dance all night alone

Cause everybody's shaking like the end of the world
And everybody's waiting on the end of the world
And I ain't got a friend, baby, left in the world
Don't make me dance all night alone",Say I Won't (Recognize)
The Gaslight Anthem,"I wanna know how you dance pretty baby, by the light of the moon
Do you carry your lovers around in a heart like a tomb with a view?
I wanna know how you lose, pretty baby, does it show in your eyes?
Were you born to be a runner, or are you a casual sigh?
Did the boys at school break your precious heart in two?

And in every sad, sad country song
Is there a little bitty piece of 'em still hanging on?
You tell me yours and I'll tell you mine, my dear
And we'll bury these old ghosts here

Where'd you get those eyes?

What do you see with those eyes, pretty darling, in the dead of the night?
Are you saying your prayers or are you glowing like the metal on the edge of the knife?
Baby whose name sounds right on the lips of my queen?
Am I speaking in riddles, or do you feel what I mean?
Are you dying to move, or are you dying to be the one moved?

And would you shake, shake, shake, shake, shake Senora?
If I could make you feel like he used to make you feel
I'll swing you a song and I'll dance you a dance right now

And would you shake, shake, shake, shake, shake Senora?
If I could make you feel like he used to make you feel
I'll swing you a song and I'll dance you a dance right now
And we'll bury these old ghosts down

We'll bury these old ghosts down
Down, down, down
Down, darlin', down
Down, down",SeÂçòor and the Queen
The Gaslight Anthem,"I cut my teeth on the stone of a teenage romance
I was the salt of the earth, I was hard 
The last of the independents

And in the breath from my chest I was blowing kerosene
My lips and fingertips were stone, I wore my heart on my jeans
I sang the blues like the dogs left too long in the street
I still sing the blues with the dogs

And I got half a mind to let it all burn up in this fire
I've had burning through my veins since I first learned to cry
I'd watch this whole night come down and never miss her again
I never felt right and never fit in walkin' in my own skin

Walkin' in my own skin

Now I got scars like the number of stars 
My mind's full of vipers
I got the dust of the desert in my bones 
Comin' through the amplifiers

And in the minor chord fall and the fourth and the fifth
It's a broken Hallelujah and a pain in my fist
I wash my hands like the man with the blood on his teeth
Over and over without relief

And I got nothin' for you darlin' but a story to tell
About the rain on the pavement and the sound as it fell
I'd watch this whole night come down and never miss her again
I never felt right and never fit in

Walkin' in my old man shoes, with my scientist heart
I got a fever and a beaker and a shot in the dark
I need a Cadillac ride, I need a soft summer night
Say a prayer for my soul, Se√±orita

Walkin' in my old man shoes, with my scientist heart
I got a fever and a beaker and a shot in the dark
I need a Cadillac ride, I need a soft summer night
Say a prayer for my soul, Se√±orita

'Cause I've been dying out here in the cold and the snow
Got a picture of you, Mama, to remind me of home
On the hood of a Dodge on a Saturday night
Say a prayer for my soul, Se√±orita","Wherefore Art Thou, Elvis?"
The Gaslight Anthem,"Well, I wonder which song they're gonna play when we go.
I hope it's something quiet and minor and peaceful and slow.
When we float out into the ether, into the Everlasting Arms,
I hope we don't hear Marley's chains we forged in life.

'Cause the chains I been hearing now for most of my life,
The chains I been hearing now for most of my life.

Did you hear the fifty-nine Sound coming through on grandmother's radio?
Did you hear the rattling chains in the hospital walls?
Did you hear the old gospel choir when they came to carry you over?
Did you hear your favorite song one last time?

And I wonder were you scared when the metal hit the glass?
See, I was playing a show down the road
When your spirit left your body.
And they told me on the front lawn.
I'm sorry I couldn't go,
But I still know the song and the words and her name and the reasons.
And I know 'cause we were kids and we used to hang
I know 'cause we were kids and we used to hang

Did you hear the fifty-nine sound coming through on grandmother's radio?
Did you hear the rattling chains in the hospital walls?
Did you hear the old gospel choir when they came to carry you over?
Did you hear your favorite song one last time?

Young boys, young girls, 
Young boys, young girls,
Young boys, young girls,
Young boys, young girls,

Ain't supposed to die on a Saturday night,
Ain't supposed to die on a Saturday night,
Ain't supposed to die on a Saturday night,
Ain't supposed to die on a Saturday night,

Did you hear the rattling chains in the hospital walls?
Did you hear the old gospel choir when they came to carry you over?
Did you hear your favorite song one last time?

The Gaslight Anthem,"In the back seats of burned out cars
In the disenchantment lane
The ideal angels twist and turn
And ask forgiveness for future mistakes

But you and I, we've been through this
Maybe a hundred times before
Always hitchin' rides with strangers
That papa warned us about before

But you know the summer always brought in
That wild and reckless breeze
And in the backseats we just tried to find
Some room for our knees

And in the backseats we just tried to find some room to breathe
And in the backseats we just tried to find some room to breathe

And in the wild desert sun
We drove straight on through the night
We rode the fever out of Austin
Dreamed of California lights

Come July, we'll ride the Ferris wheel
Go 'round and 'round and 'round
And if you never let me go
Well, I will never let you down

And you know the summer always brought in
All those wild and reckless breezes
And in the backseats we just tried to find
Some room for our knees

And in the backseats we just tried to find some room to breathe
And in the backseats we just tried to find some room to breathe

And these cowboys all go crazy in the heat
Chasin' the lights and all the girls along the Santa Ana streets
They're just dyin' to meet
It meant nothin' to me

You know the summer always brought in
That wild and reckless breeze
And in the backseats we just tried to find
Some room for our knees

You know the summer always brought in
That wild and reckless breeze
And in the backseats we just tried to find
Some room for our knees

You know the summer always brought in
That wild and reckless breeze
And in the backseats we just tried to find
Some room for our knees, hey",The Backseat
The Gaslight Anthem,"Do you hear that whistle wail?
I think the end is comin' in
I'm a whole lot worse for wear
But I'm determined to slip this skin

And I know you're dyin' for a good time
I'm dyin' to breathe again
Oh my, my Virginia

We could run all night and dance upon the architecture
Come and take my hand, I'll give the very best I can
But boy, I still want to be your man
I'm still these nervous feet and heart of stone
Forget this dead man's town, I'll take you home

Do you hear me late at night?
Always pickin' at the pieces
Sometimes nothin' comes out right
And nothin' is relievin'

But every soul man's song
Is a night I'd like to spend with you
Just twistin' the night away

But it's past quarter to three
And it's past the midnight hour
Mustang Sally's left the building
And we're so much worse without her

If I could put down this old hammer
I'd take you somewhere new
Oh my, my Virginia

We could run all night and dance upon the architecture
Come and take my hand, I'll give the very best I can
But boy, I still want to be your man
I'm still these nervous feet and heart of stone
Forget this dead man's town, I'll take you home

Oh my, my Virginia

The Gaslight Anthem,"I haven't seen Sandy, Angry Johnny, or Mary
I heard they got married
Mighta had a couple babies
They traded their memories
For fairview and acres
And never play no pinball
Or get up pass the breakers

But not me, pretty baby
I still love Tom Petty songs
And driving old men crazy
And all while Little Eden is waiting
So you sing me a slow song
And I'll drive you crazy
Tonight

Yeah

But all I want is for you to be alright and satisfied
Brothers and sisters know that anytime or late at night,
If you call I will answer, I'm open ears though tired eyes
But the world closed it's arms on us now
Can I get a witness pretty baby?
I still love Tom Petty songs
And driving old men crazy
And all while Little Eden is waiting
So you sing me a slow song
And I'll drive you crazy
Tonight

Alright, alright
Alright, alright
All night, all night!

There's a party tonight, say it's alright
Tell your poppa you'll be home when the good feeling dies

But not me, pretty baby
I still love Tom Petty songs
And driving old men crazy
And all while Little Eden is waiting
So you sing me a slow song darlin'
I'll drive you crazy

Alright, alright
Tonight! Honey!

The Gaslight Anthem,"I'm all washed out by the side of the road
Broken bones Matilda left a note and a rose
Sayin', ""Baby honey child, I've loved you so long
But you deserve much better than me.""

So I'm just burnin' all around all the miles in the road
And I'm never goin' back and I'm never goin' home
I've been gone too long, I've been less right than wrong
I lost so much blood in the fallin' out

And I lit a fire that wouldn't go out
Until it consumed the walls and roof of this house
Until all I remember was burnin' away
And all I remember, you burned it away

See, for ten long years I've been hustlin' around
Tryin' to wash the sins and the sweat from my brow
Just tryin' to find a better life for me and my own
Just some rest for these tired workin' fingers

But nobody never gonna tell you the way
You gotta figure it out boys and suffer the rain
And the fools in the night and the heat of the day
When all you ever really wanted was for someone to understand

And I lit a fire that wouldn't go out
Until it consumed the walls and roof of this house
Until all I remember was burnin' away
And all I remember, you burned it away

Well, don't you take it so hard and baby, don't you cry
You cross your hard heart and you hope to die
Don't you tell me no more lies, you lied all the time
Don't you tell me no more lies, you lied every night

And you're sugar and spice and everything nice
You got Monroe hips, your poisoned lips and knives
And you're sugar and spice and everything nice
You got open wounds in a young boy's pride

And you're sugar and spice and everything nice
You got Monroe hips, your poisoned lips and knives
Sugar and spice, everything nice
Open wounds in a young boy's pride

And I lit a fire that wouldn't go out
Until it consumed the walls and roof of this house
Until all I remember was burnin' away
And all that you left me, you burned it away

Well, don't you take it so hard and baby, don't you cry
You cross your hard heart and you hope to die
Don't you tell me no more lies, you lied all the time
Don't you tell me no more lies, you lied every night

The Gaslight Anthem,"Mary, this station is playing every sad song
I remember like we were alive
I heard it Sunday morn' from inside of these walls
In a prison cell, where we spent those nights

And they burned up the diner where I always used to find her
Licking young boys' blood from her claws
And I learned about the blues from this kitten I knew
Her hair was raven and her heart was like a tomb

My heart's like a wound

And I saw tail lights last night in a dream about my first wife
Everybody leaves and I'd expect as much from you
I saw tail lights last night in a dream about my old life
Everybody leaves, so why, why wouldn't you?

Mary, I worried and stalled every night of my life
Better safe than making the party
And I never had a good time, I sat by my bedside
With papers and poetry about Estella

With great expectations
We had the greatest of expectations

And I saw tail lights last night in a dream about my first wife
Everybody leaves and I'd expect as much from you
I saw tail lights last night in a dream about my old life
Everybody leaves, so why, why wouldn't you?

It's funny how the night moves
Humming a song from 1962

We were always waiting
Always waiting
We were always waiting for something to happen

I saw tail lights last night in a dream about my first wife
Everybody leaves and I'd expect as much from you
I saw tail lights last night in a dream about my old life
Everybody leaves and why, why wouldn't you?",Great Expectations
The Gaslight Anthem,"You can tell Gayle, if she calls,
That I'm famous now for all of these rock and roll songs.
And even if that's a lie, she should've given me a try.
When we were kids on the field of the first day of school.
I would've been her fool.
And I would've sang out your name in those old high school halls.
You tell that to Gayle, if she calls.

And you can tell Jane, if she writes,
That I'm drunk off all these stars and all these crazy Hollywood nights.
And that's a total deceit, but she should've married me.
And tell her I spent every night of my youth on the floor,
Bleeding out from all these wounds.
I would've gotten her a ride out of that town she despised.
You tell that to Janey, if she writes.

But boys will be boys and girls have those eyes
That will cut you to ribbons sometimes.
And all you can do is just wait by the moon
And bleed if it's what she says you oughta do.

You remind Anna, if she asks why,
That a thief stole my heart while she was making up her mind.
I heard she lives in Brooklyn with the cool,
Goes crazy over that New York scene on 7th Avenue.
But I used to wait at the diner, a million nights without her,
Praying she won't cancel again tonight.
And the waiter served my coffee with a consolation sigh.
You remind Anna, if she asks why.
Tell her it's all right.

You know it's hard to tell you this.
Oh it's hard to tell you this.
Here's looking at you, Kid.","Here's Looking at You, Kid"
