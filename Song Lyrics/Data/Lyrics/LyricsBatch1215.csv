There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

Nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

Nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy

All you need is love

That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her to
I love her

She gives my everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I 
Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die

The Coverbeats,"For I have got another girl, another girl
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you
But as from today well I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

For I have got another girl, another girl
She's sweeter that all the girls and I've met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you this time you'd better stop

For I have got another girl 
Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend

I don't want to say that I've been unhappy with you
But as from today, well I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend

The Coverbeats,"How does it feel to be 
One of the beautiful people 
Now that you know who you are 
What do you want to be 
And have you traveled very far 
Far as the eye can see 

How does it feel to be 
One of the beautiful people 
How often have you been there 
Often enough to know 
What did you see when you were there 
Nothing that doesn't show 

Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man, too 
You keep all your money in a big brown bag 
Inside a zoo, what a thing to do 
Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man 
Baby you're a rich man, too 

How does it feel to be

Tuned to a natural E

She's dressed in black

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black
And I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
I think of her

The Coverbeats,"Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France.
The man in the mac said you've got to go back,
You know they didn't even give us a chance.

Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.
Finally made the plane into Paris,
Honeymooning down by the Seine.

Peter Brown called to say,
You can make it OK,
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain.

Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,
Talking in our beds for a week.
The newspapers said, say what're you doing in bed,
I said we're only trying to get us some peace.

Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.
Saving up your money for a rainy day,
Giving all your clothes to charity.

Last night the wife said,
Oh boy, when you're dead you 
Don't take nothing with you but your soul think!
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,
Eating chocolate cake in a bag.

The newspapers said,
She's gone to his head,
They look just like two Gurus in a drag.
Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.

The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me.
Caught the early plane back to London,
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.
The men from the press said we wish you success,
It's good to have the both of you back.

Christ! You know it ain't easy,
You know how hard it can be.
The way things are going,
They're going to crucify me",The Ballad of John and Yoko
The Coverbeats,"For the benefit of Mr. Kite 
There will be a show tonight on trampoline 
The Hendersons will all be there 
Late of Pablo Fanques Fair-what a scene 
Over men and horses hoops and garters 
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire! 
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world! 

The celebrated Mr. K. 
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishops Gate 
The Hendersons will dance and sing 
As Mr. Kite fly's through the ring don't be late 
Messrs. K and H. assure the public 
Their production will be second to none 
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz! 

The band begins at ten to six 
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound 
And Mr. H. will demonstrate 
Ten summer sets he'll undertake on solid ground 
Having been some days in preparation 
A splendid time is guaranteed for all 
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill",Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite

The Coverbeats,"I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Go, go get away from it all

Not even time to find a friend

Through tears I see a blurry red-stained hue
And who knows someday soon no one can ever tell
The scarlet sky might once again be blue.

And caringly I wish the world to stay
Any price I'll pay; I'm waiting patiently
I sense that love will someday have its way

So I'll stay ...
Sitting round the wishing well and I wish you well
Will tomorrow be a yesterday?
Maybe if we all sat around a wishing well
The world wouldn't have to go away

But I won't forget the mercy and i won't forget the walk.

If like a paper back novel my life could be read.
With every turn of the pages, I would be losing again.
You see the curse I was living under, brought nothing but defeat.
Like a desperate, dying villain that was the life of me.

Then Chapter two the story changed another writer penned
Down his name.
He saw in me what no one did, took what was dying and made it live.
It's hard to believe everything you read, but the proof is
In what you see in chapter two.

Going nowhere in the fast lane, seemed like a road with no end.
I cursed at the sunset, hoped it would never rise again.
Every sense of emotion had vanished in me it seemed.
With the candle, burning at both ends it was a matter of time for me.

The Crabb Family,"(1st Verse)
One night while on life's raging sea it looked as if I would suffer defeat.
As the blackness of night closed off the light my heart sank with fear.
My desperate cry rang out with fright; all I could see was no hope in sight.
With faith all but gone I met the one who came looking for me.

(Chorus)
He came looking for me, He came looking for me.
He made a way when there was no way that I could see.
When I drifted so far Jesus was near to rescue my soul and calms all my fears.
Now I'm safe from all harm since I met the one who came looking for me.

(2nd Verse)
Satan had already picked out my grave, his plan was to foil and put me away.
I'd drifted so far, would anyone care that I'd soon be lost.
I knew my destruction was a matter of time but Jesus appeared and said this one is mine.
Now I'm safe with no harm for he walked through the storm
When he was looking for me.

You've got to lay it down,turn your back to it all.

But you've got to let it go, put it down,and just walk away.

(Verse 2)
You know that sin is a prison that locks you away.
It takes all your freedom with a price you can't pay.
But your pardon was granted if you'll only beleive.
The friend of sinners bore your shame,
So you could go free.

(bridge)
Walk away don't you ever look back,
Get free from that ole tie that binds.

(2nd chorus)

You've got to let it go and leave it at the cross.
You've got to lay it down,turn your back to it all.
Your freedom tomorrow is accomished today.
But you've got to let it go, put it down,and just walk away.

The Crabb Family,"Verse 1
Two friends were talking about God's wonderful grace and love
One came from a Christian home, the other's life was tough
One met Jesus as a child one, was scared from all he'd been
Though their lives were different, you would hear from each
Of them
Chorus
You can't imagine what the Lord has done for me. I try to
Tell you but I doubt that I could ever make you see. What
Would I do without Him where on Earth would I be
You can't imagine what the lord has done for me.
Verse 2
If we were sharing, about the road we traveled here,
We've come from separate worlds, but mercy brought us near
No matter what we've done, we're on common ground today
At the cross of Jesus, every one of us can say
Chorus
You can't imagine what the Lord has done for me. I try to
Tell you, but I doubt that I could ever make you see. What
Would I do without Him, where on Earth would I be
You can't imagine what the Lord has done for me.
Oh you can't imagine what the Lord has done for me.

To half the questions his son asked him

Brokenhearted
Looking up at Him
And said why are You doing this
He looks down at her wanting to hold her
And wipe her tears away
But he has to leave that's just the way it is

No one knows how much I care
But when you put your arms around me
I get a feeling that's hard to bear

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight

Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
Cause I know you're gonna treat me right

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, ""Daddy, oh, don't you dare""

He gives me fever, with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever I'm his missus
So Daddy won't you treat him right

Everybody's got the fever
That is something we all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever Started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said ""Julie, baby, you're my flame""

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Well, now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
The Cramps were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade

We give you fever, when we rock you
Fever 'till you live and learn
Fever 'till you sizzle

The Cranberries,"It was a fearful night of December 8th 
He was returning home from the studio late 
He had perceptively known that it wouldn't be nice 
Because in 1980, he paid the price 
John Lennon died
With a Smith and Wesson 38 
John Lennon's life was no longer a debate 
He should have stayed at home 
He should have never cared 
The man who took his life declared: 
He said, ""I just shot John Lennon, 
I just shot John Lennon"" 
What a sad and sorry and sickening sight 
What a sad and sorry and sickening night.",I Just Shot John Lennon

I'm still remembering the time

Because you were not there

I need your affection all the way 
The world has changed 
Or I've changed in a way 
I try to remain, 
I'm trying not to go insane 
I need your affection all the way

I'm still remembering my life 
Before I became your wife 
I'm still remembering the pain 
And the mind games 
Reverse psychology 
Never tainted me 
I didn't sell my soul, 
I didn't sell my soul

I need your affection all the way

Rise to the top 
They say the good people 
Are always first to drop

Will his presence still remain?

I sat on your chair by the fire 
Transfixed in a stare, taking me higher

Mind the war child, we should mind the war child

He was sleeping on the streets and homeless,
he said ""I fought in Vietnam""
Beneath his shirt he wore the mark, he bore the bark

He sees I and I sees he
Old man sweet as the fruit he's picking
Knows the rhythm of nature's ticking

Gives a smile of tooth and metal
Winks an eye like a falling petal
Face, a furrowed field of life
Tracks the years of the living knife

He I love
He I know
Seasons come
So fruitman go

Through the crowd I enter in
See the head of virgin skin
Frail, the old man's hand I take
Peace be with you, Sunday shake

Sweet old man he turns to me
Tries to tell me what's to be

You'll disapear and then I'll die
A love that lost always returns
To feed the fire of a heart that burns
There's no sleep for fury eyes
So deep are the eyes of fury
Watching faces changing places
Running rings around the moon
Exchanging glances taking chances
Did we laugh and see to sing too soon
Our stomach turn on a fever stream
But with no mosquito bite
Rabid kisses in a dream
Still we can't escape the site
There's no sleep for fury eyes
So deep are the eyes of fury
Tonight they exorcise the ghost
Of love from its unyielding host
If that don't suit you scream and shout
It thine offend thee pluck it out
Alone in love with the other one
The one who doesn't know
And when we dance with the other one
The eyes of fury glow
Tonight they exorcise the ghost
Of love from its unyielding host
If that don't suit you scream and shout

Beholding love a thing of beauty

Let man's machines collapse and rust

Been so long here... I could die here 
Lying by your side 
But time won't claim me, time and me only

Who needs the days to trouble to fill? 
If the moon didn't rise, I wouldn't be upset 
Who needs moonshine to cause tears to spill?

I want to turn blue under an alien sun

With oceans of methane and petrified grass

Let's live on the dot
See the bad moon rising in a lunacy knot

Come one let's do Pluto

An unleaded dream drive to the prettiest star

'Til the world turns to meet its plutonium fate

Beckoning me with urgency

Free at last of the city sounds
Free at last to put my foot right down

",Ancient History
The Cribs,"One of those fucking, awful black days
When nothing is pleasing and everything that happens
Is an excuse for anger
An outlet for emotions stockpiled, an arsenal, an armor

These are the days when I hate the world
Hate the rich, hate the happy
Hate the complacent, the TV watchers
Beer drinkers, the satisfied ones

Because I know I can be all of those little hateful things
And then I hate myself for realizing that
There's no preventative, directive or safe approach for living
We each know our own fate

We know from our youth, how to be treated
How we'll be received, how we shall end
These things don't change

You can change your clothes
Change your hairstyle, your friends, cities, continents
But sooner or later your own self will always catch up
Always it waits in the wings

Ideas swirl but don't stick
They appear but then run off like the rain on the windshield

One of those rainy day car rides, my head implodes
The atmosphere in this car, a mirror of my skull
Wet, damp, windows dripping and misted with cold
Walls of grey, nothing good on the radio, not a thought in my head

I know a place we can go and I'm falling
Love so hard that you wish you were ten

Lets take life and slow it down incredibly slow
Frame by frame
With two minutes that take ten years to live out
Yeah, let's do that

Telephone poles like praying mantis against the sky
Metal arms outstretched
So much land traveled, so little sense made of it
It doesn't mean a thing, all this land laid out behind us

I'd like to take off into these woods and get good and lost for a while
I'm disgusted with petty concerns
Parking tickets, breakfast specials
Does someone just have to carry this weight?

Abstract typography, methane covenant
Linear gospel, Nashville sales lady, stocky emissary
Torturous lice, mad Elizabeth

Chemotherapy bullshit

The light within you shines like a diamond mine
Like an unarmed walrus, like a dead man face down on the highway
Like a skunk, eating it's own tail
Steam turbine, frog farm

Two full closets burst open in disarray, soap bubbles in the sun
Hospital death bed, red convertible, shopping list, blow job
Deaths head, devils dancing, bleached white buildings, memories 
Movements, the movie, unfeeling, unreeling, about to begin

I know a place we can go and I'm falling
Love so hard that you wish you were ten

I've seen your hallway, you're a darn call away
I've hear your stairs creak, I can fix my mind on your yes
And your no, I'll film your face today in the sparkling canals
All red, yellow, blue, green brilliance and silver Dutch reflection

Racing thoughts, racing thoughts, all too real
You're moving so fast now, I can't hold your image
This image I have of your face by the window
Me standing beside you, arm on your shoulder
A catalog of images, flashing glimpses then gone again

Until to the posters soak in me, every clear afternoon now
I'll think of you, up in the air, twisting your heel
Your knees up around me, my face in your hair
You scream so well, your smile so loud, it still rings in my ears

I know a place we can go and I'm falling
Love so hard that you wish you were ten

Imitation, distant, tired of longing, clean white teeth
Stay the course, hold the wheel, steer on to freedom
Open all the boxes, open all the boxes
Open all the boxes, open all the boxes

Times Square Midday, newspaper buildings
News headlines going around, you watch as they go
And hope there's some good ones, those tree shadows in the park
They're all whispering, shake some leaves

Around six p.m., shadows across the cobblestones
Girl in front of bathroom mirror, she slowly and carefully
Paints her face green and mask like
Like my cheese, portrait with green stripe

Long shot through apartment window
A monologue on top but no girl in shot
The light within me shines like a diamond mine

Like an unarmed walrus
Like a dead man face down on the highway
Like a snake eating its own tail
A steam turbine, frog farm

Clouds in a Bombay Sapphire coma
Been several shades of broken
Ever since I disowned her

I wanted to be with my woman
In a sensimilia haze
I wanted to go to the white fluffy clouds
And start the happy days

I was just a has-been, gone there, done that, got the T-shirt
She laughed when I told her, ""I was seriously hurt""
She said, ""Don't want your money, pain comes free
You hooked up with pain, when you hooked up with me""

Wanted to go to the white fluffy clouds
Utopia granted my wish
But when I looked under the blankets
I saw the legs of a fish

I wanted to be with my woman
In a sensimilia haze
I wanted to go to the white fluffy clouds
And start the happy days

The Crimson Armada,"Come crumbling as the shattering of faith he who cannot stand for his Lord will sleep forever without wake. And among us are the faithless who long only for the glory of this world. Among us are faithless but I am not of them for I long only to die in His arms. In the eyes of God I am His testament. The wool is warm with comfort but this is coated in deception for the sheep will soon be stripped and it will freeze without protection. Bare blooded and ripe for failure. This is where all are defined by His will. Thy knees will testify, did he stand to the throne? The pigs drown spiraling alone. Arrogant, the goblet raise you high, the portrait of perfection. Do you not see this pride itself is an infection? Nigh is the hour when trumpets will close the graves and may those who stood for their Lord rejoice, let cowards sink and settle for remorse. On tables stretched horror stares, to rape our lungs of precious air. Three times to the skies our hands we raise: Reverse this curse, this violent plague. It is infectious, the dispersion of bone of the spineless. Live like a wordless dog, may you forever remain silent. Or stand for His throne. Relieve the world of its infectious ailment. In the eyes of God I am his testament. Come crumbling for without God, one exists without meaning. We are his testament serving as the heart and flesh. When one part of this body aches we seek to cure its distress. We are the testament.",In the Eyes of God
The Critters,"Just a breeze will muss your hair
But you smile away each little care
And if the rain should make you blue
You say tomorrow is a new
Blue be your eyes, blonde your hair
You realize beyond a care
Life's in a hurry, but
You've got no worry, you're
So mystifyingly glad
I'm Mr. Dieingly Sad

And when the leaves begin to fall
Answering old winter's call
I feel my tears, they fall like rain
Weeping forth the sad refrain
Blue, dark, and dim it may seem
You mark a grin, a moonbeam
Brightens your smile, pray tell me
How all the while you can be
So mystifyingly glad
I'm Mr. Dieingly Sad

You say ""take my hand and walk with me
Wake this land and stop the sea
Show me love, unlock
All doors
I'm yours""

Then the tide rolls up to shore
I whisper low, ""I love you more
More than even you could know""
Adore me do so I could show
I'm so mystifyingly glad

The Crown,"Watch out!

The night is magic, metal-electric
Your mind goes manic, wild and satanic
600 souls of blasphemy, tonight we set the power free
In flashing lights and violent sound
Where bodies rain and faces scream!

God Shock! Devil Lust!
Electric night
Come and let those fuckin' demons out now!
Let it out! Come let yourself go! Go insane!

Driven to insanity, I am what you think
Adrenaline rush, going totally blind
Energy, aggression, mayhem and chaos
Harder and faster, ain't gonna give in
An explosion of deathnoise, a shockwave of power
This is the way we take our revenge!

God Shock! Devil Rock!
Electric storm
Come and let it blow your mind away now!

Blasting at motorspeed, like iron angels on the lead
Loudest shit you've ever heard
Yeah... the screaming out the soul inside
No future baby... we're going down
But I'll always remember those electric nights

God Shock! Demon Rush!

Come and let the Devil in now honey!
Let Him in!
And let's raise some Hell tonight!
Hell tonight... let it burn!

The Crown,"Can't you see that death does want me?!

I can't explain, you won't understand
The dream is gone, the falling deep
Under the spell, spoken in tongues
In the colors... of Hell.
In the ringing that chimes inside me
So drag me down, deeper still
Far beyond the black horizon, beyond the things you know!

Poison, the poison, the poison
Poison, the poison, the poison demon!

I am lost again, everything's gone
And more alone than I ever have been
Out of my mind and down on my knees
I'm losing more than I'll ever get
And even if you want to, you can't ever help me
Nor can I ever hope to reach you
But I love to fall... Need the rush
So don't pray for my soul 'cause I'm already damned!

Poison, the poison, the poison
Poison, the poison, the poison devil!

I am down again, everything lost
And more gone than I ever have been
I'm not here to stay, not made to last
Total destruction is the way for me!

And when I kill, I kill!
When I kill, I really kill!
Yeah, when I kill, I kill!
So I take the poison even though I know that it kills!

Treachery... I will betray you all
With a poisoned kiss, filled with deceit
Smiling turning my back
And leaving you all behind
In chaos, and drunk in desperation
Trying to escape this meaningless life
A child of death, playing with fire
So sing for my soul 'cause I cannot be saved!

Poison, the poison, the poison god!

Blood of divine, holier than mine...Wine of Delight I drink to ease my guilt.
Hoping to see bodies to bleed. Hoping to see the beautiful art I've built.

Pose! Pose naked with blood as your skin!
Crawl! Crawl hated, my expression of sin!

Die, die, die, die!

Drain! Drain your soul with the wounds I provide!
Take! Take your place in my gallery and die!

Feel...your breath: getting stabbed away!
Our heartbeats...synchronized...while I make you pay!
Never...again...shall you spread your filth!
Bleeding...heart sympathy...shall you never get, from me!

How can the rest just live in silence
When the children are being injected with their rotting venom?
Led to death with 'belief' as the guiding light!
Trust and Deceit, hand in hand. Born into slavery
Nailed on these walls are the scum of humanity
Parasites of life left for generations...to see!

Straight down to Hell I will go, I'll take you down with me...
One last statue I'll put on there, showing the face of vengeance!

Feel...your life...getting washed away!
Our heartbeats...synchronized...while I make you pay!
Never...again...shall you spread your filth!

Deep roots are not reached by the frost From the ashes a flame shall be woken From the shadows a new
Light shall spring Renewed is the hope that was broken As the crownless again shall be king
Harmony and blasphemy As one with the light and the void Beyond sun and stars
Luscious - Gorgeous by pound Through honey crush produced Flood eternity and its whispered moan
I dream a thousand diamonds Delirous mind Leave the symphony behind

Scream like life under light As your soul's being dragged through 365 chambers of pain

Why soar time Delicate moments of hazy tripping Above and about When after swimmed away
As some melting wax ANd their ugly frantic worship Is easy gone
As rust rose Next shadow nears Raw and repulsive
Our lives ache As the sweet days recall Love always drives your head Show my one true road

Pain, self-afflicted pain, is always there to pull me back again

To consume all our being In one great laughter

Why not always live - In that aura of magic That gives every moment - Its weight of wonder
That always is found - In that final hour When life is a dream - Already over
Grow back those silent wings of holy pride That the wheels of the world keep on breaking down
Awake from your sleep - It is time! Cause life is a dream...
...Already over!
Beauty and strength, leaping laughter, force and fire - Are of us
Feast and rejoice! Every day and night - In your hearts Pleasures of uttermost delight
Knowledge and rapture - No dread hereafter
Every end is a new beginning - When one door is closed another is open In the pure joy of existence
And its kisses of eternal esctasy Lose is the law - Love under will As the dogs of reason
Perish with the fall of because
I can tell from the sorrow in your smile That there is nothing left to believe in - For you
Nihil Rise - For me Freedom lies!

The Crown Royals,"Once there was a wicked witch in the lovely land of Oz
And a wickeder, wickeder, wickeder witch there never, never was
She filled the folks in Munchkin land with terror and with dread
'Till one fine day from Kansas way a cyclone caught a house 
That brought the wicked, wicked witch her doom 
As she was flying on her broom
For the house fell on her head and the coroner pronounced her dead
And thru the town the joyous news was spread
 
Ding-dong, the witch is dead! Which old witch? The wicked witch
Ding-dong, the wicked witch is dead
Wake up, you sleepy head, rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up, the wicked witch is dead!
She's gone where the goblins go below, below, below, yo ho
Let's open up and sing, and ring the bells out
Ding-dong! the merry-o sing it high, sing it low
Let them know the wicked witch is dead

The songs of the past bring back memories of you
I always remember the first night we met
The songs they were playing I never will forget

I always will treasure them so close to my heart
They always will haunt me although we're apart
Each time that I hear them a tear's bound to fall
For I love those memories that I, I recall

Those oldies but goodies reminds me of you
The songs of the past bring back memories of you
Forever they will haunt me but what can I do
Those oldies but goodies reminds me of you

Yes, dear, they are playin' our songs
And they will always remain our songs
And each time you hear them, I hope you too will cherish
The wonderful memories that our love once knew
For these songs are just a symbol of the love that I had for you

The Cruel Sea,"In the lonely streets of every town
In the home of Mr. Jones
The men all sell their souls to love
But their women sleep alone

The women sell their love
For cheap. for security
They take a lot of shit just to get their bit
But nothing comes for free

Oh, don't sell your love
Oh, don't sell your love too cheap
In the flea bit ridden crossroads
Of the fallin' livin' streets
Old men stare and women wear
Clothes that make them weep

At the burnin' and of a satellite town
Where windows smash or shine
Lovers bleed take what they need
From the deaf dumb and the blind

Oh, don't sell your love
Oh, don't sell your love too cheap

Sometimes I get my feet stuck so hard in the ground
It's like diggin' a hole, just standin' around
Every single fuckin' day that goes by, I miss too of
My friends outside are gettin' fewer and fewer

And I feel like I'm sittin' on a human sewer
Mother fuckin' nature like I never ever knew her
Make the same mistakes over and over again
And I stop to explode all over my friends

I'm so scared now, I don't know who I am
I guess I'm a man, yeah, I'm only human
I've got no fuckin'' strength of body and mind
'Cause the days go on just like I'm doin' time
There's a soul suckin' strap at the top of my spine
I gotta get straight walk a straight line

Everywhere you look today there are people livin' lies
If they can't get the truth they want
They're quick to compromise
Suck a little bit here, suck a little bit there
Till they think they're satisfied
But their hunger for the real thing
Keeps them crawlin' back inside

The Crusaders,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

The Crusaders,"Willie and Laura Mae Jones were our neighbors a long time back
They lived right down the road from us in a shack, just like our shack
The people worked the land together, and we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land you don't have the time to think about another man's coulour

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time

We'd sit out on the front porch in the evenin' when the sun went down
Willie would play and the kids would sing and everybody would mess around
And Daddy bring on his guitar, we'd play all through the night
And every now and then ol' Willie would grin and say
'Hey you play alright' (and that made me feel so good)

I remember the best times of all when Saturday came around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
'Do y'all need anything from town?'
He'd say 'No, but why don't cha all stop on your way back through
And I'll get Laura Mae to cook us some barbecue (you know, they good)'

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time

The years rolled past our land, and took back what they'd given
We all knew we'd have to move if we were gonna make a livin'
So we all moved on and went about our separate ways
Sure it was hard to say goodbye to Willie and Laura Mae (Jones), oh yeah

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)

Don't know if I'm waking or I'm dreaming
Riding with Fats Waller on the Super Chief
He said, musics real, the rest is seeming

Oh, deep pain
Feeling that won't go away
There's the sound of his soul in the air
I can hear it up there
And I know he left those soul shadows
On my mind, on my mind, on my mind

Soul shadows on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
Soul shadows on my mind
On my mind, on my mind

Standing by the window as a fog rolls in
I swear I can hear a far-off music
Jelly Roll is playing down in Storyville
And Satchmo is wailing in Chicago
You ought to heard 'em play
Feelings that won't go away
Left the sound of their souls in the air
I hear out there and I know

They left them soul shadows all on my mind

She's gone with changing her hair 
She laughs and she cries 
And her mind seems to be 
A worried and jumbled affair 
Well, I have talked to Mary, I've searched her eyes 
And if you ask of Mary she'll tell you why. 
It's Mary's time to run, 
With the mad, with the sane, 
With the joy and the pain, 
Till she finds her place in the sun.

And each song they know can help them to grow.

And warn her as we may she just won't listen any more

The Cryan' Shames,"First day of August
Last rain was in May
When the rainmaker came to Kansas
In the middle of a dusty day

The rainmaker said to the people
""Tell me what you are prepared to pay""
And the rainmaker said to the people
""Now I'll conjure up a rain today.""

Ninety degrees 'neath the trees where it's shady
A hundred and ten in the hot sun
Heat from the street burned the feet of the ladies
See how they run.

Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
Called down the lightnin'
By a mystical name
And the rainmaker called on the thunder
And then it suddenly began to rain.

Then the rainmaker passed his hat to the people
But the people all turned away
And the rainmaker's eyes and the Kansas skies
Well they both became a darker gray.

First day in August
Last rain was in May
When the rainmaker came to Kansas
In the middle of a dusty day.

The rainmaker smiled as he hitched up his wagon
And without a word he rode away
And the people of the town heard the sound of his laughter
And they knew the rain had come to stay.

Over means that fall so fast

We'll take one more glance till the story is cold

And once you get the hunger then you can't turn back

This is a sad day
The saddest day I've ever known
We swore to hold our heads up high
We swore we'd look away

Its just another bad dance of the sick and the tired
We memorize these lines, pretend that we're friends
With no consequence so we know how it ends

Any hint of trouble there's a camera awaiting
Every way you turn there goes another flash
We cling to the wreckage it's our guilty pleasure
And once you get the hunger then you can't turn back

This is a sad day, this could be the day we say 
I will not be a part of this at least just for today
Its hard to pick though, the reaction is mixed
I gotta get some bad news gotta get me a fix

Get structure like a pyramid, fucked ya when ya weary 
Water in the hog thick like sackfog pass me a dollar if ya hear me

[chorus 4x]

Too many politicians, businessmen, policemen
On some anti-us mission
We're lockin the subs the best solution
Can't hustle tapes without getting hassled by somebody
Hand out flyers and get harassed by somebody
In Sac Town if your creative that's a crime 
And they got it locked down so you can mentally do the time
And you could say who why don't ya but that would be a pity 
but there would be no more Hip-Hop in River City

Dressed in white and slowly dreaming
Stops all time
I slow my steps and start to blur
So many years have filled my heart
I never though I'd say those words

Further we go
And older we grow
The more we know
The less we show

The very first time I saw your face
I thought of a song and quickly changed the tune
The very first time I touched your skin
I thought of a story and rushed to reach the end too soon

Oh remember
Please don't change

And so the fall came thirteen years
A shiny ring and how I could forget your name
The air no longer in my throat
Another perfect lie is choked
But it always feels the same

And reconcile our bitterness

We have to, we have to break
Break, break, break
Wash away, wash away

It's form this loneliness
And the fear it brings
That new doors can open up
And be a savior to me

So open my mind

Open my heart
It's the only way to breathe

It's just a trick of the lights she said
So don't panic, now don't panic

It's from this place we'll find our peace
And reconcile our emptiness

The Cure,"It doesn't matter if we all die 
Ambition in the back of a black car 
In a high building there is so much to do 
Going home time 
A story on the radio 
Something small falls out of your mouth 
And we laugh 
A prayer for something better 
A prayer 
For something better 

Please love me 
Meet my mother 
But the fear takes hold 
Creeping up the stairs in the dark 

Waiting for the death blow 
Waiting for the death blow 
Waiting for the death blow 
Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot 
Fighting for freedom on the television 
Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs 
Have we got everything? 
She struggles to get away

The pain 
And the creeping feeling 
A little black haired girl 
Waiting for Saturday 
The death of her father pushing her 
Pushing her white face into the mirror 
Aching inside me 
And turn me round 
Just like the old days 
Just like the old days 
Just like the old days 
Just like the old days 

Caressing an old man 
And painting a lifeless face 
Just a piece of new meat in a clean room 
The soldiers close in under a yellow moon 
All shadows and deliverance 
Under a black flag 
A hundred years of blood 
Crimson 
The ribbon tightens round my throat 
I open my mouth 
And my head bursts open 
A sound like a tiger thrashing in the water 
Thrashing in the water 
Over and over 
We die one after the other 
Over and over 
We die one after the other 
One after the other 
One after the other 
One after the other 
One after the other 

It feels like a hundred years 
A hundred years 
A hundred years 
A hundred years 
A hundred years 
One hundred years",One Hundred Years (Studio Demo)
The Cure,"Give me your eyes that I might see
Blind man kissing my hands
The sun is humming my head turns to dust
As he plays on his knees
As he plays on his knees

The sand and the sea grows
I close my eyes
Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away on a strange day

And I laugh as I drift in the wind
Blind dancing on a beach of stone
Cherish the faces as they wait for the end
A sudden hush across the water
And we're here again

The sand and the sea grows
I close my eyes
Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away on a strange day

[Incomprehensible]
And the sky and the impossible explode

Held for one moment I remember a song
An impression of sound
Then everything is gone forever

Strange day

The Cure,"Get away from me
Get your fingers out of my face
This room's so hot
This room's so hot

I break the walls
Get away from me
Leave me alone
Like the pig on the stairs
Hanging
In a groovy purple shirt

Gasping for air
I'm gasping for air
I'm gasping for love
I'm gasping for air...

Slit the cats like cheese
Then eat the sweet sticky things
Suck harder!
Suck harder!
Suck your insides
Insides out!

Blood thick swimming round your feet
As you're choking
Choking
Choking on the fleshy words

Give me it give me it give me it
Deaden my glassy mind
Give me it give me it
Make me blind
One step back and one step down
And slip the needles in my side...

My head is cold
My hands are cold
My heart is cold
My heart is black
And stops every fucking night
Every night
I wait until it stops...

Sing birds sing birds sing birds sing
Get away...",Give Me It
The Cure,"Ha ha ha
Wake up in the dark
The after-taste of anger in the back of my mouth
Spit it on the wall
And cough some more
And scrape my skin with razor blades

And make up in the new blood
And try to look so good
Follow me
Make up in the new blood
And follow me to where the real fun is
Ha ha ha

As stale and selfish as a sick dog
Spurning sex like an animal of god
I'll tear your red hair by the roots
And hold you blazing
Hold you cherished in the dead electric light

Your face
I'll never see you this way again
I captured it so perfectly
As if I knew you'd disappear away

You howl and hit me again

Wakes me in the dark
And cuts me from my throat to my pounding heart
My heart
My shaking heart
My howl my shake dog

Oh shake dog shake
Shake shake
Shake dog shake

But we slept all night in the virgin's bed
And dreamed of death
And breathed like sick dogs
We slept all night in the virgin's bed
And breathed like death
And dreamed of sick dogs

The Cure,"You're too far away
Too far away to touch
And this mother's love inside me
Hurts too much

Prettily waving
Playing on the sand
Dreaming of everything
Dancing

Dancing in our hands
Dancing
Dancing

Dizzy dizzy dizzy
As I speak
Like a tumbling cat
I watch in fascination

Like a vampire bat

Don't give it away

We'll use it up tomorrow
If we don't use it today

Rest your head

All wrapped up in ribbons

The queen of Siam in my arms
Remember the time that the islands sank?

Remember that time that the trees fell down?
The wood crashing through the wall
Remember the sound that could wake the dead?
But nobody woke up at all

Somebody died for this
Somebody died for just one kiss
Just one kiss

Remember the time that the sky went black?
We waited alone on the sands
Remember the taste of the raging sea?
But nobody held out their hands

Somebody died for this
Somebody died for just one kiss
Just one kiss, just one kiss, just one kiss",Just One Kiss
The Cure,"Today there was a tragedy
Underneath the bridge
A man walked
Cold and blue
Into La Ment
The sky coloured perfect
As the man slipped away
Waving with a last vanilla smile...

Somewhere at a table
Two drowned fools
Smoking
Drinking water as they talked
Of how they loved our lady
And oh! the smell as candles die...

One more ice cream river body
Flowed underneath the bridge
Underneath the bridge",Lament
The Cure,"It was only yesterday
Waving arms across the street
Your white face left me blue

We drink each other dry

The Cure,"I love it all
These games we play
I close my eyes
You run away

I'm sure I asked you to stay
But now you're gone
And so I feel the grey
Pulse in my head

I turn off the lights and crawl into bed
I try to think of sunshine
But my body goes wet
With the first crash of thunder

I don't think I can know
Anyone but you dear
That's for sure

When it gets to four
It's my turn to go
Oh the kiss
So alcoholic and slow

Arranging me for Saturday
I thought you would know
That I always sleep
Alone

I don't think I can know
Anyone but you
Dear
That's for sure

The upstairs room is cool and bright
We can go up there in summer
And dance all night

So everyone jumped up
And then fell over again

And stare at me",The Upstairs Room

Always away

Song the routine from laughter land
16 white legs and a row of teeth
I watch you in secrecy

Your dying for the hope is gone
From here we go nowhere again
I'm trapped in my face and i'm changing
Too much
I can't climb out the way i fell in

Jump with me
For that old forgotten dance
The midnight sun will burn you up
Your life is cold
Your life is hot
Your life's too much for words

These occasions are such a relief
Another point another view to send
We start to talk
And it's all so safe

Through seas of prayer
Through twisting hands and choking air

I circled...

Tell yourself, it couldn't happen

Or we can roll around
And find out upside down, oh

A few hours after this and we're apart again
Like two white checks, like opposite poles
In a secret game
Like nothing like these I suppose

I really should have known by the cut of your smile

Of death in the pool
Wakes me up at quarter to three
I'm lying on the floor of the night before
With a stranger lying next to me
A nightmare of you
Of death in the pool
I see no further now than this dream
The trembling hand of the trembling man

Hold my mouth
To hold in a scream
I try to think
To make it slow
If only here is where I go
If this is real
I have to see
I turn on fire
And next to me
It looks good
It tastes like nothing on earth
It looks good
It tastes like nothing on earth
Its so smooth it even feels like skin

Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?

A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

Cata cata cata

Flowing in
And filling up my hopeless heart
Oh never never go
Dust my lemon lies
With powder pink and sweet

Is the day you change
And fly away from me

You glow inside my head
You hold me hypnotized

Charlotte sometimes

Night after night she lay alone in bed
Her eyes so open to the dark
The streets all looked so strange
They seemed so far away
But Charlotte did not cry

The people seemed so close
Playing expressionless games
The people seemed so close

She hopes to open shadowed eyes
On a different world
Come to me scared princess
Charlotte sometimes

On that bleak track
(see the sun is gone again)
The tears were pouring down her face
She was crying and crying for a girl
Who died so many years before

Sometimes I dream
The sounds all stay the same

Charlotte sometimes dreams a wall around herself
But it's always with love
With so much love it looks like
Everything else

The Cure,"I've waited hours for this,
I've made myself so sick 
I wish I'd stayed asleep today,
I never thought this day would end 
I never thought tonight could ever be
This close to me

Just try to see in the dark,
Just try to make it work,
To feel the fear before you're here 
I make the shapes come much too close,
I pull my eyes out,
Hold my breath,
And wait until I shake

But if I had your faith,
Then I could make it safe and clean 
If only I was sure,
That my head on the door was a dream

At the Arab on the ground

But I hear no sound

I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an Arab

I can turn 
And walk away
Or I can fire the gun

Staring at the sun
Whichever I chose
It amounts to the same
Absolutely nothing

I'm dead

I'm shaking like milk
Turning
Turning blue
All over the windows and the floors
Fires outside in the sky
Look as perfect as cats

But it's just the same
A stupid game

But I don't care if you don't
And I don't feel if you don't
And I don't want it if you don't
And I won't say it
If you won't say it first

You think you're tired now
But wait until three
Laughing at the Christmas lights
You remember from December
All of this then back again

Another name
Stay alive but stay the same
It's just the same

And I don't feel if you don't
And I don't want it if you don't
And I won't say it
If you won't say it first

You can't even see now
So you ask me the way
You wonder if it's real
Because it couldn't be rain
Through the right doorway
And into the white room
It used to be the dust that would lay here
When I came here alone

We couldn't get closer than this
The way we walk
The way we talk
The way we stalk
The way we kiss
We slip through the streets

Getting bigger and sleeker
And wider and brighter
We bite and scratch and scream all night
Let's go and throw
All the songs we know

Into the sea
You and me
All these years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring
It's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the lovecats
We missed you hissed the lovecats

We're so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully
Wonderfully pretty!
Oh you know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other to tea huh?
We should have each other with cream
Then curl up by the fire
And sleep for awhile

As you walk away

I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night

For always and ever is always for you
Your trust
The most gorgeously stupid thing I ever cut in the world

Say it every time you move
The way that you look at me now
Makes me wish I was you

The Cure,"I called you after midnight
Then ran until I burst
I passed the howling woman
And stood outside your door
We walked around the lake
And woke up in the rain
And everyone turned over
Troubled in their dreams again

Visiting time is over
And so we walk away
And both play dead then cry out loud
Why we always cry this way?

I kissed you in the water
And made your dry lips sing
I saw you look
Like a Japanese baby
In an instant I remembered everything

I called you after midnight
Then ran until my heart burst
I passed the howling woman

Yes I'd see her when the day got colder
On those days when it felt like snow
You know I even think that she stared like you
She used to just stand there and stare
And roll her eyes right up to heaven
And make like I just wasn't there

And she used to fall down a lot
That girl was always falling
Again and again
And I used to sometimes try to catch her
But I never even caught her name

And sometimes we would spend the night
Just rolling about on a floor
And I remember
Even though it felt soft at the time
I always used to wake up sore

You know I even think that she smiled like you
She used to just stand there and smile
And her eyes would go all sort of far away
And stay like that for quite a while

And I remember she used to fall down a lot
That girl was always falling

Well I'll try and explain

You remember that day in Paris
When we wandered through the rain
And promised to each other
That we'd always think the same
And dreamed that dream
To be two souls as one

And stopped just as the sun set
And waited for the night
Outside a glittering building
Of glittering glass and burning light

And in the road before us
Stood a weary grayish man
Who held a child upon his back
A small boy by the hand
The three of them were dressed in rags
And thinner than air
And all six eyes stared fixedly on you

[Chorus]
The father's eyes said ""Beautiful!
How beautiful you are!""
The boy's eyes said
""How beautiful!
She shimmers like a star!""
The child's eyes uttered nothing
But a mute and utter joy
And filled my heart with shame for us
At the way we are

I turned to look at you
To read my thought upon your face
And gazed so deep into your eyes
So beautiful and strange
Until you spoke
And showed me understanding is a dream
""I hate these people staring
Make them go away from me!""

And this is why I hate you
And how I understand
That no-one ever knows or loves another

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

And I'm kissing you hard 
Like I've got very important business 
And no-one knows 
And no-one sees us 
Because they're drinking themselves senseless 

And I'm writhing 
And I'm writhing 
And I'm writhing in the snakepit 
Well I'm out in a car 
And it's just full of stupid girls 

And I've forgotten how to speak 
And I just can't remember a word 
And my eyes feel like they're bursting 
And they're splitting like plums 

And I'm writhing 
And I'm writhing 
And I'm writhing in the snakepit",The Snakepit
The Cure,"For how much longer can I howl into this wind? 
For how much longer

For how much longer can I howl into this wind?",A Thousand Hours
The Cure,"I'm in the room without a light 
The room without a view 
I'm here for one more treacherous night 
Another night with you 
It tortures me to move my hands 
To try to move at all 
And pulled 
My skin so tight it screams 
And screams and screams 
And pulls some more 
Hanging like this 
Like a vampire bat 
Hanging like this 
Hanging on your back 
I'm helpless again 

My body is cut and broken 
It's shattered and sore 
My body is cut wide open 
I can't stand anymore 
It tortures me to move my hands 
To try to move at all 
And pulled 
My skin so tight screams 
And screams and screams 
And screams some more 

Hanging like this 
Like a vampire bat 
Hanging like this hanging on your back 
Oh it's torture 
And I'm almost there 
It's torture 
But I'm almost there 

It's torture 
But I'm almost there 
It's torture 
But I'm almost there",Torture
The Cure,"Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me

And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the ending would be

So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over

And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again

But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you and fame isn't everything
Screaming like this in the hope of sincerity
Screaming it's over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the end always is
How the end always is

I'm so glad you remembered

The blindness of happiness 
Of falling down laughing

The Cure,"On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom and
Suddenly
A movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do
When I realize with fright
That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now
Closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning I will wake up
In the shivering cold

And the Spiderman is always hungry",Lullaby [Studio Rough] [Guide Vocal] [#][Version]

Never quite managed the words to explain to you
Never quite knew how to make them believable

It's like fireworks and heaven
So you listen

And wish for nothing at all
And when the big hand sings

Leaving alone
Leaving alone I'll never
Leave alone again

As I cool in the twilight 
Taste the salt on my skin 
I recall all the tears 
All the broken words

Move slowly through drowning waves 
Going away on a strange day 

And I laugh as I drift in the wind

Dancing on a beach of stone 
Cherish the faces as they wait for the end 
Sudden hush across the water 
And we're here again 
And the sand 
And the sea grows

Move slowly through drowning waves

As the days become heavier and weighted

In the cold light
A noise
A scream tears my clothes as the figurines tighten
With spiders inside them
And dust on the lips of a vision of hell

Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs

And painting a lifeless face 
Just a piece of new meat in a clean room

All shadows and deliverance 
Under a black flag

The ribbon tightens round my throat

But it's just rain I smile
Brushing my tears away

Too many times
Too many years I've cried over you

How much more can we use it up?
Drink it dry?
Take this drug?
Looking for something forever gone
But something
We will always want?

Why why why are you letting me go? she says
I feel you pulling back
I feel you changing shape
And just as I'm breaking free
She hangs herself in front of me
Slips her dress like a flag to the floor
And hands in the sky
Surrenders it all

Curled like an embryo

A monument to the ruined age

I was all alone
Listening to
The blaze of summer

Drifting, I was falling
I was floating in a golden haze
Breathing in the sky blue sounds
Of memories of other days

And in my dreams I was a child
Flowers in my mouth and in my eyes
And I was floating through the colors of a sky
Up to the stars and angels

Up, up, up to Heaven
Up, up, up forever
Up, up, up to Heaven
Up, up, up forever

Turning in my climb
I looked down on a lake
Traced upon the water
There I saw your face

Sang in recollection
Of the times we shared
Then pushed on ever upward
To the sky

Flowers in my mouth and in my eyes

The Cure,"Rio sunrise sucking on a straw
I rub my head and stagger out the door
And head into the bright new beautiful day
And the way she pulls me in
Sucks my breath away

I asked her for some time
And she just made me it
I asked her maybe why?
And she just gave me it

Never smile
Never stare
She doesn't seem to care at all
Never cry
Never scream
She doesn't really seem to need me at all...

Fourteen weeks I stay away from home
A hundred days a part of me unknown
Apart in pink and perfect moments play
And as a wonder of the world
She sucks my breath away

I asked her for some time
And she just made me it
I asked her maybe why?
And she just gave me it
So I asked her could be heaven?
And she just prayed me it...

She didn't want to know my name
She didn't want to know how long we had together
Spending time as if tomorrow never comes
I didn't want to know the end
I didn't want to go but slowly found me home again
And slow again tomorrow comes

But it was all so far away
And so long ago
I hardly ever think about her anymore
Except sometimes when the summer twilight breeze
Carries me the scent of faraway rain

Frost pale blue

The color of a perfect day

In the mirror
As I wait for the others to call

But if I don't believe in magic
And I don't believe in blood
And I don't believe in miracles
And I don't believe in love

In a cherry tree girl
And a dust blue room?

Tonight I'll dream an hour so long
Shadow soft smiles
And everyone loves me
To open my eyes

In a drag myself face undone
Hard back into the world
Tonight I'll dream a dream I dream
Without even trying I'm flying I scream

When you say that I've aged?
Say I'm afraid

They're not tears for me
Regrets about your life
They're not regrets for me
It never turns out how you want
Why can't you see?
It all just slips away
It always slips away

So if you've got nothing left to say
Just say goodbye
Turn your face away 
And say goodbye
You know we've reached the end
You just don't know why
And you know we can't pretend

To say that I've changed? 
To say that I've aged?

And I think of what I've done
Of how I've thrown my sweetest dreams away

I will always feel regret
However hard I try 
I will never forget

The wings flew by spelled out my name

Six months went by, the summer lost
Obsessively the letters dropped into my life
The same soft, blood, smooth flowing hand

Tell you all the ways I need you; yours forever in love...""

She'd started smoking poetry!
I laughed in recognition of a favorite phrase
She'd pulled me in
I answered her
A Christmas card, in sepia
Arranging when and where
And how the two of us should meet

Her opening so well prepared
A nervous smile
I couldn't take my eyes from her
She whispered
""Can I use some of your lipstick?""
It was perfect, so believable
I couldn't help but feel that it was real
And kissing crimson fell into her waiting arms

So alone into the cold; new year without another word from her
I wrote to ask if we could maybe meet again before the spring
But weeks went by with no reply until once more my birthday came
And with it my surprise, but this time nothing was the same

The Cure,"Everyone feels good in the room she swings
Two chord cool in the head she sings
A-buzz a-buzz a-buzzing like them killer bees
Tell me this is not for real
Please tell me this is not for real

From time to time her eyes get wide
And she's always got them stuck on me
I'm surprised at how hot honey-coloured and hungry she looks
And I have to turn away to keep from bursting
Yeah I feel that good
She slips from the stage
A foot no more
But it seems to take an hour for her to reach the floor
And the two chord cool still grooves
As she slides towards me smooth as a snake
I can't swallow I just start to shake
And I just know this is a big mistake
Yeah but it feels good

Do it to me, do it to me, do it to me, do it to me
Do it to me, do it to me, do it to me

If you want I can take you on another kind of ride
Believe me I would but
Deep inside the 'but' is 'please'
I am yearning for another taste
And my shaking is 'yes'

You will be all the things in the world you've never been
See all the things in the world you've never seen
Dream all the things in the world you've never dreamed
But I think I get a bit confused
Am I seducing or being seduced?

Oh I know that tomorrow I'll feel bad
But I really couldn't care about that
She's grinning singing spinning me round and round
Smiling as I start to fall
Her face gets big her face gets small
It's like tonight I'm really not me at all

On those days when it felt like snow

You know I even think that she stared like you
She used to just stand there and stare
And roll her eyes right up to heaven
And make like I just wasn't there

And she used to fall down a lot
That girl was always falling
Again and again
And I used to sometimes try to catch her
But never even caught her name

And sometimes we would spend the night
Just rolling about on the floor (just rolling about on the floor)
And I remember even though it felt soft at the time
I always used to wake up sore

You know I even think that she smiled like you
She used to just stand there and smile
And her eyes would go all sorts of far away
And stay like that for quite a while

I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me

To feel the fear before you're here
I make the shapes come much too close
I pull my eyes out, hold my breath and wait until I shake

Then I could make it safe and clean
If only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream

As licky as trips
I can't lick that far

That swims in a works of magic show
It makes me bite my fingers through

I saw it underground
Six deep feet below the street

For a second that place was lost in space

I left that basement burning and I never went back

The second time I saw it strike
I saw it at sea
It lit up all the fish like rain
And rained them down on me
For a second that boat was still afloat
Then everything went black
I left it underwater and I never went back

Well I like it when that lightning comes
Hey hey hey
Yes I like it a lot

The third time I saw lightning strike
It hit me in bed
It threw me around and then left me for dead
For a second that room was on the moon

I'll run away with you

I kissed her face and kissed her head

Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you
That I'm in love with you

Soft and only

Lost and lonely
You
Strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes

And found myself alone, alone
Alone above a raging sea

And drowned her deep inside of me

I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile, forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

Oh Elise it doesn't matter what you do
I know I'll never really get inside of you
To make your eyes catch fire
The way they should
The way the blue could pull me in
If they only would, if they only would
At least I'd lose this sense of sensing something else
That hides away
From me and you, there're worlds to part
With aching looks and breaking hearts
And all the prayers your hands can make
Oh I just take as much as you can throw
And then throw it all away
Oh I throw it all away
Like throwing faces at the sky
Like throwing arms round

Yesterday, I stood and stared
Wide-eyed in front of you
And the face I saw looked back
The way I wanted to
But I just can't hold my tears away
The way you do

Elise believe I never wanted this
I thought this time I'd keep all of my promises
I thought you were the girl I always dreamed about
But I let the dream go
And the promises broke
And the make-believe ran out

So Elise
It doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile
Forget and make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

Like falling sand
As fast as I pick it up
It runs away through my clutching hands

There's nothing else I can really do
There's nothing else I can really do

The Cure,"On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom and
Suddenly
A movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do
When I realize with fright
That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now
Closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning I will wake up
In the shivering cold

You standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in
Holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering
You running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe
Screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage
To let it all go

You fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark

You how you used to be
Slow drowned
You were angels

Lost in admiration happy birthday I'm forever yours blossom
Faded red inside a tiny book of butterflies

The wings flew by spelled out my name

Obsessively the letters dropped into my life
The same soft blood smooth flowing hand

The year grew old incessantly she wrote to me
She'd started smoking poetry
I laughed in recognition of a favourite phrase
She'd pulled me in
I answered her
A Christmas card in sepia
Arranging when and where
And how the two of us should meet

Her opening so well prepared
A nervous smile
I couldn't take my eyes from her
She whispered
Can I use some of your lipstick?
It was perfect so believable
I couldn't help but feel that it was real
And kissing crimson fell into her waiting arms

I wrote to ask if we could maybe meet again before the spring
But weeks went by with no reply until once more my birthday came
And with it my surprise but this time nothing was the same

I was sure you'd be the one but I was wrong 
It seems reality destroys our dreams I won't forget you blossom

And I play it all again...

The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me

And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the ending would be

So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over

And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again

But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you and fame isn't everything
Screaming like this in the hope of sincerity
Screaming it's over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams

Just for a moment
Feel it inside
Feel it alive
Feel your desire

Feel it catch fire
Feel it inspire
How all you are
Is all there is

Nothing ever moves
In anything open your mind
Step out of time
Let yourself die

And your god is
Your god is
Your god

The Cure,"I'm going nowhere
Don't look so scared
I'm going nowhere

So tell me that you love me again
Tell me that you care
So tell me that you love me again

Yeah I'm going nowhere
Don't look so scared
I'm going nowhere

The Cure,"I think I've reached that point
Where giving up and going on
Are both the same dead end to me
Are both the same old song

I think I've reached that point
Where every wish has come true
And tired disguised oblivion
Is everything I do

Please stop loving me
Please stop loving me
I am none of these things

I think I've reached that point
Where all the things you have to say
And hopes for something more from me
Are just games to pass the time away

Please stop loving me
Please stop loving me
I am none of these things

I think I've reached that point
Where every word that you write
Of every blood dark sea
And every soul black night
And every dream you dream me in
And every perfect free from sin
And burning eyes
And hearts on fire
Are just the same old song

Please stop loving me
Please stop loving me
I am none of these things
I am none of these things

I am none of these things",The End of the World [CD-ROM Track]
The Cure,"Nothing left to feel 
Nothing more to do 
Nothing left to give 
Nothing more in you 
Nothing else to have or hold 
Nothing left, but time to go 
Time to go 
Years go by 
Didn't really say that much at all 
And moments just fly 
Didn't ever really touch at all 
Weeks always run down 
Didn't really get that close at all 
And days, days fall out 
Didn't ever really know at all 
And then we're here in a room too clean and too bright 
She stares at you for an hour 
You stare into the light 
for one last hour in the room 
So mean and so white 
I stare at her in this room as she stares into the night 
Nothing left to feel 
Nothing more to do 
Nothing left to ask 
Nothing more of you 
Nothing else to share or show 
Nothing left but time to go 
In his eyes as we turn no eternity of life 
In his eyes as we turn no infinity of why 
In his eyes as we turn no beautiful goodbye 
In his eyes as we turn... NOTHING BUT TEARS 
In his eyes as we turn... NOTHING BUT TEARS 
(Robert talks in a low voice:) I couldn't understand too much of what was being 
said, in a matter of minutes, 

peacefully so slow, I had to think to breath, my heart burst, we moved in 
silence really slowly away from the world, 

as we drove a strange silence, that moment, nothing will ever be the same, 
nothing will ever be the same, nothing 

will ever be the same 
Days fall out 
Weeks always run down 
Moments just fly 
Weeks go by 
And then were here 
And then we're here in a room too clean and too bright 
I stare at you for an hour 
You stare into the light 
For one last hour in the room so mean and so white 
You stare at me in this room as I stare into the night 
Nothing left to feel 
Nothing more to do 
Nothing more to take 
Nothing more from you 
Nothing else to need or know 
There's nothing left at all...but time to go",This Morning
The Cure,"So I'll wait for you
Where I always wait
Behind the signs that sell the news
I'll watch for you like yesterday

And hope for you
One day that once
Spent out on me
And up 'til late
I search for you

Your hat pushed straight
Away from me
Your measured step
Heads up you win
Always too late

If I could just once catch your eye
Invisible against the words
That hold you down in solitude
And never let you go",2 Late
The Cure,"He breaks the spell still young
Awakes from out this dream of life
And leaves us sleeping
Storm racked blind consumed

By phantom pale displays of grief
He slips from out this shadow land of pain
Where heads grow sorrow grey
And age destroys all hope

And spirits crushed
Lament and hide away

But wordless watch the soft sky smile
And breathless hear the low wind sigh
""what death may join no more let life divide""

""dream yourself awake"" he calls
""eternity awaits us all
Open your eyes and be with me
Be with me... ""

He breaks the chains still young
Dispels the hateful shades of treacherous time
And leaves us sleeping
Tortured mute

Devoured by ghostly shapes of life
He slips from ties of dust
To be the world we dream he lives
A part of everything we feel

The young and beautiful
And brave of heart

But wordless watch the soft sky smile
And breathless hear the low wind sigh
""What death may join no more let life divide""

""Dream yourself awake"" he calls
""Eternity awaits us all
Open your eyes and be with me
Be with me... ""

""Dream yourself awake"" he calls
""Eternity awaits us all
Open your eyes and be with me
Forever... """,Adonais
The Cure,"Oh nothing ever changes, nothing ever moves
And I swim around in circles in the same old lifeless room
And talk about the mirror man, the whispers in my ear again
The hot and sticky pillow man is smothering my face again

Oh nothing ever changes, nothing ever moves
And I run around hysterical in dead persistent gloom
And babble out in simile like dog, head, monkey, music me
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up and let me breathe

The Cure,"Please wake up
It's so dark and cold
Please wake up
I feel so alone

And I feel so scared
That you're going away
And I feel so scared

All I want is summer
Stories from before
Just like the time you tried to hide
Behind the churchyard wall
And fell asleep before I came
And found you in a chain of flowers

Sleeping like a marble girl
Sleeping in another world

For setting fire to bridges

To burst grin giggle bliss skip jump sing and shout

For rip-zipping button-popping kiss and well...
There's loads of other stuff can make you yell

The Cure,"The look before I go
Is the look for you
You only have to look and it will all come true
And we can fall outside
Into the fizzy night
Or pull me down in here
You know it's all the same
I only want to see if you are happy again
Or we can roll around
And find out upside down

A few hours after this and we're apart again
Like two white checks
Like opposite poles
In a secret game
(Like nothing like these I suppose)
I really should have known by the cut of your smile
That the answer would be simple
It still took you a while to get it out of me
I thought you'd do it easily

Just put your hands around my heart
And squeeze me until I'm dry
I never thought you'd ever start to ever ask me why

I never saw you again",A Few Hours After This...
The Cure,"Christabel strips
And slips like a dream
Breaking ice with arms that gleam with pain
Disdain...
She throws her head
And glides against the stream
Throwing me her bravest smile
Defiant
Glittering
Shivering guile

""Catching a cold is quick this time
But fish? 
Fish may take a while. ""

Christabel dips and slips from me
And hand pushed deep inside is suddenly free
Triumphant
Reluctantly
Struggling six legs held up for me to see

""Don't be so scared
It's nothing new
It's the same old game
Only fun with two ""
But fast and over and over
""I can't play this game with you""

Everything she tries to tell me
Leaves me open mouthed and still
Foolishly arrange tomorrow
The way I always will

Christabel trips
And grips my hand
But never to be saved 
For a second I understand
And I fall with her 

""I'll never leave you
Love you
See you change into the man I want
But it's not for long this thing
It's not for long  """,A Foolish Arrangement
The Cure,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa

I bless the rains down in Africa

(Come closer and I'll whisper)
Who was that standing in the rain?
If only I could, if only I could remember
What he said
(And how it all began)

Happy the man
With the face that smiles
Happy the man
With the face that smiles

But it has to have a name
(Something strong, something faithful, something pure)
How does he look so safe?

He'll never, he'll never turn away

He'll never turn away

But I'm laughing in your face
You're so desperate
Not to let those years of care
All go to waste

Not romance
You have to pay the price
My body may be made of fire
But my soul is made of ice

Slack jawed

When this cold and deadly

So soft
And gently breathing
Under your skin

The Cure,"I'm going back to the land of the blind
Back to the land where the sun never shines
I'm going back there and I'm hoping to find
Everything just as it was before I left it all behind

I slept at nights there hysterically
Twisted and turned but I just couldn't get free
I opened my eyes, I still couldn't see
But I could feel her, China white girl

So I get down on the floor, like I am worshiping God
Burning like a monkey
Ya, I lay down on the floor, like I am praying to the Lord
Burning like a monkey, oh

Ooh, that was a Japanese dream alright
The sound of the storm and the flickering light
And the way that her scent used to fill up the night like
Like her scent used to fill up the night

So I get down on the floor, like I am worshiping God
Burning like a monkey
Ya, I lay down on the floor, like I am praying to the Lord
Burning like a monkey

Just look at me now, just look at me this way
It looks like I am quite insane
It looks like I am trying to eat off my face
Looks like I'm going to the land of the blind anyway

Back where the sun never shines
Back to the land of the blind
Back in a Japanese dream

In a Japanese dream
",A Japanese Dream
The Cure,"""Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick
The one that makes me scream,"" she said
""The one that makes me laugh,"" she said
And threw her arms around my neck

Show me how you do it and I promise you
I promise that I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you

Spinning on that dizzy edge
I kissed her face and kissed her head
And dreamed of all the different ways I had
To make her glow

""Why are you so far away?"", she said
""Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you?
That I'm in love with you?""

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, strange as angels

Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes and found myself alone, alone

Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, just like heaven
