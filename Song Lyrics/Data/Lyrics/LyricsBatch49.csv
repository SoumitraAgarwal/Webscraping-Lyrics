Dead Can Dance,"If it were within our power,
Beyond the reach of slavish pride.
To no longer harbour grievances,
Behind the mask's opportunists facade.
We could welcome the responsibility
Like a long lost friend,
And re-establish the kingdom of laughter

In the dolls house once again.
For time has imprisoned us
In the order of our years,
In the discipline of our ways
And in the passing of momentary stillness
We can view our chaos in motion
And the subsequent collisions of fools
Well versed in the subtle art of slavery.",In the Kingdom of the Blind the One-Eyed Are Kings

",Orbis de Ignis
Dead Can Dance,"Severance,
The birds of leaving call to us,
Yet here we stand
Endowed with the fear of flight.

Overland
The winds of change consume the land,
While we remain
In the shadow of summers now past.

When all the leaves
Have fallen and turned to dust,
Will we remain
Entrenched within our ways.

Indifference,
The plague that moves throughout this land
Omen signs
In the shapes of things to come.
Tomorrow's child is the only child.",Severance
Dead Can Dance,"John Francis Dooley
Wipe the sleep from your eyes
And embrace the light.
You have slept now for a thousand years
Beneath starless nights.

And now it's time for you to renounce the old ways
And see a new dawn rise.

In former days
The masks were raised
When the god came down from off the mountain,
And a sacrifice was made
For they knew the day of WRATH
Was fast approaching.

Just like yesterday...
Before the war.

John Francis Dooley,
The scapegoat has run
All our sins are disowned.

And now it's time for you
To take off thy mask
And cross the Rubicon!

If you and I were one
Within the eyes of our designs,
It would still not change
The fact of our leaving.

For tonight we must leave
With the first gentle breeze.
For the Isles of Ken we are assailing!

Just like Ullyses, on an open sea
On an odyssey
Of self-discovery...",Ullyses

Like having a black sun in a white world.

I have a son,
His name is Eden.
It's his birthright,
Beyond estranged time.

Another season in this hell.
It's all sex and death as far as I can tell.

Chained to this rock of a brave new world,

Dead Can Dance,"Fortune presents gifts not according to the book
Fortune presents gifts not according to the book
When you expect whistles it's flutes
When you expect flutes it's whistles

What various paths are followed in distributing honours and possessions
She gives awards to some and penitent's cloaks to others
When you expect whistles it's flutes

Sometimes she robs the chief goatherd of his cottage and goat pen
And to whomever she fancies the lamest goat has born two kids

Dead Can Dance,"Al jorn del judici
Parrá qui haurá fet servici

Un rei vendrá perpetual
Vestit de nostra carn mortal
Del cel vindrá tot certament
Per fer del segle jutjament

Ans que el judici no será
Un gran senyal se mostrará
Lo sol perdrá lo resplendor
La terra tremirá de por

Aprés se badará molt fort
Amostrant-se de greu conhort
Mostrar-se han ab crits i trons
Les infernals confusions

Del cel gran foc davallará
Com a sofre molt pudirá
La terra cremará ab furor
La gent haurá molt gran terror

Aprés será un fort senyal
D'un terratrémol general
Les pedres per mig se rompran
I les muntanyes se fondran

Llavors ningù tindrá talent
D'or, riqueses ni argent
Esperant tots quina será
La senténcia que es dará

De morir seran tots sos talents
Esclafir-los han totes les dents
No hi haurá home que no plor
Tot lo mo'n será en tristor

Los puigs i plans seran iguals
Alli seran los bons i mals
Reis, ducs, comtes i barons
Que de llurs fets retran raons

Aprés vindrá terriblement
Lo fill de de'u omnipotent
De morts i vius judicará
Qui be' haurá fet alli es parrá

Los infants qui nats no seran
Dintre ses mares cridaran
I diran tots plorosament
""Ajuda'ns, de'u omnipotent""

Dead Can Dance,"I thought I'd found a reason to live
Just like before when I was a child
Only to find dreams made of sand
Would just fall apart and slip through my hands

But the spirit of life keeps us strong
And the spirit of life is the will to carry on

Adversity what have I done to you
To cause this reclusive silence
That has come between me and you?

And the spirit of life remains in light
And the spirit of life remains inside

I never thought it would be quite like this
Living outside of mutual bliss
But as long as the veins in our arm still stand up
The spirit of life keeps living on",Spirit
Dead Can Dance,"Outside
The storm clouds gathering,
Moved silently along the dusty boulevard.
Where flowers turning crane their fragile necks
So they can in turn
Reach up and kiss the sky.

They are driven by a strange desire
Unseen by the human eye
Someone is calling.

I remember when you held my hand
In the park we would play when the circus came to town.
Look! Over here.

Outside
The circus gathering
Moved silently along the rainswept boulevard.
The procession moved on the shouting is over

They are driven by a strange desire
Unseen by the human eye.

We sat and watched
As the moon rose again
For the very first time.

You know what came of him
To him, complexities seemed plain
He cursed the hour that gave birth to him
And saw that everything was vain
How great and wise was Solomon
The world, however, did not wait
But soon observed what followed on
It's wisdom that had brought him to this state
How fortunate the man with none

You saw courageous Caesar next
You know what he became
They deified him in his life
Then had him murdered just the same
And as they raised the fatal knife
How loud he cried ""you too my son!""
The world, however, did not wait
But soon observed what followed on
It's courage that had brought him to that state
How fortunate the man with none

You heard of honest Socrates
The man who never lied
They weren't so grateful as you'd think
Instead the rulers fixed to have him tried
And handed him the poisoned drink
How honest was the people's noble son
The world, however, did not wait
But soon observed what followed on
It's honesty that brought him to that state
How fortunate the man with none

Here you can see respectable folk
Keeping to God's own laws
So far he hasn't taken heed
You who sit safe and warm indoors
Help to relieve out bitter need
How virtuously we had begun
The world, however, did not wait
But soon observed what followed on
It's fear of God that brought us to that state

Dead Can Dance,"Farewell, now, my sister
Up ahead there lies your road
And your conscience walks beside you
It's the best friend you'll ever know

And the past is now your future
It bears witness to your soul
Make sure that the love you offer up
Does not fall on barren soil

For the wind cries of late
In the whispering grass
Our way of life is held
In the spinning wheels of chance

I believe in a way of long ago
And the sounds I believe rose our glow
And we're changing our ways

Yes, we are taking on different roads
Tell me more about the forest
That you once called home

For the wind cries of late
In the whispering leaves
And the sun will turn to waste
The heavens we build above

Father, teach your children
To treat our mother well
If we give her back her diamonds
She will offer up her pearl

We must sing her creation song
Jeune du monde
Invoke the spirits that feed us
This dreaming takes too long

But I'm not bitter, no, I'm surviving
To face the world, to raise the future
So why don't you tell me, come on and tell me
About the world you left behind
Can you tell me?

",Tell Me About the Forest (You Once Called Home)
Dead Can Dance,"I thought that you knew it all
Well you've seen it ten times before.
I thought that you had it down
With both your feet on the ground.
I love slow ... slow but deep.
Feigned affections wash over me.
Dream on my dear
And renounce temporal obligations.
Dream on my dear
It's a sleep from which you may not awaken.

You build me up then you knock me down.
You play the fool while I play the clown.
We keep time to the beat of an old slave drum.
You raise my hopes then you raise the odds
You tell me that I dream too much
Now I'm serving time in disillusionment.

I don't believe you anymore ... I don't believe you.

I thought that I knew it all
I'd seen all the signs before.
I thought that you were the one
In darkness my heart was won.

You build me up then you knock me down.
You play the fool while I play the clown.
We keep time to the beat of an old slave drum.
You raise my hopes then you raise the odds
You tell me that I dream too much
Now I'm serving time in a domestic graveyard.

I don't believe you anymore ... I don't believe you.

Never let it be said I was untrue
I never found a home inside of you.
Never let it be said I was untrue
I gave you all my time.

And we'll dance through our isolation
Seeking solace in the wisdom we bestow
Turning thoughts to the here and everafter
Consuming fears in our fiery halos

Say what you mean
Mean what you say
I've heard that innocence
Has led us all astray

But don't let them make you and break you

Locked away inside their silent screams

Dead Can Dance,"I am stretched on your grave
And will lie there forever
With your hands held in mine
I'd be sure, we'd not sever

My apple tree, my brightness
'Tis time we were together
For I smell of the earth
And am stained by the weather

When my family thinks
That I'm safe in my bed
From night until morning
I am stretched at your head

Calling out to the air
With tears both hot and wild
Oh, I grieve for the girl
That I loved as a child

The priests and the friars
Behold me in dread
Because I still love you
My love and you're dead

I would still be your shelter
From rain and from storm
And with you in your cold grave
I cannot sleep warm

Dead Can Dance,"Ever loved a woman who made you feel tall?
Ever loved a man who made you feel small?

If you were a sailor

To sail the sea

Conjures currents to break our fragile boats
And both the innocent and the damned
Are swallowed up in his wake

If you were a huntress
I'd be your bow
For your silver arrows
To seek out his heart

Ever loved a woman who made you feel tall?
Ever loved a man who made you feel small?

Who are you to complain
For lack of understanding?
We are all created equal
In just one thing alone

Alone in your thoughts that consume you through your life

Dead Can Dance,"I sat within the valley green
I sat me with my true love.
My sad heart strove the two between
The old love and the new love.
The old for her the new
That made me think on Ireland dearly.
While the soft wind blew down the glade
and shook the golden barley. 
'Twas hard the woeful words to frame
To break the ties that bound us.
But harder still to bear the shame
of foreign chains around us.
And so I said the mountain glen
I'll meet at morning early.
And I'll join the bold united men
While soft winds shook the barley. 
'Twas sad I kissed away her tears
My fond arm round her flinging.
When a foe, man's shot burst on our ears
From out the wild woods ringing.
A bullet pierced my true love's side
In life's young spring so early.
And on my breast in blood she died
While soft winds shook the barley. 
But blood for blood without remorse
I've ta'en at oulart hollow.
I've lain my true love's clay like corpse
Where I full soon must follow.
Around her grave I've wandered drear
Noon, night, and morning early.

Dead Can Dance,"The river is deep and the road is long,
daylight comes and I want to go home. 
Awoke this morning
to find my people's tongues were tied
and in my dreams
they were given books to poison their minds.
The river is deep and the mountain high,
how long before the other side. 
We are their mortar,
their building bricks and their clay.
Their gold teeth mirror
both our joys and our pain.
The river is deep and the ocean wide,
who will teach us how to read the signs. 
The earth is our mother
she taught us to embrace the light,

you plucked out my eyes,
you cut out my tongue,
you fed me with lies,

And ask him about how he likes to flirt with strangers.
He'd drop you in a second to watch the Indiana Pacers.
[Yas] Bobby, come on, you and Erica are dead wrong,
you'd have better luck hooking up with Stifler's Mom.
[Bobby] Listen, Erica's my soulmate, my fate, my world,
so get that through your head and go chase some other girl.
[Yas] Now Erica's my dream, my Billie Jean, my life.
Now is it him or is it me? You shouldn't have to think twice.

I was happy at the time,
never knowing who was mine.
Now I hear your heart is broken.
- Erica please.
I was happy at the time,
never knowing who was mine.
Now I hear your heart is broken.
[Yas] Yo, you need to - pay me a listen, and -uh- follow my vision,
and -uh- stop playing mind games and make a decision.
[Bobby] Listen up, Erica, this whole charade feels senseless.
Never knew a girl could come between friendships.
[Joss Stone]
I never meant for this to grow so far,
I'm waiting to find out who you are.
[Bobby] Erica the beautiful
[Yas] slash dangerous,
[Bobby] slash hateful, 
[Yas] slash painful,
[Bobby] she's my dark angel
[Yas] oh what a tangled web she weaves,

The harder they come, the harder they fall.
The quicker they come, the quicker they crawl.
Dead Celeb's coming back with this brand new track.
Here's another taste from our swinging battle axe.

You wanna be a star, here's a gimmick and a style,
To mimmick and free clothes to help design your image.
I feel like the only way I'll see fame and wealth,
Is to kill myself the same week my record hits the shelf.
All you really need is a record label budget,
Then watch the machine force feed it to the public.
Hate it or love it, watch it or unplug it.
Careers disappear quicker than next week's club hit.
You're just a puppet on a string I'm your master.
You're not cut out to sing, you might as well be an actor.
Or write a chapter how sex sells music,
Nobody likes your songs, they watch your videos muted.
Mixed and diluted, polluted trashed will crash.
This prostitute music selling songs with ass,
I gasp for breath, Dead Celeb pass the test.
Music for a living? I can't ask for less.

Here's another taste from our swinging battle axe.

Fuck mass appeal and fuck keeping it real,
I feel I need to date Tommy Matola for a record deal.
What would you do for that big contract?
Change your face like Michael, be on American Idol?
Act homicidal and eat your own intestines.
I thought we were musicians not Fear Factor contestants.
Overnight stars want credit? Forget it.
Yeah, you went platinum, but who bought your record?
Extra philosophy, behind a music prodigy.
The next best thing since The Motley Crue Biography.
It's like Gods become a shark in deep water.
You swim up to the mainstream, then you bite the author.
You could be a star, too, if you're near edges.
Fuck the opinions of these haters and critics.
They can be so cynic, quick to call you a gimmick.
You can't tarnish my image, you can't write it, I live it.

The harder they come, the harder they fall.
The quicker they come, the quicker they crawl.

I’ve taken what I need, shut the door when I leave
And what? What’s in store for me?
Gonna listen and not preach
It will be erased, all mistakes are out

Now I sit back and I watch, watch the sneak attack

I'm utterly at your whim all of my defenses down
Your camera looks through me with it's X-ray visions
And all systems run aground

All I can manage to push from my lips
Is a stream of absurdities
Every word I intended to speak
Winds up locked in the circuity

No way to control it, it's totally automatic
Whenever you're around
I'm walking blindfolded, completely automatic
All of my systems are down, down, down, down

What is this madness that makes my motor run
My legs too weak to stand
I go from sadness to exhilaration
Like a robot at your command

My hands perspire and shake like a leaf
Up and down goes my temperature
I summon doctors to get some relief
But they tell me there is no cure, they tell me

With flags like pubic hair ringed 'round the bottom

Could hide the oozing vibes of death

He's bringing home these weird-ass friends
Like the guy who fires blanks at his tv
When kojak's on
Or the guy who shows off his submachine gun
To his sixteen-year-old daughter's friends
Whose sense of pride and hope
Is being in the police reserve

""Don't rub 'em-they'll swell up.""

On landfill soil
To cover up a gift

How'd you like a lick
From my open sores

It's about to explode
Why evacuate

Get out the lawn chairs

And watch Martinez burn

The land we sold you
Is right atop our acid pits
We fill them by the truckload

There's thousands more toxic
Tips of the iceberg
We pay a little bribe
Or we just don't report them 

And see what you get-

No accident-
Just a little of our greed-fueled negligence

Dead Kennedys,"Punk's not dead
It just deserves to die
When it becomes another stale cartoon
A close-minded, self-centered social club
Ideas don't matter, it's who you know
If the music's gotten boring
It's because of the people
Who want everyone to sound the same
Who drive bright people out
Of our so-called scene
'Til all that's left Is just a meaningless fad
Hardcore formulas are dogshit
Change and caring are what's real
Is this a state of mind
Or just another label
The joy and hope of an alternative
Have become its own cliche
A hairstyle's not a lifestyle
Imagine Sid Vicious at 35
Who needs a scene
Scared to love and to feel
Judging everything
By loud fast rules appeal
Who played last night?
""I don't know, I forgot.
But diving off the stage Was a lot of fun.

So eager to please
Peer pressure decrees
So eager to please
Peer pressure decrees

Make the same old mistakes
Again and again,
Chickenshit conformist
Like your parents
What's ripped us apart even more than drugs
Are the thieves and the goddamn liars
Flipping people off when they share their stuff
When someone falls are there any friends?
Harder core than thou for a year or two
Then it's time to get a real job
Others stay home, it's no fun to go out
When the gigs are wrecked by gangs and thugs
When the thugs form bands, look who gets record deals
From New York metal labels looking to scam
Who sign the most racist queerbashing bands they can find
To make a buck revving kids up for war
Walk tall, act small
Only as tough as gang approval
Unity is bullshit
When it's under someone's fat boot
Where's the common cause
Too many factions
Safely sulk in their shells
Agree with us on everything
Or we won't help with anythng
That kind of attitude
Just makes a split grow wider
Guess who's laughing while the world explodes
When we're all crybabies
Who fight best among ouselves

[Chorus]
That farty old rock and roll attitude's back
""It's competition, man, we want to break big.""
Who needs friends when the money's good
That's right, the '70s are back.
Cock-rock metal's like a bad laxative
It just don't move me, ya know?
The music's OK when there's more ideas than solos
Do we rally need the attitude too?
Shedding thin skin too quickly
As a fan it disappoints me
Same old stupid sexist lyrics
Or is Satan all you can think of?
Crossover is just another word
For lack of ideas
Maybe what we need
Are more trolls under the bridge
Will the metalheads finally learn something-
Or will the punks throw away their education?
No one's ever the best
Once they believe their own press
""Maturing"" don't mean rehashing
Mistakes of the past

[Chorus]
The more things change
The more they stay the same
We can't grow
When we won't criticize ourselves
The '60s weren't all failure
It's the '70s that stunk
As the clock ticks we dig the same hole
Music scenes ain't real life
They won't get rid of the bomb
Won't eliminate rape
Or bring down the banks
Any kind of real change
Takes more time and work
Than changing channels on a TV set

Then someone asks, ""Who'd fix the sewers?""
""Would the rednecks just play king

How many liberators
Really want to be dictators
Every theory has its holes
When real life steps in
So how do we feed

All the people crowded on our earth
And transfer all that wealth
From the rich to those who need it

Well, we reject your application

Of the United States
We have a problem. 
The companies want something done about this sluggish 

World economic situation
Profits have been running a little thin lately 
And we need to stimulate some growth
Now we know 

There's an alarmingly high number of young people roaming 
Around in your country with nothing to do but stir up trouble 
For the police and damage private property. 
It doesn't look like they'll ever get a job

It's about time we did something constructive with these people
We've got thousands of 'em here too. They're crawling all over
The companies think it's time we all sit down, have a serious get-together-
And start another war

The President? 
He loves the idea! All those missiles streaming overhead to and fro
Napalm
People running down the road, skin on fire

The Soviets seem up for it:
The Kremlin's been itching for the real thing for years. 
Hell, Afghanistan's no fun
So whadya say?

We don't even have to win this war. 
We just want to cut down on some of this excess population
Now look. Just start up a draft; draft as many of those people as you can. 
We'll call up every last youngster we can get our hands on, 

Hand 'em some speed, give 'em an hour or two to learn how to use 
An automatic rifle and send 'em on their way
Libya? El Salvador? How 'bout Northern Ireland? 
Or a ""moderately repressive regime"" in South America?

We'll just cook up a good Soviet threat story 
In the Middle East-we need that oil
We had Libya all ready to go and Colonel Khadafy's hit squad 
Didn't even show up. I tell ya

That man is unreliable. 
The Kremlin had their fingers on the button just like we did for that one
Now just think for a minute-We can make this war so big-so BIG
The more people we kill in this war, the more the economy will prosper

We can get rid of practically everybody on your dole queue if we plan this right. 
Take every loafer on welfare right off our computer rolls
Now don't worry about demonstrations-just pump up your drug supply.
So many people have hooked themselves on heroin 

And amphetamines since we took over, it's just like Vietnam. 
We had everybody so busy with LSD they never got too strong. 
Kept the war functioning just fine

It's easy. 
We've got our college kids so interested in beer 
They don't even care if we start manufacturing germ bombs again. 
Put a nuclear stockpile in their back yard, 

They wouldn't even know what it looked like
So how 'bout it? Look-War is money. 
The arms manufacturers tell me unless 
We get our bomb factories up to full production 

The whole economy is going to collapse
The Soviets are in the same boat. 
We all agree the time has come for the big one, so whadya say?!?
That's excellent. We knew you'd agree

We'll play the theme from the Dinah Shore show.

Oh, his fists didn't go up so quickly this time. Yawn, yawn, yawn. 
Put those headphones on, it's be-bop time. 

I want to tell you a story about the last time I was in Portland. 
The night before we played at the Long Goodbye. 
I was walking on the street about 10:30 at night. 
A lot of people go to bed around here at 10:30 at night. 
And well, I was walking along when suddenly these jocks in this 
bright blue pickup drove up. It had KC lights, tractor tires, 
everything but the CB. It was a life-size Hot Wheels car for some dumb rich kid, 
right. Well, they drove up to me 
and they yelled what dumb rich kids usually yell, ""Hey, faggot,"" 
and showered me with some water. 
So, I stood there thinking, what a bunch of fuckheads and picked up a rock. 
Now, I waited, walked down about a block to 
where the Kentucky Fried Chicken is, on Burnside, 
and sure enough they drove around again. 
They said, ""Hey, faggot, where's the nearest McDonald's?"" I said, 
""I don't know"" and they squirted me again. 
So I threw the rock and put a nice-size dent in their giant Hot Wheels car. 
They screeched to a halt in the parking lot of some department store, 
who's name I don't remember, it's up the street from Fred Meyer, 
and they got out their clubs and they ran after me, yelling, 
""We're gonna kill you, you god damn faggot, we're gonna kill you, 
you motherfucker."" 
So I got in a phone booth by the Kentucky Fried Chicken on Burnside, 
held my legs straight out like this so they couldn't open the door 
to the phone booth. So they began charging the phone booth, 
beating on it with their club, yelling, 
""We're gonna kill you, you motherfucker, we're gonna kill you, 
you god damn faggot."" I just looked at them. 
So, there was a crowd gathering by this time 
and these kids were standing nearby and they said, 
""Oh, look at him, he's insane."" I thought, ah-hah, here's my way out. 
I yelled at them, ""Take me to a mental hospital right away. 
I want to be be put away. 
Please put me away, c'mon, call the cops and put me away. 
Please put me away now."" 
They said, ""Alright, faggot, we're calling the police."" So they called the police. 
The cop comes out and I go, ah, my savior, I'm away from these jocks. 
He opens up the door, ""Get out of there, you,"" 
throws me up against the car, frisks me, shoves me in the back. 
Then he goes over to the jocks, ""Now what happened here? 
It looks like we're going have to take him to jail 
but we got to have the full story first"" 
So the jocks, who had an ace in the hole, ace in the hole 
Take down on the bass, a little bit down on the bass. Yeah, 
ace in the hole, and they go, ""Well, goddammit, 
the motherfucker put a dent in my truck, a $5000 truck, right, 
so I got my club, I went out and I wanted to kill him. 
I want to kill him. Let me kill him, goddammit. 
Let me kill him."" 
So the cop made them go home, and he drove me home, 
and he confiscated their club and my rock as further evidence. 
And I thought, so this is Oregon, huh? Tolerant Oregon? 

Ray, are you done with your guitar yet? He isn't done yet.

And stare into your eyes
I see safety there

Is find myself a brand new lover
Somebody who lies with me
Who doesn't notice all the others

You'll be all alone
All the love that we had
I have quickly outgrown
I wanted to stay
But I just couldn't do it
Couldn't stand there
And put you through it

My other loves will tell you
That I'm nothing but a pleasure seeker
And for once I really must agree
I need to leave you by yourself
And go in search of someone else
To satisfy my curiosity

Dead Prez,"Help me
You want me to help you?
Man is evil, capable of nothing but destruction

Once upon a time
There was a very serious situation growing
There was a farmer and a farmyard filled with animals
And this is the story of their times

Old man Sammy had a farm
Walked the land with the rifle
Most of the time shit was calm
His whole life was maintained off the everyday labor

From the mules in the field to the cattle in the stable
This is how we kept food on this table
(Maxing)
You would have he was disabled by the way he be relaxing
Acting like Mr. Magnificent

But the animals were thinking something different
The sentiment was tension in the barnyard
Throughout the years they had been through mad drama
With the farmer, word is bond

And they all came to one conclusion
They argued there was no way they'd ever be free
If it was up to humans
Therefore the only course left was revolution
Which was understandable

And since the pigs promised to lead in the interest of all the animals
They planned a full attack under the leadership of Hannibal
The fattest pig in the pack
The next morning on the farm, everything was calm

Just before dawn but before long
The sun got so hot it made the farm seem electric
Now check it this is when that shit got hectic
Directed by Hannibal, the animals attacked

Old Sam was in a state of shock and fell up on his back
And dropped his rifle reaching in vain
Each and every creature from the field at his throat
Screaming, ""Kill, feel the pain""

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

After they ran the farmer off the farm
The pigs went around and called a meeting in the barn
Hannibal spoke for several hours
But when talks about his plans for power

That's when the conversation turned sour
He issued an official ordinance to set
If not a pig from this day forth then you insubordinate
That's when the horses went buck wild

One of them shouted out
""You fraudulent pigs, we know your fucking style""
Hannibal's face was flushed and pale
All the animals eyes full of disgust and betrayal

He felt the same way Sam felt
They took his tongue out of his mouth
And cut his body up for sale, for real
You better listen while you can

It's a very thin line between animal and man
When Hannibal crossed the line they all took a stand
What would have done? Shook his hand?
This is the animal in man

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

This play is gonna show how the pigs react when the people start
To take community, control over what belongs to them
And liberate it back (echoes)

Sometimes I just don't care

Murderation, modern hanging education
Price of your life is goin' up it ain't inflation
Incrimination, they got my picture at the station
Elimination, state to state we eatin' by this nation
Them belly full, my trigger finger got pulled
To cut the bull shots'll warm your flesh like wool
These tools for survival make fools out of rivals
Fuck the Bible, get on your knees and praise my rifle
Your life is done there ain't another place to run
Eat your own gun, scared because my people never known fun

Cops drive down the streets and blow my friends away
I try to smoke enough lah to take my sins away
This E and J be freein' us in it's own special way son
We live for the day, the only way done
The violence in me, reflect the violence that surround me
I choose that wildly Mr. Charley keep his eye on me
To figure my head, but them ass kissin' niggas is dead
We learn the choke holds with fishermen's thread
I read The Art of Sun-Tzu in a couple of fuckin' days
Used to practice Kung-Fu with this nigga that's like, double my age
And you can put this on the government's grave
Somebody payin' for the way we have to suffer and slave
Assassination, word up

I hope they get the assassins, I hope that something is done to them
Problem is they're killing them, it reminds me of something like what
Happened to Lincoln

You ain't even safe wit a full clip
Hustle out on the president's grave
I'm sick of livin' in this bullshit
We down to take it to the full length
Meet us up on Capitol Hill, and we can get up in some real shit

So many pretty things to please ya

Beautiful birds, natural scenery

And good food put me in the mood for a festival
Some say the summer make a woman more sexual (s'up, boo)
It's instinct -- that's why my game be right on schedule
I put the great Mother Nature on a pedestal
She always fly, but today, she's exceptional
If I had a chance to make a wish
Every day would be just like this, full of Happiness

Sometime, I feel the same way, roll up a j, and get away
Put some food on the grill
And just chill
Maybe build with my elders (uh)
Never know the things they could tell ya
Learnin' why the caged bird sings (why it do that?)
'Cuz it's the vital things you know that separate the men from the Kings
The flowers that bloom and the Sun (uh)
And everybody singin' the tune, 'cuz it's time to have fun
We out, rollerbladin' (uh, uh), a day where no one coulda stayed inside
Wash the car, now it's time to take a ride

Celebration of life, 'cuz every day is a surprise

What you doin tonight? you should stop by the site
We could, roll some weed play some records and talk
I got a fly spot downtown Brooklyn, New York
Now I know you think I want to fuck, no doubt
but tonight we'll try a different route, how bout we start
With a salad, a fresh bed of lettuce with croutons
Later we can play a game of chess on the futon
See i ain't got to get in your blouse
It's your eye contact, that be getting me aroused
When you show me your mind, it make me want to show you mines
Reflecting my light, when it shines, just takin our time
Before the night's through, we could get physical too
I ain't tryin to say I don't want to fuck, cause I do
But for me boo, makin love is just as much mental
I like to know what I'm gettin into

We could have mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation

It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation
Time for some mind sex...

Before we make love

Yeah, what you know about mind sex?

Before we make love

African princess, tell me yo' interests
Wait, let me guess boo, you probably like poetry
Here's a little something I jotted down in case I spotted you around
So let me take this opportunity
Would you share a moment with me, over herbal tea?
Take a walk verbally, make a bond certaintly
'cause in my hand I bet your hand fit perfectly
And it's like we floatin out in space when you flirtin wit me
c'mon, a little foreplay don't hurt (hmmm)
Imagine my chest under this shirt, your ass under your skirt
It's like walking the hot sands and finding an oasis
Opposites attract that's the basis
Our sex is the wind that separates the yin from the yang
The balance that means complete change, our aim
Is to touch you in a delicate spot
And once we get it started I ain't trying to stop

But first we have mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation

It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations

You couldn't neva understand how my mind tick
I'm on some old school crime shit
When niggas sold two's to keep the dimes lit
Ain't no rules when these iron shots are stoned dun
This heat burn through your flesh, stright to the bones
I reach for the buddha cess and zone
I probably have a future of stress, stay depressed and be alone
But as far as the present time its on
I represent mine til I return to the S and said I'm dead and gone
Nobody want to be broke and you neither
Put me on the co'na, watch me catch a quick case of cream fever
If you be poppin shit my niggas won't believe ya
Probably punch you in the face and take ya wallet when we see ya
But son it gets deeper 
I'm runnin with a click that's bein' hunted by the grim reaper
To all my peoples in the man keeper 
Let'cha situation be a teacher
Ain't nothin like a education 
When I was locked down I learned about patience and dedication
And not to say shit, unless you need a motherfuckin face lift
And as a youth I was a outcast
Runnin around with ?pelagons? playin war but now it's all about cash

Chorus:

I'm caught up, caught up in a mix of shit
And I ain't tryin to hear shit til my got cash to get
Blast you with the pistol
If I have to, in my mind its all about cash in a fistfull
I'm caught up in a mix of shit
And I ain't tryin to hear shit til my got cash to get
Splash you with the pistol
If I have to, in my mind its all about cash in a fistfull

Up late night and upset, and fed up
Niggas comin up wet, I'm dead up
Fuck tryin to your head up
And when it go down, word bond we gotta get up
Too many locked down upstate, son its a set up
My life has sped up, many years I'm straight up
Plenty bears for who ain't here and those who ate up
Test and get sprayed up in the club
We couldn't run it so we take the blade up in the booth
Since we couldn't shoot
We heat it up, losin the shirt, showin the bare chest
I'm blessed, puffin the skunk make me care less
The best that you can do is duck my fuckin crew
If the slugs don't get'cha, lord J'll jig ya
Actin artificial you'll get burnt my the pistol
Before its done, even my guns'll turn to missles
Don't have to blow the whistle on you
'cause everybody knows you
Watch yourself around borderline pyschos
Who know my people gotta hold a mint
Or they ain't worth a cent
How can you represent, if you can't pay the rent
And leave a dent in my life time, I'm caught up in trife crime
In fights you neva know what you might find
We stand firm meanwhile 'cause niggas that seem wild
Be buckin blanks, if they were men they wouldn't fuck with pranks
I leave them niggas alone and stay home
Unitl it cool down as they remember how my tool sound

Forever keeping my shit cocked for drama
Stainless steal, shit is for real
The way these rats is known to squeal, makin' sour deals
Thugs up in to mix with these drugs, caught up in the humble
Bricks and paper by the bundle how the Bronx humble
??? devils get deaded, never regret it, only known to set it
Stealin existence obviuosly ya jetted
Speak the desest, I see the pyramid and eagle
Back of the dollar bill, ill decitful, we consider leathal
God fallin, niggas be ballin, guzzlin alcoholics
Two drinks, too many is like whitey infulltrating your fortress
This is on, we 'bout to form, best prepare for the storm
Ya'll funny niggas quick to ring the alarm

Dead Prez,"You have the emergence in human society 
Of this thing that's called the State
What is the State?  The State is this organized bureaucracy
It is the police department.  It is the Army, the Navy
It is the prison system, the courts, and what have you
This is the State it is a repressive organization
But the state and gee, well, you know, 
You've got to have the police, cause.. 
If there were no police, look at what you'd be doing to yourselves!
You'd be killing each other if there were no police!  
But the reality is
The police become necessary in human society 
Only at that junction in human society 
Where it is split between those who have and those who ain't got

I throw a Molotov cocktail at the precinct, you know how we think
Organize the hood under I Ching banners
Red, Black and Green instead of gang bandanas
F.B.I. spyin' on us through the radio antennas
And them hidden cameras in the streetlight watchin' society
With no respect for the people's right to privacy
I'll take a slug for the cause like Huey P.
While all you fake niggaz try to copy Master P
I want to be free to live, able to have what I need to live
Bring the power back to the street, where the people live
We sick of workin' for crumbs and fillin' up the prisons
Dyin' over money and relyin' on religion for help
We do for self like ants in a colony
Organize the wealth into a socialist economy
A way of life based off the common need
And all my comrades is ready, we just spreadin' the seed

[Chorus]
The average Black male
Live a third of his life in a jail cell
Cause the world is controlled by the white male
And the people don't never get justice
And the women don't never get respected
And the problems don't never get solved
And the jobs don't never pay enough
So the rent always be late; can you relate?
We livin in a police state

No more bondage, no more political monsters
No more secret space launchers
Government departments started it in the projects
Material objects, thousands up in the closets
Could've been invested in a future for my comrades
Battle contacts, primitive weapons out in combat
Many never come back
Pretty niggaz be runnin' with gats
Rather get shot in they back than fire back
We tired of that - corporations hirin' blacks
Denyin' the facts, exploitin' us all over the map
That's why I write the shit I write in my raps
It's documented, I meant it
Every day of the week, I live in it; breathin' it
It's more than just fuckin believin' it
I'm holdin' them ones, rollin' up my sleeves an' shit
It's cee-lo for push-ups now, many headed for one conclusion
Niggaz ain't ready for revolution

Verse 1:
You can't fool all the people all of the time
But if you fool the right ones, then the rest will fall behind
Tell me who's got control of your mind? your world view?
Is it the news or the movie you're taking your girl to? (uh)
Know what i'm sayin cause Uncle Sam got a plan 
If you examine what they tellin us then you will understand
What they plantin in the seeds of the next generation
Feeding our children miseducation 
No one knows if there's UFO's or any life on mars
Or what they do when they up in the stars
Because i don't believe a word of what the president said
He filling our head with lies got us hypnotised
When he be speaking in cold words about crime and poverty
Drugs, welfare, prisons, guns and robbery
It really means us, there's no excuse for the slander
But what's good for the goose, is still good for the gander

Verse 2:
I don't want no computer chip in my arm
I don't want to die by a nuclear bomb
I say we all rush the pentagon, pull out guns 
And grab the intercom, my first word's will be I believe
Man made God, outta ignorance and fear
If God made man, then why the hell would he put us here?
I thought he's supposed to be the all loving
The same God who let Hitler put the Jews in the oven
We don't fall for the regular shit, they try to feed us 
All this half-ass leadership, flippin position 
They turn politcian and shut the hell up and follow tradition
For your TV screen, is telling lies to your vision
Every channel got some brainwashed cop shit to watch
Running up in niggas cribs claiming that they heard shots
It's a plot, but busta can you tell me who's greedier?
Big corporations, the pigs or the media?
Sign of the times, terrorism on the rise
Commercial airplanes, falling out the sky like flies
Make me wonder what secrets went down with Bob Brown (?)
Who burnt churches to the ground with no evidence found?
It's not coincidence, it's been too many studied incidents
It coulda been the Klan who put that bomb at the Olympics
But it probably was the FBI, deep at the call
'cause if they make us all panic then they can start martial law

I don't believe Bob Marley died from cancer

My mama died and my father got drunk
They left me, to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road
I grew up in a rusty shack
All i owned was hangin on my back
And Lord knows, how I learnt
This place called Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road, you're dirty and you're filthy
Tobacco Road, gonna get me some dynamite and a crane
I'm gonna blow it up, Lord knows gonna start all over again""

Fuck what you heard, I'm from Africa
This ain't no act it's mathematical
Past the black radical
I choose the M1, because it's practical
Nothin was changed, we ain't protected
No names, it's all factual
They push the wrong buttons, count down to detonate
Brooklyn blown away and the world will have to speculate
This is what we learn in the streets, fuck a degree
Believe in none of what you hear and half of what you see

[Stic]
It's like watching your own father smoke crack
I have nightmares on shit like that
No way in hell I'll ever get like that
I seen a lot of shit in twenty-two years
It's like a tour of duty
My life is booby-trapped, it's hard to see the beauty
When your heart is turning ice cold
Cold like your hands exposed to blistering winds
My mother keep her eyes closed, she say she prayin
I listen close to what she sayin 
When she speak of Jesus I ignore it
But when it's practical I'm all for it
You got to think like a soldier
I'm training myself to snatch pistols out of holsters
Discipline keep the mind focused
This whole world is a corn field son
Look out for flying locusts

Chorus (x2)

Don't let 'em get in your head, they try to probe you
Figure your thoughts so they can try and control you
And through you, control your whole crew
It's psychology boy, now what the fuck that make you want to do?

[M1]
You can't walk the streets with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
And if you know the time, give me a sign
Tell me where we draw the line
I got your back if you got mine
My enemy's enemy is my man
One dreadlock is stronger than one strand while the crackers got the upper hand
My comrades stand on lands stolen
Every tooth a golden opportunity
Who holdin my community hostage?
10% ransom, costing us time we lost and some
This is how the plan runs
Thinkin with a fugitive brain
What we do to live is insane
Holdin the weed, healing my membranes
Just like crack, you know it all boils down 
to the dollars-and-cents of it
Niggaz commence to get ? to sentenced to serve terms
Jumping the fence, the black germ is loose
When will they learn?

[Stic]
We piss on walls and smoke reefa in the halls
No respect for their laws
I cut your face with a kitchen knife
In gladiator times, man against machinery
The tree bark fatigues help me blend in with the scenery boy
Life is a series of serious choices
Theories is formed from experience, never mysterious forces
Various courses of life can lead to failure
Too much of anything is a trap
My mind snap
Guerilla warfare for two grand
They say karate means 'empty hands'
So then it's perfect for the poor man...
They say karate means 'empty hands'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
Imagine havin no runnin water to drink
Chemicals contaminate the pipes leadin to your sink
Just think, if the grocery stores close they doors
And they saturate the streets with tanks and start martial law
Would you be ready for civil war
Could you take the life of somebody you know, 
or have feelings for if necessary?
I got cousins in the military
But far as I'm concerned they died, when they registered

[Verse 2]
Yo, this world is oh so cold, I think about my ancestors
Being sold, and it make me want to break the mold
Fuck the gold and the party, train yourself, clean your shottie
Tell me what you gon do to get free, we need more than MC's
We need Hueys, and revolutionaries
The niggas on the streets today, it's kinda scary
The smell around my way ain't roses or strawberries
In fact it's kinda poisonous, bringin out the boy in us
But I'ma stand up on my own, like a man do
Dominate the land and make wealth, like Fu-Manchu
Yes the peoples army stick togehther like glue

Just one gun is all it take to get it started

HOOK 2X:
If you don't think it could happen think again my son
Be prepared for the worst that's yet to come
We want freedom, prophecies and ancient wisdom
Cataclsym, niggas be like fuck the system

I don't want to be no movie star
I don't want to drive no fancy car
I just want to be free, to live my life, to live my own life

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm for peace
But I'll kill ya if ya fuck with my moms or my niece
See we all want peace, but the problem is
Crackers want a bigger piece
Got it where the niggas can't get a piece
That's why police get stabbed and shot
'cause a nigga can't eat if the ave is hot
Locked up you get three hot meals and one cot
Then you sit and rot, never even got a fair shot
That's where a whole lotta niggas end up
My man moms even got sent up, tryin to keep the rent up
When I'm bent up I think a lot about the reason I'm here
I think about the things I fear in the comin years
Ahead of me, I'm ready for whatever they bring though
I'd go against a tank wit a shank for my dreams
And that's my fuckin word
One day the whole world will smoke herb
And niggas won't get took to jail for hangin on the curb

HOOK 2X

(next part of hook)

HOOK",We Want Freedom
Dead Prez,"I'm not a hunter but I am told,
That, uh, in places like in the arctic,
Where indiginous people sometimes might, might, hunt a wolf,
They'll take a double edged blade,

And they'll put blood on the blade,
And they'll melt the ice and stick the handle in the ice,
So that only the blade is protruding,
And that a wolf will smell the blood and wants to eat,

And it will come and lick the blade trying to eat,
And what happens is when the wolf licks the blade,
Of course, he cuts his tongue, and he bleeds,
And he thinks he's really having a good thing,

And he drinks and he licks and he licks,
And of course he is drinking his own blood and he kills himself,
That's what the Imperialists did with us with crack cocaine,
You have these young brothers out there who think they are getting something

They gonna make a living with,
They is getting something they can buy a car,
Like the white people have cars, why can't I have a car?
They getting something they can get a piece of gold,

White people have gold, why can't I have gold?
They getting something to get a house,
White people have a house, why can't I have a house?
And they actually think that there's something that's bringing resources to them,

But they're killing themsleves just like the wolf was licking the blade,
And they're slowly dying without knowing it.
That's what's happening to the community, you with me on that?
That's exactly, precisely what happens to the community,

And instead of blaming the hunter who put the damn handle and blade in the ice
For the wolf,
That what happens is the wolf gets the blame, gets the blame for trying to live,
That's what happens in our community,

You don't blame the person, the victim,
You blame the oppressor, Imperialism, white power is the enemy,
Was the enemy when it first came to Africa,
And snatched up the first African brothers here against our will,

Isss the enemy today,

Dead Prez,"Now there's two things that's the same
In every hood, in every ghetto across the world
And that's struggle, and that's dreams

In my hood, Southside Tallahassee, FL
I had both of those, still got both of those
I?ma let you in on somethin? real quick

Let's take it back to the early ?90s
Taleho, Florida is where you'll find me
'78 Omega automobile I'm driving
Bass bamblin? with the wind behind me

Hitch from the attic is the name of the crew
?Coz road shows and hoes that's all we do
And all three P's believe me, we got that hot shit
To the point that nigga 'bout to quit on college

Parents upset ?coz I shat on school
Beat spot got hot so I'm playin' it cool
Crew movin' to New York, I'm 22 years old
My girl's stayin' ?coz she's scared of the cold

Out in the world
(Where you tryin' to make it at)
Out in the world
(Where they tryin' to take it at)

Out in the world
(Where my folk tryin' to get fat)
Out in the world
(And every time get set back)

Out in the world
(Where my dawgs at?)
Out in the world
(Uh huh, fo? sho)

(Where my folk gonna stay strong)
Out in the world
(Niggas move on)

Now I'm in the Brook, how I indicate her
Whole different look, different sound and flavor
Washin? dishes at the Hotel Four Seasons
15 an hour, don't plan on leavin'

Homesick, skippin' work every weekend
Went down, found out my girl was cheatin'
Heart broke, tired, started freakin'
Year later terminated for no reason

Got a new girl as the leaves turn brown
Seein' me stressed said she would hold me down
Had to move to the Bronx where the crooks be juxin?
Sold my first track, moved back to Brooklyn

Music 101, the whole game is dirty
Got me 25, feelin' all of 30
Went from a lover to straight up hustler
Stressed a lot, developed clusters

Out in the world
(Where you tryin' to make it at)
Out in the world
(Where they tryin' to take it at)

Out in the world
(Where my folk tryin' to get fat)

(Where my folk gonna stay strong)
Out in the world
(Niggas move on)

2 G, Y2K bug is gone
Put my gas mask back 'coz them lights is on
Dead Prez in the stores and the streets is groovin'
Hi, I'm still broke and my beats is movin'

Gotta grind harder 'coz my bills is major
Got a cell phone, had to dead the pager
Can't blame the game 'coz the game don't feed you
Can't blame the world 'coz the world don't need you

Seem like every excuse I use is see-through
Help myself first, then help my people
'Coz folks sells hope, runnin' scams to burn me
Wash me, comb me, relax and perm me

Gotta get control and stop this car from swerving
Now I'm kinda cold, only the doe concerns me
Try to spend less than the amount I'm earnin'
Lessons everyday I'm learnin'

Out in the world
(Where you tryin' to make it at)
Out in the world
(Where they tryin' to take it at)

Out in the world

Nigga got 2 or 3 dollars to my name
And my homies in the same boat goin' through the same thing

Ready for a cake, better plot for the paper

We gonna order take out and when we see the driver
We gonna stick the 25 up in his face

Let's ride, steppin' outside like warriors
Head to the notorious Southside
One weapon to the four of us
Hidin' in the corridor until we see the beam from car headlights

White boy in' the wrong place at the right time
Soon as the car door open up he mine
We roll up quick and put the pistol to his nose
By the look on his face he probably shitted in his clothes

You know what this is, it's a stick up
Gimme the do' from your pickups
You ran into the wrong niggaz
We runnin' down the block hot with these stacks of boxes

Even got the boys in the crew a few things
Po po never know who to true blame

Sto' after sto' you know we kept rollin'
Wait two weeks, report the car stolen
Repeat the cycle like a like a laundry mat
Like a glitch in the system it's hard to catch

Comin' out the mall with the shoppin' bags
We can take it right back then get the cash
Yeah, get a friend and then do it again
Damn right, that's how we paid the rent

I made her feel like it was an emergency
When I came to the crib niggaz couldn't believe
I came back with a big bag of groceries, hell yeah

Every job I ever had I had to get on the first day
I find out how to pimp on the system
Two steps ahead of the manager
Gettin' over on the regular tax free money out of the register

And when I'm workin' late nights
Stockin' boxes I'm creepin' they merchandise
And don't put me on dishes I'm droppin' them bitches
And takin' all day long to mop the kitchen shit

We ain't gettin' paid commission, minimum wage
Modern day slave conditions
Got me flippin' burgers with no power
Can't even buy one off what I make in an hour

I'm not the one to kiss ass for the top position
I take mine off the top like a politician
Where I'm from doin' dirt is a part of living
I got mouths to feed, dawg, I gots to get it

So much shit goes on it makes me doubt about a God -- you know, makes me ask
well if there is a God then why am I in the situation that I'm in?
Or why is my family going through certain situations
when I don't think that they deserve it nah mean?
Or why do good people suffer so much and bad people prosper so much?

I been working all my life but ain't got nothin' to show

What a nigga gonna eat when the refrigerator empty?
Work all week let the bossman pimp me?
Can't pay no rent till the 15th
Landlord call the police to evict me
Lookin for a job in the want ads
Have you ever been to jail? Know they gone ask
Ever took a piss test that you didn't pass?
In between jobs in the past? How you get cash?
I done worked over hot ass stoves
I done picked up trash off roads
Winter time in the streets and the cold
Many times had to sleep in my clothes on the flo'
What you know bout bein' po' seein' most of yo kinfolk be on dope?
Ain't nobody in the hood got no hope in this fucked up system and that's why we don't vote
Still payin niggaz 4.25 - How the fuck we supposed to survive?
I'm close to the edge, government takin most of my bread
in taxes might as well have this close to my head

You can work to the bone but don't put all yo eggs in one basket
We don't never get a piece of the pie
Work 50 years, retire then die
Stay po', rich folks is the criminal
but you don't want to hear me tho' so
thank God it's friday, ain't it what we live fo'?
Nigga gotta get up out the plantation
Same job that my pop had before me
Imma pass it down to my seed fucked up situation

(Verse 1)
What you know about the running, the stretching
The cars, the weapons
The path, the journey
The jewels, the learning
The fear, the focus
The aches, the pains
The contact sparrin', the breaks, the sprains
The trial and error, the ranks, and belts
The spiritual growth, the science of breath
The tests, the techniques
The forms, the stances
The flow, the rhythm, the internal answers
The herbs, the healing, the quiet meditation
The truths reveal through daily dedication
The love for the art, the sweat on your shirt
The mind, the body, and the spirit that work
The feelings of failure, the hope to succeed
The battles of questions like ""Should I smoke weed?""

(Verse 2)
The water, the thirst
The cleansing, the blessings
The flash of insights, the teachings, the lessons
The grappling and locking, trapping and boxing
The training and slacking
The starting and stopping
And stayin' committed, when your homies ain't with it
The hours or practice after the class is finished
The cause of your ignorance, flaws in your discipline
Broken laws of nutrition, and pork and dishin'
The vitamins and supplements
Salads and ointments

The kingships, pull joints in doctor appointments
The dues, the pads, the wraps, the gloves
The mouthpiece you left home, the taste of your own blood
The hunger, the blocks
The punches, the squats
The crunches, the example you set for the youngsters
The will, the skills, the kill or the hill
The separation between what's fake and what's real
The laws of physics, The class ""comradery""
The vows of humility, the bow, the courtesy.

Who he gonna open up the door for?
I don't wanna to discourage my folk
I believe in hope
I just want us to want more

How they keep us contained
There gotta be more that we could hope for
Democrats and Republicans
Just 2 sides of the same coin
Either way, it's still white power

Go ahead and vote for the lesser of two evils

",Death & Rebirth
Dead to Fall,"They met in the dark of the night
For a final time, for the great showdown
Two dreamers deciding which path to take
One for their future, one for the present

I was standing strong until you showed your face
To ruin and ravage everything we've planned
Your dream is empty with its promise, your self fulfillment
The future holds so much more for us

One of us will die before this is over
One of us will die before this is over

The sword of vengeance glistens in the moonlight
Her words fall silent as he makes his attack
Now we will find out who truly holds the power
I'm waiting for you to relinquish your hold
There is no room for us so you must be destroyed
Then I'm afraid this is unavoidable

His blade plunges deep cutting down to the core
And with her last gasp for breath
All her dreams and aspirations fade
She pleads for him to see, to see, for him to see the truth

And with one final slice she's gone forever
No more dreams, no more tears, she's gone
And with one final slice she's gone forever
No more dreams, no more tears, she's gone

Bleed for nothing now, for no one hears your cries
Bleed for nothing now, for no one hears your cries
Bleed for nothing now, for no one hears your cries

He stands there victorious and alone
Suffering through what he himself has made
Without her, there is no point to my fight
He sees it all as it slowly begins to fade

One of us will die before this is over
One of us will die before this is over

He realizes now without her
Life loses point
Without the battle, without their struggle
Life loses point

He has no purpose now
Life loses point
As everything fades, everything fades
Life loses point

Not a kind of face among them

And I probably do
The blade smiles at me
For it knows the truth

Take my place on the throne of
Martyrs and sinners

Take my place on the throne of
Martyrs and sinners

It's falling, falling and slicing through
Removing me from myself
For the final time I see now
That I deserve much, much worse

And I must be severed

And I must be severed

Nothing for me
But their cold hard gaze
My heart welcomes
Death's warm embrace

Take my place on the throne of
Martyrs and sinners

Take my place on the throne of
Martyrs and sinners

Give me no last words
Give me no last meal
Just give me sweet, sweet death
Make my worst fears real

I've done all I can
This is out of my hands
Don't ask me to forgive
And I won't ask to live

No more steps
And no more time
The blade, it falls
And ends this life

As the faces fade
And life, it flashes by
Fills with lies and hate
My demise has arrived

Falling downward in time
These walls speak of my hell
His vengeful eyes say to me
""My son, you have served me well""

And I must be severed

The blood of your victims shall drip from the skies like rain and may the sun fall into oceans of blood... death and darkness shall reign for ten thousands
Of generations...your children will be drenched in blood... Because he who kills cannot love and he who loves would never kill....
There is no forgiveness and no mercy when mankind forgets its duties to creation and when my last words are spoken your families shall be cursed....

With yours... and your children shall pay for the sins of their fathers...ten thousand generations in blood.... ... ... he died and his words like thounderous blows
Rang and rolled over the earth... like a breath, like a wind, like a shadow, a phantom... and on the darkened sky crows will appear to bring back the light

Connor said ""Don't worry, I'm scared to death myself
When I look into his eyes I see a demon straight from hell!
Coming straight for me - coming for the kill""
That's when the shots were fired
BANG
And it was done

All were looking for an angel when the pale rider, he comes
Looking for an angel an the pale rider he comes . . .

Deadman,"Oh, holy night
Oh holy, holy day
Oh carry me, carry me away
When we first went down
Juarez was a different town
""Gracias"" was all I could say.

Rosa Marie tonight
Blessed Marie tonight

You're not looking for love,
Just an escape she said
But the boot is on the other foot this time
And we, we can be friends
We can make amends
If your prayers to Mary are heard

Rosa Marie, tonight
Blessed Marie, tonight

I'm not looking for an escape or a holy grail
I'm not looking for an easy way out
I'm just looking for the ""Cross of Santa Fe""

",Rosa Marie
Deadman,"We take no prisoners, when it rains it pours
Give me time, give me sweet by and by
And I know we can make it through it.
When they say that it's not true when I say that I love you,
It's alright - I'll be standing by your side
When they say that it's not so, he won't be with you when
You grow old, it's alright - I'm hear to prove 'em wrong.

Chorus
So give 'em time and they'll come around
You gotta stay alive when the sun goes down
To see the glory of a city open wide
Cause tonight darling, you will be my bride.

Well the people up in Detroit - they get their soul from Marvin Gaye
And the people down in California, get their sunshine in L.A.
From the bluegrass to the blues, Elvis Presley's ""Blue Suede Shows""
Singing sweet Mississippi ghost crooning slide guitar
Down in Texas, it's alright with it's hot tequila nights
Selling romance of riding into Mexico.

Chorus

Well the preachers down in Greenwood, they stomp the Gospel out on hardwood floors
And the gamblers lost in Vegas, don't believe it anymore
Well they're trying just to behave hearing Robert Johnson from the grave
Running scared with the hell-hounds still on his trail
And Jacob in the field - to the angel's strength he yields
You feel the spirit moving and its hard to fail.

Chorus
",Sun Go Down
Deadman,"
Three murders . . .
Three murders' what the headlines say
They contradict the blackened day
And there's nothing that can stop it they say.
Three victims
Three victims laid to rest
The cops all protest, the claim to have done their best

That there's nothing more they can do, nothing more they can do

Juarez,
Juarez is a haunted place
The ambulances try and race
To beat the other's to the place where
Three women
all working for the mighty peso, can't seem to let it go
and the numbers still climb and grow

And there's nothing more they can do, nothing more they can do

How long is to long and you've had enough?
How little is too late to stop it and the hate goes on and on.

And I hope you see the light of day
I hope you see the light of day. . .
",Three Murders
Deadman,"I see violence coming around the bend
Violence is coming around the bend
I see violence burning bright - cuts through the murky night
And the water is washing over me

I walk through the shadow of death
I walk through the shadow of death
When a burning light cut's through the dreary night
And the water is washing over me

The soldier pierced Jesus in his side
The soldier pierced Jesus in his side
pierced Him with his sword - out holy water poured
And the water is washing over me.
",The Water Is Washing Over Me
Deadman,"They used to tell me I was building a dream
And so I followed the mob
When their was earth to plow or guns to bear
I was always their right on the job

They used to tell me I was building a dream
With peace and glory ahead
Why should I be standing in line
Just waiting for bread?

Once I built a railroad, I made it run
Made it race against time
Once I built a railroad, now it's done
Brother, can you spare a dime?

Once I built a tower up to the sun
Brick and rivet and lime
Once I built a tower, now it's done
Brother, can you spare a dime?

Once in khaki suits, gee we looked swell
Full of that Yankee-Doodly-dum
Half a million boots went sloggin' through Hell
And I was the kid with the drum

Say, don't you remember, they called me ""Al""
It was ""Al"" all the time
Why don't you remember, I'm your pal
Say buddy, can you spare a dime?

Raise your weapon, raise your weapon

Ripping my heart was so easy, so easy
Launch your assault now, take it easy
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon

Ripping through like a missile, ripping through my heart
Rob me of this love
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon

Always number one, the pen with a bent wrist, crooked king

How does it feel now, to watch it burn, burn, burn

Deadmau5,"Don't wake me up, I'm winning wars inside my head
And maybe I'm weak but not beneath the covers of this bed
Asleep, I'm undefeated in this world of mine
So let me stay inside this dream and keep me from the light
I've built this place behind my eyes you'll never see
And you can move my body but please keep my mind asleep
Beyond the galaxies where there's no space or time
I will transform, I am reborn to rule over the skies

I
I feel it in my bones
Escape the world unknown
It's under my control
I
I just wanna see this way
Blood pumping in my veins
I feel it, I feel it

Behind the darkness there's a sea of neon light
And maybe you think I'm sinking, but you just can't get inside
Don't try to save me when my mind is finally free
'Cause I'd rather run my own world than face your reality
It's not enough for me to paint with black and white
Inside my head there are shades of red unknown to waking life
You think you travel far and never seen the stars
'Cause the only the way is if I say you can follow me that far

And then you regret every single word you said
You will wish to make things undone in the end
You feel sorry
But that won't help
No that won't help

Feel that anger in your mind
Have you been right or wrong?
From the bottom of your heart you must confess

Leave words unspoken
Sometimes it's better to keep things rolling
Hide em somewhere
In a place where no one hears em

Catch em, hide em, swallow them, get rid of em
Get used to that, get used to that

Before you spit words out and you regret every single one you lose
Always remember the meaning cannot be turned
You will try to make things undone but this chance does not exist
You must confess, you better

Leave words unspoken
Sometimes it's better to keep things rolling
Hide em somewhere
In a place where no one hears em
Leave words unspoken

If you will ever change your mind
You would regret that you didn't

Leave words unspoken
Keep words in the shadow of your mind
Bind them to your heart and take em to the grave

Trek through all of the feelings with no tears in eyes 
Kept fear veiled so it hides

So there's nothing inside me I just seem alive

And twist it till your face turns cherry red

Deadsy,"How the story rolls
Magic's taught and history's told
A glory hole
Which through gazed her eyes of gold
Those veins run cold
Mystery's wife evades her soul
Scaring to and fro 

Tearing through the snow
As she makes her darling coat
Hoarding all the shawls
Now her evil highness rose 

Kind of like Shakespearean prose
Without the rose
Avid as she sows
Cruella grows
Horace and Jasper stole
So let the horror flow 

Black and white in hair
Elegantly gaunt in frame
A boney flare
Which christened Cruel with creepy grace
Always smokey air
Circling one lurch, Hepburn face
In her head which filled the space
Was the one hellacious taste
As she aims her fate
Nothing flees her sore embrace 

As the biggest mistake that Cruel ever made
Was when she left her cave and started to reign
As the love for her fades
Our feelings won't change
So my darling Cruella
We see through the grey 

In her cold glare
Loveliest and rare
Frightened you'll soon wear
And this elegantly haunting is so fair
There's no reason to part from her cold lair
She has all of the loveliest and rare 
Things which frighten at first
But she'll soon wear 

She's a regional spark from this nowhere
And this elegant loveliness so fair
Taking strolls through the dark by the moon's glare
As she listens for barks in the night air
Always searching for marks on the white hair 

Cruel, you're so fair

Deadsy,"I got the key, key to Gramercy Park

Every night
Looking for the fight
Thoughts on the left
The action's on the right
As you know, the id wasn't meant to be starved

Face white
Revenge of the Hittites
When you're inside
And you thought to take a walk in the park
Think someone is about to be carved

From the other side of the Underscene
To the boulevard of broken dreams
To find the key to Gramercy Park

I got the key, key to Gramercy Park
Where it's safe to be afraid of the dark
Maybe there we'll fuck by the heavenly stars
But I might, might miss breaking in through the bars

From the other side of the Underscene
To the boulevard of broken dreams
To find the key to Gramercy Park
In the other time of mother speed
Through evil eyes and make believe
To where we bare the supremacy mark

And never look at the other place
Stay with what's pristine that touches you
Where the peril accentuates
Something that could mean so much to you
Try save a seat in the golden cage
The media mass has still yet to say
To simply pass or rise from the grave

Now I've got the key to Gramercy Park
Out of my way and I'm safe, not afraid of the dark
Now I've got the key to Gramercy Park
But I might, might miss breaking in through the bars

No colors anymore, I want them to turn black

With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens every day

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue

Maybe if I look hard enough into a setting sun
I think my love will laugh with me before the morning comes

Dean Brody,"Oh, I'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with the emerald hue
The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue

Oh I'll dance, I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming, my idol was clay
All portion of love had all flown away

Oh he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wond'ring no mis'ry can tell
He's left me no warning, no words of farewell

Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower
That was blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour
He's gone and neglected this pale wildwood flower",Wildflower
Dean Brody,"The house was like a tomb.
I was hiding in my room.
As my brother made his way on down the hall.

I didn't want to say goodbye.
And I was trying to deny there was a war,
And that he got the call.

I watched him from my window
Walking down the drive.
Then I ran down the stairway
Through the front door and I cried

You come back you hear?
And I let him see my tears
I said I'll give you my rookie of DiMaggio.
I'll do anything you want,
Clean your room, or wash your car.
I'll do anything so long as you don't go.
But he said, this is what brothers are for.

Well I have my heroes,
But the one I love the most
Taught me how to hunt and swing a bat.
And I wrote him every night,
I said I miss our pillow fights,
But lately I just wonder where you're at.

Sometimes freedom makes it hard to live.
When it takes things from you that you don't want to give.

I said you come back you hear?
I miss you being near.
Laugh and fish down in the maple grove

I'll do anything you want.
There must be someone I can call,
And just maybe they would let you come back home.
But he wrote, this is what brothers are for.

I may never have to face the anger of those guns,
Or lie cold and wounded in my blood,
Or know the sacrifice and what it must of cost
For him to love me that much.

Well, it had been two years,
And I held back my tears
When I saw him in that wheel chair on the shore.

And as I ran and held him tight,
That's when he looked me in the eye
And said I'm sorry that you have to push me home.
And I said hey, this is what brothers are for.",Brothers

Since I'd got to hang with you

And we'd throw two fly rods in the gun rack
Sweet tea and biscuits on your lap
Sing to brown eyed girl
My guitar in the barn bridge shade

I'd number your freckles
And the times your fishing line tangled
And love on you in the meadow by round bales of hay
No, it ain't hard to remember those good ol' lazy days

And we'd stop by Ernie's General store
Got two maple walnut ice cream cones
Funny how they always seem to get on your nose
Yeah, when you'd ride with me

I'd cuss the moon tryin' to get you back
Ground all the gears while you just laughed
'Cause it was twelve o'clock, porch lights turned off
Yeah, and I was up the creek

Dean Brody,"I'd say, I'm a lover, not a fighter
I never stare nobody down
'Til one night my girl
I could not find her
She never made it back from town

I found my Shannon crying in the woods
A wicked man held her down
So I stuck him deep and I buried him good
Not deep enough to fool the hounds

We took shelter in a chapel
'Neath the blood moon sky
I bought a gun and made Shannon my wife
We jumped in a box-car to old Mexico
Where I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home
No I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home

That train stopped in Tijuana
We built a shack beneath the sun
I make my Shannon margaritas
We watch our children laugh and run, run, run

Sometimes I miss my daddy
Sometimes I miss my mom
But I think they'd be real proud of me
To know the man that I've become

We took shelter in a chapel
'Neath the blood moon sky
I bought a gun and made Shannon my wife
We jumped in a box-car to old Mexico
Where I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home
No I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home

Train, train roll on
Train, train roll on
Train, train roll on, roll on

Shannon, why'd you run with me?
She said,
What was I supposed to do boy?
Just watch you leave?
You'd have broken my heart
You'd have haunted my dreams
Your love, boy, is all I need
Your love, boy, is all I'll ever need

We took shelter in a chapel

No we ain't worth a penny of our bounty back home",Bounty
Dean Brody,"I was watchin’ cartoons on a Saturday morning
And I heard daddy start the truck
I came runnin’ from the house and waved him down
'Cause he was makin’ a run to the dump

We watched the Bears and licked ice cream cones
Take a little walk around
I’ll never forget what my daddy said
The day we pulled that bike from the ground

He said one man’s trash is another man’s gold
If it’s thrown away it’s free to take
A little oil, she’ll be good to go
So I rode that bicycle home
Thumbs up, daddy honkin’ on the horn

I got my first job workin’ on a dairy farm
Drivin’ tractor and bailin’ hay
I’d have to circle around a bog in the ground
Where sat an old Mustang ‘68

One evenin’ I asked that farmer
Why that car was just wastin’ away
He said you can have it for free it don’t mean nothin’ to me
And I couldn’t help but think

One man’s trash is another man’s gold
What someone will throw away is a crying shame
So I towed that Mustang home
Till she could be restored
I got that engine to roar
And boy did that engine roar

It was an awkward blind date we met at a park
She had her little girl taggin’ along
A beautiful smile hadn’t been out in a while
She was a hard working single mom

In time I learned he’d left her
He said “I’m just way too young
To be having a kid, I’m not ready for this
If you keep it I’m good as gone”

He never looked back as she watched him go
She stood there crying in the rain till one January day
She had a beautiful baby girl
Tonight I tuck her in and read her stories
And hold her mama while the sunset glows

My two arms full of this man’s gold
What some men will throw away is a crying shame
Those girls make our house a home
Yeah my cup overflows
With this man’s gold

This man’s gold",Another Man's Gold
Dean Brody,"It was a beautiful sunny morning, so we went for a drive,
Hiked up in the mountains, and we lost track of time.
A kissin' and a huggin', never saw the sun go down,
I said ""Baby we're lost"", and she proceeded to freak out,
So I said,

Baby baby don't panic, I know how to cook bannock.
I can build you a fire, I know you're tired, ain't this romantic?
And that coyote howls, and the grizzly bear he growls.
I can get you through the night, oh yes I can,
I'm a mountain man.

I gave her a little hug, I said ""There's no need to cry"",
I used to be a beaver scout all I need is this Buck knife.
I can carve a hook, pull fish from a brook and I bang on with a gun,
Except tonight I don't really have one, and well, that's half the fun.
Awe you know I'm only kiddin' hun.

Baby baby don't panic, I know how to cook bannock.
I can build you a fire, I know you're tired, ain't this romantic?
I know you're a city girl, but if you had to you could eat a squirrel.
Yeah I'd cook him up just right, you know I can.
I'm a mountain man.

We could pick berries in the moonlight,
'Cause I know which ones to eat.
How to recognize poison ivy,
Should you go lookin' for leaves.

Baby baby don't panic, I know how to cook bannock.
I can build you a fire, I know you're tired, ain't this romantic?
I can bugle an elk, I can rattle a deer, I can grow you a big ol' bushy beard,
And live up here all year and never go back.

Last night the sky was purple and we wanted to share the view
The leaves on the trees are turning and the woods are all ablaze
The smell of the timber burning in the fireplace

Sunday we woke up early and we drove out to Tyson's farms
Gorging ourselves on all the cider and donuts we could fit under both our arms
Picking out penny candy in the country store
Until we collapsed on the porch with our bellies sore

So what's it like to be on your own
A roamin' vagabond
Away from home in search of some forgotten door
Is it half as good as it sounds

And tell me have you really found
The peace and calm we've all been lookin' for
Freckles still misses you, she always sleeps on the floor in your room
Ruth says she smells but you know it's just her very unique perfume

The tree in the back bore apples but they're green and full of worms
I guess we'll sit tight and wait until the cider turns
Everyone sends their love, they still don't really believe you're gone
Everyone's jealous of this crazy oddysey that you're on

Hoping this finds you happy and healthy and sane
Pray that your strength will ease you through the growing pains
So what's it like to be on your own
A roamin' vagabond

Away from home in search of some forgotten door
Is it half as good as it sounds
And tell me have you really found
The peace and calm we've all been lookin' for

So, baby, soon as I get home I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do

would you feel better?
And if I could, with you I would be forever, forever in love, so in love
Making love all through the night, we could hold each other tight
I can take away the pain if you would only let me
Just forget about the past 'cause I want to make it last

Dean Lewis,"There is a swelling storm
And I'm caught up in the middle of it all
And it takes control
Of the person that I thought I was
The boy I used to know
 
But there, is a light
In the dark, and I feel its warmth
In my hands, and my heart
Why can't I hold on?
 
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood
 
The freedom, of falling
A feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through, my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away
 
Through the wind
Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids
Memories, of a stolen place
Caught in the silence 
An echo lost in space
 
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood
 
The freedom, of falling
A feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through, my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away
 
I watched my wild youth
Disappear in front of my eyes
Moments of magic and wonder
It seems so hard to find
Is it ever coming back again?
Is it ever coming back again?
Take me back to the feeling when
Everything was left to find
 
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, oh it always does
 
The freedom, of falling
A feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through, my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away",Waves

Not for a year but ever and a day

May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind

Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Dean Malsack,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues

I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

Dean Malsack,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

Dean Malsack,"The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on

And guess who sighs a lullaby
To nights that never end?

The summer wind
Mmm the summer wind

As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa

Down the road, I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms a'reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on

Down the lane I walk and with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Then I awake and look around me
At four gray walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming

For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm, we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home

By the time I make Albuquerque, she'll be working
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringing

That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried up on some line
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy planted on their columns now that binds me
Or something that somebody said because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track by the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Well I dip my cup of soup back from the gurgling crackling caldron in some train yard
My beard a roughening coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Cupped hands 'round a tin can

Dean Martin,"See the tree how big it's grown
But friend, it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big

I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted
It was just a twig

Then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away
It wouldn't die

Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
I laughed till I cried

She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart
I loved her so

I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve
Two years ago

It would sure embarrass her
When I came home from working late
'Cause I would know

That she'd been sitting there and crying
Over some sad and silly
Late, late show

And Honey, I miss you
I'm being good
I'd love to be with you
If only I could

She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck

Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly
And found her crying needlessly
In the middle of the day

It was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away

And Honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
I'd love to be with you
If only I could

Yes, one day while I wasn't home
When she was there and all alone
The angels came

Now all I have is memories
Of Honey and I wake up nights
And call her name

Now my life's an empty stage
Where Honey lived and Honey played
And love grew up

A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down in the flower bed
That Honey loved

See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend, it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big

I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted
It was just a twig

I grow tired of what I find there
Long for things I left behind

Gonna find a perfect mountain
Gonna stay until I die
Drink of Mother Nature's fountain
Let my worries roll on by
Let my worries roll on by

",A Perfect Mountain
Dean Martin,"Raindrops keep falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothin' seems to fit
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling

So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleepin' on the job, oh
Raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling

But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me, won't defeat me
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Crying's not for me, oh
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'

Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me

Love is magic, love is a gun

Since we've been apart 
I'm in solitude 
Its raining in my heart cause of you 

Love is soothing or it hurts, so badly 
Love is faithful or it flirts, so madly 
Love is gentle or it thrills 
Love is trouble, love will kill, I confess...",Raining in My Heart

Everybody knows we cried our final tears
Everybody knows we wasted all these years
Long ago they said I'd have to sat you free
And the whole world knew with a small exception of me
With a small exception of me the world is wise
With a small exception of me it's no surprise

Stay with me, sway with me

Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak

I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how

And called him a few unkind names

And I stood outside
I passed your house tonight
And I almost cried

Oh how I missed seeing you waiting at the door for me

You no longer cared

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

To dream you need me and have my dreams come true

One for every time you've broke my heart,
And as the door of love between us closes,

I'm tired of forgiving and there is nothing left to do,
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,

'Til at last we had to say goodbye,
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow,

I look at her and I say to myself
There's my lover
Just imagine she comes running to me
For love

I feel so proud I could shout to the crowd
There's my lover
But the crowd mustn't know
For I mustn't show my love

Those are the lips that kiss me
Those are the arms that hold me
Those loving hands caress me
Oh, but the Fates have blessed me

There is my first love, my last love, my all
There's my lover

Oh, you don't have to pay for a day in the country
It's old mother nature who buys
And while we keep going, the breezes are blowing
The cigarette smoke from our eyes

You'll hear beautiful melodies played by an old water mill
And a little red barn is spinning a yarn to the daffodils up on the hill
Oh, there's nothing as gay as a day in the country
Far from the maddening throng
A hobo hobnobbing with bluebird and robin
We warble a merry old song
And go rolly, oh rolly, oh rolly, oh rolly, oh rolling along

How I envy the fellas that live by a shady old nook
And cute little guy who's casting a fly at a trout leaping out of a brook
Oh, there's nothing as gay as a day in the country
Far from the maddening throng
Just grab a valise full and go where it's peaceful
And try vocalizing a song

Dean Martin,"When the deep purple falls
Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to flicker in the sky
Through the mist of a memory
You wander back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh
In the still of the night
Once again I'll hold you tight
Though you're gone your love lives on
When moonlight beams
And as long as my heart will beat
Love we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams
And as long as my heart will beat
Love we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams",Deep Purple
Dean Martin,"You gotta do it gotta do it gotta do it all alone
No one else will do it for you
You're on your own
Do it
It may be love or war or mopping up the floor but just do it
Don't send a friend who's true to pitch your woo for you or you'll rue it
Do it yourself
Don't fake it
If you're a fake you won't make it
Wait for your break and then take it
For time and tide they wait for no man go go go go man
Do it
To prove a point at hand just look at old Miles Standish who blew it
He said to John Alden will you go ask Priscilla to do it
Mile got the heave ho

As she pass she flashed that come-hither look

That could chip a piece off a heart of stone

Consider a bit this interesting little tableau
A look I could read but where would it lead me to
But mischievous elf I labeled myself diablo
And did just exactly what she was sure I'd do
Now at her beck and call
She ties me to the strings of her Spanish shawl
That isn't all
One foot out the door and she gives me the look

I say goodbye now she puts her foot down
I'm flying high now that's when I'm put down
I want to die now she puts her foot down
Freezes me with the look

I'd say you'll do well if you overlook the look

Why must you be mean to me

One thing would still be true

Found the cupboard bare
What happened to that sip of wine
I had hidden there
Over in the corner a little mouse laid on his side
He was wearing such a grin
I thought the mouse had died
Open up the door and let the good times in
Don't let anything stand in your way
Just open up the door and let the good times in
Tomorrow's gonna be a better day
I won't call my baby
When she got to the phone
I kinda had a little feeling
My baby was not alone
She said ""Daddy, I'm busy
Call some other time""
I don't need that woman but I sure could use that dime
Open up the door and let the good times in
Don't let anything stand in your way
Open up the door and let the good times in

Tomorrow's gonna be a better day
Tomorrow's gonna be a better day",(Open Up the Door) Let the Good Times In

Tell me, do you love me too?

But your lips deny they're true

Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?
I'm afraid some day you'll leave me
Saying, ""Can't we still be friends?""

Am I guessing that you love me
Dreaming dreams of you in vain?
I'm confessing that I love you, over again

Dean Martin,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

And cries a million tears

You broke my heart and set me free
But you forgot your memory
And it keeps right on a-hurtin'
Since you're gone

Yes, it keeps right on a-hurtin' every minute of every day
Every hour you're away, I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone

",It Keeps Right on A-Hurtin'
Dean Martin,"The wealthy ones like you look down
On the common folk like me
Makin' bets to what degree of fool we are

Through your rose-colored windows
You see yourself above us
Standin' in the mud gazin' at the stars

But the rich and poor have in common
The common cold, the heartburn and the heartache
Put our pants on just the same

Your worth don't make you better, babe
'Cause I can tread water, babe
As long as you think you make it rain

While you got your raisin, girl
And your diamond-studded world
I got pulled up on the hungry side o' town

I cut my teeth on bacon rind
There ain't no hide as tough as mine
But it might be fun awhile to be your clown

So, get your whip and do your thing
And I'll run around the ring
Ride my white horse, wear my armor too

Ah, but I don't easy blister, babe
I'll be your court jester, babe
Don't think you won't pay fiddler too

Aah, I put your hand in mine
It was a shockin' time to find
The water hot, current strong, deep and wet

You had me strugglin' for a time
A draggin' on your line
But never fear, this fish will never swim

While you're playin' with my mind
I'll be payin' with your money, honey
As long as your account can stand the drain

I'll fan the flame and make it hotter
'Cause I think I can walk on water
As long as you can make it rain

Aww, I'll hang around awhile
Study your style
Come out a whole lot wiser man indeed

'Cause last time anyone as grand
As you appeared and looked around
Found the grandest star up in the East

Hey, but I don't see no halo
Just a little girl with a lot of gold
Want one more trinket for her golden scene

Ah, but you got a hot one hangin', kid
Don't let him say you never did
You best be my guest, make it rain

Aah, make it rain
Babe, make it rain
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain",Make It Rain

Dean Martin,"Hands that are strong but wrinkled
Doing work that never gets done
Hair that's lost some of its beauty
By too many hours in the sun

Eyes that show some disappointment
And there's been quite a lot in my life
She's the foundation I lean on
My woman, my woman, my wife

Everyday has been uphill
We climb but we can't reach the top
I'm weak and I'm easily discouraged
She just smiles when I wanna stop

Lips that are weary but tender
With love that strengthens my life
Saint in a dress made of gingham
My woman, my woman, my wife

Two little babies were born in the spring
But died when the winter was new
I lost control in my mind and my soul
But my woman's faith carried us through

When she reaches that river
Lord, you know what she's worth
Give her that mansion up yonder
'Cause she's been through hell here on earth

Lord, give her my share of Heaven
If I've earned any here in this life
'Cause God, I believe she deserves it
My woman, my woman, my wife
My woman, my woman, my wife

Stars got in my eyes or either rocks got in my head.
All I knew was your two lips kissed me heavenly.
Till yesterday those tender lips kissed goodbye to me.

Well nobody but a fool would love you after the way you've done me.
Broke every vow you made me broke every rule.
Who'd lie awake all night crying till you were out of sight.

Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near

Smile what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile if you'll just smile

Every now and then I hear something whisper in my ear
Telling me somebody else could give me a thrill

Oh, the sneaky little side of me, the kind I want to go and see
If I could be happier walking with somebody new
But every time I start to go, something in my heart says no
And tells me how lucky I am belongin' to you

And this sneaky little side of me is learning fast
'Bout the way I'm livin' and the love I'm givin'
And the love that's gonna last

With soft words I whispered your name
I held you right on the tip of my fingers

My eyes had a vision of sweet lips
Yielding beneath my command
I had your love on the tip of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hand
Yes, I let it slip right through my hand

Somebody took you when I wasn't looking
And I should have known from the start
It's a long, long way from the tip of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart
To the love hidden deep in your heart

I have the invitation that you sent me
You wanted me to see you change your name
I couldn’t stand to see you with another
But I hope you’re happy just the same

Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
That should be ringing out for you and me
Down the aisle with someone else you’re walking
So wedding bells will never ring for me

I planned a little cottage in the valley
I even bought a little band of gold
I thought some day I’d place it on your finger
But now the future looks so dark and cold

Dean Martin,"Fools rush in where angels fear to thread
And so I come to you my love, my heart above my head

But wise men never fall in love so how are they to know

So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Think about her face aglow and ease my mind

Sometimes I call her up at home knowing she's busy
And ask if she could get away and meet me and grab a bite to eat
Then she drops what she's doin' and hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late but she sits waitin' patiently
And smiles when she first sees me 'cause she's made that way

And if that's not lovin' me then all I've got to say

Then all my thoughts of leaving do no good

You got me heart over mind, worried all the time
Knowing you will always be the same
You'll keep hurting me I know, but I just can't let you go
'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change
'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change

Now friends tell me they see you out with others
In my heart I try hard to forget
You come home and tell me you still love me
I still hope there's some chance for us yet

You got me heart over mind, worried all the time
Knowing you will always be the same
You'll keep hurting me I know, but I just can't let you go
'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change
'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change
'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change

",Heart Over Mind
Dean Martin,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You
Dean Martin,"I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air

Pretty bubbles in the air

Dean Martin,"[Chorus]
I'm living in two worlds dividin' my time
Unhappy in your world and lonesome in mine

When I'm in your world I just pretend
That I'm really happy though I don't fit in
Then I drift in my world so cold and alone
I'm living in two worlds where do I belong

[Chorus]

Old friends in your world are new friends to me
So I can't take part in your old memory
Our love shared in two worlds that don't turn the same
We each have our own worlds and neither can change

I've had this lonesome hurtin' feeling all night long
I didn't know I loved her and now she's gone
I think that I just wrote my first country song

I always like to hear those country singers sing
And the way they play those guitars boy they sure do make 'em ring
But when they sing the words I can never sing along
I didn't believe things happen that way I thought our love was here to stay
'Till yesterday she walked away and now they're hittin' home

I think that I just wrote

I wrote some words about the good times that we had
And then some lines about losin' my mind or missin' you so bad

Dean Martin,"I've got a longing way down in my heart
For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine

But today is not the day.

You told me,if I didn't like.
The way,you lived your life.
I was free to go,and find somebody new.
So,walked out door again.
Turned around and walked back in.
There's nobody in the world for me,but you.

IÂ'm gonna leave you some day.
But today is not the day.
When the day will be,I just can't say
I'll try again tomorrow,tried it yesterday.
I'm going to leave you someday,but today is not the day.

The suitcase has packed to go.
Everyother day or so.
But the frontdoor's the only place,it's ever been.
I bought the thing brand new.
But it's worned out for being used.
Carrying it to door and back again.

IÂ'm gonna leave you some day.
But today is not the day.
When the day will be,I just can't say
I'll try again tomorrow,tried it yesterday.
I'm going to leave you someday,but today is not the day..........

Since you left me if you see me with another girl

The world is like a dream and the ripple of the stream is my song

Never ever have a nickel in my jeans
Never ever have a debt to pay
Still I understand what real contentment means
Guess, I was born, born that way

When it's twilight on the trail and my voice is still
Please plant this heart of mine
Underneath that lonesome pine on the hill

There's a breeze, though the wind has died

Where do ya ride tonight?
Are ya roundin' up the dogies,
The strays of long ago,
Are ya on the trail of buffalo?
Empty saddles in the old corral,
Where do ya ride tonight?
Are there rustlers on the border,
Or a band of Navajo
Are ya headin' for the Alamo?
Empty guns covered with rust
Where do ya talk tonight?
Empty boots covered with dust
Where do ya walk tonight?
Empty saddles in the old corral,
My tears would be dried tonight
If you'll only say I'm lonely,
As ya carry my old pal

There's no song, still I hear guitars,
There is no dust, still the ghosts return

Paradise found just hangin' around with you

Hangin' around with you
Wonderful thing to do
Having a time the moment that I'm with you
Finding a love so true
Something I never knew
Something I found just hangin' around with you

Taking a flier around the blue
Floating through space
Traveling higher than heaven's door
Locked in your sweet embrace
Nothing but loving you
Beautiful thing for two
Paradise found just hangin' around with you

Paradise found just hangin' around with you







",Hangin' Around With You
Dean Martin,"I ran all the way home
Just to tell you that I'm sorry
I really didn't mean to be
So mean to you

I ran all the way home
Just to hold you in my arms dear

'Cause I love you

The moment I closed the door behind me
And I heard you cry
I knew I acted blindly
That I couldn't say good bye

Dean Martin,"My heart has found a home now
My lips know where to rest
My heart has found a home now
A home that suits it best
My eyes know who to see now
One side my whole life through

For they see only you
They say home is where the heart is
Where the heart is love endures
And the very nicest part is

Dean Martin,"Never before has my heart felt a thrill like this
Never before
Never before
Never before has the whole world stood still like this
As I gaze at the face I simply adore
After today when they speak of our paradise
I'll smile and I'll say I've been there once or twice
For this is that once in a lifetime
The miracle of your kiss
I've never loved like this
Never before

",Never Before
Dean Martin,"To be loved is a thrilling sensation as thrilling as can be
Though it happens in every nation they greet if differently
Every mademoiselle with pasoolala, every Englishman talks to his pater
Every spittin' Venetian goes tra la la and the Irish say Mother McCree
But when I look at you and I thrill like I do there is only one thing I can say

Oh boy! oh boy! oh boy! oh boy! oh boy!
Oh boy what a joy, a joy, a joy, a joy, a joy
To know that you love me by heaven above me
I never expected to pick you off the vine

(The others will try and try and try and try and try
To give you the eye, the eye, the eye, the eye, the eye)
But when they approach you I'll keep them in line
By telling them oh boy oh boy oh boy you're mine

Certain characters hi-diddle-diddle when cupid comes along
Some mechanics shift gears in the middle and drummers kick the gong
Every cowboy I know hollers yipee
Every clown in the circus goes oopla
Every sailor in port hollers anchors aweigh
And an Indian gives you a ugg!
But when you hold me tight like you're doing tonight
There's only one thing I can say

Oh boy! oh boy! oh boy! oh boy! oh boy!
Oh boy what a joy, a joy, a joy, a joy, a joy
To know that you love me by heaven above me
I never expected to pick you off the vine
(The others will try and try and try and try and try
To give you the eye , the eye, the eye, the eye, the eye)
But when they approach you I'll keep them in line
By telling them oh boy oh boy oh boy
Oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy you're mine",Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Oh Boy!
Dean Martin,"Until you find the one you want to want you
Until you find her eyes constantly haunt you
Until no other lips can ever thrill you
You'll never know the glory of a heart in love
Until you're swept away with an emotion
As high as stars above, as great as the ocean
Don't say you've been in love for it isn't true
Until you love someone as I love you
(Until you find the one
As high as stars above)
Don't say you've been in love for it isn't true
Until you love someone as I love you

When you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet
You're in love
When you walk in a dream but you know you're not dreaming signore
Scuzza me, but you see, back in old Napoli

But now I know I'll never show my love to anyone
'Cause wham bam you broke my heart and I hope that you had fun
(Wham bam thank you ma'am) Hope you're satisfied
You took my heart and tore it apart you hurt me deep inside
I'll never be a fool again you really crushed my pride
(Wham bam thank you ma'am) Hope you're satisfied

My shirt tail ran right up my back just like a window shade

You took my heart and you tore it apart you hurt me deep inside
I'll never be a fool again you really crushed my pride
(Wham bam thank you ma'am) and I hope you're satisfied
I made a mess of things I guess but now I'll recognize
The next young thing that tries to say its a love-light in her eye
The love light that you spoke about was only just a flame
'Cause every tome you meet a man it lights right up again

One could not walk,

The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.

I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,

Long long ago
Long long ago
Well they say it was better in oh so many ways
Long long ago, long ago

They couldn't go to a movie show, 
listen to the radio, go for a ride in a car
And on a very cold and wintery night
They couldn't sit and watch a TV fight

And when the summer came
They will have to take a dame all bundled up to the beach
They didn't know a girl could look so cute

In a bikini suit
Oh how they sing of the good, good old days
Long long ago
Long long ago
They couldn't swing in the good old days
Long long ago, long ago

This evening has been (been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (i'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)

My mother will start to worry (beautiful what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (listen to the fireplace roar)

So really I'd better scurry (beautiful please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (put some records on while I pour)

The neighbors might think (baby, it's bad out there)
Say what's in this drink? (no cabs to be had out there)

I wish I knew how (your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (i'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)

I ought to say, no, no, no sir (mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (what's the sense in hurtin' my pride?)

I really can't stay (oh baby don't hold out)
But baby, it's cold outside

I simply must go (but baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (but baby, it's cold outside)

Your welcome has been(how lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (look out the window at this dawn)

My brother will be there at the door (waves upon the tropical shore)

My maiden aunts mind is vicious (gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (never such a blizzard before)

I've gotta get home(but baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say lend me a coat(it's up to your knees out there)

You've really been grand (i thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (how can you do this thing to me?)

There's bound to be talk tomorrow (think of my lifelong sorrow)

And a twinkle in his eye
Senoritas he can win
Always for another guy

Italians love to sip a cup of cappuccino
And listen to the man who plays the mandolino
You offer him a cigarette a glass of wine
That's how he's paid to serenade your lady fair

With his little mandolino
And a twinkle in his eye
Senoritas he can win
Always for another guy

He seems like such a happy man, the man who plays the mandolino
He sings a song of sweet romance for all the lovers as they dance
But all he's holding in his arms is just a little mandolino
He has no woman of his own so every night he walks alone

With his little mandolino
And a twinkle in his eye
Senoritas he can win
Always for another guy

(And while he's strumming songs of love the man who plays the mandolino)
(His eyes are always looking for a senorina to adore)
He drinks a toast to his true love each time he lifts a glass of vino
And so until that lucky day he looks for her along the way

And a twinkle in his eye
Senoritas he can win
Always for another guy

Long long ago
Long long ago
Well they say it was better in oh so many ways
Long long ago, long ago

They couldn't go to a movie show, listen to the radio, go for a ride in a car
And on a very cold and wintery night
They couldn't sit and watch a TV fight
And when the summer came
They will have to take a dame all bundled up to the beach
They didn't know a girl could look so cute
In a bikini suit

Oh how they sing of the good, good old days
Long long ago
Long long ago
They couldn't swing in the good old days
Long long ago, long ago

Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva lontano laggiu

Knock on wood as well I should
For all that you're making of me
Never thought you'd love me

And when I look up at the stars
And ask them all what's new
They join me in the answer Darling it's you

Dean Martin,"I'm praying for rain in California
So the grapes can grow and they can make more wine
And I'm sitting in a honky in Chicago
With a broken heart and a woman on my mind

I matched the man behind the bar for the jukebox
And the music takes me back to Tennessee
And they asked who's the fool in the corner crying
I say, a little ole wine drinker me

I came here last week from down in Nashville
Cause my baby left for Florida on a train
I thought I'd get a job and just forget her
But in Chicago, the broken heart is still the same

I matched the man behind the bar for the jukebox
And the music takes me back to Tennessee
When they ask, who's the fool in the corner crying
I say, a little ole wine drinker me
I say, a little ole wine drinker me","Little Ole Wine Drinker, Me"
Dean Martin,"(Si bon si bon)
See'est si bon (Si bon si bon)
Lovers say that in France (Si bon si bon)
When they thrill to romance (Si bon si bon)
It means that it's so good
Ah see'est si bon (Si bon si bon)
So I say it to you (Si bon si bon)
Like the French people do (Si bon si bon)
Because it's oh so good
Every word every sigh every kiss dear
Leads to only one thought and it's this dear
Oh it's on so good (Si bon si bon)
Nothing else can replace (Si bon si bon)
Just your slightest embrace (Si bon si bon)
And if you only would
Would be my own for the rest of my days
I would whisper this phrase
See'est si bon (Si bon si bon)
The river Seine (Si bon si bon)
The Left Bank (Si bon si bon)
The Eiffel Tower (Si bon si bon)
The meatballs, pizzas, school cheating, now that's stuffs pretty good too
(En voyant notre mine ravie)
I have only one thought and it's this dear
Oh it's so good (Si bon si bon)
Nothing else can replace (Si bon si bon)
Just your slightest embrace (Si bon si bon)
And if you only would
Be my own for the rest of my days
I would whisper this phrase
My darling see'est si bon (Si bon si bon)
Gigi si bon (Si bon si bon)
Mimi si bon (Si bon si bon)
And all those mademoiselles that are si bon
In fact you'd be surprised how much good stuff there is around here Frank (Si bon si bon)",C' Est Si Bon
Dean Ray,"I'm sinking like a resting stone.
With demons in my head.
I feel you from my skin to bone, 
With darkness in the air.

Chasing down your silhouettes, 
I find there's nothing left.
Facing down a lonely road, 
Into the pure unknown.  
But I'll keep coming back!

You can steel my mind, 
Twist it for a while,
But you can't take my pride.
You can watch me crack, 
Throw me way off track, but I'll keep coming back.

You can steel my mind, 
twist it for a while, 
but you can't take my pride.
You can watch me crack, 
Throw me way off track, 
But I'll keep coming,
I'll keep coming back!

Streets of heaven never had a name.
I found my own way there.
I know I'm bound to lose my way again, 
Cause love and war is never fair.

Facing down a lonely road,
Into the pure unknown.
But I'll keep coming back!

You can steel my mind, 
twist it for a while, 
but you can't take my pride.
You can watch me crack, 
Throw me way off track,
But I'll keep coming back!

You can steel my mind, 
twist it for a while, 
but you can't take my pride.
You can watch me crack,
Throw me way off track,
But I'll keep coming,
I'll keep coming back!

Take my mind, 
Take my mind to rest!

You can steel my mind, 
twist it for a while, 
but you can't take my pride.
You can watch me crack,
Throw me way off track,
But I'll keep coming back!

Dean Reed,"Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'
On this, our weddin' day
Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'
Wait, wait along

I do not know what fate awaits me
I only know I must be brave
And I must face a man who hates me
Or lie a coward, a craven coward
Or lie a coward in my grave

Oh, to be torn 'twixt love and duty
S'posin' I lose my fair-haired beauty
Look at that big hand move along
Nearin' high noon

He made a vow while in state prison
Vowed it would be my life or his'n
I'm not afraid of death but oh
What will I do if you leave me?

Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'
You made that promise as a bride
Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

I'm gonna raise a holler
'Bout workin' all summer
Just to try to earn a dollar
Well, I went to the boss man
Tried to get a break

You gotta work late'

Sometimes I wonder what am I gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well, my Mom and Poppa told me
Son, you gotta earn some money
If you want to use the care
To go riding next Sunday
Well, I wouldn't go to work
I told the boss I was sick
He said 'You can't use the car

Dean Shostak,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone
Till the day draws to an end.
But when the sun goes down
And the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone
I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night, you're so close to me.
All through the night, from a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy.

When dawn comes to waken me
You're never there at all.
I know you've forsaken me,
Till the shadows fall.
But then once again
I can dream,
I've the right
To be close to you
All through the night.",All Through the Night
