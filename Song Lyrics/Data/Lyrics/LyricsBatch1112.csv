Regina Marie Williams,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you",There Is No Greater Love
Regina Regina,"(Bob Regan/Michael Noble)

I wanted to know about tenderness
About the magic in a kiss and all the rest
It was easy for you to play the part
Of a romeo to my willing heart
I gave it freely
Oh you showed me

Chorus:
Just a little more than I wanted to know
Just a little further than I wanted to go
I found out if you twist me, turn me, sooth me, burn me
You leave me all mixed up
that's just a little more than I wanted to know about love

Its a real good lesson I learned from you
The more you give the more you stand to lose
I gave my all, hey that's the deal
But what I got was all to real
The joy and the lonesome
The good and then some

(Repeat Chorus)

Just a little more than I wanted to know
Just a little further than I wanted to go
I found if you heal me, break me, kill me, save me
Hurts all too much
that's just a little more than I wanted to know about love
About love",More Than I Wanted to Know
Regina Regina,"(Tim Mensy/Liz Hengber)

Once again its calling to her
Its a sound she knows
Through the night its getting louder
It must know she's home
Its trying to wear her down
As she sits softly crying
Feeling weak but being strong 
She lets that telephone ring

Chorus:
she used to run each time he called
She'd always give in
His voice would melt her 
And wash away his sins
She'd forgive him
But tonight she's keeping 
That hand from reaching
she'll let that telephone ring

From a phone booth he just listens
Why don't she pick up
He's been trying now for hours
Still he won't hang up
He's feeling desperate now
As the rain starts falling
He can't face it that its over
He lets that telephone ring

(repeat chorus)

She turns the light off
Lays her head down
Lets that telephone ring",She'll Let That Telephone Ring
Regina Spektor,"I went flyin' out of my window 
I went flyin' out of my window 
Been caught doin' it once or twice 
But it feels so real nice 
Oh it feels so real nice 

Saw the earth and I saw the sky 
Saw the earth and I saw the sky 
Been caught doin' it once or twice
But it feels so real nigh 
Oh it feels so real nigh 
Oh it feels so real nigh 

Went to school with them boring teachers 
Who thought they was all my preachers 
So I went starin' out of my window 
I went starin' out of my window 
Been caught doin' it once or twice 
But it feels so real nice 
Oh it feels so real nice, 
Oh it feels so real nice, that I might even do it again 

One of them took me with him to sleep 
Said not to make a peep 
Said it'll be a secret we keep 
So I didn't make a peep 
Kissed my cheek and rubbed my feet 
But his kissin' didn't taste so sweet 
Told him I just wanted to sleep 
So he got mad 
And he got madder, and he got maddest of them all 

Sent me flyin' out of his window 
Sent me flyin' out of his window 
Not caught once, not caught twice 

And I've been flyin' ever since 
And I've been flyin' in the skies",Flyin
Regina Spektor,"I want to sing to you my love 
My only love and happiness 
Don't be so blue so blue my love 
Take off your shoes take off my dress 
I want to sing to you my love 
My only love and happiness 
Don't be so blue so blue my love 
This too shall pass this too shall pass 

But tell me, what have I done to deserve you? 
Must have done something cause that's how it works 
Must have been kind to kittens and birds
In a previous life must have thought happy thoughts

'cause there, you were there right beside me 
Then somehow inside me while inside myself 
Books on the shelf thoughts on the shelf 
Hands to myself, i should definitely keep my hands to myself 

Love is a dangerous pastime 
Caught between madness and gladness of flight 
Nothing is wrong and nothing is right 
Falling asleep in your arms every night 

But Love's such a strange situation 
Full of frustration and anger and fear 
Everything's tears 
Nobody hears 
Nobody's here, and nobody hears

I want to sing to you my love 
My only love and happiness 
Don't be so blue so blue my love 
Take off your shoes take off my dress 
I want to sing to you my love 
My only love and happiness 
Don't be so blue so blue my love 
This too shall pass, this too shall pass",I Want to Sing
Regina Spektor,"Mr. Sunshine in the morning 
In the morning light 
Won't you come down from the ceiling 
Won't you stay the night 
Baby won't you stay the night 

In the summer I remember days so long and hot 
These past weeks it has been raining 
And now my song's a flood 
Baby now my song is a flood 

You've been driving down that same road 
Road rage in your eyes 
So won't you come down from the ceiling 
Won't you hear my cries 
Won't you hear my cries",Sunshine
Regina Spektor,"I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow 
But its better than sleeping by the wasteside of today 
All the barbershops and funeral-homes were open 
And the customers were coming and the business was doing great 

I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow 
Just dreaming dreams and drooling on my bed 
All the people in my town would be born 
Then they'd get themselves a little hair cut 
And then promptly after they'd be dead 

I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow 
When a drunk girl awoke me on the train 
But I did not see her stumbling and I did not hear her mumbling 
As I dubbed myself a passenger 
And kindly stepped away 

I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow I was sleeping 
I was sleeping I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow 
I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow of tomorrow 
Ladies and gentlemen 
I was just sle-aah

But it's better than sleeping by the wasteside of today

Regina Spektor,"Aching to pupate
Aching to pup-p-p-pate
[repeats 4x]
Pu-pupate, pu pate,
Pu-pate, pu-pupate, pu pa-ate?

I should peddle butterflies
There's a shortage in the city,
I'll stand on the street corner
All mysterious and giddy,
When the passers by pass by
I will open up my trenchcoat,
They will see the butterflies
Dangling like fake rolexes?

Every morning I wake up
With a purpose and a smirk
I'll put on my fake mustache
I'll drink Heineken eat cornflakes?

Then I'll call my mum and dad
Tell them that I'm doing fine,
Or I'll write a tipsy letter
To a real good friend of mine,
Or I'll jump upon the bed
Waltzing madly with the broomstick
But before I leave the house
I will paint my lips with lipstick?

But peddling is a dirty sport
There's competition in the city,
Everyone is on a street corner
All mysterious and giddy.
Some are selling bags and shoes,
Some are selling books and gold,
I've been standing here for days
Not one butterfly's been sold?

And how I'm

Regina Spektor,"I don't care that flowers grow for you,
And me, and me
You don't know what love is till you see,
Her standing there
A web of skin and nails and hair
A web of skin and nails and hair
And bones and bones,
And thorns
Rushing in, out her hair
You think you are alive, but you are dead
You keep, on driving in your car asleep
I'm driving in your car
I dont know why flowers grow in winter time
The sky turns gray the sun don't shine
And people rush to be on time
For warmth they wrap them selves in woolen cloaks
And hats and scarves
Like larva in their incubators
And drive and drive
[noises]
And drive and drive and drive
Until they get away",Lounge
Regina Spektor,"I know that you cannot be
Here
I know that you are not mine
Now
Looking out the window
At another window
I see toenails changing colors
Like the leaves of Fall

If you often smile
But often don't
Smile
Which do you do more often
Smile, or not?
I dreamt a hydrant
Was covered in snow
A white light glowing below...

I know that you cannot be
Here
I know that you are not mine
Now

At another window
I see toenails changing colors

Regina Spektor,"Walking home from work
Stop at the supermarket
The condiment aisle
A jar of pickles catches the eye
Made eye contact with a solitary pickle
But the jar took it home
Then made up the stairs
And made it through the doorway
And waded through the floor
Tried to head in the general direction of the bathroom
The truest room in the whole damn hous

saying love is the answer to a question that I
Have forgotten
And I know I've been asked
So the answer's got to be love

so feeding time with TV
Then sleeping time not sleepy so reading time with pickle
But where the bedside lamp had been
Is now emanating soft soft green
Has it always been this way?
Is it possible that all this magic went unnoticed?

maybe now things will start to change, 
And life will turn a better page
No more rage.

saying love is the answer to a question that I
Have forgotten
But I know I've been asked
And the answer's got to be love
Love

Tomorrow back to work again
But run to the supermarket
Running hopeful through the aisles
Haven't been this happy in a long time
But not a single jar will smile
After hours
Man pickle jars are just pickle jars
And pickles are just pickles
Ingredients: water, salt, cucumbers, garlic, and pickling spices

But love is the answer to a question that I
Have forgotten
And I know I've been asked
And the answer's got to be love
Love is the answer to a question that I 
Have forgotten
And I know I've been asked
And the answer's got to be love

Regina Spektor,"I had a dream
Crispy crispy Benjamin Franklin came over
Baby-sat all four of my kids

Then in my dream
I told the doctor off
He said if you don't want to do it
Then you don't have to do it
He said the truth is
You'll be okay, anyway

Then in my dream
Crispy crispy Benjamin Franklin and the doctor
Went and had a talk with my boss

Something about insurance policies
They kept the door closed at all times
I couldn't hear or see

When they came out they said
You'll be okay, anyway
And I smiled cause I'd known it all along.

No thank you no thank you no thank you no thank you
I don't have to pay for this shit
I couldn't afford chemo like I couldn't afford a limo
And on any given day I'd rather ride a limousine

No thank you no thank you no thank you no thank you
I ain't about to to die like this

I'm-a gonna go out in style go out in style

When I woke up
My kids were being quiet
I knew it was a dream right away
I called the limousine company

Then I got dressed
I dressed the kids as well
The limousine pulled in
And we piled in

The doctor he asked which way we were headed
I said, Sir, let's just go west and he listened obediently,
Sophie only wants to listen to radio BBC
Michael sat on my knees and whispered to me
All about the meanies
Jacqueline was being such a big girl
With her cup of tea looking out of the window
And Barbara
She looks just like my mom
Oh my, Barbara
She looks so much like my mom

And still I refuse to throw them away
Some of the bulbs never opened quite fully
They might so I'm waiting and staying awake

Things I have loved I'm allowed to keep
I'll never know if I go to sleep

Regina Spektor,"A man walks out of his apartment
It is raining
He's got no umbrella
He starts running beneath the awnings
Trying to save his suit
Trying to save his suit
Tryin' to dryin' to tryin' to dry but no good

When he gets to the crowded subway platform
He takes off both of his shoes
He steps right into somebody's fat loogie
And everyone who sees him says ""ew""
Everyone who sees him says ""ew""

But he doesn't care
Cause last night he got a visit
From the ghost of corporate future
The ghost said take off both your shoes
Whatever chances you get
Especially when they're wet

He also said
Imagine you go away on a business trip one day
And when you come back home
Your children have grown and you never made your wife moan
You children have grown and you never made your wife moan

And people make you nervous
You'd think the world was ending
And everybody's features have somehow started blending
And everything is plastic
And everyone's sarcastic
And all your food is frozen
It needs to be defrosted
You'd think the world was ending
You'd think the world was ending
You'd think the world was ending right now

Well maybe you should just drink a lot less coffee
And never ever watch the ten o'clock news
Maybe you should kiss someone nice
Or lick a rock
Or both
Maybe you should cut your own hair
Cause that can be so funny
It doesn't cost any money
And it always grows back
Hair grows even after you're dead

People are just people
They shouldn't make you nervous
The world is everlasting
It's coming and it's going
If you don't toss your plastic
The streets won't be so plastic
And if you kiss somebody
Then both of you'll get practice

The world is everlasting
Put dirtballs in your pockets
Put dirtballs in your pockets
And take off both your shoes
Cause people are just people
People are just people
People are just people like you

The world is everlasting
It's coming and it's going
The world is everlasting
It's coming and it's going",Ghost of Corporate Future
Regina Spektor,"The food that I'm eating is suddenly tasteless
I know I'm alone now
I know what it tastes like

So break me to small parts
Let go in small doses
But spare some for spare parts
There might be some good ones!

Like you might make a dollar
I'm inside your mouth now
Behind your tonsils
Peaking over your molars

You're talking to her now
You've eaten something minty
And you're making that face that I like
When you're going in for the kill kill
For the killer kiss kiss for the kiss kiss

I need your money
It'll help me
I need your car and I need your love
I need your money
It'll help me
I need your car and I need your love
So won't you help a brother out?
Won't you help a brother out?
Won't you help a brother out out out out out?

Just break me to small parts
Let go in small doses
But spare some for spare parts

Now you must take me
How am I supposed to be?
I don't have my thorns now

And I feel them sprouting
They'll grow right through if I don't watch it
They'll grow through even if I watch it
And a sunset couldn't save me now

And baobabs some more
But you cant out-wait fate

You have tamed me
Now you must take me

And I wouldn't raise my child inside the city anyway

And they know about buying shit and they know about sex
And they know about investment banking and also about brokerage firms
And the know about the numbers and they know about the words
And they know about the bottom lines and also about stones
And they know about careers and about the real deals
And they all grow up and be come people's people with people skills.

His nose, it was red
In Gelterkinden I forgot to frown

In Paris I saw a big fish
Swimming slow in the Seine
It made me hopeful that someday our
Water will be breathable again

In Frankfurt I heard ein zwei drei
Counting cookies and no one was shot
In Berlin stopped by the polizai
For drunk driving and everyone smiled
In Prague I knew I'd been a witch
Burnt alive, a pyre of Soviet kitsch
It made me miss my Moscow mother
It made me miss my New York nothing

In Montpelier I stayed in a chateau
A boy climbed into my bed and he knew no boundaries
And in Amsterdam I got quite crazy
Might have been all the tulips and canals
Or it might have been all that hash, and in
Barcelona, buenos dias, chocolate, le Picasso
And in Brussels, clean-cut hostel
And in London, me and the French existentialistsâ?¦

In Corsica I floated away
All the way to Marseilles
I should have held an afterparty
For all the thoughts I didn't say

With bad breath and a really good tan
In Gelterkinden I remembered how to laugh
And I never ever forgot it againâ?¦",Düsseldorf [*]

As if she mean it
As if it's hell down here
In the smoke-filled world
Where the jokes are cold, they don't laugh at jokes
They laugh at tragedies

Corner street societies
But they believe her
They never leave her while she sings
She make them feel safe

She says, 'I can sing this song so blue
That you will cry in spite of you
Little wet tears on your baby's shoulder
Little wet tears on your baby's shoulder

And I have walked these streets so long
There ain't nothin' right, there ain't nothin' wrong
But the little wet tears on my baby's shoulder
Little wet tears on my baby's shoulder.'

Takes a look around, no regrets, no regrets

That you will cry in spite of you

Learned to sing and learned to cry

Regina Spektor,"This is how it works
It feels a little worse
Than when we drove our hearse
Right through that screaming crowd
While laughing up a storm
Until we were just bone
Until it got so warm
That none of us could sleep
And all the Styrofoam
Began to melt away
We tried to find some worms
To aid in the decay
But none of them were home
Inside their catacomb
A million ancient bees
Began to sting our knees
While we were on our knees
Praying that disease
Would leave the ones we love
And never come again

On the radio
We heard November Rain
That solo's really long
But it's a pretty song
We listened to it twice
'Cause the DJ was asleep

This is how it works
You're young until you're not
You love until you don't
You try until you can't
You laugh until you cry
You cry until you laugh
And everyone must breathe
Until their dying breath

No, this is how it works
You peer inside yourself
You take the things you like
And try to love the things you took
And then you take that love you made
And stick it into some
Someone else's heart
Pumping someone else's blood
And walking arm in arm
You hope it don't get harmed
But even if it does
You'll just do it all again

And on the radio
You hear November Rain
That solo's awful long
But it's a good refrain
You listen to it twice

Taking off his belt, taking off his pants 
Filling up the bathtub, getting ready to go in for a swim

And this other lady at the bar and she was trying to sell gin

Started taking off his pants, started taking off his shoes

And he says, no--I can't drown 
Simply because...shhhh...

A man destined to drown can never burn

So he grew healthy aloe vera plants by the window 

Healthy teeth in his mouth 
Healthy hair on his head 
He grew healthy wavy brown hair on his head

Regina Spektor,"I'm the king's thirty second son
Born to him in thirty second's time
Born to him the night still young
Born to him with two eyebrows on
And that's all I was wearing
When I woke up staring at the world

My mom had been around the graves of queens
But not at all a sex machine
She liked to keep her body clean, clean
Thought the world to be quite obscene
But she retired to her chamber
And we remain quite strangers

And to see me made her awful sad
And to touch me made her awful sad
And to see me made her awful
And to touch me made her awful

I'm the king's thirty second son
And all it took was thirty second's time
But a spoiled little prince I was not
Had a chamber maid and a chamber pot
And there's thirty one others just like me
There's thirty one others I can be

Someimtes I'd stand by the royal wall
The sky'd be so big that it broke my soul
And I stood on my toes to catch a glimpse
Of my mother's eyes and my mother's skin
And she retired to her chamber
And we remain quite strangers

And to see me made her awful sad
And to touch me made her awful sad
And to see me made her awful
And to touch me made her awful


And one morning I woke up
And I thought Oedipus, Oedipus, Oedipus, Oedipus
Then one morning I woke up and I thought Rex, Rex, Rex

Sometimes I stand by the royal gate
People screaming love and hate
And they scream
And they scream

And they scream
Long live the king,
Long live the queen

And to see me made her awful sad

Regina Spektor,"All of the prisoners serving life sentences
Wait for the earth to suddenly shake
For the walls to somehow suddenly come crumbling, tumbling and
For the bars to somehow magically break

Aw, there's nothing wrong with them
That a thousand bucks can't fix
That a thousand arms can't hold down
In the ground they're tattooing the stones with
cusses like cavemen - your momma was here

But they want to run through the air with no barriers or obstacles
Gunmen or guard dogs or priests
And to rise from the mud and start over and over
With the people all dead.

If Hans Christian Andersen could've had his way with me
Then none of this shit would have ever gone down

And began to breathe
And all the gods in all the worlds
Began colliding on a backdrop of blue

Blue lips

He took a step but then felt tired
He said, I'll rest a little while
But when he tried to walk again
He wasn't a child

Real fast and no one ever smiled

Then they chopped it down to make white picket fences
They marched along the railroad tracks
And smiled real wide for the camera lenses
They made it past the enemy lines
Just to become enslaved in the assembly lines

You can't believe it
You were always singing along
It was so easy and the words so sweet
You can't remember

You're using your headphones to drown out your mind
It was so easy, and the words so sweet
You can't remember
You try to move your feet

He opens the window just to feel the chill
He hears that outside a small boy just starting to cry
'Cause it's his turn but his brother won't let him try

I've got a perfect body cause my eyelashes catch my sweat

Waiting for the salty water to cover up my ears
But every time the tide come in to take me home

Maybe one day you will understand
I don't want nothing from you but to sweetly hold your hand
Till that day just please don't be so down

Regina Spektor,"Some said the local lake had been enchanted
Others said it must have been the weather
The neighbors were trying to keep it quiet
But I swear that I could hear the laughter
So they jokingly nicknamed it the porridge
Cause overnight that lake had turned as thick as butter
But the local kids would still go swimming, drinking
Saying that to them it doesn't matter

If you just hold in your breath til you come back up in full
Hold in your breath til you thought it through, you fool

The genius next door was busing tables
Wiping clean the ketchup bottle labels
Getting high and mumbling German fables
Didn't care as long as he was able
To strip his clothes off by the dumpsters
At night while everyone was sleeping
And to wade midway into that porridge
Just him and the secret he was keeping

If you just hold in your breath til you come back up in full
Hold in your breath til you thought it through, you foolish child

In the morning the film crews start arriving
With donuts, coffee and reporters
The kids were waking up hungover
The neighbors were starting up their cars
The garbageman were emptying the dumpsters
Atheists were praying full of sarcasm
And the genius next door was sleeping
Dreaming that the antidote is orgasm

I found a wallet
Inside were pictures of your small family
You were so young
Your hair dark brown
You had been born in nineteen fifty-three

Your winter birthday
Was stamped on the plastic
Of a license so recently expired
I was so tired
As I walked through my door
I laid all the contents of your wallet on the floor

And like a holy relic
Or a mystery novel
I thumbed them in the dim light

An old stick of juicy fruit

Regina Spektor,"You went into the kitchen cupboard
Got yourself another hour and gave
Half of it to me
We sat their looking at the faces
Of the strangers in the pages
Until we knew them mathematically

They were in our minds
Until forever
But we didn't mind
We didn't know better

So we made our own computer
Out of macaroni pieces
And it did our thinking
While we lived our lives
It counted up our feelings
And divided them up even
And it called our calculation
Perfect love

Didn't even know
That love was bigger
Didn't even know
Didn't even know that love was so, so
Hey hey hey hey

Hey this fire, hey this fire
I'm burning us up
Hey this fire, hey this fire
I'm burning us
Oh, oo oo oo, oo oo oo oo

So we made the hard decision
And we each made an incision
Past our muscles and our bones
Our hearts were little stones

Pulled 'em out they weren't beating
And we weren't even bleeding
As we lay them on our granite counter top

We beat 'em up against each other
We beat 'em up against each other
We struck 'em hard against each other
We struck 'em so hard, so hard til they sparked

Hey this fire, hey this fire
I'm burning us up
Hey this fire, hey this fire
I'm burning us up

That's it, it's split it won't recover
Just frame the halves and call them brothers
Find their fathers and their mothers 
If you remember who they are

Over and over they call us their friends
Can't we find something else to pretend?
Like nobody's won and we're safe at the end

In the darkness the film machine's spinning
So let's leave it on
We'll be out in the street 
before anyone knows that we're gone

That's it, it's split, it can't recover
Just frame the halves and call them a whole
And chip at the bricks and fill up your pockets 
With the pieces of the wall that you stole

The hunt is on, everyone's chasing
Everyone's chasing a shot
A shot rings out, nobody wants it
Nobody wants it to stop

They try to remember but still they forget
That the heart beats in threes
Just like a waltz
And nothing can stop you from dancing

Rise from your cold hospital bed
I'll tell you, you're not dying
Everyone knows you're going to live
So you might as well start trying

The piano is not firewood yet
But the cold does get cold
So it soon might be that
I'll take it apart, call up my friends
And we'll warm up our hands by the fire

Don't look so shocked
Don't judge so harsh
You don't know
You are only spying
Everyone knows it's going to hurt
But at least we'll get hurt trying

The piano is not firewood yet
But a heart can't be helped
And it gathers regret
Someday you'll wake up and feel a great pain
And you'll miss every toy you ever owned

You'll want to go back
You'll wish you were small
Nothing can solve your crying
You'll take the clock off of your wall
And you'll wish that it was lying

Love what you have and you'll have more love
You're not dying
Everyone knows you're going to love
Though there's still no cure for crying",Firewood

To grab their guitars and run out to the hall

Start counting all your money and friends before you come back again

For every road we can retrace
For every memory we can't face
For every name that's been erased

May I propose a little toast?

Regina Spektor,"She sets her alarm
Five minutes to midnight
And wakes just in time
To greet the new year
Remembers the kisses
Remembers the laughter
And all that's gone away

She shuffles around
Turning the lights on
Goes to the kitchen
Gets the champagne
Opens the window
And wrapped in a blanket
Begins to count and wait
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

Happy New Year, happy New Year

They say you can hear it
Over the island
Starting in Times Square and spreading throughout
A roar like the ocean
It comes from a distance
Grows louder then turns quiet

She sits in a dream
Or in a memory
While old conversations play in her ears
Sometimes the minutes feel longer than hours
Some days feel long as years

She just glad she gets to be around
To see another spring come to this town

Happy New Year, happy New Year
To you

She sets her alarm
Five minutes to midnight
And wakes just in time
To say her goodbyes
Thanking the old year for all it has brought her
No mention of the things it took away

She shuffles around
Turning the lights out
Closes the window
Checks on the locks
Folds up the blanket
Empties the bottle
And leaves it in the hallway dark

She's just glad she gets to be around
To see another spring come to this town

Happy New Year, happy New Year
Happy New Year, happy New Year

Regina Spektor,"He went to visit an old, old friend
And it was long, long overdue
And though they stayed up very late
They never talked out of turn or tune
And every time they'd say goodbye
Well he'd just stay another while
They started from a distant place
And were so happy face to face

The one who left wanted everything
The one who stayed never wanted more
It's not your choice, it's how you're built
It's in a blueprint of your soul
The one who left, he dropped his smile
And they sat quiet for a while
Then the one who stayed began to speak
And in his words, he answered why

I'm just another drop in the bucket
I'm just another song on a jukebox
I'm just another face in the crowd
Another fish in the sea

Something to being one of the many
Something to being one in the masses
Something to being surrounded by others and not alone by yourself

I never wanted the bright lights and my eyes are much too quiet
I never wanted them pointing their fingers at me
Oh no, but

Something to being one of the many
Something to being one in the masses
Something to being surrounded by others and not alone by yourself

The one who left he knew it then
And he would never doubt again
He loved this life, he loved his friend
But he'd keep running 'til the end
All words they said hovered above
All of the pain, all of the love
They hugged goodbye
And in his room, he sang real quiet to the moon

Something to being one of the many who get to sing the songs on the jukebox
Who get to stay awake all night and dream half of the day
Something to waking up in a new town
Something to singing songs to a new crowd
Something to being surrounded by others and not alone by yourself

I never wanted the bright lights and my eyes are much too quiet
I never wanted them pointing their fingers at me
Oh no, but

Something to being one of the many who get to sing the songs on the jukebox

Regina Spektor,"Somewhere below the grand hotel
There is a tunnel that leads down to hell
Take the dumbwaiter, the laundry chute
Then sneak through the hall past the boy's shining boots 
Then left at the courtyard through the old garden
Where all the bellhops smoke with the guards
And then you run to the old lake house
Down to the old lake house
Run to the old lake house where it begins

Under the floorboards there's a deep well
That leads to a spring that sprung up in hell
That's where old devils danced and kissed
And made their blood pacts in the ancient myths
And running through forest they screamed in chorus
While piercing fair maiden's chests with their horns
And then they lay in the grass 'til the dawn came
Sleeping away 'til the dawn came
Lay in the grass where now stands the grand hotel

The Maître D' and a fancy chef
Silver's real, the liquor's top shelf
Play some tennis, swim in a pool
Stroll the garden shady and cool
You won't care that the devils
Won't mind that the devils
Won't know that the devils are near

Somewhere below the grand hotel
There is a tunnel that leads straight to hell
But no one comes up for the souls anymore
They come for some comfort and for the dance floor
And hiding sharp horns under fedoras
Do not disturb signs instead of a chorus
They toss and turn 'til the dawn comes
On soft sheets 'til the dawn comes
No one sleeps at the grand hotel

Room service, mini-bar
Scented soaps, chauffeured cars
Stay a day, stay a week
Here's the tunnel, take a peek
Just call up your friends at the front desk
Any hour at the front desk
Call up your friends at the grand hotel
You'll always have friends at the grand hotel",Grand Hotel

And all the dreams I had the night before came back
The faces that I'd seen looked so familiar

I know that wrong and right can sometimes look the same

I wish that I could show you the many things I've seen

I know the morning is wiser than the nighttime
I know there's nothing wrong, I shouldn't feel so down
So many things I know, but they don't help me

The sun comes shining in my eyes
The sun comes shining in my eyes
The sun comes shining in my eyes

Are closed now
Count the stars inside your mind
Count the breaths, count heartbeats
Count the sounds of life

And all the dreams I had the night before were gone
The faces that I'd seen looked so familiar
But I forgot them all when I saw the sun

Regina Spektor,"The sellers of flowers buy up old roses
They pull off dead petals, like old heads of lettuce
And sell 'em as new ones, for cheaper and fairer
But they die by the morning, so who is the winner

Not the roses, not the buyers, not the sellers, maybe winter

'Cause winters coming, soon after summer
It runs faster, faster, chasing off autumn
We go from a warm sun to only a white sun
We go from a large sun to only a small one

When I was a small girl, I walked through the market
Holding my dad's hand, mitten-gloved hand
That night there were roses, lit up in glass boxes
The heat lamps would keep them from freezing in winter

We never bought them but somebody must have
Maybe they made it or maybe they froze up
Before any person had put them in water
And hoped that they'd still be alive by the morning

Who's the winner
Not the roses, not the buyers, not the sellers,
Not the tellers, of the stories,
Not the fathers, not their children,
Not those walking on a dark night,
Through a memory they're forgetting,
Who's the winner, who's the winner
Maybe winter, maybe winter

Somebody steps on a light through a tunnel
They're holding a piece of their mind in the rubble
Hold on, I won't let go, I want to know

But no one lives long enough to see the outcome
To know any answers, to know what the point is
To know if the winter ever came closer
Than on that night when I walked with my father

A small piece of ice, lodged in my mind
Lodged in my thoughts, lodged in my eyes
Cold all around, cold all around
Warm from inside, warm from inside

Not the tellers, of the stories,

Regine,"Un tango argentin
Une valse musette
Je suis un peu pompette, j’arrête
Tant pis pour le bon vin
Qui me tourne la tête
Me voici je suis prête, je viens

Je viens danser dans vos bras dans vos mains
Je viens me donner, enlacez-moi les reins
Je suis à vous pour cet instant magique
A vous et à la musique
Je suis à vous pour cet instant magique
A vous et à la musique

Entraînez-moi encore
L’accordéon me guide
Et l’espace se vide, pour nous
Pacifique corps à corps
Quand nos corps se dérident
Quand on est plus timide, surtout

Je viens danser dans  vos bras dans vos mains
Je viens me donner, enlacez-moi les reins
Je suis à vous pour cet instant magique
A vous et à la musique
Je suis à vous pour cet instant magique
A vous et à la musique

Petit baloche, mon tendre bal musette
C’est grâce à toi que j’ai le cœur en fête
Et que je danse ce soir
Au-dessous des lampions
Et que je vibre pour ton accordéon

Sur la piste déserte
Je tourne et je balance
Et j’ai le corps en transe, pourtant
Je suis à vous refaire, pour un tango pareil
Un très grand soleil levant

Je viens danser dans vos bras dans vos mains
Je viens me donner, enlacez-moi les reins
Je suis à vous pour cet instant magique
A vous et à la musique
Je suis à vous pour cet instant magique

Regine Velasquez,"Come feel the power of the love
Release the power of the love

Comes a time when love is just another
And ain't no special thing
Becomes a crime when neither cares
No longer and kills like sinking sand

And what is there to offer
To make it all much better aside
From going all the way
To try a little harder
And make the hearts go fonder a
Little more than words can say

We just gotta keep on lovin'
We just gotta make it happen
Every minute hour of the day
Just the two of us together on
The wings of love we travel
Here we go up and away

Fly and feel the power
Of the love in one another
Fly release the power of the love that'll take us
Higher
Pa-ri-ya and feel
The power of the love

With hearts on cruise control

It's everything I am,
Everything I want to be;

Now I can take the time,

Regine Velasquez,"Long ago, and, oh so far away
I fell in love with you
Before the second show.
Your guitar, it sounds so sweet and clear,
But you're not really here.
It's just the radio.
Don't you remember you told me
You loved me baby?
You said you'd be coming back this way
Again baby.
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby.
I love you, I really do.
Loneliness is such a sad affair,
And I can hardly wait
To be with you again.
What to say, to make you come again?
Come back to me again,
And play your sad guitar.",Superstar
Regine Velasquez,"I guess you heard, I guess you know
In time I'd have told you, but I guess I'm too slow.
And it's overly romantic but I know that it's real
I hope you don't you mind if I say what I feel.
It's like I'm in somebody else's dream,
This could not be happening to me.
(Chorus)
But you were there, and you were everything I'd never seen.
You woke me up from this long and endless sleep.
I was alone.
I opened my eyes and you were there.
Don't be alarmed, no don't be concerned.
I don't want to change things
leave them just as they were.
I mean nothing's really different
It's me who feel strange.
I'm always lost for words when someone mentions your name.
I know I'll get over this for sure
I'm not the type who dreams there could be more.
(Chorus)
But you were there, and you were everything I'd never seen.
You woke me up from this long and endless sleep.
I was alone.
I opened my eyes and you were there.
Can I take your smile home with me,
or the magic in your hair?
The rain has stopped, the storm has passed
Look at all the colors now the sun's here at last.
I supposed that you'll be leaving but I want you to know
Part of you stays with me even after you go.
Like an actor playing someone else's scene
This could not be happening to me.
But you were there, and you were everything I'd never seen.
You woke me up from this long and empty sleep.
I was alone.
I opened my eyes and no, I'm not alone, I'm not alone.
I opened my eyes and you were there.",You Were There
Regine Velasquez,"Zoom just one look
And then my heart went boom
Suddenly and we were on the moon
Flying high in the neon sky, oh

Bang just one touch
And all the church bells rang
Heaven called and all the angels sang
Sunrise shine in the midnight sky, oh

Zoom you chase the day away
High noon the moon and stars came out to play
Then my whole wide world went zoom

(I passed a rainbow as we went flying by
Faster and faster we were higher than high
For once in my lifetime I was finally free
And you came back to me)

Oh, zoom you chase the day away
High noon the moon and stars came out to play
Then my whole wide world went zoom

Moonbeams dancing in the afternoon
Shadows blowing as the roses bloom
Looking down on a wonderland, oh

Smack just one kiss
And I was outta whack
All at once there was no turning back
Oh so far above the brightest star, oh

And stars came out to play",Zoom

And I don't know why
I'm jealous of the people who
Are not afraid to die
It's just that I recall
Back when I was small
Someone promised that they'd catch
But then they'd let me fall

And now I'm fallin'
Fallin' fast again
Why do I always take a fall
When I fall in love

You think, by now I've learned
Play with fire, you'd get burned
But fire can be oh so warm
And that's why I return
Turn and walk away
That's what I should do
My head says go and find the door
My heart says I'll find you

And now I'm fallin'
Catch me if you can
Maybe this time I'll have it all

Now it seems years
I'm back in the city
Where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you,
Bringing us near

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

Time in New England
Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

I feel the change comin'
I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out
All the love that I have
With you there's a heaven,
So earth ain't so bad

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you

And laugh while you're bleeding
But she'll bring out the best
And the worst you can be
Blame it all on yourself
'Cause she's always a woman to me

Oh she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh and she never gives out
And she never gives in
She just changes her mind

She is frequently kind
And then suddenly cruel
She can do as she pleases
She's nobody's fool
And she can't be convicted
She earned her degree
And the most she will do
Is throw shadows at you
But she's always a woman to me",She's Always a Woman
Regis Philbin,"Give me a kiss to build on and my imagination will thrive upon that kiss
Sweetheart I ask no more than this, a kiss to build a dream on
 
Give me a kiss before you leave me and my 
Imagination will feed my hungry heart
Leave me one thing before we part, a kiss to build a dream on
When I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you 
Weaving romances, making believe they're true

Imagination will make that moment live

Regis Philbin,"A long time ago 
A million years BC 
The best things in life 
Were absolutely free. 

But no one appreciated 
A sky that was always blue. 
And no one congratulated 
A moon that was always new. 

So it was planned that they would vanish now and them 
And you must pay before you get them back again. 
That's what storms were made for 
And you shouldn't be afraid for 

Every time it rains it rains 
Pennies from heaven. 
Don't you know each cloud contains 
Pennies from heaven. 

You'll find yor fortune falling 
All over town. 
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down. 
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers. 

If you want the things you love 
You must have showers. 
So when you hear it thunder 
Don't run under a tree. 

There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me.",Pennies from Heaven
Regis Philbin,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When

You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You

I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.

I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low

How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Cubriendo el asfalto en mi doble rodado

Cuando llegue al cruce mis plebes brincaron
Bonito los contras tentaron al diablo

De amor pero si me besas algo presiento aquí
Por dentro detonar mi corazón tus labios tienen
La pólvora tu estilo especial cuando me abrasas

Me des-fragmento de paso activas un sentimiento
Y al instante una explosión por dentro por que
Me pones a temblar perdóname nuevamente la enfermedad
Te contagiaste del virus ántrax y los corridos también

Te encantan también te enfermas y te arremangas
Y eso me hace quererte mas y cuando me lanzas
Una mirada con el poder de convencimiento
Esas miradas son mas certeras que el r-quince que traen

Los hombres del macho prieto ráfagas de besos
Me has disparado no los detienen ni con blindados
Tus uñas son filosas mas peligrosas mas tenebrosas
Que el cuchillo que trae el ondeado tus labios

Tienen la pólvora un estilo especial cuando
Me abrasas me des-fragmento de paso activas
Un sentimiento y al instante una explosión
Por dentro por que me pones a temblar

Y las fajas atrincadas
Te la tiras de la reina
Y la gran diva no presumas perfección
Yo te he visto desarmada

Ya ahora si a olvidar se ha dicho
Voy a arremangar macizo
Voy a darme buenos gustos
Porque tú ya no vas a ser mi capricho
La verdad tú no la cuajas
Para mejorar mi raza
Y para tu mala suerte

Regulo Caro,"Ya coronamos chavalos
Vayan pensando
En que grupo jalo
Porque viene mi cumpleaños
Y quiero enfiestarme un rato

Me da pa' arriba macizo
La banda en vivo
Y las guitarras
Echándome unas heladas
Se me antojo irme pal sitio

Y soy de carrera larga
No cualquiera me desbanca
Cuando ya traigo la viada
Y arriba de un buen caballo
Traigan La Séptima Banda
Que quiero bailar mi cuaco

Y échele Fredy, 
Porque juntos podemos lograr grandes cosas, así 
O mas claro compa Regulo Caro
Ajay, y puro Enigma Norteño hay otro?

No me gusta ser manguera
Pero tampoco

Soy un cualquiera
Por ahi dicen
""que lo bueno sale caro""
Gracias a Dios hay manera

Ando entre la calentura
De eso no hay duda
Pero me gusta
Andar entre el refuego
Porque la vida es muy cortita
Y solo hay una

Como la ve mi compadre
Dicen que somos artistas
Porque nos gusta el desmadre
Y si andamos de gira
Es porque el trabajo lo requiere

Regulo Caro,"Caminito de la sierra
Que bajas curveando cuestas
Me han bajado de tu tierra
A punta de metralletas
En donde estaba sembrando
La cosecha que más cuesta

El gobierno volar, puede
Nosotros pues, caminamos
Pero si bajan tantito
En el suelo lo esperamos
Ya cuando estemos parejos
Aquí sí nos la rifamos

No es que fuera malo el hombre
Ni tampoco su ayudante
Mal consejera es el hambre
Hay que tenerlo presente
Se olvidan buenas costumbres
Con gobiernos prepotentes

El mar es un buche de agua
Si te andas rifando el cuero
Por eso bajo a los ranchos
A pasearme con dinero
Con música y con mujeres
Para olvidar este infierno

Y buscando un mejor rango
Lo mismo que en los partidos
Allá se ganan gritando
Aquí se ganan con tiros
Por eso buscando plata
Me vine a sembrar con Lino

Fast it's like I got a cracker up my ass
Crass educated middle middle class
Half caste one of a critical mass
Broke the old mold smashed the last cast
If you ask me don't believe the hype of the past
'cause political ties are never built to last
Seems like a motherfucker want a capitalize
Parasites on the rise with greed in their eyes
I criticise only when you fuckers despise
Lives take a dive when your dirty profits are high
Good grief could we see some debt relief
Or can you stand to watch another fucker spending belief
Fuck sake all you do is take n take n take
Maybe it's time to cut a break
I got the pantene sheen with with the colgate gleam
I mean shit.. they told me I was worth it.. legit that's all I need
I'm free to rot my teeth with coca co I utilise
The phenylalanic flow to tap the toe and rock it
Live I survive by the means I deploy
Laugh in the face of the void.. prozac.. enjoy
We're on top with the same sweatshop enterprise
We're big macking keep the fries on the side
'cause I'm like n.i.k.e get the fat free
One hell of a pimp almost get it for free
Wrappin job skills up with the childcare too
If you're poor and underage we'll come and see you
'cause I'm logo largin crash card chargin
A hard entourage for the cultural barge
Mmm.. yeah that's the sound
Roll the red rugs out 'cause we're coming round
You can listen to the mithanthric shit I be given
But I can't be guaranteein take it or leave it
Call me a hyppocrit for this I know I can't be forgiven
By product of the ego.. nomic life I be livin
I'd be fucking with you if I said I knew what to do
But before you get to swallow just remember to chew
And if it tastes like shit then spit it out.. out out out
Murdoctered that's beyond a doubt
'cause none of what you hear and even less what you're seein
Comes even close to any version of the truth worth believing
It's just a bland scam stamped with the master brand
Lambs to the slaughter
Only 'cause you do what you oughta
But if your plan is to take what you can
Watch where you stand
Hand bights the clan - fear fights on demand
And if you understand evil could be good mistook
You gotta get the fuck up and take a look...

Keep it to the lest

Stand real tall in my bullet proof vest

Show your fuckin face and you can listen to the drum

Why've I got the mike when I don't know what to do
Maybe I can pass it on to you and you can kill me

Thank you all for coming to get absolutely fucked
Apologies to anyone who's sober in the club
I ain't high and it sounds pretty bad
Hope it sounds better on the drugs you had
Rockin it is kinda like a wharf-on-exhaust (?)
Things will happen quicker if you circumvent the lowest
Put your hands in the air, step away from the mike

Walk around the earth stressed

Rehab,"I am the everything, the all-knowing, the omnipotent one
I watch the fields, I do not feel, I circumnavigate everyone
I am the scarecrow, alone and disconnected
You stare right past me undetected
I am only here when you expect it
Nowhere man, I live invisible and feel a sadness undescribable
I hang here motionless holding a bible, no revival
I died and became apathy, then married vacancy
Then moved my children to the tundra of complacency
I do not exist in your world
I've burned the bridges, I have cut the life line
Now all I have left is my mind
Which judges all of you, analyzes all your dumb philosophies
In wonderment of how you all have ruined your ecology
Yet you do not hear for I am to you only but nothingness
And I can't understand why I'm the only one that feels like this
It's all piss, I flee, out of all the people that have left me
The one I miss most is me

I am the scarecrow
And I am so alone

And I've seen thirty years of down time
The face of a clown, a stick for a spine
From a grandiose small town mind and crows fly all around mine
They shit on my shoulder, I got no voice, no mobility
I get older, heated but colder
No yield in my field, fuck my opinion
I stare at your houses in the distance
Silent persistence, at night your windows glisten
I got nothing to say cause no one would listen anyway
So I remain against the grain, I've seen sunny days with rain
Busted knuckles in pain and never complained
Dirt is my domain, my view is plain
But I'm invisible, sounds mystical
Not really, the days are dry, the evening chilly
The only person that understands is little Billy when he's lonely
Let me feel something, make me worth a damn
Make me new again, make me a fuckin' man
I've seen the rise and fall, the come and go
The high and low, and if you knew what I know
Sometimes one does not reap what he sews
The wind blows, the moon glows, the water flows
The rain turns to snow and the ground is froze
And only God knows why that's the way it goes

I am the scarecrow
And I am so alone
I'm so alone

I am the scarecrow
And I am so alone
I'm so alone, so alone, I am so alone, so alone",Scarecrow
Rehab,"And breathin's overrated
Storm chasin and its gettin later
I used to love her now I hate her she's a brain raider
Fallin in a crater
Of lost memories
I'm so out of hand
I don't even fuck with me
I'm goin trippin drunk and slippin
Sleepin in ditches
Switchin prescriptions
Bangin a random hoe and itchin
I don't give a flyin feces
I ain't one with the human species
Slappin the nurse tryin to up my cc's
I fall apart
Take all my pain turn it into art
Blowin up a K-Mart and blame it all on Mozart
Fuck I'm surprised I got a deal
Every two hours I take a pill
That's where I'm at,
Its all surreal
I got imaginary friends
An imaginary life
An imaginary wife
And a real knife
Out of here by next weekend
Hung over on the dresser with my brain leakin
And I run away
From the light of day
I am not okay
My soul's a misery
I think I'm losin my mind
I'm whacked out on jack and blacked out
Trapped in a crack house full of doubt
I got guilt to the hilt
I fight tears and fears
Been out for ten years
Hit a big bump up off the mirror
Find me at www dot
I came to trouble you dot
Come here mothafucka take your best shot
Suicidal
Got a lot of demons to fight
I'll probably sit in a chair and put my mouth around a rifle
I feel abused to lose the blues
I'll bring my booze
I'm in the who's who's
And dope fees and floozies in the land
Preparin for news
These niggas are never choosy
The morning sun is like a sledgehammer to my forehead
And I'm barely here
Look in the mirror every day and slowly disappear
Been through a million and 67 emotions in my short career
Riddles I fear
Staggered out in the street for beer awww fuck it
And I run away
From the light of day
I am not okay
My soul's a misery
My heartbeat is racin
Even though I'm standin still I can't stop storm chasin
I stole a shell casing
So close to overdose that night the day hurts my eyes
Wishin my death to be a surprise
My life should be more
Than four walls and a floor
But that's all that is mine
God give me a sign
'Cause I'm tryin and dyin at the same time
I'm not hesitatin
Just waitin
Heck yeah comin with a flurry
And like the spice up in you throat
I get ya chokin like that curry
Somethin bout the police and them lights that get me worried
Made a lap up on that bastard in a hurry
Flyin from the spirits so I got a story
The dude that taught me how to rap was Ray Murray
Its all a can still its filled with no glory
Top the killer red out at 2:30
And I run away
From the light of day
I am not okay

To cover the memory of someone I thought I'd always need
Cover her name with a smoking gun
Make it hurt as much as possible and make it bleed

Just can't take it no more feelin' numb
Woke up face on the floor I was dumb
Cut me all the way to the core morning comes
Time to get busy forgetting again
Tired of going out my mind
Looking for something I won't find
How could I have been so blind

Left a note sayin' she won't hang on, she just can't fight
I know she's with Brock Scott, that jock with blonde locks
That blocks shots, guess I'm just not that hot

Let him bust your rear cuz you don't trust my rap career

Heart still wearing a stain I'm to blame

Now he was just your average everyday traffic jam competitor
With half a gram, walkin' in the club tryin' to set it off
She had two silicon weapons of mass distraction
Nipples like screw-in cleats, damn near blastin'
Through her skin tight blouse, she lookin' for some action
Said her hubby was out of town and started askin'
If he'd like to go to her house.
I think that's when he realized he couldn't do it
Looked at her finger, a diamond from her ring
Hit his eye, he couldn't linger
He started feelin' guilty for everything they were up to
He took a deep breath said, ""you know what, I'd love to
But evidently there is already someone who loves you""
She looked at him like he insulted her and said, ""fuck you
Look at your pupils, I know what that stuff do
Mr. Goody Twoshoes, Call me out, I'll call you out too.""
Now he was weak as her, he had a ring too.

Together in their deceitful ways embracing the lust
They got carried away like a dog chasin' a bus
They were back at her house in another man's bed
And gettin 'freaky deaky' while the husband sped home
To see his wife cause his job had got done early
Meanwhile they're wreckin' the room
And talkin' all dirty, and sweaty
The hubby stopped and got some flowers so pretty
And a bottle of wine to spend some time with his sweetie
Gets home, sees a car in the yard and he's thinkin' hmmm?
Walks up the driveway opens the door and goes numb
Just about the time he's gonna yell ""honey I'm home""
A trail of clothes down the hall leading to passionate moans
Changed his tone, tip-toed to the gun cabinet
Grabbed a gun his daddy gave him that he used in Vietnam
Walk down the hall kicked in the door said ""surprise""
Sat down on the bed with guns and roses and wine

Just walk away, just walk away
There's too much wrong for you to stay
Just walk away, Just walk away
Gonna get yourself in trouble, walk away

Hubby said ""how you two love birds doing? You havin' fun?
Don't cover up your nakedness now, What's done's done""
He made his wife call her parents
Made the dude call his wife and daughter
And told them to come over, ""let's talk about life""
And then hubby called the preacher 'cause you want God involved
When the victim of infidelity has got a revolver
and the guests straggled into the room one at a time
Realizing what was happening and then wishing they were blind
He told the preacher who had married them back in the day
That he was right 'the lord works in mysterious ways'
Then he addressed the room waving the gun carefree
Saying ""ladies and gentlemen you've been called here to see
Two naked embarrassed humans in a bed that I bought
They were havin' great sex about the time they got caught""
Then he laid the gun down on the bed so relaxed
And said ""I'm leaving' feel free to shoot me in the back""

I'm caught up in the zeros and ones
Heroes are none, egos and guns
What the hell are we doing it for
Wars and rumors of war, ignore the poor
Saw a billboard with 1-800-DIVORCE
Of course I just let it happen let someone else die for freedom
The devil's playing a game and only God can beat him
And the only time that I seem to pray is when I need him
And I'm feeling like a sorry sack of snake semen
Feeling edgy and fidgety in this digital gadgetdy
Sick, tragedy stricken kick in the dick, called ""Earth""
But did you care that the Frigidaire's bare
That you couldn't get a beer there
Life is a carnival but it ain't fair
Where where tell me where where
Can I learn to smile again
All I can do is stare at all the stupid people frolicking
Around downtown 'round 'bout now
I'm looking for someone to give me the truth
But lies are all I found

And we've yet to witness the cost of our greed
Just a child with a smile and a wide open mouth
And his tongue hanging out, thirsty for heaven
That raindrop's coming down somewhere right now
And a beautiful future has been diluted, polluted
My father saw the flag, he she'd a tear and saluted
When I was young he said the world was in trouble, I knew it
I find the news to confusing killing the gin
I'm into the wind, three sheets and I feel under the gun
With a lung full ganja they want you to wonder
Aimlessly, nameless, brainless
Insane as it sounds is insane as I feel
What is real Got a zillion ideas Is I'm ill
This is weird all the fashion trends, thieves are cashing in
We've been deceived knee deep in dung and disease

And I'm searching trying to set one free
The one silver dollar that means everything

It's like a '82 Regal on blocks in a field
Dip it in some paint, drop it on some wheels
And I'm searchin for a feeling I had
Once upon a time when it wasn't so bad

Ooh, when it wasn't so bad
Ooh, when it wasn't so bad yeah

We would watch the sun come up after a long night, 
Everything you need to make you feel like wrong's right. (Ah yeah! )

Blazin, raisin' cane at the Days Inn.
Room 221, gettin it done.
Goin out our minds for a good time.
We were high like H.I., livin life on the run. (Ah Yeah! )

Spendin my money like else mattered, 
When the Folks rolled by, everbody scattered.
It was dirty, it was seedy, it was grimy, it was gritty.
They was stripping, they was strappin, they were trippin, they were trappin. (Ah Yeah! )

There's a Waho by the Hoti when they sang that moto.
And if you drive through you don't want to go solo. (Ah Yeah! )

The sink and the bathtub both full of beer, 
There were empty cigarette packs everywhere.
People coming, people going, everybody's celly ringing.
Ain't nobody sleeping till you hear the birds singing. (Ah Yeah! )

Taking everything that you could think of to the head, 
Just lettin off steam, someone poppin off lead.
And the honeys made their money with the oldest know profession, 
Unless you were holdin cause they all were on a mission. (Ah Yeah! )

We were ready to fight at the drop of a dime, 
Didn't never check the clock, wasn't worried 'bout the time.

Yeah we were living for the moment, if they had it we was on it.
Getting drunk and staying drunk until the morning, talkin junk.
And lookin homeless, it was just a place your momma told you not to go, 
The kinda spot you locked and loaded if your smart(Ah Yeah! )but if you're not.

You're like I was when I was there, stupid, but the rooms were cheap, 
Food is inexpensive, gettin geek until we went to sleep.
Better hope you get a bed cause those were sure some dirty floors, 
Had to look through the peephole when people knocked the doors. (Ah Yeah! )

Reid Genauer,"I love you more than all the singers in a motown group
The way you watch me watching you out
On the front porch stoop
The radio loaded with the voice of a god
I got this guitar and the faded facade

Alabama was the place where I had narrowly cracked
I kicked the hotel door down and so I couldn't go back
Telephone wires and these old strings will rust
Besides my guitar it's you alone I trust

Such a lovely vision when I left my eyes looking at you

I'm a junkie for your lovin' your adrift in my veins
You travel through all of my spaces and you swallow my brain
Dance on my skin - sleep in my head
I float my guitar then I swim in your bed
Such a lovely vision when I left my eyes looking at you

I know you now me. I know you like the taste of my tongue
Like dancing branches we mingled in the yesterday sun
Deep water eyes spin me around
Stuck in your gaze such a sweet place to drown

Such a lovely vision",Love Junkie
Reign,"I had some problems and no one could seem to solve them.
But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.
All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

As the sun has its place up in the sky,
I love you so dearly,
And all the same there's no need to wonder why.
I need you, please hear me.

Say you really love me, darlin';

Reign of Kindo,"Snow in the air, as it rides the winter breeze
Crystals of ice are hanging from the trees
The morning of Christmas has arrived in its due time
The children are waiting, their joy becomes mine

We march down the stairs and into the other room
The lights shining bright on the tree for all to view
The window is shattered and the presents are all gone
And the cries of my children wrote this song

I swear, when I get my hands on him
He'll never breathe again.
I won't stop tearing him limb from limb
He'll never breathe again.

I get in my car to chase the only set of tracks
A gun in my hand and a bag in the back
Deep in the slums, I saw him with their toys

My gunshot rang out,
But the snow absorbed the noise.
I bagged up his body and I threw it in the car
With all the toys that he'd carried oh so far

Now that I've got my hands on him,
I can breathe again
Finally, I've rid the world of him and
I can breathe again

Back at the house all my children were so sad
But when their presents return, then not but joy,
They'll surely have
I drove to the river and I threw the body in
No one else will be paying for his sin

Something screaming inside me
Says that I can breathe again
Judge me all that your hearts desire,
But I can breathe again.",Breathe Again
Reign of Kindo,"The moments in between the words I hear you speak
Are desolate and clean and leave me feeling weak
I just want to see the beautiful world in my dreams
But all I see is me in the center of all I seek

Now I feel like a ghost in a world that is fading
All I've been taught to recall simply fails to persuade me
The truth tends to sting while it heals
And the only way back is screaming the words

Oh my God what have I become?
I feel this fire burn
Burn till I'm undone and never to return

I remember when the wind brought heaven's scent
And the stars that filled the sky
Drew a line between you and I

Oh my God what have I become?
I feel this fire burn
Burn till I'm undone and never to return

Lift up your voice loud
I declare myself this hour
Simply dust that's entrusted with such a peculiar power

Oh my God what have I become?
I feel this fire burn
Burn 'till I'm undone, never to return

There's nothing like living, asleep in some hazy dream
Then your eyes open to see what they've never seen
Oh the first time that my gaze fell upon this place
How I shudder to think what I've become",The Moments in Between
Reign of Kindo,"There comes a time
When you make up your mind
Of where to lay your lonely roots down
And I've been travelin' so far and wide
Seen the deepest depths and heights beyond high
So I'm surprised to see you with my eyes
With my mind's best dreams and left your face so incomplete

It's nice to meet you
Nice to meet you
Nice to meet you
It's nice to meet you
Nice to meet you
Nice to meet you

I know the day that I chased you away
When the words I spoke, were terribly wrong
And I confess that I made quite the mess
But it's just too late, and now you've moved on

Take me back to the days of the sun
Brightly shining down on the two of us
You used to lie I staring into the sky
Leaving every toil, and worry so far behind us

It's nice to meet you
Nice to meet you
It's nice to meet you
Nice to meet you
Nice to meet you

So now I pack my bags again
After all this time we've spent
To walk the earth without you by my side
All the fields and hills I've roamed
Have never felt like home
And how I wish that you'd never left
But it's just too late now",Nice to Meet You

Reik,"De que sirve lo que me rodea
Aunque tenga todo
Siento un vacio sin ti
De que me sirve el aire que respiro
Aunque sobrevivo siento que me ahogo sin ti

Hoy solo tengo tiempo
Why mi soledad para recordar
Solo me quedan fuerzas
Para soñar que tu volveras

Por que todo me falta
No me alcanzan las ganas de vivir
Aunque todo lo intento yo no entiendo
Por que no estas aqui

Aunuqe nada es eterno o perfecto
Tu lo eres para mi
Te necesito por que sin ti no sé vivir

De que me sirve ver un nuevo dia
Si no hay alegria
Solo quedan ganas de huir
De que me sirve el reflejo de la luna
Why tener una fortuna
Si el amor se ha ido de aqui

Hoy solo tengo tiempo
Why mi soledad para recordar
Solo me quedan fuerzas
Para soñar que tu volveras

Por que todo me falta
No me alcanzan las ganas de vivir
Aunque todo lo intento yo no entiendo
Por que no estas aqui

Aunuqe nada es eterno o perfecto

Te necesito por que sin ti
Te necesito por que sin ti
Te necesito por que sin ti no sé vivir

Mientras tú y yo nos refugiamos en la eternidad
No siento frío cerca de ti
Dentro de mí brilla el sol

Se cae el cielo y que más da
Tenemos nuestro mundo
El día sigue siendo azul
Si estamos juntos

No importa nada mas que aquí
Jamás será invierno, invierno
Tanto ruido tanta soledad gente que corre sin parar
Tras la puerta ese universo de infinita paz
Necesito la calma que tú me das

Se cae el cielo y que más da
Tenemos nuestro mundo
El día sigue siendo azul
Si estamos juntos
No importa nada más que lo que tú me das

Nubes viento miedo lluvia
Noches grises ni una
Luna por tu invierno de oscuridad
Tú me besas tú me curas
Tu calor y tu ternura
No lo dejan entrar invierno, invierno, invierno

Se cae el cielo y que más da
Tenemos nuestro mundo

Aquí jamás será invierno, invierno

Aunque trate de olvidar, quien decide es el amor. 
Aunque hay alas en mi alma why mil caminos en mi piel, 
Aunque mande la razon, quien decide es el amor. 

Talvez yo me di cuenta demasiado tarde, 
Estoy ya rendido a la fuerza de tus ojos, 
Sera que tu cuerpo conoce, 
Las leyes del día why la noche, 
Que me tienen tan perdido. 

Yo no se luchar con mis propios sentimientos 
Why yo no se jugar cuando estoy contigo... 

Aunque quiera escaparme why no sentir mi corazon, 
Aunque trate de olvidar, quien decide es el amor.

Dejando un abismo entre tu y yo
No te he podido olvidar, no se si a ti 
Te pase lo mismo

Toda mi vida cambio
Me falta tu amor
Siento que pierdo la razón
y hoy te he vuelto a llorar
Por que sin ti no aprendo a vivir

Vuelve quiero sentirme en tus brazos
Quiero besarte los labios
Por siempre quedarme a tu lado
Vuelve sabes que tu me haces falta
La espera es cruel y lastima
Vuele llena de amor mi vida

Como sacarme este amor
Que ahora es dolor
Tal vez olvidarte sea mejor
Pero no puedo engañar
A este corazón que espera por ti

Vuelve quiero sentirme en tus brazos
Quiero besarte los labios
Por siempre quedarme a tu lado
Vuelve sabes que tu me haces falta

Reik,"Me despierto en la mañana, para verte pasar
Y tenerte en mi mente por el resto del día
Que vida, la mía
Aun no se tu nombre y ya eres dueña de mi 
Y me paso todo el día imaginando tu risa
Que vida, la mía

No se que hacer, para ser el aire que va a tu alrededor
Y acaricia tu piel

Solo quiero conversar, solo quiero conocerte
Dame un poco de tu tiempo para convencerte
Yo solo quiero ser tu amigo, y me muero por salir contigo
Dame una señal, solo dame una mirada
Si tu estas a mi lado, a mi no me importa nada
Ya quiero estar entre tus brazos
Y me muero por probar tus labios 
Rojos, llenos de ti solo dime que si

Me desvelo en las noches para pensar en ti
Y si duermo solo sueño con tener tus caricias
Que vida, la mía
Tengo todo este amor y solo es para ti 
Y yo solo me conformo con mirarte otro día

Me pongo a temblar,
Why no tengo que aparentar.

Pues lo que me haces sentir,
Después de mirar hacia atrás,
Es real.

Juntos al caminar,
No tengo temor,
Lo que la vida nos de.

Porque sé,
Que eres tú,
Quien me hare decir:

No hare falta más,
Que tu voz,
Tu mirar.

Me basta con saber
Que estarás aquí
Un día más, más, más (Na ra na na)
Un días más.

why todas las cosas que,
Sufrimos los dos,
Me hacen amarte aún más (auahhh).

why quiero pasar así,
Toda la vida,
Sentirme loco por tí.

Que eres tú,

No hare falta más,
Que tu voz,

Llega el fantasma de tu voz
Diciéndome
Ya no llores amor

Soy un eslabón

Fui fuego por ti
Hoy sólo quedan las cenizas

Reik,"Era tan bella, era tan bella
Que su mirada todavia me quema
Como quisiera poderla olvidar
Pero se acerca y no lo puedo evitar

Por que cuando habla con sus ojos
Dice cosas que no puedo entender
y se desnuda poco a poco
y se convierte en tu piel

y yo no se como vivir
Si ya no puedo sacarla de aqui
Que no daria por besarla
Por abrazarla una vez mas

y ya no quiero dejarla escapar
Si es que la puedo volver a encontrar
No puedo perderla, por que solo es ella
Inolvidable para mi corazon
Inolvidable

Fue como un cuento
Se fue como el viento
A veces me digo
Que talvez me lo invento

Si al menos pudiera
Tener una prueba,
Algun recuerdo de que estuve con ella

Me estoy volviendo loco un poco
Aveces me despierto
y siento aqui mi pena
Que me susurra en el oido
y dice donde estas amor

y yo no se como vivir
Si ya no puedo sacarla de aqui
Que no daria por besarla
Por abrazarla una vez mas
y ya no quiero dejarla escapar

Si es que la puedo volver a encontrar
No puedo perderla, por que solo es ella

Reik,"Ayer
No me preocupaba nada
Y en sus brazos descansaba
Como la imaginan
Se fue
Sin decirme una palabra
Para que sirvió decirle tantas veces
Que la amaba
Se fue con ella el aire y la luz
Mis ganas de amar
Y es que ya no puedo más

Porque siempre me pierdo
Con tu recuerdo
Sabe más frío

No sentir dolor
Obligarme a perder tu calor,

Porque muero por dentro
Finjo y me miento
Desaparezco por ti
Y el dolor
No desaparecerá

Porque...eh perdido esta batalla
Donde solo yo luchaba
Fui un ciego y nada más
Tal vez
Con el tiempo las heridas
Que dejaste en mi vida
Y que marcaste en mi alma

Se fue con ella el aire y la luz

Que por tu amor estoy sufriendo de veras

A ciegas, perdido

Duele ver que tu futuro
No combina, conmigo
Y no quiere comprender mi corazón

Para que fingir
Si sabes como yo
Que este sueño terminó
Somos fuego que se enfrió

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

How am I supposed to leave
When I can't even move
In the time it would've took to say
?Honey I'm home, how was your day'
You dropped a bomb right where we live
And expected me to just forgive?

Well, that's a mighty big word
For such a small man
And I'm not sure I can
?Cause I don't even know now who I am
And it's too soon for me to say forgive

I guess I should ask but I won't
Was it love of just her touch
?Cause I don't think I want to know
So get you some things and get out
Don't call me for a day or two
So I can sort this out
Well you might as well've ripped the life
Right out of me right here tonight

?Can you ever just forgive?'

Reinhard Mey,"Ich liebe getragene Melodien, 
Zarte Zwischentne, klare Harmonien. 
Lulu liebt Rock, und Lulu liebt Roll, 
Lulu schert sich gar nicht ums Protokoll. 
Lulu mag es laut, und ich eher leis, 
Ich mag es cool, und sie eher hei. 
Lulu liebt's wild und Lulu liebt's schrill, 
Also mag ich es halt so wie Lulu es will! 

Lulu liebt Bsse die knacken und knarr'n, 
Lulu liebe zweistimmige Booster Gitarr'n. 
Und ein gut abgehangenes Saxophon, 
Lulu liebt die Schiebudenexplosion. 
Lulu Taifun und Lulu Vesuv. 
Lulu liebt Drive und den guten Groove. 
Und ich liebe Lulu, und wenn sie micht liebt, 
Liebe ich alles das was Lulu liebt! 

Ich bin ein ruhiges, gutmtges Schaf. 
Ich liebe des nachts meine acht Stunden Schlaf. 
Lulu schlft nie, und beim 12. Schlag 
Macht sie mich munter und die Nacht zum Tag. 
Lulu macht micht fertig, Lulu macht mich fix, 
Lulu macht den Br'n los, Lulu kennt nix. 
Lulu will Action, ob es dmmert oder tagt, 
Und wenn Lulu Action will, dann ist Action angesagt! 

Lulu liebt Bsse die knacken

Ich tanz' wie eine Bratwurst, das ist wahr, 
Und nur bei Strafandrohung oder Lebensgefahr. 
Lulu tanzt wie ein Ball, Lulu treibt's bunt, 
Lulu tanzt auf dem Tisch mit einer Rose im Mund. 
Lulu tanzt ohne Schuhe und mit Leidenschaft, 
Lulu setzt das Schwerkraftgesetz auer Kraft. 
Lulu tanzt mit mir, und dann rieselt der Rost, 
Und dann schwanken die Planken, und ab geht die Post! 

Lulu liebt Bsse die knacken",Lulu

Gave me Dinah;

Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her!

With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Nearer your heart?

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Challengers caliber mediocre enter the catheter

On Primo beats, meditate a bit to elevate my spit
Scribble daily scripts, hell in wit
Angels I strangle the instrument mangle chop can't go pop
I gotta remain boom bap, true dat, who dat be?

Fate appear to backtrack where the plaques at?
Where the love for the cat?
Fortified flow, fire from fire like fame
Foresayer in Josiah desire to perspire
The 25th hour upon me, calmly walk the wire
Annihilate enemy ire any higher than I are in the sky
Or heaven I require less than mediocre
I reawoken the deeper thoughts of sleepin prophets
Regardless of others offers I authentic dialect, I'm a vet

Spit a rhyme saber like

Any beats sent to me I'mma instantly write
'til the fingertips crippled
It'll be sort of arthritis to finish a line

You ever chant with the rebels, dance with the devils?
Answered the higher levels, ride with the iron elbow to elbow
In hellish circles where the heat is echoed
You ever let go, stresses from pressures boilin beyond the kettle?
You ever petrified, exorcised demons
Believing you leave 'em breathin they'll get even
Odds are beyond y'all, achievin peaceful means of seekin deacons
Ain't no way out, they 'bout beat, by any means
Ain't necessary but they bury them very young, hell or heaven
Them adolescents, is pedalin, packin metal and settlin
Street wars, revolves life behind tight walls
When I falls, psychos strike the right chords

Tendre la main et faire l'aumône
Avec un air à mon grand-père
Garder la foi était lprincipe du père de ma mère
Petit clin d'oeil pour ne pas perdre le Nord
J'écris pour ne pas oublier, tous les pleurs de lAfrique du Nord,
Sud, Est, Ouest
Mais relevez tous la tête
N'oublions pas le Rwanda, ce génocide à coups de machettes
Trop lourde est la peine
Vous comprendre c'est difficile mais plus facile quand on vous aime
Mais que dire de plus, que la vie n'est qu'une épreuve
Que ce n'est pas une fin en soi
De finir veuf ou même veuve
Que la vie continue, que j'ai vu l'jour étant nu
Que ma mise en terre, d'un simple linceul je s'rai vêtu
Mais essuyez vos larmes, la vie vaut d'être vécue
Cet ignorant, lui, s'est pendu parce que sa femme le fait cocu
Message d'espoir, parait-il qu'on n'a plus le droit
Ni d'avoir faim, ni d'avoir froid
Mais ceci est une autre histoire.

Gardez la pêche le temps d'un titre quelques rimes pour ceux qui souffrent
On garde l'espoir pour ceux qui doutent, un brin de soleil pour ceux qui luttent
On sait que c'est dur mais on y croit, cette vie nous flingue mais on luttera
Faut rester forts tant qu'on a l'âge, il faut se battre tant qu'on est braves.

Vivre d'amour et d'eau fraîche, la citation qui me fait rire
L'incitation nous fait périr, la joie des autres me fait sourire
Le monde entier est rempli de mômes, de pauvreté et d'hématomes
Gardez l'espoir qu'un jour ça change, en terres d'Afrique ou en Thaïlande
Toi, petit homme qui n'y croit plus, qui a déjà baissé les bras
Impuissant tu te sens seul, mais sache que Dieu est avec toi
C'est un message d'encouragement car l'existence est loin d'être simple
Juste pour vous dire qu'on pense à vous, que tous ensemble on pourra vaincre
Enfants des favelas, partis trop tôt d'une balle perdue, d'un enlèvement ou orphelin, traînants
trop tard dans toutes ces rues
Toutes mes prières je vous dédie en espérant vous voir heureux
La cruauté de tous ces hommes sera punie, soyez-en sûrs
Malgré tout ça, y a de belles choses, cherchez les bien car elles se cachent
Le coeur d'un être a des richesses même si des fois cette vie est trash
En tout cas, je reste optimiste parce que sinon je perds le moral
S'il vous plaît, gardez la foi même si c'est dur sous des pluies de balles


Gardez la pêche le temps d'un titre quelques rimes pour ceux qui souffrent
On garde l'espoir pour ceux qui doutent, un brin de soleil pour ceux qui luttent
On sait que c'est dur mais on y croit, cette vie nous flingue mais on luttera
Faut rester forts tant qu'on a l'âge, il faut se battre tant qu'on est braves.

Garde la pêche sous ce ciel nuageux
Garde l'espoir de revoir le ciel étoilé un jour briller sous tes yeux
Sois honnête et fais honneur à tes vieux
Reste humble et fort, et des valeurs sois le plus respectueux
Dis-toi que le monde abrite ta chance aux plus profonds d'une mine d'or
Creuse un jour où l'autre et t'en apercevras le trésor
Lève-toi et va de l'avant et n'attend pas que le vent t'emporte
Face aux succès et à la chance et n'attend pas qu'il te rapporte
Les clefs de la réussite
Là où se perd le mérite
Là où les gens héritent de la haine deviennent individualiste
Alors si t'as le sentiment que ton corps agonise
Dis-toi que chaque être humain et promis à une terre quelque soient les
Erreurs commises
J't'avoue que c'est dur d'être courageux quand le ciel bleu devient orageux
Et que les gens qui soi-disant t'aiment deviennent dangereux pour des enjeux
Et malgré tout ce qui t'entoure, faut rester sage
Après l'orage vient le beau temps, après la peur vient le courage

Gardez la pêche le temps d'un titre quelques rimes pour ceux qui souffrent
On garde l'espoir pour ceux qui doutent, un brin de soleil pour ceux qui luttent

Une chance sur 2 de finir pompiste
Parce que t'habites dans le 95 et que ton blaze est sur la liste
Toi t'es blonde tu t'appelles Claire
Le problème c'est que tu es ronde
Pour être hôtesse d'accueil dans ce système
Aujourd'hui faut être une bombe
Toi, c'est Yassine, t'as 22 ans
Tout frais, beau gosse, sorti des cours
En chaise roulante depuis tout jeune voilà le frein à ton parcours
Tous les CV tu les envoies, les recruteurs finissent sans voix
T'es trop calé pour cet emploi pour eux le profil tu ne l'as pas
Alors tu te bats, tu t'appliques, tu restes loin des trafics,
T'as le courage et l'éthique mais le sourire lymphatique
Tu n'en peux plus de ces regards qui te fatiguent depuis tout petit
Les préjugés sur ton aspect, et les on-dit qui t'ont meurtri
Frères et soeurs je vous comprends on est tous victimes de nos atouts
Mais soyons fiers de nos différences et restons loin des apparences

C'est pas parce que t'es riche que forcément tu vis mieux
La plus belle des richesses c'est d'avoir appris à se contenter de peu
C'est pas parce que tu braques que t'es un mac'
Que t'as le courage d'affronter seul l'homme à la matraque
C'est pas parce que t'es mignonne séduisante que tu me plais
Je préfère une femme simple qui résonne et qui cache sa beauté
C'est pas parce que tu l'aimes que forcément t'es amoureux
Mentir c'est se trahir soi-même, je t'assure que ça rend pas plus heureux
C'est pas parce qu'on vient de la rue qu' on n'a pas le droit aux études
Qu'on a pas de but, qu'on est condamné à vivre les pieds dans le bitume
C'est pas parce qu'ils sont séparés que tes parents ne t'aiment plus
Un jour tu comprendras qu'on choisit pas et que la vie l'a voulu
C'est pas parce que t'es grand balaise et fort
Que t'as la santé et la forme que t'es invulnérable face à la mort
Alors si t'es anéanti et que tu te sens offensé

There were things between me and God that were blocking my view.

I thought I was on a sinking ship. 

Until,
I went on a balloon ride

I said ""What a surprise. You're one of those guys I haven't seen since 1998.""
We talked for a while, and I tried to smile as he told me about his college life.
He parties Fridays through Thursdays (but not for birthdays).
He's acquired a taste for Miller Lite.

The point I could convey
If only I could find the words to say to let You know
How much You've touched my life because

Here is where You're finding me
In the exact same place as New Year's Eve
And from the lack of my persistency
We're less than half as close as I wanna be

And the first time that You opened Your eyes
Did You realize that You would be my Savior?
And the first breath that left Your lips
Did You know that it would change this world forever?

And the first time that You opened Your eyes
Did You realize that You would be my Savior?

The things I've felt in prior years
To what this midnight made so clear
That You have come to meet me here

To look back and think that
This Baby would one day save me
And the hope that, that You give
That You were born so I might really live

us collage kids!

i questioned why i did

i'm poor, i'm starving, i'm flat broke
i've got no cash to spend
sell all my books for front row tickets
to dave matthews band
my girlfriends at another school
i know this year will test her
i called, found out she had three other boyfrieds last semester

and that's why i say
oh no! not for me not for me
call it torture call it university
no! arts and crafts is all i need
i'll take calligraphy and
then ill make a fake degree

80 grand later i found out
that all that i had learned
is that you should show up to
take your finals and your midterms
the party scene is kinda mean
i think it's sick and twisted
the navy showed up at my dorm
and clamed that i enlisted
(repeat chorus)

don't get excited she'll say 'no'
without a doubt you see
and i've decided college girls
just won't go out with me
they make me nervous and they
allways catch me off my guard
like cell phone service
i drop out cause college is to hard

it's time to call my father
cause it's his alma mater
good grades arn't what they seem
i think he knows the dean

I can't deny this anymore, the facts ignored all done before
And if there's one in this world,
You let me know you're not that girl

Don't touch the positive with the negative end
Don't touch the positive with the negative end
Cause after all of the sparks you're left alone in the dark
Cause after all of the sparks you're left alone in the dark

And while I'm able, I think I'll label
Experience with you as a mistake
And while I'm at it, I'll say I've had it
Experience with you is a mistake

Cause I think way too much
On a one track mind
And you're so out of touch
Cause I'm so far behind
I'm trying to make sense
Out of all of this
While your fading scent
Just slips through my grip

I was thinking
Over thinking
Cause there's just too many scenarios
To think about
To figure out
If you're my dream please come true",Over Thinking

The point I could convey
If only I could find the words to say to let You know how much You've touched my life
Because here is where You're finding me, in the exact same place as New Year's eve
And from a lack of my persistency
We're less than half as close as I want to be

And the first time
That You opened Your eyes did You realize that You would be my Savior
And the first breath that left Your lips
Did You know that it would change this world forever

And so this Christmas I'll compare the things I felt in prior years
To what this midnight made so clear
That You have come to meet me here

To look back and think that
This baby would one day save me
In the hope that what You did
That you were born so I might live
To look back and think that
This baby would one day save me

And I, I celebrate the day
That You were born to die
So I could one day pray for You to save my life",I Celebrate the Day

And see the leaves on the trees begin to show
The birds would congregate and things
A song of birth a song of newer things
The wind would calm and the sun would shine
I'd go outside and I'd squint my eyes
But for now I will simply just withdraw

If I think of something worthy, I know that it's already yours
And through the times I've faded and you've outlined me again
You've just patiently waited to bring me back and then

You looked into my life and never stopped
And You're thinking all my thoughts are so simple but so beautiful
And You recite my words right back to me before I even speak
You let me know, I am understood

Your voice has broken my defense
Let me embrace salvation
Your voice has broken my defense

Relient K,"It's been a year filled with problems
But now you're here, almost as if to solve them
And I can't live in a world without you, now

All my life I've been searching for you
How did I survive in this world before you?
Cause I don't want to live another day without you, now

This is the best thing, the best thing that could be happening
And I think you would agree, the best thing is that it's happening to you and me

All I want to have is all that you can give me
And I'll give right back everything I've kept in me
Cause nothing ever felt as right as this does right now

I'll go back to before we met
Try and erase the past, try harder to forget
Cause nothing will ever be as good as here and now

Cause when I looked into your eyes and you dared to stare right back
You should have said, ""Nice to meet you, I'm your other half""

This is the best thing, the best thing that could be happening
And I think you would agree, the best thing is that it's happening

This is the best thing, the best thing that could be happening
And I think you would agree, the best thing is that it's happening to you and me

The best thing is that it's happening to you and me

I always knew
I'd find someone
I never dreamed
It'd be like this
Cause you've surpassed all that I'd hoped for and ever wished
And I'm trying so hard, with all my heart and mind
To make your life as good as you've made mine

This is the best thing, the best thing that could be happening
And I think you would agree, the best thing is that it's happening to you and me

Relient K,"I was going to spell it out in full detail but
I dropped the call before I spilled my guts
But your floor stayed clean like my conscience will be
'Cause if you heard anything, you didn't hear it from me

And I'm sweeping up the seconds that tick off the clock
And saving them for later when I'm too ticked to talk
And I need some time to search my mind
To locate the words that seem so hard to find

Sometimes I say things that I wish that I could take back
The most crucial thing I lack is a thing called tact
And if you're always so intently listening
Then the smartest thing to say is to tell myself not to say a thing

Yeah, I gotta keep quiet, quiet, don't let it all come undone
'Cause if I dare open my mouth, it'll just be to bite my tongue
To bite my tongue

It seems I'm always close minded with an open mouth
And the worst of me just seems to come right out
But I've never broken bones with a stone or a stick
But I'll conjure up a phrase that can cut to the quick

And sometimes I say things that I wish that I could take back
The smartest thing to say is to tell myself

To keep quiet, quiet, don't let it all come undone
'Cause if I dare open my mouth, it'll just be to bite my tongue
I gotta keep quiet, quiet and listen to your voice
Because the power of your words can repair all that I've destroyed

And when I finally do, let it come from you
The peace of understanding grips my soul
You're the reason I've found meaning in this life
So I'll swallow up my pride and give you control, I give it to you

Relient K,"I better rest my eyes 'cause I am growing weary of
This point you've been trying to make
So rather than imply, why don't you just verbalize
All the things that you're trying to say?

I guess it turned out so well
But I'm beginning to see that instead, it's trouble
Into a pattern, we fell
Of prolonging the inevitable

Why don't you come right out and say it?
Even if the words are probably gonna hurt
I'd rather have the truth than something insincere
Why don't you come right out and say it?
What it is you're thinking
Though I'm thinking, it's not what I wanna hear

I better check my pride
Because I was starting to think, I was onto something good
But things started to slide
And I'm thinking in retrospect, understanding that I misunderstood

Thought I could make up your mind
You had a decision locked up so tight, it couldn't be touched
Thought you were being so kind
By keeping your mouth sealed shut rather than just opening it up

Why don't you come right out and say it?
Even if the words are probably gonna hurt
I'd rather have the truth than something insincere
And why don't you come right out and say it?
What it is you're thinking
Though I'm thinking, it's not what I wanna hear

And now try to guess what goes on in your head
'Cause in your mind, I just might find all those things you left unsaid
Now try to make you not regret anything, later on, after I'm gone
You'll wish that you had listened to me, had listened to me

Why don't you come right out and say it?
Even if the words are gonna hurt we're better off this way
Why don't you come right out and say, come right out and say
What I know you're thinking anyway?

Why don't you come right out and say it?

I'd rather have the truth than something insincere

Relient K,I just wasted ten seconds of your life,Crayons Can Melt on Us for All I Care
Relient K,"I can smell the death on the sheets, covering me
I can't believe this is the end

But this is my deathbed, I lie here alone
If I close my eyes tonight, I know I'll be home

The year is 1941
I was 8 years old and far, far too young
To know that the stories of battles and glory
Was a tale, a kind mother made up for a son

You see, dad was a traveling preacher
Teaching the words of the teacher
Mother had sworn he went off to the war
And died there with honor, somewhere on a beach there

But he left once, to never return
Which taught me that I should unlearn
Whatever I thought a father should be
I abandoned that thought like he abandoned me

By '47, I was fourteen
I'd acquired a taste for liquor and nicotine
I smoked until I threw up, yet I still lit 'em up
For thirty more years, like a machine

So right there you have it, that one filthy habit
Is what got me where I am today

I can smell the death on the sheets, covering me
I can't believe this is the end
I can hear the sad memories still haunting me
So many things I'd do again

But this is my deathbed, I lie here alone
If I close my eyes tonight, I know I'll be home

Got married on my 21st
Eight months before my wife would give birth
It's easier to be sure you love someone
When a father inquires with the barrel of a gun

The union was far from harmonious
No two people could've been more alone than us
The years would go by and she'd love someone else
And I realized I hadn't been loved yet myself

From there, it's your typical spiel
Yeah, if life was a highway, I was drunk at the wheel
I was helpin' the loose ends all fall apart
Yeah, I swear I was destined to fail and fail from the start

I bowled about 6 times a week
A bottle of Beam kept the memories from me
Our marriage had taken a 7-10 split
And along with my pride, the ex-wife took the kids

I can smell the death on the sheets, covering me
I can't believe this is the end
I can hear those sad memories still haunting me
So many things I'd do again

But this is my deathbed, I lie here alone
If I close my eyes tonight, I know I'll be home

I was so scared of Jesus but he sought me out
Like the cancer in my lungs, it's killing me now
And I've given up hope on the days I have left
But I cling to the hope of my life in the next

Well, then Jesus showed up, said, ""Before we go up
I thought that we might reminisce
See one night in your life, when you've turned out the lights
You asked for and prayed for my forgiveness""

You cried, wolf, the tears, they soaked your fur
The blood dripped from your fangs, you said, ""What have I done?""
You loved that lamb with every sinful bone
And there you wept alone, your heart was so contrite

You said, ""Jesus, please forgive me of my crimes
Sanctify this withered heart of mine
Stay with me until my life is through
And on that day, please take me home with you""

I can smell the death on the sheets, covering me
I can't believe this is the end
I can hear you whisper to me, ""It's time to leave
You'll never be lonely again""

But this was my deathbed, I died there alone
When I closed my eyes tonight, you carried me home

I am the way, follow me and take my hand
And I am the truth, embrace me and you'll understand
And I am the light and for me, you'll live again
For I am love, I am love, I, I am love",Deathbed
Relient K,"So I've made up my mind
I will pretend to leave this world behind
And in the end, you'll know I've lied

I'm faking my own suicide because I know you love me
You just haven't realized
I'm faking my own suicide, they'll hold a double funeral
Because a part of you will die along with me

I wish you thought that I was dead
So rather than me, you'd be depressed instead
And before arriving at my grave, you'd come to the conclusion
You'd loved me all your days but it's too late, too late for you to say

Because I'm faking my own suicide because I know you love me
You just haven't realized
I'm faking my own suicide, they'll hold a double funeral
Because a part of you will die along with me

I'll write you a letter that you'll keep
Reminding you, your love for me is more than six feet deep
You say aloud that you would have been my wife
Right about that time is when I come back to life
And let you know, I'd let you know

All along I was faking my own suicide because I know you loved me
You just never realized
I was faking my own suicide
I'll walk in that room and see your eyes opened so wide
Opened so wide, because you know

Because you know you will never leave my sight
Until the day that I die for the first time
And we'll laugh, yeah, we'll laugh and we will cry

We're in the palm of a hand, making a fist

And I just hope you can forgive me too

So don't you dare blame me
For prying open the door
That's unleashed the bitterness
That's here in the midst of this
Sometimes we live for no one but ourselves

And what we've been striving for
Has turned into nothing more
Than bodies, limp on the floor
Victims of falling short
We kiss goodbye, the cheek of our true love

Searching for something I can't see
I've just got bruised and battered hands

A torch reveals there's nothing left

Screaming out, ""Someone, someone please
Please shine a light into the black
Wade through the depths and bring me back""

And the sleigh's in the shop
'Cause it's broken down,
But Christmas won't stop

'Cause Santa Claus is thumbing to town, uh-oh
Santa Claus is thumbing to town, uh-oh
Santa Claus is thumbing to town, uh-oh

Very much to his disliking

With a sign that reads, ho ho slow down

To pick themselves up when they think they can,

Save a hard learned lesson on how to not make the same mistake.
And you may be delirious but that is something that will fade,
After you confess that this mess is all something that you made.

Oh, because the judge of you is someone I could never be,

You'll emerge eventually.

And when you do, then people start to hate you,
You scream what you believe out loud in a crowd,
And they will hate you,
Cause repetition's just so safe,
And repetition's just like prison,
And I prefer to be out of place,
Cause I'm not really into prison.

I think that we would have been friends.
There's only time,to live our lives, 
You'll be the one that's by my side.
And I can promise you, then you'll always be my best friend.

Till the end when we part, I will give you my heart, 
And will promise to love you with all that it is,
And I will promise to be there whenever you need me, 
Because you'll always be my best friend.

Relient K,"I can't keep a straight face and say this is not the end
Not if you want it it's upon us and I wanna say it's sinking in
If I was hasty maybe I was rushed along
I won't move into little boxes and then not get the itch to move on

So think real slow
Don't forget that yes is yes and no is no
Melting prints of grass and snow
Means I may forget the way to get back home
'Cause this is the end if you want it
This is the end

You're not the first thing in my life I've loved and lost
Yeah I've thought worse things that 
I might be less inclined to merely just shrug off

You'll take me home
Like my family did my father did I know
You'll think real slow
But don't forget the speed that I can go away
'Cause this is the end if you want it
Yeah this is the end

I've been convincing myself that I'm worthwhile
'Cause I'm worth what I'll convince myself to be

I met the devil and I stared her in the eyes
Her hair had scales like silver serpents
I, a statue, stood there mesmerized

I took the fire escape and made it out alive
Yeah I still burn from time to time but I've a healing hand against my side

Frozen from the sleet burned sand and stones

Who pales when they compare
When they compare

Can't hold a candle to her
'Cause all the moths get in the way

Entire attire until it frays

For she outshines anyone
Whoever might dare to bask in
The same candlelight

Oh please don't seat us in the back
With all the insects and the trash
She is a lady, I'm the tramp
Collecting stares from pairs close by
Then flutters in a butterfly
Ew, just a moth drawn to the lamp

She's like an ancient artifact
Something you're lucky to have found
She'll pinch the nerves in all the necks
When she turns those heads around
Those heads around

Can't hold a candle to her
'Cause all the moths get in the way

Can I push it aside
Is it time I befriended all the ghosts of all the things that haunt me most

Move on with my life

Knowing of thirst is how I've died
Choke on my tongue

Lying on the night
Beneath the dunes is where I lie block the sun

Trying to ignite
Some sort of passion from inside
To overcome

This feeling of desertion
Can't be worse then having any words

So I'll ask one thing, just one thing
Of you, don't turn me loose even when I turn my back

Was it the lying or his pride which brought him down
Once the king of beast but now they feast
On the thoughts beneath his faking crown.

Trying to decide was it the lying or the pride which brought him down.
To be alone to be de-crowned believe me I know all about it now

So I'll ask one thing, just one thing

Don't ever turn me loose, even when I turn my back

I never told you then that I'd be easy to love
Supposedly I'm a man but I feel like a CUB
I wondered if the planes flying farther away
Not ever knowing I would never come back the same

As my lungs gave way, I swear I felt something burst,
It's been 13 days and I'm dying of thirst.
For the birds who prey I pray that someone else will get here first.

If I'm not alone, I'll be alright
Just take these bones and bring them back to life.

So I'll ask one thing, just one thing

Black and white notebooks and ball-point pens
The first day of school, might make some new friends
From the 103, dreams to me was a Benz
Or the 3 o'clock bell that sounds when school ends

Lunch room status, we used to roll dice
Bang beats on the tables to see who was nice
Swore we knew it all, didn't want no advice
How unfortunate, some paid the ultimate price

We used to cut class all day, roam around the hallways
With little wooden passes
I remember 6th grade, assembly, shirt with tie
The young little Remedy, wonderin why

I did what I was told to get to junior high
'cause at that point in time I believed I could fly
Big blue binders, young designer finders
Livin' in the world with no rules, high school

Language arts, I sat and wrote darts
My mind ran wild and free like +Young Hearts+
Mathematics, where I based my foundation
Fall to the nation on wack Education

Tryin to tell much of the story of Columbus
Tryin to brain-numb us, when all you see, that came from us

Taggin Wu logos on the corner in my book margin
Phat shoe laces and tri-colored sneakers
I stood up like a man then I questioned the teacher
""How did Europeans black out in dark ages?
And when it got light did they white-wash the pages?
Why is it average college kids stuck with low wages?
You wonder why these students walk around with 12 gauges?""

To all those races, colors, and creeds, every man bleeds for the 
Countless victims and all their families of
The murdered, tortured and slaved, raped, robbed and persecuted
Never again, to the men, women, and children.
Who died in their struggle to survive, never to be forgotten.
Reuven ben menachum, yo

Yo my own blood, dragged through the mud
Perished in my heart still cherished and loved
Stripped of our pride, everything we lived for
Families cried, there's no where to run to, no where to hide
Tossed to the side, access denied
Six million died for what? Yo a man shot dead in his back
Helpless women and children under constant attack 
For no reason, till the next season, and we still bleeding
Yo it's freezing, and men burn in hell, some for squeezing 
No hope for a remedy, nothing to believe
Moving targets who walk with the star in their sleeve
Forever marked wit a number, tattooed to your body
Late night, eyes closed, clutched to my shotty
Having visions, flashes of death camps and prisons, no provisions
Deceived by the devils decisions, forced into a slave
Death before dishonor for those men who were brave 
Shot and sent to their grave, can't awaken, it's too late
Everything's been taken, I'm shaken, family, history, the making

Never again shall we march like sheep to the slaughter
Never again shall we sit and take orders
Stripped of our culture, robbed of our name
Raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames
Forced from our families, taken from our homes
Moved from our god then burned of our bones
Never again, never again, shall we march like sheep to the slaughter
Leave our sons and daughters, stripped of our culture
Robbed of our name
Raped of our freedom and thrown into the flames
Forced from our families, taken from our homes
Moved from our god and everything we own

Some fled through the rumors of wars
But most left were dead, few escaped to the shores
With just one loaf of bread, banished, hold in for questioning
And vanished, never to be seen again, I can't express the pain
That was felt in the train to Auschwitz, tears poured down like rain
Naked face to face, with the master race, hatred blood and David
My heart belongs to God and stay sacred
Rabbi's and priests, disabled individuals 
The poor, the scholars all labeled common criminals
Mass extermination, total annihilation
Shipped into the ghetto and prepared for liquidation
Tortured and starved, innocent experiments
Stripped down and carved up or gassed to death
The last hour, I smelled the flowers
Flashbacks of family then sent to the showers
Powerless undressed, women with babies clumped tight to their chest 
Crying, who would've guessed, dying, another life lost
Count the cost, another body gas burned and tossed in the holocaust

Never again, never again

This is a story brought before me, from the wise and the old
Take it down from the past, before ya eyes to unfold
Now I took this, crafted it and made it the mold
For all those rainy nights, left out in the cold
Yeah, the rat race, movin' at a nine-to-five pace
A life story based on paper chase
What's goin' on? Something's wrong in the world that we live
But if we hold on long enough it gotta give
How many times must history repeat in itself
Face defeat, mankind, be beat by himself
Generations done passed son, look at the last one
There's no more legends in the making, ask one
Man, money, then power, sex, rock and drugs
Economics, politics and thugs
I said, man, money and power, sex, rap and drugs
Anxiety, society fucks

Unspoken words only heard from behind the closed door
Politicians hide themselves away, but started the war
Watch the day go out in fight, they leave that up to the poor (Give it to me)
And if you got another minute, I can tell you some more
Hey yo, never judge a book by it's cover, never cheat on ya lover
Never rob, never steal, love thy brother (Give me a remedy)
Never count ya money, always count ya blessings (Yeah)
Never say never, always learn ya lessons
In the land once filled wit mad milk and honey (give it to me)
What a man wouldn't do just for the taste of money (Yay)
What a woman wouldn't do for the touch of a man (Give it to me)
It's those feelings deep inside of you, you don't understand
Lookin' for ya self, but you lost from within

But tonight's tonight, whether wrong or right
This type of shit, wit the flavor like raw spit
Smokin' out, and it figures, it figures
The peeps around me, keep their fingers on the triggers

I keep a shorty between my lap cool, and flyin' down the freeway
Coppin' a wop 'cause it's ""me-day""
Went over to pick my toys up, we make a lot of noise
'Cause, we can do that, cat, in my habitat

Yo, be nimble, I do the type of evil that men do
Like pissin' out my window on a bitch and her friend too
So turn the volume up a notch and let me in ya crotch
Bu-bump, I hit ya g-spot

That's the fuck, when I jump at nature
Like, hump, hump, hump, hump, hump, hump
But if you want to see a dick gigantic, not romantic
More Slicker than my man Rick

I caught my first half brick in '87
I thought I knew it all, few years past eleven
Middle class kid, who grew up fast, kid
Sharp as glass, skin'll crush like a large mouth bass
In a world movin' fast, can't live in the past
Momma said that the best things in life don't last
Another chapter in the storybook, one more sung
And it's so true, only the good die young
This great country has gone to hell
Nobody listened til the Trade Center fell
Everything that once was good, has just turned back
Happiness has faded to sad
This is just what the industry ordered
Come and get your therapy, Remedy, my own worst enemy
The hits come free, straight from the M.C.
The are-E-M D, now, that's me

Now I retired from the drug game
Self preservation on my family name
I got into this music game, with thoughts about fortune and fame
To find the music and drug game were two in the same
We got dealers turned artists and artists turned dealers
Squealers, pro stealers and big four wheelers
Iced out chains and platinum frames
And big big guns and big big names and
Hollywood's burnin', it must be the music
You can ask E. Sermon (do-do-do-do-doo)
We got, club promoters who turned label owners
Yo feed the homeless, man, we need blood donors
Here's an M.C. advisory, nothin' about the industry's clean
The only thing that matters is green
It is what it is and exactly what how it seems
Cash Rules Everything Me, C.R.E.A.M.

When you see me on the street and just walk on by (R-E-M-E, D-Y)

Now I looked the major labels straight dead in their face
And I told 'em, ""yeah ya'll, thanks but no thanks""

They want to sell me fame but I don't want to buy it
My name in the game is enough, keep quiet
They got live bait and they wheelin' in fish

Left me empty here - and now I know why

All along I was looking for something else
You're something else
All along I was looking for something more
You're so much more
I finally found what I could never see before
You've always been the one that I was looking for

All of my castles in the sand - washed away again
And I'm left back where I began tonight

No place for me to fit into
Empty face with a painted smile

I don't understand at all

But when You find me in my busy streets of emptiness
Remind me I'm not ever on my own

I don't know how You love me like you do
It's so good to belong with You
And in the places I'm a stranger too
It's so good to belong with You
To belong with You

Is it really worth it in the end
To try, try time and time again?
Looking for what has always been right there

And there's no reason I should ever feel alone
'Cause You are with me every where I go

Nunca supe valorarte 
Y de pronto te perdí 

Eres mi todo, te necesito 
Vuelve a mi lado te lo suplico
No hay una forma de consolarme
Quiero tenerte y volver amarte

Regresa pronto yo te lo ruego
Pues sin tus besos casi me muero

Porque te fuiste y ya no te encuentro

Para recapacitar
Y poder comerte a besos

Remmy Valenzuela,"Al llegar la estación cariñosa 
Donde alegres cantaban las aves 
Vamos pues mi querida Rosita 
A escuchar esos dulces cantares

Ya cayo un pajarillo silvesre 
Ya cayo un pajarillo jilgero 
Ya cayeron un par de gorriones 
Ya cayo el gavilán prisionero

Cuando a mexico vaya Rosita 
A venderlos a la capital 
Cinco pesos sera el menos precio 
Que ellos puedan valer por alla

Si al pasar te pregunta una dama 
Que si son pajarillos silvestres 
Les dirás que su tierra no es esta 
Que los traes de tierra caliente

Ya se va mi querida Rosita 
Se despide con gusto y afán

Remo,"I am a victim of tragedy
And I am a victim of fate
And I live inside a few memories
Of someone who walks in the past

So now hear the things that I wanna say
And I see that you really care
Don't wanna be somebody who keeps the faith
In something that's no longer there

I believed there would've been another chance
For us all to get kid of the storm
But you see I've got nothing in my hands
And I weep like never before

Time goes by and I'm still running
Running down an endless road
Getting further toward the future
Just to find my way home

I am a victim of agony
And I am a victim of pain
And I'll live forever in your fantasy
Cause we both, we just feel the same

I'm yours alone, and I'm in love to stay
As we go through the years day by day",Day by Day

And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin

More lost without you and so it goes

When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Just an affair of the past

And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

Out of the ordinary unusual
You gotta have the mind state like I'm so great
Can't nobody do it like you do
Miraculous, phenomenal and ain't nobody in here stopping you
Show no love cause you what's up
Look at ya self in the mirror like what the fuck

Damn I look good and can't nobody freak it like I could
Yea OK I got a little fat but
My shorty told me that he like it like that
I'm happy
Another nigga never can't be
I'm so outstanding
Don't care if they can't stand me
I'm sitting on top of the world like brandy

See I look to good for this necklace
And I look to good to be wearing this
You know I look way too good to be innocent
I'm conceited I got a reason

See I look to good to be driving that
And I look to good to be buying that
You know I look way to good to be trying that
I'm conceited I got a reason

Now who's that peaking in my window
Nobody cause I live in a penthouse
Baby I'm sorry but I'm sexy
And all I want you to do is just bless me, lets see
This kid that I'm waiting on
He said he loves when my jeans look painted on
Wit a tight white tee, you ain't quite like me
Probably why I'm always getting hated on
Now shorty tryna push up on me like a wonder bra
Listen when I speak out I wouldn't want you take it wrong
Now number one I don't need you
Ya names Q I only see you wen I see you
Listen two you never play me
Why is that? why is that?
Cause I'm such a fucking lady
And three is all about me I don't want to talk about it
If you'd like to hear it here it go
Here you go I wrote a song about it

See I look to good to be fucking you
And I look to good to be loving you
You know I look way to good to stuck with you
I'm conceited I got a reason

See I look too good to be getting with
And I look to good to be having kids

I'm out of control wit it
Dip it low pick it up slow poke it out now roll wit it
My thong showing but it's cool my shoes go wit it
Now all I need is a room wit a pole in it
See I look good and I'm knowing it
But I was never to proud to be showing it

See I look to good for this necklace
And I look to good to be wearing this
You know I look way too good to be innocent
I'm conceited I got a reason

See I look to good to be driving that
And I look to good to be buying that

And I look to good to be loving you
You know I look way to good to stuck with you

Because I was always pretty
I find a dumb nigga gettin dough and do his pockets dirty
But see that wasn't workin
And I wasn't tryna work in
I got my own work in
I started puttin work in
Some say it ain't worth it
I say I ain't perfect
Matter of fact I'm sayin, doin the fuck I feel
I make people nervous
Who say I ain't bout it
I'm still from the projects
What you talkin bout bitch
I sets it on bounces
I don't think you understand son
You know how many clubs I been from
And I can careless
I'm so careless
I'm from the generation where we did shit because you dared us

Remy Ma,"He put the gun in my hand
I took my hand and put the gun in my pants
I took my pants and pull them up on my ass
Got the cash outta my pocket
Dropped it and got my ass in the Dodge
I put it into the car and started it

Stepped on the gas and looked at the gas
And 95 don't seem fast when you're so fucking mad
And so you're fucking high and can't stop crying
Oh shit, I just ran a stop sign

Fuck it, it's nothing
This nigga got me stressing
I can't believe, he got me bugging
Now I'm driving reckless, I can't even see

And my high beams ain't really helping
But nobody really be using the streets before seven
Got the pedal to the medal like I lost my mind
And I ain't need to see the school crossing sign

Car in the fastest gear, wind blowin' in my hair
Seat beat light blinking but I don't care
Somebody crossing the street, came outta nowhere
Went right into 'em, body flew in the air

Oh my God, my face already covered with tears
Sayin' my prayers, I didn't even see I swear
I thought off of reflex, saw blood everywhere
Mostly ran ahead of the little girl, holding a teddy bear

I'm sorry, all I can hear is, ""I want my mommy""
And then I ain't hear nothin' from the little girl's body
I'm scared but I can't stop, what am I gonna do?
The first thing the cops are gonna say, ?Is it was drug influence??

They ain't gonna understand, what this nigga was doin'
How he made me drive fast when I should have been cruisin'
And they probably won't believe that it wasn't the weed
And shorty just popped up in the middle of the street

And they really gonna be hatin' this gun on my waist
And I checked shorty's pulse and I don't think she's gonna make it
Dial 911 or damn should I run?
I'm just weightin' out my options before someone comes

If I stay I go to jail, if I run I'll be wrong
This is taking too long, fuck it I'm gone

Hit and run, damn I should hit my brakes
Hit and run, sometimes we all make mistakes
Hit and run, I guess, I'm not that heartless
Hit and run 'cause now I got a guilty conscience",Guilty

I like a pimp got my gators and my pimp 
You take orders and run errands 
I take vactions with killers and four time felons
You outside on line like where the weed 
I'm inside getting high V.I.P stats
You where the rats and the D's at 
I'm where the be's and the see's and the real O.G's at 

[Verse 1:]
Ayo the girl spits harder than most dudes 
I give it to you on any given Sunday like soul food 
I ain't even gotta double my vocals
I do a main scence that lives and the rest is produce 
I'm in the booth wit no shoes and my chain be bangin the mic so I don't got on no jewels
I'm so hot and I done told you 
You ain't no kiddin to me so basically I don't know you 
You don't know me homie I clap you with yo heat 
If this was a lake 
I'd be a mother fucking Ojay 
Set off the sirens form thy alliance
Its a four alarm blaze and I'm on fire 
I was talking to Kanye and I heard the wire 
That I'm the truth and your a liar
I'm the queen of rap and there is none higher and all you slut bag hoers should call me sire

All these other chicks is wack and I'm the shit 
See I'm from New York so I repped the Knicks
I'mma I'mma Husslin I could get them bricks
They say my flow is crazy and I could spit and I rap as if I had a dick
Bitches is bad but I'm that bitch 
Listen I'm so above the average
Now my walk is mean but my whip is sick
I can't stand a clown but I love a trick 
I see a group of dudes and I take my pick 
Like you you and you with the Timbs hi nice to meet you my name is Rem
I don't drive a caddy but I'm stuntin like a pimp struct
With a diddy bop looking something like a lick 
I cleaned up my money now I'm filthy fucking rich (shit)

See I'm from where niggas stash packs in the backs of their ball sack and pump crack, yak, D, weed and that 
Put more baking soda in there coke to get more back

We kill all rats tell lies cheat and steal 
Tints pitch black even gotta em on the windsheild
Liscense suspended Vehicles rented 
Warrants open cases several offenses
No phone no cable notices of eviction 
Parents is addicted kids don't listen 
No rules no school no food in the kitchen and the staircase and elevator smell like piss
You can only talk tough if you do tough things 
If you ain't from around here you better tuck them blings
Only difference between me and you is that I got out the hood but the hood is still in me

N I'm always lyin...it's never the truth...it never crossed you're mind that I couldve been in the booth??
...Tryna hurry up n get back home to you, tryna get these checks so we could get out the 'jects
I wasn't thinkin bout no niggas, wasn't thinkin bout sex..tryna do this show so I could get this dough.

We'd eat cereal together, watch cartoons wen we got up
So I couldnt believe that you flipped on me right in the streets for a bitch so weak that ain't got shit but
A fucked up weave n I'm your blood, your little sister, I started to cry... said it must be the liquor,
See I almost died wen you took sides with her then walked off, and just left me there, like I was nobody n you really ain't care.
Said you would die for me, how you ain't gon ride wit me, how you see me on the block and don't say hi to me??
It's all love now, n its all done now, but you never took the time to apoligize to me...
It may be hard to see, but it bothers me... I know you ain't gon let nobody do no harm to me...
But you can't be actin like you fathered me...so I'm askin you, wut I'm suppose to do??

[CHORUS]

Listen y'all, I kno it seem like I be dissin y'all,
I'm jus tryina reach my goals and remain focused but
Ain't shit changed, naw, I'm still the same
So wish me well,
Sometimes I might scream and yell...
But even people with a fan base have bad days but
Ain't shit changed, for real, I'm still the same.


Mommy... you was the one that named me, but you didn't raise me...
You left me all alone, I had to home my own,
But now I'm all grown n far away from home
I kno you love me, but you did me wrong...
I guess it was all the drugs that you was on or the beatings you got from my foul step pops...
Remember the time his punk ass had the nerve to raise his hands to me bitch nigga blackin my eye...
I was wishin he would die, now I wish him life.
I kno he seein me blowin, and its killin him slowly, but what kills me is that you watched him hit me, 
So I'm askin you, wut I'm suppose to do??

[CHORUS]
Listen y'all, I kno it seem like I be dissin y'all,
I'm jus tryina reach my goals and remain focused but
Ain't shit changed, naw, I'm still the same

Remy Ma,"Let me make love, love to you
Let me thrill you with my song
Let me replace the love and the faith

Could it be, you're fallin' in love
With a thug right now
Could it be you're fallin' in love
With a thug's life style
Could it be you're fallin' in love
Right now, right now, right now

Could it be, it can't be Pun I'm callin' ya bluff
I must be high off this weed 'cause I ain't fallin' in love
All that I eva dreamed of was fuckin' a thug
So I could bust a few slugs and sell a little drugs
Be up in the Benz, chillin', rollin' ya blunts
Have the Spanish mommies illi' 'cause I'm sittin' in front

And niggas on the block sick like what cha doin' wit that spic
Y'all don't know? Puerto Ricans and blacks make the cutest kids
Ya hair, my eyes, ya nose, and my lips
If it's a boy, I hope that God bless him with his daddy's dick, shit
To tell the truth with you. I know, I'm safe and another nigga
Frontin' and get blown in his face and I like that

You give me love and I give it right back
But when you flip don't you think I ain't gon' fight back
Pun you got dough and you know, I got a nice stack
So when you mad, go ahead take ya ice back
I just throw on some lipstick and the stylistics break up to make up

And you know, I hook a steak up, take you breakfast in bed
Nigga, soon as you wake up, get my jewels back
And take another trip to see Jacob, lovin' the way I do this for you
And every kiss that I blew, poppy chew was a kiss for you
Stayed true, faithful, you can never say, ""I played you""
'cause you ma boo and I can never say, ""I hate you""

Could it be, you're fallin' in love
With a thug right now
Could it be you're fallin' in love
With a thug's life style
Could it be you're fallin' in love
Right now, right now, right now

I swept you off ya feet, you was just walkin' crossin' the street
And you was talkin' to me or was it my boys in the jeep
Either or she said she loved the way I play ball
Go after the bigger niggas even though there was nice and tall
Shootin' dice in the hall inside of my doorway checkin' my drawers

Up north style right next to ma boys, just the little things
Would impress her a lot like when I let her sit in the lex tryna
Guess, where it's at, God blessed her with ass
She had the perfect mix, she was Morena with an Indian twist
She had the cinnamon lips the edge was rimmy and crisp

I thought she was Dominican the way she was swinging them hips
I never had a clue that she wanna ride with me but I'm like Darnell
Shorty had eyes for me, it's a quarter passed one
But that's another song, what was wrong? Why you took so long
To put a brotha on? It was't long before we start bumpin'and grindin'

Crushin' her spine and had her soundin' like Busta was rhyming
Bustin' her hymen, the sight of sex she start bustin' out cryin'
Her bus went by and she was ready up in there rydin'
Cussin' and wildin', talkin' dirty in the back of the porch
Whose pussy is this? Come on, daddy, it's yours

Could it be, you're fallin' in love
With a thug right now
Could it be you're fallin' in love
With a thug's life style
Could it be you're fallin' in love
Right now, right now, right now

Is rated again

When I was sure you'd follow through
My world was turned to blue so thin
When you'd hide your songs would die
So I'd hide yours with mine
And all my words were bound to fail
I know you won't fail

Remy Zero,"Tea time

In our little house there's always room
for all the friends that help us through
these struggling days.

And we never want for anything
that can't be had from one of them.
It's better than money.

We're alive.
We get by.
You can spend the night.
You can sleep right here.

And we got heavy traffic on the stairs
with darlin' Sherrie over there,
and Sarah's back in town.
Kim and Kay sit on the floor
while Zelda hides the closet doors,
never to be found.

See John smile and Mia sigh.
Katie cries.

Mia plays the violin.

Chorus:

This little world is all I need.
And hey, this little world needs
not much more to be a
completely perfect world.

We will be leaving soon
and we might never get back to you.
But before we do,
goodbye and fare thee well.

We're drinking up all of Eric's Gin,
waiting for all this weather to end.
And we know it will.

Now it's Jane and Sophie at the door.
We rarely see them anymore.
Kandi comes with Lou.
Come on in.
Where've you been?
Come on in.

Repeat chorus.

Well, the neighbors have a little boy.
They still put up with all our noise,
and it's nice of them.

Oh, Paris keeps the upstairs bright.
Kafka ran away last night.
We hope he comes back.
He's our dog.

Yes, I think he's gone,
and that's too bad.

He was a good dog.

Repeat chorus.

Ahh, hello big world...",Goodbye Little World
Remy Zero,"You show me a sign
To rise up from the world we know 
And she's strung out on life
He soon rolls his teeth
Spilling out from a mouth into overflow back into me

Chorus:
She moves and it's fire
Underwater...
Speaks and it's flame
She speaks my name...
Well they all really want you
If only you had wanted them
Lights move to the chalk line
Change into dream that I am 
Here we are again
How could I have seen
Always she's driving...
How could I have known
Right through the strange calling
Straight through the sound
Gramarye I've found
See how she's driving me down

Straight from the sound
She is seen as a bright sun to anyone
Hollow in mind
With the weight of the world
Trailing out 'til the last stream discovers me
Alive on vine
(Repeat Chorus)
I used to see something in the idea
But only once did my hands reach anything beautiful
Now she's turned away and I'm so...
(Repeat Chorus)",Gramarye
Remy Zero,"Your sad songs rain heaven.
Here's a call for you,
so don't let it fall into your
frail dreams of horror.
Life, lies, and shattered blows,
calling out you're famous.

Chorus:

So hold to your permanent bliss
in the time that it takes to exist.
From the hours to the fall of it.

It's all right.

You're all wrong.

And it's a dangerous thing to ignore.
It's so easy when the world has it's way,
well, then you're gone.

Life, limbs, and shattered blows
scrawling out you're famous.

Repeat chorus

Alright, I never said
to just cast them out.
Leave it 'til the morning
then you're gone.

So long.

Cast them out.

Now you're alive.

Remy Zero,"It felt like the sun
We are hollow
Light to the world
Film star

Define all the ways
We are hollow
I am the ghost
You are song

So you walk away from me
Were you ever there?
You were too quick or cold to believe
Unbelievable
You can never fail, we can never fail
We can only go down south
In flames a place you forgot about

Ooh

We are hollow
Light to the world
Film star
Define all the ways
We are hollow
I am the ghost
You are song

Lights that freeze turn perfect scenes into sorrow
Don't slip away
With all the words you had to say
You never had a prayer
You can never fail
We can never lose
We can only come down
Sink to your knees, let the others fire, sound

Well I fell out in the traffic
All that noise is coming at me
Cover noise and scream
And she was every kind of creature
Every twist that I imagined of a space

All your strength is about to be found
Crawling up out of the ground
Now play what you wanted to play
You say what you wanted to say
You finally found a way
All of the stars coming down

How did it feel when you hit the ground
It felt like the sun
We are hollow
Light to the world

Remy Zero,"I once had marigolds for eyes.
I've seem to fade on sunny days.
When it's cold as the rain outside
Well then, so am I

So when it comes down
You'll know
I'm with you
How could I show you?
It feels good to know
It feels good to know you

We once had oceans left to fly,
Now the trees and the river have parted ways
When it seems like the phone has died
Well then, so have I

So when it comes down
You'll know
I'm with you
How could I show you?
It feels good to know
It feels good to know you

And how will you know?
We storm from a small, thin line
We're torn from the old frames
There's no one here to pull you back again

So when it comes down, you'll know.
Mmmmm, you'll know

Helena spilt to the ground how do I show you?
Should've known soon she would come down

And closed the gates.
Shadows move all across my room
In waves of late.

Circle and cycle.
Now it's going to change, 
You say nothing stays the same.

Your minds move too fast
Until you're knocked back on the ground.

Summer here and the sun will find you
Falling out with the world around you

Cause everything's bound to change

We could work this out or just let it go
It's time to learn what we should know
That's the problem with me
See, there's a problem with me
That's the problem, problem with me

So, now you're old and the world has left you
It's so sick, you see just where they kept you down
Locked up in fear. we can change it all from here
Or simply let it disappear.

We could work this out or just let it go
It's time we learned what we should know

Remy Zero,"We took you down there 
To relapse in the sand,
And we walked out in the open 
Resolved to being seen. 

It was summer in the kitchen 
So we stretched out in the grass. 
While the ones who came before us 
Refused to let us pass. 

The vulcan rots with liquor shots
Now he falls out in the room. 

[Chorus]
The sun breaks over us.
The sun takes over us.
The sun looks over us. 

There's nothing to keep us tied here now. 

So I stay down where you are. 

So when I found you,
You'd learned to see it new.
We went driving through the capitol 
In our bathrobes and our shoes. 

The alarms had all gone crazy
With the hungers of the street,
So we loaded up on spirits 
To disfigure our defeat. 

Standing in line with the science of mind,
My mind was preparing to leap.

Of words we're twenty blocks too late.

And hey, have you heard about Mr. Crow?
Well, I think so but I don't know.
Well, you can't let your panic show.

Reach out your hollow flame,
Oh, you're hangin' so weird and strange,
Oh, your darkest days, 
They're just beginning now, ohhh

As the moon has made everything mean.
Now it tears apart my brain,
My bones is beginning to shake.

Oh, your darkest days,
They're just beginning now, ohhh

Come and leave somehow, lights to the world

From the moon and the earth to the stars.
Simple wings are simply pulled apart.

When we belong together
And we thought we were crazy
But we were so strong together

All these things 
I thought would never change

Up to the park
Meet at the car on the south side
To sleep by the fountain

Back down to the Glorious #1

Her skin's shifting, the words are so clear

We had the forest in our eyes
But the earth was in our clothes
And they thought we'd fall
Not at all
So look back on the treasured days
We were young in a world that was so tired
Though it's not what we wanted before
Even the saints had to crawl from the floor

That meant every thing to me

And the things that we used to do
And the things that we used to say
I'll remember you

Remember how they tried to hold you down
And we climbed those towers 
And looked down upon our town
And everything you hoped would last
Just always becomes your past (it hurts)

You'd sing all your little songs 
That meant everything to me 

And I'll remember you
And the things that we used to do
And the things that we used to say

But then this world 
Slipped through my fingers
And even the sun seemed tired
I still cared
As I lowered you down
My heart just jaded
In that moment the earth made no sound
But you were there
You helped me lift my pain into the air

Perdon madre tierra, perdon
Por dejarte caer, sin pensar, en el olvido

Como escapar de esta oscura realidad
Como entender, que el mundo no resiste mas
Poder escuchar, en el viento sus deseos 
Poder descansar del humano y su maldad

Que has ofrecido al nacer.",Madre Tierra

No sé porque hoy me siento tan distante de allí
Y a pesar que lo intento de nuevo

Tal vez llegue tarde ya no hay nada que hacer
Y no puedo creer que el tiempo
Que hemos tenido tal vez se nos gasto

Tal vez fui yo que no te dio una noche entera
Tal vez nunca te he dado lo que tú esperabas
Y no estaba cuando me necesitabas

Tal vez no te escuché tal vez me descuidé
Tal vez se me olvido que yo te amaba
Tal vez y puro ponzoña musical primo

Tal vez será que por ahora ya no hay nada que hablar
Tal vez esta vez necesitamos tiempo para pensar
Y yo por mi parte propongo intentarlo de nuevo

Volver a empezar que por la más
Que lo pienso no encuentro
Una sola razón para seguir sin ti

Tal vez fui yo que no te dio una noche entera
Tal vez nunca te he dado lo que tú esperabas

That we are one and I'm a part of you
Get away, any way
I'm still a secret in the heart of you
And I'm the burning in your soul

Now I'm weak, I am losing
I never thought I'd stop trying
I'm a lie, I'm just a sigh, just a crying

Ordered that his women die
A single night this for all his wives
Takes his pleasure then their lives
And so for many days with the dawn
The sultan had his way
Wives were put to death
His name on their dying breath
Then one day as the evening came
Sultan sends for him a wife
Choose her well charms I wish to see
Bring her, send her in to me
Then came scheherazade to his side
And her beauty shone
Like a flower grown
Gentle as he'd ever known
Scheherazade bewitched him
With songs of jeweled keys
Princes and of heroes
And eastern fantasies
Told him tales of sultans
And talismans and rings
A thousand and one nights she sang
To entertain her king
She sings, scheherazade, scheherazade, etc
""the young prince and the young princess as told by scheherazade"" 
And you would cause the sun to see your light
And then be shamed
You cover darkness with a thousand secret flames
With your love, oh my love, oh my love, my love
And I would cause the winds to blow a hundred different days
And bring the perfumes of the gardens of the ways
Of your love, oh my love, oh my love, my love
Crystal and the clay, nights and the days
All on the prince's seal
Eagle of the sky, lion of the earth
This is what the seal is worth, what the seal is worth
Holds all of the dreams of a man
Tapestries, wishes of man, pictures and visions of man
The spirit of the soul of the man
And he would vow to love her for the rest of all his days

The bearers of your gifts now all around you stand

The people watch you step into the sun
Stalls and bars of every kind
Food piled high on woven leaves for all to eat
Drums and flutes at every turn
The music winding, twisting through the crowded streets
Caravans from far away bring people laughing
People come to see the sultan in baghdad today

Her tale is told

Renaissance,"The sisters worked for the people round them
Their Spanish lace wove some bread for the poor
And they cared and tried but were worn with
Their fears and the years of heartbreak

Dust and wine stained the men who knew them
The sweat of days in the angry sun
And the men were weak, and they cried
And they asked, ""Sisters, make us holy.""

The sisters prayed, ""Give us hope for something.""
The men asked, ""Where is your God today?""
And the empty eyes as the sisters prayed held
Their thoughts unspoken

There was nothing they could do

Nothing new survived
Everything was barren on the land
And the truth they tried to understand just died

Come along with me
The day can breathe once more
To hear the sound of closing doors
The night has opened up its eyes to see day
A thousand moving just as one
A feeling that's so certain
That when this day is done
The paper lads will -

Come with the dawn, casting light on the play
Acting it out in our own special way
Making our entrance and reading the lines
The story of people who live by the Tyne

Back home once again
The streets that seemed so long
They're waking now
The job is done
See people run to catch the wheels of their lives
The cities reading every line
But while it sleeps you're working
In a world that's just your own
For paper lads alone -

In the dawn going round every day
Seeing your home town in different ways
Carry the news, solving problems you find
Though young who knows what goes on in your mind



",Back Home Once Again
Renaissance,"Fading mist you swirl and dance before my eyes
To realise
The feelings that have lay within my heart
Life in dreams is so much kinder
Just a moment's memory
To fade away, in distance lies your home

Broken city, take you with me
Soon to be harmonised
There before your eyes
Only to exist
Time has held tomorrow yearning while apart
Now the longing has begun for you

Suns will never set
And shall not forget
Promises we made
Somewhere there's a harbour
Though we pass her by
Where our ship can be and safely lie
In the warmth of her arms
Inside a perfect day

And with each passing moment
We wait to sail away



",Opening Out
Renaissance,"There bound to lazy days

Cast all their doubts away

Though she's flown, wild and free
Still behind his eyes she stays
There beneath his mind she lays
She is love

Smiles just a winter smile
Tries to hang on
Why even she can't say
What it is that's gone

That the past is still turning

The barrels spread the bait
The seagulls warningg echoed round
Winds that wouldn't wait
People gathered at the harbour
Waiting for the tide
Eyes half closed against the spray
And tears they cannot hide
Hulls were creaking crashing sails
Rains were slating down
The oilskins flapping, decks awash
Slanting turning round
Thunder roaring at the harbour
Women drawn in fear
Huddle up to wait the time
And pray the sky will clear
Howling winds and the raging waves
Cracked upon the boats
And torn from safety, torn from life
Men with little hope
Ghostly echoes at the harbour
Whispering of death
Women weeping holding hands
Of those they still have left

I can't go home for success has locked me out

You see my luck went to his head
He could have kept quiet but instead
Now everyone knows

Chorus:

I'm running away from you
I'm running away from you
I'm running away from you
And your heart

It started off just a small time scandal
The people talk and they smile to win your confidence
Mistaken trust that you took as friendship
Has let you down when you needed to be up

Well all the money in the world
Can't buy the silence of this girl
So now everyone knows


Chorus

And you know that we will always stay
Lovers in a small town kind of way
But the high life called you
I should have known but instead

Chorus

Thinking back to when I first met you
So shy and young as an innocent
You were number one
No real desires I just want to be near you

You took my love, my emotion, then off you ran
My reputation as your flag
You held it high I bet you're glad
That everyone knows

Repeat chorus to end



",Running Away From You
Renaissance,"It is nothing to live as we do
Day to day we roam
Heart without a home of our own
Dust and passion lay in our throats
Revenge in each word that spoke
Children's eyes fill our minds as we smoke

Chorus:

But somewhere out in the desert a figure moves at speed
And in his heart he carries the message that they need
We move against the tyrant
Words fall from his lips
The fire inside their eyes is lit
At daybreak freedom calls
We answer as one
From hiding in the hills we enter the burning sun

Danger fills the air and the dawn
Holds a sweet but stale perfume
Women know that soon they may lose
What good are men that love but our slaves
In a country they once called their own?
As they kissed goodbye they have flown


Chorus II

To be there out in the desert as horses move at speed
And in each heart is carried the message that they need
We move against the tyrant
Words fall from his lips
The fire inside their eyes is lit
At daybreak freedom called
We answered as one
From hiding in the hills we entered the gripping sun

And how tall the grass grew
He wrote of the poppy fields
He said, ""tell the children I love them--remember""

There was a poppy
Kept in a frame
By his photograph
The years were so long
They were strong and we must be too

I could have touched your hand
I see your picture now

Automatically I think of you

You beginning and you to end
You were the first you never bend
You walk beside me everywhere I go
Our secret's safe they'll never know
But here we are walking on down Electric avenue
Part of today in every way Electric avenue

I'm insecure and I'm not so sure
Cause you mean this much to me
Your heart is cold and you won't grow old
I'm full of tricks so watch and see
I can disappear without a trace

Take a chance while I can
Not one also ran

Chorus:

I'm on a flight and its taking me closer
Home to a heart that's been left for so long
Time is all that holds me now
And the days have come and gone while I have flown
I'm coming home

I've read your letters, heard of your success
Does that mean happiness? Yes or no?
Temptation that lay across your path
Is it to much to ask to think of me?

I had to fight to be right
There was never a champion for me
Knights in armour don't exist
It's been such a risk

To search to find
Hear the voices speaking to me

What is happening to me?
Another no name tragedy

Majik (the children are close at hand)

Once so long ago I'd explain
Each feeling clear
Now the thoughts they dance and they weave
To disappear
It's Majik, it's tragic

What is happening to me?
Another lost game lost to me
Majik (have the rights to resist)
Majik (before it takes to the wrist)

Surround yourself in a cloak of stars
This must be heaven
You've held to answer the early hours
They have been given to you

What is happening to me?
Another lost game lost to me
What is happening to me?
Lost in twilight memories

It's like they'd never existed, strange but true
As sure as I'm talking to you
Now you see it, now I don't want to frighten you
But I'm simply here standing alone

Chorus I:

Trapped in these shadows that belong to missing persons
Names faded from memory join the list and then mark time
Once I would have been glad to have made your acquaintance
Now I feel a danger brought about by circumstance

Obsessed, the quality of life escapes me now
It's one of the things I lack
From the east and to the west
I feel it's time that I was heading back

I can't control these feelings that I have
I've never been one to hide
Become a pillar of society
But don't let your morals slide

Chorus II:

Or you can find that you've become a missing person
A here today gone tomorrow breeze and lost in the night
Once I would have been glad to have made your acquaintance
Now I feel a danger brought about by circumstance

But I know in the end, I'll be safe, we'll be happy
After finding myself we'll be fine
Any problems we have will be gone in a moment
I'll become just a state of the mind

I want you close
I need you near
You have to be here
I turned around
You've gone again

Through the valleys, feel the pressure drop

Renaissance,"Deep in the past there lived a man whose story must be told
Of royal descent but not of the royal line, oh oh

No history book relates this night of indiscretion
Into the world he's brought, never to be presented at court
In his mind a king though his mother wasn't wearing a ring
She keeps on saying:

""What they gonna do with Richard, Richard The Ninth?
You know he's my son, and the thought of it cuts like a knife
To think he'll ever sit upon the throne
A prince without a home
What we gonna do with Richard, Richard The Ninth
The least that we could do is to provide for his life
No job could have a stranger pedigree
He means so much to me!""

As Richard grew, he won the hearts of all the people
His father reigned, and while the servants poured, wo-oh

The lady waits and watches with anticipation
Ways of the world he's taught
The eyes of the queen he has caught
Midnight matinees soon become the order of play
She keeps on saying:

""What we gonna do with Richard, Richard The Ninth?
You know he's my son and the daughter, the queen, is his wife
Becomes the answer to my fantasy
He means the world to me""

""What we gonna do with Richard, Richard The Ninth?
It seems a night of love, in the end turned out right
One day I know he'll sit upon the throne
A prince no more alone""

Trees that stand look straight ahead
And search for a sight of distant land

In your heart you felt the cold and rain
Change the wind to silence
There's not a sound
Silver patterns run and dance
Upon the ground

Renaissance,"I took a trip down to look at the fair.
When I arrived I found nobody there.
It seemed I was all alone,
Must be that they've all gone home.

[Chorus]
A trip to the fair but nobody was there.
A trip to the fair but nobody was there.

Voices of yesterday make not a sound,
Even the roundabout stopped going 'round.
I wonder just what it means,
Is everything how it seems?

[Chorus]

A creak, as the dodgems came onto the scene.
Wheels began turning I started to scream.
A carousel swung around,
My head spun and hit the ground.

[Chorus]

I close my eyes to disguise the fear from inside,
Trembling within my own mind, I find no place to hide.
Stars of tomorrow shine through the grey mist that has gone.
I wish that this trip to the fair had never begun.

Suddenly thousands of faces I see,
Everyone seemed to be staring at me.
Clowns laughed in the penny arcade,
What was this game my mind played?

I took a trip down to look at the fair,
When I arrived I found nobody there.
It seemed I was all alone,
Must be that they've all gone home.

Renaissance,"I can hear Brazilian love songs, more every day
They seem stronger on the wind--you don't seem so far away
Someday I'm going to be there, someday I'll be
Standing on your highest mountain looking out across the sea

No longer here so cold and tired
I'm getting out today from Ukraine ways

From my childhood I've seen pictures, don't say a word
Decadent scenes of smiling people half the way across the world
When you live each day in colours of stone and gray
Feelings start to rise within you--steal the chance and get away

Much stronger now, I feel so inspired
I'm getting out today from Ukraine ways

I can feel your rhythm deep within me
I can see your people dance
Here I stand in the ice and snow
Warm where the cold winds blow

Colours that flash through my mind when I'm dreaming
Soon will be seen with these eyes of my own
Tropical days are the things that I live for
No more Ukraine ways

You hid from shadows in the attics of the world
Sheltered the truth, it grew and at last your voice was heard
The pen was your sword, you've even been called, another writer wronged
Fame suits you well, you hardly can tell, you're another writer wronged

Here I sit as we dine at the country club
I am wondering what to do now
I can write but it doesn't seem logical

Life is blase, this is how I pass my day
With friends as yet, some of which I've never met

I thought I was in control
I was not involved
I thought there's no hassle

I walk towards you and I find just shadow
Where did you go?

I remember all the things we used to do together
In the past

I wonder if there was some ... something neglected ...
Something left unsaid, hasty words instead

It seems nothing was ever right
I'm haunted by lost chances past

I can never love again

If I had known it all somehow

I could have held my shattered dream
Seen all the things I should have seen
Now I know love lies
Now I know love is bound to die
So much love now gone just slipped away
So much pain to see that love betrays
I will never love again
For love lies and it will die in the end

But now I know that love just lies
Leaving me hollow
Nothing to follow
So I will never give me heart
And I will always stand apart
Now I know love lies
Now I know love is bound to die
And love was nothing but a need
Devoured by an empty greed
The ashes fill my empty heart

Renaissance,"Is it right that it should be this good
I'm feeling changes all the time 

A special kind of beat I feel
Makes my pulse race, makes me reel
It spins me round and upside down, I feel the power
The turning of my life is measured by the hour
You make my day

Lucky is as lucky does
And thanks to you I fell in love
I tumble down not knowing what I came here for
It seemed my plans were always kept behind closed doors
You hold the key and unlocked me

[Chorus 1]
Is it that it should be this good
I'm feeling changes all the time
Early morning calls me back
I wake in another world that others seem so hard to find 
Make the most of what you have
Dancing time in rhythm pulls
You keep supplying energy
You're the body machine
They wish they could be like you
A perfect balance rarely seen

It's a dream
You've waited for so very long
I took the chance I made you strong
I grow with you, you saw in me potential fire
And when I thought the peak was reached, you took me higher
You held the key that unlocks me

Is it right it should be this good
I'm feeling changes all the time
Early morning calls me back
I wake in another world that others seem so hard to find

Acting like a little child
Could you love her if only for a while

Longs to be just where you are
You're the dreamaker
Please don't forsake her
She's only living for today
Don't you take her breath away

Evening falls, buy a ticket to your dream
Watching lovers play their part
Could she be just another lonely heart

Hid from shadows of the light
How she cries for you at night
Fame and fortune calls her name
She'll let you steal her heart away

The days before I knew your face
There must have been a night when I would miss your light
Beside me in that lonely space

There's no beginning and no end
The colours and the faces blend
Rain and the sunshine send, no beginning and no end
People and places blend, no beginning and no end

There must have been a day before you came my way
I saw the space you were to fill
I just can't find the change, the things love rearranged
I love you now, I always will

There's no beginning and no end
The music and the pictures blend
Echoes and voices said, no beginning and no end
Good and the sad times led, no beginning and no end

And as the sun will rise
And so the sun will set again
So we will turn and then
There's no beginning and no end

There's no beginning and no end
The colours and the faces blend

Rain and the sunshine send, no beginning and no end
People and places blend, no beginning and no end
Echoes and voices said, no beginning and no end
Good and the sad times led, no beginning and no end

No beginning, no end ...

Renaissance,"Sitting here alone my thoughts of you
I hold your photograph
It's simple black and white
You wear that smile that won my heart

The time we had was short
You had somewhere else to go
The drafty waiting room
The train pulls in, you go

[Chorus]
You ask me if it hurts when I think of you
It's only when I laugh
Time heals now I am cried out
A brief encounter deep in France
A table set for two
Hands held, I melt into you

I wrote some letters to old friends
The good old days
I didn't know you then
To mention you to them would be absurd
But then you mean so much

Ice that's on my window panes
Slowly starts to thaw
The image of my tears reflects on you
That's all

[Chorus]

My days will pass as years
Till you return to me

The reason that it hurts when I think of you
It's only when I laugh
Time heals and now I am cried out
A brief encounter deep in France
A table set for two
Hands held, I melt into you

Renaissance,"There is an island
Where it should never be
Surrounded by suburban sea
And through the tired and hopeless waves
To where it's free

[Chorus]
I want to be there
For the rest of my time

There on the island
The sun is always bright
The moon sends the darkness away in the night
I know that it's waiting
I know there's a place ready for me

[Chorus]

Warm sounds of wind songs
Come down through the trees
But far away tears are borne on the breeze
I'll follow the raindrops
Cause sunshine and smiles are waiting for me

Renaissance,"The first time ever she saw him,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
He passed on worried and warning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night,
Far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through.
The trees that whisper in the evening,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun,
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.
Four a.m. in the morning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
I watched your vision forming,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Stars roll slowly in a silvery night,
Far away on the other side.
Will you come to terms with me this night,
But she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.
Far away on the other side.
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five.
The night was heavy and the air was alive,
But she couldn't find how to push through.
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Far away on the other side.
But she couldn't find how to push through.",Moonlight Shadow

Des sphères en plastique qu'on retourne sans fin
Pour voir une Tour Eiffel sous une neige imbécile
Elle alliait le pas beau au franchement inutile

Mais elle était fière de ces trucs qui n'servent à rien
Elle aimait les sourires devant son magasin
Qu'une enseigne au néon appelait ""Chez Charlotte""
C'était son prénom mais je l'appelais Camelote

Quand j'n'avais rien à faire, j'lui donnais un coup d'main
Je lui tenais l'échelle pour prendre un nain d'jardin
A force de pouponner ses statues en terre cuite
On a voulu s'marier ici et tout de suite

Une pancarte sur la porte ""Fermé pour cause mariage""
On a choisi le nain qui semblait le plus sage
Pour jouer le rôle du maire et en guise de témoins
Deux fleurs qui dansent le jerk quand on tape des mains

Un diplôme certifié de la meilleure maman
Servira de registre quand viendra le moment
Nous seront signataires avec un stylo plume
Qui fait de la lumière sur ""Au clair de la lune""

Elle m'a dit ""Pour quoi faire"" 
J'ai répondu ""Pour rien!""

L'air du temps, les souvenirs
Le vécu
On y vient parce que l'on y boit
On laisse pour ce que l'on voit
Un écu

Ceux qui entrent sans savoir apportent
Et laissent à l'heure où ils sortent

Qui adhèrent aux murs et aux meubles
Semblent partir et puis veulent
Y rester

Desservis

Qui promène son opinel

Servent à combler ma tristesse

Laisserai-je des traces ?
Moi aussi, moi aussi !
C'est pourquoi j'occupe mes loisirs
A graver partout ""I was here""

Des traces de premiers rendez-vous
Ceux qui donnent le rose aux joues
Et des paupières
Battant l'air comme des papillons
Soulevant dans un tourbillon
La poussière

Tout cela se propage et donne
Peut-être pas un cyclone
Jusqu'en Chine
Mais laisse dans l'air alentour

Nous collions déjà nos chewing-gums
Sous les chaises
Plus tard les premières galoches
Et l'addition sur l'écorce
D'un vieux chêne

N'éviteront pas les vacances
Eternelles
Mais ces cœurs et rectangles
Sont un peu notre langue
Maternelle

Une heure sur le dos deux sur la tranche
J'essaie un rêve puis le rature
Passe par toutes les températures

Mes yeux ouverts cartographient
Grâce au diodes de la chaîne hi-fi
La moindre trace sur le mur
Que laissent les défauts de peinture

Une quinte de toux que je simule
Mais pour t'empêcher de me fausser

Tu diras, culot inouï

Mais la porte des souvenirs reste toujours entrebâillée 

Alors j'ai pris un bout de craie 
Et sur le sol 
J'ai dessiné quelques grands traits 
Pour qu'il recolle 
Ses souvenirs qui foutaient le camp

Là bas le piano de maman 
Ici mon lit

Remplit un sac 
Il me chuchote ""faut qu'tu t'rendormes""

Renan Luce,"Ah! Les secrets chuchotés 
S’envolent dans le souffle 
C’est là qu’ils s’emmitouflent 
C’est là qu’ils sont cachés 
Ces petits siroccos 
S’évaporent quand ils passent 
On ne met en bocaux 
Aucune messe basse 
Ça ne laisse pas de traces 

Sauf sur la pointe des pieds 
Tout contre mon oreille 
Quand t’accompagnes d’un baiser 
Le chemin que se fraye 
En un bruit de grillons 
Tes secrets que j’écoute 
J’y fais bien attention 
Je sais combien il coûte 
D’en verser une goutte 

Aussi lourds soient-ils 
Profondément enfouis 
Les secrets volatils 
En tombant à l’ouïe 
Passent d’une tonne 
À un tout petit poids 
De celui qui le donne 
À celui qui l’reçoit 

Ah! Tes secrets chuchotés 
Quand tu me les déposes 
Continuent à flotter 
Il reste quelque chose 
En parlant en sourdine 

Il y a dans le silence 
Un parfum qui chemine 
Dont je garde l’essence 
Qui dit «je te fais confiance» 

Aussi lourds soient-ils 
Profondément enfouis 
Les secrets volatils 
En tombant à l’ouïe 
Passent d’une tonne 
À un tout petit poids 
De celui qui le donne 
À celui qui l’reçoit 

Et tant que tu me l’accordes 
Je veux bien faire l’éponge 
À ton coeur qui déborde 
Aux torrents que tu longes 
Devenir Don Quichotte 
Du moulin à paroles 
Que tu es quand tu chuchotes 
Toutes ces petites bricoles 
Que moi je rafistole 

Aussi lourds soient-ils 
Profondément enfouis 
Les secrets volatils 
En tombant à l’ouïe 
Passent d’une tonne 
À un tout petit poids 
De celui qui le donne 
À celui qui l’reçoit 
À celui qui l’reçoit

Renan Luce,"J'ai libéré mes deux mains prises 
Doigts engourdis 
En reposant nos deux valises 
Sur le tapis 
Nous les laissons au bon vouloir 
D'un bagagiste 
On est légers dans les couloirs 
Qui mènent aux pistes 
En passant sous un détecteur 
Puisqu'il sonnait 
T'as trouvé dans ta robe à fleurs 
Un peu de monnaie 
Cool le hublot tu me le laisse 
Tu m'connais bien 
J'aime voir les nuages qu'on transperce 
Ça leur fait rien 
Ça leur fait rien

Tu ne regardes jamais en l'air 
Quand on s'ballade 
Tu vas là où y'a d'la poussière 
Là où c'est crade 
Tu dis qu'une ville pour qu'on arrive 
A la comprendre 
Il y voir les chats qui y vivent 
Dans ses méandres 
Les murs peints à la bombe 
Sont tes musées 

Et au café qui surplombe 
Des toiles usées 
La place face aux fenêtre je te la laisse 
Je te connais bien 
T'aime voir la foule qui se presse 
Qui va qui vient 
Qui va qui vient

Quand tu marchande 
Pour qu'on te laisse tes Ray Ban 
De contrebande 
Passer sous un détecteur 
Il a sonné 
J'avais dans ma poche intérieure 
Remis mes clefs 
Cool le hublot tu me le laisse 
Tu m'connais bien 
J'aime tant voir Paris qui se dresse

Renascer Praise,"No caminho eu vi pedras e ruína
Desertos intermináveis
Me fizeram chorar, me fizeram secar
Procurando milagre, esperando água
Cansado, eu quis parar

Meu coração não se engana
É minha fé que me sustenta
Esse deserto não diz quem eu sou
Eu sou um filho, eu sou prova do Teu grande amor

Meu caminho, rocha e salvação

Renata Artman Knific,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much

Renata Friederich,"Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
'Neath the cover of October skies

And all the leaves on the trees are fallin'
To the sound of the breezes that blow
An' I'm trying to please to the callin'
Of your heart strings that play soft and low

And all the nights magic seems to whisper and hush
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush
Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

Well, I wanna make love to you tonight
I can't wait 'til the morning has come
And I know now the time is just right
And straight in to my arms you will run

And when you come, my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you're never alone
There and then, all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then, I will make you my own

And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside
And I know how much you want me that you can't hide
Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

Renata Tebaldi,"""Ave Maria! Jungfrau mild,
Erhöre einer Jungfrau Flehen,
Aus diesem Felsen starr und wild
Soll mein Gebet zu dir hinwehen.
Wir schlafen sicher bis zum Morgen,
Ob Menschen noch so grausam sind.
O Jungfrau, sieh der Jungfrau Sorgen,
O Mutter, hör ein bittend Kind!Ave Maria!
Ave Maria! Unbefleckt!
Wenn wir auf diesen Fels hinsinken
Zum Schlaf, und uns dein Schutz bedeckt
Wird weich der harte Fels uns dünken.
Do lächelst, Rosendüfte wehen
In dieser dumpfen Felsenkluft,
O Mutter, höre Kindes Flehen,
O Jungfrau, eine Jungfrau ruft!
Ave Maria!
Ave Maria! Reine Magd!
Der Erde und der Luft Dämonen,
Von deines Auges Huld verjagt,
Sie können hier nicht bei uns wohnen,
Wir woll'n uns still dem Schicksal beugen,
Da uns dein heil'ger Trost anweht;
Der Jungfrau wolle hold dich neigen,
Dem Kind, das für den Vater fleht.
Ave Maria!""
Hope that helps.",Ave Maria
Renata Tebaldi,"Dormi, dormi
Sogna, piccolo amor mio
Dormi, sogna
Posa il capo sul mio cor

Mille cherubini in coro
Ti sorridono dal ciel
Una dolce canzone
T'accarezza il crin
Una man ti guida lieve
Fra le nuvole d'or

It dreams, small amor
Sognando e vegliando
Su te, mio tesor
Proteggendo il tuo cammin
Su te, mio tesor
Proteggendo il tuo cammin

Dormi, sogna
Posa il capo sul mio cor

You sleep, you sleep, dreams, small amor mine
You sleep, it dreams, it puts down the head on mine cor
Thousand cherubs in chorus sorridono to you from the ciel
One sweet song t' caress crin One man guides to you 
Light between clouds of or, dreamming and being awake on you
Mine tesor, proteggendo yours cammin. On you, mine tesor
Proteggendo yours cammin. You sleep, you sleep, dreams
Small amor mine You sleep, it dreams
It puts down the head on mine cor
You close the eyes, listens to the angioletti
You sleep, you sleep, dreams, small amor
You sleep, you sleep, dreams, small amor mine
You sleep, it dreams, it puts down the head on mine cor
You close the eyes, listens to the angioletti, you sleep

Renato & Seus Blue Caps,"Quero saber de toda a realidade
Se você ama outro rapaz na verdade
Não pense que eu já não notei a diferença
Com que você diz meu amor
Há muito tempo eu já venho notando
Sua frieza quando está me beijando

Não faça assim meu bem que eu já estou tão magoado
Não há motivo pra me torturar assim
Não me conformo em saber que você nem sequer se lembrou
Das horas tristes e belas que juntos passamos
E que hoje acabou

Não é preciso se fingir comovida
Eu já espero a hora da despedida
Não ligue se eu chorar é que estou apaixonado
E muito triste em me separar de ti",Despedida
