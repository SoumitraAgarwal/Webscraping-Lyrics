The Lemonheads,"Always had a roof above me 
Always paid the rent
But I've never set foot inside a tent
Can't build a fire to save my life
I lied about being the outdoor type

I've never slept out underneath the stars,
The closest that I came to that was one time my car
Broke down for an hour in the suburbs at night
I lied about being the outdoor type.

Too scared to let you know you knew what you were looking for
I lied until I fit the bill god bless the great indoors
I lied about being the outdoor type
I've never owned a sleeping bag let alone a mountain bike

I can't go away with you on a rock climbing weekend
What if somethings on tv and its never shown again
Its just as well I'm not invited I'm afraid of heights
I lied about being the outdoor type

Never learned to swim can't grow a beard or even fight
I lied about being the outdoor type",The Outdoor Type
The Lemonheads,"It's no trick to decide on your own
You feel it when you feel fine later on
A shower you can't depend on at all
It's too hot then it's too cold then it's warm
Something's missing something's missing
Something's missing something's missing
From my life
The things I don't multiply and divide when
I just can't decide been here before
It's gonna come back again been here before
It's gonna come back my friend
Something's missing something's missing
Something's missing something's missing
From my life
I ain't quiet deep inside I ain't even on my side
Something's missing from my life
There's nowhere I really wanted to stay and
Nothing really makes it ok
Nothing really makes it ok
There's nowhere I really wanted to stay
Something's missing something's missing
Something's missing",Something's Missing
The Lemonheads,"This is the spot of where I jump off
This is the place I wear the save face 
This is the bar of where I lose heart
Over the pain and I'm past the bleeding 
Its not the tracks its where they're leading
This my best king carnivore
This is my scream its just a dull roar
These are my hands I've shown you before
Over the pain and I'm past the bleeding
Its not the tracks its where they're leading
Hasn't been so bad yet I'll do it again
Error of my ways, maybe one of these days",Tenderfoot
The Lemonheads,"There's a girl I know, she's the one I dream of
Look into her eyes, takes me to the clouds above
Yes I lose control, I can't seem to get enough whoa
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love?

Tell me how will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know if she really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
Falling in love is so bittersweet
I'm asking you 'cos you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I try to phone but I'm too shy, can't speak
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, I wish I had you near me now whoa
Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love

Ooh how will I know
Don't trust your feelings, how will I know?
How will I know?
Those things they can be deceiving
How will I know?
How will I know if he's thinking of me
I say a prayer with every heartbeat",How Will I Know [Electric]
The Lemonheads,"I haven't cried baby since I learned to talk
Haven't fallen down since I learned to walk
And I don't get bored watching the tube
And I never had a rock in my shoe

And if I tried baby, would you mess me 'round?
Would we both get bored by the simple sound

Sorry about dropping that lude
It just seemed like the best thing to do

It's all true
I got me
She's got you
And we got time to share a few

You never get me down when I'm feeling blue
When I tell you lies you won't believe they're true
Now I really should be on my way
Think I'm gonna stick around all day

It's all true
I got me
She's got you
And we got time to share a few

She's so precise with her exacto knife
She's gonna take her life

I don't wake up with a sudden start
With some empty arms and a broken heart
And I don't get bored watching the tube.",It's All True
The Lemonheads,"Take a look into some big grey eyes and ask yourself
You wanna make 'em cry?
Lookin' out of them it's just as well
But you're gonna live to see I'm gonna ask you why

Either way you got a bone to pick, can't you leave that to somebody else?
I don't need you to suck my dick or to help me feel good about myself

Big gay heart, please don't break my big gay heart
Big gay heart, please don't break my big gay heart

Why can't you look after yourself and not down on me?
Do you have to try to piss me off 'cause I'm easy to please?
Why can't you look after yourself and not down on me?
Yeah while I understand now you're not with the big gay scene

If you can find a way to add it up,
It might be hard but it might be enough
I'd be grateful, I'd be satisfied,
And you might find in time it wouldn't feel so bad
After all it doesn't take that much and it would mean the song to me
For you to lose the part that's still afraid and not prepared to see

My big gay heart
In the dark, my big gay heart
Big gay heart, please don't break my big gay heart

Why can't you look after yourself and not down on me?
Do you have to try to piss me off just 'cause I'm easy to please?
Why can't you look after yourself and not down on me?
Yeah while I understand now you're not with the big gay scene

The Lemonheads,"That pencil smell
Reminds me of school
The clock on the wall
I can no longer fool

Time to get in my car
Been so dull, tired, and tight
Time to trust these old tires
Time to not say goodnight

Jesus rides with me
His will is plain to feel
Come on, you can be
Got yourself to steal

He's everywhere
Sends me straight across the plain
He's in your hair
He'll forgive me my pain

You're my girl, don't you show it
To know you know is to know it
When you can't trust yourself
Baby, trust someone else

The Lemonheads,"Got me watching your eyes watching things go by outside
Out the window of a train
Easy sipping them just seeing it fly left to right
Pour the milk and I'll say when

I'm out wandering around.
You're but one thing I've found.
I don't mean to bring you down.
I'm out wandering around.

Kinda hoped you wouldn't blame me
I can`t wake up every day and find the same me
You can scream but I'll just dream how you might disappear
All I know is it's never clear

I can't hold you near.
You just are not here.
Though it wasn't hard or far.
I walked you to your car.",Hannah and Gabi
The Lemonheads,"My indecision is causing me pain
It's hard to conceal it
And it's harder to name
Before I leave for work
Here's some words that might hurt
But it's something that I have to say

Think about me, when he calls around three
The time that you know I'm not at home
All that I ask is our promises last
'Til the time I can stand on my own

When I horse breaks a leg
Then it's best to shoot it
Cause it's quick and it eases the pain
But when a marriage is dying
Tell me who does the firing
And who is to say who's to blame

Think about me, when he calls around three
The time that you know I'm not at home
All that I ask is our promises last
'Til the time I can stand on my own

You may think I went to work
But I took the day off
And I watched him as his car pulled in the drive
And although my heart's hurtin'
My shotgun is workin'
And it packs one hell of a surprise

Think about me, when he calls around three
Cause guess what your baby is home
I'll cut you in half with a double shot blast
And I'll pound on his head with a stone
'Til I think I can stand on my own",Baby's Home
The Lemonheads,"It's dawned on me again 
I can't balance in betweens 
It's no longer familiar to me 
It's become routine 

The bedroom ritual 
A simple way to feel 
Without running the risk of anything real 
Ever being given, ever being shown 
Back in the bedroom no backbone 

Standards I kept, in the back of my mind 
Are now just rules I break from time to time 
I'm way past worrying about it getting a hold of me 
I realize I ride on it's back for free 

The bedroom ritual 
A simple way to feel 
Without running the risk of anything real 
Ever being given, ever being shown 
Back in the bedroom no backbone 

Predictably I'll stick to the safety of the script 
But I know I'll end up settling for a less than perfect fit

The Lemonheads,"Every day is so wonderful and suddenly I saw debris
Now and then I get insecure from all the pain
I'm so ashamed

I am beautiful, no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful, in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down, whoa no
So don't ya bring me down today

To all your friends, you're delirious, 
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness, the piece is gone
Left the puzzle undone, cuz that's the way it is

The Lemonheads,"Floating on the air
Never seemed to care
Worries have they none
See them drift upon the breeze
Dandelion seeds

Blow them and they're gone
Fly up to the sun
Come be with me
Where the air is always clean

I tell the time for you

The Lemonheads,"Tears fall in slivers,
You broke my shades,
The light too bright,
Let me bury my heart.

Filter emotions of greens,
Cowardice gives blue,
A restricted view,
Let me open my heart.

I have a fleeting love,
Scorching when it lands,
Fragile,
Needing precious hands,
Fragile.

You eat my energy,
Give me more rope,
Nail in the wall,
Let me hang my heart.

I have a fleeting love,
Scorching when it lands,
Fragile,
Needing precious hands,
Fragile.",Fragile
The Lemonheads,"I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm,
Your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm,
Yes, many loved before us, I know that we are not new,
In city and in forest they smiled like me and you,

But now it's come to distances and both of us must try,
Your eyes are soft with sorrow,
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.
I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time,

Walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme
You know my love goes with you as your love stays with me,
It's just the way it changes, like the shoreline and the sea,
But let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie,

Your eyes are soft with sorrow,
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.

The Lemonheads,"I've been thinkin' back on it, babe
I guess it's been useless after all
I'm tired of seein' all the days goin' by
Tearin' the numbers off my wall

You've been taking up my time and steppin' out-a line
And breakin' up the dreams I had before
And I just can't make it anymore
No, I just won't take it anymore

You said once before you were lookin' for a friend
Who'd take the time to really get to know you
But you wanted me to kneel and forgot that I was real
And I guess I'm not per chance that far below you

You've been shakin' up my bed and breaking up my head
So I'm wakin' up an turning in my score
And I just can't make it anymore
No, I just won't take it anymore

And I just can't make it anymore
No, I just won't take it anymore",I Just Can't Take It Anymore
The Lemonheads,"Sometimes I don't know where this dirty road is taking me
Sometimes I can't even see the reason why
I guess I keep on gamblin', lots of booze and lots of ramblin'
It's easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die

One-time friends I had a ma, I even had a pa
He beat her with a belt once cause she cried
She told him to take care of me, she headed down to Tennessee
It's easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die

I came of age and found a girl in a Tuscaloosa bar
She cleaned me out and hit it on the sly
I tried to kill the pain, I bought some wine and hopped a train
Seemed easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die

A friend said he knew where some easy money was
We robbed a man and brother did we fly
The posse caught up with me, drug me back to Muskogee
It's two long years, just a-waitin' 'round to die

Now I'm out of prison, I got me a friend at last
He don't steal or cheat or drink or lie
His name's codeine, he's the nicest thing I've seen
Together we're gonna wait around and die",Waiting Around to Die

Today I'll go on my way to love my yester love oh oh

Bear tracks bear tracks're lookin' back at me
You better get your rifles boy before it's too late

The Lennon Sisters,"Away in a manger, no crib for his bed,
the little Lord Jesus laid down his Sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,

But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.

And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

Not one ribbon for her hair.

Came those lovely scarlet ribbons,

The role I was about to play ?

Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces

Talk about God in His mercy
Who if He really does exist
Why did He desert me ?
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed

Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?  What do we do?

And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away

no way to speak
I would still hear you
If there were no tears
no way to feel inside
I'd still feel for you
and even if the sun refused to shine
even if romance ran out of rhyme
you would still have my heart
until the end of time
you're all I need, my love, my valentine

All of my life
I have been waiting for
all you give to me
you've opened my eyes
and showed me how to love unselfishly

I've dreamed of this a thousand times before
but in my dreams I couldn't love you more
I will give you my heart
untill the end of time
you're all I need, my love, my valentine

The Lettermen,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Windmills of Your Mind [From the Thomas Crown Affair]

Put her hand in mine and said she loved me so
But that was once upon a time, very long ago

Once upon a time, we sat beneath the willow tree
Counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn
But that was once upon a time, now the tree has gone

How the breeze ruffled through her hair
How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there

Where did it go?

Everything was ours, how happy we were then
But, somehow, once upon a time never comes again",Once Upon a Time

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

The clouds rolling by the last days of winter
Now seem so far away and everything looks green
When it used to be gray and I've watched the change

Like the changing in my mind and I chased the leaves
Like the words I never find, like the people I knew
Who I sometimes see today some still bright like fire
And some faded away

I turn on the radio and someone's playing a song
I turn on the news, hear what's going on
I turn on my back when I'm full of beer
And I turn off the news when I don't want to hear

And I've seen a girl who looks so very sad
Nothing left but a memory of all the times she's had
And I've seen a man who looks so sad inside
Nothing left but the memories from which he cannot hide

So I learned to fight with a weapon called the word
And I learned to rise my voice so that I'd be heard
And I learned to fight with a weapon called the word
And I learned to raise my voice but I've never been heard

The Levellers,"I never was a violent man 
Said the man in the bar with his head in his hands
Trying his best to understand the cause of his dismay 
But years of gin have broken him 
And left him cold where he fitted in
It's too late to turn around and find another way

All the lights in the late night lock-in
Fade away when he gets in
And the girl from fifteen years ago
Has packed and gone away
She said it'll never be what it used to be 
What happened to all that energy
You took too many liberties, and I'm tired of being afraid 
So night after night she took flight
Hiding swollen eyes and a wounded pride
The best years of her life denied, sold for liquid shares 

[Chorus:] 
The victims of this world, are advertised on posters
A beach and a pretty girl, if you just drink their potion
It's another week 'til his cheque comes through
He's got a fiver left to spend on food
But the doors of the bar are open, and he breaks another rule
He sits on the stool that bears his name
His favorite glass is called the same 
And he's never kept waiting, 'cause he pays the landlord's wage",15 Years
The Levellers,"Dance before the storm
These are dangerous time we live in
I heard a man once say
If you're prone to flights of fancy
Your dreams can fly away

See the sights around you
Of breakdown and decay
Wrought by the greed for a better life
For which you have to pay

From Glasgow town to London
Down the motorway
There's people standing in the rain
Looking for any way

To take them down to where they're bound
It's a part of another way
It's called the art of survival
In a modern age

Dance before the storm
Don't look back to where you've been
The horror's even further
As the sands of time run thin

Dance before the storm
As the machinery breaks down
Watch the sky go black with anger
But no one makes a sound

From Albion Hill to the Old Chain Pier
You can hear a person say
Spare some change for all me pains
So if your head spins round, go underground

Away from the games they play
People down there are trying to care
And let each one have their say

It's not revolution tactics
Or cause for anarchy
Just a natural fight for a natural life
Of which systems are afraid

And if it all surrounds you
Seems like there's no escape
And there's someone stood in front of you
Saying do it in their way

Turn your eyes towards the tides
See how they never change
The sands of time will break their mime
Like riding on a wave

",Dance Before the Storm
The Levellers,"I met you in 82, over a crate of beer and not a few 
I cracked a can and so did you, we're going to change the world 
The ghetto kings of downside town-the estates and parks of our hallowed ground 
Doing anything that we found, and on the river flowed 

You'd take a drink from Rev. Jimmy Jones
You'd cross the street on the path the gunman roams 
Thrown aside and left to waste, that was you - you knew your place 
Wander round, get off your face, and on the river flowed

On and on the river flow - we are the undertow 
On and on the river flow - we are the undertow 

I don't know how you made it through all the smoke and brew you do 
It sure has left its mark on you but you're still with us today 
Life goes on and round we go and words can kill these things I know 
Sometimes you cut deeply so, but on the river flows

You'd set the table for barber Sweeney Todd 
You'd clip the wings of any rising god 
But man can't live on hope alone, it can be cut all that is grown
Broke your spirit but not your bones and on the river flows 

CHORUS 

You're working now - forced to the race 
I know it left a bitter taste 
But the rising tide had covered your face 
Nothing you could do 
But I still remember the day you said 
That the river flowing through my head 
Would take me far or leave me dead 
And all you said was true

are all the words his mother said
as she would put him to bed back home

your daddy died in the falklands 
fighting for another man's cause
and your brother he was killed in the last war
now your mother's lying at home alone

Every day she sees his face 
on the picture on the fireplace
with your brother as he was leaving school 
then a day came five years ago
you said ""mother, i need to know""
and you spoke the words your brother spoke before
""i know the things my daddy done
i've seen the medals thet he won
and i know that this is what he would have wanted-for me""

AND NOW SHE WONDERS AT IT ALL

Past the place where my friend died 
Two years ago

But the noise we thought would never stop
Died a death as the punks grew up
And we choked on our dreams
We wrestled with our fears 
Running through the heartless concrete streets
Chasing our ideas

And the problems of the world
Won't be solved by this guitar
And they won't stop coming either 
By the life I've had so far
And the bright lights of my home town
Won't be getting any dimmer 
Though their calling has receded now
Like some old distant singer
And they don't seem so appealing
To the eyes of this poor sinner

CHORUS",One Way
The Levellers,"I met you in eight two, over a crate of beer and not a few 
I cracked a can and so did you, we're going to change the world 
The ghetto kings of downside town-the estates and parks of our hallowed ground
Doing anything that we found, and on the river flowed 

You'd take a drink from Rev. Jimmy Jones 
You'd cross the street on the path the gunman roams 
Thrown aside and left to waste, that was you, you knew your place 
Wander round, get off your face, and on the river flowed

On and on the river flow, we are the undertow 
On and on the river flow, we are the undertow 

I don't know how you made it through all the smoke and brew you do
It sure has left its mark on you but you're still with us today
Life goes on and round we go and words can kill these things I know 
Sometimes you cut deeply so, but on the river flows 

You'd set the table for barber Sweeney Todd 
You'd clip the wings of any rising god 
But man can't live on hope alone, it can be cut all that is grown 
Broke your spirit but not your bones and on the river flows

On and on the river flow, we are the undertow 
On and on the river flow, we are the undertow 

You're working now, forced to the race I know it left a bitter taste
But the rising tide had covered your face 
Nothing you could do 
But I still remember the day you said 
That the river flowing through my head 
Would take me far or leave me dead 
And all you said was true",The Riverflow
The Levellers,"Headlights, white lights, black tar rivers
Dragging me around this country as it withers
The billboards, signposts, standing in the way 
Tell of the state of the nations, that we find today 

And we play and we play 
To every day, every day 
To every day

In the front rooms of old towns far from the city 
With beat up guitars and hearts full of pity 
The people gather round singing songs from everywhere 
Torn from the nation, left without a care 

And we play and we play 
To every day, every day 
To every day

And we'll rid the bloody world for a moment in a word 
And we'll rid the bloody world 'cause 
The words that you heard when you were young will always stay
The one's that always stay make the world go away 
The words that you heard when you were young will always stay
The one's that always stay make the world go away 
Go away

Warm night, clear sky, European town
Outside the bars singing their hearts out to a crowd 
Open boots, violin, banjo and a voice
The Exiled buskers,theyÂ´re happy with their choice

And we play and we play 
To every day, every day 
To every day 

And we'll rid the bloody world for a moment in a word 
And we'll rid the bloody world 'cause 
The words that you heard when you were young will always stay
The one's that always stay make the world go away 
The words that you heard when you were young will always stay
The one's that always stay make the world go away 
Go away

The Levellers,"Belaruse no longer feels the sun
But it's under the skin of everyone
Belaruse forgotten by the blind 
That is until the next time 

Remember all your yesterdays
In the deep blue 
Before the world came 
And rested there on you

And if the sun and moon 
Were both to doubt 
Then sure enough 
They'd both go out

'Bout the way the world's been left behind
In another place, in another time
We could maybe change the way we think 
Take the blinkers from our eyes 

Do you think that she was maybe not alone
Do you think there's someone out there
Do you think that they might know
And if they don't do you think they should be told 
'Cause she's living in a nightmare 
Running out of her control 

Take the rope
Take the blindfold from your eyes
Take the rope from 'round your neck 
And take the blindfold from your eyes

The Levellers,"There isn't much to gain
By living all the same way 
The years just slip away
But it's too late then to play

If you live from day to day 
You can play the game your own way 
There's a million things to say
In a million places

For her it stays the same 
Though a million towers have tumbled 
And you can hear her pain
Voiced in a distant rumble 

And when it starts to rain 
All your monoliths will crumble 
It's always been the same
Don't you feel a little bit humble? 

She came up to me, she said: 
'want to know a mystery? 
There's a whole wide world for you to see
You're just a player in the game'

Well I've nothing left to say
Except take the time to ramble
In a million different ways
There's a million paths to travel 

And when there's something in the way 
Take your time please remember 
There's hope yet in the rain
And a voice in distant thunder",The Player
The Levellers,"I never thought I'd see the day 
When you became what you've become
It's easy now just to look away
And leave your conscience on the run 
Spend so much time not looking for answers 
Someone else's to blame
As long as you don't take the drop 
To you it's all the same

Blood, sweat and tears
Really don't matter
Just the things that you do 
In this garden

Some time I like to get away
Chase a thought and fly 
The people here will never change 
They're too scared to look outside
Community spirit neighborhood watch 
Curtains twitching all the time 
Got to have a look at what next door's got
Cause your credit's on the line 

The other day I saw a fox
He was running for his life
His eyes were wide but his mind was shut
To the redcoat's bugle calls 
But when he got home his path was blocked
By some 'sportman's' clever guise 
And if this how far your culture's got
Then I deny it

The crackdown starts
The law descends and the nightmare starts again
Though they tighten the security net 
There's always one who gets away",This Garden

The Levellers,"The devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you 

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

He played Fire on the Mountain run boys, run
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in a bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No child, no

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back
If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been""

The Levellers,"Pushed from the start
Do it right and maybe you'll take a part
Call a spade a spade

Put on your blinkers maybe then you'll be made
To walk the streets
Head full of false facts you can't get back

But you wake up one day
You wake up one day
Can't see the world the same way
All the lights have changed

Your routine's down the drain
Things will never be the same
Some call it art
But it's hard to start

When you don't know the game
But if feels so good
To be understood
By yourself again

The Levellers,"All around you slow decay
Want to feel the sun of a new day
Forget all the chances lost
Shedding innocence like falling dust
All the things you learned too young 
The songs you knew but never sung 
Waited a long time and wasted more
Forgotten what you waited for

Excuse me ma'am for being so rude
Feels like 100 years of solitude
My mind is numb but my mouth's okay 
And you can listen or walk away

No solutions built to last
Just petty scores to settle fast 
The N.M.E. was nothing to you
And the maker, well the maker of who 
This walkman generation 
In search of sweet sedation 
While forests choke under a lever sky 
And the Exxon birds that will never fly

We tried, we cried, we fell, we lied
This life's like a white knuckled ride 
Crack babies born too young 
And L.A. kids who dance to the gun 
So forget this so called dirt of mine 
It's just the dust and diesel of passing time
It's all around you - a tragedy, look 
So forget the cover and read the book",100 Years of Solitude

They didn't find the land
For reasons of security
They couldn't get the plans 

And we're left standing watching from below 
No new songs and no new heroes
Standing on the sidelines watching the flow
Waiting till the day the circle's broken 

Took the mic to save day
The rock star's going to have his say
I interpret this in any way as if it matters
'cause nothing's black and nothing's white 
Nothing appears to be quite right 
It'll be this way until the day
The circle's shattered

I hear an old song yesterday
About a better world

Still at the stage of clubs and fists, hurah tada
When that well known face got beaten to bits, hurah tada

As we watched the speech of an animal scream
The new party army was marching right over our heads

There you are, ha ha, I told you so, hurah tada
Says everybody that we know, hurah tada

And who got caught out on their unawares
When that new party army came marching right up the stairs

When Johnny comes marching home again, hurah tada
Nobody understands this can happen again, hurah tada

The Levellers,"Wasting time at nowhere very special
Seems almost a part of it these days
I know every crack along the pavement
I remember what you said in '88 

You said: 'It's time to leave this town 
The world keeps turning 'round
The only thing that keeps me here is you' 
I'm drinking in the same bar where I met you 
Without you it wouldn't be the same
We talk for hours and hours 'bout different places 
You said that you would see them all some day 

You were always so good with words
The tales you told we've heard
The thing you said to me that day 
Will never fade in memory 
Time is unforgiving
You know that I won't make it without you

No matter just what window you look out of
The view just never ever seems to change
And I swear that we ain't getting any younger
But we'll chase all of our dreams all the same

So beautiful plain 
As fresh as the country 
That gave her her name 
As crips as the snow
And as swift as the rain

Before all of our games
She shone like a jewel
But her price was not gold 
She cired more than most 
When her story was told 
But her people were evil
Left her baron and cold 
And her heart went to market
Where her body was sold

I said : 'Hey, hey won't you take me away
Cos I can't see the point In the dawn of the day 
So many killers gonna take you away 
They'll leave nothing left except hatred'

The brave Southseastern hills 
Running like a madman on the moor
Let the sweet Atlantic rain
Wash away my youth

In the air around 
It's more than just a feeling
A different way of seeing 
A different kind of life
Something I believe in

But in amongst the city lights 
The feeling's not so clean
Neon lights and faceless signs
Hide what I hold dear
It's there to find if you have the mind 
And you don't live in fear of it

Of lifes that passed before

Stays with me as if I'd written every word

I thought I saw an open door 
With a bright light shining through
But what it was I don't recall
But I think you've seen it too
And there are the days and the ways I've known 
Dreaming that this bird has flown

And if you burnt your fingers in the fire
Remember me and my desire

It might be easier this way
If you're trying to change the world

I saw a film just made for me
Said you've got to walk the line

The Levellers,"Don't fall under temptation
If drinking for the nation
Is getting you down
'Cause it takes a lot of work

Filling up your belly
And eating dirt
It takes a lot of cash
And a lot of life to get this trash

But it's easier than paying
You tie it straight to the mouth
But it's easier than paying
You tie it straight to the mouth

Don't fall under temptation
If drinking for the nation
Is dragging you down
Your country needs you don't deny it

Drink all you can just don't get high
And if you feel it start to hurt
Just buy another
Say let's get worse

But it's easier than paying
You tie it straight to the mouth
But it's easier than paying
You tie it straight to the mouth

Don't fall under temptation
If drinking for the nation is getting you down
'Cause every penny that you spend
Goes to defend, the one you love

No, it's not mine if you haven't a drink
No pain no gain, hand in glove

Don't ever think if thinking brings you down
Don't ever think if thinking brings you down
Don't ever think if thinking brings you down

What a beautiful day (hey hey) 
I'm the king of all time
And nothing is impossible 
In my all powerful mind

It was the fifth of November, when time it went back
Some say that's impossible, but you and I never looked back
And wasn't it incredible, so beautiful and above all
Just to see the fuse get lit this time
To light the real bonfire, for all time

Chorus
I was drinking in the night club
It felt good to be back 
When Hepburn said I love you
And Flyn said, make mine a double jack
Then we planned the revolution 
To make things better for all time
And when the barman said that was crazy
And ordered up a bottle of wine

Chorus (x2)
In there on the big screen, every night I've seen
The way all things could be
For me, for me, etc........

(Chorus instrumental)
The news broke after midnight, 
That we pulled the temple down without a sound
But the generals they were hiding out
And the ministers, Well! They'd all gone to ground
Wealth re-distribution, became the new solution
So I got a paper bag, but you got the one with all the holes

The Levellers,"Oh there was once a man who had lost his own smile
And he wandered the country mile after mile
Never quite knowing what he wanted to find
For his heart it lay heavy with the weight of his mind

And he looked at the land through the tears in his eyes
For he knew that there were those who would will her to die
And he wept for his mother as he lay at her feet
And he heard a voice singing him softly to sleep

I'll be your queen, I'll be your mother, I'll be your mystical child
Be your best friend, your lover 
Your wife for all time
Will there ever be another, in this life of mine
Will there ever be another, like my mystical child
So he climbed a high hill and he looked out to sea
And he heard a voice calling out softly to him
Open your heart boy for it needs to be free
And the next time you're crying come running to me

So he walked through the valleys the trees and the fields
And he came to a river where she waited for him

And he heard a voice saying 'you're not alone in the fight'",Elation

Underneath the clear blue sky.

Nothing matters all the time.

The Levellers,"In the life in front of you and me
Seems there is no logic, no place that you must be
And there are times that it gets so hard to see

To find the valid reasons for the things that come to be
But you must try to set your spirit free
You know you cannot hide from spiritual disease
And it seems you cannot please the present company

Who could claim to know the answers
Is just the way we're meant to be
Love is stronger in survivors
Survivors follow destiny

If you like we could go down to the sea
We could watch the evening tide, catch the boat to Honalee
We could fly above the dark city

Gettin' higher in the sky with every breath you breathe
And if you cry about the things you leave
It's yourself you should be asking, about what you really need
And you know it is no lie for it only takes belief

Before you go on your way

It seems the world is a little busy
Selling lies on for a living
That in a blinking of an eye
The truth has slipped away

And the writings on the wall

And another love that went so wrong
And all the inside guts and glory
That pushed it all along

You just let the days go by, come what may
All the things that we should have done
Just happened anyway

And the writing written on the wall
For everyone to see

It lives on even though you think it's dead and gone
The legacy love leaves behinds was never easy, never kind
It lives on even though you think it's dead and gone

Truth turned into light
Men came in the night
And they set her world alight

Brighter in the night
Red sun burns
To make you feel alright

But everywhere you go
There's still not enough
For everyone

Tears lay in her eyes
She swore no one would take

The Levellers,"There's a man on the mountain
Who hides himself away
A voice on the wind there
Is telling him to stay

He knows on the outside
The world has looked away
From that night in the valley
When they took them all away

Now the rock of ages
Has broken at his feet
The history of centuries
Lies scattered down the street

The houses are all empty now
Left broken there to die
The children's playground
Burned and gone with no-one left to cry

Can you hear the sound of voices
Carried on the wind

Can you hear it
Can you hear the sound of voices
Carried on the wind

He drowned himself in sorrow
And he drowned himself in drink
He drowned himself in self-pity
Until it made him sick

He knew he was no master
Just a slave to himself
To the voices that have tortured him
That he'll take to his grave

Can you hear it
Can you hear the sound of voices
Carried on the wind

Can you hear it
Can you hear the sound of voices
Carried on the wind

Time passes slowly
Sometimes he's at a loss
And he wishes he could change it all
But you can't turn back the clock

He picks up the broken pieces
Of that so sacred rock
And he takes them to a safer place
Where they'll be forever lost

Can you hear the sound of voices
Carried on the wind

Living it so it can't be wrong 
'cause I was born the wrong way round

When you took me by the hand

That you 
Talk ever so lightly
Lately 
And you walk 
Ever so slowly

I didn't know and I didn't care
What there was that could catch your breath 
But a moment gone is a moment caught
And in half an hour I was taught 
That I didn't need to know this 
When you walked out of the night 

That you talk ever so lightly 
Lately
And you walk
Ever so slowly

I didn't move and I didn't breath 
To be there where you were
I didn't think 'cause I didn't know

Will be there when you are gone

A nd you walk
Ever so slowly

Half an hour's gone and we're still together 
Walking now beneath the weather
All the dreams, all the pains 
All that's come back again 
But we don't need to be there
When it comes on oh so low 

'cause you talk ever so lightly
Lately
And you walk 
Ever so slowly

Come on this time but not for us
To be there when we're gone
And all of the world and all of the days 
Are just half an hour long 
And all of the lives of all of the gods 
Will envy us our song

And the ship that you sailed now has gone
Without you, has left you all alone

Just don't panic 'cause I'm holding your life belt

But you were made as two
You were made to go on
You've forgotten what to do

So wake up now I'm begging you
You sleep and sleep on
It's all you ever do
Has your comfort now gone

When you look around the room
And remember the fire, the fire in you
The sleeping excuse that's all you ever do
And it's really no use

When there's so much left for us to do
Can you make some time
For what is always yours and mine

I've seen you stretched out on the line
Try and remember the truth
Without you we're all no use

The Lilac Time,"Hide your feelings
Hide from the postman
Or the night spent falling down
In the night
In Butcher town
The night spent crawling like a snail
On Black Velvet.

Found me a language
That talks without blackmail
Without words
I called for you
Without words
I called for you
And you answered like a kiss
On Black Velvet.

Bring me the sunshine
Bring me the ocean
To its knees

And we walked softly
Like snow so silent under foot

The Lilac Time,"The light dissolves the darkness
For sleepy she
The day unwraps the night ties
And we can see

The sunbeam blinds the moonbeam
And morning disagrees
And with panic before dream-time
Overcome

Your body lies before me
Goose pimplean
That shivers to my fingers
As I touch

The hairs below your stomach
And slowly in between
Oh, how slowly can I stay here?
And never yet too much

And if you get married
You'll find out that it's true
Love becomes a savage
Who's going to savage you

I want a farm of kisses
On your lips
Planted with best wishes
A mouthful of sips

I know every crevice
And I know every kiss
And what tastes have been before me
And which ones you will miss

",Love Becomes a Savage
The Lilac Time,"It was the day before the day before yesterday
When we thought everything would now go our way
We inherited a fortune of innocence
And they took it all away

We travel on the last bus from sanity
Through province town to cities of obscurity
And somewhere down the road it occurs to me
That I might have missed my stop

But I will not return to yesterday
Or smooth out the human clay
We'll face this new England like we always have

In a fury of denial
We'll go out dancing on the tiles
Help me down, but don't take me back

I heard a lover calling to Saint Anthony
Sadly treating love like her property
Only battles can be lost and so it seems we do
But I'm hoping for a change

I left you at the bus stop in working town
Now the service has been cut re-named slumber down
I can see you on the bars of your brother's bicycle
Now I hope you're not alone

And all the politician creeps
I know they want them back
And the couturier weeps
She knows they won't come back

And the lovers who seldom speak
I know they want them back
And me falling back into your half term kisses
No I will not

",Return to Yesterday
The Lilac Time,"The angel and the devil
And the Son of heaven
And they're all walking along

Sometimes I think I'm with them
Walking down the street
But I could be wrong

And together
We can move the mountain
Turn the pain to pleasure
If we can stick together

I find living easy
I think the hours are good
People are crazy
But not misunderstood

And if you don't know that you're born
These days it's hard to miss
That we are dying

But

When you were stuck
You were out of luck
But now it's safer to stay stuck
And to never stray

A girl and two boys
She's got American eyes
American eyes

They left school for fame and fortune
But she was the one
The girl with the stars in her eyes
Stars and stripes in her eyes

I was one of the boys
Oh how I loved her
But she wouldn't see me
She shut her apple pie eyes
As blue as Jamaica skies

And oh unrequited love quite often grows
And never quite goes

He was one of the boys
He joined the army
He sailed from American shores
To fight the foreigners' wars

I swear the world won't end tonight
And when we die our spirits fly
Into the light above the sky ",American Eyes
The Lilac Time,"And although nobody touches
Your mind is ragged for riches
Each picture needs its hinges
To swing on when you open
The door snores in a door frame
You're framed by occupation
You want the feathers from the duck's back
Like you need a suit of armour

There's beauty in your body
But you can't see it and don't feel it

And you're looking for something
That people can see in you
And who knows what they're seeing
Without even looking
With forests disappearing
And heavens getting closer
And we aren't even looking
No wonder you don't know

There's beauty in your body
But you can't see it and don't feel it

And on the streets of Aston
Two lovers slowly walking
From cinema to station
A crusade amongst concrete
Jacob and the angel
The lift doors close behind them
And after love like combat
They step into the shower

There's beauty in your body
But you can't see it and don't feel it

You don't feel good
Like I know you should
Baby it's you
It's up to you

As I began to tell you
I saw your eyes glaze over
Like ice across an ocean
Or skaters on a fruit cake
Do you remember childhood?
Did you ever feel good?

Says that we're old friends

I went down to the sea
I met a girl on holiday
With her family

That you've got something to tell me?

Stuck in a scrapbook we're keeping things
Cuttings as yellow as wedding rings
Why are we so sentimental
When life can be so brutal?

I went to her and set me thinking
Who needs any artifice
When the world is full of natural bliss?

I understand that we can't hide

From bearded boys and lank haired girls
Who were right. Right on-

In the hours of idle dreaming
Ten gold leaves my blood is bleeding

Where new Victorian blackouts bleach

Reject their values and their fear

Like a luxury development

But don't be blue he built a fairground there
For you and I to ride

Sometimes scary
Many times we have to pay
We shut our eyes and hold on tight

We'll never part

He knew the lines by heart
But did he know what he was saying?

And that became my noose

And a salary of song

The sovereign of our loving
But the King was cut as was our luck
And now the week is working

Oh I thought the wine and roses years
Had only just begun

And without God they have marshalled time
Into but work or leisure

As in the love I would confess
You shivered far beneath your dress

The rush of delight you gave to me

... a hundred men.
Their hearts were heavy, their heads were high
As they kissed the ones they left behind.
Some were eager, some were scared,
Nobody knew, and nobody cared
When a hundred men went to war.

Then a thousand men went off to war
... a thousand men.
And a few now said that it wasn't right,
And a few said prayers in their beds at night
For the hearts so heavy, the heads so high
Who kissed the ones they loved goodbye,
For those so eager, and those so scared,
A few now knew, a few now cared, 
When a Thousand men went off to war.
... Ten thousand men.

Then a million men went off to war
... a million men.
Now fear came a creepin' down many a street,
Borne on the dust of a million feet,
And many now said that it wasn't right
And many prayed in their beds at night
For the hearts so heavy, the heads so high
Who kissed the ones they loved goodbye,
For those so eager, and those so scared,
For many now knew, and many now cared, 
When a million men went to war.

Then all mankind went off to war,
... Yes, all mankind.
And the people fought, and the people cried,
And the people prayed, but the people died,
And fear like a flood covered every street
And mixed with the mud of a billion feet
And all now said that it wasn't right
And prayed as one to the fiery night.
Their hearts were heavy as they watched the sky
And kissed the ones they loved goodbye
Now none were eager, but all were scared
Now they knew that they should've cared.
When a hundred men went off to war,
... a hundred men.

The Limeliters,"Introduction: This one is the story of Harry Pollitt. 
Harry Pollit was at one time a very influential member of the Communist Party in England, 
Until he was finally throwm out; and when they threw him out, 
They wrote a song about him as if he were dead. 
And it goes like this: 


Harry Pollit was a work; one of Lenin's lads
He was foully murdered by those counter revolutionary cads
Counter revolutionary cads, counter revolutionary cads
He was foully murdered by those counter revolutionary cads!

Old Harry went to heaven 
He reached the Gates with ease,
Said, ""May I speak with Comrade God; 
I am Harry Pollitt please
I'm Harry Pollitt please, I'm Harry Pollitt please,
May I speak with Comrade God, I am Harry Pollitt please.""

""Who are you' said Saint Peter, ""Are you humble and contrite?""
""I'm a friend of Lady Astors.""
""Well, OK. that's quite alright.
OK, that's quite alright, well OK. that's alright
You're a friend of Lady Astor, well OK that's quite alright.""

They put him in the choir, but the hymns he did not like
So he organized the angels and he led them out on strike
Led them out on strike, Led them out on strike
He organized the angels and he led them out on strike!

One day when God was walking around heaven to medidate,
Who should he see but Harry chalkin' slogans on the gate?
Chalkin' slogans on the gate, slogans on the gate
Who should he see but Harry chalkin' slogans on the gate?

Well, they brought him up for trial before the Holy Ghost
For spreadin' disaffection amongst the heavenly hosts
Amongst the heavenly hosts, amongst the heavenly hosts
For spreadin' disaffection amongst the heavenly hosts

Well, the verdict it was guilty, Harry said ""Ah, well'
And he tucked his nightie 'round his knees and he drifted down to hell
Yes, he drifted down to hell, he drifted down to hell
He tucked his nightie 'round his knees and he drifted down to hell.

Now seven long years have passed, Harry's doing swell
He's just been made the first people's commissar for soviet hell,
Commissar of soviet hell, commissar of soviet hell
He's just been made the first people's commissar of soviet hell!

Well the moral of this story Is easy for to tell, 
If you want to be a Bolshevik, 
You'll have to got to hell, 
If you want to be a bolshevik, you'll have to go to hell, 
Yes, you'll have to go to hell, 
If you want to be a Bolshevik, 
You'll have to go to hell!

Past your boxed up hollow station

Fire your attention away from jaws to your feet where
We'll make 'em, make 'em move forward

You are one step closer towards your own betterment

Living in the lights, never caught you a breakthrough
The people are in lines, trying to be you
Oh, and now you are dancing

From silhouettes to the beating drums
With the free will towards their own experiment
Underneath the covered core are countless numbers

The truth lies somewhere within

In stone and never hidden from sin

To echo something relevant
An ear may concede and the other may bleed
You just don't know

Why don't we just face the facts
And leave it all alone?

Eyes can be revealing, eyes can be cheating
It takes two to make some sense of it
Mirror one another, attempt to read the glow
And see if you seeing is clear

Unfocused but wise, some x-ray type
Decipher a coded artifact
The deeper you peep you fall back asleep
I just don't know

The Little Ones,"A wind rushed in and circled our heads in a blazing trail
With outlines and figures of leaders in silent and gone
Our eyes draped in color with each passing hour and our bodies grew small
And voices, once listless burst out in pitches so tall

We arched our backs to see the light
Sway to the downbeat fire
In their heads they were so inspired
As they danced to their hearts' desire

At that moment we motioned to the sun
Waved our hands around based on the idea of time
Oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah
Wife us and clothe us, and clothe us until the dawn burst forth
Straight from the backroom, years that were calling for more

Who is the next one? Show 'em the limelight
Who is the next one? Show 'em the limelight
Check to the front sun and show 'em the limelight

Your ringing seaside crawl

The mist grows more and more

I have wanted to tell you
I hope to meet you there

The Little Ones,"Easterly winds whisking the kids
There are new-borns all around
Lampposts guide them but the lights just died there
And they slow to a crawl

Misting aside their eyes open wide
At the sight of golden youth
Fathers and mothers gather in numbers
When the sales greeter do

Dreamt of the leaves, stitched up the seams
And they all counted down
Each one mutter pair with another
And the young ones go round

Fading dreams and rich tangerine
The sky began to fall
Figures stack up whether they close up
They make the final call

With warmth from the sun and visions of what they want
Rise up as one counting down to one
With warmth from the sun and visions of what they want
Rise up as one counting down to one

Hours are minutes that beat with your heart
Old mother told you to wait for your turn

Leaves for the covers, to offer relief
But the ring of the streets hammer gently
Mocking my sleep

Waiting for the evenin' train
To kill that old familiar pain
Weavin' through my tangled brain
When I tipped my bottle back
Smacked into a cop I didn't see

That policeman said, ""Mister Cool
If you ain't drunk, then you're a fool""
I said, ""If that's against the law
Tell me why I never saw
No man locked in this jail of yours
Wasn't just as low down poor as me?""

Yes, and I wound up in jail to spend the night

My head was really gone
And like my thick old tongue
Was lickin' something sick and wrong
I said, ""I'd sell my soul for something
About as wet and cold as this old cell""

All eaten up with sympathy
Then poured himself another beer
Came and whispered in my ear
""If booze was just a dime a bottle
Boy, you couldn't even buy the smell""

I said, ""I knew there's something I liked about this town""
Oh, but it'll take more than that to bring me down
Cause there's still a lot of wine and lonely girls

Well, they finally came and told me
They was a gonna set me free
And I'd be leavin' town
If I knew what was good for me
I said, ""It's nice to learn
That everybody's so concerned about my health""

But I won't be leavin' no more quicker than I can
And I've enjoyed about as much of this as I can stand
And I don't need this town of yours

Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming,
Remember me at the close of a long, long day. 
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me. 
The sweetest songs belong to lovers in the gloaming, 
The sweetest days are days that used to be. 
The saddest words I ever heard were words of parting
When you said ""Sweetheart, remember me."" 

You told me once that you were mine alone forever
And I was yours till the end of eternity. 
But all those vows are broken now, and we will never
Be the same except in memory. 

[Chorus]

A brighter face may take my place when we're apart, dear, 
A sweeter smile, a love more bold and free. 
But in the end, fair weather friends may break your heart, dear. 
If they do, sweetheart, remember me.

The Little Willies,"Well, you said you had enough
You said that you were leaving
I said, shove off honey, baby I ain't grieving
Pack your bags and pull out this evening
There's a wide open road
Early this morning you were nowhere about
And so I searched the town, but you had done pulled out
I looked north, east and west and then a-leading south
I saw a wide open road

There's a wide open road
It's leading south from my abode
If you stick a round and turn your damper down
There's a wide open road

Well, the reason I was looking for you all over town
Was to tell you that your kitty cat is still around
And you left your wedding ring when you went down
That wide open road
If you're gonna stay away, then honey let me know
How to cook hot biscuits, how to roll the dough
Everything's gone crazy since I told you to go
Down the wide open road

There's a wide open road
And honey, I want you to know
You can look down south or you can turn back home
And there's a wide open road",Wide Open Road

 The only key that I see to defeat you 
 would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you 
 and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe 
 I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse 
 you'll think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you 
 (Bitch!) I ain't no fuckin G, I'm a cannibal 
 I ain't tryin to shoot you, 
 I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you 
 Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass 
 and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress 
 Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!) 
 Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis 
 I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket 
 to fill it full of explosive gasses 
 and close it back with a lit match in it 
 while I sit back and just hope it catches 
 Blow you to fragments 
 Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes

 One day we all gon' die 
 But when I die, I'ma be so high 
 that I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare 
 with the chalk outline still there 
 I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot 
 I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock 
 Now if I pray everynight (night) 
 Do I still have to hold my trey very tight? 
 You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth 
 I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse 
 I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse 
 Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk 
 See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Nordface

 Angels greet me but I don't reply back 
 Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?

 Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger 
 I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound 
 And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds 
 My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger 
 Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her 
 Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her 
 Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager

I can't seem to run and hide
Prisoner of something, but I can't quite make it out

To make a brand new start

I can feel it taking hold
Well here it comes again
Now the devil's got my soul",Traces of Doubt

Both strivin' for a perfect world, each havin' their own opinion.
They all they see; it grows; it grows on and on.

Is bad for your health

Is all part of the game
Nothing will ever be different

Always a liar, playing with fire

Sent you
Hey it's all monkey see monkey do
What's really inside of you
What's the motives to the things you do
Things you thought you knew
Nobody knows if nobody grows

Reach to increase intermediate
To the top inner seeds in a medium
Untapped like a natural element
Expelled in the breeze

Seize the moment
These opponents
They really don't want it
I mean why put it out if your ass don't own it

And then they write it down and journalize
Speculate and generalize
Mask your lives in all these lies
They need to realize

Look between ya eyes this life ain't free man
Ya got to pay for what you need.

Cross the deadly sea
To live eternally

Tidal waving saving both coasts like we need
A coastguard, striking hard
Lightening force we the force...

Powerful potions spread across
Globes on a map through
The windy moss
The oceans holding the answers lost

Deal with the cost
Find what's lost
Who wants to be found?
So many want to be fly but stand on shaky ground

Earth quaking braking down the walls of society
Lie to me; tell me that it's all right all night

All tight like a twister
Mister I'm your master
Faster than a flash flood
Taking blood in disasters

And after they donate
The dead hands will pronate
And FEMA might come through
But they always show late

These fates will force ya
Have ya racin' like a Porsche
High powered outa control
Of the talents that you hold

Marsupial thoughts
Ideas tucked down underneath the skull cap
Clung to the main frame
With a sharp aim
My life force is a push
And a push is like a shove
At times it's disastrous
But it's all done for the love

[Chorus x3:]
It's the forces of nature
They be pushin' through the winds
Pushin' through these lives that were in
This touch of life as it begins
When we be kickin' it with folks and our friends
It's in our nature, it's in our nature

Since, I feel we really been blessed by the goddess
Man we best to stay modest
Humble like the tumbleweeds that travel cross the brain
Roaming on the plains of your thoughts
Feel the wind gust feel us when we gots..

A gift of speech
Kids could reach in, pull up their chins
Challenge gravity
Opposite of a cavity, build
Ain't no time to yield, feel the thrill
When you're out of forces you're at a standstill

Yes the fans will follow
If your soul's not hollow
Shallow like a wade pool
Got ya feelin' like a fake fool
Decisions that'll brake you
Make you realize the stakes fool
This is what the force will do!!!

Make you see what's real, and wipe off the residue
I vow to flow fresh and forever stay true
Doing what I got to do, doing what I want to do
The opposite of a faker, it's the forces of nature

Tapping me with taxes isn't natural
My axis is an actual attraction
To the earth that I've been trapped in

In dilapidated fractions of the masses
We're attractin'
Quite magnetic we pull
If ya stuck in the rut
We make happen, forces tapping
On your soul, life windows
That's fogged up and clogged up blah blah blah

[Chorus x3]",Forces of Nature
The Living Legends,"[Chorus: x 2]
I'm gonna tell 'em that I'm not here
Ain't taking no calls today
Time to refresh and do it all my way
Get off my back
Not taking orders
It's time to refresh, make tracks and sing

[The Grouch]
Bring about that piece of mind and recline
Let your guard down and see what you find
Inhale and exhale deeply, get loose
Stretch out your muscles and squeeze you some juice

Light that incense up and then bless your space
Go to that place where the calm is on your face
I promise that a taste of this is pure bliss
Where thought grows freely and minutes mean shit

I'm up in it clean fit, dreamin' so vivid
I let it all radiate, you see how I'm livin'
Energized and rested, tested time after time
I'm impressed with my body and mind

My hobby's so strenuous I gotta cool out
Focus on health so that I'm not ruled out
Exercise my knowledge and abolish all stress
Get a good sleep and tomorrow I press

Today I'm...

[Chorus: x 2]

[Bicasso]
Now let's pretend that I was just born
A niggas first breath, heartbeat, a life with no scorn
It wasn't me, it was the egos of MCs they say
The mic tempt me too

But like the dollars makes 'em fishy dude ok
The average day I got the duties of a lifeguard for myself
When I'm swimmin' in a system makes it so hard
But at the rest I just post up fine,

Patrol my coastline and make the most of my mind
Create the envelope and push it to the people on the avenue
The ones stuck in they offices, this world is a vacuum
But my sauce it got some smack too

Like on a Sunday afternoon I got you tuned into the spiciness
Blended just right with this in the pocket like some jeans
Or the rhythm of these funk strings and I might just get
Another dosage of this slow shit

It's bumpin in my system and my soul too,
It's what I do when I'm alone, it's like some soul food
I wouldn't just get up from the table man, it's too smooth
This groove is better than any wrong thing

And if the phone rings I'm'a hit 'em back now
Let the song sing...

[Chorus: x 2]

[Pep Love]
I'm unavailable for comment
I'd rather go sail my boat and ride the tail of a
Comet, inhale of the chronic, a glass of orange juice,
Read a book, write a poem,

Hike a trail in the forest dude!
Breathe in fresh air
Release pressure
Extend and bend and strength yeah!

Burn a incense, silence my mind in a instant
Because now is the time and I'm in this
It gets me open like Halls Mentholyptus
Pine cones and eucalyptus leaves

Mushrooms and wild flowers bloom
And cool Cali breeze
Make me feel superhuman
I might fly a kite, go home rock the mic

Throw on a song I like, call up my girl to bone
I'm in my own world, a zone
And it be them days like this when I don't answer the phone
I'm clearing my space

Excuse me while I take this brief intermission
From out the rat race
No hustle and bustle though my muscles are strong
I just don't want to do nothing

But sing my song...

The Living Legends,"Awwww man
It's late as fuck
The sun is coming out
It's a long-ass night, but I feel good

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I really give a fuck what you think
You could judge me til your face turn pink
Just ripped the show and we did what you can't
Luck, and I'm drunk and I'm far in the paint
I'm in Prague, she's in awe
Never really seen a black man with charm
Hopped in the cab and we off to the bar
On the other side of town where the drinks come strong
Five in the morning, I know the night young but she yawning
Took her to the 'tel let her feel what she wanting
I know I did it big I could tell by her moaning
In the morning in the morning

I know things could get all crazy
But you made it from the hating
I know, I know

Girl you all up in my mind
I just wanna see you go shine
So let's go, let's go

I'm taking a long-ass flight overseas
Sleeping on the plane until I reach Germany
Tiny group of people in Berlin, they heard of me
Stepping on stage to murder shit around three
Stinky motherfuckers usually surround me
But I don't clown, the got love for my sound
They want to see a party go down
With a cigarette burning past the filter, degrees
In the club hot mic feeds, they hop like fleas
When they feel the energy
They got the Pac white tees
But they love a little me
They love a little me, they love a little me

I'm on the west side of town
A tiny little spot where it all goes down
A black new world in the bottom of the village
With cute little girls in their black bottom, vintage
High-heeled boots, and they sippin'
Two dollar Cabernet, juke joint spinnin'
Late night nigger cabaret, never-endin'
Lindy hoppin to new be-boppin'
And fools be stopping through fitted
Wonder where it was? Better get in
Or holla at Diallo if you with it
That's my nigga

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It was a foreign exchange like Tay and them
Eatin' Mickey D's breakfast at six AM
Ain't nothing flyer than a Japanese sunrise
I wasn't just trying to hit it like some guys
Hash browns, hotcakes, and I cleaned my plate
I can't count all the bullshit that I done ate
She told me that she spoke English and I said great
Grabbed her hand out the club and I said let's skate
(Let's go)
Man this life so special
When the stress and strife try to test you
DUI and they try to arrest you
If you faded coming home from the club, God bless you

I had a party at my house tonight
Every girl that came through looked tight
All the homies had fun, there's no need to fight
So much drank and weed to keep us high as a kite
Now the sun is coming out, to chase the night away
If you listen really close, you could still hear the DJ play
She was beautiful, I hung on every single word she said
Like, let's get close there's no time to wait
My niggas ain't gotta go home
But ya'll sure can't stay

Good music for the grown and sexy
My lady and I, two of the best seats
But we ain't sitting down, we in step see
Big booty up close, pressed to me
I grab her waist and I smell her perfume
Jill Scott keeps singing her tune
Full moon and it's feeling real now
Babysitter, one o'clock and we still out
Blow the joint, breath the air, hit a detour
No one can see us in this lot, you could be sure
Make it hot, get the windows steamy
Car rocking, it's great to be me

Let's go
Ha

We could fly to Galapagos
Swim in the Ivory Coast
Roll in the sands, hand in hand
Let me hold ya close
Sip on some wine and toast
Down the shore lines and posts

You the one that I chose
Rub you down to your toes

You shouldn't do hard drugs man, you know what I'm saying?
You shouldn't do drugs that are harder than you
If you a soft muthafucker, you shouldn't do hard drugs
How about that? Because the hangover in the morning is going to beat yo ass
That's the problem, shout out to everybody who was drinking Hennessey all night
Or all you dumb motherfuckers who bought that Ace of Spades champagne
Because Jay-Z put it in his new video. How 'bout that?
How about you have a mind of your own man?

An if you get pulled over like I said before, you're going to jail, but its alright
And if you downloaded this for free, you're never going to get laid again
Like Monsignor. Monsignor, when's the last time you got some pussy?
And if it's 6 AM and you just called a girl that got a bay of yours
And you gonna go have sex with the baby asleep in the bed next you, you scandalous
But it's a way of life you know hat I'm saying?
And if look, look, look, look, to all the Mexican homies headed to King Taco in East LA

And I noticed there wasn't a chair

Drinking her wine

In the morning and started to laugh

Flesh and bones divine, three cheers for the nothingness

How does it feel to not have a reason?
You're living this life on your own
Because God is dead, we went and killed Him
And we're dancing around on the bones

Burn the churches down
They represent weakness
Strip the morals from this town
They're hand in hand with the lower class

It always seems that just as I
Build the strength enough to climb and fight
The trees they grow in and block my sight
And now I'm stuck here with my darkest inner thoughts

I pleaded and prayed to you to come and take away
The voices and the choices that are bound to tear me limb from limb
They told me that you hear in some other way but if the answer is unknown
Then why should I believe them when they say
That you're up there and you honestly do care?

Everyone is singing now about the God, the God of love
But I don't feel it in my heart right now
The comforting reassurance of a cause but I want to believe

The Lonely Island,"Now let's take a trip down memory lane
Back to junior high school where it all began
Three bad little kids raising hell at school
We were just thirteen straight actin' a fool

Every day after class, kiv's house was the spot
Making crazy prank calls hoping not to get caught
Best friends, blood brothers, yo, we one and the same
'Till one fateful afternoon when everything changed

One day playing punch out up in kiv's room
The house started shaking and we heard a ""kaboom""
Looked out the back window saw a billow of smoke
Yo, your backyard is smashed, man this isn't a joke

(Let's go check this out man!) (I bet, let's go)

All the smoke and debris led straight to the basement
Yo, what the hell is that? man, it looks like a spaceship!
We all ran for cover and the hatch opened wide
And a little green dude stepped out from inside

He said, ""I'm from mars, and I come in peace
I have something to ask, and it's not discreet
There's a mutated strain in our dna helix
And you three kids are the ones who can heal it""

But we're just thirteen, man, what can we do?
""Um, how should I put this? I think we should screw"" (what?)
""On our home planet we can no longer breed
I've been sent a self-receptacle for storing your seed""

Storing our seed? yo, I think he means sex
Man, I'm a virgin, we all are, bad!
""I'm just gonna lie here, and close my eyes""
Aw, what should we do? now it's spreading it's thighs!

""You'll be heroes on our planet!"" but why us three?
""You're the chosen ones, you'll just have to trust me""

(Yo should we do it?) (I don't know!)
(Yo, I say we put it to a vote.)
All in favor, say aye. aye!

Okay, we're in! ""cool."" Who should go first?
""I have three depositories to capture your burst""
Wait, at the same time? ""yeah, that's what I was thinking
Now here's some wine coolers, let's get you boys drinking""

We pounded the drinks, and started getting tipsy
We took our positions, and started getting frisky
One in the front and two in the back
Had it locked up like a Chinese finger trap

""Keep pumping away! my wife and family thank you""
I'm about to explode! yo son, me too!
Three way climax! best friends forever!
Who would thought that we've lost our virginities together

""Andy, Jorm and Kiv, you've saved our race
Your reward is one wish then I'll go back to space""
We looked at eachother, didn't have to talk
Knew exactly what he wanted before he took off

Mr. alien sir, for what it's worth
We wanna be the greatest fake mc's on earth

""your wish is granted, and thanks again
You may have saved my planet but I'm losing three friends

Therefore your name is incredibad""",Incredibad

Oh shit, Santana d-v-x? that's my joint!
(mine too, but a lot of these busters don't know about it)
Well let's tell these motherfuckers!

As a kid, I used to lay awake and think
When was Santana gonna make a drink?
But now I'm all grown and my dream came true
Santana champagne, from here to you
From the heart of napa valley and the guitar king
Comes a sparkling wine, to make a blind man sing
Yo it's the cham-pan-yah, from the man with the bandanna
I can't stand a flute with anything but Santana
What's the first name in cham, it's Carlos
And to that man I propose a toast
In the 60's, he had lots of freebie sex
But now he's gettin' down with the d-v-x

Excuse me fellas!
Am I to understand that Carlos Santana has made a champagne?
(that's right motherfucker! here, try it)
Alright aw shit!

I feel alive for the first time
Each sip hits my lips like a landmine
Without Carlos in my life I was livin' a lie
He makes his guitar weep, but his champagne cries
He's a southwest, tie wearin' bolo champ
Comin' straight out the box with a bolo champ'
Yo he a beast with the sugar and yeast, mix it in pots
Like the way his release mixed jazz blues and pops
And the salsa fusion, he's lady's shoe producin'
Plus he teamed with rob Thomas for a music revolution
On the 7th day, it was said god rest
But on the 8th day he made the d-v-x

Gentlemen, gentlemen, what is all the hubbub about?
(Carlos Santana!) that's right
I see bitches-is enjoyin' my sparkling wine
(we certainly are) well be careful
Cause this shit'll get you fucked up
Bitch!

I'm like no other, one of a kind, my sparkling wine
Santana d-v-x make you wanna have sex (ooh)
I'm rich bitch! I'm havin' my chips
Get laid all the time, by 70's chicks, uh
Won hella grammies, batches throw me they panties
I'm probably your daddy, I probably nutted in your mammy
I'm a bay boy, city life, been around the corner
Try to play me foul and my vatos goin' run up on ya
A legend, a boss, that's what I are
Ask about me pimp, 'tana be killin' the guitar
Old enough to know better but young enough to not care
I get active - might slap a bitch with my hair (whip)
Left coast up top I bang that shit
My sparkling wine'll pop crystal on her lip
Can't stop, won't stop gettin' my bread
Pack arenas and coliseums now watch me shred

Well I checked out the track and I loved it,
And I wrote you this big, sexy hook I think you're gonna really dig.
Oh wow that's great, awesome.
You wanna just lay it down?
Boys let's get to it (to it to it to it)

Uh, Lonely Island, Michael Bolton (Yeah)
The night starts now
Together on the track, the boys are back
The night starts now
Night starts now, baby, roll with us
Chickens snapping at the neck when we rollin' up (Rollin' up!)
Blow through the doors, ain't no holdin' up
Black card at the bar like I gives a fuck (Come on!)

Ladies shifty eyed when we walk into the set
Fuck the fellas looking jealous
Play the back and get wet (Yeah yeah)
Three pound in my waist, shank in my sock,
You either get cut, get stuffed or get shot.

This is the tale of Captain Jack Sparrow
Pirate so brave on the seven seas (What?)
A mystical quest to the isle of Tortuga
Raven locks sway on the ocean's breeze

Yeah that was kinda weird, but we're back in the club
Buying up the bar so the groupies show us love (Keira Knightley!)
Motherfucking ice-man, I'm the top gunner
Heater on blast, I'm the number one stunner (Jack Sparrow!)

Watch it girl cause I ain't your ""Mr. Nice Guy"",
More like the ""meet ya, take you home and fuck you twice guy""
(Yeah yeah!)
All dressed up with nowhere to run,
And now I make you feel crazy with the-
(Now back to the good part!)

From the day he was born
He yearned for adventure (No!)
Old Captain Jack (Yeah)
Giving them what for
He's the pauper of the surf
The jester of Tortuga (Oh God)
But is Davy Jones' locker
What lies in store? (Yeah, we've seen the movie)

Throw your hands in the air
And say hell yeah

Captain Jack (What?)
Johnny Depp (No)

From the front to the back
Say we count stacks c'mon

Davy Jones (Nope)
Giant squid (Wrong)

Michael Bolton we're really gonna need you to focus up

Roger that let me try it with another film (Wait)
Life is a box of chocolates and my name is Forrest Gump (Not better)
Though I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed
I give Jenny all my love (Come on)
Okay, then I'm a legal aid
Erin Brockovich is my name (Oh God)
Then you can call me Scarface
Snortin' mountains of cocaine (Close enough)
You cockroaches wanna play rough?
Okay, I'm reloaded! Ha ha!

This is the tale of Tony Montana
Cubano flame with the Miami nuts
(Take it home!)
Got a basehead wife
But her womb is polluted
This whole town's a pussy
Just waiting to get fucked
Just waiting to get fucked!
(Okay it turns out Michael Bolton is a major cinephile)
You complete me (Yeah, yeah okay)",Jack Sparrow
The Lonely Island,"Whoa!
I can't believe we're in Japan!
Look at all the lights!
The food!
The people!
Wow!

We're three cool white friends in Japan (Japan!)
We've never been to Japan
So we wrote a song about the three of us in Japan
And our label has to pay for it

Here we are at our five star hotel
The one from Lost In Translation (In Japan!)
The views are amazing
And their champagne waiting
Because that's how we wrote it (Yummy!)

And now the label has to pay for the video (Yay!)
And pay for everything that we say (No matter what!)
For example I'll be getting a massage right now
And I'll be drinking some sake (So expensive!) (Who cares?)

Here we are at the most expensive sushi restaurant in Japan (mm!)
And now we're at Tokyo Disneyland
And now we're in Hawaii for one random shot that our label has to pay for!

Cause we're three cool white friends in Japan (In Asia!)
The fact that we're white isn't why we're friends
But we are white, and we're friends (In Japan)

At this point in the video we'll be super drunk (Weee!)
Standing near some kind of dragon
And then we'll buy some stinky used girls panties
Out of one of those pervert vending machines
Now we've seen sumo wrestling live
Unless we get dropped by our label

Cause we're three white douche-bags in Japan (That's us!)
It's all part of our master plan
To get some much needed R&R
At the expense of Universal Records

Wow look at all this Japanese money
It's called Yen
I heard it's worth more than American money
Let's dump it in the river!

The Lonely Island,"Here’s a little story that I think you’ll like
It’s not about Shaq or Iron Mike
So buckle your seat belts it’s gonna get choppy
And listen to the tale of the time I fought Rocky

One day me and all my friends were hangin’
Talkin’ ‘bout which of the girls was most bangin’

Then one friend says “you know who’s really tough?
Rocky” (hit me holmes) the boxer, man

I said “yeah I know what about him?” he said
“He’s really tough”

No way man, I’m callin’ your bluff
I think that I could take him and to prove my point
I’ll challenge him in public (hit me homes)

YEAH THAT’S THE JOINT
So the very next day stay true to my word
And I snuck on tv, so I could be heard
I said “Rocky if you’re out there I think you’re a nerd,
And I’ll lick you and bury you like a dog turd”

I got kicked out but the candle was lit
Cause the people had to know if my plan was legit
It made the headlines then I got the call
It was Rocky (hey) and he wanted to brawl
We negotiated terms, and set the date
Then I went into training to add some muscle weight
While I punched on meat in a rickety shack
He was sippin’ on wine and havin’ models rub his back
At the weigh-in, boy the tension was high
Me and Rock toe to toe and eye to eye
I talked some trash we got pulled apart
I shot him one last look to strike fear in his heart

Skip ahead, the big night is finally here
My body was ripped and my mind was clear
We entered the arena to the roar of the crowd
People chanting my name, I never felt so proud

Faced off once more in the center of the ring
Touch gloves, said a prayer, then the bell went (ding)
He hit me with a left and shattered my face
And a right sent my teeth all over the place
Then another great punch caved in my eye socket
He broke my jaw and my trainer yelled “stop it!”
But nobody heard him and he crushed my ribs
Blood sprayed off my face and onto some kids
They yelled out “more!” and Rocky obliged
I had to think of some way to turn the tides
So I leaned back to hit him with all of my might
Took a swing but he caught me with a sucker-punch right
Then a sucker-punch left and a sucker-punch right
Then twenty-two consecutive sucker-punch rights

He tore off my arms and beat me with ‘em
Then threw acid in my face which obscured my vision
He kicked me in the leg and fractured my shin
The bone splinter shot right out of my skin
People barfed in the crowd, they were going insane!
Then Rocky punched my nose bone into my brain
I was quivering and twitching when I soiled my shorts
Then Rocky pissed on me, customary in sports
The doctor came out and pronounced me dead
And that was the night I fought Rocky",Rocky
The Lonely Island,"I was walkin' through the city streets
And a man walks up to me and hands me the latest energy drink
""Run faster, jump higher""
Man, I'm not gonna let you poison me

I ain't gonna be part of your system
Man! Pump that garbage in another man's face

I go to my favorite hot dog stand
And the dude says,
""You come here all the time! Here's one for free.""
I said, ""Man! What I look like? A charity case?""

I took it and threw it on the ground!
I don't need your handouts!
I'm an adult!
Please!
You can't buy me hot dog, man!

At the farmer's market with my so called girlfriend
She hands me her cell phone, says it's my dad
Man, this ain't my dad!
This is a cell phone!

I threw it on the ground!
What, you think I'm stupid?
I'm not a part of your system

Some poser hands me cake at a birthday party

Whatcha want me to do with this? Eat it?

Happy birthday to the ground!
I threw the rest of the cake, too!

So many things to throw on the ground
Like this, and this, and that, and even this

Two Hollywood phonies try to give me their autograph
Ground!
Nobody wants your autograph, phonies!

Then the two phonies got up
Turned out they had a taser
And they tased me in the butt-hole

Fell to the ground

The Lonely Island,"Oh! Its been a long time coming.
Two of the worlds greatest.
Americas sweetheart, Ms. Reba McEntire. (Yeah, yeah. How ya doing Andy?)
Were about to take it to the top. (Hoo hoo hoo hoo.)
Hit em Reba.

Haters in my face trying to keep me down
But you know we keep on shinin. (Here we go!)
Two crazy big stars from opposite worlds
Bout to set this track on fire. (Yeah!)

Shes the queen of country
Hes the comedy prince
Making something out of nothing. (Ha ha!)
We hooked up in the studio to make this song.
But as usual we ended up fucking. (No doubt.)

Flash back to when I first met Reba
Sitcom dressing room, puffing on Cheeba
Said I was a fan, she said prove it
Dropped her denim skirt and said, hop to it.

Made love all night. (More like we fucked.)
Kids banging on the door trying to interrupt
But them autographs can wait, cuz this is way too strong
I cant leave it alone, because her pussy's the bomb.

Well my pussy is the bomb and that's a fact
But these N words keep on trippin'(OK)
So I stay on my prime and drop these hits
Cuz I cant go back to stripping (I'm Reba!)

You're my undercover freak
And your my best friend, but our families don't approve.
That's right, cuz I'm a city boy
And I'm a country girl, and I'll never leave your sweet balls blue.

That's because a girl like Reba got just what I need
With big broad shoulders and a red ass weave (And a penis.)
Hot damn, she fly.
All she wanna do is bump me
I'm a lucky guy (I'm a guy too)

My friends think I should dump her
They say shes a man who found a wig in a dumpster. (Your friends are smart.)

Nah, Rebes, they're just jealous
Cuz I'm dating a star instead of hanging with the fellas. (Hanging like my nuts.)

Word up. They're just liars.
They cant believe I can pull Reba McEntire.

Ever since I came out of my mamas butt
I knew I was destined for greatness. (Yeah!)
I looked in a dumpster and saw a wig
And thought, hey brother, I'm gonna take this. (Tell em, Reba!)

So I put it right on and took a stroll
Right over to 30 Rock (SNL!)
I saw Andy Sandberg and he thought I was Reba
And I made him suck my dirty cock.

I can't believe I fucked my aunt
I fucked my aunt y'all

I was thirteen, skinny little freckle-faced kid
Growin' up in the country felt like doin' a bid
But the summers were my favorite when we swam in the lake
And trips to the city, what a magical place
First baseball game, man, I'll never forget
Crackerjacks, bleacher seats and the crack of the bat
My friend Tim caught a ball, but he gave it to me
And five years later, I fucked my aunt

Damn, I fucked my aunt
I can't believe that I fucked my aunt
Man, I really fucked my aunt
I fucked my aunt, y'all

Rainstorms always give me the blues
Worst one in ten years on the evening news
She rode her bike over cause the streets was closed
My aunt standing there in soaking wet clothes
We opened some wine and laughed like kids
She told me funny things that her and my mom did
But then my uncle called and she had to go
And twelve years later, I fucked her sister

Damn I fucked my aunt
Can you believe that I fucked my aunt?
Man, I guess I fucked my aunt
I fucked my aunt y'all

It was my eighteenth birthday, the world was still new
My parents threw me a party as parents will do
My uncle's wife gave me a punny gift
It was an ant farm, man she was a trip
Later that night I was up in my room
I watched as the small ant community bloomed
So simple, yet so complex, I contemplated my own life
And wondered what would come next
I took out my favorite ant and crushed it with my dick
And also, I fucked my aunt

Damn, I fucked my ant
And I fucked my aunt

Man, we fucked our aunts
We fucked our aunts y'all

Oh, I can't believe it
They fucked their aunts
I mean, I fucked my aunt too
But you don't see me making songs about it
Although we technically didn't have sex
Just some above the clothes stuff
And some under the clothes stuff
I mean what is sex really?
Is it just penetration?
Or do you have to finish?

Trick, you better think again

We are not gentlemen

Then turn around and start huggin' her cousin

Then her friend jump in, I'm wit' it
I hug 'em tighter than a tube top

Before the other shoe drop

I get more hugs than Oprah selling drugs
And the drug was pure x no, Mary Jo sex
Just hugs

Don't get mad, girl, we get mad girls
And we're hugging all over the world
So don't catch feelings, it ain't love
We're just the kings of giving out hugs
And if you wanna settle down, you know you got us all wrong
So we on to the next one, no disrespect, hon
But you can't hug a rolling stone

You can't hug a rolling stone cause it'll crush you
Begging me to hug you again? that's when I shush you
On an airplane, at a Knicks game
Feel the same damn thing when I hug them
Which is nothing
Can't trust them, lose all respect when I hug them

Now guess who's back in the motherfucking house
With a fat hug for your sweater and your blouse
Hugged so many ladies, arms shaky and shit
Because I'm the Wilt Chamberlain of the upper-body grip

Cause I get more hugs than a batch of puppy pugs
Sitting on a fluffy rug, getting tickled touched and rubbed
(Oh shit!)
Real talk, like you chatting with a fisherman
Wrap these chicks up like a motherfucking swisher, man

This ain't love girl, because this hug world
Is just a big game of thrones
We be king of the castle, got arms like a lasso
But you can't hug a rolling stone

I been hugging on your mama
Especially when your daddy's gone
Wearing his pajamas
I know you thinking that is wrong
I don't care what some does
I'm concentrating on her back
I just wanna hug your mama in her Subaru hatchback
Put her in a figure-4, yes I'm a hug gigolo
Now she tells her Tupperware friends to let their sisters know

That I give more hugs than atlas had shrugs
(Brush my head on her shoulder)
While your man mean mugs (We get hugs)

We had fun, girl, but don't get sprung, girl
Just because I hugged you raw
We can do a group thing, bring Sarah and suan
And we can have a hug-a-trois
So quit trying to own my hugs
I gave you these arms on loan
So come give me a hug
The waistline and above
When push comes to shove
You can't hug a rolling stone

Hug yo' bad p, bitches",Hugs
The Lonely Island,"Nowadays, everybody's using curse words
Seems to me like it ain't necessary
Yeah, so when I get steamed
Yo I tell 'em like this

I don't give a honk, I don't give a honk
And if you think I do, my friend
Then you're wronk
Your crocodile tears can go and got gonk
You think I'm a funk, but we don't give a honk

I'm a wild child and I'm on the loose
Giving less of a honk than a Muslim goose
Saw a broken car horn and its honk was faint
Man if I was Senator, it'd be a honkless state

Yo, I drove past a rally saying ""Honk For Peace""
So I took out my gun and shot 'em all in the knees
I don't give a honk! You picked the wrong dude
If a honk was my virginity, consider me prude

I consider it rude to have honk-spectations
Only thing I give a honk is a long vacation
On a long space station, can't hear you scream
And they sure can't hear you honk, know what I mean?

Yo we told you before: we don't give a honk
And saying that we do is just simpoly ridonk
You could try to buy us off with your pesos and francs
But your money means nothing you could take it to the bonk

Man, I'm stingy when it comes to my honks (me too)
I literally stick 'em to my body with glue
Good thinkin' Abe Lincoln, you're a real smart cookie
Teach a class about giving a honk? I'm playing hooky

Now what you gonna do with all your honks?
Gonna dive in and swim like Scrooge McDonk
Cause for a honk I'd bite a chunk out of a Buddhist monk
And at his funeral, everyone will sing this sonk

Yo we told you before: we don't give a honk
Got a theory that we do? Well your theory's debunked
Save the drama for your mama cause your itis is bronch
Our policy is staunch: we don't give a honk

You know a honk in some countries is considered a food
And if you don't eat it all, it's considered quite rude
We all know we're born with 100 honks
But people throw 'em away like they were Donkey Konks
And the honks are the barrels

The kings and the pharaohs sing about honks
Like they were Christmas carols
I'll punch you in the jeans
But this ain't Lonely Island
And if I catch you steaming my honks
I'll get violent

Yo we told you before: we don't give a honk
Even if you give us candy like Willy the Wonk
But don't come for my honks, better know your place
Mother-honkers honk around and get honked in the face

You're rocking one solo titty, and that's your right
Now you're running this city with one sexy titty

She got legs and she knows how to use 'em
Also got one titty out sounds so confusing!
Proving she knows how to get attention
One laid-back titty with no pretention

A strong choice, or just a mistake?
A strong choice, or just a mistake?
Is fashion really what she's all about?
Intentional, or does she even know it's out?

The Lonely Island,"YOLO

YOLO, you only live once

The battle cry of a generation
This life is a precious gift
So don't get too crazy
It's not worth the risk

You know that we are still young
So don't be dumb
Don't trust anyone
Cause you only live once

Ugh, you only live once
That's the motto
So take a chill pill
Ease off the throttle

Never go to loud clubs
Cause it's bad for your ears
Your friends will all be sorry
When they can't hear

And stay the hell away from drugs
Cause they're not legal
Then bury all your money in the backyard
Like a beagle

'Cause you should never trust a bank
They've been known to fail
And never travel by car, a bus
Boat or by rail

And don't travel by plane
And don't travel at all
Built a bomb shelter basement
With titanium walls

And wear titanium suits
In case pianos fall on ya
And never go in saunas
Cause they're crawlin' with piranhas

And never take the stairs
'Cause they're often unsafe
You only live once
Don't let it go to waste

You know that we are still young
So hold off on the fun
Cook your meat 'til it's done
Cause you only live once

Yeah
And here's another piece of advice
Stay away from kids
Cause their hair is filled with mad lice

There's no such thing
As too much Purell
This a cautionary tale
Word to George Orwell

So don't 1980 force
Any plugs into sockets
Always wear a chastity belt
And triple lock it

Then hire a taster
Make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy
Then destroy him

No blankets or pajamas
They can choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture
Killing machines

Board your windows up
The sun is bad for your health
And always wear a straight jacket
So your safe from yourself

Take no chances (no chances)
Stop freelancin' (right now)
Invest in your future
Don't dilute your finances (uh huh)
401K, make sure it's low risk
Then get some real estate (how much?)
4.2% thirty year mortgage
That's important, that's a great deal
And if you can't afford it
Don't forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now
A dependable savings
And you'll retire with money in your account
Beast

YOLO, say no no
Isolate yourself
And just roll solo
Be care-folo
You oughta look out
Also stands for YOLO

You know that we are still young
Burn the prints off your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth
So you can't bite your tongue

Only on this earth for a short time, time
So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die

Just take our advice and hide
And scream YOLO to the sky

You oughta look out",YOLO

But I couldn't track the metaphor
That said I can see you horny like a Stegosaur
That said again your request is so irregular
She put on a beard, I started looking at the exit door
Then a turban

Words and truth

One fine evening on the sandy coast
The feeling was irie 'round the drum circle
When the wisest Rasta I ever saw
Gently joined us and sang of Jah
Roots and culture seeped from his bones
He took out a spliff and said ""pass 'dis around""

So I took a righteous drag
It was the best sensi that I ever had
And then I felt the chills run up my back
""My good man, tell me what was that?""
He said ""my friend, you just smoked crack""
You just smoked crack
Ooh, crack
(You just smoked)

I just smoked crack (oh, my God)
It felt fucking great (this is amazing)
I thought it was marijuana, oh yeah
But now it's too fucking late (I can't come back down)
I love crack (holy shit)
And now I am invincible (fuck yeah)
If anyone tries to take my crack
I'll kill them on principle

Some call crack bazooka
Others call it base
But no matter what name you call it
It's the best invention ever by the human race
The government spread lies about it
They say that it is no fun but
On that glass shell I sucky
Sucky-sucky-sucky-til the crack is gone

Now we should legalize it
Legalize it
Set the people free and legalize

We should legalize crack
So that I can smoke it all (I can see God)
You can borrow it from your neighbors
Or buy it at the local mall
(Legalize crack)
I love crack
And I know it loves me (more fire)
So if you try to take my crack
You better fucking kill me

The Lonely Island,"Decisions
This was the hardest day of my life
Should I stay or should I go?
Help me, Lord, to decide

Three blocks from home when she caught my eye
I shouldn't even be looking but she just had to be mine
Ten bedrooms, ten baths, 7,000 square feet
I was weak in the knees, she was the house of my dreams
I had just moved in to the place down the block
And now I'm thinking 'bout moving? Imagine my shock
I talked to my real estate guy, Peter
He was like, ""Your house is beautiful, yo, how could you leave her?
6,000 square feet, a dolphin-themed pool
If I'm being honest, Connor, yo, I think you're a fool
But it's cool, you can definitely afford both places""
Tell me what to do, God, my heart's torn in pieces

So many options and all in my price range
This decision is torture, my head's playing mind games

Should I move? (Should I move y'all?)
Tell me should I buy this new place? (Tell me should I buy it?)
Should I move y'all? (With my money)
It'd be nice to have some more space (More space)

So I turned to my friends playing out by the pool
As I sipped on my drink, I screamed what should I do?
They just shrugged and I could tell that I was on my own
With this decision, no vision, which house to call my home
I had to get away so I flew to Majorca
Dove in the ocean, went swimming with orca
I drank too many piña coladas and fell asleep
Had a dream about both houses and began to weep

Tell me how many houses can one man own?
I'll be paying in cash, got no need for a loan (But still)

Should I move? (Should I move?)
Tell me should I buy this new place? (I don't know what to do)
Should I move y'all? (I think I should just buy it)
It'd be nice to have some more space (I think I'm gon' buy it)

So much pain, so many struggles
But I made it through
I bought the house, it's beautiful
And I kept the old one for my dogs
Sometimes it just works out (Shit works out)
Peace
Oh, and now I own two houses, oh",Should I Move?

All the kings and kingdoms/from beggars to the Czars
Believed me when I told you that/I rose into the stars
I ran and his in Dead Seas/my wife and son set sail
I'm the blood of the Merovingians/houses the Holy Grail
Your excellencies please follow me/seize the reigns of government
I got the power of the Priory/I got the skull called Baphomet
I come down from the Rosy Cross/oh hallowed be my name
I heard the Pope proclaim/I'm the One-the Same
I'm the Anti.../guess my name
I'm the Seducer
Just a Magician/called Religion/your religion
Seducer...

Chorus
You got the passion of an empty mansion
Don't feel no fire when the blood runs cold
There ain't no hurtin' like two hearts uncertain
Ya' can't feel hot when the blood runs cold
When a love's gambe and turns to shambles
Can't mend the pieces when you fall apart
Can't make decisions with mixed suspicions
My coquette cutie with a chameleon heart
You tried to change me, to disarrange me
You lost that attitude you act so old
Too much drinking from too much thinking
Ya' can't feel hot when the blood runs cold
I'm on a junk food diet, I got caught in a riot
My friends all tell me I'm a total mess
You changed our palace to a scene from ""Dallas""
I'm at the party but I'm not a guest
When the blood runs cold
You, a real cruel kind of love for me
You, your real strange way of holding me
Now, there's nothing in this left for me
Chorus to fade

Chorus
Fresh Flesh
Just like a prowling beast
I eat forbidden feast
I love pleasures of the plate
I love dining in the moonlight
Upon your couch of death
I'll suck away your breath
Before you get too cold
Don't like it when you mould
I shed my serpent skin
My reign of terror begins
I stalk among the ruins
Join my dining club-I invite you in
To drink from an unborn child
Coffins have much more style
Please fill one to the lid
With fresh unbaptised kids

I searched through all my possessions
You were no longer one of them
Cried out your name in both and fear
But only silence would answer me
Chorus
I never believed it could happen
Sometimes heaven helps the wicked
Controls the demons from which we can't defend
Lonely I misdirect my horror
You've really left me, this time it's not pretend
Chorus
I turn to catch a dying shadow
Your faded image a-haunting me
I slash my eyes out in a Bunuel mood
I cannot see you in someone else's dream

   Each time the rain starts falling down

It seems the years pass by so quickly
I grew up fast I grew apart

To bury me in the darkest cave
So I may know while I am resting
No rain will fall upon my grave",Rain
The Lost & Found,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

What niggas is really goin through ya understand?

Motherfuckin' down to they last cent
Smoke the looseys
Thinkin' up shit to do
Doin' stick ups and shit

Bustin' at niggas, murderin' niggas
Gettin' bullshit ass money

You know I'm sayin', word up

I'm growing up in the ghetto
And there was nobody happy
And my head is mad nappy and
I'm thinkin' up a way that I can get some dough

Man I'm tryin' ta blow
But yet this record shit is so slow
I got the whole family on my back
All I do is eat and sleep
Run the street with that steel pack

You know the lost boyz got
With timbs and jeans
Field jackets, and hats coverin' the eyes
But listen, that's how it is
If you don't dig how I live

'Cuz everyday on the street
The black man is gettin' beat
Police line us up on the concrete

Now people look at me
And always see wrong
A new problem everyday
I'm tryin' ta be strong

Now how strong can a nigga be
When the blacks is locked down
And the white man's got the key
It's gettin' harder day after day
Somebody got ta pay

And in my closet lays an AK
The new [unverified] is found dead
Plus when he killed the girl
He put the gun to his own head

Ya never hear it on the 6:00 news
When my niggas get killed in the street over tennis shoes
It's hard enough for us blacks to earn cash man
The homeless keep warm by settin' fire to a trash can

Now everyday I need ends
New [unverified] my nigga weed
St. Ides is my best friend
Pa's is broke

No calls comin' in on my phone
And money I'm down to my last stone
My mom dukes is always bangin' on my door
My music's too loud

I got clothes on the floor

She doesn't understand
I'm cruisin' in the fast lane

I'm fresh outta nerves
Ma, you're workin' on my last vein
Now how can I explain
That I don't wanna take her out

But that's stuck in my brain
We're havin' fight after fight
Because I leave when it's bright
And comes home the next night

But that's the life that I live understands me
It's bad enough that Po-Nine tried ta can me

I got three sisters, four brothers
Man, ain't this enough?

He's on the road to riches, baggin' bitches
He's in clubs takin' pitchers, drink your finger always into sess

His lifestyles buck wild, honey child
Got a shorty named Val, she stays on the Isle
He started slingin' at the age of 17
His heart's made of steel, kid his minds full of green

He got his first ounce, made a grand 400
3 bills to get fresh, he other bills to get blunted
And wit the letter G, he bought the letter O
Next thing you know man he's rakin' in the dough

He put his people down 'cuz say that’s only right
For dem to get keys dem and dem is mad tight

It's all the same pain, it's all the same game

Lex, coups and jeeps, got beeps can and lai brew
It's all the same shame, just a different name
Shorty's sniffin' cane, just to maintain'

To a nice shorty, rock O-D'd
(Shorty, what, who, O-D's )
Bring me the chorus
(Shoulda chilled)
Pass me the weed sista
(I would pass the weed)

The lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some die wit the name, some die nameless
It's all the same game, it's all the same pain
It's all the same pain, it's all the same game

The lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some die wit the name, some die nameless
It's all the same game, it's all the same pain
It's all the same pain, it's all the same game

I used to hustle up on Linden in the van
Me and my man did that thing hand in hand
20 bills up, huh, plus a buck 20 sac but verse it
Time to rap but the fiends kept commin' back

I'm tryin' to put my lifestyle in order
The games mad deep, I keep my feet above the water
Caught a bid got a wife and kid
The name just burned in the flame, so out the game I slid

So now I'm into makin' hits wit my men
I hustle wit my style, cook up works wit my pen
Mr. Cheeks represent in the gutter
Freaky Tah, gettin' lai that C's my brudda

In the game and hit you in the brain
And if I was cocaine believe it I'm your main
Tally up it's the Lost Boyz crew an
Freaky Tah, Spigg Nice and Pretty Lou

And it's the lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some die wit the name, some die nameless
It's all the same game, it's all the same pain
It's all the same pain, it's all the same game

The lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some die wit the name, some die nameless
It's all the same game, it's all the same pain
It's all the same pain, it's all the same game

Lifestyles of the rich and shameless
Some die wit the name, some die nameless
It's all the same game, it's all the same pain
It's all the same pain, it's all the same game
...

",Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless
The Lost Boyz,"[Mr.Cheeks ]
Yo we come through like bulls nigga take two puffs and pass 
Nigga watch your back once you talk out your ass 
I back up 3 80 and my stash for protection 
Family is raged the world is acting crazed 
I never thought I'd make it it was hectic when I scrambled 
On point like a knife I'm takin' life as a gamble 
And living in the rotten apple yo where every core is rotten 
All my niggas rest in peace ya see you gone but not forgotten 
Now my main wifey, dead as shaded chicks, 
Official Lost Boyz since the year of 86 
And fuck these crooked niggas I could kill em with a passion, 
At times I feel like slashing in Jamaican Queens fashion 
You think you can fuck around, but kid you're just thinking 
It's over when I'm sober, imagine when I'm drinking 
Without blinking man, I'll tare your crew like pages 
I'll rip you from the backyard of ? ... 

[--A+ ]
A plus the lyrically superb one, spittin rhymes 
Off the top of the tongue to burn ya ear drums 
Rotten shit, make the opposite team call a time out, 
Knockin niggas three times my size out 
The crowd loves me, so when I ain't around they ask for me, 
I buckle up to kick rap like a crash dummy 
For the fast money, I get up in that ass money 
The fact you tryin' to test me kinda bugs me 
I leave crews fed up, like handicap niggas tryin' to get up 
Emcees get wet up with lyrical gun pillars, 
I blow up the spot when it's time to rock 
I speak through a mic my voice peak out at a hundred watts 
Who want to fight son, I get dumb 
Word to my mother the father the holy ghost and Rev Run, 
When the Source set it down, I'm inner serviced 
To cop the type of verses that average emcees seem to worship 

[--Redman ]
My style is milking magnesia, clutch divide speeding bust 
The more the merrier, secure the area, my life familiar 
Is ultimate superior we don't jack cars 
We jack for aircraft carriers 
I bounce like trampolines, when I be blowing the feces to pieces 
Hymn em like sewing machines and Jesus 
When the shadows of the barrel pointing out my (?) Camarro 
I get punished like pharaoh for splittin' 
You're better off singing Christmas carols for Christmas, 
Because I'm on point like bow and arrow equipment 
The president of chicken head conventions 
I give you a deluxe Ku Klux lynchin' 
I got a headache from the stress, success not wearing a vest 
5-11 for being dirty and quarts of 9-30 
Yo, Mr.Cheeks, I made this bitch call police 
She tried swallowing a nine piece 
Forgot the warrantee on false teeth 
I return like Makaveli on 18 inch Pirelli's 
Assault and battery like my palms was ever ready 
Sharp as machete's 
Matter of fact I slap (?) ... 

[--Canibus ]
Canibus brings the sickest drama, 
Fierce enough to pierce the thickest armor 
I smack bitches who try to suck dick through a condom 
Playing with the mic is something I won't do 
My only concern when I approach you, is to roast you 
I smoke you and whoever you standing close to 
And make every man in your crew deny that he knows you 
Defeating, niggas like Segal Steven, 
Putting Emcees in, positions to prevent 'em from breathing 
I'll make you question any and everything you've ever believed in 
By peeping your deepest secrets like psychic readers, 
What's the matter with ya'll, I splatter ya'll 
Against the mutha fuckin wall with these raw lyrics I catapult 
None of ya'll got the balls big enough to battle, 
I go On & On like Erika Badu 
A hundred times nicer than the best there is 
Twice as African as KRS is, who want to test this 
Fuck y'all you don't impress me and no one can test me 
An Emcee so ill, I got AIDS scared to catch me 
All that shit you poppin will stop, when I put you in a headlock, 
And apply pressure until I crush your mutha fuckin noggin 
I grab mics and push niggas to the left 
So fast their hearts end up on the right side of their chests 
My hypothesis, is that nobody can see this 
Lyrical genius, I got it sown like a seamstress 
But if you want to battle, I'm down, 
If you got nine lives, I'll take eight of them off your hands right now 
Step up and get your neck cut from ear to ear 
If you survive, then you can cover your scar with a beard 
I'm the illest from Queens to the new Jerusalem briddicks 
Anyone who ain't feeling my shidick can suck my didick 
You need to quit it, if you ain't spitten 
More than 50 bars per minute cause you ain't in lyrical fitness 
Kickin' boring raps with metaphors that's wack 
All of ya'll mutha fuckas need NordicTrack 
To get ya weight up, fuckin with Canibus you get ate up 
Get beat down and sprayed up, just for bringing my name up 
Been rockin longer than niggas twice my age 
Back in the days before Bob Marley was rockin a fade 
Before Honest Abe signed the paper that freed slaves 
Before Neanderthals was drawing on walls in caves 
I existed, in the garden of Eden gettin lifted 
Stickin dick to Eve before she was Adams mistress 
Before Christ created Christmas, I been in lyrical fitness 
The Canibus is spitten till' he's spitless 
50 bars of total sickness, you won't forget this 
I'm puttin' every wack Emcee alive on my shit list 
Verbally vicious, tele-connectically gifted 
Took you a minute, to exhibit that I'm sick wit it 
Now you tell me who you think is damaging shit 
Going once, going twice 
Sold to that nigga name Canibus 
Me and Mr.Cheeks, A-Plus, and Funk Doctor

The Lost Boyz,"this be a message to the ghetto when will this shit stop
we lost 2 ill niggaz B.I.G and 2pac
this goes to all of us so peep the session from your nigga
you can be loved by millions but one clown can pull the trigga
see you aim to get bigger they break for your downfall
your life is how you living kid just give it your all
we strive to be the best that's what they taught us in the rhyme
smoking weed and getting bent we've all been through hard times
much respect to your hood love is love that's all good
the plan's to make you niggaz understand, understood
yo here's the deal for real you can't get killed from entertaining
but that's all we know cause from the street we got the training

this be a ghetto dedication from my family to yours
how hard is this to explain when it rains kid it pours
instead of bringing ?crime ills? and senseless wars
you niggaz need to expand, buy land, open stores
you talk of revolution but you're very much afraid
take that chip off your shoulder let's all get paid
direct it to the world because we all need peace
we all livin in the belly of the beast

yo, now many lives are lost still to this day we ask the reason
all the suffering we've been through niggaz still is into squeezing
mom dukes on welfare ghetto love no more we share
you rising to the top but then get hit from the rear
one night up in the hood I found my own self thumpin
cause niggaz out there they felt that I owed them something
talk behind my back they don't attack that don't offend me
a 13-year old could just up, and end me
if he wanted to, blunted with the brew in his hand
now does that make shorty rock the man?
not only in your hood but in my hood we lost 2 good fellaz
it's more than what they motherfuckers tell us
now if a cop got shot someone's caught the same night
that's the bullshit you motherfuckin right
so take heed to what I say, LB Fam pray in they own way
to the motherfuckin day

I'm tryin to live a hundred plus in this crazy world
to hold down my fam, Queens, and my baby girl

look here we tryin to make it but they tryin to hold us back
that's why I'm speakin my opinion on this track

throughout the pain I try to gain and keep the shit the same
it's quite strange how these cats keep playin games

Exit from the spot everybody know what's hot

I used to get suspended for keepin' the class jumpin'
Had the blackboard with the chalk in my hand
Mr. Cheeks snatched the thieves off the Canibus plan
watched the crowd get amped

The Lost Boyz,"Baby girl, I salute I salute you
For always bein' truthful
It may sound lame but I truly adore you
And listen I will always go out for you
There's nothin' in the world a cat won't do
To show that his love is true for you
We'll take walks through the park at night
Spread love in the dark that's right
Once I had mad women on my list
On the real none ever made me feel like this
I wasn't frontin' when I said that I want you
Even though it took some time to confront you
We at home in the zone elaboratin'
I'm lovin' you, you lovin' me we be marinatin'
As long as we keep it tight and build this communication
We'll build a stronger foundation

(I feel your love, it's so love . . .)
I ain't afraid to go where some niggas won't
(I feel your love, it's so love . . .)
We ain't afraid to do what some niggas won't

Put you through hard times but you still stay by my side
I provide anything that you want and need
But you don't mess with my liquor nor weed
Word to moms we could travel this world
See youse my wife no longer my girl
See people mad at the thing we got
Cause we come through the spot lookin' hot, why not
Is it a crime at times when I nag you
I know shiesty cats that wanna bag you
It's all good in my hood I did it too
What the hell this cat think he can do for you
That I don't, haven't already done
I used to deal with wicked chicks I found a steady one
As long as we keep it tight, build this communication
We'll build a stronger foundation

(I feel your love, it's so love . . .)
I ain't afraid to go where some niggas won't
(I feel your love, it's so love . . .)
We ain't afraid to do what some niggas won't

I know you've had your flashbacks of what we been through
But it's a whole different story when I mean you
Make it down to respect and protect you
And if any men disrespect you
Been through downs and ups, ups and downs
I wrote this here from the gut, how that sound
I lay it down while my man Chuck sings to you impressions
I bring to you glamourous life only for the wife
So others never give it baby livin' trife
Cherishin' all the moments that's excitin'
It's probably all of that cause I live fightin'
If you feelin' bored get your thing on
If I really didn't know you why'd I ring on
As long as we keep it tight and build this communication
We'll build a stronger foundation
 
(I feel your love, it's so love . . .)
I ain't afraid to go where some niggas won't
(I feel your love, it's so love . . .)
We ain't afraid to do what some niggas won't

Well listen Summer time in the city
Now niggas ride around town, for another sounds, look before the smithy
And even on ball courts, you got the shorties watchin fellas
Doin anythings on they baggy shorts
And kids is having fun in the park
But there's a limit, moms says you best to be home before dark
Now we all know the flavor, were back on the black moms
Chattin with the next door neighbour sayin ""Hi""
The folks that don't ride
Her hands on the floor head 'cause the sun keeps gettin in the rock
Little kids in sweaty suits, with niggas like Lost Boyz
Strictly t-shirts or the boots
Standin on the van with, I'm wavin at chicks
Takin food from the vooda, and sips from the Mystics
Lex, coups, beemers and benz
Niggas hangin with they man makin hits
We bouncin in the city

Chorus: 4X
Summer, summer, summer time (summer time in the city)

[Mr. Cheeks]
In every borough there's a crew
Of niggas smokin blunts and drinkin brew
'cause that's the way that us niggas do
With Newports in the ear, playin concrete sports
And shorties walk around in daisy dukes shorts, bounce
The would be throwin jams in the park
When the buddha is sparked, they get together after dark
GG and G tapes are bangin, it's strictly Spigg Nice
And that hat black, when me and my niggas are sayin
I'm given beats to my peeps when I pass through
In 89, 'cause them shorties smoke grass too
To make a avenue, somethin in god rule
40 be, that is lee, agent I too
And to my peoples on the rock
132142, yeah that's the rock
See Queens niggas do they thing
Champagne and rings don't hold shit, 
bang real niggas hang in the city

Chorus 4X
[Mr. Cheeks]
It's about 98 degrees, everybodies gettin cheese
And a downy in my round, spit is walk around in dungaries
When new burgers got a lot around the corner
See a shorty and you want, now you best to push up on her, right?
I lay my act, slick sleen back, 40 ounce down south
Bounce bounce like that
Smokin charm as we creep through the streets
Lost Boyz, they bites and they eat meats
They blues, no socks, short skirts, t-shirts, red Reebok
Shorty bouncin with friends
3 piece, bbs, cloned out on the Benz
I want to hit in the car, how them skins feel
Shorty with the ribbon in the windshield
So one two, this is how we do
Summer time, Lost Boyz comin through in the city

""Now"" 

I'm in this tight situation
I'm at this chicks crib uptown 
Niggaz try to come through and lock me down 
Now it seems like a set-up 
and niggaz try to wet me from the door 
Half a second of gun blaze then I'm in my detour 
Shot through the glass hit the balcony 
How could she set me up like that?
I caught my balance, shot back 
I'm jettin down the fire escape I started sprayin
I'm takin five steps at a time enemy is gaining
on me, my niggaz tried to warn me when my steppin
It's good though cause on a low a nigga had his weapon
I'm jettin down this dead end thrill
I hit the street I got no jacket on my back 
But I got my Tim's on my feet 
when my life broke across me back against the wall
I'm lookin for my enemies I'm searchin for them all
No bullets being fired so now a nigga's jettin to the corner
that's where most of the people settin
I break-away my burner now I'm searchin for the train
The only motherfucker with no coat I'm in the rain
There's beef walkers walkin I gotta play it cool 
Even though he's firm with that I walk covered up my jewel
I'm in a tight situation? 

""Black B the shit went down world wide B""

""Word, what happened?""

""Yo nigga started mouthing off
I don't know if nigga's still breathing
All I know is that I made moues""

""Well yo, 8 moues I'ma need you my fault
I'll meet you there""

""Aight""

...real in this battlefield violence being born 
Get your shit in a year, but prepare for war

I ain't showin nobody love I'm holdin no conversation
I cop me a (???) a few Dutch's now I'm out 
That's Queens for some ammo, no doubt

Now listen money, can you tell that me to the E, hey?
I'm going through this bullshit at 3:53 in the morning 
Word to moms I can't believe she tried to hit me 
I knew something was fishy but she said she comin to get me 
Talkin about my work and talkin she bring me back
but on the low I didn't notice she'll be robbing when the jack

Jumped off the rock-away it's just a block away from Planners
The block is rather hot they got surveillance tapes and cameras
I seen none of my peeps up on the streets so I keep movin
He follows with de-cursing em I know that some of my crew been hurt
My mind need a touch I roll a touch up while I'm walkin 
I take a step for step dolo Dutch and my toilets and my cells
Can't put my finger on just what happened

I go downtown cause it's fresh plus she lets me
Rub it the right way like Johnny Gill would say
I'm glad you feel that way sometimes we just chill and lay
In the sack I rub her back when we're resting
It was love at first sight my confession
She know who she is can't say her name
Cause if I do I wont be true to my game
Word up

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go
Yo I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go

Now, my next one she lives out of state
I mean the sex and conversation situation is great
Everytime I hit town we make a date
And when it's time to chill my shorty cant wait
Now I can still remember when we first met eachother
Exchanged numbers promised we wont forget eachother
Goes to work and school
That's cool 
No doubt that's why a nigga went that route
No form foot locker
Shorty lookin proper
She's out to get me can't stop her
Know I had a lover 
Yo still went for her
Even copped a bed and kicks on the strength of her
Yo chatted talkin bout see you later
From that moment on I knew that I had to date her
Couldn't conversate long 
Shorty had to go back to work 
Something inside said that will work

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go
Yo I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go

I thought I couldn't live with chicks cause they be to demanding
Especially the ones that's never understanding
Like
Who was that? Where you goin? Who you out with?
Them same niggas I make moves and I shout with
Don't let these niggas in the street get your head up
Like they can do better than me
Plus I'm fed up
I had to tell my main chick that one time
Thinkin to me short 
She thought that I'm
Some clown nigga she can scream on and talk to 
I had to run her down the line this aint no walk through 
Now who the fuck you think you talkin to chick
Your complaining's makin me sick 
Understand man I tried to do my thing
Yo understand I played the puppet on the string
Like I say everyday I be there fo rmy friend
Good things always come to an end
So yo

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go
Yo I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go

See the moral of this is that I really do care
But I'm not afraid to go there
Very unselfish and yes I do share
You could have your bitch but you gets nowhere
Word
She began by saying try after try
It's a done deal
Now I'm singing byebye
All I tried to do was keep you satisfied
Never dealing with no others I try
To many threats kid 
Got to let her go
Always in your corner 
Got to let her know
As I grab my coat and painfully walked out
Hands about to give
We talked out
I'm feeling pain as it come to an end
I said to shorty ""I will always be your friend""
Now if you ever need me I will be right there
I aint going nowhere
For real

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go
Yo I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I dont want to let none of them go

The Lost Boyz,"[Mr. Cheeks]
You know the life situations, hard times of deep conversations
Beef in the streets, eliminations
Shit gets iller, it's mad bullshit us niggas go through
They hate us, being broke and gettin dough too
Well let me show you, niggas how I feel when I'm singin
Ya niggas be constantly O.D.'ing
You can't show them crackers love, yo they love to take advantage
Keep actin like ya black watch where ya land bitch
A word from the wise, you know us
The late street slummers
We creep on you with rentals, no hummers
We celebrate the summers, burn trees sit up on the bench
Against the fench, watchin tournaments
These niggas know the scene, niggas roll dice for the green
Bitches the more ice the mean
Keep the cars shining, these love the creep through the actional
And that the hood the fuckin main attraction
The hot bitches and niggas ayo we all make it happen
Sword sellin drugs are workin hard, we all rappin
Hope you recognize the realism, that I'm spittin
Not the hardest rap artist, but I'm hittin
Put the Gennus to my lip take a sip of it
Light my L, write my rhyme watch how I flip the shit
Ayo ya niggas ya be counterfeit, so tone it down a bit
A move along with you bullshit

Chorus: Lost Boyz & Mel
You can't hold us down, You can't hold us down
You can't hold us down, You can't fuck around

[Mr. Cheeks]
I creep the streets with my sounds blastin from the get up
Lay back confortable, why the fuck sit up
Rims shining, ordinary guy, makin cheddar
Life for me and wifey and for the kid it's more better
Better school and yo niggas makin better more
Like some old addition listen kid, cheddar roots
Kid you feelin me, these rap niggas killin me
Shit my team through police they be drillin me
Niggas thrillin me, I shine like the diamond
For real a fuckin wit you money kid I'm only rhymin
But if you wanna get it on, yo we can do it
Any business that's mine yo I'm steppin to it
Livin life with no fear
My teams got my back and my rear
Niggas if you want me, I'm right here
Talkin out ya mouth, runnin out with gems and can't win
These DJ's makin tapes and can't spin
These rap niggas, makin money but they really trash
Niggas frontin like they want Parelli ass
Aiyo I pass, I'd rather listen to some R&B
Some hot shit maybe starrin me

Chorus 2X

[Mr. Cheeks]
It seems that my minds playin games on me
Police stay harass try to throw the chains on me
And try to warn me once I got up inside the game
Niggas told me that shit would never be the same
Niggas chains what money comes around the set
Niggas told me though so a nigga won't forget
Where I came from, you know the fuckin scoop
Police hate to see us cats when we on the stoop
Know the best, are whips caught sword in the chest
Knowin that we enter murder, money and the sex
Drugs, fuck with honeys who be hustlin for cheddar
They only out to make it better
Startin where it comes from
We used to sell those drums too
We represent the slums boo
How we do basically no doubt, LB Fam IV Life, yo we out

Families seem like the real enemy
A true, true friends of me is trees and Hennessy
I love the ghetto life, FDR city lights
Burnin L's inside the truck, duckin blue and whites
I play two parts to this, negative and positive
But bottom line, understand man I gotta live

The mad junction, can't let it stress me
I'm at my best, son ya best won' test me?
Once again it's on, official burn out
Don't look, puzzled ???? faces how it turn out
Once in a while I take the train just to clear the brain
People ask me 'what's the deal kid, it's just the same'
You know the night-runners, nothin major
Don't let me and my bullshit invade ya
I know you probably, got problems of ya own
No need for you to zone
Understand, I love this game, it mean a great deal to me
It's my life, can you image how it feel to be?

(Hook)
I remember when ????????
It don't even to start me to reminiscin
About the past when we wasn't gettin no cash
Had the skills, but like a hot chick wit no ass
It meant nada, I gotta get my gid on
I need some chedda in my pocket, hot shit on
The lifestyle'll be butter like the wife's smile
Make a habit, don't break, it may take a while
I'm a hustla, I'ma hustle til the end, too
Starin at that, evil that us men do
Basically it's LB fam all night
And ain't nothin wrong doin it all night

Wonder how long hard times will last
For this backward soul on a road that god knows where
As hard as I try ain't left no track

Singing why me, oh why me
And I throw another empty bottle up against the wall
And I say why me, oh why me
But pitty never ever did me any kinda good at all
So I walk on

And I wound up on the capital steps
Watching the lobbyists smoking cigarettes
And bury their shoes in the country club blues
And who got who by the short hairs

Standing there in their high dollar suits
Looking down at my tattered old jeans and boots
And this weathered guitar that seems to follow me everywhere
God it follows me everywhere

Playing why me, oh why me
All I got's another song about how money makes and breaks the law
And I sing why me, oh why me
I'm just a broke troubadour with a bark for the underdog
So I walk on

Now I ain't Jesus, but I can relate
To a man looking death square in the face
Even he hit his knees with a plea in the garden of Gethsemane
To his holy father he raised his eyes
In his darkest hours he cried
Please would you take this cup from me

Praying why me, oh why me
Knowing all the while he had to carry that cross and hang there
When I say why me, oh me
I know that somewhere up in heaven there's a big old book with my name there

The Lounge-O-Leers,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

It was all a bunch of mush that I just did not want
Paid was the issue of the day
If a girlfriend's got some game
Couldn't be more fly, gettin' paid was everything
But I'm not every girl and I don't need that world to validate me
Cuz shorty's got a job, shorty's got a car, shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

I was a girl about the floss
It was all about the cost, how much he spent on me
Seek, for a man who's got the means
To be givin' you diamond rings
It's what every fly girl could want or even dream
But I'm not every girl and I don't need no G to take care of me
Cuz shorty's got a job, shorty's got a car, shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart, no no

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,

Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up?  Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

[Chorus]

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
For four hours and you just said, ""No.""
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you
You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither,
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan, P.S.
We should be together too
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window

Dear Mister ""I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans"",
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, 
Shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

[Chorus]

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother,
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog,
Come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to

You can see him and hear him in this world every day
Satan is real, working with power
He can tempt you and lead you astray

I attended service at a little church in the country not long ago
A prayer was led by an old country preacher
Who then raised his hands as everyone stood and sang
""My God is real""
A warm breeze through the open windows
Brought in the smell of new mown hay in a nearby field
And the singing of birds could be heard in the moment of silence
As the preacher opened the bible to read
And then a little old man stood up, bent with age
His hair thin and white
And said, ""preacher, tell them that satan is real too""
You can hear him in songs that give praise to idols
And sinful things of this world
You can see him in the destruction of homes torn apart
I know that satan is real
For once I had a happy home
I was loved and respected by my family
I was looked upon as a leader in my community
And then Satan came into my life
I grew selfish and un-neighborly
My friends turned against me
And finally, my home was broken apart
My children took their paths into a world of sin
Yes preacher, it's sweet to know that God is real
And know that in Him all things are possible
And we know that Heaven is a real place
Where joy shall never end
But sinner friend, if you're here today

To turn back the time and be a boy again and see the sun come up every morning
A quarter of a mile to the grocery store school bus came within a mile off my door

And here in distance of a cotton gin a thirty minute walk to Ruby
Oh I'd walk it in the moonlight oh I'd walk it on the dark night
Rain or shine this heart of mine craved Ruby's company
Oh she could kiss me just right oh but I was a little too shy
For I got the nerve to make my move Ruby got away from me

Oh I'd walk it in the moonlight",Ruby's Song

Don't make my heart believe it's long tell me you want me too
Let me go with you don't leave me I'll miss you I'm scared of the blues
Scared of the blues

Let me go with you and I'll never let you get lonesome
Let me be near you and my love is yours when you need someone

I read in my Bible, they shall not enter in
For Jesus will answer, ""depart, I never knew you""
That word broadminded is spelled s-i-n

And drink a little whiskey just to please a friend
They say it's really nothing, you've got to be broadminded

That broadminded mother goes out and joins a party
There's nothing wrong in drinking and dancing with a friend
And then on Sunday morning, she'll say she loves her savior
She should be begging God to forgive her of her sin

I read in my Bible, they shall not enter in
For Jesus will answer, Depart, I never knew you
That word broadminded is spelled s-i-n

For to be carnally minded is death
But to be spiritually minded is life and peace
Because the carnal mind is enmity against God
For it is not subject to the law of God
Neither, indeed, can be

The Louvin Brothers,"I met a liitle girl in Knoxville, a town we all know well
And every Sunday evening, out in her home, I'd dwell
We went to take an evening walk about a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground and knocked that fair girl down

She fell down on her bended knees, for mercy she did cry
""Oh Willy dear, don't kill me here, I'm unprepared to die""
She never spoke another word, I only beat her more
Until the ground around me within her blood did flow

I took her by her golden curls and I drug her round and around
Throwing her into the river that flows through Knoxville town
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl with the dark and rolling eyes
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl, you can never be my bride

I started back to Knoxville, got there about midnight
My mother, she was worried and woke up in a fright
Saying ""dear son, what have you done to bloody your clothes so?""
I told my anxious mother I was bleeding at my nose

I called for me a candle to light myself to bed
I called for me a handkerchief to bind my aching head
Rolled and tumbled the whole night through, as troubles was for me
Like flames of hell around my bed and in my eyes could see

They carried me down to Knoxville and put me in a cell
My friends all tried to get me out but none could go my bail
I'm here to waste my life away down in this dirty old jail
Because I murdered that Knoxville girl, the girl I loved so well",Knoxville Girl

The mailman brings the letters by just like he did before

And realize you're gone

And wait for day to come

It must go on alone

And we read that John The Baptist met Him there
And when John baptized Jesus in Jordan's rushing waters
The mighty power of God filled the air
I'm on my way to the River Of Jordan
Gonna wade right in to the rushing waters
I'm going down, I'm going down to the River Of Jordan
And let the cool waters cleanse my soul

King Naaman was stricken with dreaded leprosy
And he sent for the man of God to pray
But Elisha said to Naaman ""go dip yourself in Jordan""
And let the cool waters wash your spots away

So he went right down to the River Of Jordan
He waded right in the rushing waters
He dipped himself, he dipped himself in the River Of Jordan
And the cool waters made him whole

The River Of Jordan is many miles away
And this mighty river I may never see
But I'll find myself an altar in an old-fashioned church
And my River of Jordan, that will be

And missed your graduation so you say
Well it's time to find somebody new to believe in

You seem to me the type of girl that men forget
From face to face to back to bed
You spend most your time 
Walking off the letdowns

But the hardest thing for you 
Is just to let that bell ring true and everybody knows

A little rain must fall, everybody knows
A little rain must fall

Well I should be the one to talk
But I seem OK, not worth a damn or so they say
Well I wish that boy would find one thing he can believe in 

I used to be the type to cry but now I laugh 
From wall street hippie to sociopath
I spend most of my time
Walking off the letdowns

But the hardest thing to do
Is just to let that bell ring true and everybody knows

[Chorus]
A little rain must fall everybody knows
A little rain must fall but we can wait it out together
You see it never lasts forever and everybody knows
A little rain must fall

Now I know I'll find the sunshine to soothe me when I'm needy
And I know this is just a little rise in the road
And I can feel my luck is changing and it's rising up to greet me
And I can see there's just a little farther to go
Oh but right now everybody knows

Well the sun comes up in different ways in Rockwell paintings and Hemingway
Now who do you suppose those two fools believed in
Is it just a stroke of luck fat chance or is it just a matter of circumstance
Well perfection sure get's boring anyway
But tomorrow's another day 
And everybody knows

is that the light from the sun going down, or is that the light from the sun about to rise
and is it time to go to sleep, cuz goddam i am tired

did you see the fireflies as they danced their song all along the riverside
did you hear the wildcat growl, i think he must be lonely tonight

should i talk to a friend and tell her it's for real this time
should i walk to the end of the universe and say goodbye

And all thses victories have been bittersweet

Remember how we let these grapes turn so sour...""

You torn out what's left of my faith in
You I guess I'm too old to pretend

And tryin' ta get a drink of water with his knees gettin' mud caked
And I'll tell you and exceptance how he stumbled into Memphis Tennessee

Get sister run quickly to the dusty closet shelf
And pull out a washboard; and play a guitar chord
And do a little do it yourself
Call on your neighbors to put down their labors
And come and play the hardware in time

Greased with suntan lotion
When I got wiped out by a beach boy

And he dragged me by the armpit like a child's toy
As we staggerd into land with all the waitors eatin' sandwiches
We tried to mooch a towel from the hoi poloi

That was landin' on the floor

Whee, ker-pow!
Somehow I would've met you anyhow
You fix it up and then, oh holy cow
You folks are gonna see me now

Well, I finally got so fed up I was off to blow my head off
With the gun in the cash box at the store
Then I thought I'd grab a fistful just in case I weren't successful
But instead I got my tie caught in the drawer

When you're riding down the road at 100 miles an hour
And a guy's ahead hitchin' someplace
Honey, don't you be surprised, I'll be wipin' out my eyes
As you pass me, leavin' dust in my face

The Lovin' Spoonful,"Why must every generation think their folks are square
And no matter where their heads are they know mom´s ain´t there
'Cause I swore when I was small that I´d remember when
I knew what´s wrong with them that I was smaller then

Determined to remember all the cardinal rules
Like sun showers are legal grounds for cutting school
I know I have forgotten maybe one or two
And I hope that I recall them all before the baby´s due
And I know he´ll have a question or two

Like ""hey Pop, can I go ride my zoom
It goes two hundred miles an hour suspended on balloons
And can I put a droplet of this new stuff on my tongue
And imagine frothing dragons while you sit and wreck your lungs""
And I must be permissive, understanding of the younger generation

Then I´ll know that all I´ve learned my kid assumes
And all my deepest worries must be his cartoons
And still I´ll try to tell them him all the things I´ve done
Relating to what he can do when he becomes a man
And still he´ll stick his fingers in the fan

And ""Hey, Pop, my girlfriend´s only three
She´s got her own videophone and she´s taking L.S.D.
And now that we´re best friends she wants to give a bit to me
But what´s the matter Daddy, how come you´re turning green?
Can it be that you can´t live up to your dreams?""",Younger Generation

Oh darlin' try this one
If you need a friend
I've got the cure for
The shape that you're in

The Low Anthem,"I was in the air when the towers came down
In a bar on the 84th floor
I bought Philippe Petit a round
And asked what his high wire was for
He said, 'I put one foot on the wire,
One foot straight into heaven'
As the prophets entered boldly into the bar
On the Boeing 737, Lord, on the Boeing 737
Hey little bird, would you be the one
To nest beneath my Gatling gun?
There's nothing left I call my own
Come down and build me a home.

I was in a bar when they rigged the towers
Trying to leave all my sins
The barmaid asked my order
And where my mind had been
I tried to recall the high wire
Philippe and his foot in heaven
As the prophets entered boldly into the bar
On the Boeing 737, Lord, on the Boeing 737
Hey little bird, would you be the one
To nest beneath my Gatling gun?
There's nothing left I call my own
Come down and build me a home.",Boeing 737
The Low Anthem,"Did I burn each last bit of myself
Did I turn my back on the kid in myself
And tear the oldest root
In a charlatan's pursuit
And the world drifting father away

On the run with nowhere to ride
The black angel still clings to my side
You know he's faster than
Any man
And the world drifting father away

What I told you lover I guess that I meant
By the time that you read this I will have repented
I know I am a fool
For trying to play it cruel
And you played so much kinder than I

Your memory know is the shadow to my shadow
I wind it tight like a player piano
Your skirt above your knees
I watch you press the keys
It calms the smarting flesh
Of the wound we have undressed

If still there's a song deep in this marrow
Who lets you draw that last shivering arrow
What kind of smarting loon
Believes that he can shoot the moon
Calm these failing nerves
They ask to be preserved

I was ashamed and mute
Fumbling around for my parachute
Then gliding through the rain
Not a drop could leave its stain
And the world drifting farther away",Burn
The Low Anthem,"As the blind walk the blind
Through the blackness of freedom
Who writes the songs
That we all will be singin'

Who writes the books
When I lay my head down open
Swore to swear myself
Into your face

As the blind walk the blind
At the border-less highway
Who holds the chains?
Who bears the load?

Don't you be fooled
If my spirit's hung and broken
Stroll in the next life
Our fortunes are opened

And we're not to reach
If the sermon I have written
Stand on some sofas
Bear with our hands

And those who reach well
Will be farmed by some industry
It herds the golden cattle
Before insecure eyes

As the blind walk the blind
Through the blackness of freedom
Who writes the songs
That we all will be singin'

Who writes the books
When I lay my head down open
Swore to swear myself
Into your face",Golden Cattle
The Low Anthem,"Please don't rush me
I'm over the moon
I ain't yet fit to come down

A rose is a rose
A balloon a balloon
You've got to go right now

Go get a job
Don't work for your father
He ain't no salt of the earth
In your soft little palms
Beneath the Hollywood palms
You might just do well by some work

Hey all you hippies you've got a bad name
Ever since your let your guard down
Here comes Ronald Regan from the Hollywood Hills
Don't look like he's fooling around

Now you know how they feel
You're hip to the steel
Strutting so bold and loose

Your pray to God for luck
But the reconnaissance truck
Is watching your every move

You wanted to fish
And to live off the grid
You said life should be easy and free

But just one bad actor
And his benefactors
Can bring the old girl to her knees

Hey all you hippies you've got a bad name
Ever since your let your guard down
Here comes Ronald Regan from the Hollywood Hills
Don't look like he's fooling around

Do these firework charades
And the low flying planes
Stir you patriotic voice to sing

To each flickering flag
On the Arlington lawn
For each pawn who has fell for his king

Hey all you hippies you've got a bad name
Ever since your let your guard down
Here comes Ronald Regan from the Hollywood Hills
Don't look like he's fooling around
Here comes Ronald Regan from the Hollywood Hills
Don't look like he's fooling around","Hey, All You Hippies!"
The Low Anthem,"It's a sad and guilty feeling
Since I did not take out your ashes
Whatever I was fearing
Never came to passing

It's a sad and prideful feeling
Since I did not drive you to Michigan
Scrambling eggs and bacon
And you're right here in the kitchen

I've got plans and dreams and all kinds of schemes
And now I'm beyond all repair
But time just ain't no healer
With your ashes sitting there

I know you have been counting on me
Since your sad cremation day
I've combed house of this poetry
For all that I wished for it to say

It's a sad and guilty feeling
Since I did not take out your ashes
Whatever I was fearing
Never came to passing",I'll Take Out Your Ashes
The Low Anthem,"As the water finds the cracks
Birds pick the highways clean
Crucifix across my shoulder blades
Got your name tattooed between
So you say the root is dry
As you flash the old-time camera
And hide your songs of anguish
In dying language
Never saw no rainbow sign
No meaning was I offered
To love is to pay
Lay your wealth upon the altar
So we share a couple songs
Here in the desert hotel
While they’re tearing up the highway
Here to Santa Bell",Love and Altar
