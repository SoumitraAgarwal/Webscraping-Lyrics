Gérald De Palmas,"Ne me demandez pas l'heure, je n'en ai aucune idée 
Ni l'adresse de mon docteur, je n'y vais plus depuis le mois de mai 
Une maladie tropicale ? C'est peut-être ce que j'ai attrapé 
A moins que mon histoire soit plus banale, et qu'il n'y a rien de compliqué 
 
Rose a posé ses lèvres sur ma bouche 
Rien ne m'atteint, non plus rien ne me touche 
Rose a posé ses lèvres sur ma bouche... bée 
Sur ma bouche bée 

De ma journée que dois-je faire ? Je n'en ai aucune idée 
Changer le monde ou bien me taire, je n'ai pas encore décidé 
Où j'habite ? Quel est mon nom ? J'ai bien peur de l'avoir oublié 
Mais bon sang comment s'y prend-elle ? Je passe mon temps à l'observer 

Rose a posé ses lèvres sur ma bouche  
Rien ne m'atteint, non plus rien ne me touche  
Rose a posé ses lèvres sur ma bouche... bée 
Sur ma bouche bée 

Rose a posé ses lèvres sur ma bouche  
Rien ne m'atteint, non plus rien ne me touche  
Rose a posé ses lèvres sur ma bouche... bée
Sur ma bouche bée",Rose
Gérald De Palmas,"Mon coeur pèse une tonne quand mon réveil sonne 
Le souffle court, qui appelait au secours ? 
Il y a sur cette Terre beaucoup trop de choses à faire 
Mon coeur pèse une tonne quand le téléphone sonne, 
Tétanisé je ne pourrai pas décrocher 
Quelle nouvelle catastrophe va-t-on encore m'annoncer? 

Je voudrais sortir pour voir qui je suis 
Sortir et pousser un cri 
Cette nuit, il faut que je sache qui je suis 

Mon coeur pèse une tonne quand à ma porte on sonne 
Ne pas faire de bruit, caché au fond de mon lit 
La télé allumée pour me tenir compagnie 

Je voudrais sortir pour voir qui je suis 
Sortir et pousser un cri 
Cette nuit, il faut que je sache qui je suis 

Bien enfermé dans ma cage, prisonnier d'un esprit trop sage 
Je voudrais sortir pour voir qui je suis 
Sortir et pousser un cri 
Cette nuit, il faut que je sache qui je suis 
Sortir pour voir qui je suis 
Sortir et pousser un cri 
Cette nuit il faut que je sache qui je suis 
Sortir...",Sortir
Gérald De Palmas,"A quoi bon résister alors que tout le monde le sait 
Bon dernier au courant... 
... je suis un garçon un peu lent. 

Sous la pluie je t'ai vue 
Je t'ai vue l'enlacer sous la pluie 
Pourquoi l'as-tu embrassé sous la pluie ? 
Je sais maintenant que tu l'as fait 
Je sais maintenant ce que ça fait 

Aujourd'hui c'est la guerre, ... 
... demain j'y croirai dur comme fer 
Je n'ai qu'à oublier, ici bas je ne fais que passer 

Sous la pluie je t'ai vue 
Je t'ai vue l'enlacer sous la pluie 
Pourquoi l'as-tu embrassé sous la pluie ? 
Je sais maintenant que tu l'as fait 
Je sais maintenant ce que ça fait 
 

Un autre bleu à mon âme, 
Un autre morceau de titane,... 
... pour mon armure d'homme 

Sous la pluie, je t'ai vue 
Je t'ai vue l'enlacer sous la pluie 
Pourquoi l'as-tu embrassé sous la pluie ? 
Je sais maintenant que tu l'as fait 
Je sais maintenant ce que ça fait 
 
A quoi bon résister, alors que tout le monde le sait
A quoi bon résister, je sais maintenant que tu l'as fait
Je sais maintenant ce que ça fait",Sous La Pluie
Gérald De Palmas,"You wanna know the secret 
Hoping sheʼll release it 
What you want and tell her what you needed 
You can taste it, better you donʼt waste it 
Go ahead, go firing up your greed now 
Not tonight, donʼt just hold it 
Thatʼs all right 
Go in and get a hit now 
Might be different, need to know the content
Now you're sicker yes you need a beer
 
Tell me what you got in the box right now 
Tell me what you got in the box right now
You gotta tell me what you got in the box right now
Tell me what you got in the box right now 
 
Iʼve got no excuse for what Iʼve done 
What Iʼve become 
Youʼve got no excuse 
The sun is gone 
Whatʼs done is done
 
I think I ought to mention 
Many have been tempted 
want to know what secret she's been keeping
Try to break it and still you didnʼt make it 
Lost your hair not getting what you're seeking 
Once you find it, what you gonna do then 
And if sheʼs lying oh you gonna go back home now 
Wonʼt forsake it as long as you can take it 
Crazy fool reminding me of me 

Tell me what you got in the box right now 
Tell me what you got in the box right now
You gotta tell me what you got in the box right now
Tell me what you got in the box right now 
 
Iʼve got no excuse for what Iʼve done 
What Iʼve become 
No youʼve got no excuse 
The sun is gone 
Whatʼs done is done

Tell me what you got in the box right now 
Tell me what you got in the box right now
You gotta tell me what you got in the box right now
Tell me what you got in the box right now 
Tell me what you got in the box right now 
Tell me what you got in the box right now
Why don't you tell me what you got in the box right now

Gérald De Palmas,"Je prends les choses comme elles viennent 
Sans jamais trop poser de questions 
Je suis trop fort pour qu’on me retienne 
Je suis un guerrier, un centurion 
J’aime nager derrière la barrière de corail 
Pour mieux voir l’horizon 
J’ai pas peur de me jeter dans la bataille 
Demain je danserai au son du canon 
Au son du canon 

Roule moi une pelle, saute moi au cou 
Embrasse-moi avant que je m’en aille 
Tu sais on ne va pas se voir beaucoup 
Je m’en vais le jour de nos fiançailles 
Je veux m’en souvenir, je veux marquer le coup 
Ne faisons pas dans le détail 
Je veux qu’on fasse l’amour comme des fous 
Je m’en vais le jour de nos fiançailles 
Le jour de nos fiançailles 

Je croyais que j’étais du bon coté 
Les autres en face avaient tords 
En tout cas c’est ce que disait l’opinion quand elle ouvrait sa grande gueule 
Un jour vivant mais demain je serai mort 
Ma jolie fiancée va se retrouver seule 
Se retrouver seule 

Roule moi une pelle, saute moi au cou 
Embrasse-moi avant que je m’en aille 
Tu sais on ne va pas se voir beaucoup 

Je m’en vais le jour de nos fiançailles 
Je veux m’en souvenir, je veux marquer le coup 
Ne faisons pas dans le détail 
Je veux qu’on fasse l’amour comme des fous 
Je m’en vais le jour de nos fiançailles 

Mes parents pleurent, ils ont la haine 
Ils n’ont jamais rien compris à cette guerre 
Laisse-les parler ils ont tant de peine 
C’est avec les honneurs qu’on m’enterre 

Roule moi une pelle, saute moi au cou 
Embrasse-moi avant que je m’en aille 
Tu sais on ne va pas se voir beaucoup 
Je m’en vais le jour de nos fiançailles

Fulfilling our wildest dreams

Watching my every move in sight
And you don't need those
Kind of worries
To be messin' your
Messin' your mind

Girl you know that I'm
Not that kind of guy
And you need to just ask yourself why
Would I waste my time
To commit such a crime
Lose the best thing
I have in my life

Someone's trying to come between me
and you
Can't you see what they're trying to do
They can't stand to see something so right
See two people so satisfied

Somebody if anybody, someone told me
That when you go out they say you're
So nice
Somebody, nobody had to tell me
That you danced and talked with lots
Of guys
And I don't know why they feel
The need to let me know that you've
Had a good time
Maybe they thought that I would
Get jealous get upset with you
And start a fight

But they don't understand that the
Love we have is much stronger
Than they can conceive
There's no jealousy, there's no need
To be, 'cause my lady only lays
Down with me

See I'm down with this girl, she's my
Whole wide world and she's down
With her man, they don't seem to 
Understand
We've got a love that's honest and true.
No one will ever come between us two
And everybody so confused, but it ain't
Nobody's business what we do

You I won't be there

Coming home late
When it comes down to this love
Baby, I won't make you wait
See, no one really knows
All the hell you been through
Oh, I swear to make it up to you, baby 
Cross my heart, hope to die

I've been lying and I'm cheating sleeping
Round with everyone
There's no future I'm gonna lose her

Take your love away from me
Don't take it away, no
Without you I can't eat, breathe or sleep

You'll be takin' my sunshine, rainbows
You don't want to do that girl
It'd be like takin' away a baby's
Ice cream, sprinkles
And I know you're not that kind of girl

You never said that you had plans to leave me
But I thought I tell you while
I had the chance and a love this strong
For so many ways, it was too late
To express the happiness
Don't know what to do
After the love is gone
They can't even carry on

Don't take it away, no
Take your love away from me
Don't take it away, no
Without you I can't eat, breathe or sleep

See with you I'm complete
Girl, you are so sweet
Nothing can compare to you being there
You see, girl you know that I'll respect you
I never would neglect my responsibility to love you
So don't take it from me, no
No, no, no, no
Don't take it away
Don't take it away

Don't take it away, no
Take your love away from me
Don't take it away, no
Without you I can't eat, breathe or sleep

Heart don't tell me I'm wrong again
Cause that would be whack
And I don't want to be that
Heart don't tell me I'm wrong again
Cause it wouldn't be fun
I think I've found the right one yeah

Not another gold digger
It's just my luck, go figure
The good ones always pass me by
They always go to the next guy
Or I always get the one
Everybody else has done
Give her everything, I keep her lace
I must have sucker on my face

What the deal is?
I don't deserve this
When I met her she said
She had her own apartment
I believe her
Tell me why is they always lying?
It was her system
She was kicked out for not paying rent
And now all my money?s spent
So tell me

[Chorus]

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh heart don't tell me I'm wrong

Not another Jazzy Belle
Say is it so prey tell
So she got a good game
But playing with love just ain't my thing
And maybe I should settle down
And maybe start thinking ?bout
Giving her my name
ain't it a shame love driving you insane
Not another but I love her
She remind me so much of my mother
That can't be bad no
Cause my fingers hope and lingers
Hoping that I don't have to look no further
Cause I can't stand another heartbreak, no

Calls to say you missed me when we started

Gerald:
Your nails was done, your hair was pressed
I miss the way you used to dress
When I met you
I really do

Kelly:
I gave my best 4 years, my time was wasted

Gerald:
See I shared your fears, and the tears you cried I tasted

Kelly:
Baby, I loved your kids, opened up my home. Yes I did

Gerald:
Paid your mama's bills. Gave you all when
you had nothing.

Chorus
Love you so, can't let go.
Never thought I'd be without you
Can't imagine life without you

Told me that you'd never leave.
But now you say it hurts too much to stay.

Kelly:
Too much to stay

Gerald:
Said it's hard for me
Your lover's stayin with his mom
Tell me was it worth the drama oh baby
See we got our own kids yeah

Kelly:
If there had to be another.
Why go trick'n in the gutter
And drivin our sh.... mmmmmm

Gerald:
See I know he can't put that thang down like I do.

Kelly:
Baby that was the past. You don't roll like you used

Gerald:
Said what's my motivation
Girl I'm better off alone.

Kelly:
Tell me why can't we just walk away.

Gerald and Kelly:
Why are we so torn?

Both:
Never meant to hurt you.

Gerald Levert,"I remember the old saying daddy used to say
He'd say ""Son, watch your back 'cause misery loves company""
I never understood what it meant
'Till this happened

She put you out with no place to go
You call me up, and I came right on over
Said you had a few problems
You knew you were wrong
Wanted to get yourself right
So I let you stay at my home

When I started peepin' you makin' eyes at my boo
Goin' out your way to be all up in her face
Me and her would be in bed doin' what we do
Then I dunno where, she'd ask me things I only told you

1 - Misery loves company
I thought you were a friend to me
But right is right
And wrong is wrong
So pack your bags
Brother, you on your own
(Step on step on step on)
Get to steppin' brotha'
You're on your own
(Step on step on step on)

My man, my man, my brother, my homey yeah
(Step on step on step on)

A lesson learned, but told long ago
Keep enemies close, but friends even closer
(Tell the truth)
See happiness breeds envy
Don't ever say the words
""It'll never, never, never, never happen to me""

Oh 'cause
One day you'll close your eyes
And then to your surprise
You open them and see
Somebody been all up in your cherry tree
Then that'll be the day
That you'll lose your mind
Just spending time writing letters
In a cell doing twenty to life

Repeat 1
Get to movin' homey
Get to goin', boy
You act like you don't know me
Get your move on
Oh no, no, no

It's a low down dirty shame
When your so-called friends start playin' games
They know how to get to you
All inside, all up in your business
Start breakin' up your family too
Your family took him in as one of them
And as time gone by they don't even care
No respect, they moved on 
And here comes jealousy
But they had the same, the same opportunities as you do
So you got to tell him, get to steppin' brother
'Cause you ain't nothing, you ain't no good
You ain't no good, you ain't no friend of mine
Testify now, this evening
Raise your hands this evening
Said you was the one, you was my best friend
You was my best friend
You was my
Brother, friend, homey through thick and thin

time ago. How could I forget the way
I felt, when I first laid eyes on
you. I remember saying to my friends,
there is my future wife; and then, I
took the steps to meet someone who
would change my life.

It had to be my destiny

Chorus:

Cuz, I was made to love ya/my hands
to touch ya/my arms to hold ya/my legs

with you forever our life together.

Verse 2

I remember our first date, our first
argument. Our very first break up to
make up, that got us to this moment.
And every girlfriend and every one
night stand, every heartbreak, every
heartache, led me to ya, it drove me
to ya, made me better, better suited
for ya.

I can feel it, uh

On a day like today
I got out of bed, upped and went my way
Tryin' to find some peace of thing
But here ain't no rest for, oh, every man

Everything seemed to get me down
Looking everywhere just to find a smile
Then the phone rings and an angel sings

And it's funny you should call today
It's been too long, thought you just moved on
And it's funny you should call today

And whenever he won't do you 
The way you want him to
Don't cry (I'll be there no more hurt, no more pain)

And I give the world to see you smile

Now you open up your eyes to see
He's not the one

Now your pain is in the past
Dry your eyes
And all I ask just one more thing
Let me see you smile

When your all alone, smile
Waiting by the phone, smile

I'll be by your side, smile
No more lonely nights, smile, smile for me
Baby won't you smile for me

Verse 1
Everyone needs someone they can talk to
If it's fine with you they would walk through
With no hesitation be there
They care for you
And everyone needs someone they can run to
In the nick of time they are
Sure to come through
Cause they have your best interest at heart
Their part, part of you
Chorus
We all need a soul mate
Someone to hold
When the nights become cold
Someone to love
We all need a soul mate
A shoulder to cry
Just to help us get by
Someone for us
Verse 2
Now who in the right mind
Wouldn't want a love they
Can have for a lifetime
Someone they can cherish
Someone they can share with for life
May one person, no, no, no, no, no
And who wouldn't want someone
They can dream with
Not to mention any more proud then to be seen with
Your lover and your best friend
Times like these we appreciate
Chorus
Got to hear me y'all
You got to hear me now
Soul, soul mate
Got to be with me now
We all need a soul mate
Someone to hold when the nights become cold
Someone to love
Shoulder to cry just to help you get by
Someone for you and me, me and you
Baby, baby, baby. baby, baby, baby
We all need someone to love sometime
Someone to hold on to, listen baby

Someone to hold when the nights become cold
Someone to love when its cold outside
And I need a shoulder to cry
To help me get by

You pulled me close to your face
Whispered this is wrong

Love can be right or wrong
And if I choose the one I’d like to help me through

Sayin’ we can make it, baby
Sayin’ stepping on a gear on my limb
Sayin’ we can make it, baby

Sayin’ I’m stepping on a gear with my heart in my hand
Sayin’ we can make it, baby

Gerald Levert,"No, no, no
How can I express
My apology to you
I know I better pay
For all the things I put you through
Lying 'bout my whereabouts
I don't even take you out no more
So it wasn't a surprise to me
When I found my clothes outside the door

Before you put me out
Girl, please understand
I ain't nuthin' special
I am just a man
Who loves you with all my heart
But I didn't use my head
I swear that I'll be back, girl
So just keep it warm
On my side of the bed
On my side of the bed

I know how I would feel
If you went astray
Thinking 'bout somebody lovin' you
Better than I do, girl
Would make me go insane
Can I have a kiss goodbye
And I'll be on my way
Believe me I'll be on my knees
Beggin' you take me back someday

Before you put me out
Girl, please understand
I ain't nuthin' special
I am just a man
Who loves you with all my heart
But I didn't use my head
I swear that I'll be back, girl
So just keep it warm
On my side of the bed
On my side of the bed

I don't know what I'd do
If I can't spend my time with you
I'll miss calling out your name
It wouldn't be the same
Not waking up and seeing you
To ""show"" beats ""tell"" all day
Girl, I'm gonna find a way
To show you that I changed
And I ain't playing games
I know I gotta leave
But I'll make you believe

Before you put me out
Girl, please understand
I ain't nuthin' special
I am just a man
Who loves you with all my heart
But I didn't use my head
I swear that I'll be back, girl

On my side of the bed
On my side of the bed

It's gon' be always my side
Um my, my, my, my, my side
It's gon' be always my side

But these four walls close in more every day
And I'm dying inside and nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside and nobody knows it but me
Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a-tumblin' down
I can say it so clearly but you're nowhere around
The night are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me
How blue can I get, you could ask my heart
Just like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now, you know, I'll be loving you still
The night are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me

It will see me through like a charm until you return

Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Gerard,"Hals über Kopf verlebt
Ich stürz durch diese Clubs als ob sie mir gehören
Und auch den Rest der Stadt muss ich zurückerobern
Denn du hast sie mir zerstört, alles weggenommen, nichts dagelassen
Was nach Jahren bleibt passt scheinbar in zwei Tragetaschen
Hoffentlich habe ich nicht diesen Donnerstagabend
Bis ich mich sonst wo ablenke in meinen Kopf
Denn ich will endlich mal schlafen
Ich habe hier nichts zu suchen
Doch steh rum als wär das mein eigener Laden
Bis ich wirklich nicht mehr kann
Lass mich via Taxi dann irgendwo parken, steig aus und kotz
Ich will weg von hier, weg von hier und bleibe doch
Die Stadt verschluckt mich mit all ihren Clubhits
Der Puls der Stadt hält mich noch wach denn ich muss mit
Doch kann nicht mehr
Es würde höchstens rund laufen wenn im Kreisen  Kanten wären
Unser Film
Ich will ihn doch nur weiterdrehen
Auf meiner Couch sitzen, deine Geister weigern sich seit Wochen heimzugehen

Ich lauf mit Tunnelblick durch diese Stadt und ich wunder mich
Wieso sieht's hier jetzt so anders aus
Seit sie nicht mehr unsere ist?
Alles grau seit du verschwunden bist
Und ich atme und warte bis es anders wird
Was ist da passiert?
Du warst doch grad noch hier
Doch jetzt ist alles verschwommen
Alles verschwommen, alles verschwommen, alles verschwommen

Ich lasse mich im blauen Nebel fallen, draußen ist es kalt
Will trotzdem raus doch ich hab auch noch nicht bezahlt
Stroboskope blitzen grau, der Rauch wirkt schon normal
Ich will dich noch sehen, hab meinen Auftritt schon geplant
Nummer längst gelöscht, doch wen verarsch ich da?
Sicher in alten SMSen noch wo zu finden und ich hab noch paar, Handy raus
Was für 'ne Scheißidee - lieber schnell Handy aus
Weitertanzen, weitertun als gäbs kein Morgen mehr
Kein Übermorgen mehr, kein Über-Übermorgen mehr
Shots schon x-mal geext zwischen Lückenfüllersätzen
Versucht Brückenstützer zu setzen
Doch du hast sie nicht mal entdeckt, einfach weggesehen
Jetzt bewege ich mich zwischen Mädchen
Die leicht beschämt nach gemeinsamen Nächten gehen
Doch eben das will ich nicht
Nora, ey spitze hingekriegt

Ich lauf mit Tunnelblick durch diese Stadt und ich wunder mich
Wieso sieht's hier jetzt so anders aus
Seit sie nicht mehr unsere ist?

Will ich dann nachts auf die Uhrzeit auf meinem Handy schauen
Kann ich leider nichts erkennen
Diese verdammten kleinen Ziffern
Sind alle verschwommen
Und auch am Tag sehe ich den ganzen anderen Scheiß von dieser Stadt
Leider auch nur verschwommen
Deine Nummer seh' ich auch verschwommen
Auf deine SMS würde ich gern mal was schreiben
Doch ich kann sie leider nicht lesen
Ich seh' sie auch verschwommen
Würd' gern auf Partys mit dir über irgendwas reden
Doch geht nicht, sorry

Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

It's wonderful, so they say
And with the moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say",They Say It's Wonderful

Près d'un lac, je m'étais endormie
Quand soudain, semblant crever le ciel
Et venant de nulle part surgit un aigle noir

Lentement, les ailes déployées
Lentement, je le vis tournoyer
Près de moi dans un bruissement d'ailes
Comme tombé do ciel l'oiseau vin se poser

Il avait des yeux couleur rubis
Et des plumes couleur de la nuit
À son front brillant de mille feux
L'oiseau roi couronné portait un diamant bleu

De son bec, il a touché ma joue
Dans ma main il a glissé son cou
C'est alors que je l'ai reconnu
Surgissant do passé il m'était revenu

Dis l'oiseau, oh dis emmène-moi
Retournons au pays d'autrefois
Comme avant dans mes rêves d'enfant
Pour cueillir en tremblant des étoiles, des étoiles

Comme avant dans mes rêves d'enfant
Comme avant sur un nuage blanc
Comme avant allumer le soleil
Être faiseur de pluie et faire des merveilles

L'aigle noir dans un bruissement d'ailes
Prit son vol pour regagner le ciel,

Quatre plumes couleur de la nuit,
Une larme ou peut-être un rubis
J'avais froid, il ne me restait rien
L'oiseau m'avait laissée seule avec mon chagrin

Gérard Depardieu,"Dans les paniers d'osier de la salle des ventes 
Une gloire déchue des folles années trente 
Avait mis aux enchères, parmi quelques brocantes 
Un vieux bijou donné par quel amour d'antan 

Elle était là, figée, superbe et déchirante 
Ses mains qui se nouaient, se dénouaient tremblantes 
Des mains belles encore, déformées, les doigts nus 
Comme sont nus, parfois, les arbres en Novembre 

Comme tous les matins, dans la salle des ventes 
Bourdonnait une foule, fiévreuse et impatiente 
Ceux qui, pour quelques sous, rachètent pour les vendre 
Les trésors fabuleux d'un passé qui n'est plus 

Dans ce vieux lit cassé, en bois de palissandre 
Que d'ombres enlacées, ont rêvé à s'attendre 
Les choses ont leurs secrets, les choses ont leurs légendes 
Mais les choses nous parlent si nous savons entendre 

Le marteau se leva, dans la salle des ventes 
Une fois, puis deux fois, alors, dans le silence 
Elle cria: ""Je prends, je rachète tout ça 
Ce que vous vendez là, c'est mon passé à moi"" 

C'était trop tard, déjà, dans la salle des ventes 
Le marteau retomba sur sa voix suppliante 
Elle vit s'en aller, parmi quelques brocantes 
Le dernier souvenir de ses amours d'antan 

Près des paniers d'osier, dans la salle des ventes 
Une femme pleurait ses folles années trente 
Et revoyait soudain défiler son passé 
Défiler son passé, défiler son passé 

Car venait de surgir, du fond de sa mémoire 
Du fond de sa mémoire, un visage oublié 
Une image chérie, du fond de sa mémoire 
Son seul amour de femme, son seul amour de femme 

Hagarde, elle sortit de la salle des ventes 
Froissant quelques billets, dedans ses main tremblantes 
Froissant quelques billets, du bout de ses doigts nus 
Quelques billets froissés, pour un passé perdu 

Hagarde, elle sortit de la salle des ventes 
Je la vis s'éloigner, courbée et déchirante 
De ses amours d'antan, rien ne lui restait plus 
Pas même ce souvenir, aujourd'hui disparu",Drouot

Un soir, que je rentrais chez moi
Partout, elle me fait escorte

La garce, que le Diable l'emporte

Dans ta triste robe de moire 
Avec tes cheveux mal peignés
T'as la mine du désespoir
Tu n'es pas belle à regarder
Allez, va t-en porter ailleurs 
Ta triste gueule de l'ennui
Je n'ai pas le goût du malheur
Va t-en voir ailleurs si j'y suis 

Je veux encore rouler des hanches
Je veux me saouler de printemps
Je veux m'en payer, des nuits blanches
A coeur qui bat, à coeur battant
Avant que sonne l'heure blême 
Et jusqu'à mon souffle dernier
Je veux encore dire je t'aime
Et vouloir mourir d'aimer

Elle a dit Ouvre-moi ta porte
Je t'avais suivie pas à pas
Je sais que tes amours sont mortes
Je suis revenue, me voilà
Ils t'ont récité leurs poèmes
Tes beaux messieurs, tes beaux enfants
Tes faux Rimbaud, tes faux Verlaine
Eh ! bien, c'est fini, maintenant

Depuis, elle me fait des nuits blanches
Elle s'est pendue à mon cou
Elle s'est enroulée à mes hanches
Elle se couche à mes genoux
Partout, elle me fait escorte

Gerard Gibbs,"For awhile, to love was all we could do 
We were young and we knew 
In our eyes were alive 
Deep inside we knew our love was true 
For awhile, we paid no mind to the past 
We knew love would last 
Every night, something right 
Would invite us to begin the day 
Something happened along the way 
What used to be happy was sad 
Something happened along the way 
And yesterday was all we had 
And, oh, after the love has gone 
How could you lead me on 
And not let me stay around  
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone 
What used to be right is wrong 
Can love that's lost be found ? 
For awhile, to love each other with all 
We would ever need 
Love was strong for so long 
Never knew that what was 
Wrong, oh, baby, wasn't right 
We tried to find what we had 
Till sadness was all we shared 
We were scared 
This affair would lead our love into 
Something happened along the way 
Yesterday was all we had 
Something happened along the way 
What used to be happy is sad

And, oh, after the love has gone 
How could you lead me on 
And not let me stay around ? 
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone 
What used to be right is wrong 
Can love that's lost be found ?

Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you

I made my bed, that's where I'll lie

Marie quand je t’ai connue tu portais des robes à fleurs
Marie des rubans de couleurs 
Marie tu habitais la vieille ferme auprès du grand pont
Marie tu gardais les moutons
Marie tu portes aujourd’hui des robes en lamé d’argent
Marie tu ne garde pas plus d’une nuit tes amants 

Marie à la messe du dimanche tu apportais des fleurs
Marie tu priais le seigneur
Marie quand tu arrivais au bal sur ton vieux vélo
Marie on sifflait dans ton dos

Marie tu es aujourd’hui plus connue que le Seigneur
Marie c’est toi qui conduis tes autos à cent à l’heure

Dans la nuit sombre et glacée
Quand je marchais à côté de mon frère
Sur le chemin des écoliers
Quand nos membres, encore tout engourdis
De sommeil, grelottaient sous les assauts du vent
Nous nous battions à grands coups de boules de neige
En riant

Nous arrivions dans la salle de classe
Où le maître nous séparait
Nous retrouvions chaque jour notre place
Et l'on ne pouvait plus se parler
Puis bercés par les vagues d'une douce chaleur
Que nous prodiguait le vieux poêle
Nos esprits s'évadaient pour se rejoindre ailleurs
Vers des plages

Où il fait toujours beau, où tous les jours sont chauds
Où l'on passe sa vie à jouer
Sans songer à l'école, en pleine liberté,
Pour rêver

Où il fait toujours beau, où tous les jours sont chauds
Où l'on passe sa vie à jouer
Sans songer à l'école, en pleine liberté,
Pour rêver

Je me souviens de l'odeur fade et chaude
De notre classe calfeutrée
Des premières lueurs pâles de l'aube
A travers les vitres givrées
Je revois les yeux tendres et les visages tristes
Qui autour de moi écoutaient
Et pendant les leçons dans mon coin je rêvais
A des îles

Où il fait toujours beau, où tous les jours sont chauds
Où l'on passe sa vie à jouer
Sans songer à l'école, en pleine liberté,

Elle disait faut pas toucher
Aux oiseaux dans les champs de blé
Je tuerai le chasseur qui les tuera
Je te tuerai même si c'était toi

There will be an answer, let it be

Qu'on se raconte des histoires

Et les mains des vieillards
Qui caressent les enfants

Des troncs des marronniers
Et des kiosques à musique

Elle en a marre de la misère.

Avec son il de verre
Mangé par les vers,
Percé de flèches empoisonnées,

Avec des mouches plein la gueule,
Les semelles collées
Tu sentiras dans ton dos
Glisser les anneaux
Du serpent froid
Ce sera la dernière fois.

Sur la grande rivière,
Le paradis sur la Terre.
T'as l'indienne qui court,
Qui hurle à l'amour,
Aux pierres aux ronces,
Et qu'a pas de réponse,
Et qu'a pas de réponse.

Alors, tu te sens si vieux,

Gerard-René-Gordon,"Don't know why I'm surviving ev'ry lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
My life would end
And it doesn't matter how I cry
My tears of love a waste of time
If I turn away

Can't let go and it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily to you my love
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do

Am I strong enough to see it through?
Go crazy is what I will do
If I can't have you, I don't want no other, baby
If I can't have you, uh huh, ah!
If I can't have you, I don't want no other, baby
If I can't have you, uh huh, ah!

Gerardina Trovato,"Vivo ricopiando yesterday
E sone sempre in mezzo ai guai
Vivo e ti domando cosoa sei
Ma, specchio, tu non parli mai
Io che non potrò mai creare niente
Io amo l'amore ma non la gente
Io, che non sarò mai un Dio

Vivere, nessuno mai ce l'ha insegnato
Vivere, fotocopiandoci il passato
Vivere, anche se non l'ho chiesto io
Di vivere, come una canzone che
Nessuno canterà

Ma se tu vedessi l'uomo
Davanti al tuo portone
Che dorme avvolto in un cartone
Se tu ascoltassi il mondo
Una mattina
Senza il rumore della pioggia
Tu che puoi creare con la tua voce
Tu pensi i pensieri della gente
Poi di Dio c'è solo Dio

Vivere, nessuno mai ce l'ha insegnato
Vivere, non si può vivere senza passato
Vivere è bello anche se non l'hai chiesto mai
Una canzone ci sarà
Sempre qualcuno che la canterà
Qualcuno non mi basta
Vivere cercando ancora il grande amore
Vivere come se mai dovessimo morire
Vivere per poi capire all'improvviso
Che in fondo questo vita tu 
Non l'hai vissuta

Gerardo,"Seguro que han oído que yo soy educado
Soy un caballerito un chico bien portado
Un joven responsible why siempre bien vestido
Yo no se quien ha mentido

I don't drink or smoke ain't into dope
Won't try no coke, ask me how I do it, I cope
My only addiction has to do with the female species
I eat 'em raw like sushi

No me gustan ternos, mi estilo es moderno
Si me enterno, you me enfermo
Mi apariencia es dura, vivo en la locura
No me vengan con ternuras

So please don't judge a book by its cover
There's more to being a latin lover
You got to know how to deal with a woman
That won't let go
The price you pay for being a gigolo

There's not a woman that can handle
A man like me
That's why I juggle two or three
I ain't one to commit, you can omit that bit
You pop the question that's it
Haber uno, dos, tres, cuatro mujeres
Why la situació allí no muere
No es un delito calmo mi apetito
Con un llanto o un grito

So again don't let my lyrics mislead you
I don't love you but I need you
Would you rather have me lie
Take a piece of your pie and say bye
Or be honest and rub your thighs

Well, it's ten o'clock and I'm two hours late
I never said I was a prompt date
But you kept persisting that I meet your parents
Huh, they're going to love my appearance

Ding dong el timbre suena
Tu madre abre, que vieja mas buena
Le digo ¡Hola! Pero no para bola
Que se ha creido vieja chola

Go and serve the food mom
Que tengo ambre
If you don't hurry, me va a dar un calambre
Why usted señor? Why's your chin on the floor?
Sierra la boca por favor

What's this amor, these little huevos?
Esto sí que yo no pruebo

I'm used to good ol' fashioned
Homestyle Spanish cooking
If I try that I'll be puking
Well it's been a pleasure but we got to go

Gerardo,"Excuse me, where have I seen you? 
They tend to ask me 
A humble answer I give them 
As we start to get closer 
But then even more so 
They all persist on rubbing my torso 
I'm Latin but I ain't wrapping in satin 
No, that old disco look just ain't happening 
I'm fresh and new and making my debut 
So let me run this information by you 
Its true we outdo, it has become an issue 
Love em and leave em fast we won't miss you 
Its tradition were well conditioned 
We outlast the competition, so listen 
We don't care too much about kissing 
No, we know just what you've been missing 
Were straight out and blunt 
We don't put up with stunts 
Baby, you know what we want 

We want the funk 
Give up the funk 
We need the funk 
Gotta have that funk 

don't play shy, don't expect long good-byes 
These are some of the rules that we go by 
No demands and forget holding hands 
Please, not around our friends 
We intend to hold on to our image 
Don't try to cross that line of scrimmage 
Don't say you weren't aware, so have yourself prepared 
And beware, this is a one-time love affair 
See, that's as far as it goes, its our motto 
And you thought you won the lotto 
Waiting to claim your prize you go unrecognized 
Huh! how's that for a surprise? 
So save yourself from confusion and sorrow 
Don't even think about tomorrow 
Tonights the night, enjoy! 
Were here to make some noise 
Let me hear that high pitch in your voice 

We want the funk 
Give up the funk 
We need the funk 
Gotta have that funk 

Smoother than James Bond you wake and were gone 
So you wonder what you did wrong 
Huh! don't be blaming yourself, its a must that we vanish 
Here's the scroop straight to you, but in Spanish... 
Oye nena, rubia o morena, mi excusa est en mis venas 
Soy un simple mujeriego no lo niego ni miento 
Soy latino cien por ciento 
As que piensa lo bien si no es conmigo con quien es? 

Responde de una vez 
No te me hagas la importante la dificil o atorrante 
Al cabo tengo mas amantes 
No te prometo nada saldrs por donde entrastes 
Yo no pienso molestarte 
As que no me busques, me sigas, me asustes 
Busca otro que te la ajuste 

Now there it is, laid out plain and simple 
In Spanish but on tempo 
Can't comprehend at all, confused or in a hole? 
What's the matter? No habla espaol? 
If that's the case then no need to worry 
Bust out the dictionary 
You want some inside info 
Wanna know what you're in for 
Look up right under nympho 

We want the funk 
Give up the funk 
We need the funk 
Gotta have that funk",We Want the Funk

Me divorcie de ella en Obregón
En la capital di un bailadon
Me alcoholice como el dios Eolo
También foquie hasta quedar mongolo
Y cuando volví a entrar al planeta
Andaba en Quino y veía sirenas

Tome la calzada de Quinos Mora
Me periqueé, hasta absorbí la bolsa
Brinque la raya y no hubo demora
Fume Kush como locomotora
Bien relajado y también sonriente
Llegue a las vegas, sin ni un pendiente

Misión cumplida le dije al jefe
Me dio seis fajonas de billetes
Arranque rumbo al hotel París
Mujeres, vino y banda en el suite
Pasado me voy para mi rancho
Y en 5 días, vuelvo volando",El  Trokero Lokochón
Gerardo Ortíz,"Reflejos de un hombre golpeado
Ahora yo obedezco las reglas del Mayo
El sexto sentido encendido
Por eso yo miro, pa estar advertido

No mato inocentes
Camino hacia enfrente
Peña, soy el veinte
Practica frecuente, preparo mi gente

Camino a mi pueblo adorado
Mi rancho en Italia pa darme un descanso
Niveles, equipos y rangos, lujos y modales como un siciliano

Mi jefe el Padrino
Con Juancho y Nachito
Guzmán, el chapito
También la familia es parte del equipo

La ultima sombra ahora me han apodado
Pues cuando aparezco los hago pedazos
Mis dedos, mis manos, verlos al matarlos
No conozco bocas que puedan contarlos
Me como sus almas y no soy un mago

Testigos presentes del juicio
Sentencias de muertos aplico
Aborrezco a los enemigos
Aquellos que roban les tengo un castigo
Veinte mandamientos maneja el amigo

Ahora que se puso de moda
Matar por dinero
Faltar el respeto
Aplican en mi restricciones, cambio y reacciones, las corporaciones

Anillos de acero
Cuidar el terreno
Presión al gobierno
Yo soy el teniente, aquí los espero

Siniestro, activo, perfecto
Esos aparatos me hicieron maestro
La sierra, sus mares , mi rancho
Nayarit mi estado pa ser más correcto

Mis hijos, familia
Mi gente, oficinas
Cuentas, mercancías
El señor Zambada se aprecia & se estima

Pero la plebe me trae bien enamorado
Es de la mafia y piensa que estoy asustado
Más con mi gente se va a topar con balazos

Si el tiene gente yo también tengo la mía
Pero al final la muchachita va ser mía
Por que me gusta y lo que quiero lo consigo
Y no me importa lo que piense ese viejillo

Cuando le llevo serenata me ha tronado
No me respeta y eso que ando empecherado
Con una escuadra y me sobran los de abajo
Y si hay problemas aquí traigo mis muchachos
Es que la leve es tan bonita tan hermosa
Y los carteles aquí salieron sobrando

Cuando ay problemas con la pleb me preparo
P que mi suegro casi siempre anda ensillado
Le pongo banda o le mando algún regalo
Una cheyene o cualquier carro del año

No me preocupa que sea del cartel contrario
Por que no tardan en que le llegue novenario
Yo me la robo me la llevo por mi lado
Y sin problemas en un tiempo nos casamos

Ahora le llego con la banda día y noche
Y me recibe no me hace ningún reproche
Soy de la mafia tengo que ser respetado
Y es que la leve quiere seguir a mi lado
Pues que no entienden diferencia y niveles

Gerardo Ortíz,"Si yo soy el abelito
Del que tanto platicaban
Aquel niño inofensivo
Al que nadie respetaba
Ahora ya creció abelito hoy si pesan sus palabras

Botellas martel y banda
Equis so pa la plevada
Una escuadra por el cinto
Por supuesto en dìamantada
Una plebe por un lado
De su gusto la muchacha

De sangre fuerte el muchacho
Tenia que ser Sinaloense
Educado y decidido
Bien ase que lo respeten
La bendición de su madre siempre la tiene presente

Lo mira llegar wamuchil
Al muchacho siempre al tiro
A arreglar unos negocios visitar a los amigos
Nomas sale de las vueltas
Se va pa estados unidos

Estoy bien apoderado
De respaldo esta mi tío
Y si hay algún problema
También cuento con mi primo
Ellos saben el camino y tropiezan muy poquito

Por el frente yo me rajo por que soy bien positivo
Y aunque todo se sacuda aquí voy en el camino
Y aunque viva en california Sinaloa me ve seguido

Gerardo Ortíz,"Dicen que yo no trabajo
Por que me ven descansando
En una troka del año
Es que tengo gente al mando
Que cuida bien esta empresa
No ocupo tanto relajo

De apodo me dicen cuate
Saben que estoy cinco a siete
Y todita mi plebada
En uno están bien pendiente
El M tres mis respetos
Y Culiacán mi presente

Existen muchos problemas
Conflictos del movimiento
Y cuando se me presenta
Yo sólito los arreglo
Ahí tengo una que si truena
Lueguito les entra el miedo

C1 nombre en la clave
El cuarto su buen amigo
En fin anda como piedra
Listo para el enemigo
Nomas le pican la cresta
Saca la 45

Los lujos son en excesos
Para eso trabaja el viejo
Plebitas hay entre el medio
Norteños en sus festejos
El cinco no va de postre
Para aguantar el desvelo

Los radios están sonando
Creo que estamos avanzando
De rivers aya en San Diego
Me la paso circulando
Ya se fueron las muchachas
En Phoenix se andan paseando

Cuando llegaron las balas 
No era advertencia 
Ni coincidencia 
Era la muerte en mi cara 
Tiempo que es vida 
Blanco ala mira 
Asesinato me tenían rodeado 
En mi mente,Mi familia 
En minutos repase mi vida 
Puse fuerza,en mi cabeza 
Subí tiro a mi 40
Les di pelea 

Era esperado 
Que me arrimaran un golpe 
Cuando hay errores 
Hay correcciones 
Y le falle a los señores 
Hice negocios 
Con los contrarios 
Fui un chapulin aunque debas usar 
Consecuencias ,Que atormentan 
Hay errores que nunca se arreglan 
Si la muerte,Comprendiera 
& si el momento cambiara la escena 
Que me coma la tierra 

Con la fuerza paraba las balas 
El impacto dio una alta descarga 
No hubo tiempo de hacer el intento 
Sin piedad perforaban mi cuerpo 
Con mis manos tapaba mis sesos 
& la Sangre corría entre mi cuerpo 
Ya lo rojo en lo blanco vestía,era la 
Despedida,No tenia salida 

Todo era blanco 
Agonizaba en mi llanto 
Solo en minutos 
Se aproximaba 
Era el eterno descanso 
Muerte en la escena 
Luz de sirenas 
Los agresores tomaron vereda 
En segundos Tocaban mi vida 
Y el espacio quedo en mi familia 
Solo Balas y un hombre tirado 
Y en su cara un lienzo empapado 
Era el afectado 

Pobre y sin llanto 
Y cantidad de rosarios 
Buenos amigos 
Hijos queridos 
Ya les falle en el camino 
cuerpo manchado 
Entrajesado

Solo el ruido de afuera y yo
Estoy a un lado desaparezco para ti

No voy a llorar y decir
Que no merezco esto
Por que
Es probable que
Lo merezco, pero no lo quiero por eso me voy

Y que lastima pero adios
Me despido de ti y me voy
Y que lastima pero adios
Me despido de tiii

Por que se que me espera algo mejor
Alguien que sepa darme amor
De ese que endulza la sal
Y hace que salga el sol
Yo que pense que nunca me iria de ti
Que es amor del bueno de toda la vida
Pero hoy hoy entendi que no hay suficiente para los dos

No voy a llorary decir
que no merezco esto
Porque
Es probable que
Lo merezco, pero no lo quiero por eso me voy

Y que lastima pero adios
Me despido de ti y me voy
Y que lastima pero adios
Me despido de ti voy

Que lastima pero adios
Me despido de ti y me voy",Me Voy

Me siento afectado, desidi vengarlo

Gerardo Ortíz,"Yo nomas me la pasaba trabajando
Siempre fui muy caballero
De respeto y apreciado
Tuve amigos y llene mi corazón
De la sangre de mi gente
Y mi familia que tanto amo
No se que es un enemigo
Porque no tuve motivos
Para que me arrebataran el camino
Hay les va la historia de mi primo

En segundos se me revelo mi vida
Por mi mente no pensaba en despedida
De momento no te esperas de una bala
Con honor a sangre fría
Sin pensar ocasionaron el dolor
De un gran espacio en mi familia
Fui muy bueno y aprendí a vivir la vida
Y doy las gracias a la gente que me estima
Esta fue mi despedida

Es difícil quiero recordar mis años
Tuve buenos y momentos apresados
He clavado a mi viejita
Y el amor que siempre tuve a mis hermanos
La pasión por las guitarras
Y el calor que me brindaba un escenario
Los momentos que pasamos trabajando
Junto a temo tantos sueños que logramos
Nunca dejo de extrañarlo

Repasando los momentos en mi vida
Ala mitad de mi tiempo fueron tiempos de alegría
Mi trabajo, mis amigos, mi familia
Y hoy cumplen mi corazón de una mujer tan compresiva
Disfrutaba de mis años muchos rifles regalados
Pues mi error es que fui bueno con los malos
Y es que dios nos hizo como hermanos

Tuve infancia y bien recuerdo los problemas
Y encontrarle la razón solo me quema
El haberle batallado
Y eso me hizo una persona sin barreras
Me paseaba por las calles
Con amigos en mi humilde patineta
Mis recuerdos, los consejos de mi padre
Era niño fue difícil escucharle
El respeto es importante

A mi madre le agradezco sin medida
El momento que dio a luz me dio la vida
Cada voz, cada detalle, cada espacio
Lo recuesto día con día
El amor, una criatura
Sin ningunas condiciones sobran vidas

Increíble los causantes de este daño
Los espero en unos años",Ramiro Caro [Versión Deluxe] [Version]

Pero eso no me iso perder la cabeza
Mejore las armas
Tambien mi estratejia
6 años al frente son mucha potencia

La sabiduria y mucha experiencia
Me dieron el puesto
El color me dio fuerza
Solo por tener sangre azul
En mis venas
Soy de piel morena

Aviles principios se isieron camino
Nunca fue tan facil
Pero nos movimos

Corretio riquzas, crecio como pino
Y al tocar el cielo forjo su destino
Los miro de arriva un angulo perfecto
No tengo pendientes
Morire de viejo

No estudien mi historia yo no soy un cuento
Respeto meresco,
Soy muy recervado y
Nunca fui aislado

Y en otro tiempo en mi pasatiempo la oscilación mi visión

Y es que si el miedo se me atraviesa hago un enlace
Con mi inteligencia
Así me entrego en ese trabajo de corazón soy matón
Miro la situación me manifiesto fuerte para dar acción

Tengo campaña y el gobierno sabe en contra los lujos

A la orden del señor la pausa plaza en la rotación

Gerardo Ortíz,"Cara ala muerte
Cuando llegaron las balas
No era advertencia
Ni coincidencia
Era la muerte en mi cara
Tiempo que es vida
Blanco ala mira
Asesinato me tenían rodeado
En mi mente, mi familia
En minutos repase mi vida
Puse fuerza, en mi cabeza
Subí tiro a mi cuarenta
Les di pelea

Era esperado
Que me arrimaran un golpe
Cuando hay errores
Hay correcciones
Y le falle a los señores
Hice negocios
Con los contrarios
Fui un chapulin aunque debas usar
Consecuencias ,Que atormentan
Hay errores que nunca se arreglan
Si la muerte,Comprendiera
Y si el momento cambiara la escena
Que me coma la tierra

Con la fuerza paraba las balas
El impacto dio una alta descarga
No hubo tiempo de hacer el intento
Sin piedad perforaban mi cuerpo
Con mis manos tapaba mis sesos
Y la Sangre corría entre mi cuerpo
Ya lo rojo en lo blanco vestía, era la
Despedida,No tenia salida

Todo era blanco
Agonizaba en mi llanto
Solo en minutos
Se aproximaba
Era el eterno descanso
Muerte en la escena
Luz de sirenas
Los agresores tomaron vereda
En segundos Tocaban mi vida
Y el espacio quedo en mi familia
Solo Balas y un hombre tirado
Y en su cara un lienzo empapado
Era el afectado

Pobre y sin llanto
Y cantidad de rosarios
Buenos amigos
Hijos queridos
Ya les falle en el camino

Me converti en un cobarde
Y te enrede entre mi cadena de problemas ahi que pena
Mis celos, desprecios se fueron
Agotando

Buenos tiempos, lo siento, cariño que tristes olvido, olvido
Ojala que en tu camino se aparesca
Gente buena

Ojala y que pronto encuentres con quien
Mirar las estrellas
Ojala que mi recuerdo no te
Arruine una sonrisa, que frio
Se siente dificil es perderte
Para siempre que tristes
Olvido lo siento no merezco
Tu cariño olvido

Ojala que en tu camino se aparesca
Gente buena ojala y que pronto
Encuentres con quien mirar las
Estrellas ojala que mi recuerdo no te
Arruine una sonrisa, que frio se siente
Dificil es perderte para siempre que
Tristes olvido lo siento no merezco
Tu cariño olvido",Olvido

Contra el poder del estado
Y desde aquel avil recuerdo del año
77 desde entonces no he parado
Yo trabajo pa mi pueblo
Tengo un gran equipo armado
Mil historias an contado hoy por
Ser primer ministro me mantienen señalado

Y me mantienen señalado pero
No sean preguntado quien ayudara
A este pueblo como yo se eh ayudado
Lo recalco y lo repito y bien queda confirmado
Que seguire trabajando contra el poder del estado
Esta no es una amenaza
Es un echo y lo he logradoo

Soy del rancho de la tuna
Serca de badiraguato y desde
Aque 12 de enero del 2001 recuerdo
Me les pele pa mi rancho
Y de las cosas importantes que hoy
Existen en mi vida, el nivel de mis negocios
Amistades de mis socios, el calor de mi familia
El calor de mi familia de mis hijos adorados
Sin olvidas a mis viejas pues soy muy rnamorado
El golde de la famila como olvidar ami hijo
Siempre lo llebo en mi mente como ivan y alfredito

Que te toque el frío y acaricie con sus manos

Ahora que no estoy no puedes entender
Que no valoraste todo mi querer
Que no me convencen tus dedicaciones
Quieres que regrese con esas canciones
Que te llore el cielo

Que te llore el cielo
Que el entienda tus razones
Que solo el recuerdo te desangre y te traicione
Que te sepa amargo el vivir sin mi
Que ya no soportes sin saber de mi
Solo tu jugaste con mis sentimientos
Yo no soy costumbre de tus pasatiempos
Que te llore el cielo

Te quiero decir que la verdad te extraño
Ahora tu presencia ya no me hace daño
Yo no soy costumbre yo no soy dinero
Vas a recordar lo mucho que te quiero
Y cuando eso pase quiero que por dentro
Sientas que le falta una parte a tu cuerpo
Ese corazón que tienes disfrazado
Porque fue un error haberme enamorado

Que te llore el cielo
Porque yo no puedo y la verdad no quiero
Ya se terminó mi amor
Ya se terminó mi amor
Que te llore el cielo

Que te llore el cielo
Que te empape de emociones
Con agua bendita, él tal vez si te perdone

Tal vez te libere de ese gran demonio
Y quizás te atrape la traición y el odio
Como tu lo hiciste te lo harán un día
Y vas a implorar tener una salida
Que te llore el cielo

Que te llore el cielo
Que él comprenda tus razón
No quiero ni el mas mínimo recuerdo solo borrones
Que tus celos lloren al oír mi nombre
Que por un coraje demuestres el cobre
Solo fue una falsa, fue todo una mentira
Ojalá algún día cures esa herida
Que te llore el cielo

Te quiero decir que la verdad te extraño
Ahora tu presencia ya no me hace daño

Aprovechar el momento
Y para darte unas caricias
Mirarte a la cara respirar tu aliento

Y no creas que soy inhumano
pero quiero ese recuerdo
Y quiero llevarlo grabado como una escena en mi pensamiento

solo vine a despedirme
Y me duele este momento
Y solo tomare mis cosas dejare tu cama no querrás saberlo

Porque no puedo ver tu cara
Y la verdad me esta doliendo
Estoy al borde se mojan mis ojos no querrás saberlo

Costumbres que no ha perdido el compa tito 

(y el respeto es lo primero compa tito) 

Yo veo que uno que otro 
Que saca la vuelta 
No nos quita el sueño 
Porque unos respetan 
Se ríen a la espalda 
Y quema la leña 
Para que ser malo 
Nada bueno dejan 
Y siendo realistas 
Aquí el mundo rueda 
Y por ahí nos vemos 
Cuando de la vuelta 

La leyenda dura 
Pa donde voltees 
Se ha puesto difícil 
Han caído plebes 
Así nos toco 
Estar en este ambiente 
Ya no hay vuelta atrás 
También hay billetes 
Música y amigos 
Cerveza y el vino 
Tampoco nos faltan 
Nunca las mujeres 

Se despide porque va de pasadita 
Pues el negocito nunca lo descuida 
Y tampoco descuidamos a la gente 
Cualquier cosa el neto roca ahí está al frente 
Muy tranquilo y con la cabeza encendida 
Aquí esperamos el regreso del 7",El  Tito

Que va con rumbo al sur
Y quiero que esta noche
Tú me des mi despedida

Muy pronto volveré
Primeramente Dios
Deséame buena suerte
Pedacito de mi vida

Llegando a la estación
Del pueblo a donde voy
Te mando un telegrama
Pa' que sepas mi destino

También la dirección
Y calle donde este
Y así nos escribimos
Aunque sea cada Domingo

Jamás me vayas a olvidar
Así me tarde yo en volver
El día que vuelva por aquí
Si voy por otras tierras
También te llevare

Abrázate de mí
Y bésame otra vez
Para llevar recuerdos
En mi pecho bien grabados

Me marcho más feliz
Llevando tu calor
Y el dulce de tu boca
Saboreando entre mis labios
Jamás me vayas a olvidar
Así me

Miramos con tristeza la silla vacía, 
Vacía que con tu engaño e infamia 
Quedo arruinada tu vida la de ellos y mía, 
A veces me preguntan 
Que donde estarás y el hecho 
De mentirles me llena de espanto 
Les digo que en el cielo que 
De allá los veras que los 
Quisiste mucho que fuiste una 
Santa, les tuve que mentir pa´ 
No hacerlos sufrir y me toco 
Llorar sangre del alma mía, no podía 
Decirles que fuiste capas de 
Abandonar por otro tu hogar y tus 
Hijos. 
A veces me preguntan si estas 
En el cielo y me muerdo los 
Labios al decir que si, por dios que 
Hay momentos que e sentido celos 
Viendo que te quieren mucho mas 
Que a mi, no el mas 
Grandesito que ya entiende 
Tu infamia y baja la vista 
Sin verme de frente nunca entra 
A tu cuerpo ni tu 
Nombre aclama y le gusta 
Ahilarse lejos, lejos de la gente 
Veo a la mas pequeña 
Correr por la casa con su sonrisa infantil 
Y su inocente alegría, luego se detiene 
Te besa y te abrasa aunque solo 
Acaricia la silla vacía. 
Les tuve que mentir pa´no hacerlos

Y derramar el llano
Por un lejano amor

Como un judío errante sin parar
En sombras y sin luz

Caído y sin amor
Vacío ya por dentro y sin calor

Gerd Dudek,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Gerd Dudek,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Gerd Rube,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Geresti,"There's a lady who's sure 
All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows 
If the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
In a tree by the brook 
There's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll. 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.",Stairway to Heaven

You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile

Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

It's a hunger for you
There's a midnight train that keeps on runnin'
Keeps on runnin' through
These empty hours I should be sleeping
Swimming in my dreams
But tonight my mind is dancin'
I'm tearing at the seams

What we had, what we lost
We gave to yesterday
A kiss and a smile, a little while
The heavens blew away

I believe in destiny
One more time for you and me
So let it out and let me in
We can fly, so let's begin
I believe in destiny
Tonight is ours eternally
So give it up and make it true
Set me free 'cause I want you

Gotta keep this moment moving
It's a deja vu
Your memory keeps rolling in
But light keeps spinning through

But though we're both far away
We've never been apart
Time and space, can it race
The love that's in my heart

I believe in destiny
One more time for you and me
So let it out and let me in
We can fly, so let's begin
I believe in destiny
Tonight is ours eternally
So give it up and make it true
Set me free 'cause I want you

Geri Halliwell,"Do you think about me, like I think about you, as these nights grow colder,
do you think about us or the love that was lost looking back as we grow
older.

Would you cry if I die, either way nothing changes, and just remember.

Don't call me baby, baby just because you can,
don't call me lady boy, you aint that kind of man, don't call me sugar
honey, you've never done before, its just to little to late, this baby's out
the door.

Do you wish that you cared,
maybe you were too scared to show me what your feeling,
did you run out of time with me on your mind,
didn't we have no meaning.

Would you bleed, if I leave, either way nothing changes, and just remember.

Geri Halliwell,"Have you ever felt too hot to go to bed
Touched yourself instead and watched your body talk
Just let your body talk
Have you ever felt just too hungry for love
The more you get you find that it's just not enough
But you really can't give it up

All you people out there
Put your hands up in the air
Are you feeling you know what
Or do you really care

If it feels like love
Then give it baby that's a rush
If it feels like pain, pain, pain, pain
It's really just the same
If the mood is rude
Then you got the right attitude
And ya better get down, you don't have to get undressed
Just because if feels like sex

Have you ever had a mind too dirty to read
Kinky freaks why don't you get down on your knees
I'm getting hard to please
Have you ever whipped love and left it to cry
Ask yourself the question
Does the cherry pie leave you satisfied

Turn out the light, so I can feel what your thinking
Do you think we'd get it passed the watershed
Let's take it slow, 'cause you know
I know you know, sex is in your head

Geri Halliwell,"Good evening ladies and gentlemen,
And boys you better listen

Names have been changed to protect the innocent
Just in case it's about you
I guess I'm in a little predicament
What else can this little girl do

There was Peter
He was a cheater
Who couldn't keep his hands to himself

There was Richie
Well he got bitchy
So I left him there on the shelf

So I give up on love
I guess I've had enough
And I don't give a... what can I do
Just when I've found the one
And I think loves begun
It's falling through

So I will dry my eyes
And I'll just fantasize
And I'll get moisture eyes and think of you
I'm lookin for the best
And I'll take nothing less
Baby what about you

A meeting of minds is so hard to find
Is there no such a thing as the one
They say love is blind 'cause the truth is unkind
I'm just a hot-loaded gun

There was Henry
Now he got friendly
While dancing in my pink underwear

And there was David
When he got naked
He didn't have much up, or downstairs

So I give up on love
I guess I've had enough
I don't give a, what can I do
Just when I've found the one
And I think loves begun
It's falling through

So I will dry my eyes
And I'll just fantasize
And I'll get moisture eyes and think of you
I'm lookin for the best
And I'll take nothing less
'Cause baby what about you

I said baby, what about, you",So I Give Up on Love
Geri Halliwell,"A little bit of something on a bad-ass day 
Can help me please my my mind 
'Cause a big bit of nothing don't take blues away 
It's just like killing time 

I just wanna rock your celebrity 
A little bit of jammin' live on on Saturday night 
That's my ecstacy 

Oh baby, I want your hot action 
Oh baby, I love who you are 
Oh baby, I want some reaction 
Come on shine on, be my superstar

(Come on baby, come on baby, come on baby be my superstar) 

Gotta go and get me some v.i.p. 
To road is long and high 
We're running through a red, I'm playin with fire 
I won't get out alive 

Trash your room and smash a big tv 
Feeling kinda flashy, do you wanna play God 
Let's play celebrity

Oh baby, I want your hot action 
Oh baby, I love who you are 
Oh baby, I want some reaction 
Come on shine on, be my superstar

So bright it burns my eyes
I need commercial waves
My soul is gonna fly

A little bit of you, just lick me up
You really blew my mind
'Cause baby, you make my shine

Oh baby, I want your hot action 
Oh baby, I love who you are

Geri Halliwell,"Baby, I can feel your thunder
Butterflies on your shoulder
Don't cry, I'll show you what love is
Sideways and under

Twist it just a little more
'Cause baby we are heading for paradise
Soak it up and move it all
Tell me are you ready
Keep the beat rock steady
Baby set your heart on the vine

Surrender your groove
Surrender your heart
Surrender the super love that you've got
I'm making it better
I'm keeping it pure, I guess
My karma's off the hook

You light me up like a firefly
I'm dancing out on the high wire
Sweet thing drink me like a fine wine
We're star-crossed and so sublime

Twist it just a little more

I'm taking you bad

Breathing in time with you, for life

Surrender your heart
Surrender the super love that you've got
I'm making it better

Geri Halliwell,"Sometimes I feel so blue inside
So when I'm lonely
I drive to St. Tropez

I leave the world behind that's gray
Into sunshine
I know I'll be okay I say

Life is short
Too beautiful for you to worry
Don't give up
When love is unkind
There's always tomorrow

Don't let them bring you that down that way
The view is golden
Believe the old clichÂ©

I need a little time to play
So kiss the moonlight
The night is young at heart they say

La vie est courte (life is short)
Too beautiful for you to worry
Tellement courte (so short)
When love is unkind
There's always tomorrow

Just let your imagination take a chance
It'll get you far
Step by step, the road is long
But at the end you can touch a star
I don't care where I came from
It's where I'm going that gets me through
It's all I need to get me through

There's always tomorrow
(Quelque fois je suis triste)
(Sometimes, I'm sad)
There's always tomorrow
(Il why a toujours demain, Il why a toujours de l'amour)

Geri King,"Do you dream of me
Do you think of me
Am I your fantasy

A gentle seduction you touched me with you 
Your essence overwhelms me and I lose control
I float on a sea of extacy your body has given to me
A romantic moment passes into a night of silent passion

Do you dream of me

Am I your fantasy
Do you dream of me
Do you think of me
Am I your fantasy

Thinking about the night I spent locked in your embrace 
Did I please you completely in each and every way
As you sleep are you thinking of the night before or nights to come
Am I your fantasy or am I only your reality

Do you think of me

I long to be your fantasy 
Everything you've ever wantd I will gladly be
Tonight and every night I'll leave you wanting me 
Needing my tounge, needing my hips, needing my lips

I’m looking right at you, but you don’t see me
Checking you, your style, you smile, hey- you got what I want
All my girls are looking, they’re checking you too

When we both just want to be strong

All I have inside out
Who’s to say you win, who’s to say you lose
If we both don’t have no rule
We try to ignore the game, but that’s a game for fools

There are so many things that I should not say, that hurt your heart
Just a little respect, that’s all I ask, no more

I’m only human
We’re both just human being
Love always changes, it never stays
My heart just hurts when you’re not with me

Sometimes I win, all the time I lose
‘Cause we both hurt each others heart
Sayin’ triflin’ things that we really don’t mean, just to see my baby fall
If this is love, it isn’t fair
To you, me, or no one else
I don’t want to fight with the one love of my life

There are so many things that I should not say, that hurt your heart

I just want time to make things right
You never told me what was going on
All this time I thought you were wrong
Now I see that love’s not fair
I didn’t know that you still cared
It’s all the little things you do that has me in love with you
I didn’t mean to say those things
So much I didn’t really mean
I never mean to break your heart
Without you my life’s torn apart
All that I want from you is to tell me why
You say all I do is make you cry
I never mean to hurt you this way

How in the world did it happen though I must have known it coming deep inside of me
Yes I've seen it before but the memory got lost as time sank it with its hands
Like a wave on the shore its lace caresses my feet and sinks them in the sands

Could it be me for you

Its been such a long time since I stood in the wind and the rain
This is what my heart feared 
What happened as I checked you out and you kissed me hello
Now its all come back to me how sweet the dream and the torture of yearning can be

Where no one wants to show their face
The more beautiful the masks the deeper the lies

But you can see their soulless eyes
And that is where their secrets hide
So I need to get out of this place
Cause I don’t want to live in their masquerade, because

Its all a masquerade
A two faced parade
It’s all a masquerade
A charlatan soiree

It’s all a masquerade

And all the games they play 
It’s all a masquerade

Lured into the lovely web they weaved
Entangled in their deceit
So blinded by the pageantry
I was swept away with the false gallantry
All caught up in the fantasy
I can’t blame anyone else but me

No se vivir si tú no estás
Cada rumor que llega a mi
Me hace soñar que estás aquí
Siento tu cuerpo junto a mí
Y al despertar tú ya no estás.

Murió la flor y en mí,
Tu esencia se quedó
Y tu risa infantil
Creo escuchar
Las noches frías son
No brilla más el sol
Desde que tú no estás
Llorando estoy.

Donde estarás?
En que otros labios
Mis caricias dejarás
Mientras que aquí
Cada recuerdo
Es un martirio para mí.

Quite as often as I could have

Away over yonder

Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt

And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gerry Mulligan,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Steals across the meadows of my heart

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

And each kiss an inspiration

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

You make me smile with my heart, 
Your looks are laughable, un-photo-graphical,

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

What a shame that it's gone
All too soon

That only you in love could bring

The bottom fell from everything

Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

That's the old stream that I long to cross 
Old Man River, that Old Man River 
He must know something, but he don't say nothing 
He just keeps rolling, he keeps on rolling along 
He don't plant taters, and he don't plant cotton 
And them what plants 'em is soon forgotten 
But Old Man River, jest keeps rolling along 
You and me, we sweat and strain 
Bodies all aching and wracked with pain 
Tote that barge and lift that bale 
You get a little drunk and you land in jail 
I get weary and so sick of trying 
I'm tired of living, but I'm feared of dying 
And Old Man River, he just keeps rolling along",Varsity Drag
Gerry Mulligan,"Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely
Heaven must have sent him my way

Skies above me
Never were as blue as his eyes
And he loves me
Who would want a sweeter surprise?

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

Gerry Mulligan,"I don't believe in frettin' and grievin'
Why mess around with strife?
I never was cut out to step and strut out.
Give me the simple life.

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant.
Those things roll off my knife;
Just serve me tomatoes; and mashed potatoes;
Give me the simple life.

A cottage small is all I'm after,
Not one that's spacious and wide.
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside.

Some like the high road, I like the low road,
Free from the care and strife.
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeed-y;
Give me the simple life.",Give Me the Simple Life
Gerry Mulligan,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?

Let there be me. 
Let there be oysters 
Under the sea.

Let there be wind, 
An occasional rain. 
Chile con carne, 
Sparkling champagne 

Let there be birds 
To sing in the trees, 
Someone to bless me 
Whenever I sneeze. 

Let there be cuckoos, 
A lark and a dove, 
But first of all, please  
Let there be love.

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You

You don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heart aches for me
But from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you
I hear your voice and I must come to you
I have no choice what else can I do?

The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All the sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain

If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you
So though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Will never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain",Crying in the Rain

Trying to make the people understand, he stops and sighs and says

""Half a chance
Give the singers half a chance and they'll sing and dance through the night
Lend an ear, please
And the band will play the things you'll want to hear

But first of all, a sweet little lady who'd have us all screamin' for more

Down and down
Went her long black stockings and, as they hit the ground, the boys went mad
Everyone agreed
That it was the greatest time they'd ever had
On and on
Now the night was nearly over except for Billy and his big banjo
Billy sang a song called ‘The Truckdriver Man'
And we joined in for a chorus or two and then I went to bed.

And find that she's left without warning

It's a brand new day, let's walk outside and let that breeze blow all our cares away.

You know that way back there in that city life
We've been strangers for so long
Now that I feel like I know you again
I want to stay.

So long ago (yeah), we had a love so warm and bright when we had just begun
That was my last dream, since then I've watched the rest crumble one by one.

Since we've been runnin' silent yeah it's felt so right
It's gettin' closer now everyday
Now that I feel like I know you again

It's like an old mandolin man, you just wind him up and he'll start to sing.

I've been away for quite a while, and I want to hear all your news
Speak to me, let me see you smile, cause I've had those homesick blues
When I go down to that city I just don't know wrong from right
When I go back to you Mattie, well you make me see the light.

Forgot about everything and eased my mind

Sun and rain, sun and the rain

When we threw away our sabers and we joined with Preston's Raiders for a while
We looted and we plundered while the Yankee cannons thundered, we just smiled

Gerry Rafferty,"I live under the coconut tree
I lie in the sun and I swim in the sea
I make my bed below the sky
I still watch the world just a passin' me by.

Hey hey, it's good to be free
'Cause they'll never ever find me 'neath the coconut tree.

I left home because of my nagging wife
Man oh man it was a terrible life
She took all my money and she left me with none
So I packed my bags and decided to run.

My wife and family are looking for me
But they'll never ever find me 'neath the coconut tree.

Hey hey, it's good to be free

Gerry Rafferty,"The coat she wore still lies upon the bed
The book I gave her that she never read
She left without a single word to say
Her father didn't like me anyway.

She always wanted more than I could give
She wasn't happy with the way we lived
I didn't feel like asking her to stay
Her father didn't like me anyway.

Daddy never knew just what she'd seen in me
Daddy didn't like my hair
Perhaps if we had talked, he'd have seen something in me
But Daddy didn't really care.

To tell the truth I didn't have the nerve
I know I only got what I deserved
So now she's taken leave of me today

I wish that you were near me
Gets so bad at times I talk to myself
I wish that you could hear me.

I get to thinking how it all started out, and I know, oh I know
It may not last forever
But in the meantime when the goin' is good, I know, oh I know
That we should be together.

You gave me everything and then some more
When I was cold you opened up the door
Don't want to stop I couldn't anyhow
You know I'm in too deep and I can't stop now.

When I come home I know I don't ever have much to say
I'm just glad to be there
You ask about the people I've met and the places I've been
You ask me what I see there.

I see you, I see you everywhere I go
I see you all around me
On a ship, on a train, on a plane, no matter where I am
I feel your love surround me.

Gerry Rafferty,"I walk along the street and wonder what to do
I'd like to ease the pain in my troubled brain 
But as to how, I haven't a clue
Should I shout at the people who pass me by
Hey folks look at me, I'm no ordinary guy
I had a love and she swore she was mine
But she only loved me when the weather was fine.

My mind tells me what to do
Keep it to yourself, tell nobody else
Just how you loved her so, they don't want to know
Keep it to yourself.

On a subway train, I hide from the rain
And take a seat right next to the door
There's a man with a case and as I look at his face
I'm sure I've seen him someplace before
He looks up and I look down
And then we both look away
The train slows down and my head spins ‘round
It's like scene from a one-act play.

My mind tells me what to do
Keep it to yourself, tell nobody else
Just how you loved her so, they don't want to know
Keep it to yourself.

I feel much better when the sun has lost its glow
When the light of day is fading away
And there are shadows wherever I go
Yes the light is fading and I'm masquerading
As a poet with something to say
The inspiration's gone and I can't turn it on
It's been the same since she went away.

My mind tells me what to do
Keep it to yourself, tell nobody else
Just how you loved her so, they don't want to know
Keep it to yourself.

Gerry Rafferty,"Look over the hill and far away
We'll see the start of a brand new day
Heaven help us when it arrives
One more day with tears in our eyes
For the only one, lonely one
Lonely one, where can she be?

The figure stands at the windowpane
Up to the hill he looks again
Thinking back, he knows he was wrong
How could he leave his home for so long
And he's back to find no change of mind
He was blind, where can she be?

Why does he stand just outside the door
It does no good, he's stood there before
And just waved his hand, I don't understand
There's no one there, so who can explain?

Look over the hill and far away
We'll see the start of a brand new day
Heaven help us when it arrives
One more day with tears in our eyes
For the only one, lonely one
Lonely one, where can she be?

Let your voice ring loud and clear so you'll be heard

For tomorrow you will seek the sun.

Let your voice ring loud and clear so you'll be heard
Just for the moment I'm asking you to stay
For tomorrow you'll be far away
For tomorrow you'll be far away.

Sing your song once more, my singing bird
Let your voice ring loud and clear so you'll be heard

Than an Irish man who worked an honest day
From Steamboat Row, in rain or shine, he'd make his way down to the mine
Along the dusty road he'd travel
Fifteen miles to get there, fifteen miles to go
Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

He used to tell about the time he got hurt down in the mine
He said he'd never go back down again
But in his heart he knew he would, he did the only thing he could
Kept on walkin' down that road
Fifteen miles to get there, fifteen miles to go
Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

That his days were quickly coming to an end

Looking at you sweet darlin', I know I want to stay

What can I do, sweet darlin'?
In the light of the day I was rolling home
I was thinking of you waiting on your own
And I wanted to call but then something said 'Oh no'.

Yeah but now it's a dream, it's a memory
But I'll never forget what you gave to me
I was lost and alone but you made feel ok.
What can I do, sweet darlin', I don't want to go away

Looking at you sweet darlin', I know I want to stay
What can I do, sweet darlin'?
I remember the sound of the passing train
As it rolled through the night in the pouring rain

I'm lookin' for sweet inspiration, every morning noon and night
But these days it just keeps on passing me by,

I know you don't feel like making this journey, but you know that time is on my side

Way down south where the living is easy, we can look across the great divide
But all we've got is a pocketful of memories.

Wish I could change my whole life, and just fly away

My days were filled with music, and my nights with conversation
I didn't worry, didn't care which way the wind was blowin'
Yes there was magic in the air, and music kept on flowin'.
I was a superman ridin' on a river
She always wanted so much more than I could give her

At times I thought I'd go insane
And every night I lay awake until the dawn.
Yes I was lost, I was confused
But he's the one who's being used
Yeah does he know, does he really know
What he's taken on?
Now he might think he's got your love
And that it came from God above
Threw you a line -- he sowed the seeds
He sees your beauty but I know your needs.
He believes that you're sincere
When you say love ain't living here
Yeah does he know -- does he really know
What he's taken on?
Now he might think he's got your love
And that it came from God above
Is he so blind that he can't see
You''ll leave him like you left me.
You sailed away all by yourself
And I was left here on the shelf
I never thought I'd say these words
But I'm glad you're gone.
Yeah he's found truth -- certainty
Resolution, veracity
But does he know -- does he really know
What he's taken on?
Well does he know? Well does he know?
Well does he know? Well does he know?
No no no no no!",Does He Know What He's Taken On
Gerry Rafferty,"Ev'ry night's a lonely night since you went away
But you come back to haunt my memory
I lie awake and think of you and how it used to be
Oh my love don't give up on me.
The symbol of the moon above and living without you
I can't stand this cold reality
You alone can make me whole, our love was meant to be
Oh my love don't give up on me.
In the dying embers of the midnight hour
All these things brought me misery
In the dying embers of the midnight hour
Oh my love don't give up on me.
When you left I know I lost the better part of me
But I can't blame my troubled history
You and I were innocent, our love was meant to be
Oh my love don't give up on me.
In the dying embers of the midnight hour
All these things brought me misery
In the dying embers of the midnight hour
Oh my love don't give up on me.
Jesus came into this world so all men may be found
In the soul of all humanity
Ev'ry time I stumble on the road to Calvary
Oh my love don't give up on me.
In the dying embers of the midnight hour
All these things brought me misery
In the dying embers of the midnight hour
Oh my love don't give up on me
Oh my love don't give up on me
My sweet Lord don't give up on me.
(fade)
Oh my love don't give up on me",Don't Give Up on Me
Gerry Rafferty,"Don't speak of my heart, it hurts too much -- hurts to touch
I'm writing the book each and every day
Take a look at my face, I still need -- I still bleed
I've been running on empty since you went away.

The spirit world looks down on us
Sad that we're apart
So please don't speak of my heart.

Whenever we talk she says hang on -- just hang on
Meanwhile I'm drowning in the pouring rain
And each time we meet there's a sad farewell -- sad farewell
She tells me someday I'm gonna love again.

The way that she walked out on me
Still tears me apart
So please don't speak of my heart.

Every day's an endless maze of dreams that fade and die
No one believed we were saying 'Goodbye'
And every night I think of you I'm still left wondering why
I can't believe that we're saying goodbye.

And when I wake up in the morning
And wonder where I'm going to
It all came without a warning
What's a man supposed to do?

Don't let your heart break down
Don't let your heart break down.

Don't speak of my heart, it hurts too much -- it hurts to touch
I'm writing the book each and every day
Take a look at my face, I still need -- I still bleed
I've been running on empty since you went away.

The spirit world looks down on us,
Sad that we're apart
Don't wanna talk about it -- don't make me think about it
So please don't speak of my heart.

When this old road gets rough
What happens to me and you
What do we do -- we hang on.
When you confess
Your life is in a mess
And only you can muddle through
What do you do -- you hang on.
Love is blind, love is kind
What do you do when it leaves you behind
Like yesterday's papers -- like yesterday's news.
You don't want to be all by yourself
You don't want to be left on the shelf
When you're feeling small and tired of it all.
Those lonely days
Those sad and lonely days
Left sad and blue without a clue
What do you do -- you hang on.
Love is real -- love can heal
What do you do when the love that you feel
Turns out to be one dream that never came true.
You imagined it was so much more
Now you're stranded on another shore
And you don't expect to resurrect.

The feelingâ€™s so strong yeah -- but I could be wrong
A love affair ends, and now weâ€™re just friends
The real thing is gone yeah -- but I could be wrong.
In the morning when I wake up and itâ€™s a sunny day
All my troubles seem to fly away
Then I remember, and itâ€™s down and down I go.
I watch the rising of the moon
Darkness always comes too soon
When the night comes falling
Itâ€™s down and down I go.
Now I can see you donâ€™t need me
Youâ€™ll get along yeah -- but I could be wrong.
Day and night Iâ€™ve been soul searchinâ€™ in a stormy sea
All your tears washinâ€™ over me
When the truth comes callinâ€™, itâ€™s down and down I go.
I was dreaminâ€™ of the night we met
So many moments that I canâ€™t forget
When the night comes fallinâ€™, itâ€™s down and down I go.
Now it appears Iâ€™ve cried all my tears
The sadness is gone yeah -- but I could be wrong
Nothing is touched, I still want you so much

Time goes by and a love affair ends
Hearts run dry and now weâ€™re just friends
The real thing is gone, weâ€™ll sing you a song

",I Could Be Wrong
Gerry Rafferty,"Back in my school days acting the fool boys
One and one and one made three
And the man said come and cut yourself a piece of the big time.
Armour-clad forces riding trojan horses
Never made sense to me
I didnâ€™t wanna be a part of the great debate on moonshine.
â€˜Stop, pay the priceâ€™, they said to me, â€˜take this advice:
Youâ€™re out of your headâ€™
Stop, hold the â€˜phone -- this has to be cut to the bone
Too bad -- I see red
I see red. I see red.
She slips and stumbles, twists and she tumbles
She always lands on her feet
And she keeps her face turned to the far horizon.
Wonâ€™t you come this way -- wonâ€™t you go my way
Her rhythm doesnâ€™t miss a beat
Sheâ€™s just doinâ€™ everything she can to keep surviving.
â€˜Stop, pay the priceâ€™, she said to me, â€˜take this advice:
Youâ€™re out of your headâ€™
Stop, hold the â€˜phone -- this has to be cut to the bone
Too bad -- I see red.
I see red. I see red. Yeah.
Now who wants a riot -- people should be quiet
Donâ€™t we give â€˜em good TV
You can learn to love a lifetime of distraction.
Youâ€™ve got nothinâ€™ on the inside, nothinâ€™ on the outside
All the way from A to B
I can live without that kind of satisfaction.
â€˜Stop, pay the priceâ€™, she said to me, â€˜take this advice:
Youâ€™re out of your headâ€™
Stop, hold the â€˜phone -- this has to be cut to the bone

",I See Red
Gerry Rafferty,"I love you so much, but you're leaving today
Somehow we've lost touch -- I can't make you stay
You say I'll get by, but it's my head on the block
It's easy to talk -- so easy to talk.

What did I do wrong, tell me what was my crime
I've loved you so long, now my neck's on the line
You pass judgement on me while I stand in the dock
It's easy to talk -- so easy to talk.

When we were living in the city of a million dreams
You were telling me that love is never what it seems
Yeah, you walked into my life and now I must surrender.

So you go with him and say I'm to blame
I know I can't win while you feel no shame
For every vow that you break and every word that you mock
It's easy to talk -- so easy to talk.

When we were living in the city of a million dreams
You were telling me that love is never what it seems
Yeah, you walked into my life and now I must surrender.

God holds out His hand, why suffer the gloom
Of a renegade heart in some lonely room
Our lives slip away with each tick of the clock
It's easy to talk -- so easy to talk.

",It's Easy to Talk
Gerry Rafferty,"You get a thunderbolt from out of the blue
And it changes everything about the life you knew
Yes the storm breaks and your heart aches
And then life goes on
When a long time love just disappears
You need someone new to help you through those impatient years
And those sad days, all those mad days
While your life goes on

You know it's over but you can't let go
It's not easy when it comes to saying all those last goodbyes
In that moment when your dreams lie scattered in the dust
You find something you can trust
Love comes to meet you like a brand new day
Love comes to you all along the way
You're walking down the street but you're lost in space
And the future comes to meet you and you like its face

From a blue note comes a new note
And your life goes on
You don't need miracles to point the way
When you know that love is still the reason to believe
In that moment when you know you might have given up
Someone fills your lovin' cup
And lies beside you 'til the break of day
Love comes to you all along the way

A million stars shine in the darkest night
From across the universe there comes eternal light
From this blue world to a new world
Somewhere life goes on
Life goes on
Life goes on",Life Goes On
Gerry Rafferty,"Love comes with a new expression
And the sentimental moon shines in our eyes
Love grows with each new impression
Like an elemental tune that never dies.

But all too soon arrives the dawning
And I awaken to the light of love
The kind of love I want to share with you everyday
We make a promise on this night of love
Let's say a prayer that it might all come true.

Love comes like a revelation
And it changes everything that we can see
Love comes with new inspiration
And it show us everything that we can be.

But all too soon arrives the dawning
And I awaken to the light of love
The kind of love I want to share with you everyday
We make a promise on this night of love
Let's say a prayer that it might all come true.

How many times have you been lost
And even now you count the cost
Of saying all those last goodbyes
Something's come alive on this new morning
You're looking at one more day.

Love comes with a new expression
And the sentimental moon shines in our eyes
Love grows with each new impression
Like an elemental tune that never dies.

But all too soon arrives the dawning
And I awaken to the light of love
The kind of love I want to share with you everyday
We'll make a promise on this night of love
Let's say a prayer that it might all come true ... everyday.

",The Light of Love
Gerry Rafferty,"So long ago when our love was new
And the dreams that lovers dream still cast a spell
When we made love we were together more than we knew
And we gazed down deep into the wishing well.
Every day was a sunny day
Rain seems constant now
I can remember times when your love and affection
Turned my world around.
We separate like rain in a storm
And the wind blows all our words of love away
When we first met you were so loving, you were so warm
Now we meet like strangers on a lost highway.
Our love story was meant to be
All those days gone down
I can remember times when your love and affection
Turned my world around.
In deep blue, old and new
Distant voices call to you
Alchemy, mercury
Now you're free, and you can be who you want to be
I know that you will grow now we're apart
Talk to me when you're all at sea
I will keep songs for you here in my heart.
So long ago when our love was new
And the dreams that lovers dream still cast a spell
When we made love we were together more than we knew
And we gazed down deep into the wishing well.
Every day was a sunny day
Rain seems constant now
I can remember times when your love and affection
Turned my world around.",Love and Affection
Gerry Rafferty,"One night, you'll stand again in the spotlight
And everything will be alright
And you'll wake up from this dark night of the soul.

You started out in rock ‘n' roll
You had music deep in your soul
Now you don't cut it like you used to do
Looks like time has caught up on you.

You've given up, you've settled down
No more riding on the money-go-round
A quiet life and a room with a view
Looks like time's caught up on you.

Holes in your pockets, holes in your shoes
Holes in your day dreams that never came true
So many years but so little to show
Nobody told you -- you reap what you sow.

The way you talk -- makes me sad
I still remember all the good times we had
Right now you're twisted and bitter and blue
Looks like time's caught up on you.

How many times did I hear you say
Forget tomorrow -- just live for today
You've burned some bridges, yeah -- that much is true
Looks like time's caught up on you.

You've got some demons still driving you on
They wonder where all the good times have gone
Nobody calls you, now nobody dares
Nobody wants to ‘cos nobody cares.

Another night, another place
Another limbo where you've fallen from grace
No, you don't cut it like you used to do
Looks like time's caught up on you.

It's caught up on you
It's caught up on you
It's caught up on you
It's caught up on you

One night -- you'll stand again in the spotlight
And everything will be all right
And you'll wake up from this dark night of the soul.

One night -- you'll spread your wings and you'll take flight
And everything will be all right
And you'll wake up from this dark night of the soul.

One night -- you'll stand again in the spotlight
And everything will be all right
And you'll wake up from this dark night of the soul.

Going down a different road, a new direction
Now I've got a new feel, now I've got a new deal
I'm telling everyone I know that I've found something new.

One destiny.

Take your seat, all you need is your rosary beads in your hand,
Time to start, cross your heart, be a part of the mystical band.

[Chorus]
Look at everybody trying to find their own place,
Looking for a heaven up high,
Working just to get into a state of grace,
We know we're gonna need it when we die.

Say your prayers, feel your fears, shed your tears, you're afraid of hell's fire,
As you sit there and pray you'll get carried away by the choir.
And the incense is sweet, takes you right off your feet, makes you higher.

Gerry Rafferty,"I was caught up in a fever 
In that summer of '69
And my heart was cryin' out for change
And I knew time was comin' when I'd get away.
So I moved down to that city
Where I met a friend of mine
And I must admit he tried to warn me well
With all those bad luck stories he could tell.
He said ""Take the money and run,
Take the money and run
Believe it, in this town you can't trust anyone
You're gonna learn that lesson my son"".
""Take the money and run,
Buy yourself a place in the sun
Don't be a fool, don't you trust anyone
You gotta take the money and run, take the money and run"".
He was broken, he was wasted
He'd been brought down to his knee
And his heart was crying out for truth
You could see the whole world's sadness in his eyes.
So I took good care of business
At least as far as I could see
I could read the signs and I knew all the lines
But so many times his voice came back to me.
""Take the money and run,
Get it at the point of a gun
Believe it, in this town you can't trust anyone
You're gonna learn that lesson my son"".
""Take the money and run,
Buy yourself a place in the sun
Don't be a fool, don't you trust anyone
You gotta take the money and run, take the money and run"".
I've been wanderin' through this wasteland
Where the blind go leading the blind
And the only sound on the money-go-round
Was the million voices waiting to be found.
I could only hear a whisper
It was comin' from the one I loved
And her heart was saying this can't be right
All my wasted days and all her lonely nights.
Take the money and run,
Get it at the point of a gun
Believe it, n this town you can't trust anyone
You're gonna learn that lesson my son.
Take the money and run,
Buy yourself a place in the sun
Don't be a fool, don't you trust anyone
You gotta take the money and run, take the money and run.",Take the Money and Run
Gerry Rafferty,"You get so tired of chasing dreams; you think that nothing's true
You start to question everything, everything you do
Feeling scared but you don't know why, so you tell yourself you're doing all right
You're sick of all the empty days that make you so afraid of the night

And if you try to read a book and get between the lines
It doesn't matter where you look; you're only wasting time
When you meet somebody else, and you try to think of something to say
Even while you stand there talking you know your mind is drifting away

You get so tired of chasing dreams; you think that nothing's true
You start to question everything, everything you do
Feeling scared but you don't know why, so you tell yourself you're doing all right
You're sick of all the empty days that make you so afraid of the night",Who Cares?
Gerry Rafferty,"Now the night train is waitin' to take me away
And I'm still feelin' guilty cause you're wanting me to stay
Well I know, how I know, it's harder on you
But you said it yourself, there's nothing else we could do.
When the wheels start turnin', takin' me through the night
Out there in the darkness, there's a star shinin' bright
And it makes me feel better just to see it up there
I hope you're thinkin' about it, hope you know I still care.
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home.
Now I know you've been waiting, but I'll be seeing you soon
Meanwhile I just lay here staring at the moon
And a light made of silver, through my window it creeps
And the train keeps on rollin', and it just rocks me to sleep.
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home.

Goodnight train is gonna carry me home.
Now from city to city, it's four hundred miles
And I'm bound to wake up every once in a while
And it's then that I call out to some higher power
And then I'll go back to sleep cause I'll be home in an hour.

He said ""there's so much of this life of mine that I don't understand""
You shouldn't worry I said that ain't no crime
Cause if you get it wrong you'll get it right next time, next time. 

You need direction, yeah you need a name
When you're standing in the crossroads every highway looks the same
After a while you can recognize the signs
So if you get it wrong you'll get it right next time, next time.

Life is a liar yeah life is a cheat
It'll lead you on and pull the ground from underneath your feet
No use complainin', don't you worry, don't you whine
Cause if you get it wrong you'll get it right next time, next time.

You gotta grow, you gotta learn by your mistakes
You gotta die a little everyday just to try to stay awake
When you believe there's no mountain you can climb
And if you get it wrong you'll get it right next time, next time.

She's got the diamonds, she's even got the suntan
But she's a bright girl, she's got a law degree

When she was young she read the Gurdjieff books
The wisdom blew her away
She's got the money, got good looks
But the girl's got no confidence
No the girl girl girl sweet girl
The girl's got no confidence.

She went to Berkley, did primal therapy
She wrote the music for a series on the TV
She studied Rumi and Ibn'Arabi
She meditated every summer in a teepee.

But no religion's gonna tie her down
She loves her beautiful clothes
She's sittin' pretty livin' way up town
But the girl, the girl's got no confidence
No the girl girl girl sweet girl
The girl's got no confidence.

Little by little she got heavy round the middle
She wore a silk kimono when the sun went down
She wrote to her mother and she took another lover
She gets a little lonely when the sun goes down.

She's got the diamonds, she's even got the suntan

Midsummer magic when the night turns to day
And songbirds greet the dawn
You lie awake
You watch and wonder while the moon fades away
And one more day is born.
Tides keep on turning, while hearts keep on yearning
To be where they know they belong
All on a new day, you see in a new way
The things you've been leaning upon.
Moonlight and gold
I will awaken to a love that runs deeper
Than the need in me.
While you are sleeping, the new day comes creeping
And life keeps on passing you by
Magic unfolds when the blue meets the gold
And the sun comes to open your eyes.

In a space and time of your own
Lost in dreams in a world full of shadows

Down the street the neon light shines
Offering refuge and hope to the blind
Who stumble in with no thought of tomorrow

Yes I get lonely when the sun gets low
And I end up looking for some winner goal
Yes I should know better but I cant say no
Oh no no nono nono no

The light are low when the music is loud
You watch yourself as you play to the crowd
One more face in a palace of mirrors

One more drink your sailin away
One more dream but its looking okay
One more time to watch the flow of the river

Gerry Rafferty,"We sat up talking right on through the night
And the day had just begun
Then you said let's take a walk outside
And watch the rising of the sun.
And over my head there was so much to see in the sky
Just that feeling of being alive
Don't let it go, don't let it slip away.
We stood around until the sky was clear
It was time for you to go
I watched your figure slowly disappear
As you walked off down the road.
And over my head there was so much to see in the sky
Just that feeling of being alive
Don't let it go, don't let it slip away.
Don't let it go, don't let it slip away
Don't let it go, don't let it slip away.",Over My Head
Gerry Rafferty,"In a dance hall by the river, I was singing in a travelling band
Just another small town night, with a silver moon shining
I remember when I saw you, that first moment when it all began
You looked across a crowded room, and stole my heart away.
And we stood out in the moonlight, in the shadow of a factory wall
Music playing soft and low, and a gentle breeze sighing
And the light on the river was magic, yes a magic that I still recall
Moments come and moments go, but these moments still remain.
Remember how we met, down by the waterside
How easily we forget, all the love that we knew.
So we married our fortunes together, and we sealed it with a golden band
But somewhere down along the road, we could see the flame dying
Now an exiled heart gets weary, like two strangers in a foreign land
We reached the point of no return, a long long time ago.
Remember how we met, down by the waterside
How easily we forget, all the love that we knew.

Gershon Kingsley,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

There was a purpose upon the horizon
A destination
Tangible and fragrant

And I march to ban you
And I march to ban you
And I march to ban you
And I march with a thousand

It's not surprising I should find myself flailing
Having crossed a bridge of certainty
Back behind enemy lines with no room til Tuesday
I didn't even fuck with the temptation
Guard down with little to do
I welcomed old habits like a long lost friend
To spite you

At dawn 'bout a week in Venice
Giving themselves up to the strengths of the menacing darkness
The shrinking hours of light are grey and feeble
The sulky trees sigh dropping their knees in defeat

The temperature falls
There's a big light switch on
And from time to time
Fireworks frightened the cats",Destinations
Gesiel de Oliveira,"Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl 
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? 

At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana) 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) 
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind 

At the copa don't fall in love 
Don't fall in love",Vim Para Adorar-Te

Saw a town that wasn't linked by shores.

As your feet hit the board, or as the beat hits the floor, 
These are the moments that we live for, 
The ones who constantly try, to appease our nine to fives 
They are the ones that justify, all the things that we forsake. 

You are not your job, and you are not the clothes you wear, 
You are the words that leave your mouth so speak up, speak up loud, 
For none of us want to sit, 
In evaluations taking notes for hours, 
We're all sick and tired of waiting, lets set sail.

Are quickly turning into fires
And as the embers are growing and no phoenix emerge
I guess another set back is another lesson learnt.

Though not a matter of choice,
There's still something of worth
In just an acoustic and a voice.
As the new shoots start growing
At the start of the year,
The tree is ready to deliver
Despite initial fears.

[ verse 1: johny see ]
As I walked through 5th ward, I saw this man
He was kind, but he was blind, I snatched his jewelry and ran
I caught up with box and said, ""I think it's worth a grand""
He smiled and he giggled and he shook my hand
We tried to pawn it in to haveg some for fare for the jam
He said, ""it's fake"", and I said ""what? "", he said ""I'm sorry"", I said ""damn!""
My mama threw me out, I called my sister a whore
Now my house is abandoned, my bed is the floor
It's been a week I didn't need, I couldn't take it no more
Saw my teacher miss elaine at the grocery store
I waited by her car, she asked: ""why aren't you in school? ""
Put my gun up to her head and said, ""get in, you old fool""
She offered her keys, cried and said, ""please!""
She promised not to tell and give me a's and be's
I said, ""I want your money, grub, and all I can sell""
I looked into her eyes and she was scared as hell
I knew she was a snitch, I beat her down with my gun
Got happy with the trigger, now I'm on the run

[ verse 2: juke box ]
Now I'm just what you expected, a runner out on bail
Hustlin is my job, and I'm paid well
I'm used to makin money fast, beaucoup cash
Try to cheat me and beat me, my boss is bossin your ass
Once lived sheila, yeah, I meant to kill her
Her teeth was big and gappy, so I called her godzilla
She planned for a party, she said ""bring everybody""
No jive, when we arrived we saw dectective ray mccarthy
He started haul-assin, my fila came unfastened
I fell and went to jail and came back as an assassin
First I start rollin, my pockets started swollin
Havin green is havin power, and you know what I was sellin
Now sheila was addicted, her face looked reflicted
I caught her sellin ass, then and there I should've kicked it
I drove up to her corner and gave her a grin
Asked, ""how much? "", she said, ""20"", I said, ""bet"", she got in
I drove her to a spot that was quiet and dark
Yo yo, turned out the lights and found a place to park
Now I knew the girl was ready, she started gettin sweaty
But all was in my head was 'kill the bitch like freddy'
I dug between the chair, and whipped out the machete
She screamed, I sliced her up until her guts were like spaghetti
A maniac, I stabbed the girl in her tits
And to stop her nerves from jumpin I just cut her to bits
An assassin

[ verse 3: johny see ]
My father was a priest, cold blooded he's dead
Hypocrite, I caught him basin, so I shot him in the head
Poured on the holy water, ""bless the dead"" is what I said
Then heard the demon screamin as his body bled
Now I stole from the poor, lied on the man
Dropped the dime, he's doin time and I don't give a damn
We're not really greedy, we'll help the poor and needy
We'll rock a show and clock some dough, then drink until we're peedy
Drove on the freeway just the other day
I saw a fine hitch-hiker, and I wanted to play
I pulled off the road, so I could offer a ride
She said ""thanks"", I said ""no thanks,"" and she got inside
Jivin as I was drivin, then I asked which direction
She said, ""5th ward"", I said ""we're from the same section""
Made it to my ave, she said out and said ""thanks""
I said, ""yo babe, like won't you chill and have a couple of drinks?
We went into my house, and I filled up her glass
She drank and got drunk, that's when I got in that ass
I banged it and banged it until my thang got sore
I said ""honey..."", she said ""20"", I said, ""get out, you fuckin whore!""
She put on her clothes, headed for the door
Then said, ""welcome to the disease there is no cure for""
Then she started runnin and almost got away
With no clothes I gave chase, makin sure she'd pay
Now she passed by my boy and I knew he was strapped
Red pulled out his gun and shot the bitch in her back
Bare butt-naked I headed for the car
The massacre was from texas, so I pulled out the chainsaw
Cuttina nd cuttin, he said ""johny, man, she's dead""
On the news they found remains of just an arm and her head

Shit?
WILLIE D: Oh, that's what the average ho see when she look at a 
Modern day man.
DJ READY RED: Ain't that the motherfuckin' truth!
WILLIE D: Yeah. And these old fickled minded assed niggas wonder 
Why a ho be with them one day and another goofy motherfucker the 
Next.
DJ READY RED: I think it's time you kicked some more of that shit!
WILLIE D: Yeaaah!

There seems to be a lot of mother fuckers blind to the fact
That a ho is gonna be just that
And this type of ignorance is the very
Reason why so many niggas in the goddamned cemetery
Intelligence is on call
You don't treat a ho like a queen who behaves lika a dog
Are you the type who won't put a ho in front of a trigger
Then you're a ho assed nigga
Goddamned hound
Pound for pound
You knew the ho when she was fucking the whole town
She fucked you and gave your buddies a blow
But your trick ass fell in love with the ho
Tried to change her make her be an angel
You keep putting your damn life in danger
Fronting niggas about that slutty ass trifling crow
You gotta let a ho be a ho

Here's something that I'd like to know (what?)
Why you take that ho, everywhere you go?
You walk around the club wit' the ho in front
Tryin' to keep up with that nasty assed cunt
You say you're captain, but yo' ship she's sinkin'
As soon as you turn your back, the ho is blinkin'
Winkin' her eye at another nigga
But you got her locked down, so you figure
Ho wears your jewelry every goddamned day,
But nigga, you just got the ho on display
Wouldn't let her be herself, cause you's a goddamned wimp
Now you know why hos date pimps
She's a rhinestone freak 5 days a week,
But you get mad when niggas pop on her ass
Goddamned slutty ho, the bars are loaded
Don't try to change her
You let the ho be a ho!

she's a ho, (D how the fuck you know?)
Every time I see the ho she's with a new negro
She's the type of ho that's bound
To wear shorts up her ass when your friends come around
She's the kinda ho that'll make you cry
The kinda ho you have to call before you come by
So why do you wanna kill when she says no more
You ain't the first to be dumped by a goddamned whore
Crazy mother fuckers fighting over hos
Stealing for their asses and jumping out of windows
If a ho wants out I let her sinky ass go
'cause I'ma let a ho be a ho

WILLIE D: Now do y'all follow me so muthafuckin' far?
GETO BOYS: Yeah!
AKSHEN: Hell yeah. I remember I was with this ho named Kim. 
Let her use my car. Bitch went to go see another nigga. I damn 
Near killed that ho!
WILLIE D: I fucked that ho, man!
AKSHEN: You a mutafuckin' lie!
WILLIE D: I ain't bullshittin'! Didn't I, Bushwick and Red?
DJ READY RED: He went up in that bitch, man!
BUSHWICK BILL: On the for rilla, my nigga.
WILLIE D: Akshen, I'm telling you man...

I fucked that ho before you even knew her
Made her pussy go brrrrr when I stuck my dick to her
I knew she was a ho the first time I met her
So I got another ho and took them to the other level of the game
Got them high as a kite
And fucked both of those hoes that goddamned night
Then I sat back and relaxed
As they 69ed and ate each others cats
I dropped them off at home
God damn look at this shit my wallets gone
The hoes beat me but I left it alone
And used that shit as a stepping stone
I played it off the next time I saw the hoe
I just laughed and fucked her ass some more
She licked my ass and sucked my balls
And if I see her right now I can get some more
You gotta let a ho be a ho

WILLIE D: Yeah, buddy. Willie D ain't gonna let none of these hos
Get him down. I ain't cryin' or dyin' over none of you hos. I

And left your trademark upside his head

Friends ain't shit when you're gettin' your ass kicked
But if your buddies want to get in my mix
Chop-chop yo, bitch
It ain't nothin' but a mere formality
Every sucker muthafucka' is a casualty
I kick ass, you won't ever diss
Look at the bottom of my goddamn shoe print
From muthafuckas done donated blood to the kid
Now do you want to make a bid?
I didn't think so, 'cause I'd have yo
Ass screamin' just like a damn hoe
When I hit ya in your goddamn mouth
And show you what a real nigga's all about
When I dispose of your ass like waste
And nothin' but my shoe is in your mothafuckin'' face

Look at you now, muthafucka!

He says, ""I'm sorry, Ak, don't kill me, I was jokin', griff""
That's why your boys are on my balcony and they're frozen stiff
The boy was shocked, then pulled up cops, he looked at me said, ""You're a goner
'Cause you shot and killed the boys who worked my corner""
Pulled back the hammer, put my gun up almost point blank
Shattered his dome, reached in the pocket, took the boy's bank
Got out the Cadillac, the copper, he said, ""Stop it, freeze!""
I aim my pistol for his stomach, instead I pop his knees
Fell to the floor, he looked at me and he said, ""Akshun, please!""
I put my gun between his eyes, said, ""Don't breathe""
He took a breath, and he knew he'd breathe his last breath
That's 20 soldiers and copper, 21 shot to death
I had to leave everything I'd ever worked for 
But best believe, I won't get sentenced for a drug war
But maybe one day in the future I can come back
But until then, I'm goin' home, where I'm from, black
Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face
And ask my posse, they say, ""We call him Scarface""

Hey Conjo, mayn, listen to me, mayn
Now that we got Texas fiendin, mayn
It's time to make the whole fuckin' world start geekin'
We expand across the whole mothafuckin' world, mayn
And we get the dope out there, mayn

Hello, this is Bushwick, motherfucking Bill
      [Yes sir, I'm calling to inform you that you have been drafted
into 
       the United States military]
The United States wants me for what?  Hahahaha
      [Excuse me sir]

Hahaha, yeah yeah yeah, hey what's up?
      [You need to contact your nearest recruiting office immeadiatly
please]
I see your not hip to what's happenin'
I don't give a fuck about you and all that bullshit you stressin'
Fuck a war
To explain, let me kick it to you a little something like this:

(Bushwick Bill)

Motherfuck a war, that's how I feel
Sendin' a nigga to a dentist to get killed
Cause two suckas can't agree on something
A thousand motherfuckers died for nothing
You can't pay me to join an army camp
Or any other motherfuckin' military branch
of this United goddman States of this bitch America
Be a soldier, what for?
They puttin' niggas on the front line
But when it comes to gettin' ahead, they put us way behind
I ain't gettin' my leg shot off
While Bush old ass on t.v. playin' golf
But when you come to my house with that draft shit
I'ma shoot your funky ass bitch
A nigga'll die for a broil
But I ain't fightin' behind no gaddamn oil
Against motherfuckas I don't know
Yo Bush! I ain't your damn hoe
The enemy is right here g, them foreigners never did shit me
All of those wasted lives
And only one or two get recognized
But what good is a medal when your dead? tell Uncle Sam I said

chorus x2 (Willie D)

I ain't goin' to war for a shit talkin' president
   [Fuck fuck fuck a war]

(Bushwick Bill)

In Vietnam a lot of niggas died young
P.O.W.'s got hung
What the fuck do I know about a grenade
All I know is the (????) in my 12 gauge
And what if that pin gets stuck?
Several more casualties show up
This shit remind me of a drive-by
More motherfuckers die by accident than on purpose, why?
Cause they don't know what they doin'
They see if the coast is clear and they start persuin'
And that's when that booby trap springs, BOOM!
Blow a motherfucker to smithereens
They send a sucker to your folks, lookin' stupid
tellin' them you died in the line of duty
Or your ass is missing in action bro
Tryin' to be a damn hero
They bring your folks that duffle bag
The only shit they want to see is that doggy tag
Hopin' that the worryin' will cease
And your ass will be home in one damn piece
But my mom ain't gotta worry about that there
Cause I ain't dyin' in the middle of nowhere
Another statistic, a body in a drawer
Man! mother fuck a war!

Chorus x2

Your lucky that I ain't the president
Cause I'll push the fuckin' button and get it over wit
Fuck all that waitin' and procrastinatin'
And all that goddamn negotiatin'
Flyin' back and fourth overseas
And havin' lunch and brunch with the motherfuckin' enemy
I'll aim one missile at Iraq
And blow that little piece of shit off the map
Yeah, I wouldn't give a fuck (????)
Cause I'm tired of payin' these high ass gas prices
Only the rich benefit, it'll be a cold day in hell before I enlist
To eat shit out a can like a worm
And everyday wear the same damn uniform
(????) breakin' on my funky ass feet
Skin crawlin' cause I ain't took baths in weeks
Not knowin' if I'm comin' home or not
And if I do, I'll probably be shell shocked
I couldn't get a job just a free burial
You know how Uncle Sam treat it's veterans
Absolutely no respect
Get a plate in your head, lose a leg, you might get a check
Or a gaddamn star, you can have that shit
Mother fuck a war!

(chorus)x2",Fuck a War
Geto Boys,"Yeah, it's time to do it like a G.O. once again
You know in 1989 we knocked on the door
In 1990 we beat on the door
Now it's 1991 and we fiend to kick this muthafucka in

Lets talk about a scandal
The album Geffen found too hot to handle
Fucked up the minds of you and yours
The last lp from the Geto Boys

Can you believe those hypocrites
Who distribute Guns n Roses but not our shit
And they say we're a racist act

Ain't that the pot calling the kettle black

Man fuck them hoes
We got new partners and got shit done regardless
Cause our fans are everready down to die hard
Around the globe to 5th Ward

I read a news report
Some lawyer in Florida want to take us to court

Somebody tell that country ass hick
To go suck a dead man's dick

You scream obscenity, but it's publicity
You want hoes so don't act like you don't know
Better fuck with somebody else before you get popped
Cause we can't be stopped

Geto Boys   Geto Boys
Geto Boys   geto Boys

People are frightened when they hear the Boys
Cause we ain't just a bunch of noise
None of that me me rappin'
We let your mutherfuckin as know what's happenin

Bitches get raped, niggas get murdered
Adults fuckin kids in numbers unheard of
It's on the news every hour
Why can't I talk about it?

Everybody seem to be after us
Even the manufacturers
Wouldn't press our disc, you know it wasn't fair 
Fuck everybody who work there

And every mutherfuckin reporter
Across every mutherfuckin border

You said the album wasn't coming out fighter
But when it did you couldn't find your typewriter
Keep lettin the government dictate what you hear
Next they'll put stickers on your ears

Even with that move we got 'em in anguish
Cause we'll learn sign language
We can't be stopped 

Geto Boys    Geto Boys

Willie D is the gangsta of love
Some of my friends sell drugs
I sell knowledge that you can't get a hoe
Cause the game is so not toe  

Promoters took away our tour
Negative press made them insecure
And you wonder why you never see a video
Of the boys from the geto

No radio, talkshow, or magazine were we in
And we still in the top 10
You can't beat that with a bat

Huh, hammer can't touch that
We from the muhafuckin south
Now what was that bullshit about?
That we had to be from Cali or New York
Anybody can make it that got heart
Trenchcoats and gangster hats got my back
Any nigga around me got to pack

So come on muthafuckas, come on muthafuckas, FUCK!

I told you size wasn't shit
That's why I murdered your neices
Wasn't my fault they found they head cut in 88 pieces
Don't let 'em run
Hurry up and catch 'em
You grab an arm I grab an arm let's pull 'till we stretch 'em
Play pussy, get fucked
Means you're better off dead
I wanna see food so I fished in a child's head
Motherfuckers be worried 'cause I'm sick
Dead heads and frog legs
Mmm... cake mix!
Friday the 13th
The night of the living dead
? ? ? ? ? ? walkin' 'round givin niggas head
If you didn't die, I'd say you got lucky
All bodies found dead
Fuck it, blame it on chuckie
But this is child's play... motherfucka!!!

Verse 2:

Aw fuck, chuck's on a killin' spree!
Gimme some barb and I'll start by killin me!
When I murder, I tried to slack off
Now 100 missiles blew a little girl's back off
My name is chuckie, some say I'm insane
You give me some gin, and I might eat a dog's brain!
Give me a motherfuckin 15-pack
And I'll be damned if I don't bring 15 dead niggas back!
A murder contest,
You know I'll win it
Cause in every mailbox, there be a head with a knife in it
I'm gettin hungry
I need to be fed
I feel like eatin' a bag of barbequed broke legs!
Bustin' necks with a motherfuckin' brick!
Half my body is chuckie
The other half is bushwick

Always pumpin' some lead
Haven't figured out a way to get my fist out your forehead
What up
Get up
Sit up
You get lit up
A knife in his neck made a polar bear spit up
A 9, a uzi is my only utensils
Inside his chest they found 10,000 pencils
You have the nerve to try to go against chuck?
With fifty guns aimed at you
How the fuck you gonna duck?
Yo,
When I'm mad, I'm ready to slay
The graveyards are packed
But it ain't nothin' but child's play

Verse 3:

You'd better murder me
Put me to rest
Cause if you don't I'll come out shootin
With my head in a bird's chest
Pissed off,
The way I'm always soundin'
Killed a punk in '82, and they just now found 'I'm
Some say I'm crazy
Some say I'm on crack
Before I die
Cut off my leg and let me die in iraq
A born loooser
Some say I'm mindless
If I get pissed off
You leave naked and spineless
Worse than charles manson
Never havin' a equal
Went sleepwalkin' last night and killed 300 people
When I woke up they had me chained to the floor
When they told me what I did I killed 300 more
Yo
You wanna rumble?
Then go get your war hat
I went to jail for assault with a carjack
I might be small
But my nuts are big
The worst that you could do is let me keep your fuckin kids
Cause I'm a teach 'em how to act
And if they ain't actin' right

Her body's beautiful, so I'm thinkin rape
Shouldn't have had her curtains open, so that's her fate
Leavin out her house, grabbed the bitch by her mouth
Drug her back in, slammed her down on the couch
Whipped out my knife, said, ""If you scream, I'm cuttin""
Opened her legs and commenced the fuckin
She begged me not to kill her, I gave her a rose
Then slit her throat, and watched her shake till her eyes closed
Had sex with the corpse before I left her

Went to the back and grabbed a shovel
Now granny's on her way to meet the devil
Pulled out my .38 and aimed at the bitch
A cop says (Freeze, muthafucka!) Bitch, suck my dick
I said, ""Die, muthafuckas!"" as I blasted

The scent of buckshots in human flesh
Pigs dyin from bullet wounds to the chest
No sheriff's gonna take me on a road
Dark as fuck, and let his pistols explode
Fuck that, cause I ain'ts to die
So I reloaded my Uzi and fired up another fry
It got me crazy as fuck
A ragin psychotic full of that Angel's Dust
The cops had the place surrounded 
Hunted for a way to get out - I found it
Innocent bystanders watch me set an example
I popped one, ""Let me go, goddammit
Scot free
Or all of these muthafuckas comin with me""
All of a sudden the shit got silent
I remember wakin up, in an asylum
Bein treated like a troubled kid

What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
Three black crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go, because I'm paranoid
I keep lookin' over my shoulder and peepin' around corners
My mind is playin' tricks on me

Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope
Can't keep a steady hand because I'm nervous
Every Sunday mornin' I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift while I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
BANG and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's nonsense
I got a little boy to look after
And if I died then my child would be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seems like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this
But to me she was just another chick
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feelin' lonely
My mind is playin' tricks on me

This year Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin'
Robbin' little kids for bags
Till an old man got behind our rags
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back, and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble no doubt
So I swung and and tried to take him out
He was goin' down, we planned
But this wasn't no ordinary man
He stood about six or seven feet
Now, that's the creep I'd be seein' in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Droppin' them 5th ward B's on him
The more I swung the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as death on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punchings on the concrete
God damn, homie

And beat your ass to the size of your dick
And that's small
And you think you're mackin' when you're lackin?
Bushwick is packin!
I'll show your girl how a real man feels
Large things come in very small packages
And while your gettin' on your knees to fuck
A nigga like me's still standin' up
Any bitch will tell you:
As long as he has a big dick, size ain't shit

Liftin weights'll make you bigger
But lift me you'll be a dead-ass nigga
You wanna squabble coz ya think you're tougher?
(Automatic unloading) squabble that motherfucker!
Those are called bullets, they got 'em in every state
To keep niggaz like you in place
And since I'm a trigga happy nigga
Look for your place to be in a
Cemetery, you goddamn sucka
Lying next to another bad motherfucka
Reputation ain't shit coz see:
What you done did in the past don't excite me

I been a stupid-ass motherfucker ever since

The penitentiary became my residence
It wasn't nothin' for me to disfigure
You little nickle-and-dime-assed niggaz
Shank a motherfucker in a minute
And if a riot was goin' down I was in it,
Get off work and discuss my pardon
Chill out and smoke weed with tha warden
Take a motherfucker like you
And without remorse this is what I'll do:
Punk you out and make you be my bitch
And let a nig get shit on his dick for 1 cigarette!!
Any harder then my dick and you're talkin' shit
Carry on motherfucker-
Before the state convict me of assult or something hyper
And I'll end up right back at Riker's, Like a sniper
I'm scoping you out,
You won't even know when I'm takin' your ass out,
I'm equipt and viscious, tolerate no misses,
Rougher than Ulysses when it comes to bitches
Bitch, yea I'm talking to you, some a y'all niggaz are bitches too
You gotta be crazy as hell to try ta fuck up ******
**** 'cause your size ain't shit.

Some stupid motherfucker said he had an advantage
Fuck my size, you wanna do damage?
Contestant number one c'mon down!
You're the next motherfucker Imma clown
So don't get excited like your bid is exact
Cause you ain't winnin' shit but a goddamn smack
When I throw a motherfuckin' right cross
And slap the taste out your goddamn mouth
Now where's the height comin' from?
Don't make me use this goddamn gun
Cause I'll give your ass hell then charge ya rent
Fuck you up like a goddamn accident
Innocent is how I look
Cause a nigga this size ain't supposed to cook
You took me for a sucker that day...

Once upon a time at the Honeycomb hideout
Sugarbear and Mikey sat alone gettin fried out
Lucky walked in with this nigga name Rice Grain
Pulled out a knot and conjured up a dice game
Lucky looked at Mikey and he said with a smile
Where's the silly rabbit I ain't seen him in a while
Mikey turned around and shook his head cause he ain't know
Probably trickin with this bitch from Rocky Road name Cheerio
I'm trippin off this shit cauuse I ain't never seen it right
I'm feelin kind of leary cause I'm higher than a kite
The pipe has really got me on this other level
Its time to mark a murder
My victim's Fruity Pebbles
I'm killin any motherfucker jumpin in my mix
I'm out to get you Pebbles, heard the bitch was turnin tricks
I'm packin up my shit
I'm longin for some???
Up ain't this a bitch Face is on his way to Bedrock
Shortly after gettin their I met up with this crook
Nearly cuttin the bitch in haly like some Shredded Mini Wheats
I'm makin my escape
Sneakin out the back
Fuck I'm being spotted by some fag name Apple Jacks
I put it on his ass so he couldn't come back to key me
Bleedin like a heart, I guess he must have ate his Wheaties
He used to kiss dicks with his partner Special K
I never had respect for homosexuals anyway
I'm on my way to Houston
Played it safe I road the ferry
And ran across this motherfuckin cop name Frank in Berry
He starin at a nigga had the looks as if he know me
He asked about the bear
I said yeah, the bear's my homey
The shit was kind of shady I was nervous from the jump
Arrivin at the docks got the word from Captain Crunch
Arrested for a murder, so now I'm thinkin shit
I didn't know that Captain Crunch was Cookoo for this bitch
My trial came up and now I'm thinkin
The dried up situation needs a little bit of milk
I had a half a gallo and ?? a nigga bought it
Reached and grabbed my spoon and made a motherfuckin run for it

Lock us up for the summer 
Took the brother's name away and passed us as a number 
Just because you legally pack a gack man 
Doesn't necessarily mean you have to point it at the black man

You let your gacks pop 
Because them honkies got you brainwashed

You beat another black man's ass and now you high tapping friend 
Do I have to move to River Oaks 
And bleach my fuckin skin so I can look like these white folks 
Just to get some assistance 
Because the brutality in my neighborhood is gettin persistent 
Cause you want to harass me yeah 
And if I talk back you want to bust my black ass G 
Just like Rodney King 
But if you try that shit with me, its gonna be a different scene 
Try to pull me over on a dark road 
But I'll be damned if I don't grab my nine and unload

You heard what I said 
I want all you crooked motherfuckers dead 
So you better start pickin out your coffin sir

i grabbed the bitch by her head and told her ""spread your fucking legs""
I placed the barrel of my 9 on her pearl tongue
and stuck a shell inside her pussy and said ""now ain't that fun?""
she started to cry
I saw a tear fall from here eye i said ""bitch you must want to die""

and shot up her nigga until he was full of holes g

I stamped on her motherfucking face until it caved in

Geto Boys,"There's far too many of you dying

June, 28 was the date 38
Till the chest plate mommy dear's cryin' at the wake
And everybody's dressed up in black suits
Goin' to pay their last respects to the black troop

Why'd he have to die is the question that we're under
But everyone knows that everyday's a different number
So when your time comes, just remember G
You'll always have a place in this world as a memory

Especially my boys who passed away back in '92
Best believe that all the boys in the hoods got love for you
Wherever we go, wherever we be, we be thinkin'
Of how we hung in the clubs smokin' and drinkin'

Never missin' out on a hood fight
'Cause everyday back in the hood we had a good fight
Everything is changed and people are lookin' lonely
It's gonna be strange spendin' New Year's eve without your homie

But ain't much that we can do
Except pour brew throughout the crew
To make sure we all remember you
And believe me it hurts
To see the boy you broke bread with six feet in the dirt, dirt

There's far too many of you dying
There's far too many of you dying

Another homie got smoked but it's no surprise
Everybody's trippin' 'cause the boy was too young to die
A sad sight to see my homie take his last breath
Everybody's trippin' 'cause they can't accept my homie's death

Another killin' was reported on the evenin' news
Somebody's brother got killed behind a pair a shoes
In the midst of all this shit I think about myself
Wonderin' when somebody's gonna try to take me off the shelf

But I refuse to be another violent casualty
So when I'm rollin', I pack my pistol grip beside my knee
'Cause on the city streets today a brother jus' can't win

When the people you think are your friends
Really ain't your friends, uh and bush wick can't sleep
When everybody aroun' me keeps fallin' six feet deep

There's far too many of you dying
There's far too many of you dying

The pain that's deep inside of everybody grows
As they approach to see the body before the casket close
The person standin' next to me has snapped the flip
Once I seen the casket closed I knew that that was it

The whole entire family spoke on his defense
The choir sung the songs that make us reminisce
And durin' all the singing I broke down myself
When I looked and seen the family that my partner left

And then the choir broke into it's final song
Thinkin' to myself the worst is yet to come
Everyone was headed for the final flight
As we creeped along the gravel on the burial sight

The director said his words and there was not a sound
As they lower my little partner [Incomprehensible] inside the ground
Everybody dropped their flowers on the coffin top
And then they work alone with the concrete block and that's deep

There's far too many of you dying
There's far too many of you dying

A lotta homies die, a lotta mothers cry
I watch tears fall down from their eyes
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to take the chance
They chose the music so they had to dance

Couldn't tell 'em nothin' was a player, had ta have it
Got caught up in the game now ma boy's in the casket
And everybody's lookin' for somebody else to blame
Ashamed to let his mother know that he was in a gang

We used to kick it on the Ave at night
Comin' up tryin' to have the finer things in life
But now my boys gone, I wish he was at home
I wish he wouldn't a never fell victim to the clone

So when I drink a brew for you, I pour some on the block, son
You might be gone but you damn sure ain't forgotten
So on remember whenever or wherever
Dead or alive real partners come together, and you know that

There's far too many of you dying
There's far too many of you dying

Geto Boys,"Up early in the morning lacin up my British Knights
Throwin up my deuce sign, fuckin with the street life
Never knew no better cause my mommy never taught me
Going out to get the shit that mommy never bought me
Only ten years old and I can't stay away from trouble
But you don't give a fuck cause you ain't never had to struggle
And everybody's tellin me its get greater later
I need to get my shit right now, cause it ain't shit in my refrigerator
And I done struggled for my whole life
Seeing my moma laid up with a different nigga everynight
And when you see me you can spot a crook
Cause I'm going through her motherfuckin pocket book
I'm going out to get my papes
Cause she don't give a fuck about me anyway
And my daddy's doing two terms
And all she ever does is sit around and get served
My mommy never hugs me
I'm callin deuce my family, cause these niggas say they love me
I'm steady dustin chumps off
And ready for the battle if the shit would ever jump off
So send my ass to hell
Its eithr being covered up with some dirt, or boxed in a cell
Anyway that's what it looks like
If I don't hurry up and get my ass up out the street life

Chorus:  (Spoken)

		You know the streets is all I know
		This is my way of survival
		You know I've been dealt some bad cards
		But I gots to play them
		What else am I to do, look for a job?
		But until them my family will starve and be broke
		So I resort to the streets
		As a source of income
		I'm stuck here

I step out on my own block
And everyone's throwin up the deuce to little J-Rock
And all my little homies that I hang with
Are either jackin, or mixed up with this gang shit
See it through reality
Never leavin the gang cause its the street life mentality
My homies got  a proposition
Pulled the nigga off some change and said he'd help in my position
So now I'm rollin with the OGs
Puttin in work for the jack, for some overseas
And maybe in a year or two
I'll be able to roll in a Benz like the gangsta's do
Makin hoes ride dick
Cause that poor, broke ??? 
Ain't hittin ??? shit
I gotta lock my crew down
And sew this whole motherfucker up like the Jews town
Develop us a strong click
Break my pops off some dope while he rot
Pops would like that shit
Seeing his little nigga on his own two
Doing shit I heard my pops used to do
A real nigga to this crime thang
And had it going on before his time came
I gots to get my shit right
Until my shit gets right
I'm rollin with the street life

Chorus:

		You know what upsets me
		Is when whitey sits back in they lavish homes and BMWs
		And tell me the streets ain't the place to be
		See it from my prospective
		Poverty strickin, livin on welfare 
		And the government cuttin that shorter every week
		I'm shortin on education cause I'm black
		The corner doesn't promise me a good life
		But at least it shows me promise

Finally after shit got right
I'm wanting out of the gang cause I'm searchin for a new life
But I remember what was said
You come in alive the only way you leave out is dead
So I'm kinda fucked on both ends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin frinds
Cause if they were my friends they'd let me break
Outie five thousand fuck this shit, I'm packin my 38
But first I gotta stay down
Until It's time for me to punch it out and just lay it down
And that's a motherfuckin shame
Tonight I gotta spill another ride with my little gang
So slowly I walked up to it
With no hesitation I broke the window and jumped into it
Unhooked his shit and was headed off
I opened up the door that's what set it off
A nigga came out with a glock jack
And put a slug in my motherfuckin back
And my so called friends
Want me out of the gang cause they don't know if I'll walk again
Now tell me what's that deuce life
Fucked up myself for good cause I was wrapped up in the street life",Street Life

Big dick daddy, droppin you hoes in the sack
Bustin nut after nut on your motherfuckin back
If your nigga wants to make love to you, cool let a nigga know
Cause a nigga like myself just wana fuck you hoe
And if you don't want him to know I won't snitch
You can be his girl but you know you'll always be my bitch

Keep yo bitch right or a nigga like myself will take a smooth

Dick, sucked the whole night through
Ass, licked as if I was a star
This dick is for you baby; wherever you are, hey

[Bushwick Bill]
Bitches I scoop them up like jacks
Stack them like racks and send them home with their pussy off tracks
Cause they be figuring me to be a light weight
But if it gets 'em into the bed, then that's OK
Cause when I get them, I'm doin damage to that pussy hole
Not only do I fuck the body, but I fuck the soul
What other nigga do you know that can handle this
Hijack the pussy from the back and dismantle it
It sounds kind of difficult, but it ain't
The only difficulty that occurs is when the pussy's stank
Cause then I'm a have to send you home and throw you in a ditch
Or leave you for the garbage man you unsanitary bitch
So spread your legs wide open boo
And let a nigga like me get down, cause this dick is for you

[Chorus]

[Scarface]
Bitches say I talk bad cause I'm real
And to me expressin myselfis tellin a bitch just how I feel
I had a couple of women in my life but yo
In 1992 I realized that they was hoes
Cause hoes will straight up do hoe shit
Bitches even more shit 
And ladies will give you no shit
So I kicked back and played the hand that I was dealt
Peep game in the mix, and let these hookers play themself
Cause 80 percent of the bitches I meet ain't shit but money bandits
I front like I'm giving up bank
Stick dick in they ass, and leave 'em stranded
But for women, I got a better tactic cause I love them
They come to Mr. Brad cause their mistreated by their husbands
So I hook up shit to make it right
Just call me tonight
And I'll make sure that everything runs tight
Cause if he don't appreciate you boo
The way that I do
You need to let him run back to his crew
Cause he don't understand what you goin through
But regardless to who I screw
This dick is for you

You roll 'em right the first time but you seldom get to roll 'em twice""

He didn't realize he was the target
I didn't realize what I was doing till he departed
Oh Lord, I'm feeling something I never felt black
I told his momma I was sorry she said ""Sorry won't bring him back""
God gave life to the human race and he alone has the right to take it away

But every time I dim the lights I'm havin' motherfuckin' nightmares
It's been a year since I heard ?
And I can still smell the motherfuckin' gunpowder
What does life mean to me?
I'd trade places with the man a heartbeat if I was granted peace
I try to wipe it out my memory

Verse 1:
[Willie D]
So many problems that exist in my world today
When I'm deceased, I want my little baby girl to say
That he was real
He loved me with all his heart
He loved mama too
Even though they sometimes fought
A young nigga in the ghetto
With plenty of dreams
Surrounded by the police
And many of fiends
At 13 started mobbin'
14 started robbin'
It's hard to have morals and values
When you're starvin'
Abused, misused, and plus a bad dresser
Nobody ever told me I was special
I put a gang of tears in my mamma's eyes
But she died
Before I got a chance to apologize
It hurts to see my baby sister feeling the pain
It hurts to see my baby brother still in the game
Ain't nothin' change but my finances
I still be stressed
All these motherfucking worries got a nigga depressed
I'm just tired
Every night, I pray to Jesus, rescue me
>From the poverty, hate, racism and diseases

He prepared a place for me
And when he do that
I'ma be free, yeah

Cause ain't another
Her kids trying they off they ass
It's gettin' rougher and tougher

Stop storming what they calling this American dream
And why you looking up for a role model
You be your model
Look who we follow

And single parent upbringings

But now my conscience is free
I ask the lord to give me strength
And bless the hood
And keep these fake motherfuckers out my life for good

Willie D's rollin on these 
in a drop top A-Z-you-are-E
With the knock, knock banging listening
 to a song my nigga Face singing
Eardurms just a ringing, my homey brining
A couple of honies to the hideaway
we gone fuck these hoes and straight ride away
Gotta pack confirmed tickets get some sleep
we rolling to the Baby Johnson fight a 100 niggas deep
ain't bringing sand to beach
I got my eyes on some freak ass broads
and menage-a-trois
never kiss and tell I keeps em horney as hell
and take my dick inside that pussy put it under a spell
got more mail than the post office let me remind you
don't stare at my diamonds too hard they might blind you
Freaky Deaky, Fready Deaky Deaky
when you see me rolling past all you got to do is ask

Leavin' opposition in the dust
In mob we trust, fuckin' with us gon' get your bust
It's a - suicide, it's a suicide
You will die, nigga, you will die
Just like your homeboy did
When we teed off on him
And since you want drama, we fend the weed off the corner
And when I ride
All these niggas better ride
So if you hoes got pride
Then bring your asses outside
And let me say your bad side
But don't you never let me see you sweat
I'm leaving motherfuckers silhouettes - wet
And you can take that as a treath
But I'ma make the promise
These nigga here is comin'
Sick enough to let to make a maggot vomit
With the intentions to retaliate
Illuminatin', then evacuate
Fuck the tear drops on the casket tops
Just open up with shots from the plastic glock
That leave your ass get got
It's all about gettin' even
Get them muthafuckas when you see 'em
Stop em from breathin

[007]
Retaliation
Look at all the heat that you're facing
15 niggas agg in your living room waiting
Passin out shit, bags
Click clacks - toe tags
We came and we kicked that ass
Who run this? double-o-seven
Out of 17 and guaranteed to get eleven
I guess you think you're safe
Sorry that you did it
Hoe, it's too late
Bitch, you shouldn'ta did it
One by one niggas get they ass done
Pussy make me laugh, nigga, money make me come
Nigga set for life
All on this in pay-per-view
? callin? shots make you call yo' whole fuckin' crew
We gotcha

[madd dogg]
I ain't playin with this one, pass the pistol
Warriors come out the play when we whistle
What's that sound? is that them - in the background?
I let the mac clown and shut this whole set down
Rap-a-lot mafia's murderous circle
We kill em done, go get your guns
None survive when I scream the die-die
It's the mister from the free time the dumb-dumb
Retaliation is a must
Who in the fuck gave you muthafuckas the nuts
To try to buck
Wanna bust? nigga what? !
It's dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, in the back is where the pistols pump
I lift em up, gives a fuck
I'm quick to bust
Hit 'em up, get 'em up
Once I send 'em up
Now ? ? ? get enough of my gangsta stuff
Retaliation is a muthafuckin' must

[k.b.]
I stumbled out the club ? ? ? ?
Drunk as fuck
And plus my visions is blurry
My face swoll' the fuck up
Clothes all muddy
It was buddy
From last week who I got into that argument
With - came back with his click
Muthafuckas in some deep shit
And so they asses got to pay
Make my way to a pay phone and hit j.
""hey, I just got jumped on
I'm over here at ? ? ?
It's the mob that ? ? to the brain to the gathor
A few minutes later
I saw the muthafuckin' hummer
Here comes big chief
Mac-11, ready to bomb a
Cock suckers

Was gonna touch 'em
Muthafuck' the law
They ass went up, my nigga bust 'em
This is my biz
Kill 'em all

Stayin high as a fuck in a Bentley bumpin Sweet Thing
And we came to reincarnate the real

Goin insane, puttin a bullet in your brain
Leavin you shocked, fuckin the world like Pac
Settin niggas up like Puerto-Ricans to stop breathin
Cause destiny caught up with yo ass and got even
And I'm seein your whole family ripped apart

Dumb muthafuckas with your pick up trucks
Gave muthafuckas jammin sticks up butts
I shoot your asses in the guts and leave your brains on the windshield
You muthafuckas shoulda been killed

Watchin the military blowin bitches up at will
On the brink of startin World War III, fuck peace
Cause to me an A to a K spells relief
Blow this muthafucka up, fuck Sadam
Sneak up on his ass with a rifle, fuck a bomb

When the well being of my kids is at stake I'm alarmed, heavily armed

Weapons bein loaded and cocked, bodies drop
Ghetto niggas, they hang on the corner sellin rocks
Fuck the cops, they brutalize the poverty-stricken
Institutional racism prevalent in prisons
Quick decisions are made with precisions of blood-spill
Gotta make a mill, got a house on the hill
Protect my grill, and avoid gettin killed
Now if I land on the concrete with bloody pants
Lord please, give your homeboy a second chance
Baby need a new pair of shoes, and a college fund
My p.o. wanna know how I got a gun
I'm in the presence of my enemies like in the bible
Will I see heaven if I murder these fuckin rivals?
I'm havin nightmares of niggas' final cries
If I die today, will I be idolized?
I gives a fuck, if you dwell from the east to west

Forgive me what I past did, hustlin for loot

Touch him with my lips, feelin like he blasted
I never seen a man cry
But my lifestyle is fear, sittin around watchin muthafuckas die
The faces of death
Who coulda predicted 2pac would be next?
Read ghetto text: if you live by the sword
Or speak about it too much, you gon' die by the sword
So think about it, do us an injustice, you know time flies
Life, I can't trust it, so I stay high
Six-time felony, no one can handle me
I'm constantly fuckin up my family
To the moms a casualty, I got love

Scarface:
I remember in the 80's me and pops would rock
In a 7 0 chevy with the drops in slot
Use to pass me pepsi cola while he drunk him a pint
Tippin' to the southside runnin' a light
Use to have me up in 3rd ward checkin' his traps
Collectin' his scratch protection' his snap
Use to always tell a nigga keep your mind on paper
Bitches in your head you keep your eyes on paper
Cause a niggas definition is a killa for scratch
You kill a motherfucker you kill him for that
You got caught up in this shit that means you fucked it up
Old man spittin' game so I sucked it up
Old enough to do my own thang got me again
Flip my second paycheck to cop me a lid
Went and seen my homie short dawg that slided me a track
Went to mase's pawn shop and got me a gat
Didn't know this crack shit I got my uncle to cook
With my eyes on my paper I just fubbled and looked
Impatiently waitin' for the pot to boil
Man I can't wait to see your rock from ?
Put my work upon the table and it's startin' tonight
Time for me to bring brad jordan to life
Sat my ass upon the corner till it started to bounce
Glock scratchin' reach that and started her out
It wasn't long before I was goin' for nine
I'm seventeen around millionaires goin' for mine
And if you got off in my way while I was headed for that
You found your ass misplaces with your head in your lap
And niggas is gettin' shiffer with time
That's why you never see me with a partner in crime
I'm down and dirty nigga fuck the world
And that's what separated geto boys from girls you know?

Bushwick bill:
5th ward is the spot where niggas get shot
Hoes sell cock and every block is hot
Niggas start shit but they don't start it with bill
Cause them motherfuckers know they're blood gonna spill
Ever since I was a kid growin' up in the bottom
I beat a niggas ass and if I didn't I shot him
Never gave a fuck about his family cryin'
Bottom line, better his than mine
You come around me with that live shit I kill it fast
I throw a search party for your fuckin' stankin' ass nigga
Cause it's a motherfuckin' rep thang
You got a set of nuts you better let them motherfuckers hang
Even if you're facin' 20 years you never rat
You do your time and you come on back
And if he a homie he really take care of your people while you're gone
And bless you when you come back home
Do your time and don't whine is the motherfuckin' anthem
That's the type of shit most niggas can't phantom
Them bitches tongues come unfurled
But that's what separated the ghetto boys from girls c'mon

Scarface:
I bet you often wonder how niggas survive in the trail
You got jacked and took six and died in your house
And motherfuckers sat and grieved your death
One of them motherfuckers counted up the keys then left
Kind of strange the game it took a change for the worse
Split the brain get the cain get back to your dirt
And keep the jack you did up under your hat
Cause if the word got out you killed him then they killin' you back
I never thought that '86 would bring me trouble again
You'd think but these niggas on some up shit like double your pay
And gives a fuck about respect and joy
So how the fuck you figure niggas got respect for a hoe
But then again niggas always put their trust in a bitch
But in the end it's another nigga bustin' yo shit
Fucked around and had to flee the world
Cause you couldn't separate the geto boys and girls

Willie d:
Geto boys is the motherfuckin' shit never forget
Them southern niggas made your mind play tricks
Never the less I left the group in '91
Niggas was mad, I had my gun
They had they guns too I wasn't snoozin'
Cause I knew that if it came down to it they would use 'em
If it was goin' down right then I didn't give a fuck
We was gonna tear this whole motherfuckin' city up
And nigga that's real comin' from the south
You wack ass rappers watch your motherfuckin' mouth
Preachin' that positive bullshit you can save
Cause your positivity ain't gettin' motherfuckers paid
It's g.b. and willie d reunited
Sendin' niggas back to the studio to get they shit tighter
And niggas thought it wouldn't happen again
But we sat down and settled our differences like men
And put the bullshit behind us
Cause fuckin' off money ain't a plus it's a minus
We did what other niggas to big to do when they twirl
And separating geto boys from girls c'mon

Man on phone:
A.j. you know I spent 23 years in the prison. you know I'm still in prison
You know they they uh uh reannounced us, blacks, we represent 37% of the
Prison system throughout the country. 37%. but we don't represent but but
12% of the country. now that's diproportionate and ain't no joke you know.
It's it's now by coincidence or by ? it's by design. by the year...2015.
They gonna have 70% of our community locked up. I'm talking about black
Gonna be locked up within they community. it's gonna be like it war

Three story mansions and fancy cars
Now picture that a Geto Boy walking that life G
Coming up in a house full of negativity
Everybody drinking everybody smoking
Everybody cussin' and fussin' like hell I'm hopin'
That I can raise up outta this mess
I'm too damn young to be distressed and oh yes
I went and got what I thought was mine
Did the crime the time and a mother fucker didn't whine
But fuck that shit the jailhouse ain't for me
I got places to go and people to see
want to make millions and live to see my grandchildren
That's the mother fucking dream that I'm building
Anybody ain't with that can step the fuck back
It's 41 for the poor one never cries
I used to dream about getting that cash
And buy my mamma a crib and I did before she passed
The good life has no equivalent
It ain't a fantasy no more because I'm living it

(Chorus x 2)
Geto fantasies
I don't live here any more
Oh no no no geto fantasy

He said he'd open opportunities
But to me ain't no open opportunities
So shut your Mickey D's down in my communities
'cause it ain't helping feed me or my family
And that's the reala
And you can give a twelve gauge to a nigga
Ain't got scrilla
And now you got a born killer
Cap peela
And while you build your penitentiaries for my children
I plant seeds for my children
So when they cross these roads you'll be prepared
And never show no respect to these hoes that never cared for
Plus they only come around to the black folks
When they run they campaign and they lack votes
Once you vote em in they don't know
Once you vote em in they can't do jack for you
I guess it's true when they tell me you don't fight fair
You turn my ghetto into a seething messy nightmare

(Chorus x 2)

Geto days keep ghetto thoughts relevant
But geto ways make murder imprevalent
You feel me?
I been through many geto episodes all the same
When will niggas learn to use they mind and maintain
See you're always on the defense
Relying on your street sense
I told you once to use them sense to make dollars
Bot to make a mother holler
That hard shit's kind a hard to swallow
Tomorrow there'll be more killings in the hood
From child abuse to drug dealings it ain't good
They want to see us stuck
Shit out of luck
Can't nobody ever say I didn't try to give a fuck
'cause I did and I do
The rest is up to you
No matter what you do to your hood stay true
And you'll make it
Can't nobody take it

Now where were them bitches at it's time to kick some asses
He told what had happened and now I'm thinkin' ""fuck""
I'm callin' up South Acres it's time to get 'em up
My motherfuckin' neighborhood is quick to get with static
Never showin' fear cause these niggas never had it
Everybody's trapped, quick to go to war
Quick to kill your ass quick to jack your car
So if you see some shit then I suggest you punch it
Cause what's about to happen you may not be able to stomach
Killers killers killers steady smokin' fry
So nigga lay it down or die motherfuckers die
Fuckin' with my family you dick is in the paint
So don't think that it's shit cause niggero it ain't
Shit to break 'em off I'm breakin' 'em off with chunks
Siggedy south iggedy acres ain't no motherfuckin' punks
And drive-by shootin' ain't the motherfuckin' shit
Cause niggas plot hits after motherfuckin' hits
Killin' you ass for kicks doin' shit for the murder
And since you want me to die you gots to die cause you deserve ta
Now here take this motherfuckin' slug (bang)
Cause fuckin' with the kid is the grounds of being drugged
Mister mister Face the hardest nigga being heard
Cause all I have in this world is my balls and my word
I'm sick of motherfuckers thinkin' they run shit
Until you face to face wiith Scarface you ain't done shit
I'm killin' off you mark ass niggas with a slug from a Glock motherfuckers
I'm a born killer, I really thought you knew bitch
I'm slappin' hoes and cappin' fools
It ain't shit",It Ain't Sh*t
Geto Boys,"I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles
Oh that shit is on?
Let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth

At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Four walls just staring at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleeping with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't living right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close
I start sweating and blood starts coming out my nose
It's somebody watching the Ak'
But I don't know who it is so I'm watching my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say take a chill, B
But fuck that shit, there's a nigga trying to kill me
I'm popping in the clip when the wind blows
Every twenty seconds got me peeping out my window
Investigating the joint for traps
Checking my telephone for taps
I'm staring at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind's playing tricks on ya

I make big money
I drive big cars
Everybody know me
It's like I'm a movie star
But late at night something ain't right
I feel I'm being tailed by the same sucker's headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot
Or is it the one I beat for five thousand dollars
Thought he had caine but it was Gold Medal flour
Reach under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lying
I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's going down let's get this shit over with
Here they come just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfucking trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start giggling
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go because I'm paranoid
I keep looking over my shoulder and peeping around corners
My mind is playing tricks on me

Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope
Can't keep a steady hand because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Praying for forgiveness
And trying to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift while I drive
Having fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I died then my child would be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feeling lonely
My mind is playing tricks on me

This year Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treating
Robbing little kids for bags
Till a old man got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was going down we figured
But this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's the nigga I'd be seeing in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Dropping them motherfucking B's on him
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody, from punching on the concrete

Yo, let's do it
... we gon' do this one
Let the beat ride for a minute though
Will {?} in the house from the town
FaceMob in this bitch, 'bout to tear shit down
Uh-huh, yeah, there it is
Yeah

Still the, truth in the game ain't a damn thing changed
Prone to tote heat up and then shoot flames
Double the O.G. of a deuce thug thang
Bitches who know me know how I do dames
Still, fuckin with James we roll in this shit hard
I locked up the South, he locked the 5th Ward
Loaded and cocked, I'm known to be a block bleeder
Known to get paper and I ain't fin' to stop neither
I got {?} drive Porsches and shit
Ranch got horses, golf courses and shit
Eat shrimp steak crab raw oysters and shit
And still fuck around with all my boys in the bricks
International nigga, I been in and out the states
Kingston, Brazil, bitches feedin me grapes
I can, cut it and bake, all I need is some soda, a plate
A microwave, Pyrex and a cake
You can get it how you want it, what I'm spittin is free
I don't need to hold in court what I can hold in the streets
Niggaz know how I was raised so ain't no question these
Consequences you gon' face when niggaz fuckin with me
There it is

[Chorus]
One for the niggaz want to cross me up
Two for the bitches want to toss me up
Three for the people tryin to get my mail
want to send me to jail so they can lock me up
Four for the hoes who want to block my shine
Five for the snitch who went and dropped that dime
Six for the suckers who ain't got no game
That's a God damn shame, that's why he hatin on mine

From the North to the South I don't need no passes
You bitches get out of line, I'ma bleed yo' asses
Look man, I ain't the huffin puffin type
I'ma put that pistol in your motherfuckin life
Mayor {?} call my crib, I be gettin them greens
Fuckin the finest hoes that can fit in some jeans
Take an interest in politics, Chopin and Van Gogh
Shoot a motherfucker up and then go vote
They say variety is the spice of life, so we'll
fuck the black broads and lay pipe to the whites
Puerto Ricans and Latinos, Japs and Filipinos
What is y'all trippin fo'?  Pussy is pussy
I ain't gotta come where you live to shoot you in your sleep
I know niggaz in yo' hood that'll do you for me
Youse a bitch-made pussy born with no nutsac
I'm a motherfuckin stand up cat, that's on the one

Spot a fine-ass bitch and I'm scoopin her up
You can sleep on me nigga if you're stupid enough
But I'll be standin in your bed receivin from your woman
You can bust in, but not while I'm cummin
Cause I'm cummin everywhere, in her hair, on her face
on her earring, even on the motherfuckin ceiling
Keep it playa with a playa, let me get my nut
After that, you can kill the bitch, I don't give a fuck
Yes indeed, Chuck smoke good weed
If it ain't hydro get the fuck out the do'
You niggaz drink a few shots and your faculty slow
I down the whole fuckin bottle like it's H2O
Got the heart and the steel and the will to bust
I'm the ""Little Big Man"" with the big ol' nuts
Don't fuck with bitch-mades, too real for that
Got the fame and the name but I still will jack, nigga

It's the return of the murderer, maniac madman
The fully automatic M-11 in the handbag
The ending of it, the beginning of the Baghdad
Your brains blowed out, body in a trash bag
Unidentified, chalk him up a John Doe
Got most of the pieces, but they ain't found his arms though
It's far from a record, I'm different than these rap dudes
A real nigga, won't hesitate to clap fools
Ski-mask you, come up to where you lay at
Cock back, squeeze, and put him where your face at
The nerve of you niggaz, believin I'ma play games
You know who I'm wit, so I ain't gotta say names
{*blam*} you pussy, {*blam*} cause you a black Jew
Ain't never had love for y'all, make me clap you
And it's a done deal, don't fuck with what the truth is
And hide behind that motherfuckin desk but when the truth's here
it's on for ya, that mean your lifeline shortens
Death to the niggaz who disrespected the Jordan
I'm not a pop nigga, fuck what radio say
Fuck what video do, but this is all day
hood nigga, I ain't gotta show you what my life like
Cause you don't persecute a motherfucker like Mike
I ain't a house nigga scum like you fools is
I was bred born and raised in this true shit

[Chorus]
Funny how a nigga get caught up in all the glamour
And then they finally come to grips that this can happen
to anybody, won't discriminate who catch this
Get in the way and you a victim of a death wish
A declaration of a war and it's a warning
Follow the leader but be aware your opponent
is in the window got guerillas where you rest at
And prepared to hit a motherfucker, bet that

[Willie D]
Aight, let's get serious
Fuck the rap game I'm the realest nigga, PERIOD
If you ain't feelin me you know how it goes
Jump bitch, I cain't wait to kill one of you hoes
It's on if you got beef
You can be a cop, a drug dealer, or a pro athlete
Bottom line, I don't give a fuck about'cha
If I pop you in the neck, I bet some blood come out'cha
While your label only behind you greasin his dick
Your stupid ass on a video, cheesin and shit
J ain't shorted me a dime if he owe you bucks
The way I see you a bitch and you deserve to be fucked
Willie D is the nigga that'll bloody your clothes
Don't think you know me cause you know the hook to ""Baldhead Hoe""
I light you up with a sawed off; and stab yo' ass
in the leg, in the chest, in the back and mouth

[Bushwick Bill]
Aight nigga; stab him in the leg in the chest
in the back and mouth, let 'em haul him off
Give me a motherfuckin handy shotty
and a plug of PCP, I'll kill anybody
Bust him in the ass 'til he's still
I'm Chuckwick bitch, your achilles heel
A short nigga quick to give a tall ass-whoopin
Got a chip on my shoulder bout the size of Brooklyn
Lookin to start shit, I ain't scary like Scooby and Shaggy
Piss me off you better Duck like Daffy
Even if you in a rest home I'll pop ya
Even if you got a vest on I'll drop ya

Who do you call when these agents want you dead
and they hit these penetentiaries and niggaz make a pledge
So I dip and duck the feds, all my homies duck out on indictments
Caught up on the phone, talkin prices (hello)
25-to-life's the mandatory minimal
My whole community gets treated like they criminals
Why are them bitches gettin motherfuckers hung
Got a C.I. on the inside and everybody's sung
Mothers and fathers separated from they sons
Households are broken, you couldn't hold your tongue
If it's yours, say it's yours, take the case, do your time
When you was out here gettin money from it e'rything was fine
Now you cryin in your jail cell, stressin on the case
And the D.A. is at a nigga every single day
I can see it in your face, in the middle of your soul
You in question of your manhood homey - keep it cold

We don't trust in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets we do battle in the hood

See I be on some street shit, don't talk to police
I won't accept a visit from agents who want to see
if I got shit to say about a nigga case
I'm a motherfuckin nigga through and through, I ain't gay
Know a nigga caught a case and he took his 25
Sat it out on a pill, and gave him back that time
A soldier in his mind and his actions said the same
Told a cracker tell your mammy suck his dick and {?} James
Ain't no motherfuckin game, we been livin this for real
When the government is workin, real niggaz never squeal
Right here the truth revealed, Troy you a mouse
Yeah you rappin but the homey Lil Pots can't get out
Niggaz they hit the pen, they get charged, then get out
On a rule, 35, he a bought it for the cops
You can hear it in his voice, I done listened to the tapes
Now you showin up in court, testifyin for the state

[Scarface]
I'm knowin all the scams, all the tricks to the trade
Know a nigga tryin to get clean, and you get in the way
Know a nigga tryin to get green, and you stick out the bait
Cause a nigga like a dopefiend, can't rehabilitate
Still stickin to the G Code, we playin by the rules
We don't fuck around with new niggaz, cause new niggaz is fools
We don't photograph the homies, that'll catch a nigga up
On a picture you a victim, bottom line nigga fucked
Only connect the real, stayin down with the true
I got love for you Ant, you a real nigga Spook
My nigga Spoonie Gee, I can only name a few
But there's a thousand motherfuckers in the pen bulletproof
So this one here for you, I'm a rep it 'til I die
Fuck a 5-K-1, check his P-S-I
Send his ass to the top if he say he sit at home

She don't want to be with me no mo'
Ain't her fault she just tired of this dumb shit that she don't know
Whether to, throw in the towel or if he gon' grow
And if he do, where is he gon' go?
Got a letter from an old friend, I read it and cried
When he told me that his girl just died
Right out of the blue, breast cancer, wasn't nothin to do
Now I'm sittin here and thinkin of you
Tryin to come to amends, cause really I done wanted you in
You the only one I trust as a friend
I know I'm on my last leg limpin with this bullshit written
But I still gotta bring it to light
Spent half of a lifetime missin cause I would not listen
Confused about my wrong and my rights
They tellin me that time heals wounds though
This wound gon' need some stitches; I got testimony for niggaz
You doin what you do but when the shoe gets flipped
Standin on the other foot got your boots and shit
When you back up and analyze, fix shit and finalize
Before you leave the shit alone just try
Maybe there's somethin you can do to rectify what's did
And plus you gotta think of the kids
That's kinda just the way life is, you either gotta live or you die
At least that I can say that I tried

[Chorus: Scarface]
Cause I tried, I tried to do the best I could
Sometimes I guess my best ain't good... enough
Cause when it's over, said shit done
You sittin by yourself mixed up
But I tried, I tried to do the best I could
Sometimes I guess my best ain't good... enough
Cause when it's over, said shit done
You sittin by yourself mixed up, but I tried

[Willie D]
Faster than a crackhead, can pawn yo' shit
Willie D'll put a foot in you bitch
I sold dope, robbed folks, had to make ends meet
Since 5th grade, I been up in these streets, tryin to get it
Raised by a single mother, two sisters two brothers
I used to think she didn't love us
Cause she beat us so much, plus she came home drunk
But every now and then she'd knock on wood, and say
I tried to do the best that I could - and I believe her
Cause she was treated evil out the box
You can't get what you ain't got
Momma I was young, hittin licks, started helpin you out
'Bout the closest that you came to a man of the house
I was talkin back, walkin through the do' gettin smacked
You used to brag to your friends on how, well I rapped
We never really got along but when you took sick
I was at your side 'til you died
I wasn't the best son but I tried

[Chorus]

[Bushwick Bill]
I've always been crook, never given up
But the past few years has been really rough
Felt like givin up a couple of times
Take a jump or plant a slug deep, up in my mind
Fuck it I'm dyin, done wit strugglin for mine
Sleepin on fans, knowin there ain't no use to me lyin
Change my name for anonymity's sake
But a four feet dwarf that be on television's hard to miss
I get pissed over little shit, little shit drive me crazy
Then I start thinkin 'bout my babies
I cain't go to jail, I cain't die
Who better to teach 'em 'bout this cruel world than I?
Their mommas won't let me see 'em, I still pay my support
Cause once you give life, life is bigger than yours
Maybe I'm not all you expect me to be
But when it's done and said ultimately, daddy tried

Geto Boys, Willie D

We was livin' on cold facts, cops sat in old 'Llacs
Couldn't get along with T Jones, so he rolled jack
I was on Prozac before I was 12
Spent my senior year in high school, sittin' in jail

To no avail, I was screamin' out and nobody heard me
Messed around and got shot but it didn't deter me
I think I was fourteen, so my boy was one trey
Cut my hair one day, left my crib and got sprayed

And expired right away, nuttin' to say, sad chapter
Around here, either you get killed or you get captured
Sister girl, I ain't know what you was dealin' wit
Pointed the finger at you, now I'm feelin' like an idiot

But I'm wiser now and I seen the world
It's messed up, how they treat us Geto Boys and girls
The doctors tried to resuscitate, it was too late
I got a daughter named Kain and a son named Blank

And they be askin' 'bout you, all the time
I try to be a better man, sometimes I fall behind
So if you feel some extra weight on you, don't be alarmed
Don't move, don't flee, that's me leanin' on you

I'm leanin' on you

Y'all wonder why I act crazy, life don't phase me
For me to still be above ground it's just amazing
Wasn't aware bein' different gave me intangible wealth
That's why I, took a gun and tried to kill myself

My folks got the blame of course, I used to ask
Why did God make my brother so tall and me a dwarf?
This ain't no 'Poor little me song' that's so phony
I got a good life, I'm just sharin' my testimony

But could you imagine bein' me, for one hour, one day
One week, one month, one year? Get out of here
You'd never make it, life's not fair
Everywhere you go, people point, people laugh, people stare

They don't care, so I don't care, most of the day
I feel awkward but I believe I'm goin' to hell if I don't pray
As I laid, on that hospital gurney, fightin' for my life
I felt the demons touch my body then I saw the light

That was you, I know it was you
Cause all the love in the world from my family couldn't pull me through
Lord, when it gets really rough
You're the only one that's strong enough to hold me up
That's why I lean on you

I'm leanin' on you

You're my one and only friend, ever since I was a kid
We've been in and out through thick and thin, tryin' to get a win
Broke as fuck on the corners like a nigga had diplomas
Back in 1985, skippin' class, gettin' high

Fat Turner we were walkin', I remember you was talkin'
'Bout this lick we was supposed to hit and turn us all to bosses
So we took that trip to Austin, and we came back with this package
That would later turn this strongest friendship into us scrappin'

Ain't too sure about what happened, all I'm knowin' is it was money
Had a nigga wagin' war against who I thought was the homey
Shoulda known this shit was evil, by the way it did my peoples
And the whole entire neighborhood fucked up behind this needle

Now we roam in the Regal, windows tinted, dem bangin'
Pistol grip on the frontseat, smokin' and steady drankin'
Drunk and I'm steady thankin' we probably shouldn't left it
Cause every time that a nigga drops a record you arrested

It's depressin' but life and it's lessons'll leave us guessin'
Gettin' out, was a blessin' but lately a nigga stressin'
Which leads me to this question, was money the only reason we feuded
Cause now that we got it, homey let's keep it movin', let's move

See how far you can take it, two eye or one eye navigate it what

[Chorus]

I know this cocksucker pullin me over because of my skin
But the secret is to win, so I hold it in
I'm yessir'n, no sir'n, but when he pull off he diss
A motherfuckin, dick-suckin, redneck son of a bitch
All it takes is one pussy who ain't gettin none
to catch you on a dark street, and put you to sleep
Dude was one deep, at the sto', he said I ain't no ho
Got clapped in the back of his 'fro, woo
It didn't have to go like that, believe me mister
Someday, niggaz gon' respect these pistols
Play the safe, get out the way, when a fool got the ups
Pride'll get a motherfucker shot in the guts
And remember this before you grown, and the day that you gone
Greed it don't last too long
The secret is to {?} up out the game and have money for life
Not to stick around 'til you lose all your shit to the vice

Gangsters don't dance pop, we boogie on some hard shit
Fuck the V.I.P., we buy the bar
and it's a party goin on, but we came in here to close it
Twenty niggaz deep in the corner ready to roll shit
They dancin freaky, lookin sleazy as fuck
Ass bouncin everywhere, tryin to tease me with butt
But we ain't drinkin, we just chillin, we ain't sweatin these hoes
And I ain't here to answer questions, I'm just lettin you know
that if your cousin got a label or your partner can rap
Nigga cool, do your thizzle, give your partner some dap
But if you come up in this muh'fucker cappin in here

Pussy niggaz on that bullshit get put in the dirt
So recognize what I be about, I'm mobbin for life

Chuck Nice still in it, I ain't switchin it up
Weed smokin in the boys room, livin it up
Blue suits lookin stupid, I ain't givin a fuck
5th Ward, bloody nickel got me hittin it what
I'ma move it to the back, I want to look at the show
See this chick I used to mash comin up through the do'
I approach her on some cool shit, I'm walkin her in
I'm in town for a minute and I'm wantin a friend
Fire up another phillie, steady feedin her lies
Eyes rollin to the back of her head, she was high
She was stupid like a snake, steady lickin her lips
{?} drugs up out the bird, so I pull out my dick
Started flashin at the party, I was drunk as a fuck
Full of weed, 'bout to conceive and twist it in public
'Til this chick walked in, said she's lovin the show
Started askin me to dance, I was tellin her noooooooo!

[Chorus]

[Willie D]
Walk through the do' and the DJ announce
Stop the motherfuckin music, Willie D in the house
He backed on it with my jam, that nigga was cool
He wasn't a bitch-ass ho like some of these fools
Keep the waitress on her toes, tipped her a bank
Northside niggaz just love to crank
Does any one of y'all fools up in here got a gripe?
We kickin y'all motherfuckin ass tonight
Come at me sideways, I don't care if you law
I'm a dot that eye, and check that jaw
Dragged across the bar top partner
Slam you on the dance flo' and stomp the shit out ya
Somebody give me a drink to calm me down
It can be Wild Turkey, gin or Crown
I like 'em big, don't fuck with malnourished chicks
Now shake that ass you dirty bitch

They came back on 'em, y'all can't stop us
Tried to set me up wit yo' system but can't pop 'em

Nigga matters when and where you scheduled to fight
Fuck with Willie D I'll bust yo' fuckin head to the white

Cops ain't about shit
Want us to walk the straight and narrow when they crooked like dicks
They steal and they lie, they snort up their nose
They drink and they drive and they beat up on their hoes
So what you got the fingerprints, I left 'em on purpose
I don't care about the guns and the german shepards
Spray pepper in my face, I'ma shoot you trick
It's Geto Boys, we don't play that shit in Houston bitch

Geto Boys,"I'ma born killer, you're face to face with scarface
You tried to ice an x, but that's a motherfuckin waste
Your schools fucked up g
And your momma shoulda warned ya about a nigga like me
Cause I don't weep and I don't sleep
Save that motherfucker black, cause talk is cheap
And uh, since you got beef
Lets take it to the streets and I'mma bring it to your ass g
I'm commin from the heart son
And I don't take no shit, but I'm about to start some
Now which one a you hoes wanna jump
If you got static, then get it off your chest punk
Cause I ain't bar none
If you're feelin lucky then go ahead and get cha some
I ain't with this fucked shit
If ya ain't in trick, then get your ass in ya trunk bitch
Cause I'm about to square it off
Hit ya ass in the chest with the tech and try to tear it off
Send you back to mommy, it's a plastic
And hadda bitch out huntin for a casket
I'm on the for realla tilla my nilla
I'm a born killa

(chorus)(2x)
I'ma born killa
Born
Killa
""don't fuck with me""

My momma did her part
But it ain't her fault that I was born with out a heart
In other words I'm heartless dude
I don't love me, how the fuck I'mma love you?
That's right, you guessed it
I'm legally insane, marked mannick depressive
I'm takin all types a medication
To keep me out the mood of premeditatin
Yo, the log around my lone is worse
I'm havin thoughts of killin me, but I'm killin you first
Mr. kindness talks but I don't listen
A victim of society fucked by the system
My whole life's been a see saw
I'm up one day, down and out on tomorrow
Right now I'm even more upset
Some shit that happened to me that I don't think I'll ever forget
You think I'll let it die, but I ain't
It ain't because I want to, it's because I can't
I'mma getcha but I ain't goin into it
Cause ain't nothin to it but to do it
See it ain't no sweat to me
Cause in the fo place, you fucked up the minute that you stepped to me
I'm not your average dealer
I'mma born killa

(chorus)

Now I'm livin where I can cause I'm homeless
Can't make point calls cause I'm phoneless
I ain't, I'm starvin duke
I can't go to mommas house cause mommas starvin too
Better grab that 12 gauge
Cause that's the only way a niggaz gonna get paid
I'm on my way to my old bank
They know me real good and they don't think that I'd gank
Had my gun in my trenchcoat
Now getcha ass on the floor
And don't think about pushin that panic switch
I'm gettin paid and you're gettin killed bitch
Take notes to the message I gave ya
Ya dyin ho and can't nothin save ya
I'm doin bad, so I'm goin bad
Huh, and you never expected that from brad
But there's a lotta things pressin me
And ain't the nigga to let the mortredresser dressin me
So I'm comin out winnin
100,000 in the case now I'm comin out grinnin
But the shit didn't flow smooth
The security guard had to run and pulla hoe move
He reached for his pistol
The 12 gauge went ""boom"" shoulda heard that motherfucker whistle
Hit him in his chest
Now which one a you motherfuckers in here wanna die next?
Nobody made a move
And I got away smooth
And that's how it is nigga
I spared a couple a lives, but I'm still a born killa

Look me in my eyes, tell me what you see 
Do you think I'm cra-zy??? (AAAAAGHHH!! Just bein me) 
Sometimes I wanna die, maybe I'll be free 
Free from all this bullshit that's constantly surroundin me 
(I can feel it in my head) I see when I'm asleep
I don't wish to discustin, cause it done been too deep 
I'm tired of bein' stepped on, and past around like weed 
Look me in my eyes (Look me in my eyes) 
And tell me what you see (and tell me what you see)
Can you see my future, and what lies down the line? 
Is it just my test, or is it just my time? 
Time for me to pay, for all the wrong I've did 
I forgot to be picked off, when I was just a kid 
A poison in my mind, tryin to find relief 
But I can't get no peace, cause Shoemaukers been chasin me 
Tryin' to set me up, bustin down my streets 
Blockin' up my door, to see if he can catch me 
But I don't sell no dope, so fuck what niggas say 
Fuck Ronnie Carbone(?), and fuck the D.E.A. 
And fuck these undercovers, that lock me up for weed
You can search me all you want to, but you won't find no cheese 
And I ain't finna snitch, cause I don't know a thang 
Don't ask me shit bout Steve, don't ask me shit bout Jane 
I know you crackrs pissed off, I can see it in your eyes 
I'm down with Rap-A-Lot, until the day that I die
(Until the day that I die) 
So fuck you in ya asses, you know it's all a lie 
You just wanna destroy me, just like you did my guy 
But now I must expose you, and tell my boys the truth 
Listen up my niggaz: ""The F.B.I. been watchin' you"" 
Especially if you black, and tryin to leave the streets 
And get off in this music, you see the way they doin me
Runnin in my crib, makin niggaz lie
Nigga get a scapegoat and take this 25
You know I ain't no dopeboy, ain't never been a mule 
I admit I use to sell rocks, but that was back in school 
Now I just do music, and smoke a little weed
But not enough to run a dope house, so why you fuck with me? 

[Chorus] 
Look me in my eyes! 
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see what I see?(My eyes!) 
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see a Geeeeeeeee? 

[Scarface] 
Look me in my eyes, I've told all I could tell you 
And now you know too much, if you leak a word I'll kill you 
You think that I'm insane, partially deranged? 
You've had your chance to pick my brain, now explain 
What's up with all these nightmares, this long rewinding road
That leads me to the same place I started from;
Right before I left home
(Look me in my eyes!) I thought you was a shrink 
Diagnosed my symptons, I give you time to think 
OK your time is up, now analyze my life 
Please remove your glasses, look me in my eyes
(Look me in my eyes, my eyes) 
You seemed to be confused, I raised up off his sofa 
Put back on my shoes, because this sessions over 
I headed for the door, he stopped me in my tracks 
He said he had an answer, he told me to come back 
He spoke the book of Matthew then he spoke the book of Luke
But he stopped at Revelations, when he just spoke the truth
And told me all my answers, I would find in his book
If I just stopped and looked, if I just stopped and looked 
Told me to seek in he who seeks he shall find 
Then he put back on his glasses, and looked me in my eyes 
Looked me in my eyes

When I was growin up nobody seemed to give a shit
And that's what makes me one hard son of a bitch
Since they ain't give a shit, I ain't give a shit either
Sweet 16, time to stack me up some ki's
Learned the game of hustlin, fuckin dopefienders
Sellin niggaz beat, in other words amphetamines
My game was more advanced, sellin speed I'm goin broke
Got em up with Floyd and Floyd had fronted me some dope
Learned to rock it up, now I got it sold
Time to go for broke, motherfuck who I owe
Business started boomin, started movin powder
Motherfuck the bitches I want money and the power.. yup!

Money and the power, money and the power
I ain't fallin short I got the
Money and the power
Yup!
Money and the power, money and the power
Bitches on my dick cause I got
Money and the power

Bought me a Caddy, 30's and vogues
Brand new crib, brand new clothes
Mom would ask questions, and often pitch a bitch
Where am I gettin the money? Mickey D's ain't paid me shit
I'd make up a story, just to get her off my back
Uh oh I got a beep I think my boys are out of crack
Everything was smooth, exactly how I played it
A dollar to be made, best believe a nigga made it
Nickels dimes and twenties, and sixty cent bumps
Nigga rollin hard, stackin paper like Trump
And I ain't give a fuck I told you that from the jump
Didn't worry about no static I had a motherfuckin pump
Ass out of line, word em up a nigga sprayed em
Momma told me shoot first, and ask questions later..
Six hundred bucks a motherfuckin hour
And I ain't fallin short cause I got money and the power, yup

Money and the power, money and the power
I ain't fallin short I got the
Money and the power
Yeah..
Money and the power, money and the power
I got it like dat, cause I got
Money and the power

There goes 21, and still stackin 30's
Brought my brother Warren Lee down from New Jersey
He helped me for a minute then he started screwin up
Said fuck gettin paid, I guess my brother'd rather fuck
Bitches ran his life, and they're still runnin Lee
I guess he doesn't realize the bitch is fuckin me
It really doesn't matter, cause Ac'll never tell
He can stay broke, but I got dope to sell
I step out on the cut, shit was lookin funny
I ran back in the house and started callin up my money
I signaled for my workers, to bring in all the dope
I can feel the bust and sure enough in comes the 5-0
Niggaz stayed relaxed but they was friskin niggaz up
If someone said my name then I was definitely fucked
But I'ma play it cool, if I kill I gotta kill
Fightin for my shit, I never ran and never will
Come to find out, they wasn't fuckin with my boys
Busted a nigga who said he paid em, talkin noise
Hehehehehe.. I guess the juices are sour
But I ain't fallin short cause I got money and the power YUP!

Money and the power, money and the power
Sold a million records I got
Money and the power
Yup!
Money and the power, money and the power
Best to come clean, cause I got

Our lifestyles be close captioned
Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
In the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetery
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious
Just smile for me now

Smile for me, won't you smile (smile for me now)
Just smile (smile), smile for me
(What ya looking all sad for, nigga you black, smile for me now)
Smile for me (nigga you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)
Won't you smile (no doubt, smile for me now) just smile
(And the next generation)

Now as I open up my story
With the blaze a your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly
Up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone
But I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine
To many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it'd change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over a foot-large, undercooked, raw, taking a dick
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile
Smile

Smile for me, won't you smile (smile for me now)
Just smile for me

Fuck the world as we elope And witness furious speeds
Of nasty questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin', fuckin' thoughts laced with weed
Learnin', duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin' 
Inhalin' Sherm smoke, visualized the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to dis us
Takin' pictures for the feds, and desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins
Since I ain't in many penitentiaries the best revenge is fuck friends
We military minded soldiers, bustin' shots blindly
Tryin' to find Jehovah to help me
Somebody save me
Lost and crazy, scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words make the world change
And still I smile nigga
 
""And now a moment of silence, let us pray""

""And as you journey into outer space 
May the angels help to lead the way
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac""

Posizione certa ma la strada è deserta
Fuori è come dentro, voglio solo stare comodo
La mia nemica è solamente la fretta
E stare male non mi importa più
Sono in controllo di me stesso ora
Che sono andato senza camminare
Catapultato in una vita nuova
Ci vuole cura a togliere le schegge
E la mano sicura e le dita fresche
A stare fuori dalle logiche del gregge
A dire come si è invece di come si vorrebbe
Sale come febbre che io non voglio perdere
Senti come è urgente e lungo le mie vertebre
Sale come febbre che io non voglio perdere
Senti come è urgente e

E non mi importa più di tutto ciò che è stato
Non c'è la rabbia e la paura che mi ha spaventato
Adesso sono qui dove tu mi hai lasciato
Tra le mie braccia stringo ciò che sono diventato

Ora so bene, io ora sto bene
Ora so bene, io ora sto bene
Ora so bene, io ora sto bene

Taglia a fondo quando scatta il panico
Come la lama di un coltello a serramanico
Come pensarmi già da quell'altra parte del valico
Sono come le nuvole, con la mia pioggia carico
E stare male non mi importa più
Sono in controllo di me stesso ora
Che sto imparando come camminare
2000 Strade in una vita sola
Io divago diviso tra le due cose che amo
Come il dottor Zivago
Ho fatto il miracolo in viaggio tra le due sponde del lago
La carpa è diventato un drago
E ho affilato le unghie chi mi capisce mi raggiunge
O lo fa quando sarò arrivato al dunque
Non posso più aspettare di accontentare chiunque
Se so che non ci riuscirei comunque

E non mi importa più di tutto ciò che è stato
Non c'è la rabbia e la paura che mi ha spaventato
Adesso sono qui dove tu mi hai lasciato
Tra le mie braccia stringo ciò che sono diventato

Sono diventato questo,
Al resto non ci penso più
Basta un attimo adesso,

Ghemon,"Tu mi hai raccolto sul ciglio della strada con un cucchiaio
L'umore sull'asfalto che camminava raso
Stanco e sporco con I capelli a caso
Pieno di lividi e un grumo di sangue al naso
Pronto a riniziare tutto ero come appena evaso,
Coi pensieri color canna di fucile
Che viravano sul verde di una bile in attesa di travaso
I nostri muri sono spaventose distese di mattoni e di rimorsi
Benchè il passato paia riproporsi
Ci siamo fatti tremare le vene ai polsi bevendo verità
A grandi sorsi, prima di raccontarti I miei
Mostri e prima di sapere I tuoi trascorsi
Cose che fanno feriti e morti prima ancora di indisporci

Io per te mi perderei e non m'importa niente
Se penso a come sei spericolato crimine,
Mi ero distratto a vivere e il destino ha mandato te
Un tempismo quasi infallibile, che a pensarci fa ridere

Io non vengo per attaccare, non ti devi difendere
E nello spazio di un respiro dirti che tu sei
Come vorrei luce e buio infinito in cui

Io per te mi perderei e non m'importa niente
Se penso a come sei spericolato crimine,
Mi ero distratto a vivere e il destino ha mandato te
Un tempismo quasi infallibile, che a pensarci fa ridere

E mentre avevo fisso lo sguardo al cielo mi sei
Caduta in braccio e neanche ti chiedevo
Unica tra mille dee senza velo venuta a farsi
Togliere le spine e pregare il mio mistero
Dagli occhi solo conferme, cerca in fondo ai miei quando vuoi riaverne
Macchina veloce fatta apposta per me
Che guido sicuro ed ho il piede leggero e le mani ferme
Il tuo corpo, il mio tempio
Metto in asse il nostro baricentro
A ogni impasse che starò vivendo
Rovista tra le lame sparse nel mio petto
Siamo come un esplosivo pronto a detonare
Questa fiamma ci fa innescare le cariche
Spiega le ali stiamo per volare
Noi due siamo un altro paio di maniche.

Ma sono schivo, quasi le sette, ancora l'alba ed io scrivo
Dei graffi che lascio partendo e i baci che vorrei all'arrivo
Stringo gambi con spine e rami d'ulivo
Le valigie in giro
E le promesse di portarla al mare un giorno prefestivo
Si vanno a fare fottere
E lo so che sto mentendo a me per primo
È il tipico comportamento passivo aggressivo.
E' la stessa storia ripetuta sempre
Faremo poi, ma viviamo mentre
Solite feste piene di gente
Che cazzo ci trovano di divertente?!

Prima del previsto

Nel buio pesto, zitto, rovisto

Lei mi chiama e sento la sua voce che esclama
Torna a casa da chi ti ama
Lontana, con una nostalgia che mi sbrana
Torna a casa da chi ti ama

I ricordi che ho cancellato non li posso contare
Il mio lavoro tiene lontane le persone care
Ed è singolare che non riesca più a pensare al singolare
Non sono poi egoista come appare
Fuori guardo il mondo dietro a un oblò o dai finestrini,

Adesso un'orchidea ha presto il posto dei coinquilini
Arrivi a trent'anni ma poi vai in crisi, acquisti sicurezza
Ma il portafoglio è pieno di scontrini
Check in, check out, c'è più disincanto
Nel raccontare storie sul palco quando canto
Se mi ricordo come mi chiamo è già tanto
Sennò guardo il nome in alto sulla carta d'imbarco,
Ma ogni giorno qui è un esame
E mi sta stretto come i jeans di un denim designer,
Rotaie, catrame, voglio poter stare con lei, ok?
Amen.

Torna a casa da chi ti ama

Ghemon,"Ogni strada che sembra non avere più l’uscita
È una gara in cui questa vita vuole metterti
Ogni scala che verso il cielo fa la sua salita
È una sfida in cui certe volte devi perderti

Il muro avanti al tuoi occhi ha più di una crepa
La strada è cieca, ma ha due mani d’acciaio e un cuore di pletra
Tu vai maneggiato con cura in ogni tua plega
Sei fine porcellana tenuta dentro a una teca
Il reschio l’ha visto, nascosto in ogni storia
Perchè tristezza e gioia spesso si mischiano
Qui ci sono urla, quant’è difficile trovare la tua voce
La tua lingua e tradurfliela

Ogni strada che sembra non avere più l’uscita
È una gara in cui questa vita vuole metterti
Ogni scala che verso il cielo fa la sua salita
È una sfida in cui certe volte devi perderti

Transinato come in una danza vorticosa
Quando sai di avere tutto ma manca qualcosa
E ti fai film e viaggi, vai a rimuginarci sopra
La mente non riposa, i pensieri sono nastri di cellulosa
L’aspettativa spesso crea pathos, nemici immaginari, l’ansia da risultato
E scarichi la frustrazione in uno status
Senza capire che sei il primo ad aver sbagliato
Per te loro hano la colpa, loro sono il male che bussa alla tua porta
Ma a forza di ripeterlo diventi uno stereotipo a tua volta
Chi grida che è pulto spesso ha la coscienza sporca…
La testa alle cose migliori, l’aria nel polmoni ed il fumo fuori
Manovratori senza rotta, impariamo a nostre spese dagli errori
Col cuore nel calzini in attesa che un giorno voli

Ogni strada che sembra non avere più l’uscita
È una gara in cui questa vita vuole metterti
Ogni scala che verso il cielo fa la sua salita
È una sfida in cui certe volte devi perderti
Ogni strada che sembra non avere più l’uscita
È una gara in cui questa vita vuole metterti
Ogni scala che verso il cielo fa la sua salita
È una sfida in cui certe volte devi perderti

Ghemon,"Dicono che da un posto piccolo non può venire niente di buono
E che un fulmine di guerra non può partorire un tuono
Noi dentro ad un garage abbiamo inventato un suono
E con il maquillage ci somigliano non ci clonano
Scuola media dovevano legarmi alla sedia
Scuola superiore per ore prove con le parole
Sognavo il loro volto anche col vento a sfavore bendato
L'avrei centrato senza margine d'errore.

(Perchè) certe era troppo ma ci ho creduto
(Perchè) mi sono sempre ripetuto che

Io non mi sono mai seduto
(Perchè) certe era troppo ma ci ho creduto
(Perchè) mi sono sempre ripetuto che

In quella scuola per gli altri io ero un alieno
Nessuno sopportava che fossi atterrato sul suo terreno
Per tutti ero uno straniero
Per questo sto sempre di meno a casa mia
E sempre più spesso su un treno
Sono diventato questo
Sapevo sarebbe successo ma non mi immaginavo a quale prezzo
E anche se do per scontato lo spazio che mi è concesso
A volte mi scordo che il viaggio è stato pazzesco.

Mi chiamano dall'altro marciapiede e fanno bravo
Mi dicono lo sape sape sapevamo
Ah beh, a me si apre tutto uno scenario
Mi dicono grazie grande
Sempre grintoso cerca di salutare quando sarai famoso
Noi lo sape sape sapevamo mi dicono
Lo sape sape sape sapevamo.

Parleranno sempre perché è l'unico piacere
Che si può permettere chi non sa tacere
Devi avere una visione e va oltre la visuale
Non è da dove vieni ma è dove vuoi arrivare
Pensa il sarcasmo che ha la vita delle volte
Ti rifà le domande dopo che le ha già risolte
Ti ridà le certezze dopo che te le ha tolte
Costringendoti a stare insonne per una notte.

In testa un disastro

Dentifrici incrostati,
Nei miei, pomeriggi svogliati.
Uscire in tuta, andare giusto al parco,
Col dramma che ti finisce il tabacco
Intanto, cibi surgelati,

Nella malinconia dei nostri nomi,
Scritti in una lavanderia a gettoni.

Why can't you rescue me

I'll never forget, the times when we balled together
I'll never forget, the love, hugs, smiles and tears
And the strength to help me conquer my fears

I'll never forget, the day we met
I was on Gravestone, trying to find a address
You told me that your wife, had just lost your baby
I never met a man, so hate free
Lately, I've been drunk as fuck
I open up a cold beer, as soon as I wake up
I live in Screwston Texas, that's my home
Banging Screw since 9-2, ask my T. Jones
When Fat Pat died, we was all alone
That boy was the coldest, on the microphone
Screw took it harder, than anyone thought
It's hard to be apart, from someone close to your heart
South Park from the start, all of a sudden
The whole nation, all bout the Screw Shop on Cullen
November 16th, I sat and cried
Cause that was the day, that Houston Texas died

[Verse 2]
I'll never forget true love see, it's gon last forever
Keep my feet on solid ground, so we could ball together
Since a young one never done one, stay true to the heart
You kept my head above water, gave me spark from the start
You put the mic in my hand, plus put your trust in me
Dodging cases being a G, you got me out of the streets
Gave me the capital of Texas, so I could throw away the pyreeces
Put a queen on my shoulder, when nights were cold as misses
Hustling smiles appear the tears, the tears from younger years
Until they find us riders, make sure you standing here
S.U.C. for L-I-F-E, Screw blew one with the streets
Slowed down originator, keeping the trunk on beat
My faith in G-O-D, putting the world up under my feet
Making imitators duketators, bow down and can't compete
From a G to a G, this here's for you to me
Staying down putting it down, screaming Screw for eternity

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
Whoever knew he would create a new sound, never been heard
Transform a simple name, into a household word
He gained fame but never changed, never switched gears
When you met him it was like, you been knowing him twenty years
Was never fake, blessed to make the rap scene elevate
Genius, watch that boy slow it down and still accelerate
God gave him a gift, and my partna knew how to use it
But the love I got for Screw, ain't got nothing to do with music
Cause when he left, the physical was consumed
But his spirit manifesting, everybody in this room
A real partna forever, I know I can never be him
But if I make him my example, when you see me then you'll see him
S for slowing it down, see cold creating
are stands for realer than real, and never hating
E forever lasting, effect never corrupt
W for the world, cause that's what he screwed up

Man I'll never forget, the difference time can make
Man I'll never forget, coming down in the 8
Man I'll never forget, we drunk the pint straight
We been free styling, since them old grey tapes
And then came the day, that we was making them G's
Had them niggas lined up, like we was slanging them ki's
But we ain't slanging D, we just moving C.D.'s
People coming to the shop, way from over the seas
But still we some G's, or should I say that we back
Coming down in a Impala, with the candy wet
Coming down MLK, with the music that bump
We was swinging and banging, steady popping the trunk
Say what's up to that Gator, Mafio and that Pat
I know why y'all looking down from heaven, watching over our back
When they mention Screwed Up Click, they goin' say that we done it
Man them boys done blew up, like the flight 800

Legendary status Screw, steady slowing it down
For H-Town for sure, we done lost a soldier
We goin' finish what you live, and I'ma put that on the Clover
It ain't over, pour and sipping the plain soda
Switching lanes over, in my black Range Rover
The Chemist that's right, I done shed some tears
All the car shows we wrecked, and bled for years
You one of my peers, DJ Screw you kept it real
You one of a kind, so you one out a mill
I'ma stay representing, South-side for live

It was you in my corner, through the heat and the rain
Can't call one time, you didn't make me smile
Took a fall in the Penn, boy you fed my child
Kept my name on fire, like I never left
Kept your eyes on my family, and never slept
Snatched my ass out the streets, and put a mic in my hand
Put my strap on the shelf tray, my fiends for fans
I was hard head misled, seeking for bread
Without the music in my life, I know I would of been dead
But the Lord sent you to me, like a guardian angel
When my feet was caught up in a tangle
So please smile for me, cause Screw you got me throwed in this game
I salute you with my fist, your name was never in vein
See the plack on the wall, all our dreams came true
And I'm still giving thanks to you

But I shoulda known not to keep my lil' brotha so close to me
It was this nigga I jacked along time ago for a quarter ki
Shoulda been knocked his head off and the 
Situation wouldn't be I let him slide
But he didn't let my brotha slide when he drove by
I lost half of myself when younger brotha died
You know what my reaction was
Go spill that mothafucka blood

Caught him slippin' in front the club
Then proceeded to fill his ass wit slugs
This is for my fallen soldier
My fuckin' brotha
Reminiscin' over you cause I'm gonna always love ya

Reminiscin' 'bout my lost thugs
(Some niggas die on the battlefield)
Reminiscin' 'bout my lost thugs
(Some soldiers die that's hard to kill)
Reminiscin' 'bout my lost thugs
(Damn I thought this nigga would never die)
Reminiscin' 'bout my lost thugs

I'm reminiscin' on my lost thug hopin' you restin' up above
An if you hear me, feel me from me to you dawg it ain't nothin' but love
No explanation needed I know you didn't want to be here no mo'
It was like you were puttin' a pistol to your own head
How you was on that dope
You was bored with life I could tell by the stupid things you would do
Make the spot hot by killin' a nigga just to see the shit on the news
You was Lucifer seduced when you let loose as if killin' wasn't real
Pull the trigga then grin
Just so a nigga could see the shine on your grill
You was a could blooded killa but you was my ace
My dawg, my round
Ain't a nigga that could take your place
Me and you have a bond that could never break

Ghetto Commission,"I'm from the dirty south where niggas go to prison just by word of mouth
Slangin quarter keys to make them G's is what it's all about
I was brought up in the city of Gretna had nerve with that nigga pepper
That's you got to put pressure on me to make it so they test ya
I used to hang across that water that mighty nine and other sections
While lounging in the club, I packed a snub nosed Smith and Wesson
Fuckin' hoes, split the blunts and optimos, that's a war
These niggas out chea cut throat, so the crime rate never falling
It's a swamp nigga, we all ghost fuckin riders as we stunt niggas
That scrappin' shit ain't happenin' see you dead if yous a punk nigga
We floss around in Lexuses, from the boot to Houston, Texas
Any nigga that disrespect us, receive a slug though they vest

I'm from where niggas end up lookin like funnels
When they crossing my tunnel
Left in bloody puddles, so it's a must, I represent my jungle
The bricks bitch, Marrero, where we ride slow
Go to war with Calicos, sending niggas to their burial
I'm tellin' ya niggas'll be smelling ya, back at the canal
Niggas know we living foul with televised murder trials
We hustle, duckin' JP's in laced up Ree's
White T's, we keep our rocks in the same place we keep our teeth
We meet at club James, known for blood stains
Niggas stay in front of Tina's, get caught up in the game
Nigga Chateau there's Place, back of Ames, and the Villa
Betty street, Garden road, west bank, home of killers

From the east bank to the west bank, it's our thing
From the third ward to the ninth ward, it's our thing
It's a N.O. thing, an N.O. thing, an N.O. thing
Throw your hood up and claim nigga, it's an N.O. thing

Let me tell you about them boys in the fifteenth ward
Look they ain't playin
Any altercation with the enemy in they vicinity, they sprayin'
When you see them niggas with the white handkerchiefs
You get to the land of the lost
'Cause these niggas bout they paper, bout they come up at any cost
Many niggas done got killed on the battlefield of McClendon Ville
Ya ain't even gotta question, if these Christopher Homes soldiers real
They knocking nuts off back in the cutoff, them niggas bout it too
You doubt it, go test 'em, you can be another bloody body too
If I was you I'd keep my tool slippin' round them Fischer fools
Dark side, light side, both sides, fuck, homicide rules
Them boys over the hump poppin' trunks if you gettin' outta line
Algiers niggas packin that iron, respect our fuckin mind

Now all you hear is ninth ward this, nigga ninth ward that
It's Mr. Magic, puttin' my fuckin hood on the map
You wanna die motherfuckers cause you're fuckin with G's
You dig your own fuckin' grave when your fuckin with these
So where my niggas at, throw your fuckin' nine in the air
Respect my mind, I represent it, like I just don't care
Desire and Galvez, nigga Dauphin and Flood
Be the only motherfuckers ever show me love
It's cause of me ninth ward comin up like a storm
So when you see me identify me by the nine on my arm
And if I die motherfuckers better sound the alarm
City under siege, Clinton couldn't stop this bomb

Fuck with us you gettin slapped, only way survive the gun jam
Third ward, parkway, all the way, AK Spray, now tell me who's the baddest
The click I roll with will leave you in the basement
Call your mama, tell her make a replacement
That's nine months she wasted
No years I be facing in the crescent
Tryin' to teach an adolescent, fuck them niggas I'm suggesting
You keep ya mouth closed, before ya body wind up with holes
Exploding blows, with blood all over your clothes

Check it, I'm camouflaged motherfucker, I'm bustin at they click
I make moves and keep these boss bitches up on my dick
Been camouflaged up, ever since a young buck
I hit the scene like nigga what, do anybody wanna fuck
With this murda murda killer, blood spiller with rhyme
Or I cut your life short like my part in the last don
So much of a soldier even drove a tank to my prom

Get your act together you ain't gotta live like this 
Girl you pregnant and you still smoking, 
What you trying to do poison your seed? 
God bless you with a child and you give him praise with your weed 
And you still run the streets thinkin' that your friends is your friends 
But tryin' to move on and watch them stub you in yo back in the end 
And all I can tell you I hope the best for yo unborn seed

You figure if you please this nigga you can come up on some loose cash 
You had a baby by this nigga, he ain't trippin' off you 
He to busy paper chasing, so where that leave you? 
Got another mouth to feed now 
My eyes can see that you regret everyday you ran the streets now 
And I can see yo lil sister walkin the same path 
Take any nigga with some paper, and he'll be up in that ass 
My eyes can see why niggas call females bitches and hoes 
'Cause you sale yo precious bodies, cause you sale your precious soul

Oooh ahh, Ghetto Ma-fi-a
Comin at you live I mean
And we we just, don't know no
stress, we just roll up Devine and ride
In Decatur
Blowin up like some MegaMen (bitch)
Dodgin all you chickenheads
Did you hear just what I said?
Our destination is the hood
and we quickly comin your way

Verse One:

Uhh, I remember trampin, late at the sto'
Had no idea, what I was in fo'
  Just me and my nigga, supplyin fiends
  Broke as hell, we're chasin dreams
See it may seem, like we can't come up
But we a team, Nino, keep your head up
  From sun-down to sun-up (what?)  I'm a hustler
  Gotta get my gun up, we're quick to tussle
We had to muscle, for a crack position
Niggaz didn't want to let us roll, had no intention
  And not mention, we had to shoot it out
  Lives of a lynchin, had you hidin out
But now we ridin out, in the Delta
Tryin to grind it out, without no shelter
  You shoulda seen us serve them niggaz like a waiter
  ... in Decatur

* Chorus *

Verse Two:

Now we were tight, like Mike and Pip'
Rob a nigga, they bet' not slip
  See I'm equipped (with what) with a nine and a dope bomb
  I've been trampin so long, people call me dog
Where you from?  Straight From the Dec
But shit is real, you got to ride with your rec
  Uhh, we stole Big Boi's car, and got our strip on
  We got the rims the music, and the cell phone
Then we would drink, drink til we fell out
If bitches don't fuck, they got put out
  And you didn't sell out, crunk up the jury
  I paid your way out, gave you the fury
Yeah, fools know we real, cause they dap us
Niggaz know we on, cause they shop with us
  Just show me a team that's greater
  .. from Decatur

* Chorus *

Verse Three:

See they all know, we got the steel
We got tires, and Adams, and Thomasville
  Yeauh, I know you real you hold your own in any hood
  In Prarie Homes, Carver Homes, and Hollywood
Kirkwood and Summer Hill they spoke it real
I'm here flippin grindin, gotta pay a bill
  Yo, I pack the steel, got no time for the switchblade
  I was out my mind when I trapped off ? aid
See, every dime we stuck, they was stole
Make most of my money (off where) off Candle Road
  I gotta kill my pressure, they had me hot
  Hoes on the strip (where) in Flint Rock
Never buy our dope, without a scale
Learned that while I was trampin, in Scottsdale
  And did I mention, we livin greater

I ain't one of the man that are doubting it
I love the sound of it
That rapid percussion
Nocturnal strings
Lewi White baseline
Maniac melody
I'd rather that than a beat from Alchemist
So don't ask what genre my album is
I've be blessed on the buttons
I might get another one in the charts
You think man are calling them blessed for nothing, nah
This harddrive's got a thousand hits
And guess what, Zdot's the next stop
So man are giving him a shout for dis
And I might grenade a beat Wiley made
When it comes to grime I be highly trained
I should have been on the first Pow!
But it's way to late for complaints
And I make a lot of MCs feel like they're leveling, yeah
I could take Usain in a race
How is it these

Gate's closed gotta catch Dr. J's
Blowin' my hand, rub on my nose
Tap the glass, stop frontin' Duke, fresh pair of jeans
Look I got loot, eleven in the Bass boots
Heard a screech pull up, these Jakes flashed me 5 pictures

Flew in two days ago to see his fam'

The whole Staten Island shittin' on you
Wisdom Bird's pregnant out in Baisley
Hold up snow in your ear, fresh baldie tried to change up
Not trunk today, still lookin' fly, still slammed up hung
Your mom pop in your trunk, slow your pace
Starks fixed your face, copped out the 6, five years probat'
You dealin' with a lot of science, motherfucker we're watchin' you
Make me want to lick shots at you
You disgust me, screwin' me down, grab my gun
Go 'head bust me, heard you hate Jake that's what it must be
Hands behind your back, spread your legs
Just found a roach in your tray
It's not mine fucker, what I said
You met the 13th nigga
A multi million dollar operation is based upon it yo
Where in the Hell's the RZA?
He's sellin' mics, wildest joints
Special made to go up in your hand and which went out on point
Switched to the next scene, I'm at the crib buggin' out
On how po' live, hatin plus harassin' the kid
Park the truck in the double face garage

Yo, aiyyo he said I had fly ankles
Plus my bangles was star-studded out, Ice cut it out!
Every time we attend somewhere, you act real terribly

You switch up, last week you burned a old lady's retina
I thought them thick Coke bottle jammies might protect her
But it didn't Pah, the lady's blind and it's all your fault
It went down to jury court and you walked
On stage you fuck with nigga's faces, glaciers
Hittin' off with Cristal bottles, bing wind up in the basement

Chip Rocks known for his wedding day, bitches give you props
Look you tied a knot, understand you hot; you got my man popped

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Whatever burns, burns eternally
So take me in turns internally
When I'm on fire
My body will be
Forever yours
Nocturnal me

In an ice-capped fire
Of burning wood
In our world of wire
Ignite our dreams of starry skies
And you and me
As realized our bigger themes

Oh, take me internally
Forever yours
Nocturnal me
Take me internally
Forever yours
Nocturnal me",Nocturnal Me
Ghost,"Living in the night
'Neath devils torn asunder
You call on me to solve a crooked rhyme
As I'm closing in
Imposing on your slumber
You call on me as bells begin to chime

Are you on the square?
Are you on the level?
Are you ready to swear right here, right now
Before the devil
That you're on the square
That you're on the level
That you're ready to stand right here, right now
Right here, right now

Hiding from the light
Sacrificing nothing
Still you call on me for entrance to the shrine
Hammering the nails
Into a sacred coffin
You call on me for powers clandestine

Are you on the square?
Are you on the level?
Are you ready to swear right here, right now
Before the devil
That you're on the square
That you're on the level
That you're ready to stand right here, right now
Right here, right now

Are you on the square?
Are you on the level?
Are you ready to swear right here, right now
Before the devil
That you're on the square
That you're on the level
That you're ready to stand right here, right now
Right here, right now

Right here, right now
Right here, right now
Right here, right now
Right here, right now",Square Hammer
