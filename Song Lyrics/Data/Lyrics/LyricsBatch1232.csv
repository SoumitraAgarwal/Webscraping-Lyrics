The Monkees,"I've known for a long time
The kind of girl you are.
Of a smile that covers teardrops,
The way your head yields to you heart.
Of things you've kept inside
That most girls couldn't bear.
I've known you for a long time,
But I've just begun to care.

I've known of all the heartaches,
I've known of all the pain.
I've seen you when the sun shines,
And I've seen you when it rains.
I've seen you make a look of love
From just an icy stare.
I've known you for a long time,
But I've just begun to care.

I know I've been blind
To not have loved you all this time,
But the image of you wasn't clear.
I guess I've been standing too near.

Oh, it's taken me a while,
But I have finally found
What you are to me;
And that's what really counts.
And what you are to me
Is something we can share.
I've known you for a long time,
But I've just begun to care.

Oh, it's taken me a while,
But I have finally found
What you are to me;
And that's what really counts.
And what you are to me
Is something we can share.
I've known you for a long time,
But I've just begun to care.",Propinquity (I've Just Begun to Care)

The Monkees,"Walkin' down the lonely street,
I need someone to meet.
I run across sweet lookin' you,
Do you know what you do?

Oh, you tear the top right off my head;
Blow my mind.
Yeah, I'm goin' blind.

Freakin' out in the afternoon,
Lookin' at a daytime moon.
Talk to me, I'll talk to you,
Do you know what you do?

Yeah, you tear the top right off my head;
Blow my mind.

The Monkees,"By Bill Chadwick and John Chadwick
The king of Zor, he called for war
And the king of Zam, he answered.
They fashioned their weapons one upon one
Ton upon ton, they called for war at the rise of the sun.

Out went the call to one and to all
That echoed and rolled like the thunder.
Trumpets and drums, roar upon roar
More upon more.
Rolling the call of ""Come now to war.""

Throughout the night they fashioned their might
With right on the side of the mighty.
They puzzled their minds plan upon plan
Man upon man
And at dying of dawn the great war began.

They met on the battlefield banner in hand.
They looked out across the vacant land.
And they counted the missing, one upon one,
None upon none.
The war it was over before it begun.

Two little kings playing a game.
They gave a war and nobody came.
And nobody came.
And nobody came.
And nobody came.
And nobody came.",Zor and Zam [TV Version]
The Monkees,"I'm a millionaire
Without a care in the world,
I have played the game,
I've made the grade, I've shown them all.
I'm a teenage idol just starting a tune,
No, it's just the ceiling in my room.
I have got more friends
Than I've ever had before,
But, are all these friends
Like the ones I knew before?
Hey, look, there's my old schoolmates there at my back door,
No, it's just the ceiling in my room.
If I could only be part
Of the things that I see,
I'd trade all the wealth and fame
You've given to me,
Oh, I want to be free.
But, no matter what
My future may bring,
I always will remember
Just one simple thing.
That when all my visions contain only gloom,
I know it's just the ceiling in my room, my room, my room.

You tell me things I know that I've heard somewhere
You're standing in the places and you're staring down through faces
That bring to mind traces of a girl, a girl that I knew somewhere

I just can't put my finger on what it is
That says to me, watch out, don't believe her
I can't give any reasons girl, my thoughts are bound down in a whirl
I just can't think who in the world was that girl, I know I met her somewhere

Someway, somehow this same thing was done
Someone, somewhere did me this same wrong

Selling out from compromise
Who to love and who to hate
The foolish from the wise

But today there is no day or night
Today there is no dark or light

The Monkees,"We were speaking of belief
Beliefs and conditioning
All belief possibly could be said to be the result of some conditioning
Thus the study of history is simply the study of one system of beliefs
Deposing another and so on and so on and so on
A psychologically tested belief of our time is that the central nervous
System, which feeds it's impulses directly to the brain, is unable to
Discern between the real and the vividly imagined experience,
If there is a difference, and most of us believe there is
Am I being clear?
To examine these concepts requires tremendous energy and discipline
To experience the now without preconception or belief
To allow the unknown to occur and to occur requires clarity
For where there is clarity, there is no choice

The Monkees,"In a long and involved conversation with myself
I saw precious things come into view
And I poured through the files taken off my mental shelf
I dusted off some memories of you

Then I thought about the times when all the fair was green
How the phoenix of our love, first flapped it's silver wings
All the urgency and passion of each new day as it happened
And how it all mellowed as it grew

I remember the times that our laughter would explode
And how you would turn to hide your smile
And then the hours of silence while the perfumed candle glowed
And both of us meandered on for miles

I remember the time I said, I really had to go
I remember the tears that filled your eyes
Then I touched your hand and told you that it really was a lie
And though you never knew it dear, I cried

Well it's amazing how time can so softly change your ways
And make you look at things that can't be seen
And how the years that roll by can start you listening
Not just to what they say, but what they mean

So forgive me my dear if I seem preoccupied
And if the razor edge of youth filled love is gone
But we're both a little older, our relationship has grown
Not just in how it's shaped, but how it's shown

So forgive me my dear if I seem preoccupied

You were the girl that let me follow you
You used to hang out in the alleyway
You sewed a button on my shirt one day
I asked around until I found your name
Then underneath the arches in the pouring rain
I said - You (yeah, you) I want you
Every step of the way

I know that things are gettin' better
I know it's gonna be OK
So baby don't go - I ain't gonna let ya

The Monkees,"When the world and I were young
Just yesterday
Live was such a simple game
A child could play
It was easy then to tell right from wrong
Easy then to tell weak from strong
When a man should stand and fight
Or just go along

But today there is no day or night
Today there is no dark or light
Today there is no black or white
Only shades of gray

I remember when the answers seemed so clear
We had never lived with doubt or tasted fear
It was easy then to tell truth from lies
Selling out from compromise
Who to love and who to hate
The foolish from the wise

But today there is no day or night
Today there is no dark or light
Today there is no black or white
Only shades of gray

It was easy then to know what was fair
When to keep and when to share
How much to protect your heart
And how much to care

But today there is no day or night
Today there is no dark or light
Today there is no black or white
Only shades of gray

But it did not seem quite right
Piano wire cut her neck in two
I was crying all through the night

And she's in the sod
And I live in her house of God

Burnt her clothes and I pawned her teeth
But I did not feel alone
In the attic, found a ouija beneath
Set of letters and a heart-shaped stone

And she's in the sod
And I live in her house of God

Heart-shaped stone, oh, heart-shaped stone
Sliding across the floor
Lead me to a room I know
Lead me to your door

A clothes peg on his nose.

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away

Still, you made your mark, here in my heart

One day I'll fly away

When will love be through with me?

I'm lying in bed,
Holdin' you close in my dreams;
Thinkin' about all the things that we said
And comin' apart at the seams.
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough;
I know you were tryin'
To give me the best of your love.

Beautiful faces,
Loud empty places
Look at the way that we live,
Wastin' our time
On cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give.

The same old crowd
Was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above,
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love.

Oh, sweet darlin',
You get the best of my love,
(You get the best of my love.)
Oh, sweet darlin',
You get the best of my love.
(You get the best of my love.)

I'm goin' back in time
And it's a sweet dream.
It was a quiet night
And I would be alright
If I could go on sleeping.

But every morning'
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today.
You see it your way,
And I see it mine,
But we both see it slippin' away.

You know, we always had each other, baby.
I guess that wasn't enough.

Like to get your feet up, watch T.V.

So full up, bursting at the seams,
Soon you'll start to nod off, happy dreams.
Wake up, for tea and buttered scones
Such a lot of work for you Sunday Moms.

It's such a crying shame

You worked all week long.
Still, it's quite sad tomorrow's so bad
And I don't feel so strong.

In far-off lands, on distant shores, so many friends to meet.

The Moody Blues,"Since it began I got one dream and it's really my only blessing
If I can come through than so can you
And you will find there's no regretting
Things you want from your life's font
Will never let your spirit roam
Come back to Earth for what it's worth
For you've been dreaming of a ceiling not a home

[Chorus]
I've been doing my best
What else can I do?
Is there something I've missed
That will help you through

I have reached the top of the wall
And all I've found is another way to fall

For some short time
For a while you and I were joined to eternity
Then we split in two back tome and you
Like the rain rising from the sea
Rising from the sea
We all can see what we shall be
But knowing's not really controlling
With time perhaps I will pass the traps and find some peace and understanding
After you'd come and while you're gone
You leave me guessing, it's depressing
Never to know the way to go to find some time along a little less pressing
So you just have to laugh
When it hurts so much
You're so far away and so hard to touch

I have reached the top of the wall
And all I've found is another way to fall

Since it began I got one dream and it's really my only blessing
If I can come through than so can you
And you will find there's no regretting

Will never let your spirit roam

Has made me see our world

How can I tell you, love can change our destiny.

Do what you know is right

Underneath an owl who's thinking

With Jack Rabbit in there thumping
I found that I couldn't sit still
I just had to make it with them
Cause they played my kind of rhythm
And the bees hummed in harmony
And the owl played his oboe

If only we could talk again
Someday, I know I'll see you smiling
When you're a free man again

High on a mountain side
We laughed and talked of things to come
Someway, I know I'll see you shining
When we're all free men again

You left your country for peace of mind
And something tells me you're doin' alright
How are the children and Rosemarie?
I long to see you and be in your company

Someday, I hope I'll see you smiling
When you're a free man again

I often wonder, why
Our world has gone so far astray?
Someway, I know I'll see you shining
When we're all free men again

You gave love freely to those with tears
Your eyes were sad then you saw the need
You know that love lasts for eternity
Let's be God's children and live in perfect peace

Descends the actor who is me.
The sleeping hours take us far,
From traffic, telephones, and fear.
Put out your problems with a cat,
Escape until a bell you hear.
Our reasons are the same,
But there's no one we can blame,
For there's no where we need go,
And the only truth we know, comes so easily.
The sound I have heard in your hello,
Oh darling, you're almost part of me.Oh darling, you're all I'll ever see.
It's such a rainy afternoon,
No point in going anywhere.
The sounds just drift across my room,
I wish this feeling I could share.

Her mind tries to recall his face,
A feeling deep inside her grows.

And the browns, reds and golds of autumn lye in the gutter dead
Remember then the summer birds with wings of fire flame
Come to witness springs new hope, born of leaves decaying
And as new life will come from death

Gives in return a wondrous yearn for promise almost seen

On the threshold of a dream

No thoughts must deceive him

You must come out and see
That your world's spinning 'round
And through life you will be

A small part of a hope
Of a love that exists
In the eyes of a child you will see

Earth falls far away
New life awaits
Time it has no day
New life awaits

Here is your dream
And now how does it feel?
No words will go with you
And now what is real?

You must come out and see
That your world's spinning 'round
And through life you will be

But it's all around if we could but perceive
To know ultra violet, infra-red and X-rays
Beauty to find in so many ways

But to reach the chord is our life's hope
And to name the chord is important to some

The Moody Blues,"When the sun goes down, 
And the clouds all frown, 
Night has begun for the sunset. 
See it with your eyes, 
Earth re-energized 
By the sun's rays every day. 
Take a look out there, 
Planets everywhere. 
When the sun goes down 
And the clouds all frown, 
Night has begun for the sunset. 
Shadows on the ground 
Never make a sound, 
Fading away in the sunset. 
Night has now become 
Day for everyone. 

I can see it all 
From this great height. 
I can feel the sun 
Slipping out of sight 
And the world still goes on 
Through the night.",The Sunset [Live]
The Moody Blues,"Pale the young squire who goes to fight
To die at his master's side
Living is just a dream inside
You ask me why he cried
""What am I doin' here?""
""What am I doin' here?""

Beautiful princess, fair and pale
Stares out across the sea
Alone in her castle dark and grey
Her love she'll never see

""What am I doin' here?""

Tenderly bury the fair young dead
Place a wooden cross at his head

Listen and you may see
Everyone's dream is deep within
Find it and you'll be free

The Moody Blues,"Little guy, little hands, little eyes and lots of time
What you gonna be what you gonna see
When your eyes are level with mine

I'll be level with you
I don't know what I would do
If I had to face the things that you've got coming down the line

Lots of luck, lots of health, lots of wealth, little pain
That's what I want for you but there's little I can do
To put you on the gravy train

I'll be level with you
You'll always end up coming through
But you'll find yourself lost in space now and again

But you have to have a world you can live in
Not a world where all the hope is gone
And as long as we are here together
We must build a home for the free

Filled with pity
Not pain
That's loving and sane
Not divided by hate
And living in spite
'Til it's too late

Life is here
Love will come in the end give it time
There's wonders still to do and I know you'll find it's true
That yours will be bigger than mine

I'll be level with you
The one thing I hope you will do is tell me about what
You're doing from time to time",I'll Be Level With You
The Moody Blues,"Here I go again
Finding it so hard to explain
The way I feel when I hold you near
Still it hurts when you cry

But I guess you need to know

I'm just a man, that's all I am
I'm just a man, that's yours
I'm yours you know I'm yours

I'll look to you please look back at me
See I'm changing every day

You'll see I'm changing every day
In my search for happy days

But then I'm just a man
That's all I am
I'm just a man I'm yours

The Moody Blues,"One step into the light
One step away from night
It's the hardest step you're gonna take
The ship to take you there
Is waiting at the head
Of the stairs that lead up through your opening mind

Above the dark despair
Shines a light that we can share
Close your eyes and look up in between your brows
Then slowly breathing in
Feel the life force streaming in
Hold it there, then send it back to him

All the old things are returning
Cosmic circles ever turning
All the truth we've been yearning for
Life is our saviour, saviour, saviour, save your soul

The river of living breath
Is flowing through the sun
He was there before the earth began
The world will drag on you
Use his love to pull you through
Find the mission of your life and start to be

All the old things are returning
Cosmic circles ever turning
All the truth we've been yearning for
Life is our saviour, saviour, saviour, save your soul

There's one thing I can do
Play my mellotron for you
Try to blow away your city blues
Your dreams are not unfound
Get your feet back on the ground
The truth will set us free, we cannot lose
We cannot love, we just have to choose",One Step into the Light
The Moody Blues,"Shadows of night falling over my head
People walking
Passing me by
Shadows of dreams falling out of the blue
People talking
What can I do
Where do I go from here
Where do I go from here
I could give you any dream and watch it grow
I could take you for a ride but you would know
I could tell you every answer that I know
It wouldn't be much tho'
It wouldn't be anything you didn't know

But
Survival
Nothing more than survival

Shadows of days hanging endless in time
Slowly fading
Passing us by
Shadows of worlds disappearing from view
People asking
What could we do?
Where do I go from here
Where do I go from here

If I gave you every dream they would grow
If I took you for a ride would you know
If I told you every answer that I know
It wouldn't be much tho'

The Moody Blues,"The dawn crept into by room
And stole my dream
Now I'll never know
Just what it means
Or what could have been
Yet still I try to lie
But I'm seen

Under moonshine that's where I've been
Under moonshine I'm clearly seen
Under moonshine that's where I've been
Under moonshine I'm clearly seen

Creator of dreams that melt with the sun
I'll send you the things this man has done
He was a saint and a sinner rolled in one
But I miss now that he's gone
I sure miss him now that he's gone

Sure I feel the pain
Deep inside I pour like rain
Remember when you smile
Love's in your eyes

The world keeps turning
The grass still grows green
The fruit on my tree
Is the biggest you've ever seen
Which way up you know when you're down
They've gotta stand tall
With your feet on the ground
You must stand tall
With your feet on the ground

Or maybe I'm crazy
Also they say I'm lazy
But I'll have my days
When I do as I please
For you won't see the woods
While you're a tree

The Moody Blues,"Just in a simple conversation
You can hear the feeling change
Down to the sea
And if you need an explanation
I defy you to explain
Why I am so nervous
Please explain to me
Why I can't sleep
I close my eyes to shelter
In the dark I try to hide
If you leave me on my own
I'm worried I could lose my way

I see you everywhere
But we don't speak
I try so hard to touch you
But you're always out of reach
If you walked right by
Would I see in it your eye
Would you turn away

To do my turn for you
There's a change I'll slip

But it's so hard to be a jester

The Moody Blues,"Your painted smile hides you still
While you search yourself within
Yesterday and tomorrow's found
Fused as one upon solid ground

Confuse themselves with raging sounds
And their loves forgetfulness abounds
So be thankful for your grease painted clown
If loneliness wears the crown

Shot to pieces
When will I learn

When I didn't see that I was breaking you apart
With angry words of love I didn't mean
Oh why, can't believe that I would ever
Talk myself out of tomorrow
Talked like a fool to yesterday
And as the evening loses colour
Your love began to fade away

And his feet were sore,
And he was tired,
He came upon an orange grove
And he rested.

And he lay in the cool,
And while he rested, 
He took to himself an orange
And tasted it,
And it was good.

And he felt the earth to his spine,
And he asked,
And he saw the tree above him,
And the stars,
And the veins in the leaf,
And the light,
And the balance.

And he saw magnificent perfection,
Whereon he thought of himself in balance,
And he knew he was.

Just open your mind and you will find 
The way it's always been.

For he was not a violent man,
And he thought of those he hurt
For he was not a cruel man
And he thought of those he frightened
For he was not a evil man,

And he understood.
He understood himself.
Upon this
He saw that when he was of anger 
Or knew hurt 
Or felt fear,
It was because he was not understanding.
And he learned, compassion.

And with his eye of compassion
He saw his enemies
Like unto himself,
And he learned love.
Then, he was answered.

The Moody Blues,"Listen hear the sound the child awakes
Wonder all around the child awakes
Now in his life he never must be lost
No thoughts must deceive him in life he must trust

With the eyes of a child, you must come out and see
That your world's spinning 'round and through life you will be
A small part, of a hope, of a love that exists
In the eyes of a child you will see

Earth falls far away new life awaits
Time it has no day, new life awaits
Here is your dream and now how does it feel
No words will go with you and now what is real?

That your world's spinning 'round and through life you will be

So don't stand and stare, stand and stare

Don't let the wind turn you

Once I was rich
Once I was poor
Once I was no-one

Lies in pieces on the ground

Drifting from a distant shore
No goodbyes no celebration
No-one there to close the door
Only the silence that I feel
Only the lonely road is real
If only I didn't loose you
If only we could be
If only we could be

And the things that you said well they left me, left me no choice
And you told me we had the power
And you told me this was the hour
That you don't know how if I could show you now

Well, I dreamed last night you were calling, calling my name
You were locked inside of you secrets calling my name
And you told me lost was the key
And you told me how you long to be free
That you don't know how, oh, let me show you now

Like a bird on a far distant mountain
Like a ship on an uncharted sea
You are lost in the arms that have found you
Don't be afraid, love's plans are made, oh don't be afraid

If there's a time and a place to begin love
It must be now, let it go, set it free

Oh, I dreamed last night I was hearing, hearing your voice
Why did you say those things that have left me, left me no choice?
When you told me we had the power
Why did you tell me now was the hour?

Lost in a lost world
So many people are dying
Lost in a lost world
Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes, it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sounds...
Thinking only of themselves
They shun the light
(Shun the light)
They think they're right
(Think they're right)
Living in their empty shells

Angry people in the street
Telling them they've had their fill
Of politics, people who kill

Grow... the seed of evolution
(So many people, so many people)

It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
Let all our brothers come and get some
(So many people, so many people)

Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again; come on, my friend
Love will find us in the end
Come on, my friend
(On, my friend)
We've got to bend
(Got to bend)
Down on our knees and say a prayer

Oh, can you see the world is pining?

Pining for someone who really cares enough to share his love
With all of us so we can be
An ever-loving family
Have we forgotten who loves who?

That's longer than a centipede

Will it be of comfort
Or the pain of a burning wound?

If we never, never, stop.

You're an ocean full of faces,
And you know that we believe.

Singing all our hopes and dreams.
We look around, in wonder,
At the work that has been done.
By the visions of our father,
Touched by his loving son.

And darker days are drawing near
The winter winds will be much colder

I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear.
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here

Like a song through the trees you came to love me
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way
You always loved this time of year.
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
Cause you're not here

Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

As if to hide a lonely tear

The Moody Blues,"Long time ago
Back in the mist of time
Back when the crystal waters flowed
There was a world
So strange and so beautiful
All life would flourish and would grow

Years went by, time just fell away
Love was worshiped like the sun
But as we arrive at the house
Of the water sign
We're living in strange times

Strange times
Strange times

What do we need?
What do we hunger for?
Who holds the secrets, who will know?
Temples of greed
In ruins on the river bed
Wastelands that lived before the snow

Time stands still
As we race through the universe
On our way to the sun
And as we arrive at the house
Of the water sign
We're living in strange times

Strange times
Strange times

It's you and I forever
We won't be afraid
Even if the stars are falling down
Down, down, down, down
Falling down

Time stands still
As we race through the universe
On our way to the sun
And as we arrive at the house
Of the water sign
We're living in strange times

Strange times, strange times
Strange times, strange times
Strange times, strange times
Strange times, strange times
Strange times, strange times
Strange times, strange times
",Strange Times
The Moody Blues,"These times have passed and gone
It's time that we moved on
Into a new tomorrow
And leave behind the hurt
The sorrow and the pain
'Cause tonight will never
Pass this way again

Wherever you are
Wherever you go
Wherever you stand
Let your shadow show
Whatever you think
Whatever you do
Whatever you want
Let your feelings show

These times have passed and gone
It's time that we moved on
Into a new tomorrow
And leave behind the hurt
The sorrow and the pain
'Cause tonight will never
Pass this way again
'Cause tonight will never
Pass this way again

Just like the winter sun
That hides behind the dawn
Just like the shifting sands
That ride upon the storm

Tonight will never
Pass this way again
'Cause tonight will never
Pass this way again
'Cause tonight will never
Pass this way again
'Cause tonight will never

The Moody Blues,"Words you say to me
I listen in sympathy
But I don't know what it is
That makes me ignore you

I hear you every night
I listen but the words don't seem right
My mind seems somewhere else
What else can I tell you?

I don't know what to do
I'm losing you
Something I can't control
You are in my heart and soul

I don't want to wake up now
I don't want to wake up now
I don't want to wake up now
I don't want to wake up now

Words you say to me
I'm living in fantasy
If I don't know what it is
I simply ignore you

I hear you every night
I listen but the time is never right
My life is so confused
What more can I tell you?

Don't turn and walk away
Don't leave this way

The Moody Blues,"Something you've heard
Somewhere you've seen
Too real to ignore
You've chosen not to believe
From the black of their pain
To the white of their fear
In the dust they die
While eden lies near

The freedom bought,
Changed hands, was sold
This heat of love has turned ice-cold

We just can't escape it
Like flames reaching out from the sun
We can't defeat it
Like flames reaching out from the sun

From the garden of love,
Been banished too long
And the balance will shift
Between the week and the strong
Once they would beg and they would plead
But now they demand
Divided by those that need
And those that command

The freedom bought,
Changed hands, was sold
The heat of love has turned ice-cold and
We never learn but we know too well
Heaven's died and gone to hell

Now you watch but you shoud have run
Like flames that leap from the base of the sun
And you dream you're free but you'll awake

If I were a shepherd
I would bring a lamb
If I were a wise man

The Moody Blues,"The star of Bethlehem was shining
Across a Palestinian sky
The Church of the Nativity was crying
And we all looked on, who can tell me why?

Where are the wise men when they're wanted?
Nowhere to be seen, like thieves in the night
The desert is drifting ever closer
The world won't sleep well tonight

Where did the spirit of Christmas go?
Lost in the desert or covered in snow
Where did the spirit of Christmas go?
If you can find it, please let me know

The shepherds are in the fields sleeping
Waiting for a sign to light up the sky
Heaven is moving ever closer
The promise of a child born on high

Where did the spirit of Christmas go?
Lost in the desert or covered in snow
Where did the spirit of Christmas go?
If you can find it, please let me know

Looking for an answer that escapes me
(Love set me free)
If there is a reason, let me know

Drifting slow through time and space not knowing where we are
How did we ever get this far?

Where did the spirit of Christmas go?
Lost in the desert or covered in snow

The Moody Blues,"A ray of hope flickers in the sky
A tiny spark lights up way up high
All across the land dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born
A silent wish sails the seven seas
The winds of change whisper in the trees
And the walls of doubt crumble, tossed and torn
This comes to pass when a child is born
A rosy hue settles all around
You've got the feel you're on solid ground
For a spell or two, no one seems forlorn
This comes to pass when a child is born

It must come true, sometime soon, somehow

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

Maybe I should close the door
And anyway the snow has covered all your footsteps
And I can follow you no more

The fire still burns at night
The memories are warm and clear
But everybody knows
It's hard to be alone this time of year

It was only a winter's tale
Just another winter's tale
And why should the world take notice
Of one more love that's failed?

A love that can never be
Though it meant a lot to you and me
On a world wide scale
We're just another winter's tale

While I stand alone
A bell is ringing far away
I wonder if you're here
I wonder if you're listening
I wonder where you are today

Good luck, I wish you well
For all that wishes may be worth
I hope that love and strength
Are with you for the length
Of your time on earth

It was only a winter's tale
Just another winter's tale
And why should the world take notice
Of one more love that's failed?

It's a love that can never be
Though it meant a lot to you and me

And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind

Stranded and bored in your room
But you need to feed your eager head
Found out how just a flippin' through
The back pages of a magazine you read, said

""This guitar and a microphone
Is all you need to grow your own""

I get live, gonna blow my speakers and my mind
Turn on and electrify
Gonna blow my speakers and my mind
Kinda feel like a legal high, like a legal high

I get live, gonna blow my speakers and my mind
Turn on and electrify
Gonna blow my speakers and my mind

I get live, gonna blow my speakers and my mind
Turn on and electrify
Gonna blow my speakers and my mind
Kinda feel like a legal high

The Mooney Suzuki,"Oh here I am after all these years
In a little hole in New York City
It's a little room up there
To cover me up by this snow as it falls outside
Out to all sweets of the pavement city
Will I ever feel the cold miles and miles away from home
I hope to get to sleep, stayed up through the night
After seeing half of the Broadway movie
I got up there everyday, a toke of cocaine
And haven't found a snow on Forty Second street
See the thought pretending how they want you
Still I never paid for it miles and miles away from home

[Chorus x2]
Yes it was real, I love New York
Yes it was real, I love New York
Yes it was, it was a real and a lie
Could it ever break you
Could it ever make you in New York
What's the time, as I think of her
Does it make a difference on the other side
She may well be sleeping now
So cover me up with the dreams we share
If we could sleep tonight
In this heated carpet magic city
Could she ever hear me now, calling out

Away from home",New York Girls

Can't tell where he'll wind up

Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May her tender sighs

Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly

Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm, a memory
Through the years
And I still can see blue velvet

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

The Moonlight String Orchestra,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

The Moonlight String Orchestra,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember

At their own grave sides

Singing out of tune
As they sat and sang Auld Lang Syne
By the light of the moon
I heard the preachers banging on the drums
And I heard the police
Playing with their guns
But I, I never heard nothing like you

In the country, where the sky
Touches down on the field
She lay her down to rest
In the morning sun
They come a running just to get a look
Just to feel, to touch her long black hair
They don't give a damn

But, I, I, I never seen nothing like you

Well, I think you know
What I'm trying to say, woman

And every time I've held a rose
It seems I only felt the thorns
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so will you soon I suppose

But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break

And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows

So I would choose to be with you
That's if the choice were mine to make
But you can make decisions too
And you can have this heart to break

And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows",So It Goes

Sometimes I think away these days
The way I spend them hiding
Sometimes I can't lift up my head
Maybe you can find me.
All you need to know,
Look for a light that's shining
All we see now

We see a fire starting.
I swear I dream of waking up
To find the future screaming
But I've been sleepwalking so much
I don't remember dreaming
All we need to know
Look for a light that's shining
All we see now
We see a fire starting
We all look bright here
Underneath the sun
The same clean light, in the same love

We'll all be here if the end is coming up
The same clean light, in the same love
So when you crawl into your head
What do you think you're missing?
I will lift you up again
I will always listen
All we need to know
Look for a light that's shining
All we see now

We see a fire starting
We all look bright here underneath the sun
The same clean light, in the same love
We'll all be here if the end is coming up
The same clean light in the same love
I hope you know that love is good enough
What doesn't change will slip and fall away
I hope you know you're loved
And that's enough
What doesn't change
Doesn't matter anyway
We are underneath the sun in the same love",Clean Light

These so called vacations won't soon be my death
I'm so sick of the drink, I need home for a rest

Easton station the train journeyed north 
And in the buffet car we lurched back and forth
Passed odd crooked dykes and through Yorkshire's green field 
We where flung into dance as the train jigged and reeled

[Chorus]

By the light of the moon she'd drift through the streets
A rare old perfume so seductive and sweet
She teased us and flirt as the pubs all closed down
Then walk us on home and deny us a round

[Chorus]

The gas heater's empty, it's damp as a tomb
And the spirits we drank are now ghosts in the room
I'm knackered again, come on sleep take me soon
And don't lift up my head till the twelve bells of noon

[Chorus]",Home for a Rest

I feel your eyes on me
But I can't see you

You understand I'm not afraid
Of your complete devotion now
But if it ever gets out of hand
I'll bring you down

Everywhere I go you're there
Everywhere I go you're there
Everywhere I go you're there
Can't you see you're driving me insane?

I'm not advertising
Or am I criticizing
But if I had a choice
You'd leave me alone

It's not that I've done wrong
I never think I'm wrong
But when you're watching me
I feel so guilty

It's not the way I thought it'd be
The lack of all my privacy
And if it ever gets out of hand
I'll bring you down

He must be so sad
He goes to extremes to convince us he's bad
He's really a victim of fear and of pride
Look close and there must be a sweet man inside

There goes Mr. Outrage
There goes Mr. Sneer
He has no time for friends or fun
His anger makes that clear
Don't ask him for a favor 'cause his nastiness increases
No crust of bread for those in need
No cheeses for us meeses

There goes Mr. Heartless
There goes Mr. Cruel

He lets this hunger rule

Now there only pictures in my head
That's why my green is feeling grey
Sometimes even frogs have rainy days

Remember when the stage caved in
While you were rocking out
Who'd of thought your smorkus board
Would be hard to live without

If we could do it all again
Just another chance to entertain
Would anybody watch or even care
Or did something break we cant repair

Your canon ball tragetory
It always gave me hope
They may have been unbearable but
I still loved your jokes

Is there more I could've said

I didn't do it I've been framed aah wacka wacka

And what's on the other side
Rainbows are visions
But only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide

So we've been told

I know they're wrong, wait and see
Some day we'll find it

The lovers, the dreamers, and me

Who said that every wish
Would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star
Somebody thought of that
And someone believed it
And look what it's done so far

What's so amazing
That keeps us stargazing
And what do we think we might see
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

All of us under its spell, we know that it's probably magic

Have you been half asleep?
And have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound
That called the young sailors?
The voice might be one in the same

I've heard it too many times to ignore it

Murder came with it

Hangin out late
Nicknamed the milk-crate
But on a bad note came jail time and jam nines
Can you feel the rhyme, feel a thug trying to shine
On the grind, you better keep your ass in line
'cause from the get-get-go nigga, say it ain't so nigga
You was watchin me through your window nigga
Doing crimes, selling twenties for dimes
Middle finger in the air screamin fuck one time
As you peep out, don't got the balls to speak out
Scary reach out, scream murder and pull the glock out
Cock it back, then tell your crew to relax
Take a deep breath, now take six to the chest
Ten to the neck, just incase you wearin a vest
And that's the whole sixteen coppin in safeen

Bet I'm holdin a fifth and a full clip
At any given moment to flip on some bullshit
Spit it sick, flowin like alien
And I'm way beyond flashin

I mastered the game, accurate aim
Put two in you
Slappin your dame, jump back in the Range

Let it rip, reload, and spit a hundred more
Give you a reason to run, oh, you gung-ho
I hope y'all niggaz really ready 'cause my steel is heavy
And feel no petty for those stuffed in a box
Nigga peep it and watch, how the sun glisten on rocks

But now I'm on some click-clack 
Keep your eyes on the cash, gimme that
Where they at, y'all niggaz want it
We right here, let me make myself clear
Nigga we can't be touched
The fuck y'all want

From rob men that rob grown men
And be the one hustlin til the one come in
The worst niggaz cock back, and spit for gin
Til the day we win niggaz is gonna fall from wood hall

The streets ain't the same no more
Niggaz came to keep the roar but ??? on the floor
Let's explore, whoevers quick on the draw is the law
The fuck you set these rules for
It's the streets
My code is the heat plus we all gotta eat
Take a seat, and watch the streets get runned by thugs
Now stand up, and watch my hustlin niggaz rush the club
Automatic love, fingerprints, clubs be	, 38 snubb

My slugs will be your homeys 
Pop the glock and make you know me

Gettin cream in Jamaica Queens

Come clean, if not, you gots to get shot
Give me the ooh-op, and let me hold down the block
Fuck cops, I pump crack rocks on back blocks
Lace shots, at them snitch niggaz, snap box
Black Child couldn't go play with the children
'Cause I was too buisy pumpin up them jums in the buildin
While most kids went to school to maintain
I was in the spot cookin up cocaine
The game got me, at eighteen I got sloppy
Caught a body and shot up his house party
Time to relocate, I better transport my weight
Pick up all my papes and bounce out of state
Catch me in Virginia I ain't gonna never surrender
Unless I'm dead or injured and that's somethin to rememeber nigga

Yo it ain't nuthin but murder one
Niggaz holdin they guns and bustin em
My niggaz foul son we spray up the block
And leave bystanders numb and braindumb
Niggaz heard the shots but where they commin from
I squeezed off and hit his bitch up, my aim's off
But fuck it, nigga rob the block for twelve hundred
So I came off, if it's murder you want it's murder I give
Makin it harder for niggaz to live for you and your kids
No question, murder perfection dog
I'm runnin through you and into the Lord I never prayed for
God knows I'm layin for him bustin at the sky

That probly why niggas get killed so often
Nothin' to live for type a nigga I did a bid for
Snitch bitch niggas that ain't built for war
Is it because we ain't got no love for thugs
And slugs for drugs, the worlds most murda'rous

Put two in you, then puff a blunt at your funeral
I might touch yo' click and fuck yo' bitch

Four shit on the sawed off, blowin' the doors off the Range Rov' shit

And my murdera's I lie and fry for
Murda man, when the shit hit the fan
The plan formulate, for instance, fuck a percentage you need the all the cake
Put the four to snakes make 'em lay for raw
Fuck the game, 'cause nigga I don't play no more
Size 'em up, nevermind if you ridin' tough
Count 'em out 'til his eyes is puff, despising us
I got hungry thugs that'll tie you up
And they ain't got a problem with, snub nose revolver shit
We hard to hit, my mom's a Crip
We thristy niggas that'll rob ya bitch for the love of the chips

Gotta stash where the heats placed in, paper I keep chasin'

Stop at the Stome, leave the keys in it
Gave you to leave with it, Bing will make you believe in it

Live for life, its murda for life nigga
We different, you can call us the Murdera's
We different, you don't want to fuck with us
We different, how we see the souls through the eyes
Live for life, its murda for life nigga

My nigga silence is the code for killers, we let the chrome speak
And touch whoeva, 'cause no niggas beyond reach
We the drum heat, y'all niggas will fall faster
Spitting like nine raptors, crush 'em like linebackers
Nigga, this shit is a joke?  You die and ??? the laughter
And that's for, whoever intervene or stoppin' the green in it
For the longevity, check the pedigree 
So if I feel you ahead of me, tomorrow you'll neva see
We murderers with money to get, honies to hit
Rugars and dummies to spit, leavin you mummy to stiff
I'm one that'll flip, breakin the law chasin the raw
Beat you with the barrel of the gun, breakin ya jaw
Takin it all, fuck leavin the crumbs for niggas
Slum jones for niggas, now I strap up and come for niggas
And when I'm done with niggas they rest on they death bed
With the doctor pullin lead outta they head
I'll die for the bread

[Chorus]

I  don't really give a fuck about y'all niggas
I'll sabotage with niggas, 'cause niggas actin like bitches
Causing me to start shittin, I'm the Murderer
Who the fuck you thought you was?
Little man shut the fuck up, respect the boss
You gotta be kidding me, nigga you a kid to me
Suckin my dick when I was with the Click in nine-three
Get'cha own identity, you fuckin dick ridah
A year ago, nigga you was a b-boy for lifah
Stay frontin, when all eyes on the Jeeps
The only nigga I see puching somethin is me
I should be sunnin' y'all niggas for y'all cut
Fuckin on y'all sluts, but cha'll niggas ain't worth that much
You should be glad I'm shittin and shed light to the fact
If you shit back then maybe y'all niggas might go plat
I'm the pinnacle of that, young, stressed, and black
Think it out with the mind with the heart, attack
In the soul I tend to get attached, these the things that
Make me different, undeniably gifted
Its scripted that I'ma kill 'em all from the heart
The world's most dangerous, race against time, and march
Y'all niggas want to start the war right now
I hit 'em up and tear 'em right to the ground
Its the Murdera's, nigga you want it with us?
What the fucks up?  What the fucks up nigga?

[Chorus]",We Different
The Murderers,"Yo, throw your motherfuckin' middle fingers in the air, nigga
'Cause if y'all don't give a fuck, like we don't give a fuck
Throw your motherfuckin' fingers in the air

Motherfucker, the war is on, we're gonna pour it on
Niggas to be feminine, guns rapidly scenative
For the love of the Benjamins
Keep 'em leekin' an' bleekin' to dogs with his broads tremblin'
I'm sendin' him 'til the Lord, calls my adrenalin

You slow mo, niggas gettin' slow dough
Fuck your po'-po', I let the flow blow
Keep em' runnin' like Flo Jo, I flow so
Sickest murder, clip inserter, drop, pop an' rip your word up

We lust for more, can't touch crush the rope
Hit a club, then rush the door, niggas fuck the known
That's why we've been blazed, to you, froze it up
Had your name to the crease so you closed it up

I'm one in a mil, niggas got me gunnin' for real
Leavin' you nothin' to steal, so no pain to feel
So fuck the world, ya either get when you see the sink skin
No more than my thugs than your guns let off

I earned connections, every time I burn my weapon
Y'all niggas gonna learn your lesson
Fuck the Feds, nigga, we spit hollow heads
Our motto is 'Shed blood for dead thug'

That shed blood in hell, when my slugs set bail
Pray for death from your cell, I won't bet we got to jail
From pretty niggas with half a nickel flow
Them bitch niggas, they keep their dimes on the low

Y'all niggas is lame, commercial niggas, get out the game
We here now, shit's gonna change
We spit them things from point blank range at you
Then ask what the fuck you gon' do

Test the mic on your gun, lose your life an' your ones
I don't give a fuck where you from, niggas run when we come
I bust my gun 'cause I'm a bum from the gutter
You better know it's murda, motherfucker

Y'all ain't hear me, y'all with me
Throw your fuckin' fingers up, motherfucker
'Cause if y'all don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Throw your motherfuckin' fingers in the air

Nigga, I'm livin' my life, fuckin' your wife
Bendin' her up while I'm hollerin', “I don't give a fuck”
So I move like like it such and y'all can't get enough
Of The Murderers, it'll murda y'all, nigga, what, what?

I know y'all are ready to die, know why?
'Cause the pain is too much to bare while alive
So I cock my nine then close my eyes
Take another hit an' then creep an' blow minds

These are hard times, niggas, in these streets an' bust blind
Out of fear, out of despair but never in the air
We gonna take to this, point blank range in your Range Rov'
Pistol with the kids an' rape your stray hoe

We The Murderers, yo, what you expect from us?
We niggas you can't trust, that don't really give a fuck
We dedicated to street life, game an' hustle
I don't wanna be white, let them black an' live for struggle

My niggas tote guns for hittin' you an' your squad up
Now we got the upper hand, so keep your palms up
Niggas, if you want it with Ja, come in an' line up
Guaranteed you be meetin' your Maker, your times' up

Negative, I can go into the streets we live
Paper, foreign niggas be murderin' shit
So what, what? Niggas is holla, “Yo, what up?”
Murda Inc. is the movement that won't be touched

Motherfuckers, ya hear me? Murder Inc., niggas
'Cause if you don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Throw your motherfuckin' fingers in the air

We don't give a what, what?
All of my ladies, it's all gravy
Get your tubs up, it's murder, turn it up
Plus, ain't nobody hotter than Totti, so who you ridin' with?
Ladies hatin' blatantly hatin''cause they ain't hidin'

Dismiss hot chick, straight to the top chick
That'll chase you, that'll strip you
Off your crown an' replace you
When I stay laced, boo, in the top of the line
In the finest designers, from Fendi an' Gabbana

Players, if you want it, I got it, just come an' get it
Thugs, if you hustlin', hustlin', come an' get it
Mommy, if you rollin' with Totti, let's get this dough off
We don't give a fuck, what?

And the niggas that I once bought from, buy from me
All sales, retail, Fish scales, Ivory
I'm trying to see if I could build a fortress underground
So when Feds come in lurkin, I'm nowhere to be found
I'm the type to take a brick, bust it down
into dimes and nicks, find some strips and flood the town
If I ever hit the ground, I'm just clickin and cockin
And run up into your spot, and get to poppin instead of shoppin

So when the profit is lost, fuck splittin it

The Murderers,"And now, the tale from the darkside... 
Uh, I got to remind y'all niggas 
What the flow is all about 
Huh, its about this 
Anywhere from forty-eight and up 
Straight, you feel me? 
Fifty fifty 

Aiyyo, I gots to hear the beat so I can eat, ahight? 
If I can't live, you can't live, ain't nothin sweet 
Bitch ass niggas think its all about Versace 
A week later them niggas talkin about (Yo, X got me) 
I thought he was my man, but he act like he ain't know me 
I knew he had the joint, but I didn't want to make him show me 
That nigga be buggin, stickin cats up and random 
Doing his dirt and disappearin like the phantom 
Niggas can't stand him, but ask me if I care 
'Cuz what I used to give a fuck about, just ain't there 
And ain't nothing fair, I knew this for a long time 
that's why with ever wrong crime comes anotha strong rhyme 
And that's mo' time under the belt, you felt what I had 
And I shouldn't have even done it, that's what made this shit sad 
I'm doin' bad, but if I gots to feel it, you gots to feel it 
And if a nigga can't afford it, I gots to steal it 
And that's how real it, GETS, when this shit [hits the fan] 
You still tryin to get the man, first catch up with the man 
Then we gon' see what'choo made of 
If your shit ain't pumpin cool-Aid, what you afraid of? 
The monster under the bed, fill ya with four slugs to the head 
Or ya babies mother missin for a month, found dead 
Worms comin' from places you stuck ya dick in 
Maggots got the bitch coverered and the smells sick'nen 
Plastic don't hide the smell for too long, I do wrong 
And so I don't have nightmares I forget about it, move on 
Keep gettin my groove on, 'cuz that shit could fuck with'choo 
Keep dwellin on it, and its gonna get stuck with you 
Niggas try their luck with you, 'cuz they smell ass 
And money if you pussy, I'm gonna be able to tell fast 
Some cop I'm about to smack across the face in this robbery 
I'm on a robbin spree, and ain't no STOPPIN ME 
On this real, that's why a nigga stay writin 
'Cuz kid this shit is real, what you think we play fightin 
You must of saw som'thin funny, or never saw som'thin bloody 
Or you don't know I'll bring it to your door 'cuz I'm cruddy 
Like puddy, when I hold you niggas, I mold you niggas 
I done told you niggas, that I been owed you niggas 
For that shit you did that you wasn't built for 
Shit I guess you didn't know you do get killed for 
I done filled niggas up with the extended clip 
Its like I blew this joint down with the extended rip 
Or that non-stop, when the bomb drops 
I'ma take it from where you at and then end up on ya moms block 
From here to Comstock, niggas gettin bust wild 
?Cell cagers last night from lock out just died? 
Ain't no where to hide, ain't no wear to run 
What more can they do to a man that ain't been done 
A mind is a terrible thing to waste 
Especially if its all over the place, your mind all over his face 
How do brains taste, when they mixed with gun powder 
Semi to fully automatic makes the gun louder 
I got som'thin to fix pain when I kicks game 
'Cuz I'ma float off more tracks than they sixth train 
You 'bout to get flamed, from ash to ashes to DIRT 
You gon' go with the dough that your life was worth

The Muses,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

The Nashville All-Stars,"Well, I got my first truck when I was three
Drove a hundred thousand miles on my knees
I hauled marbles and rocks and thought twice before
I hauled a Barbie doll bed for the girl next door
She tried to pay me with a kiss and I began to understand
There's something women like about a pickup man

When I turned sixteen I saved a few hundred bucks
My first car was a pickup truck
I was cruisin' the town and the first girl I see
Is Bobbie Joe Gentry, the homecoming queen
She flagged me down and climbed up in the cab
And said ""I never knew you were a pickup man!""

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe de Ville
I've got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

In the bed of my truck on an old chaisse lounge
Backed into my spot at the drive-in show
You know a cargo light gives off a romantic glow
I never have to wait in line at the popcorn stand
Cuz there's something women like about a pickup man

I rolled and I took my chances

One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills, boys, I'll never roam

The Nashville Guitars,"Well, I've spent a lifetime lookin' for you;
singles bars and good time lovers were never true.
Playin' a fools game hopin' to win; 
and tellin' those sweet lies  and losin' again.
 
I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces
of what I'm dreamin' of.
 
Hopin' to find a friend and a lover;
I'll bless the day I discover 
another heart lookin' for love.
 
And I was alone then, no love in sight;
and I did ev'rything I could to get me though the night.
Don't know where it started or where it might end;
I turned to a stranger just like a friend.
 
I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces
of what I'm dreamin' of.
 
Hopin' to find a friend and a lover;
I'll bless the day I discover 
another heart lookin' for love.
 
Then you came a knockin' at my heart's door;
You're ev'ry thing  I've been lookin' for. 
 
No more lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces
of what I'm dreamin' of.
 
Now that I've found a friend and a lover;
I bless the day that I discovered 
you, oh you; 
 
lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces
of what I'm dreamin' of.
 
Now that I've found a friend and a lover;
I bless the day that I discovered

of what I'm dreamin' of.

The Nashville Session Singers,"Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside there was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain every beat of my heart
We got something going on

Tender love is blind it requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream that is what we are
No one in between how can we be wrong?
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

I can't live without you if the love is gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear this could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

The sight of you among the sites
I get this sudden sinking feeling
Of a man about to fly
Never kept me up before
Now I've been awake for days
I can't fight it anymore
I'm going through an awkward phase
I am secretly in love with
Everyone that I grew up with
Do my crying underwater
I can't get down any farther
All my drowning friends can see
Now there is no running from it
It's become the crux of me
I wish that I could rise above it

But I stay down
With my demons
I stay down
With my demons

Passing buzzards in the sky
Alligators in the sewers
I don't even wonder why
Hide among the under views
Huddle with them all night long
The worried talk to god goes on
I sincerely tried to love it
Wish that I could rise above it

But I stay down
With my demons
I stay down
With my demons
I stay down
With my demons
I stay down

Can I stay here? I can sleep
On the floor
Paint the blood and hang the palms
On the door
Do not think I'm going places anymore
Wanna see the sun come up above New York
Oh, everyday I start so great
Then the sunlight dims
Less I've learned
The more I see the pythons and the limbs
Do not know what's wrong with me
Sours in the cup
When I walk into a room
I do not light it up

The Nazz,"If that's the way you feel, don't change your mind
Be sure this time, I don't really mind
If that's the way you feel, let this be gone
Decide it on what you really want
I'm not going to plead so that no one is stopping you
Write when you get to where ever you're going to
I might have gone but I'm too much involved
To forget all my problems and think of them solved
I'm not in the habit of running my fears up a flagpole
And I'm less concerned of your secrets
than about why you carry on so
If you want a little bit of attention
Why not make a spectacle of your self in public
Or maybe you could credit me with having
Enough understanding to merit a wire
Besides this is the end
And goodbye, it was real
But then

The Nazz,"I was thinking 'bout my troubles this morning
 Trying to decide if I should live or die
 I forgot to leave a note on the mailbox so
 Said I hope that you forget to come by
 I'd wasted time to tell myself
 It's wrong to leave you by yourself
 The love I have does not exceed
 The fear I have of you when you need someone to plead
 With you to try again
 And beg you not to cry in vain and be your friend
 Why is it me? Why is it me? Why is it me now?

 I was never meant to carry the burden
 Keeping track of someone else's life as my own
 How can I enjoy the time when I'm with you when
 I'm afraid to ever leave you alone
 I wish you'd stop this game or else
 Begin to lean on someone else
 I'd like to leave you far behind
 Before I'm found in your state of mind
 Because I need to lead a life of my own
 I wish you'd find somebody else and leave me alone
 Why bother me? Why bother me? Why bother me now?",Lemming Song

Made me quite a little scared
Luckily I found that in the new world

Somebody's gonna be lost in your mind

There's a line I don't want to have to follow behind
And I just can't see myself hugging you, loving you
There is only one winner
You're the one to decide
You've got to tell me who is the winner
Tell me who gets the broken heart, who gets the bride
Not a thing I can do - it depends upon you
But nobody wants to win more than I do

I can't lie, and I'll do anything to show you my side
I won't lie, no lie
I'll do anything to bring you over to my side
Take your time, take your time
If you want all my time is yours
Time is yours to make me the winner","Only One Winner, Pt. 2"
The Nazz,"I know you think I've done something wrong
I'm only trying to see myself through your eyes
And put myself where I belong
You think I'm hurting, I can't make you see
I can't love you when the person you love isn't me

I can't stop feeling, my heart still feels like before
How can I tell you to make you see what I mean
I couldn't mean it anymore
If I could see you I'd try to explain
You're my heart's life, it can't take the pain
I'm alive - keep me alive

I'm not the guy that you think I'll turn out to be
You knew somebody with love too easy to say
But girl you know that isn't me
It's not that easy to say I'm in love
'til it's something we both are sure of
If you want me to say I'm in love
Make it something we both are sure of",It's Not That Easy [No Strings and Todd's Vocals]
The Nazz,"Kiddie boy, kiddie boy, don't kid around with me
Don't do nothing with my woman,
you wouldn't want me to see
Kiddie boy, kiddie boy, I knew your papa too
He'd come around my house, someone my mama knew
Kiddie boy, kiddie boy, I'm gonna have my day
It seems you don't like living,
you're gonna get your way
","Kiddie Boy [No Horns, Demo Version, Different Mix, Todd's Voca]"
