Shades Apart,"Frozen talk won't stop for sure 
What's buried in the ground 
A limit for tomorrow 
Doesn't save the here and now 
It shouldn't be hard to agree 
On something they must know 
Maybe they are thinking 
If we give in we will fall 

Falls the snow
If we give in we will fall
Falls the snow 
So far to go 

The only thing I really fear
Is what I can't control 
This fear has grown a part of me 
I've lived it for so long 
What good is it to protest 
It's like screaming at the wall
Still we raise our voices 
If we give in we will fall 

I can't live my life here underground 
And stare at concrete walls 
Nothing's safe to touch outside 
I'm scared of what I'll find 
I spend my time back in the past 
All I have are photographs 
Visions of a troubled world 
That didn't know how good we had it all",Cold War
Shades Apart,"Is this what you've been waiting for 
You know you're gonna change the world 
You get to be invisible 
Now you're not ready for life 
You're not ready to die 

Things are so much different now that you've come of age 
Look straight and hard and far ahead for something you can save 
Things are so much different now that you've come of age 
Walk right into your destiny decisions have been made

It always seemed much later on 
The time has come you're on your own 
This is the dream it's coming true 
Too fast desire can't help you 

This is what you've been hoping for 
You know you'll never change the world 
You think you're so invincible now 
You don't know the truth, you can't live the lies",Come of Age
Shades Apart,"I didn't know it could get so dark so fast
But from here on its not gonna last
The days are getting longer and I'll have my time 

Tomorrow is not far away
From where I stand all alone today
Just add another minute for the sun to shine

My shadow falls hard against this world
It leads me to a special place
It looks away from the shortest day
But it stares right back in my face 
The sun at my back gives me a long look 
And it won't fail me now
I'm walking straight to a warm embrace 
To a day that's never gonna end at all 

Don't you feel the chill lift from the air
The sky shines clear to someplace where
There will be no more waiting for the night to end

I didn't know I could get so far so fast
Overcome my shadow and walked right past 
Straight into the sunlight
'Cause I know my own way now 
I know the darkness will return 
The numbing cold and the freezing burn 
The days are getting shorter 
But I know that I will last",Dark Days
Shades Apart,"Promise 
Welcome to a world of promise 
These smiling faces are your friends 
All this happiness is certain 
Unless of course you don't fit in 

Fall in line 
Pretend like you don't mind 
Get in the know unless you've had enough time to get dangerous 

Laughing 
Why are all these dudes so happy 
Our hero questions the big joke 
Stop it make them all just disappear 
He's never felt so all alone 
Now's the time 
There's not need to hide 
He's got to let them know 
Look's like he's had enough 
He's getting dangerous 
I wonder who's laughing now",Dude Danger
Shades Apart,"You reach out to pat my back
But twist the knife instead
I can't touch your private world 
Or illusions of your mind

Season of unearthly need
Reading further down 
Time is lost and you're the same 
You're acting without thought now 

Who will you run to 
When heaven falls 

Here we stand now back to back
We're choking just to speak
I can't touch your private world 
Or illusions of your mind now 

Losing grip of fading thought 
What difference did it make 
Loosing touch of what you had 
When time left you behind",Heaven Falls
Shades Apart,"Push forward 
Lay to rest old fears 
Not long ago I was one of them
I'm changing 
The more I've changed 
The harder it is to face what I was before 

It's one man against one man 
I'm gonna take a stand 
Older now 

Stand silent 
The pain is there 
The fear burns in my eyes 
I won't look back 
There's nothing left to hide 
I'm different but I don't need it written on my face 
The real difference is inside 

One man against one man 
I gotta take a chance 

No pity 
No regret for what I left behind
Yesterday is dead 
I am still alive 
It's clear now 
What I fought so hard 
I fought against myself
I'm not ashamed of what I am",Older Now
Shades Apart,"Sunburned faces watch a nuclear sky
Initial conflict on the fourth of July
Children hide their heads and wonder why
No one really cares

Crying on the Inside
Surrender

Radio brings in the daily news
The sky's a crisscross of those red whites and blues
If the day should come what would you choose
If the day should ever come now would you really care",On the Inside
Shades Apart,"Reaching through the pain the real world sent your way 
Problems you can't understand but still you have to fight 
It makes me proud inside to see you try so hard 
It hurts to watch your struggle 
I can't tell you I know I'm right 

No, I won't cry for you 
What you need is a place to turn 
And I hope that you will fall on me 
'Cause I won't fall 

Some people don't catch on they'd rather just pretend 
While things are going smooth they smile and call you friend 
Funny how you never know who cares until it hurts 
And when it's over does it matter who blew who off first 

No, I won't cry for you 
You need someone to turn to 
And I hope that you will fall on me 
'Cause I won't fall 

Remember when you lost your head 
Your mind screams for what you should have said 
Face the world with a painful smile 
Holding back the guilt inside 
You never thought you'd do such harm
You'll never forget or hide these scars 
Hurting inside's no way to grow
So just let go 
Cause it's gone with yesterday 

I know the things you're going through are hard to take 
Trying to be what you never wanted find a real way to be brave
I've learned to understand you'll get by on your own 
You've got yourself to count on now but realize your not alone 

No I won't cry for you 
Don't need weak sympathy 
What you need you will find 
Just open your fist and reach to me",Remember When
Shades Apart,"I can't complain 
about this rut I'm in 
day after day 
these same walls I kick in 
rip out my hair 
what's so unfair 

bent out of shape 
underestimate what I can take 
it's easier to just break down 
when you're not around anymore 

woe is me, 
I just can't win 
the cable's out again 
can't stand the neighbor's hollering' 

it comes crashing down and I forget 
that some hearts never mend 
and it never ends 
even though I'm not pretending when I cry 

I don't care 
about this rut I'm in 
no show to steal 
by making a big deal if I fall down and what for 

fall so hard to seal my fate 
feel's so good to bellyache 
it's gonna be one of those days 
break it down",Rut
Shades Apart,"How do you see yourself
Do you find yourself within 
You look for now way out
Can't you be yourself
Separated form all them 
You're seeing now way else 
How to be yourself
Don't you find the strength within

Living in the shadow of a cross
See there's no real reason to be lost 
Or found in someone else
I'm not sorry now 

Are you really sure 
What you're searching for to see 
Or will you even understand 
What are you waiting for
'Cause there's so much more to be 
And not try so hard to hide 
The light you're reaching to 
Could be burning bright in you

It's an easy choice 
Once you're living at the end 
Does it matter either way
It's not such a crucial choice 
Just let your heroes die, be them 
Doesn't matter either way
Destroy with your own voice 
Just don't pretend to know its' the right choice",Shadow of a Cross
Shades Apart,"The rain taps on the window down the hall 
there's no one out there nothing at all 
reaching out strange lightning from above 
looking up nothing to be scared of 

take away the wonder 
take away the world 
you better not forget 

it's quiet now the wind begins to slow 
someone's standing there please don't go 
forever new and still the same 
you can help things stay this way 
all clear now how fast it came and went 
someone's standing there don't let it end",Strange Lightning
Shades Apart,"Voices sometimes mine 
Whispers in my mind 
I can't be alone 
No way to compensate 
For an insane world 
Is this what i've outgrown 

I fell it it's all there 
I can't ignore the signs 
It's not my fault 
If someone gets hurt the next time worlds collide 

Where the madness ends 
Imagination begins 
It's getting closer all the time 
Fury in my eyes 
I'm not repentant for my crimes 
Not this time 

Is it hate or fear 
Rorschach I can't decide 
I fear my hate 
I don't know how to love everyone",Surface Tension
Shades Apart,"A grim reality there's something on the TV news
We're faced with truth we can't refuse no outcome left to choose
Nothing's ever new again
A Grim reality

We believe
Don't understand

A bitter fallacy there's murder in McDonald land
Watching from the living room or shouting from the stands
Don't just stand there waiting for the change again 
What's it gonna be

Don't you see
There's nowhere to hide from me

Land of make believe there's something wrong in TV land
The outside world comes crashing in and nothing goes as planned
Don't just stand there waiting for the change again",We Believe
Shades Apart,"When the sun is almost out of view
I see the old man climbing to his roof
Leans against the sky into the painted distance
Tries to hear it every night 
He wants to make it right

Calling out of somewhere
Voices in the shadows
Calling out of someplace
Moving one by one

Says he had sons, all about my age
Can't remember more the pictures fade
Blink and years go by the days go on forever
Shines the medals every day
He doesn't miss a day

Under indigo and charcoal skies
He listens when the traffic rattle dies
On the jetstream signals at the edge of silence
More than half a world away
Is not so far away",Calling
Shades Apart,"This
Side of truth
Unlearned in my youth

Lines
Edges on the air
Too much everywhere

Tear it away
I'm not sorry

Spin
Spinning circle game
Every word the same

Rage
Scream across the sky
Rage against the dying light

Overdriving
Black lie smiling
You won't grind me",Comet
Shades Apart,"She holds too tight
Underwater life
And paralyzed
Her own mind
Gets in the way
Every time

I don't want to be dead and gone before I'm gone

She starts to shake
Covers up her face
Because it's all fake
All design
What can it take
To realize

Awake at night
Nothing fits right
Shut inside
Dreams a life
Doesn't make sense at all
In the world outside",Dead Before I'm Gone
Shades Apart,"Picture out the window is razor sharp
Horizontal lines stretch out so far
Reach out for a hand in the dark

Watching all the colors drifting by
Look forever down that mountainside
Feel the cool air rise off the ground

I decide what is right or wrong
I decide what can pass or fail
I rely on my good luck charm

Stepping over oceans
Walk across the sky
Universe is shrinking
Down to size
Try to dissolve into space

No one is deceitful
Nothing untrue
Ignoring what is certain
Believe a lie
Conscience can escape from inside

Imaginary friends are stopping by
Talking aspirations of past lives
Faces seem familiar and kind",Good Luck Charm
Shades Apart,"She don't know where I came from
I'm feeling like I'm half-alive
She don't know and I don't care
Two of us are scared to laugh

What a waste of Saturday
My eyes shut tight
I lie awake all night

We both know the flashing lights
The neon flicker and buzz
We both know the night's swirling blurs
I just can't place the face",Neon
Shades Apart,"Clock ticks
Memory slips
Call it bliss
Curl your lips into a smile

Ignition
Let's take a ride to see the fireworks
Exploding
Don't turn the lights off yet I'm fighting sleep

Wake up my senses
Open the curtain on my mind
I know I still believe in you

Phone rings
It's Valerie
Seeing
Can you come to a birthday party

Free falling
Small talk can get so small some times
Recalling
My favorite episode with out looking up

Ecstatic
The static rocks the radio
God Dammit
Automatically I stare into your eyes",The Tilt
Shades Apart,"I guess you 're wondering why I brought you here
It seemed like such a good idea at the time
I was thinking you would sort things out
If I could just explain away the consequences

Please meet me on neutral ground
It's not fair to me when you smile
Promise you won't see through me
A promise of time

Sorry that the place is such a mess
Things all piled up at once I guess
How can you look at me like I'm insane
All I want to give you is some understanding",Visitor
Shades Apart,"I was alone and frightened
Until you came along
I was afraid of everyone
You showed me I was wrong
You came into my life
And helped me take a stand
I feel so whole inside now
Come and take my hand
You belong to me
You can never leave
I'll show you off to my friends
You see they're so impressed
Together we must look so cool
I bet they never guessed
That I could be someone
And with you by my side
Anyone who disrespects
Has got no place to hide
Favorite toy
I am happy now
I know you're happy, too
Every guy around my neighborhood
Wishes he had you
Nobody stare at me
Don't they know who I am?
We'll take that smile right off his face
We'll take his life for fun",Gun
Shades Apart,"I want to lie to you
All you can do is listen
My smile is blinding you
You'll never find out the truth
You don't know which side I'm on
The whole world can take me on
A menace just can't turn and walk away
Spilling my guts to you
I'll break your heart in pieces
I'm just misunderstood
That's what I'll have you believe
I don't know which side I'm on
Menace to society
You can't make me turn the other way
I wouldn't be surprised
If one day I broke my cover
Don't be afraid of me 
It's only when I'm with my friends",Menace
Shades Apart,"Chasing after monsters
You become one, too
When you're staring into nothingness
It's looking back at you
Nothing's ever easy
Does it come with time?
There's a voice of question in your head
Always asking why
Now - Worn out, worn thin
Worn down without a doubt
One end, one dream
No matter what it means
Searching every shadow
Tracing every sign
Truth is so immense how can it hide?
What is there to find?
I go on chasing monsters
I go on wasting time
The hint of what could be just won't let go
See the spirit shine",Monster
Shades Apart,"It was yesterday when you stopped by
And you looked as if you had no cares at all
But behind those eyes
And a fragile smile
You said good-bye
Nothing's real anyway
When people move so fast
You're standing back
You can't pretend
You're part of the scene
You're just caving in
And you don't know why
You never try
Someone tried to call
But you let it ring
It's an invasion
You don't know why
They care about you
The world keeps
Creeping in
You want to hold it back
It's following you
Nothing's real anymore
And you like it that way
It's not giving up
It's just a means of escape
You're just wasting away
And you don't know why
You didn't try
Now the day is done
Without a sound
And when tomorrow comes
You can't remember a thing
You just disappear
And you wonder why it happened to you",Nothing's Real
Shades Apart,"I know the face
I see it every day
I know your name
Forever in my mind
Don't walk away
I'm just trying to make some sense of this
Don't turn away
I'm just trying to make some sense of this
It's a secret life
For no one to see
What went wrong
You just weren't yourself
Someone else 
I guess I never knew
You lost control
I'm trying to make some sense of this
You just let go
I'm just trying to make some sense of this
Who were you then?
Can you take the blindness from my eyes?
It's not fair
Only you can let me see inside",Secret Life
Shades Apart,"Behind my back you sold me out
The master plan must matter more
You scratch my back I claw yours
It's no surprise
September burns ( Spent the months like days )
I believed the things you said
Should've stayed away instead
You lost everything you had
It's no surprise
All the effort gone to waste
Now I see your honest face
Here's a taste of what we lost
What's left to say? Nothing more to say",September Burns
Shades Apart,"I found a way out
Sick and tired of hearing how good things used to be
Live my life for me
I found a way out
You only brought me down
You wanted me to share in your misery
Is it so cool to whine?
I can only laugh about what happened to me
Finally out
I know what you're about
Tired of hearing how things aren't good anymore
Leaving you behind
Won't listen to your lines
I found out just in time
Not going down",Way Out
Shades Apart,"There's a shadow hanging over
And a ringing in your mind
Waiting for an answer still stuck in time
Couldn't leave the dark behind
In the mirror
Getting clearer
The sound of the future
The weight of the years
An echoed warning
Can't happen here
Do you believe it's almost summer
Everything is so alive
There's no limit where the road hits the sky
Get in the car and drive
It can't happen here
Rearranging the horizon
Changing circles into lines
Looking everywhere for some new paradise
The past is all you find",Weight of Years
Shades Apart,"everyone wants to know what happened there
everyone talks and talks, the stories go around

tell me how it really feels
to lose control
when you got behind the wheel

Second chance is still waiting there for me

I count down the miles, headlights hypnotize
From far away I realize, how she once believed in me
I let it slip right by
Scared of facing insecurities I locked away so far inside

Second chances, still waiting

And blasted off

Getting armored.  For armaggeon
When the east coast/west coast beef turns to hamburger
The microphone is my metal committing mental murder
My brain waves cascade through baracades
Searching for fascists to transform
Swing the vocal axes, if you didn't practice, it be embedded in your backs
Quick like faxes, from next to rasp(?) creeps
Turn around and face the music
Catch the mace to your face piece

CHORUS
Yet another hip-hop head took a turn for the worse
It must have hurt to have your realm burst
And certainly, crossing swords with me will spell your doom
Rev rev, the revolution is coming soon

[Verse 2]
If you see my shining smile you better duck or grab a mic
Because your universe will end in one single flash of light
When the Earth falls off its axis, you'll fly spinning into the cosmos
Do the same thing last night so you'll be searching for your lost prose
In outer space without a case, you can not judge me
Not that I would but if I do fall off, I'll spring back like bungee
Elasticized, never plastified like RuPaul
I'm the unseen terror, by night fall you might fall
Off your pedestal but leave my rhyme work alone
You can't decode my shit without the use of Rosetta stone
This ain't Costco or price chopper hip-hopper
Take one, the beat dropper, crush your head with the neck bopper

[Verse 3]
My roots extend deep into the planet
Through bedrock and magma, disintegrating granite
Back when Osiris and Isis circumnavigated the globe eliminating crisis
Struck down by treason, but what's the reason
For brothers against brothers, it's wrong in any season
Face facts, stay strong and be bold
Take a look at your past, let your soul unfold

Change your vector, your angle 

The complex rap erector 

Swallow your pride come to the stage and grab the mirco 

Phone, your life leaked, your fucked, mic's blown 

My shit's clear like mountain spring water 

You better reaching for that nickel plated ink blotter

I see them suckers turning yellow like was struck by jaundice 

It will be a cold day in hell before them fools get on this 

Tactics that make moves that blur your vision 

Some try, but come up dry like hair's that's not conditioned 

Why they risk it? They will be insane, they defeated 

False information to my peeps that I been seeing 

For X amount of years and yo we never had no static 

Them big yap kids, they need to break like a bad habit 

Silly rabbits, trying to get their rep up 

But they get wrecked up, when this verbalist decides to step up 

You, what's your function? 

Mine's to hit you like percussion 

Some need to think twice before they be coming in and rushing 

Yes, yes y'all you know we don't stop

Yes, yes y'all you know we never quit

Yo, here comes the Revolution and the Dark Shade 

With the rap attitude to never get payed, out 

You're laid out in a box, not yet 

You're never too young to die, want to bet 

Get thrown away from me like stuntmen on cables 

In a Jet Li movie, silber screen story fable 

Or Clive Barker's darker novels and short stories 

These rap skills make most MC chill, (EPMD sample 'chill') 

Up in the sky so high like cumulus, not Columbus 

I'm calculated like calculus 

I rock your shit from birth to the crypt, that's the deal 

Can you keep a secret like Egypt 

[D-Shade] 

I let it shoot from the start 

That I'm well skilled in this art 

I be moving like a Ferrari compared to a go-cart 

Put them shits in park 

It's the all terrain vechicle 

That brings the ruckus when I roll through your muncipal 

District get hit by this kid with sharper wits 

How a sucker want to rap with missing teeth and swollen lips 

Man, it's simple they gotta break out like a pimple 

Evacuate the premises, vanish like William Kimble 

'Cause Real people don't like those fakes who perpetrate 

That's why we come correct with all the rhymes that we state 

It's too late for apolagies 

I'm out to demolish these 

Obstacles in the way of we getting monopolies 

There is not stopping these 

What what, yo yo yo 

Yes, yes y'all we don't stop

And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

That cast long shadows cross my eyes 
Where traced out footsteps on the shores 
Of the sea of sorrow 
Reflect the changes in my life 

Holding out in a darkened room 
Long before the fall of rain shall come 
Listen to me 
For the last time that I was tempted to the dance of fools 
Closer to me 
I crawled away a loser 

I never knew it meant so much to hold a place of power 
Where only dreaming sets you free 
I never thought that you could hold me so completely 
You tore off my mask and I could see 

All the people in the street 
Double crossed by their own lives 
Bring them to me 
I want to take them to a new tomorrow of yesteryear 
Call them to me 
Let us live forever on 

Tonight I shall cast a stone into the sea of sorrow 
Its waves they crash beneath my feet 
Sorrow binds you to a life not worth living 
Unto that mortal life you cling 

Stripped of all your earthly pride with the fools you dance

Come unto me 
Send with great speed this message all across the land

Soon the cold will start to bite
And I'm kicking some old
Empty can
Down a barren street ya
Step into a dark saloon
Peer across the smoke filled room
I can feel her a mile away
She smiles and beckons me

Now we're dancing through the mist
Face to face I taste her breath
Our gaze locks into a hazy trance I start to quiver
Now she comes to comfort me I tell her I'm too blind to see
A warm bed and a fresh breath of air and you'll feel better

I know the feeling that you get
Too bad it's only for a moment
Lost in the shadows of the night
She turned and took my hand said
Stay by my side, slip between the light
Mirror my image we'll be alright

The key that opens up a thousand doors of mystery
Unlocks a basement full of fears
Start to unravel in it you might as well be blind
She saw my fright and closed her eyes

Don't fall in love it's a crazy nightmare
She looked at me and she winked an eye
It's too soon to say good-bye to this darktown
Could use a fortune of imagination
Refuse to look but I cannot deny
Gotta make it out tonight of this darktown

Sorry to leave you in this crazy nightmare

Won't stop the rain falling down my face

Sleep for hours eludes me drifting through the wind
I feel an evil eye on me all the time
The likes of which could turn and twist us all

Lying by my side she waits for me like long ago
I touch her face she cries to me my ship is waiting I must go

My eyes burn windows through the walls closing in on me
The faces of my past life are looking back at me what do they see

Scanned the windows won't forget I

Wakin' up to the sound to the sound of a broken heart

I was calling just to say I loved you
But I don't know if you're out there tonight

No longer crying my tears of cold remorse
That distant place in my heart still hurts of course
I do believe I will turn and say goodnight

In a hope that I'll never let fade

Are they yours are they mine I don't know

I hope you're with me tonight

My cloak and dagger 

I'm not so sure that I enjoy this journey 
They've got their guns to my head 
I turn myself into the black of darkness 
They chase their shadows instead

Took me to the place where the preacher lived 
He gave me serum 
And he blessed my mission helped me get my grip

Codes and weapons and my boarder pass

The mist of dawn still rising
Brushing from my face
Cold tears of finally knowing
The world that we had twisted
The years of strength and glory
Were wicked and obscene
And there we stood so proud
What legends we must be

So irresponsible
With the powers of creation

Robed in the finest cloth

And there was hatred in our eyes

And we saw through children's eyes
Not stifled by the pain
Not blinded by our
Human nature don't you see at all

The lies behind our ways
The reasons for the end

I now return here a survivor

And I am sure enough alive

to those of us who saw
What the rest could never see

Longing for a morning star
Held on high

As this vision comes to close
The last footsteps ever wonder here
They echo in my mind
Never to return

You pushed us into corners of a tortured paradise

The people as they pass

Outside I breathe the air
And all around fall shadows of despair

I wonder is there hope for us
A place where we can all be free
I wonder is there life inside a soul that dies?
I wonder is there hope for us
To lift me up I don't know when
I'll see the sun again
I'd like to feel alive
Just one more time

Today's bitterness is the calling card
The commercial masquerade
The goods all on parade
The needs of life are charming toys
We've gone deaf from all the noise
WHen did the rich and powerful elite
Slowly and unnoticed
Come and steal our innocense?

Entranced - we danced their dance
The stage is set the crowd is on their knees

I wonder is there hope for us
A place where we can all be free
I wonder is there life inside a soul that dies
I wonder is there hope for us

Do they all come alive and breathe?
It's no wonder
This is a brand new world we're on
I'd really like to meet you somewhere along

The way you come to me is such a mystery

A thousand miles from me and yet it's all right here

I never see your face you're such a mystery
Where you are I can only guess
Addictive screens
I just cannot turn away

Where are you anyway?
Those things you say seem so damn far from real
But I can tell you this
I have seen things for myself that just don't seem right
I have always been an honest man
I believed that the system
Worked for
You and for
Me but - no
You say it's just a show
And we've all been way too busy
Or too spoiled to even care who's got the wheel

I used to look behind the lies
Use to look for sunny skies
I learned so much since I've been
Hacking their computer systems
The truth had knocked me to the floor
That a boy now out the door
A little power and I'm
On my way to logging on the world

The way you come to me is such a mystery

Somewhere 'round late fall I knew that the time
Has come for me I'm willing a million stars above me
I tried to catch their fall I tried to catch their fall

Inside I felt so empty
A stranger to this world so lost
And as the winter draws I'm turning north

I'm leaving things behind I just don't need
The only things in life of worth are free
To anyone's who's heard the call
And turned and walked away

I've traveled too long on my own
I've got a dream of home
Safe at last...

Where are all the answers
And visionary wisdom
From the stately and esteemed?
Just as I thought...
Disconsolate I ponder
The evil human nature
And what it really means
For the ones who paved the way

No bag of gold can save their souls
It's like they never feared
But now their end is near
The flames start leaping

Baby don't it drop you to your knees?
The only thing in life of worth is free
To anyone's who's heard the call
And turned and run away

Despite this nasty world I roam
Imagine going home

I don't mean to intrude
But allow me to get right down to the point
We've monitored transmissions
We calculate your moves
Did you really think you're hidden from our sight?
Your name's been added to a list that's been compiled
Our agency considers you a risk

Secret power I can't believe
Growing stronger I feel them
Strengthening their grip

So there you are you crossed the line
You pathetic little man
Well rest assured the worst you feared is true
In the seduction of society we play upon desire
Spoiled and drunk that's you

Can this be happening?
This world is just a grand facade
You're just a simple man at heart
A victim playing out a part
Oh I just want my freedom
Where are the ones who back you now?
I feel abandoned fee like
Screaming at the walls
Too bad the walls have ears
This never ever should have been
But that's the way it is

This is the new world order
This is the corporate sponsored
Changing of the guard
The march is on
I can feel it - I can feel it's tyranny
It's all about the power
This rising new world order
Strong arm of the law
The march is on
I can see it - I can see it's tyranny

The point you fail to see is
The simple beauty of our subtle mind control
Brainwashing media is all we need to set the boundaries

Advanced communication
You're at our fingertips now
We own the TV stations
Entertainment, Publications
Wall street is our breeding ground
The sphere of our control extends through
Governments and leaders who will buy our arms
Yes buy our arms and run our evil wars
Run our evil wars run this evil world into the ground

This is the new world order
This your corporate sponsored life

I see through your disguises
Your rising new world order lies

You've no idea the power my new world order is alive

You don't really think you have a prayer
I don't know where to go to avoid your
Staring eyes and universal grasp upon all life
This world is mine!

Ahh the colors keep changing
So many different ways to look at things
I turn around I'/m upside down again
If nothing ever changes it's my point of view

I will journey ahead
To show you how far I have flown
New day in my life
Flashing hope by design
I've finally found my way home
Ahh so many different colors
Ahh now my world is slowly changing
So many different ways to look at things
If you've fallen down you gotta get back up again
So many different shades of everything
Now I see with open eyes a brighter world within
The skies forever changing that's the point of view
I just can't lose
This new born wisdom guides me through
Feel the cool winds of heaven
In the blue of your eyes
Dreams of you and I together
A love we cannot deny
Feel the tide of the ocean
On and on 'till I see your light
And the warmth of the sky
On and on
Passion breathes with emotion
We will soar
We will soar with wings on high
On high
On high
So many different ways to look at things
If we've fallen down we gotta get back up again
So many different ways the colors change
Every time I turn around we're hanging on the edge
Our skies forever changing that's the point of view
I give to you
I know that time will see us through
I hope the colors soon find you",Colors

Of all the roads a man could take
How mine has lead from you
And like a lighthouse
Set on a rocky coast amidst the storm
Your touch was warm and real
Looking out your window
Just what might lie ahead
Dreams still blow in the wind
And here we are memories run deeper and true
I'll always take you with me when I
Free-fall, free-fall
And the whole world goes to sleep
As a child the grand expanse the future must hold
Days to night waves washing over and over
And over your experience you
Lived each day like it's your last

On my journey towards the stars
Will I know when I reach the other side
The earth so blue it's like I'm dreaming
Now I'm on my way
Tainted shadows fall like rain
Through the dark vast weight only silence lingers on
The origin of existence lies somewhere far far beyond
I feel unattached tranquility
A hand from the heavens guiding me
And wondering where this path will lead
In a dream I'm lost and
Floating through the atmosphere
Searching for significance against
Infinity eternity
I've been taken by the vast and
Humbled by the weight of what I've seen
You know they called for heroes
'Cause heroes carry on
In know the world is fading
So from the first gray light of the morning I've been gone
Now I pray for a better life
For all the ones I love
We search beyond our reach
And turn our gaze above
I hope that it's the way
To fill our basic needs
And my sacrifice not vain
And I'll return again
The sands will filter through the timeless hourglass
As I pass beyond the god of war
Distant voices hear them crying out
I must seek out new worlds and explore
And I know that there just must be a place
We will carry on
Where our children can be free from the pain
The human race
It must be somewhere out in space
The sands will filter through the timeless hourglass
As I pass beyond the god of war
Distant voices hear them crying out
I must seek out new worlds and explore
And I know that there must be a place

Martian Landscapes worlds beyond
I touch down with no trace
No sign of life on this place
Now I feel a surge of energy
The deepest passion burns in me
Somewhere there is a world not left
To die
The stars will shine their light down unto me
Illuminating
The stars will shine their light and I will see
Will I find my way?
So back to the darkness I fly
In search of a hope in the sky
I should have known right from the start
I'll not return home
It seems so surreal as I go
The knowledge of science alone
Can't save all the people I know
That I've left behind
The sun I know is growing smaller
I drift for days on endless hours
And what's there to fear now!
No messages are getting through
I fall into the black abyss of night
I'm gone
The pioneering spirit charges the unknown
Accept the consequence of risk
I'm all alone here
Don't know if I'll return and
The fate of life is on my heart
I left a dying world behind
On my way oh
Where s our oasis in the sky
The future of our race
I left a poisoned world behind
Now I see there's no
Heaven bound oasis in the sky
Only dreams
I've got no destination
Helpless I drift on
The weight of silence how it's eating at my soul
And yet I sense a stirring
Something so spiritual
I wonder if the fate of mankind
Is in the hands of a higher power calling to us all
I left a dying world behind
On my way only
God can stop the spiral down to hell
The future of our race
I left a poisoned world behind

Can it be life sustained?

My reality, my life clear of repression

To suffer agonizing way, to live it heart full of fear

The pain, wake me for the day I die
Look into you, bring me the answers to my life

Nothing's forever, our life is done

You've destroyed all I've made
What will become of my legacy

I don't know why I even bother
Ending it all is the only answer to questions at hand 
The question of life and death to all answered at last
When they find me gone and they know my plan

They'll forget that they hate me and try to understand why I ended it all by choice
While they cry and mourn
I'll be peace at last

You step trough the door, your wife mouth start run
Laba, laba, laba, laba with Dieter Burton

You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes

Some say them a gangster but a studio gangster

Now him muma she cry water run from her eye

I reminisce about the time we had just me and you
And how much days and nights we spent upon that lonely cruise
You were the only one for me I bet I could not lose
And out of many beautiful women you are the one I choose
To love and honor and protect and even say ""I do""
But then you wanted us to part and that's when I refused
But still you left anyway and suddenly I had the blues
Now here's a the pass and no one else could ever fill your shoes

You sending me up bringing me down got my head just spinning around
Come on in get on out baby why you wanna go that route

Say you must be crazy (hey girl you must have giddy)
To still want to be my lady, yeeeah (mr lover, come back to me, ha)

Nothing in this world could extinguish my flames
You are the only one I wanted to bare my name
All of a sudden I notice you playing mind games
Giving me migraine so much emotional pain
You were the one and no one else could make that claim
It's a shame to see the relationship down the drain
Now you want us back together and it won't be the same
What your aim is it to cause me more pain

The weather is high
You can stretch right up
And touch the sky
When the weather is fine
You've got women
You've got women
On your mind
I'm gonna drive and ride and
See now what I can find

Now if her daddy's rich
Take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor
Then do as you feel
Speedin' down the lane even
Thought the speed limit's 25
And when the sun goes down
I'll make it with my cutie pie

Weh me say
Pretty little women
Sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey

It's a summertime affair
In the atmosphere
I man love off her attire
And the clothes she wear

Some burn off them with tyre
And a draw down a gear
Some a shine up wax up
Not a sign of snare

Got to be rolling in my
Christmas so the girl them stare
This is Shaggy and Rayvon
As your ultimate pair

Taking care of our career
So tell the world beware
'Cause it's a brand new
Selection for your musical ear

We say what we want and
We say what we need
And we love everybody
And we do as we please

And when the weather is fine,
We go fishin' we
Go fishin' in the sea
We are happy to live life

That's our philosophy

Now if her daddy's rich
Take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor
Then do as you feel
Speedin down the lane even
Thought the speed limit's 25
And when the sun goes down
I'll make it with my cutie pie

Sweat a run off her body
With her caramel skin
I man smiled at her she
Looked at me and grinned

I offered her a drink she said
Juice and Gin
And I whispered in her ear
I asked how you doin'

Where was it that I reside
And I told her Brooklyn
Atmosphere filled with romance
Her eyes sparkling

Just her voice and what
She said let my poor head spin
Raggamuffin Shaggy
With a musical swing

I say
Pretty little woman
Sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey

When the weather is high
You can stretch right up

And touch the sky
When the weather is fine

To preserve the youths of tomorrow

Another youth get murder a victim of the law
Rude boy get murder cops were quicker on the draw
Another youth get murder a victim of the law

Pull off a robbery but the cops he never saw
He got surrounded and they crushed him like a straw
John Doe went out like that
No, no, no
He heard them coming but he didn't get to flee
Wanted by the cops was living like a refugee
Do no evil think no evil try it and you will see

Trying to hustle and make a dollar ain't got no 9 to 5
watching my back when going home and trying to stay alive
Got to strive, got to strive, got to strive
Johnny was a gangster well ain't life a bitch
Robbing with his homies then they got ditched
Thought he was the man but he was rolling with a snitch
All he wanted to do was get rich

And give thanks to the Father for the blessings that he shined on me
I sing a little song of praise
Though I know that everybody ain't as fortunate as I may be
One more time I say
Words cannot express appreciation what he's done for me
Right now I say thank you Lord

[Chorus]

When I look back at all the things that the Father has done for me
I give thanks to the Lord and everyday i'm on my knee
Write the song now to please
No matter the color nor the creed
It was invested in me I'm here to do a good deed hey
I try to put a smile on your face
I write a simple song so it appeals to your taste
I tried to do the things that people appreciate
Well thanks for the music that they all embrace
And I say thank you Lord

[Chorus]

Say I'm in no competition
But I have made my decision
You can keep your opinion
I am just a calling on the wise man communion

[Chorus]

I thank the Lord once again for the power of the pen
Yes I be making ends to feed my family and my friends
Push out my Benz check your lens
Beg you ease up off my fence
Mi afi push out my mother in the latest gems
I have to put the food upon mi table
Have to feed the little mouth them in my stable
Hail up to the Big Yard label
And me say thank you Massa God that I am able
Give thanks to the Lord

[Chorus]

Said I want to thank you
Shaggy want to thank you now
Said the people got to thank you",Thank You Lord

You think a so it go no when a DJ work hard
Bus all him sweat fa sell a million record
While some people a relex a dem yard
Si down and a draw bad card
Well then the bag a lip service it nah help the plan

This is something a got to tell to everyone
So make we move as one

Wey we a do weh we try
Beg you listen to the Shags
Sit down and reminisce when me a DJ session
When promoter all a rob me and the singer Rayvon
Can't find taxi fare fi reach a Flatbush bottom
To beat the system me have to strong
Full of determination
Make dem know so that the DJ have to hit number 1
Through the grace of the almighty
The gift to write a song
My dream turn to reality when the Grammy touch me hand bim
No mek me settle down and pause fe a secound
Sting International, Robert Livingston, Gibraltor, Paul O Rossi
And the Ruff Entry Gang
Hot cold and freezing down a Long Island

They say many are called but the chosen is few
Know why is it you want to disrespect the crew
And you don't like fe se another DJ go through
I remember whem dem a express them negative views
And a name me as the DJ most likely to lose
When dem si down and give me bad album review
Se me a foreign DJ can't make hit tune
When me hit number one them find a bag of excuse
Se me management a mafia and me color get me through
Now me hit them like a puzzle mek them can't find a clue
And through the big broad smile I and I man see through

[Chorus]

I remember when I man all a bleach a session
I remember when I man have no dollars in mi hand
I remember when I man all a fight fi Uncle Sam
I remember when I man all a face sentance
I remember all the DJ wey a chat mike fi long
Them time the dance use to ram and gunshot done session
When the DJ dem fight over the same mike stand

What is venga mi casa I really don't know
From the way that she smiled I could tell how the story would go

Have me wondering now
Is it really me or tell me do you feel the same
I feel like I'm in love and I don't even know your name
I know what I am saying to you may sound pretty lame
Your love is like an everlasting flame

Just twenty five, I'm not ready yet
Hey love let's make a deal
Give me some time I got a few hearts to steal
Hey love got more grounds to gain
Can't get stuck with a ball and a chain
Hey love I need to be sure
Come back and see me in two years or more

I remember as a kid I used to dream
I had a big crush on Sandra's kid sister Jean
But she was in love with Dwayne
Been so many years but I still feel the pain
What about the girl across the street
Took the same bus I use to reserve her seat
But she would just sit with her friends 
And the all talk about guys in Bimmers and Benz
Seem like my luck took a slide
Then shorty came along and stood by my side
I couldn't give her much but she stayed
Now I'm hitting all the charts it's so easy getting laid
Living in style I'm getting paid
Hooking up my peeps with the millions I've made
Now I'm having girl who I knew in first grade
Now I'm kinda feeling like my shorty getting played 
( so I'm begging you )

Hey love I need to be sure
Come back and see me in two years or more

I wasn't popular in school I wasn't popular in sports
All the girls I love loved the guys on the court
I feel like I been cheated of my youth 
'Cause back in the days braces weren't so cute
Girls used to laugh at my suit
Now I got models in bed knocking boots

Now I'm kinda feeling like my shorty getting played

Shaggy,"Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

How you can grant the woman access to your villa
Trespasser and a witness while you cling to your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner
To be a true player you have to know how to play
If she say a night, convince her say a day
Never admit to a word when she say and if she claims
And you tell her baby no way

But she caught me on the counter (It wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (It wasn't me)]
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (It wasn't me)

She saw the marks on my shoulder (It wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (It wasn't me)
Heard the scream get louder (It wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her
From what she was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me

Make sure she knows it's not you and lead her on the right prefix
Whenever you should see her make the giggolo flex
As funny as it be by you, it not that complex
Seeing is believing so you better change your specs
You know she not gonna be worrying 'bout things from the past
Hardly recollecting and then she'll go to noontime mass
Wait for your answer: go over there
But if she pack a gun you know you better run fast

But she caught me on the counter (It wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (It wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (It wasn't me)

She saw the marks on my shoulder (It wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (It wasn't me)
Heard the scream get louder (It wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

Gonna tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listening to your reasoning
It makes no sense at all
We should tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
That's why I sing

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me",It Wasn't Me
Shaggy,"Uh- that's right
Reality check
You know what I mean
Street life's eh
Scorpion yeah uh

When I was young
I use to dream of being rich
Have a lot of houses and cars 
Couldn't know which one was which
And finding me a chick and getting hitched
Living the fairy tale life perfect without a ditch
You think that this would bring me happiness
If at the end of every rainbow 
There was a treasure chest
Sometimes having more is really less
So take a look inside yourself
You'll realize you're really blessed
No matter how you're sad and blue
There's always someone who has it worse than you
Sometimes you gotta pay your dues
So don't worry just push on through

Keep'n it real
Gotta big up all my peoples who be working on the future
Though they know they gotta struggle
Keep'n it real
To all my homies working on the 9 to 5
And doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble
Keep'n it real
Although sometimes I know it seems impossible
There ain't no need in drowning in your sorrows
Keep'n it real
If things are as bad as they can be
You can be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow

If things are as bad as they can be
You can be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow

And I forgot to have myself the house, the mansion, and the Benz
I'm not the type of brother who be making mad ends
I got myself a girl but we be kickin' it as friends
Is not enough for me now that depends
Again- not everthing you want is everything you really need
The standard of society is modevated by greed
Are you prepared to follow
Tell me are you prepared to lead
So persevere and you'll succeed

Keep'n it real
Gotta big up all my peoples who be working on the future

You can be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow

*Hook*
All the harsh realities
Appears to come in twos and threes
Don't worry 'cause 
There'll be a better day
One thing I can promise you
Just keep on keeping on
I swear to you 
There's gonna be a brighter day

Keep'n it real
Gotta big up all my peoples who be working on the future

One on one
Give you a little love escapade, 
You know what I'm saying?
Mr. Lover

Candlelight, dinner for two
Just me and you
Under the moon, 
Sailing on a summer night cruise
I mean to rock your whole world baby
I'm da man allowed to drive you crazy
Set the motion to the ocean,
Cause some commotion 
Girl surrender to my love potion
I'll hit you off now with some hot oil lotion
I play it safe so let me break out my Trojan

Leave it to me, baby
We can turn on the heat, baby
And wrinkle the sheets, baby
Whatever you need, baby (X2)

Now let me find a day real fine
Hot tub, jacuzzi, caviar with some white wine
Girl, I'm livin'-livin' in style
Mansion in the hills and not another house for miles
Now let me take you and show off my pet reptile
In two days gonna feed it to my rottwiler
No interruptions today
Leave it to me and have things my way

Leave it to me, baby
We can turn on the heat, baby
And wrinkle the sheets, baby
Whatever you need, baby (X2)

`Cuz I like the way you do the things you do
I want to make sweet love to you (X2)

I want to send chills up your spine
And make you feel good inside
And explode just like a land mine
I'm here to cunt and thrill and that's my mission
Love-making with timing and precision
My skills is kickin'
An' like breakin'
Proper lovin; leave you hummin
Sweet melodies of future come
Prepare to get soaked in sweat, girl, yeah
`Cuz you ain't seen nothin' yet

Shaggy,"Boy what have you done for me 
I've been going down on you 
You not going down on me 
Girl that's how a rude boy plays
I don't have to take you there
I can please you in other ways 
Across the hall neighbors hear the sound 
Mr. lover Lover in town 
Carpet burns from being on the ground 
Rudy have hot gal a moan and groan 
Oh dawn the phone 
Baby don't stop Yeah you like that Simone
Champion lover the best pound for pound
Take you to the clouds without going downtown 
Why why don't you just change your ways 
Won't you open up your mind 
Boy we're living in modern days
Girl I'm coming from the school
Where if you want the job done right 
You have to used the proper tool 
You never been love until you've been filled 
Filled full of pleasure from a rude boy's skill
Passion and ecstasy you know the drill
Full up your cup till your juice's spill
Leave the door open just for the thrill
Now we're at the point where you can't keep still
Covered in sweat but feeling the chill
That's the effect of a lover man's pill 
Tell me why you want to tease me (baby)
don't you want to please me 
Why you holding back when I know what's on you mind (repeat)",Not Fair
Shaggy,"Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.",Why Me Lord?

Shaggy,"Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

How you can grant the woman access to your villa
Trespasser and a witness while you cling to your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner
To be a true player you have to know how to play
If she say a night, convince her say a day
Never admit to a word when she say and if she claims
And you tell her baby no way

But she caught me on the counter (It wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (It wasn't me)]
I even had her in the shower (It wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (It wasn't me)

She saw the marks on my shoulder (It wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (It wasn't me)
Heard the scream get louder (It wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her
From what she was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me

Make sure she knows it's not you and lead her on the right prefix
Whenever you should see her make the giggolo flex
As funny as it be by you, it not that complex
Seeing is believing so you better change your specs
You know she not gonna be worrying 'bout things from the past
Hardly recollecting and then she'll go to noontime mass
Wait for your answer: go over there
But if she pack a gun you know you better run fast

Early Sunday morning in the spring of ninety-six
I'm chilling on my couch watching the Bulls against the Knicks
My honey marches in and ask if I think I'm slick
It seem she found my shirt with lipstick
I thought I could explain but then my story wouldn't stick
Incriminating pictures show me some other chick
It happened once before and she was tired of the tricks
She asked me if I can spell the word evict

(Why me Lord?)
Situation looking kinda bad
(Why me Lord?)
I lost the best girl I ever had
(Why me Lord?)
I'm homeless and I'm feelin' kinda sad

Just the other day when I was rolling with my crew
Made a little flex around by Flatbush avenue
Calling to some honeys and sipping on my brew
That's when I saw the boys in blue
They pulled me to the side why I don't even have a clue
An' looking for a reason and they finally found a few
A case of ammunition with a loaded thirty two
I can't believe what I'm going through

Why me, Lord?
(Here I am, I gotta face the time)
Why me, Lord?
(Though the evidence ain't even mine)
Why me, Lord?
(I swear, I ain't guilty of the crime)

Take heed never take advantage of the things you need
Never let yourself be over come by greed
Walk the straight and narrow and you shall succeed
Get your act up to speed
And try no matter what it takes to give a next man a blye
Everybody else deserve a piece o' the pie
Honesty the best policy no sell no samfie
You no need fi ta ask why

Tell me what you wanna do and where you wanna go
Ain't no need to rush it baby, we can take it slow
I swear it must be Cupid shooting arrows with his bow
I notice in your eyes a certain glow

Have me wondering now
Is it really me or tell me do you feel the same?
I feel like I'm in love and I don't even know your name
I know what I am saying to you may sound pretty lame
Your love is like an everlasting flame

So I know you understand?
Maybe I should start by making gestures with my hand
Girl, you're like a rising star and I'm your biggest fan
My sweet Bonita diva with the tan

Got me thinking baby
We could make a life together on the ocean shore
Paradise is where you are, I'm ready to explore
Can never get enough of you, it's all about amour
And happiness is knocking at your door

Shaggy,"I remember, wasn't so long ago
We had a one room shack and the livin' was low
And my Mama by herself raised me and my bro
Wasn't easy, but we did it with the little that go
Worked hard while the suckers cool every day
And kept her eyes on the stars when the skies were gray
Gave us drive to survive, really showed us the way
Now I really understood what she was tryin' to say

She said, ""Son there'll be times when the tides are high
And the boat may be rocky, you can cry
Just never give up
You can never give up uh-uh
In this life you could lead if you only believe
And in order to achieve what you need
You can never give up
You can never give up""

And this hope
That keep me holding on
And this hope
That makes me carry on

Home grown, couldn't have made it alone
I got a wonderful life, two kids on my own
With a strong foundation that was carved in stone
And my mama for the love that made my house a home
Made me wonder some time if this was meant to be
All this for a humble little guy like me
And all I ever really wanted was a family
To teach my kids the same value that she gave to me

She said ""Son there'll be times when the tides are high
And the boat may be rocky, you can cry
Just never give up
You can never give up uh-uh
In this life you could lead if you only believe
And in order to achieve what you need
You can never give up
You can never give up""

And this hope
That keep me holding on
And this hope
That makes me carry on

We nah turn no stepper, things a go better
Never make yourself be overcome by pressure
Cool ya me bredda, have faith instead a
Sid-dung and a watch an all a fight one another
Blaze like fire, nah go retire
Got naf sleep and a him inspire
We fi reach higher a that him require
Haffi mek we mark before the time is expire

And this hope
That keep me holding on
And on
And this hope
That makes me carry on
On and on

And this hope
That keep me holding on
And on
And this hope
That makes me carry on

And this hope
That keep me holding on
Keep it carry on, keep it carry on, yeah

Met this girl on South Beach last summer
Mummy got back, but she ain't no stunner
Chat for a while and i had a few drinks
Well the next thing you know
We were fogging up the Hummer
Now the chick's banging on my door like a hammer
Stalking my house, big tap like a plumber
Couldn't keep myself cuz
I thought with my brain, i would haveleft her alone
She got laced, the opportunity was right in my face
And that's how she ended up back in my place
I wish i could go back in time

No I won't stop gotta make it to the top
Hell no I won't stop
Aiming for the sweet spot
Powers to the bald heads and the dreadlocks
Let me make it clear no we won't flop
Got a plan got to make it anyway I can
Putting in the work with my own two hands
Better check it respect it
I'm a man I'm a West Indian

Shaggy,"Closest to me she must be a good child?
Don't ignore the signs, that's right
You be her teacher, taking

Shivering, she awakes in the cold sweat
Terrified so she speaks under her breathe
Makes a fake cry for help, she's a real mess
That's the sign of the stress, ma, listen to her

Heartbeats working overtime in her chest
Scared stiff from approaching footsteps
Ignoring the stains on her torn dress
Come now ma, listen to her

How could you put your own child in danger?
And turn around and take the words of a stranger
You didn't wanna face the facts so you blamed her
Too late ma, you should have listened to her

Gone, she's asleep, finally, she's at peace
With the angels
Gone, out of reach, finally, souls in peace
With the angels

She's fading like a delicate flower
Try to wash away the shame in the shower
Defending him left her feeling overpowered
You were wrong ma, you didn't listen to her

It was there in the words of the letter
Had you read it maybe things would be better
You let her down and I won't let you forget her
Save ya tears ma, you should have listened to her

How could you put your own child in danger?
And turn around and take the words of a stranger
You didn't wanna face the facts so you blamed her
Save ya tears ma, you didn't listen to her

Gone, she's asleep, finally, she's at peace
With the angels
Gone, out of reach, finally, souls in peace

Why day, why day
Why day, why day

Gone, she's asleep, finally, she's at peace

Gone, out of reach, finally, souls in peace

Shaggy,"Ya, I gotta get real personal on this ya know, for me
[Incomprehensible] screamin' out two things

When I was young my ambition in life
Was to finish way ahead of the game
Such a shame ya'll payin' the price
In this race of fortune and fame

I really feel apologetic inside
Though you'd never think to give me the blame
It's when I look into your lives
I wonder if it was really worth all the pain

Now I know what it take in the heights of mistakes
Is it there in the mind of a child?
Though it's all for our sakes, still my heart, how it breaks
Every time that I see your smile, check it

Conversation on the phone is fine
But for me it could never replace
Being there to spend quality time
Tuck you in to see the smile on your face

So when you're old enough to read these lines
I hope you never find yourself in my place
I hope you never feel as lonely as I
And miss the warmth of your child's embrace

Now I know what it take in the heights of mistakes
Is it there in the mind of a child? No, no, no, no
Though it's all for our sakes, still my heart, how it breaks
Every time that I see your smile

Now I know what it takes, in the heights of mistakes
Is it there in the mind of a child? No, no, no, no
Though it's all for our sakes, still my heart, how it breaks
Every time that I see your smile

Now I know what it takes, in the heights of mistakes
Is it there in the mind of a child?
Though it's all for our sakes, still my heart, how it breaks
Every time that I see your smile

Go 'head do what you came to do
Wanna know all the things that I used to do
When I keep it on the real you get an attitude
You want the truth, you can't handle the truth

Go 'head do what you came to do
You want to follow my past well it's up to you
When I keep it on the real don't get an attitude
You want the truth, you can't handle the truth

Don't ask 'bout the past you should let some things be
No need to concern 'bout the man she has seen
You ask how many she tell you just three
Knowing that your ego can't handle thirteen

It's best not to ask 'bout her previous guys
Unless you are willin' to handle her lies
Especially when she's discussin' their size
You just might be in for a bigger surprise

You're diggin' for info that you really don't wanna hear
You're stirrin' the feelings that you know you can't really bare
So what if the answers you can prevent your biggest fear
Now ask yourself are you really prepared?

The many positions she did made your day
I know you must wonder how she got that way
Don't ask you might not wanna hear what she'll say

Just look in the past and the ways you had fun
Would you wanna know when the things you had done
She might lose her cool and be tempted to run
So what heave you learned when it's all said and done

You're diggin' for info that you really don't wanna hear
You're stirrin' the feelings that you know you can't really bare

Shaggy,"Ultimatum, badman nuh tek ultimatum, 
Go wey, yuh haffi stay 

If I stay, would you put an end 
To all the games you play 
Can you promise me 
That you will never stray 
Has to be a new beginning from today, 
Only way I will stay 
But if I go, 
This will be the final curtain of the show 
You have lost the best thing 
That you ever known 
Guess you have to learn 
To make it on your own 
Let me know stay or go 

Before you go let's analyze the situation 
I'm a typical Jamaican 
Why you layin' your frustration on me 
When we met it was a perfect combination 
But you know my reputation 
Don't know what you were expecting (of) me 
Fight back, you can fight 
Get things a go if yuh nuh like that 
Cause I know that 
When you (leave) you come right back 
Your new founded termination 
Sounds to me like desperation 
There's no ground for termination 

If I stay, would you put an end 
To all the games you play 
Can you promise me 
That you will never stray 
Has to be a new beginning from today, 
Only way I will stay 
But if I go, 
This will be the final curtain of the show 
You have lost the best thing 
That you ever known 
Guess you have to learn 
To make it on your own 
Let me know stay or go 

I must admit I have a weakness 
For these women 
Who a plot like them a villain try the best 
To separate you from me 
I don't understand 
Just why the hell your cousin 
When you knew that she meant nothin' 
So what if she was your cousin 
You say fight back, 
How the hell could I resist 
When she's dressed like that 
Tell the truth I had to leave 
But she came right back 
Now you heard the explanation 
Taken to consideration 
It was sexual frustration 

If I stay, would you put a end 
To all the games you play 
Can you promise me 
That you will never stray 
Has to be a new beginning from today, 
Only way I will stay 
But if I go,

Baby baby tell me 
Why your in a hurry to leave

See a lot I can't believe 
That this is happenin' to me 
(Goodbye my darlin') 
Yeah I know I made mistakes 
But this is meant to be 
(Goodbye my darlin') 
I promise I'll do better 
Baby stay with me 

If I stay, would you put a end 
To all the games you play 
Can you promise me

Wear a precious diamond with all them polish shine
Can't wait to hold you closer, can you read my mind?

Clear images for which I won't apologize
I hope that you can see the passion in my eyes
Won't over step our boundaries, these words are hard to find
Stated my intentions, hope you my way inclined

Tell me if I'm wrong expressing how I feel
How can I go on if I don't know the deal?

You feel my record, can I say this ain't no player's game?
You feel the spark between us, come let's ignite the flame
'Coz if you let it pass we'll only have ourselves to blame

Showing you a world of pleasure, that's my only aim
I wanna take ya to the clouds and let you scream my name
This is your decision, baby, stake your claim
Take a chance 'coz if you don't then it would be a shame

Tell me am I'm wrong expressing how I feel?
Can I go on if I don't know the deal, hey?

Walk a king stone an keep a singing, I muss suggesting dis?
Show you babe, I'm feeling this is right, that's right
Don't be lonely baby, come with mi tonight
Babe, show me, show me the best time of my life, I love ya

Now would you be offended if I told ya

A little more love

I need your love

Now as I wake up in the mornin', meet the risin' sun
You're on my mind throughout the day
Could hardly get things done
It's that love that you give comparison to none
Cupid gave me a shot from a loaded gun

There is no love like this I've ever seen her with
Love strikes, got me all believe it
Sweaty palm and the tearful eye
The thought of you brings me butterflies

You complain that I'm so stuck in my ways
Insecurity is what I seldom display
It's unexplainable that love I feel for you each day

After me spend the whole night with me darling
And the pager go off and she a wonder who's calling?
Look upon her face, me done take that as the warning

Ragga, ragga, me no pet gal feel real
Make them know me no romp when we a do it

From the hair style to the pedicure toes
Gal, mesmerize from the lyrical flows
We have the argument to con her out of she clothes

She knows that bank in the days 'pon the ends
Situation used to make the wise girl tense
That's when she hear about me and her girlfriends
Me never romp to switch them up on every weekends

Just showing me your side to you I've never really seen
No need to brandish your steel

Have me deya all a hope say you might miss
There's no reason for this permanent goodnight kiss

Never sleep, never calm, never heed to the warn
Made her angry now she gone, never shoulda mash her corn
Never witness from your born, devil in a woman's form

Gather round my wealthy friends and endure the horrifying sights
Only your worst nightmares can produce
Actual human beings of a deformed nature
Come at once and come and indulge yourself
In our own twisted amusement of another's misfortune
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, enter our three ring show of freaks""

Ring one, a dung a dung dung
My name's Violent J and I staple my tongue
To the desk in school then I run down the hall
Scaring the shit out of all y'all bitches
Which is why you don't invite mine to your parties
Just 'cause I don't look like everybody
I guess you're just a bunch of hot shots
They act like they ain't never seen a Cyclops

And what's the big deal about my neck
Just because now and then I like to let it stretch
Up a couple feet to get a better sight
Is that any reason to scream and run in fright
No, so, what's up with that?
So what if I got another arm growing out of my back
I guess I'm just another freak show thing
And now they got me in the three ring

Three ring a ding a ding ding, people love to point and stare
Three ring a ding a ding ding, it's the same as everywhere
Three ring a ding a ding ding, people love to point and stare
Three ring a ding a ding ding, it's the same as everywhere

Ring two, how do you do?
I'm Shaggy 2 Dope, chicken-faced bitch, who?
You don't try to front ho
Try to play me out just 'cause I'm an albino
Or maybe it's the sack growin' out my neck
But don't jet baby, heh, not yet
I'm popping in like a pound of lead
Black n blue, his next roll and drop me on my head

Oh shit, I knew I had to fuck up my circuits
'Cause when I was two, my momma left me at the circus
Abandoned at the carnival with the freak shows
Like bad boys, hermaphrodites and old man crow
But then I escaped to the ghetto zone
Started a crew of my own, motherfucker, I'm not alone
So don't be stickin', your finger in my face stank
Or your stomach might receive a shank from the

Three ring a ding a ding ding, people love to point and stare
Three ring a ding a ding ding, it's the same as everywhere
Three ring a ding a ding ding, people love to point and stare
Three ring a ding a ding ding, it's the same as everywhere

I certainly hope you're enjoying yourselves
Here at our three ring exhibit
But to be honest I really don't see
What's so fuckin' funny about it
These fuckin' people are real

Ring three, the ICP
Look if you want but I wouldn't lay a hand on me
That's how you get fucked up
We'll squeeze your windpipe shut
Yo, I'm a nerd word, I drink Thunderbird
I chill with my homies on a crackhouse curb
Nobody wanna hang with a freak
Who's clinically dead with no heart beat

Fuck that, bitch, suck that
I was born with a wang but I never had a nut sac
Just two balls hanging with no protection so
I move real careful and slow
You can call me a weirdo, call me a freak
Just 'cause my nose curl up like the iron shriek
Is that the reason nobody wanna hang, fuck It
I chill with the three rings

Three ring a ding a ding ding, people love to point and stare
Three ring a ding a ding ding, it's the same as everywhere

Well, that's it, I hope you're satisfied
I hope you had a good time
You fucking heartless bastards
You saw what you wanted
So grab your fucking kids
And that fat flop of shit wife of yours
And get the fuck out of our circus tent

You cold-hearted sons of bitches
You think they look fucked up
Just wait till I kick your
Fucking lips in a couple times
You'll be sitting up here like a bitch
And we'll laughing at your folded ass

They'll call you lumpy after I done put knots
All over your fuckin' forehead, yeah
Hey, hey little boy, come here
How'd you like it if I tied your neck in a knot
You fucking little bitch
Come here, I'll shove that
Fucking corn dog up your ass

With his fist comin' straight for your spine

Bein chased by some thugs in a car I run faster
I'm never gonna die cause I'm part of somethin bigger
Never gonna flat line, never need no grave digger
This the real whicked shit from Detroit, the running man
When the summer streets heat up and the murdas come again
I'm never gonna die slow, I'm never goin quick
Never leave the world as long as fat chicks blowin dick
I'll never die broke or ritch, I'll never die at all,

Your life, your life, your liiiii...i-iiii...i-ife

VERSE 1
I awake, floatin 3 feet off my bed,
An old cardboard box, no shoes, no socks,
But lots of karma, I'm smiley-whilin,
Giddy-as-fuck, though grimey-stylin.
I gots no home, I gots no bones,
Just happy to be alive and checkin payphones,
For a quarter over here, a nickel over there,
Flat broke, but I got a lot of karma to share.

CHORUS
I can make mountains get up and move out my way,
Hear that paradise has offered me a place to stay,
I don't waste a day, I don't starve for nothing,
I'm the karma millionaire, always happy 'bout something.
I say live out your days coz you ain't gettin shit back,
Bitch around me will only get you your lip smacked,
Karma over any drug dealers supply,
Coz I can do anything with it except die.

VERSE 2
The bail man's tryin to find me, I'm deep into thoughts,
And I bounce everytime a car passes with the bumps,
I'm the hobo with all the jokes to tell,
Full of karma through the roof and I'm broke as hell.
Whether the life slows down, or if it throws down,
I'm beaming karma and I'm glad to be around,
This city get cold as ice, I'm out there,
But my karma keep me warm like some thermal underwear.

VERSE 3
Let me see a bad weather, I got sunshine for ya,
Front me with that sad shit, I'll fuckin ignore ya,
My days are always fly days,
I like everybody else on them over-crowded highways.
I says karma's worth more than money or love,
Or any of the above,
Mine blows off, and shows off my charisma,
Happy nobody here that say that there is none.

Content to stargaze at the skies.

The type of girl that makes me wanna give up other people's property
I really, really like the way that I feel and the way that I feel for you is for real

All I wanna do is be good to you
And give you all the love I wanna give to you
I hope you realize that this feelin' is right
And I'll be waitin' for the day when you will spend the night

I'm waiting, I'm waiting
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for the day
I'm waiting, I'm waiting
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for the day
I'm waiting, I'm waiting
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for the day

I'm waitin' for the day that you will stay all night
Baby I'm waitin' for the day you'll say the timing's right
I don't need no explanation girl, I know just how you feel
The love is real, the love is real

And I'm waitin' for the day that you will stay all night

Mmm 
Still don't know what I was waitin' for 
And my time was runnin' wild 
A million dead end streets and 
Every time I thought I'd got it made

But I can't trace time 
Mmm, yeah I watch the ripples change their size 
But never leave the stream 
Of warm impermanence 
So the days float through my eyes 
But still the days seem the same 
And these children that you spit on 
As they try to change their worlds 
Are immune to your consultations 
They're quite aware of what they're goin' through

Turn and face the strange

Don't tell them to grow up and out of it

Where's your shame? 
You've left us up to our necks in it 
Time may change me

Ah, changes are takin'

Somebody's offering a job a thousand miles away

So I, I'm turning to you
Because you always seem to know what to do
When times like these arrive, I call

So I, I wanna to know, should I really, really go?
And if so, are you coming with me?
I, I got to know, if you really want me to go
And if so, come with me

I never wanted anything as much as I want you with me
You were the one who said to follow my dreams
Of having a house, a car, a view of the stars, and a beautiful wife
So I need someone I can go with, I need some love in my life

Shai,"Infiltrate them
Disintegrate them
Terminate my fire
Create your own desire

Don't let them drag you under
Towards their paradise
I am the fallen angel
The only one am I

Be my dream this night
Hide me from daylight
Shelter me all times
Hide me from the light

Help me free you
Save yourselves from their eyes
See what holds you
And controls you

Infiltrate them
Disintegrate them
Terminate my fire
Create your own desire

And now the stage is falling
Towards their own demise
Don't look to me for answers
To questions I despise

Be my dream this night
Hide me from daylight
Shelter me all times
Hide me from the lines

Falling down
Crawling down

Deeper into the surreal landscape
Interlocking this dream reality
Remind me to remember to forget
My vast collection of memories

But they will paralyze you
To hide the things they do
The scene is set for freedom
So slip away from me

Be my dream this night
Hide me from daylight
Shelter me all times
Hide me from the lines

Life, check it out

Tell me sometimes do you feel like
You're servin' no purpose in life
And you ask yourself all these questions why
And life still passes you by, tell me

Did you know, did you know
That what you do affects the stars above
And the earth and the moon and the sun
And did you know
That me and you represent peace and love
If you feel like we do

So if you feel like we do
Then vive with the music
Just let us enter your soul
And if you know like we know
Then you've got to use it
Just let it take control

Ooh, aah

Stop and think now what it's all about
And maybe you too will find
That your reality is without a doubt
Just a reflections of the thoughts on your mind, listen

Life is just what you do based on the things you know
You've got to find what you're here for
So if you just know yourself everything else will flow
So if you feel like we do

So if you feel like we do
Then vive with the music
Just let us enter your soul
And if you know like we know
Then you've got to use it
Just let it take control

So if you feel like we do

Through the years, untested waters

A claim to inflict punishment for those who have been unjust

A sad bitter man whose contempt for himself exceded his contempt for the world 
No remorse for those who chis spirit 
A sad bitter lot whose lack of insight left a man broken

Metal meter in my hand
Sportin' a pocket full of change
That's me in the street with a violin under my chin

And this is what the children shall learn...
A new precept for the world to adopt.

Rough diamonds in the palms of fools
Prepare for the lowest standard.
Unable to give the crucial gift of reason.

The unwise teaching wisdom.
Fools, unable to give the crucial gift of reason.
The absurd defining priority.

What more can be expected of a child,
Being a product of the stark worst -
Its fathers blood.

Censure rightly;
The ascendants,
Make no mistake.
They are veritably criminal.

Down the random path of chance.
Fare thee well


Godspeed.
Against the wind,
Set sail,
Under the misguiding light of faulty beacons.

Set sail,
With vices for virtues,
Against the wind,
Dishonor for ethics,
And excess for etiquette,
As examples -

Such sorry examples.
And what of the children...

Ignorant of it's weight.

Blind to it's worth.

Something is terribly amiss
Is nothing but a burden.
When the beauty and the miracle of new life

This burden is a child.
This burden is a life

Speaking of truth and loyalty.
Men without dedication
Women without conviction

Teaching respect and compassion.
No.

And what of the children...



",Being Exemplary
Shai Hulud,"It is truly the perfect being

Its armor is tenfold shields
Its teeth, swords
Claws in the guise of greeting hands

How does it sleep at night
This tyrant?
Heaping slaves on the pyre
Just to watch ambition burn

It is truly the perfect being

It's armor is tenfold shields
And from its tongue, fire

Could any being verily bask in malevolence
As if its indifference might pardon it?
This tyrant

He is the fatherless
With the arrogance of a being that insists it created itself

What can it create?
This uninspired muse rules only barren lands
It cannot create a thing

When the public speaks the truth
Simply tear it down

Dissent, and smolder

Your thoughts are law, great dragon
Just spare me and mine
While I bide my time
Knowing you well
The enemy

Cover may the every men

A would-be dragon

The poorest excuse of a man

My teeth to swords
My hands to claws
And fire...

The shame of only two appalling options:
A taker of life, or a dead man
This is why the wives, the mothers, and children are mourning

As blood to heart

Lest death intrudes by means of its
Flawed emissary, man

There will be no victors, only bereaved
This is why we mourn

And still we are not sleepless

Rather than sulk in the ruins of a fallen sky castle

I clearly see the slayers, and the hope they destroy
I clearly see the thieves, and the wonders they deprive the inspired

With which I love is a travesty

The color of pitch is cold and hard
And it's merciless to the tenderhearted

How I miss the strength of red blood
Its susceptibility to burn jet
And the might to withstand a brutal scorching

How I have learned to wield this scorched, jet blood
To the gross advantage
This blood must not go to waste
All is not yet lost

Take these words of blood ill-tempered
Take these words and
Cut deep
Lacerate the soiled flesh
Impact the brittle bone

And we all will bleed together
May this blood pave the way to solution

We have all been so wrong
Conditioned to accept and approve of substandard
Communication and behavior
Reason is clouding
Hearts are hardening
And the result is murder
This age is grave bound
Likewise, its aging successors
Aging, all the while, descending
Developing an even more insatiable thirst for chaos
Life among hyenas and asps under vultures
That pick at the corpses of the fallen

And man will continue to suffer unto itself
Until some stand to rally the fray by firm example

Chaos must succumb to order
Lest these days be numbered

We will all dance

And put it to proper use.

Dare me to breathe

When I can't catch my breath.

",Whether to Cry or Destroy

As there is no more beauty left to alighten
What was once flourished has withered away
And what will not weather I cannot stomach
Oh the cruelty of a persistent scar

While I sever with regretful hands
The strings so carelessly attached to me
I can remove the litter of intimacy

How can that which breaks ever heal
This won't be the death of me

A man who has learned from his misery

Am I not a better man?
A clever man who taught his flesh the way of steel

Am I not a better man?
Or just a bitter man?
That rots with memories and only grows cold?
And indeed, I have grown cold

And this moment feels like the harshest end to the coldest day
This day has lasted a lifetime
With an eternity left to lapse

Here I am, forsaken

Well
You and I both know that the house is haunted
And you and I both know that the ghost is me
You used to catch me in your bed-sheets just a-rattling your chains
Well back then baby, it didn’t seem so strange

You used to bite, I used to moan
But now I’m mumbling and you choke
Well I ain’t so scary on my own
Tell me honey, what’s a dagger without a cloak?
Well I don't know

‘Cause
You and I both know that the house is haunted
Yeah you and I both know that the ghost is me
You used to catch me in your bed-sheets just a-rattling your chains
Well back then baby, it didn’t seem so strange

In the midnight hour, you came alive
I was looking for my crystal ball
I busy trying to charm that snake
When the sun came up we had no place to hide
And you had to tell your friends that my things where fake
I just had to

You and I both know that the house is haunted
Yeah you and I both know that the ghost is me
You used to catch me in your bed-sheets just a-rattling your chains
Well back then baby, it didn’t seem so strange

But even when one is dead and gone
It still take two to make a house a home
Well I’m as lonesome as the catacombs
I hear you call my name but no one's there
Except a new one in the air

You and I both know that the house is haunted
Yeah you and I both know that the ghost is me
You used to walk around screaming, all slamming all ‘dem doors
Well I’m all grown up now and I don’t scare easy no more

But you and I both know

Yeah you and I both know

Yeah you and I both know

And was playing soft

Through all kinds of weather, Lord

Shakin' Stevens,"I tore my letter up, couldn't even start 
To tell you what's really here in my heart 
There's only so much that words can say 
So I sent you a piece of this beautiful day 

Oh, I want you to know that I took a rainbow 
And sent it off in a letter to you 
Took some flowers in the spring, made a sweet clover ring 
And sent it off in a letter to you 
Took a song from the lark - the moon from the dark 
A spark with the sparkling dew 
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love 
I sent 'em off in a letter to you 

I took the mornin' sun, peekin' throgh the trees 
And the dandelion silk tangled in the breeze 
I folded 'em up - sealed 'em with a kiss 
It's the kind of letter that you can't resist

A spark with the sparkling dew 
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love 
I sent 'em off in a letter to you 

In a day or two - just you wait and see 
You're gonna get a special delivery 
You'll know the way I feel - there can't be any doubt

Keeps me sighin' baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me

I've given up my friends just for you

And you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back

Pump it up, when you don't really need it
Pump it up, until you can feel it

Listen to the propaganda, listen to the latest slander
There's nothing underhand that she wouldn't understand
Pump it up, until you can feel it
Pump it up, when you don't really need it

She's been a bad girl, she's like a chemical
Though you try to stop it, she's like a narcotic
You want to torture her, you want to talk to her
All the things you bought for her, putting up your temperature
Pump it up, until you can feel it
Pump it up, when you don't really need it

Out in the fashion show, down in the bargain bin
You put your passion out under the pressure pin
Fall into submission, hit-and-run transmission
No use wishing now for any other sin

Y es difícil creer que no exista una más
Que este amor
Sobra tanto
Dentro de este corazón
Que a pesar de que dicen
Que los años son sabios
Todavía se siente el dolor

Porque todo el tiempo que pasé junto a ti
Dejo tejido su hilo dentro de mi

Y aprendí a quitarle al tiempo los segundos
Tú mi hiciste ver el cielo aún más profundo
Junto a ti creo que aumenté más de 3 kilos
Con tus tantos dulces besos repartidos

Desarrollaste mi sentido del olfato
Y fue por ti que aprendí a querer los gatos
Despegaste del cemento mis zapatos
Para escapar los dos volando un rato

Pero olvidaste una final instrucción
Porque aún no sé como vivir sin tu amor

Y descubrí lo que significa una rosa
Me enseñaste decir mentiras piadosas
Para poder verte a horas no adecuadas
Y a reemplazar palabras por miradas

Y fue por ti que escribí más de 100 canciones
Y hasta perdoné tus equivocaciones
Y conocí más de mil formas de besar
Y fue por ti que descubrí lo que es amar

Entre el suelo y el cielo, mi cielo

Que la vida se me vuelve en ocho

Que no tardaras

En al abecedario
Debajo del carro
En el negro en el blanco

En cuadros de Botero
En mi monedero
En dos mil religiones

Si pudiera escaparme de tu nombre
Si pudiera arrancarme el corazón

Creo que alguna vez fui infiel
Juego mal hasta el parqués
Y jamás uso reloj

Y para ser más franca nadie
Piensa en ti como lo hago yo
Aunque te dé lo mismo

Si es cuestión de confesar
Nunca duermo antes de diez
Ni me baño los domingos
La verdad es que también
Lloro una vez al mes
Sobre todo cuando hay frío

Conmigo nada es fácil
Ya debes saber
Me conoces bien
Y sin ti todo es tan aburrido

El cielo está cansado ya de ver
La lluvia caer
Y cada día que pasa es uno más
Parecido a ayer
No encuentro forma a alguna de
Olvidarte porque
Seguir amándote es inevitable

Siempre supe que es mejor
Cuando hay que hablar de dos
Empezar por uno mismo
Ya sabrás la situación
Aquí todo está peor
Pero al menos aún respiro

No tienes que decirlo
No vas a volver
Te conozco bien
Ya buscaré qué hacer conmigo

El cielo está cansado ya de ver
La lluvia caer
Y cada día que pasa es uno más
Parecido a ayer
No encuentro forma a alguna de
Olvidarte porque
Seguir amándote es inevitable

Siempre supe que es mejor
Cuando hay que hablar de dos
Empezar por uno mismo",Inevitable

Tan largos tan grises
Mis días sin ti

Mis días sin ti son
Tan absurdos
Tan agrios tan duros
Mis días sin ti

Mis días sin ti
No tienen noches
Si alguna aparece es inútil
Dormir

Mis días sin ti son un derroche
Las horas no tienen principio ni fin

Tan faltos de aire
Tan llenos de nada
Chatarra inservible
Basura en el suelo
Moscas en la casa

Mis días sin ti son como un cielo
Sin lunas plateadas
Ni rastros de sol

Mis días sin ti son solo un eco
Que siempre repite la misma canción

Tan faltos de aire
Tan llenos de nada
Chatarra inservible
Basura en el suelo
Moscas en la casa

Pateando las piedras
Aún sigo esperando que vuelvas conmigo
Aún sigo buscando
En las caras de ancianos
Pedazos de niño

Cazando motivos que me hagan creer
Que aún me encuentro con vida,
Mordiendo mis uñas
Ahogándome en llanto
Extrañándote tanto

Mis días sin ti
Mis días sin ti
Mis días sin ti
Como duelen los días sin ti
Sin ti
Sin ti",Moscas en la Casa

Shakira,"El octavo día Dios después de tanto trabajar
Para liberar tensiones luego ya de revisar
Dijo todo esta muy bien es hora de descansar
Y se fue a dar un paseo por el espacio sideral

Quien se iba a imaginar que el mismo Dios al regresar
Iba a encontrarlo todo en un desorden infernal
Que se iba a convertir en un desempleado mas
De la tasa que anualmente esta creciendo sin parar

Desde ese entonces hay quienes lo han visto
Solo en las calles transitar
Anda esperando paciente por alguien
Con quien al menos tranquilo
Pueda conversar

Mientras tanto este mundo gira y gira sin poderlo detener
Y aquí abajo unos cuantos nos manejan
Como fichas de ajedrez
No soy la clase de idiota
Que se deja convencer
Pero digo la verdad
Y hasta un ciego lo puede ver

Si a falta de ocupación
O de excesiva soledad
Dios no resistiera mas
Y se marchara a otro lugar
Seria nuestra perdición
No habría otro remedio mas
Que adorar a Michael Jackson
A Bill Clinton o a Tarzan

Es mas dificil ser rey sin corona
Que una persona mas normal
Pobre de Dios que no sale en revistas
Que no es modelo ni artista o de familia real

Mientras tanto este mundo gira y gira

Y descubres que no se lava bien los dientes
Si te quita los pocos centavos que tienes

I still hear your seawinds blowing
I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawaves crashin
While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run

I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying
In the sun, at Galveston, at Galveston",Intro/Octavo Día

To church on Sundays
To plant more dreams

You're the one I need
The way back home is always long
But if you're close to me I'm holding on
You're the one I need

'Cause there's nothing like your smile made of sun

In the world full of strangers
You're the one I know

So I learned to cook and finally lose
My kitchen phobia
And so I got the arms to cuddle in
When there's a ghost or a muse
That brings insomnia
To buy more thongs
To write more happy songs
It always takes a little help from someone

And too high to see below
Just hangin' on your daily dose
I know you never needed anyone
But the rolling papers for your grass
How can you give what you don't have

You keep on aiming for the top
And quit before you sweat a drop
Feed your empty brain
With your hydroponic pot
Start out playing with yourself
You get more fun within your shell
Nice to meet you but I gotta go my way

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain
But you're so in love with yourself
If I say my heart is sore
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
So I won't repeat it no more

I rather eat my soup with a fork
Or drive a cab in New York
'Cause to talk to you is harder work

So what's the point of wasting all my words
If it's just the same or even worse
Than reading poems to a horse

You keep on aiming for the top
And quit before you sweat a drop
Feed your empty brain
With your hydroponic pot
I bet you'll find someone like you
'Cause there's a foot for every shoe
I wish you luck but I've other things to do

And never put aside
The things I'm gonna say
'Cause these are rules for us

Use your eyes only to look at me
Use your mouth only to kiss my lips
We are branches of the same old tree
You can laugh only if you laugh with me
You can cry only if you cry for me
Don't forget that you're condemned to me
Can't you see
You always were
You'll always be

You used to say
I should see a doctor
Who would keep me busy
'Cause a jealous woman
Never makes it easy
And I finally know what to do for us
Whatever seems right
But it may take a while
Before I change the rules

Use your eyes only to look at me
Use your mouth only to kiss my lips
We are branches of the same old tree
You can laugh only if you laugh with me
You can cry only if you cry for me
Don't forget that you're condemned to me
Can't you see
You always were
You always were

Use your eyes only to look at me
Use your mouth only to kiss my lips
We are branches of the same old tree
You can laugh only if you laugh with me
You can cry only if you cry for me
Don't forget that you're condemned to me

Shakira,"Suerte que en el sur hayas nacido
Y que burlemos las distancias
Suerte que es haberte conocido
Y por ti amar tierras extrañas
Yo puedo escalar los Andes solo
Por ir a contar tus lunares

Mis alegrías y mis males

Quiero vivir contigo
Contigo mi vida
Quiero vivir la vida
Y lo que me queda de vida
Quiero vivir contigo

Suerte que es tener labios sinceros
Para besarte con mas ganas
Suerte que mis pechos sean pequeños
Y nos los confundas con montañas
Suerte que herede las piernas firmes
Para correr si un día hace falta
Y estos dos ojos que me dicen
Que he de llorar cuando te vallas

Le ro lo le lo le

Sabes que estoy a tus pies

Shakira,"Si ya es hora de esconder
Del mundo el dolor
Bajo la piel
Más se que estaré bien
Los gatos como yo caen de pie
No quiero
Jugar mi suerte por ti
No puedo
Con V pequeña vivir
Pronto estaré de aquí
Muy muy lejos

Ay me voy otra vez
Ahí te dejo Madrid
Tus rutinas de piel
Y tus ganas de huir
Yo no quiero cobardes
Que me hagan sufrir
Mejor le digo adiós
A tu boca de anís

Si ya es hora de limpiar
Las manchas de miel
Sobre el mantel
Yo nunca supe actuar
Y mis labios se ven
Muertos de sed

No quiero dejarlo todo a lazar
Entiendo
Que he comenzado a estorbar
Pronto estaré de ti
Muy muy lejos

Ay me voy otra vez
Ahí te dejo Madrid

And someday think of kids 
Or maybe just to save a little money 

[Chorus]
You're the one I need 
The way back home is always long 
But if you're close to me I'm holding on 
You're the one I need 
My real life has just begun 
Cause there's nothing like your smile made of sun 

In the world full of strangers 
You're the one I know 

So I learned to cook and finally lose 
My kitchen phobia 
And so I got the arms to cuddle in 
When there's a ghost or a muse 
That brings insomnia 
To buy more thongs 
To write more happy songs 
It always takes a little help from someone 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
You're the one I need 
You're the one I need 

You're my (??) real life has just begun 
You're the one I need 
You're the one I need 

Nothing like your smile made of sun 
Nothing like your love
Nothing like your love
Nothing like your love",The One [Multimedia Track]
Shakira,"You're too far to bring you close
And too high to see below
Just hangin' on your daily dose 
I know you never needed anyone
But the rolling papers for your grass
How can you give what you don't have

You keep on aiming for the top
And quit before you sweat a drop
Feed your empty brain
With your hydroponic pot
Start out playing with yourself
You get more fun within your shell
Nice to meet you but I gotta go my way

I'll leave again `cause I've been waiting in vain
But you're so in love with yourself
If I say my heart is sore
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
So I won't repeat it no more

I rather eat my soup with a fork
Or drive a cab in New York
`Cause to talk to you is harder work

So what's the point of wasting all my words
If it's just the same or even worse
Than reading poems to a horse

You keep on aiming for the top
And quit before you sweat a drop
Feed your empty brain
With your hydroponic pot
I bet you'll find someone like you
`Cause there's a foot for every shoe
I wish you luck but I've other things to do

I'll leave again `cause I've been waiting in vain
But you're so in love with yourself
If I say my heart is sore
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
So I won't repeat it no more",Poem to a Horse [Multimedia Track]
Shakira,"I don't want to clear the cobwebs from my head
Time will bring them back I bet
So, if you hear me say that I believe in love
Don't make me feel ashamed
I used to sing the saddest songs
And while in the meantime roaches used to climb my door
Falling back down to the floor
I used to read survival guides
When my world was full of seven-legged cats
But here I am with eight more lives

I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Ready to get it on

I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You know it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You better not
Ignore it

I don't want to look at fashion magazines
While someone does my nails
Sitting here, watching other people live
Frozen by the fear to fail
'Cause everyday there's a war to fight
And if I win or lose, never mind
As long as you're my shelter every night
I used to cry against a wall
But now I've got a shoulder that I can lean on
Swear to me you won't be gone

I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Ready to get it on

Shakira,"Cuéntame que harás después que estrenes su cuerpo
Cuando muera tu traviesa curiosidad
Cuando memorices todos sus recovecos
Y decidas otra vez regresar
Ya no estaré aquí en el mismo lugar

Si no tiene más que un par de dedos de frente
Y descubres que no se lava bien los dientes
Si te quita los pocos centavos que tienes
Y luego te deja solo tal como quiere

Se que volverás el día
En que ella te haga trizas
Sin almohadas para llorar
Pero si estás decidido
Y no quieres mas conmigo

Por que sin ti el mundo ya me da igual

Shakira,"It's not her fault that she's so irresistible
But all the damage she's caused isn't fixable
Every twenty seconds you repeat her name
But when it comes to me you don't care

Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal
That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible
But you gotta know small things also count
You better put your feet on the ground
And see what it's about

So objection, I don't wanna be the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free and I'm not your mother
But you don't even bother

Objection, I'm tired of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way, I've got to run away

I wish you
(There was a chance for you and me)
I wish
(You couldn't find a place to be)
Away from here

This is pathetic and sardonic, it's sadistic and psychotic
Tango is not for three, was never meant to be
But you can try it, rehearse it or train like a horse
But don't you count on me, don't you count on me boy

So objection, I don't want to be the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free and I'm not your mother
But you don't even bother

Objection, I'm tired of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way, I've got to get away
Get away, get away
Eh, eh, eh, get away

I beat her at that one good

And lose those pounds, and learn about football
If it made you stay, but you won't, but you won't

Y que dulce sensación

Y ahora que andamos por el mundo
Como eneas y benitin
Ya te encontré varios rasguños
Que te hicieron por ahí

Es tu mejor doctor

Voy a curarte el alma en duelo
Voy a dejarte como nuevo
Y todo va a pasar
Pronto verás el sol brillar

Ya vas a ver como van sanando
Poco a poco tus heridas
Ya vas a ver como va
La misma vida a decantar la sal que sobra del mar

Y aunque hayas sido un extranjero
Hasta en tu propio país
Si yo te digo ¿qué dices tu?
Tu aún dices ¿que decís?
Y lloras de emoción oyendo un bandoneón

Y aunque parezcas despistado con ese caminar pausado
Conozco la razón que hace doler tu corazón
Por eso quise hacerte esta canción

Ya vas a ver como van sanando

Ya vas a ver como va

Prefiero darle fin

No pido que todos los viernes sean de fiesta

Ay amor me duele tanto
Me duele tanto
Que te fueras sin decir a donde
Ay amor, fue una tortura perderte

Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar amor

No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo

Solo de errores se aprende
Y hoy se que es tuyo mi corazón

Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso
Y nos decimos adiós

Esto es otra vez esto es otra vez no

No puedo pedir que el invierno perdone a un rosal
No puedo pedir a los olmos que entreguen peras
No puedo pedirle lo eterno a un simple mortal
Y andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas

Ay amor me duele tanto
Me duele tanto
Que no creas más en mis promesas

Es una tortura

No te bajes, no te rajes
Oye negrita mira, no te rajes
De lunes a viernes tienes mi amor
Déjame el sábado a mi que es mejor
Oye mi negra no me castigues más
Porque allá afuera sin ti no tengo paz
Yo solo soy un hombre arrepentido
Soy como el ave que vuelve a su nido

Yo se que no he sido un santo
Y es que no estoy hecho de cartón

No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo

Solo de errores se aprende

Los han visto en los tejados
Dando vueltas en Paris
Condenando en los juzgados

De corbata o de blue jeans

Sin mas nada que decir

Donde están los ladrones
Donde esta el asesino

En el patio del vecino
Y que pasa si son ellos
Y que pasa si soy yo
El que toca esta guitarra
O la que canta esta canción
La que canta esta canción

Los han visto de rodillas
Sentados o de cuclillas
Parados dando lecciones
En todas las posiciones
Predicando en las iglesias
Hasta ofreciendo conciertos
Los han visto en los cócteles todos
Repartiendo ministerios

A tus negocios sucios
Ya sabes que estoy de ti vacunada
A prueba de patadas
Por ti me quedé como Mona Lisa
Sin llanto y sin sonrisa
Que el cielo y tu madre cuiden de ti
Me voy, será mejor así

Sé que olvidarte no es asunto sencillo

No sé como se puede ya vivir
Pero era así

Es tan patético, neurótico, satírico, psicótico
Tú no lo ves, el tango no es de tres, llevo planeando escapar
Y me sale al revés pero voy a intentarlo una y otra vez

Shakira,"Why do all my friends now want to be your lovers?
Your family got bigger when they thought you were rich
And now like maniacs
They scratch your back

I want to save you from
Save you from all that's vain
Save you from the things that cause us pain

Some are ready to bite you, my love

They believe you now have everything you wanted
And once you have become a star
You've got no right to bitch
But someday when you fail
They'll put you on sale
And buy you by the inch

But you're the real deal
And 'real' is your middle name
You know, sometimes I feel
Got to earn every breath we take, baby
Never mind the rules we break

So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to bite you

It's an animal city
It's a cannibal world
So be obedient, don't argue
Some are ready to rip you right off

With you I feel safe
There's nothing to fear from us
Away from the fangs, the fangs of the world
I may be a coward, but you are brave
And nothing seems so dangerous

Promises I made to you went down the sink

And I don't always smell like strawberries and cream

When we were dreaming easy
Fresh as limes and happy as a Sunday sky
There was nothing we could sell or buy
'Cause all we really needed
Was our bare feet and a pair of wings to fly

What do you think, darling?
Have we lived too much, too fast?
And have you
Have you felt melancholy, darling
Wishing that time hadn't passed?

Can you tell me how it used to be?
Have we missed our chance?
Have we changed our hopes for fears and our dreams for plans?

Can you tell me how it used to be
When we really cared?
And when love was on our side
On our side

I remember all the times before
When we could spend our evening
Staring at the ceiling, lying on the floor
My vocabulary wasn't broad
I spoke so little English
And the word ""stress"" would sound like something odd

Have I lived too much, too fast?
And have you
Have you felt the melancholy, darling

Have we changed our hopes for fears and our dreams for plans?
Can you tell me how it used to be

Have I lived too much, too fast?
So if you
If you ever come and find me crying
Now you know, now you know why

Any suggestions?
Don't have to tell you more than that
'Cause no one knows me like you do
Without exception

This house is full of emptiness
My closet's full of dresses that I'll never wear
My life is full of people
But you're my only friend and my best friend

Hope it isn't too late to say I love you
Hope it isn't too late to say 
That without you this place looks like London, it rains everyday
Don't you know it babe, I'm only half a body
Without your embrace

Hope it isn't too late to say I love you
Hope it isn't too late to say
That without you this place looks like London, it rains everyday

No pido que todos los días sean de sol
No pido que todos los viernes sean de fiesta
Tampoco te pido que vuelvas rogando perdón
Si lloras con los ojos secos
Y hablando de ella

Ay amor me duele tanto
Me duele tanto
Que te fueras sin decir a donde
Ay amor, fue una tortura perderte

Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar amor

No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo

Solo de errores se aprende
Y hoy se que es tuyo mi corazón

Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso
Y nos decimos adiós

Esto es otra vez esto es otra vez no

No puedo pedir que el invierno perdone a un rosal
No puedo pedir a los olmos que entreguen peras
No puedo pedirle lo eterno a un simple mortal
Y andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas

Porque allá afuera sin ti no tengo paz
Yo solo soy un hombre arrepentido
Soy como el ave que vuelve a su nido

Shakira,"Para amarte necesito una razón
Y es difícil creer que no exista una más
Que este amor
Sobra tanto
Dentro de este corazón
Que a pesar de que dicen
Que los años son sabios
Todavía se siente el dolor

Porque todo el tiempo que pasé junto a ti
Dejo tejido su hilo dentro de mi

Y aprendí a quitarle al tiempo los segundos
Tú mi hiciste ver el cielo aún más profundo
Junto a ti creo que aumenté más de 3 kilos
Con tus tantos dulces besos repartidos

Desarrollaste mi sentido del olfato
Y fue por ti que aprendí a querer los gatos
Despegaste del cemento mis zapatos
Para escapar los dos volando un rato

Pero olvidaste una final instrucción
Porque aún no sé como vivir sin tu amor

Y descubrí lo que significa una rosa
Me enseñaste decir mentiras piadosas
Para poder verte a horas no adecuadas
Y a reemplazar palabras por miradas

Y fue por ti que escribí más de 100 canciones
Y hasta perdoné tus equivocaciones
Y conocí más de mil formas de besar
Y fue por ti que descubrí lo que es amar
Lo que es amar",Antología [DVD]
Shakira,"Te conocí un día de enero
Con la luna en mi nariz
Y como vi que eras sincero
En tus ojos me perdí

Que torpe distracción
Y que dulce sensación

Y ahora que andamos por el mundo
Como eneas y benitin
Ya te encontré varios rasguños
Que te hicieron por ahí

Pero mi loco amor
Es tu mejor doctor

Voy a curarte el alma en duelo
Voy a dejarte como nuevo
Y todo va a pasar
Pronto verás el sol brillar

Tú más que nadie merece ser feliz

Ya vas a ver como van sanando
Poco a poco tus heridas
Ya vas a ver como va
La misma vida a decantar la sal que sobra del mar

Y aunque hayas sido un extranjero
Hasta en tu propio país
Si yo te digo ¿qué dices tu?
Tu aún dices ¿que decís?
Y lloras de emoción oyendo un bandoneón

Y aunque parezcas despistado con ese caminar pausado
Conozco la razón que hace doler tu corazón
Por eso quise hacerte esta canción

Ya vas a ver como van sanando
Poco a poco tus heridas
Ya vas a ver como va
La misma vida a decantar la sal que sobra del mar

Shakira,"Eres como una predicción de las buenas 
Eres como una dosis alta en las venas

Por que mi amor por ti es total 
Y es para siempre

Debajo el asfalto 
Y más abajo estaría yo 

Después de ti la pares 
No me faltes nunca 
Debajo el asfalto

Sin ti

Y ya me has convertido 
En tu perro faldero 
Sabes que sin ti 
Ya yo no soy 
Sabes que a donde vayas voy

Shakira,"Nunca usé un antifaz
Voy de paso
Por este mundo fugaz

No pretendo parar
¿Dime quién camina
Cuando se puede volar?

Mi destino es andar
Mis recuerdos
Son una estela en el mar

Lo que tengo, lo doy
Digo lo que pienso
Tómame como soy

Y va liviano
Mi corazón gitano
Que solo entiende de latir
A contramano
No intentes amarrarme
Ni dominarme
Yo soy quien elige
Como equivocarme

Aprovechame
que si llegué ayer
Me puedo ir mañana
Que soy gitana
Que soy gitana

Sigo siendo aprendiz
En cada beso
Y con cada cicatriz

Algo pude entender
De tanto que tropiezo
Ya sé como caer

Y va liviano
Mi corazón gitano
Que solo entiende de latir
A contramano
No intentes amarrarme
Ni dominarme
Yo soy quien elige
Como equivocarme

Aprovechame
Que si llegué ayer
Me puedo ir mañana
Que soy gitana

Vamos y vemos
Que la vida es un goce
Es normal que le temas
A lo que no conoces

Tómame y vamos
Que la vida es un goce
Es normal que le temas
A lo que no conoces
Quiero verte volar
Quiero verte volar

Y va liviano
Mi corazón gitano
Que solo entiende de latir
A contramano
No intentes amarrarme
Ni dominarme
Yo soy quien elige
Como equivocarme

Aprovechame
Que si llegué ayer
Me puedo ir mañana
Que soy gitana",Gitana
Shakira,"S.O.S. she's in disguise
S.O.S. she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

A domesticated girl that's all you ask of me
Darling it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

I've been devoting myself to you Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused like a coffee machine in an office
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you all about it

There's a she wolf in your closet
Open up and set her free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student

To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys that just want to enjoy
But having a very good time and behave very bad in the arms of a boy

There's a she wolf in the closet

Azufre revuelto con miel

No da consejos ni los escucha

Si acaso me meto en aprietos tambien llevo el número de los bomberos
Ni tipos muy lindos, ni divos, ni niños ricos, yo se lo que quiero

A politician
Need everyone's approval just to see if you are doing right

And I hope you both freeze under the Eiffel Tower
So you end up throwing in the towel

Hope you'll miss me

That I put my trust in you

Sabe Dios, cómo me cuesta dejarte
Y te miro mientras duermes, más no voy a despertarte
Es que hoy se me agotó la esperanza
Porque con lo que nos queda de nosotros ya no alcanza

Eres lo que más he querido
En la vida lo que mas he querido
Eres lo que más he querido en la vida
Lo que más he querido

Cuántas veces quise hacerlo bien
Y pequé por hablar demasiado
No saber dónde, cómo, ni cuándo
Todos estos años caminando juntos
Ahora no parecen tanto

Sabe Dios, todo el amor que juramos
Pero hoy nada es lo mismo
Ya no vamos a engañarnos
Es que soy, una mujer en el mundo
Que hizo todo lo que pudo
No te olvides ni un segundo

Que eres lo que más he querido
En la vida lo que más he querido
Eres lo que más he querido en la vida
Lo que más he querido",Lo Que Más
Shakira,"Mariposas vuelan a destiempo
Coloriendo el cielo de abril
Vuelan muy alto donde el viento lo decida
Ni los años ni los contratiempos
Nada me separa de ti
Contigo me quedo
Y me quedo de por vida

Ya pateamos las piedras del camino
El universo es mesquino
Comparado con lo que me das

Voy a insistir sin descansar
Es una historia sin final
Mi amor es sobrenatural

Oh oh ah ah ah ah
Oh oh ah ah ah ah

Mariposas cuando estoy contigo
Vuelan de mi ombligo hasta ti
Son tantas cosas las que harás nacer en mi
Quiero que mi vientre sea nido
Siembra tu ternura en mi
Son tantas cosas las que haré crecer en ti

Caminando hicimos el camino
Que hasta el futuro adivino
Yo no doy puntada sin dedal

Voy a insistir sin descansar
Es una historia sin final
Mi amor es sobrenatural
Voy a insistir sin descansar
Es una historia sin final

Shakira,"Y yo que hasta ayer solo fuí un holgazán
Y hoy soy el guardián de sus sueños de amor

La quiero a morir

Pueden destrozar todo aquello que ven
Porque ella en un soplo lo vuelve a crear
Como si nada, como si nada

La quiero a morir

Ella para las horas de cada reloj
Y me ayuda a pintar transparente el dolor
Con su sonrisa

Y levanta una torre desde el cielo hasta aquí
Y me coce unas alas y me ayuda a subir
A toda prisa, a toda prisa

La quiero a morir

Conoce bien cada guerra
Cada herida, cada ser
Conoce bien cada guerra
De la vida y del amor también

Moi je n'étais rien et voilà qu'aujourd'hui
Je suis le gardien du sommeil de ses nuits

Je l'aime à mourir

Vous pouvez détruire tout ce qu'il vous plaira
Elle n'a qu'à ouvrir l'espace de ses bras
Pour tout reconstruire, pour tout reconstruire

Je l'aime à mourir

Elle a gommé les chiffres des horloges du quartier
Elle a fait de ma vie des cocottes en papier
Des éclats de rire

Elle a bâti des ponts entre nous et le ciel
Et nous les traversons à chaque fois qu'elle
Ne veut pas dormir, ne veut pas dormir

Je l'aime à mourir

Elle a dû faire toutes les guerres

Shakira,"Everybody needs an anchor
A little something that makes you stay
An incentive
Someone to fight for
Cause no one really needs so much space
A couple years ago I was lonely
I used to think that there was no God
But then you looked at me with your blue eyes
And my agnosticism turned into dust
How well you know me
That I don’t care if the rest don’t
It doesn’t matter to me, no
As long as you love me
As long as we still have each other

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
And I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
'Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23

God knows that I’m a good dancer
My feet can move to the music he plays
But there were times I asked for an answer
When he was acting in mysterious ways

There were nights that I stayed up crying
'Cause I was certain that things wouldn't change
But then you came and I saw you smiling
Just like an angel, so beautifully strange

And then you touched me
It's like you were made for me, oh
Like it was all meant to be, oh
And I was sure that you would love me
And that we'd always have each other

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
And I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey, do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
'Cause I do, as I did then
When you were only 23

Always thought that I was fine but I was wrong
It was you, that one piece I was missing
And I could do without you but it'd be no fun
I found you and life was suddenly easy
There ain't no worries now
There ain't no feeling down

I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
And I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey, do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
'Cause I do, as I did then
When you were only 23",23
Shakira,"I'm older but you're wiser than anyone can see
Your patient like no other has even been with me
Your eyes take me to places
I'd never dreamt about
Your voice is the only music I can't do without

There can't be any doubts now
We're just too far ahead to look behind
And above the good and bad

I need you to believe in my word
I feel like a broken record
And I've told you 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
My search is done

Can you put your trust in my word
I sound like a broken record
And I've said it 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
You are the one

Your hands that have no mercy
Are also my best friends
And I can get lost climbing on your legs that never end
I found a perfect distance between my body on you
And that is no distance, dear if that's alright with you
They said we wouldn't make it
But look at how we've beating all the odds
I just need you to be aware of that

I need you to believe in my word
I feel like a broken record
And I've told you 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
My search is done

Can you put your trust in my word
I sound like a broken record
And I've told you 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
You are the one

I just want you to take a leap of faith
No it's easy to make all the same mistakes
But I won't this time, no, not this time

I need you to believe in my word
I sound like a broken record
And I've said it 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
You are the one

A dozen icy summers were leading me to you
I had to hear the liars to recognize the truth
Remember the first Christmas
It almost seemed untrue
You promised that you'd always be with me
And I promised too",Broken Record
Shakira,"Why do you say things if you do not mean them?
Why do you fill up my wounds with your dirt?

And now I can't sleep
'Cause I'll never heal

Banging my head up against the wall
Staring at nothing cause I can't sleep at night
Can't make it stop, yeah I think too much
What do I do? Falling apart
I need a shock straight to my heart
No one would want to be in my shoes right now, oh

I don't reach for the bottle of whisky
Straight on the rocks
But you won't see me popping the pills
Po-po-popping the pills
Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my medicine, medicine
My medicine, medicine
My medicine

You know you're an expert at complicating things
That's how I'm wired, believe me it's no fun
But you make the war seem like such an easy game
Keeps me and my arguments come under
Down in the trenches, you are the white flag
Make me surrender
Want you so bad
Baby don't stop what you started
Don't ever be done, oh

I always throw the bottle of whisky
Straight on the rocks
But you won't see me popping the pills
Po-po-popping the pills
Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my medicine, medicine

Casi convencida que intentarlo es inútil

No es un daño de la percepción
Tampoco falta de sentido común

El mundo lo sabe, no es ningún tabú

Lo que me hace extrañarte así cuando no estás
Lo que me hace idolatrarte así, es todo tú
Estoy perdida, vivo anclada casi como un pájaro a su cielo azul

Morado, ya me olvidé del pasado
En rojo, por que me sangran los ojos de llorarte
Cuando no estás a mi lado

Dorado, por que no pienso perderte

Y me muero por tenerte
 
Es delicioso verte llegar
Ver los efectos que causas, tú
Con tu sonrisa angelical llenas la habitación de luz
Solo en ti encuentro satisfacción
Hay tanto por descubrir aún
Es todo una dulce confusión
Y tu piel es la plenitud

Yo tengo miedo de que me guste
Y que vaya a enloquecer

Aquí estás
Ya no puedes detenerte
¿Dónde vas? (¡Oh!)

Shakira,"En el cómputo global de las cosas si debemos hacer un recuento
No me dejas ser infeliz a pesar de mis intentos
Eres como un querubín que vuela y vuela y vuela
Cantando canciones de amor cerca de mí aunque me duela

Es el sol detrás de tu risa
Que me ciega y me deslumbra
Y tu piel que roza la mía
Pero aún no se acostumbra
Es la luz detrás de tus ojos
Que ilumina mi penumbra
Y que va brillando más fuerte y soy feliz, muy feliz

Y me das toneladas masivas de amor
No dejas un respiro a mi corazón
Tú me armas, me desarmas
Nunca me dejas caer
Tan bajo me levantas

Para mí este mundo sin tí no sería más que un mal invento
Una pésima combinación de mucho estrés y aburrimiento
Y si no fuera por ti, habría renunciado a mis sueños
Y si no fuera por ti, iría como un perro sin dueño

Es el sol detrás de tu risa
Que me ciega y me deslumbra
Y tu piel que roza la mía
Pero aún no se acostumbra
Solo tú con media palabra
Me construyes o me derrumbas
Junto a ti me siento mas fuerte y soy feliz, muy feliz

Y me das toneladas masivas de amor
No dejas un respiro a mi corazón
Tú me armas, me desarmas
Nunca me dejas caer
Tan bajo me levantas
Toneladas masivas de amor
No dejas un respiro a mi corazón
Tú me armas, me desarmas
Nunca me dejas caer
Tan bajo me levantas",Toneladas

Seek the darkest place in your soul
Face the reason and you will

Or the winter will be long

When the leaves are falling
Take good care
Be careful what you do
When the leaves are falling
It could be they cover everything around the tree

Through the valleys of your heart
And there's no one who can
Show you where to go

I will never give up
Do the best I can

“Wanna climb a ladder, gotta start from the ground
There is never a straight road but I’m sure there’s a path

ev'rytime I hear our favorite song, now you're gone, left this emptiness,

make romance to the music,

o help me out of this situation,
Now, when you're ill you take a pill,
When you're thirsty, drink your fill,
What you gonna do, oh yeah, 
when love gets a hold, a hold on you,
Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart, 
And, baby, I can't scratch it.
 
Love is a nagging irritation, 
Causing my heart complication,
Love is a growing infection,
And I don't know the correction, 
Got me rocking and a-reeling,
And I can't shake the feeling.
Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart,
tearing it all apart,
Just an Itching in my heart,
And, baby, I can't scratch it.

In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son

That me dad is always broke

I'll still have a laugh anyway

But I know they never will
And eating my bloody breakfast
Won't change the way I feel
They talk about the old days
The things they never had
Well that was yesteryear mum
And this is today dad

In the night, realm of dreams
Wildness creeps, descending
All so quiet, all so still
Prowling silence in the night

In the heights, on the peaks
Rainy clouds surrounding
There are cities made of light
Ripping though the black of night

All becomes so real
Making dreams come true
To release your mind and free your soul

Fly away from this land
Made of old scraps of sorrow
No way back, free to ride
Hesitation... sacrifice

Mesmerize, hold on tight
For the heavens bend down
There's a tunnel, long and winding
Leading on towards the light

All becomes so real
Making dreams come true
To release your mind and free your soul

Free yourself from misery, let go
Hear my voice and
I will guide your roaming

Oh, free yourself from misery let go
Hear my voice and I will light your road
Leave behind the world you know, and float
Hear my voice and I will guide your roaming

Look around, what do you see
Caugh up in humility?
Too many souls are on their own
Fallen angels moving on

There's more to get, more to find
Feelings of another kind
The chice is set, take it soon
For even you won't be immune now

I'd count it a miracle
If I ever see your smile
Throw away your illusions, dear
Don't keep trusting your own lies

Who's in command of your heart
Of your hope?
Past thoughts are vague
As they soar high and low

Yet someday, still alive
You will find a will to strive
For someone else will come along
To lift you up, to right the wrong

And you will see within your eyes
Figures that comes back to life
You'll touch the wounds that never heal
Love is raw, it's not for real

I'd count it a miracle
If I ever see your smile
Throw away your illusions, dear
Let me hold you for a while

Who's in command of your heart, of your hope?
Past thoughts are vague, running out of control

There was a time when the fields were green
The world was one, life was filled with something
There was a blue sea, on the horizon
There was a dream of a lasting fire
We bottomed out, life's become so cruel
Along the way, a regardless torment
Is there a cause that we would die for?
Is there a place where the spirit lives on?

Who's in command of your heart, of your hope?
Past thoughts are vague, running out of control
There's more to know and there's much more beyond
The faith that you've lost you will find on your own

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Shane Fontayne,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me

I'm just sayin' what is real
And I'm just saying how I feel
When I'm with you I'm on top of the world.
Could you, could you be my girl?
I get the chills on the warmth of this day
When I'm with you you take my breath away.
Walk with me, talk with me, and stay with me
And when they drop the beat,
Dance with me.

I get nervous when I'm talking to you,
But on the dance floor you know I can come through
I know how to lay it down.
Listen to the sound, baby let your body hit the ground.

Woah oh, dance with me

Well I've danced before with other girls,
But none like this.
I've moved to the rhythm a thousand times,

I suppose I should have begged with her to stay

And Oh! Daddy didn't like my hair

Smiling proud and young
Around the hemp, around his neck

And young Roddy McCorley goes to die
On the bridge of Tuam today

Shining steel in hand
Behind him marched in gray array
A stalwart earnest band
For Antrim town, for Antrim town
He lept into the fray

On the bridge of Tuam today

See the host of fleet foot men
Dismayed with faces wan
From Verners house and fishers cut
Along the banks of Bann

My way across the sea
James Mangan brought me comfort
With laudnum and poitin
He flew me back to Dublin
In 1819
To a public execution
Being held on Stephen's Green
The young man on the platform
Held his head up and he did sing
Then he whispered hard into my ear
As he handed me this ring

""If you miss me on the harbour
For the boat, it leaves at three
Take this snake with eyes of garnet
My mother gave to me!

This snake cannot be captured
This snake cannot be tied
This snake cannot be tortured, or
Hung or crucified

It belongs to you and me
So pass it on and pass it on
'Till all mankind is free

If you miss me on the harbour
For the boat, it leaves at three
Take this snake with eyes of garnet

A roar came from the crowd

With a lady proud and fair
So passionate were she and I
We made fire in the air
I loved her more than life itself
She loved me just the same
And it broke my heart
To think we'd part if she ended the affair

But I was brutal, I was ignorant
I was cruel I was brash
I never gave a damn about
The beauty that I smashed
No sadist I, I took delight
In making my Love cry
Now I'd pray for a single kiss from her
To be lashed and crucified

And now I feel this lady fair
Can never more be mine
Long gone are night in my lonely bed
All suffering and crying
And though I fear that through this life
She'll only call me friend
Til I'm dead and buried in my grave
My Love will never end",The Song With No Name

The Angel of the East is calling
And with a trembling hand
I open up a can

Before I open up my eyes
I can feel her love inside me
But then I realize
My girl with green eyes
Is no longer there beside me

With a fat monk singing Gloria

Thought about you as the tune

To drown myself in you
Surround myself safe in your arms

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
'Tis I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so

But if you come, and all the flowers are dying
If I am dead, as dead I may well be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an ""Ave"" there for me

And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me
And all my grave shall warm and sweeter be
If you will bend and tell me that you love me
Then I will sleep in peace until you come to me",Danny Boy

Shane MacGowan,"And now the end is near, and so I face the final curtain,
My friend, I'll say it clear,
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.
I've lived a life that's full, I traveled each and every highway,
And more, much more than this, I did it my way.

Regrets I have a few, but then again, too few to mention,
I did what I had to do, and saw it through' without exception,
I planned each chartered course,
Each careful step along the by-way.
And more, much more than this, I did it my way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew,
When I bit off more than I could chew,
But through' it all, when there was doubt,
I ate it up, and spit it out.
I faced it all and I stood tall, and did it my way.

I've loved, I've laughed and cried, I've had my fill,
My share of losing, and now, as tears subside,
I find it all so amusing.
To think I did all that, and may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh no not me, I did it my way.

For what is a man, what has he got,
If not himself, then he has not
To say the things he truly feels,
And not the words of one who kneels,
The record shows I took the blows, and did it my way",My Way

I missed the London Irish girls 
But especially missed you 
The USA never fails to make me blue

And all the fuckin' bastards that drink trendy Irish beers 
My death squads would be kids from flats 
All high from sniffing glue 
I'd use them to kill rich Brits

Are drinking in the park 
And the junkies are still sneaking

And Jock laid out on his park bench

When I've done my patriotic chore 
And burnt London to the ground 
I'll go back home to Nenagh 
And get pissed every night in town 
Like the ol' folks say, 
You can't keep a good man down 

And the park bench Aristocrats 
Still drinking in the park

Tended everyday,
I'm an old dog, hard to love,
And even harder to change.

But it's no time to be slowing down,
It's no time to be turning 'round,

I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make

Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

songs come on my radio

some are fast and some are slow

some about sunshine some about rain

but to this old heart they sound the same

even though love notes and words might change


They're all about you

those kisses underneath the stars...you

those angel eyes and open arms...you

they're all about you


Layin at night in this big old bed

a million thoughts run through my head

sometimes I can't even sleep

your memory won't let me be

even if I drift off to dream


They're all about you

I close my eyes and all I see is you

She's there, I say
Please share my umbrella

Under my umbrella 

All that summer we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella we employed it
By August she was mine 

Every morning I would see her
Waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop
And she would show me what she'd bought 

Other people stared
As if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same 

That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinking of our sweet romance
Beginning in a dew

No more sheltering now

I could take love or leave it alone
That's how you get when you're hurt to the bone
One too many times
I had this heart of mine locked away
I kept my guard up night an' day
I had enough of the games they play
Out there on the line

It was the crime of the century
You played Robin Hood an' rescued me

Ain't got nothin' on you
You came on like Jesse James
You stole my heart like you were robbin' trains
I'm gonna lock you up for life with me
It was the crime of the century

You stacked the deck, you didn't gamble at all
You knew exactly how the cards would fall
You bet your heart, but as I recall
I didn't even stand a chance
I bet you had an ace up your sleeve
An' here I thought that you were so naive
You took my hand an' made me believe
In love an' real romance

It was the crime of the century
You played Robin Hood an' rescued me

Shania Twain,"Well he shines like a penny in a little kid's hand
When he's out on a Saturday night
He's a real go-getter and the best two-stepper you'll see
But when I'm sittin' alone at a table for two
Cause he's already out on the floor
I think about somethin' that my mama used to say to me

You got to dance with the one that brought you
Stay with the one that want's you
The one who's gonna love you when all of the others go home
Don't let the green grass fool you
Don't let the moon get to you
Dance with the one that brought you and you can't go wrong

He's got his old best buddies and his new best friends
And all the girls give him the eye
He's a good time Charlie and the life of the party tonight
But when I think about another well I don't think twice
Cause there'll never be another like him
I know he really loves me and I think maybe mama was right

But I'm over the storm

But that lonely ache in my heart
Ain't as bad as it used to be

Inside doesn't show
But I know
I'll get over you, I've just got a long way to go

And he found a part of me I could not hide
And we'd walk and talk and touch tenderly
Then he'd lay me down and make love to me

We built a love so strong it couldn't break
There was not a road we were afraid to take
And we'd kiss all the way from Arkansas to Rome
'Cause in each other's arms we were home sweet home

But he don't feel the same
Since our lives became
Years of bills, babies and chains

Home ain't where his heart is anymore
He may hang his hat behind our bedroom door
But he don't lay his head down to love me like before
Home ain't where his heart is anymore

If foundations made of stone can turn to dust
Then the hardest hearts of steel can turn to rust
If he could only find that feeling once again
If we could only change the way the story ends

And he may still come home
But I live here alone
The love that built these walls is gone

Home ain't where his heart is anymore
He may hang his hat behind our bedroom door
But he don't lay his head down to love me like before

Can't we just start
All over again?

And put them back where they belong

Stop draggin' me around
And if cryin' is the only way into your heart
Then leavin' is the only way out

And we've opened wounds we can't mend
And one night lonely is one night too many
Don't want to wake up to one more night that won't end

So slow down your horses
Stop draggin' me around
And if cryin' is the only way into your heart
Then leavin' is the only way out

When late nights and long lies came knockin'
You just invited them in
And our voices got too loud for talkin'
Then my heart hit the floor
But your feet just kept walkin'

And if cryin' is the only way you hear me hurtin'
For the lovin' that I can't live without
And if lovin' ain't the only way into your heart
Then leavin' is the only way out

Oh, leavin' is the only way out",Leaving Is the Only Way Out
Shania Twain,"Am I dreamin' or stupid?
I think I've been hit by cupid
But no one needs to know right now

I met a tall, dark and handsome man
And I've been busy makin' big plans
But no one needs to know right now

I got my heart set, my feet wet
And he don't even know it yet
But no one needs to know right now

I'll tell him someday some way somehow
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now

I want bells to ring, a choir to sing
The white dress the guests the cake the car the whole darn thing
But no one needs to know right now

I'll tell him someday some way somehow
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now

We'll have a little girl a little boy
A little Benji we call Leroy
And no one needs to know right now

And I'm not lonely anymore at night
And he don't know only, only he can make it right

And I'm not lonely anymore at night
And he don't know only, only he can make it right

I'm not dreamin' or stupid
But boy have I been hit by cupid
But no one needs to know right now

No one, no one, no one needs to know right now
No one, no one, no one needs to know oh oh right now",No One Needs to Know
Shania Twain,"Remember me as the way I was
The way I'd make you late for work
I had to hold you, just because

Remember you the way you'd wake me up
To love me once again
We were lovers, we were friends

But was I chasin' rainbows
Blinded by the sun
And did I take for granted
I'd be the only one?

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love

Remember when, just to feel my touch
Was all you ever needed
Oh it used to be enough

Remember when love
Was a promise we would give our lives to keep
And no river ran as deep

Was I chasin' rainbows
Blinded by the sun
And did I take for granted
I'd be the only one?

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love

I was taking all the love you had to give
But I was too lost in life to know
That without my love in return you could not live
Now she gives the love I did not show

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love",Raining on Our Love
Shania Twain,"Whose bed have your boots been under?

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal I wonder?
This time did it feel like thunder, baby?
Whose bed have your boots been under?

Don't look so lonely, don't act so blue
I know I'm not the only girl you run to
I know about Lolita, your little Spanish flame
I've seen you around with Rita, the redhead down the lane

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal I wonder?
This time did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?

And whose lips have you been kissin'?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missin', baby?
Well whose bed have your boots been under?

I heard you've been sneakin' around with Jill
And what about that weekend with Beverly Hill
And I've seen you walkin' with long legs Louise
And you weren't just talkin' last night with Denise

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal I wonder?
This time did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?

And whose lips have you been kissin'?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missin', baby?
Well whose bed have your boots been under?

Come on boots
Oh yeah
Bring it boys

So next time you're lonely don't call on me
Try the operator, maybe she'll be free

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal I wonder?
This time did it feel like thunder?

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal I wonder?
And this time did it feel like thunder, baby?

Shania Twain,"I'm not always strong
And sometimes I'm even wrong
But I win when I choose
And I can't stand to lose

But I can't always be
The rock that you see
When the nights get too long
And I just can't go on

The woman in me
Needs you to be
The man in my arms
To hold tenderly
'Cause I'm a woman in love
And it's you I run to
Yeah the woman in me
Needs the man in you

When the world wants too much
And it feels cold and out of touch
It's a beautiful place
When you kiss my face

The woman in me
Needs you to be
The man in my arms
To hold tenderly
'Cause I'm a woman in love
And it's you I run to

Blue tears, gimme freedom

Positively never goin' back
I won't live where things are so out of whack
No more rollin' with the punches
No more usin' or abusin'

I'd rather die standing
Than live on my knees
Begging please, no more

Black eyes, I don't need 'em

Definitely found my self esteem
Finally, I'm forever free to dream

Shania Twain,"You're so complicated, you hang over my shoulder
When I read my mail
I don't appreciate it
When I talk to other guys
You think they're on my tail

I get so aggravated when I get off the phone
And I get the third degree
I'm really feelin' frustrated
Why don't you take a pill and put a little trust in me
And you'll see

Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax

Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you

I'm crazy 'bout you (I'm crazy 'bout you)
So don't be stupid, you know I love you

Stop overreacting
You even get suspicious when I paint my nails
It's definitely distracting
The way you dramatize every little small detail

Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you

From this moment you are the one
Right beside you is where I belong
From this moment on

From this moment I have been blessed
I live only for your happiness
And for your love I'd give my last breath
From this moment on

I give my hand to you with all my heart
Can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you

From this moment as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment on

You're the reason I believe in love
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us

Shania Twain,"The car won't start, it's falling apart
I was late for work and the boss got smart
My panty line shows, got a run in my hose
My hair went flat-man, I hate that

Just when I thought things couldn't get worse
I realized I forgot my purse
With all this stress, I must confess
This could be worse than PMS

This job ain't worth the pay
Can't wait 'til the end of the day
Honey, I'm on my way
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day
Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way
Rub my feet, gimme something to eat
Fix me up my favorite treat
Honey, I'm back, my head's killing me
I need to relax and watch TV
Get off the phone, give the dog a bone
Hey! Hey! Honey, I'm home!

I broke a nail opening the mail
I cursed out loud 'cause it hurt like hell
This job's a pain, it's so mundane
It sure don't stimulate my brain

This job ain't worth the pay

Honey, I'm on my way

Shania Twain,"I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius-you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original, a know-it-all

Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else

Okay, so you're a rocket scientist
That don't impress me much
So you got the brain but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much

I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve-just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughta lock it
'Cause Heaven forbid it should fall outta place

Oh-oo-oh, so you think you're something special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else

Okay, so you're Brad Pitt
That don't impress me much
So you got the looks but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much

You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car good night
C'mon baby tell me-you must be jokin', right!

Oh-oo-oh, so you think you're something special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else

Okay, so you've got a car
That don't impress me much
So you got the moves but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night

That don't impress me much
You think you're cool but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night
That don't impress me much

Okay, so what do you think you're Elvis or something
Whatever
That don't impress me",That Don't Impress Me Much
Shania Twain,"Deep in Denialville
Tryin' a' fight the way I feel
I go jello when you smile
I start blushin' my head rushin'
If you stand too close to me
I might melt down from the heat
If ya' look my way one more time
I'm gonna go out of my mind
Whatever you do

Don't even think about it!
Don't go and get me started!
Don't you dare drive me crazy!
Don't do that to me baby!

You stop me in my tracks
My heart pumpin' to the max
I'm such a sucker for your eyes
They permanently paralyze
Whatever you do

Don't even think about it!
Don't go and get me started!
Don't you dare drive me crazy!
Don't do that to me baby!

(Whatever you do, don't do that to me)
You got my heart under attack
You give me shivers down my back
D'ya have to walk the way you do?
I get weak just watchin' you
Whatever you do

Don't even think about it!
Don't go and get me started!
Don't you dare drive me crazy!
Don't do that to me baby!

Shania Twain,"If elephants could fly I'd be a little more optimistic
But I don't see that happening anytime soon
I don't mean to sound so pessimistic
But I don't think that cow really jumped over the moon

When will I wake up?
Why did we break up?
When will we make up?

When money grows on trees
People live in peace
Everyone agrees
When happiness is free
Love can guarantee
You'll come back to me, that's when

I'd love to wake up smiling full of the joys of spring
And hear on CNN that Elvis lives again
And that John's back with the Beatles and they're going out on tour
I'll be the firs in line for tickets, gotta see that show for sure

When will I wake up?
Why did we break up?
When will we make up?

When money grows on trees
People live in peace
Everyone agrees
When happiness is free
Love can guarantee
You'll come back to me, that's when

When will I wake up?

From this moment you are the one
Right beside you is where I belong
From this moment on

From this moment I have been blessed
I live only for your happiness
And for your love I'd give my last breath
From this moment on

I give my hand to you with all my heart
Can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you

From this moment as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment on, oh

You're the reason I believe in love
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us
My dreams came true because of you

From (this) this moment as long as I live

Shania Twain,"When he opens the door, says I'm home
Be aware of the look in his eyes
They'll tell you the mood he's in
What kind of day it's been

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

There'll be a times when he won't say a word
And you'll wonder if it's something you said
A gentle touch of your hand
Will tell him you understand

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

Little things he forgets to do
Have you told him today I love you
When he reaches out, I'll be there
Show him how much you care

He's a man and a man has to try
Let him run, let him fall, let him cry
His world won't fall apart
If you take him into your heart

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him

Two hearts one love always forever
Standing the test of time","Two Hearts, One Love"
Shania Twain,"Full moon cravin' just a little
Young love from an innocent one
No shame it's purely noncommital
It's the only way to go if you want to have fun

Kickstart the rhythm pull out on the road
Relyin' on an overload
I need some baby blues reflectin' in the mirror
Tellin' me all the things I want to hear

Loved and lost 
I paid a painful cost
Feel my love
I've reached the point of no return

I'm wild and wicked
Wild and wicked for love
I'm wild and wicked
Wild and wicked for love

I need a guy that's full of sex appeal
I need a guy that looks good in the red
I want someone with a heart that I can steal
I want someone to drive me outta my head

Tight jeans, cute, and the way I might behave
Full of trouble you might say
All those things you said it
Oh I want him in the back that way

Loved and lost 
I paid a painful cost
Feel my love
I've reached the point of no return

I'm wild and wicked
Wild and wicked for love
I'm wild and wicked
Wild and wicked for love

I'm wild and wicked
Wild and wicked for love
I'm wild and wicked
Wild and wicked for love",Wild and Wicked
Shania Twain,"From the inside lookin' out
You're the one that I've been thinkin' about
I'm a lonely little fool over you babe

Got me dazed and confused
Got my body cryin' the blues
Come and see me
Got a line I'm throwing to you

You're the mountain that I want to climb
I won't stop till I reach it this time
I just can't get you outta my mind

I'm all fired up with no where to burn
Gotta hold myself steady
I'm all fired up with nowhere to burn
I know what I want and I'm ready

And you passed every test
You left me here starved and obsessed
With a hunger that begs for you

Draw, aim, fire
You can't run from my desire
It's my arrow through your heart surrender to me

You're the mountain that I want to climb
I won't stop till I reach it this time
I just can't get you outta my mind

I'm all fired up with no where to burn
Gotta hold myself steady
I'm all fired up with nowhere to burn
I know what I want and I'm ready

You're the mountain that I want to climb
I won't stop till I reach it this time
I just can't get you outta my mind

I'm all fired up with no where to burn
Gotta hold myself steady
I'm all fired up with nowhere to burn
I know what I want and I'm ready

I'm all fired up with no where to burn
Gotta hold myself steady
I'm all fired up with nowhere to burn
I know what I want and I'm ready
","All Fired Up, No Place to Go"
Shania Twain,"How can you tell me it wasn't for real?
Step into my shoes and see how it really feels
I know, I know why you do it
Still I can't stand, you putting me though it

Don't gimme that, once over
Don't gimme that, once over
That's just one step over the line

Once upon a time I let you near
And there was no reason that I had to fear
I know, I know it's easy for you to leave
But this time it's better for me to give than receive

Don't gimme that, once over
Don't gimme that, once over
That's just one step over the line

You made the place and time
How did you fake that crime?

Once in a while I'll think of you
Maybe somethin' old or somethin' brand new
I know, I know, I know where you'll be
Somewhere in the night lookin' for me

You can seek but you'll never find
'Cause you can't go back in time

Don't gimme that, once over
Don't gimme that, once over
That's just one step over the line

Don't gimme that, once over
Don't gimme that, once over
That's just one step over the line

Don't gimme that, once over
Don't gimme that, once over
That's just one step over the line

",Don't Give Me That
Shania Twain,"When he opens the door, says I'm home
Be aware of the look in his eyes
They'll tell you the mood he's in
What kind of day it's been

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

There'll be a times when he won't say a word
And you'll wonder if it's something you said
A gentle touch of your hand
Will tell him you understand

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

Little things he forgets to do
Have you told him today I love you
When he reaches out, I'll be there
Show him how much you care

He's a man and a man has to try
Let him run, let him fall, let him cry
His world won't fall apart
If you take him into your heart

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

",For the Love
Shania Twain,"I hear the slammin' of the door
There you go again
I can't take it anymore
That's just the way it is

But then I listen to my heart
And the anger fades
I wanna hold ya
Never let ya go away

I feel a raging war inside
A battle between the heart and mind
But love wins when I close my eyes

[Chorus]
The heart is blind
It will not see
When hope is gone
The heart will still believe
I see you go
Through tearful eyes
But for the sake of love
The heart is blind

I know there's been a lot of nights
When we couldn't sleep
The words are like a knife
They cut so deep

But when I listen to my heart
It's deeper than the pain
I really love ya
That's all that matters anyway

I feel a raging war inside
A battle between the heart and mind
But love wins when I close my eyes

And hard times can only make us strong
If we keep holding on

Well baby, I ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
Ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore
Ain't gonna eat out my heart anymore

Just 'cause I ain't sayin' it 
You should be ashamed what I've been seein' babe
You better watch you step 
Or you can bet you're gonna loose the best thing you ever had

I can see in your eyes

I should've know that you lied when you said to believe
That you'd love me enough that you'd never leave

But you just turned and walked away
You left me standing in the rain
You didn't take my love for real
Now how am I to feel

Love comes in and goes out
Like a season
You came in and walked out
For no reason

Do you really know what love is about
You really had me thinkin' there wan't a doubt

That you would love me forever
You wanted me to know
That I had to love you now or never

Shania Twain,"Hope life's been good to you
Since you've been gone
I'm doin' fine now, I've finally moved on
It's not so bad, I'm not that sad

I'm not surprised just how well I survived
I'm over the worst, and I feel so alive
I can't complain, I'm free again

And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath, to forget

Don't think I'm lyin' 'round cryin' at night
There's no need to worry, I'm really all right
I've never looked back, as a matter of fact

And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath, to forget

It only hurts when I breathe

Mmm, no, I've never looked back,
As a matter fact

And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath, to forget

Hurts when I'm breathing
Breaks when it's beating
Die when I'm dreaming
It only hurts when I breathe",It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing
Shania Twain,"Juanita she is the restless river
Running through my veins
She rides without the reins 
Her name's Juanita
She lives in the heart of every
Woman in the world
Within the reach of every girl
Who wants to meet her

(She's gonna be riding through)
Her name's Juanita
(She's gonna be riding free) 
She's riding free
(She's gonna be inside of you, gonna be inside of me)
She's inside of you and inside of me, yeah

[Chorus:]
Oh, go with her, flow with her
Dream with her, scream with her
Let her take over, or just get to know her
Be everything you can be
If you can find her and free her
Juanita will unchain your heart

When someone tries to take
Away the freedom of your choice
To take away your voice
That's when you need her
She's there if you dare to give
Your broken wings a try
C'mon and take a leap and fly,
And you can be her

(She's gonna be ridin' through) 
Oh, Juanita
(She's gonna be ridin' free) 
Ridin' free
(She's gonna be a part of you, gonna be a part of me) 
She's a part of you and a part of me, yeah

[Chorus]

Oh, go with her, flow with her
Dream with her, scream with her
Let her take over, or just get to know her
Be everything you can be

Shania Twain,"We live in a greedy little world,
That teaches every little boy and girl
To earn as much as they can possibly,
Then turn around and
Spend it foolishly
We've created us a credit card mess
We spend the money that we don't possess
Our religion is to go and blow it all
So it's shopping every Sunday at the mall
All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

Can you hear it ring
It makes you want to sing
It's such a beautiful thing, ka-ching!
Lots of diamond rings
The happiness it brings
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

When you're broke go and get a loan
Take out another mortgage on your home
Consolidate so you can afford
To go and spend some more when
You get bored

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

Can you hear it ring
It makes you want to sing
It's such a beautiful thing, ka-ching!
Lots of diamond rings
The happiness it brings
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

Let's swing
Dig deeper in your pocket
Oh, yeah, ha
Come on I know you've got it
Dig deeper in your wallet
Oh

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

Can you hear it ring
It makes you want to sing
It's such a beautiful thing, ka-ching!
Lots of diamond rings
The happiness it brings
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

Can you hear it ring
It makes you want to sing
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things
Ka-ching!",Ka-Ching!
Shania Twain,"I thought I might begin by filling you in, 
In case you didn't already know
I'll never forget how you got up and left
In fact it was downright pretty low
There ain't no way I want to
You know I ain't going to
Take you back, so don't even try
You can beg, you can plead, 
You can sweat, you can bleed
Too bad I could care if you cry

That's it! (That's all!) We had fun
(We had a ball!)
It was good while it lasted, 
But now I'm past it
(It was sure!) It was sweet
Sure you swept me off my feet
I miss you now and then
But would I do it all again, nah, 

[Chorus]
You won't find me
Naked and cold just a sitting
On the doctor's table
Waiting to be told just a why
I'm no longer able
To feel my heart beating, 
Give me a good reason why
I kind of went numb just around
About the time you told me
You were moving on, and you
Said that you were going to phone me
It's been so long, and there
Ain't nothing wrong with the line

It's too late to regret it
But you're the one who said it
We're better off being apart
I hate to be a downer
But don't bother coming 'round here
Cause I won't have a change of heart

That's it! (That's all!) We had fun
(We had a ball!)
It was good while it lasted, 
But now I'm past it
(It was sure!) It was sweet
Sure you swept me off my feet
I miss you now and then
But would I do it again, nah, 

[Chorus]

Nah

Well, I hope you learned a lesson
Cause you'll never be messing
With my head again the way that you did
It was never going to work; you were
Too much of a jerk
I'm finally fed up with it

That's it! (That's all!) We had fun
(We had a ball!)
It was good while it lasted, 
But now I'm past it
(It was sure!) It was sweet
Sure you swept me off my feet
I miss you now and then
But would I do it all again, nah, 

[Chorus]

Nah",Nah!

She plays the bass in a band
