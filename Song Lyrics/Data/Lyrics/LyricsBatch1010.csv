Marty Robbins,"A tall handsome stranger rode into town
With fire in his eyes burning red as sundown
His boots were all dusty, his coat open wide
Six ways of dying hung low on his side

He went in the town hall asking for me
They told him that I was still town deputy
I sent him to prison to pay for his crime
He killed a guard on the Sante Fe line

He spread word around town that my time had come
My notch was already carved on his gun
He's laughing and braggin and having his fun
It's all a show for he knows I won't run

That night in silence the town was asleep
I sat by my window and looked down the street
I wished in my heart that he would just ride away
I hated to face him next sunup that day

I met him at sunup, the crowd gathered round
Waitin and watching for one to go down
He grabbed for his six gun, tryin his best
He cursed as my bullet went deep in his chest

He stood there a moment and looked all around
Slowly and lifeless he fell to the ground
The stranger's my brother, born an outlaw
He must have forgotton I taught him to draw

The whole town was waiting and I was alone
The blood that I spilled was just like my own
When she hears this story, how Mother will cry
Brother 'gainst brother and one had to die

To die
To die







",Tall Handsome Stranger
Marty Robbins,"Guess who I saw today, and I asked him about you
I saw your new love and it was plain, he cares about you
But I'll wait until he's out of town
Then I'll call you up and want to come around

But don't let me touch you, don't let me get close to you
Though I might say nice things and I might bring a rose to you
There's just a chance your old romance might burn anew
Don't let me touch you, don't let me get close to you

Don't let me touch you, don't let me get close to you
Though I might say nice things and I might bring a rose to you
There's just a chance your old romance might burn anew
Don't let me touch you, don't let me get close to you

Don't let me touch you
",Don't Let Me Touch You
Marty Robbins,"Oh she may be weary
Them young girls they do get wearied
Wearing that same old miniskirt dress
But when she gets weary
You try a little tenderness

Oh man that
Un hunh
I know shes waiting
Just anticipating
The thing that you'll never never possess
No no no
But while she there waiting

Try just a little bit of tenderness
That's all you got to do
Now it might be a little bit sentimental no
But she has her greavs and care
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle
Yeah yeah yeah
And it makes it easier to bear
Oh she wont regret it

No no
Them young girls they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Yeah yeah yeah
But its all so easy
All you got to do is try
Try a little tenderness
Yeah
Damn that hart (hard?)

All you got to do is know how to love her

Marty Robbins,"I'd give anything to feel again
The warmness of your body close to mine
Like the foggy dew that drifts away
A love we knew drifted away with time
I'd give anything to feel again
The warmness of your face upon my chest
Lord, I'd love to hear you whisper, once again
You like the way I loved you best

Oh, it's not your fault that you're not here
I and I can't take the blame, Lord knows I tried
I did everything that I could do
I wasn't man enough to satisfy
You were just too much a woman
But the urge to love you keeps my mind from rest
Lord, I'd love to hear you whisper, once again
You like the way I loved you best

And if I never have the pleasure of your love again
I'll always have my dreams
But the drive to love you wakes me
In the middle of the nightime and it seems
I can almost feel the wetness of your warm
And salty tears upon my chest
Lord, I'd love to hear you whisper, once again
You like the way I loved you best
Lord, I'd love to hear you whisper, once again
You like the way I loved you best






",The Way I Loved You Best
Marty Robbins,"We both have fought the storms of life together
And at times it seemed our world was gonna end
We've touched the thorns of life now we know better
And we're more in love now than we've ever been
After the storm comes the sunshine
The clouds are gone and the world is tame
Into each life there will be showers
But don't the world look brighter, after the rain
Well the sweetest love is when we're back together
And it's just like a second honeymoon
And we touched the thorns of life now we know better
And the rain just helps to make the roses bloom
After the storm comes the sunshine
The clouds are gone and the world is tame
Into each life there will be showers
But don't the world look brighter, after the rain
Don't the world look brighter, after the rain",After the Storm
Marty Robbins,"Eighteen yellow roses came today
Eighteen yellow roses in a pretty bouquet
When the boy came to the door
I didn't know what to say
But eighteen yellow roses came today
I opened up the card to see what it said
I couldn't believe my eyes
When I had read
Though you belong to another I love you anyway
Yes eighteen yellow roses came today
I never doubted your love for a minute
I always thought that you would be true
But now this box and the flowers in it
I guess there's nothin' left for me to do
But ask to meet the boy that's done this thing
And find out if he's got plans to buy you a ring
'Cause eighteen yellow roses will wilt and die one day
But a father's love will never fade away
Will never fade away",Eighteen Yellow Roses
Marty Robbins,"When your baby says goodbye
And make you feel like you wanna die
That's the real beginnin' of
Someone fallin' out of love

When your baby goes away
Makes you lonely both night and day
That's the real beginnin' of
Someone fallin' out of love

Oh, I've been through it
Really I'm no stranger to it
And I've been around a while
I know how to fake a smile

I even had the look
To hide all the tears that burn
But I lost
But I lost
But I lost

When a kiss don't last too long
Then, for certain, somethin's wrong
Could be the real beginnin' of
Someone fallin' out of love
Someone's fallin' out of love







",Falling Out of Love
Marty Robbins,"It was easy to pick me up, easy to put me down
It was easy to give you all the love I had
And it was easy for you to make me think
I had made the grass turn green
'Cause the little love you gave me
Was more than I had seen

Helen, it hurts when I try to be strong
When most of the reasons for livin' are gone
Well you got me where you want me, a lonely cryin' clown
And you've almost got the best of me
And you've almost got me down

Well, it seems the givers always get taken just for fools
'Cause takers know that livers, lie by all the rules
While lovers do the livin' and the livin' do their best
And the takers take it all the time and the givers get the rest

Helen, it hurts when I try to be strong
When most of the reasons for livin' are gone
Well you got me where you want me, a lonely cryin' clown
And you've almost got the best of me
And you've almost got me down
And you've almost got the best of me
And you've almost got me down







",Helen
Marty Robbins,"I don't know why I love you like I do
I don't know why I just do
I don't know why you thrill me like you do
I don't know why but you do

You never seem to want my romancing
And the only time you hold me
Is when we're dancing

I don't know why I love you like I do
I don't know why I just do

You never seem to want my romancing
And the only time you hold me
Is when we're dancing

I don't know why I love you like I do
I don't know why I just do
I don't know why I just do

",I Don't Know Why (I Just Do)
Marty Robbins,"Seems that I don't think about you too much
I'm not too sure why I thought of you now
Time has a way of numbin' the touch
But I still recall when you left me just how much
It hurt me to stand there just watchin' you leave
I couldn't believe it was true
After moments we shared and the souls that we bared
I've never loved anyone more

But, like I said, I don't think of you much

There's someone beside me who helps me forget
She's taught me how not to think of you now
When I remember you I don't regret that
We couldn't hold on to the dreams that we share
Dreams that were there to believe in
And, for all of the pain, I would love you again
I've never loved anyone more
And, for all of the pain, I would love you again
I've never loved anyone more",I've Never Loved Anyone More
Marty Robbins,"Evening shadows make me blue
When each weary day is through
How I long to be with you, my happiness

Every day I reminisce
Dreaming of your tender kiss
Always thinking how I miss my happiness

A million years it seems
Have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again
There'll be no blue memories then

Whether skies are gray or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you, my happiness

Whether skies are gray or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you, my happiness




",My Happiness
Marty Robbins,"When I'm gone will you forget me
Will you find somebody new
When I'm gone will you forget me
Darlin', as you often do
When I'm gone will you forget me
Will you look for someone new
Will some other arms enfold you
Just the way mine used to do
Will there be no memory of me
Or the first day when we met
When I'm gone will you remember
Or when I'm gone will you forget",When I'm Gone
Marty Robbins,"What are friends for, Jenny
What do friends fulfill
Why are friendships stronger
And the love affair I remember still
What are friends for, Jenny
If it's not to share little moments talking
And little days of care
What are friends for, Jenny
If it's not to share little moments talking

And little days of care
Maybe, I could love you
Maybe, I could try
And then, we'd be like any lovers
And the love affair could die
So, if I want to hold you
Gently in my care
It's just because I almost loved you

And that's why friends are there

It's just because I almost loved you
And it's better we're still friends",Jenny
Marty Robbins,"Her eyes are blue the words are true
She gives me more love than I ever knew
But there is somethin' like a chain that's holdin' me
Why can't I break it and just be free
Her love is soft her heart is mine
She's sure that she will want me for all time
But there is somethin' like a cloud that hides the sun
And it's just your memory
Look what you've done

And it's not fair to her, she never knew you
And it's just as well 'cause then she'd cry
And she's so good to me with all her lovin'
I don't deserve her kiss but I can try
Her smile is pure she does no wrong
But I know deep within myself I'm not that strong
And she says, I will always be the only one
Ah, but she's been cheated
Look what you've done

And your memory is a cloud that hides the sun
And I'm in a prison
Look what you've done
And within' my mind I know the time will come
I'll have to hurt her

Marty Robbins,"I followed you to Texas
I followed you to Utah
We didn't find it there, so we moved on
I followed you to Alabam'
Things looked good in Birmingham
We didn't find it there, so we moved on

I know you're tired of following
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams

I had your child in Memphis
You heard of work in Nashville
We didn't find it there, so we moved on
To a small farm in Nebraska
To a gold mine in Alaska
We didn't find it there, so we moved on

And now we've left Alaska
Because there was no gold mine
But this time only two of us move on
Now all we have is each other
And a little memory to cling to
And still you won't let me go on alone

I know you're tired of following
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams
(Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams

",My Elusive Dreams
Marty Robbins,"So quickly time overtakes us
And there's so many things left to do
I've tried to say what I wanted to say
In this song that I've written for you

As I stand here tonight
From the stage I can see
People look back and smile
And my mind quickly flies
To the time that's gone by
And I say every tear's been worthwhile
Some songs I have sung
Hardly pleased anyone
It wasn't cause I never tried
I remember the gloom
Of a cheap little room
Where after a show I have cried
But I thank God above
For sendin' his love
Through people like you I call friends
And it's so good to know
That wherever we go
Some of us might meet again
Life's been worth livin'

So tonight let's pretend
That it never will end
Happiness dosen't last long
And if this night should be
The last night we should meet
Then let's say goodbye with a song

'Cause there's no way to know
When it's our turn to go
Everything's part of life's plan
You have given me love
In return I have love
For every woman and man
Life's been worth livin'

Life's been worth livin'
Worth livin'
Worth livin'




",The Performer
Marty Robbins,"Meet Me Tonight in Laredo Lyrics

She met him one night in Laredo just a wild comanchero they say
They told her that he'd been an outlaw and she'd have to send him away
They warned her of toil and of hardships and a life filled with heartaches and tears
Then one day he sent her a message the one she'd been waiting to hear
Meet me tonight in Laredo wait till the moon's hanging low
Meet me tonight in Laredo we'll soon be in old Mexico

The night as they slipped through the darkness
To the trail where their horses were tied
He whispered a prayer for tomorrow that she would be safe by his side
She smiled as they climbed in the saddle and as swift as a wild prairie wind
They rode to the Madre Sierra repeating these words once again
Meet me tonight in Laredo wait till the moon's hanging low
Meet me tonight in Laredo we'll soon be in old Mexico.

Now in their own hacienda in the glow of a soft candle light
The hands that once held a sixgun are holding their baby tonight
She echoes his God will go with us and at night when the moon's hanging low
She smiles as she fondly remembers the words he had said long ago
Meet me tonight in Laredo wait till the moon's hanging low
Meet me tonight in Laredo we'll soon be in old Mexico

",Meet Me Tonight in Laredo
Marty Robbins,"See then tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweed

I'm a rovin' cowboy ridin' all day long
Tumbleweeds around me sing their lonely song
Nights underneath the prairie moon
I'll ride along and sing a tune

See then tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweed

Cares of the past are behind
Nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind
Drifting along with a tumbling tumbleweed

I know when night is gone
That a new world's born at dawn

I'll keep rolling along
Deep in my heart is a song
Here on the range I belong

Marty Robbins,"Well I'm just a man, I'm weak in some ways
Sometimes I find it hard to find the strength
To make it through the day
But I've got a woman who carries me on
She gives me part of her faith
When all of my faith is gone

She's made of faith
She's taller than the mountains
Stronger than the strongest ship that sails the sea
Her faith is strong
Like an overflowing fountain
And when I need it most it overflows on me

She picks me up when life puts me down
Being the woman she is, I know she's strong enough
For me to lean upon
But sometimes it's hard to face a new day
When she looks at me and smiles I know
I've found a way

She's made of faith
She's taller than the mountains
Stronger than the strongest ship that sails the sea
Her faith is strong
Like an overflowing fountain
And when I need it most it overflows on me
And when I need it most it overflows on me




",She's Made of Faith
Marty Robbins,"I just stopped by to have a cup of coffee
And get some things I left when he moved in
I can't stay too long 'cause I've got someone waiting
I got to hurry up and meet a friend

Well, it's workin' out just fine since he took over
'Cause that leaves me lots of time to live it up
I'm almost late, I really should be goin'
But I guess there's time for just another cup

I see you've rearranged the way the house was
You've added some and took some things away
Could you warm this half-a-cup here that I'm holdin'
I don't have much time, I must be on my way

Well, I've talked so long and all you've done is listened
And that coffee pot's been empty for an hour
My friend's upset, but I know how to please her
I'll stop somewhere and buy some pretty flowers

It's too late to pick up what I came by for
And if I left them, do you really think he'd mind
'Cause like I said, I'm late and she won't like it
I'll drop by and pick them up some other time

Well' it's funny when you think what life can offer
When everything in life is up for trade
I was only drivin' by, just thought I'd drop in

Marty Robbins,"We could always find tomorrow when a problem came our way
We could reach back in a storehouse full of love
Now we can't find tomorrow or run back to yesterday
'Cause this time we've run completely out of love

This time there's no tomorrow, oh, we've told them all goodbye
We buried them in this hole we both dug
And we can't retrace our footsteps, yesterday has lost it's light
And this time we've run completely out of love

This time we found a mountain neither one of us can cross
And a valley where the sun don't ever shine
And this time we just can't make it, all the love we had is lost
And we've run completely out of love this time

This time we found a mountain neither one of us can cross
And a valley where the sun don't ever shine

Just when I think I've crossed that bridge
That's when you cross my mind

Today's the day I always prayed I'd never live to see
Oh you built me then tore me down and now you're leavin' me
But you'll go down as my greatest memory

Marty Robbins,"It's so hard to fight a memory
Only time can be a healer of the past
And the thorns of love are many
When they're clingin' to a love that didn't last
Yesterday is over and his memory
Will fade away with time
So I'll accept a rose and just be patient
Till all your love is mine

I can take the thorns if there's
Just an occasional rose
I can bear the pain for a while
Even though my heart knows
You'll be thinkin' of him when
We're makin' love, it always shows
I can take the thorns if there's
Just an occasional rose

The road of love is rocky and
Behind the blue sky there's a thousand storms
But a smile or a touch or a love word's
Like a rose among the thorns
When you say you love me
It erases all the worries on my mind
'Cause you'll be with me tonight
For a little while his memory's left behind

I can take the thorns if there's
Just an occasional rose
I can bear the pain for a while
Even though my heart knows
You'll be thinkin' of him when

I can take the thorns if there's

She's never been branded and she's never been tied down
She drifts for a while then she might drift back to town
And somethin' keeps callin' she has to move on to new ground

Wild as a prairie wind, warm as the hot desert sun
Places she's never seen keeps her from settlin' down
Just like a free runnin' river she rambles and rolls
The highway's her heaven, she makes the whole world her own

'Cause she's a drifter don't mean that I don't care about her
Sometimes I live with her, sometimes I'm livin' without her
Just when I think that I'm finally beginnin' to tame her
That's when she makes me feel bein' tied down kinda shames her

Down to the ocean, she might stay a while on the beach
Then caught by the high tide she drifts further on out of reach
There's no way a-tellin' how soon you may see her again
Nature's her mother and that makes her kin to the wind

'Cause she's a drifter don't mean that I don't care about her

While you're readin' these words
I'll be gone like a bird in the winter time

But I'm takin' with me all the
Sweet, sweet memories we made as my souvenirs
It's a shame that the laughter
Didn't outweigh all the tears

That's all she wrote
Everything that I own in a small envelope
Leavin' me so alone that I wanted to die
The moment when I read her note

That's all she wrote
I keep dreamin' that I'll wake up
And find you here with me
And as we love as before

Every dream becomes more a reality
Guess I'm losin' my mind to go on hopin'
I'll find that nothin' is wrong
There's your goodbye letter

Remindin' me that you're gone
That's all she wrote
Everything that I own in a small envelope
Leavin' me so alone that I wanted to die

The moment when I read her note
That's all she wrote
Oh, I wanted to die

Marty Robbins,"We were children who played
On the backstreets of border towns
And we dreamed of the day when we might run away
To where the good life was found

I remember the night
When I asked you to be my girl
Now I feel so ashamed of the promise I made
When I said I would give you the world

My Angelina, when I look in your eyes
I believe I could change the world
With you by my side
My Angelina, give me courage to try

I believe in the man I see
In my Angelina's eyes
Seems like nothin' worked out
Quite the way it was planned to be

Oh, the dreams that we chased when we came to this place
Are like nightmares to me
Workin' day after day
In the noise of the factory

And the money's no good but if I say a word
Immigration will take me away
My Angelina, when I look in your eyes
I believe I could change the world

With you by my side
My Angelina, give me courage to try
I believe in the man I see
In my Angelina's eyes

If I hadn't been drunk
I would never have hit that man
But the whiskey and I saw the look in his eye
When he asked Angelina to dance

Now they're takin' me south
To a jail down in border town
But it won't be for long, Angelina, be strong
Keep believin' our dreams will work out

Marty Robbins,"What can I do when they ask me about you
When they ask me if our love has died away
I wish that I could tell them, you'll be gone a little while
And not that you have gone away to stay

I wish that I could them that I'd never cared for you
That love was never meant for such as I
But in the mornin' you'll be gone and I'll be left alone
With memories of a love that passed me by

If you're ever feeling blue and want me back again
I'll be waiting here and hope my waiting's not in vain
How I wish that I could keep you with me from now on
But it's too late, tomorrow you'll be gone

Tomorrow you'll be leavin' and I'll stand and watch you go
In life and love you'll make another start
A million tears may flood my soul but not one will you see
The tears that fall will be within my heart

If the castles that you build should ever lean and fall
I'll be waiting here for you to answer when you call
How I wish that you were mine to treasure from now on
But it's too late tomorrow you'll be gone

Marty Robbins,"I got a letter from my baby
Came in the mail yesterday
She had an awful lot on her mind
She had an awful lot to say

Well, she treated me like an old, old friend
Just like a used to be
Well, I know by heart the words
She wrote to me

Oh yeah, well, well

She said, ""Dear Mister Johnson
Please sent back the letter that
I wrote you long time ago
We were kids, thought we were in love""

Oh yeah, well
She said, ""Dear Mister Johnson
Please send back a picture that we took""
And it was signed respectfully, Miss Brooks

Oh yeah, well, well

Well, I cried and I cried and I cried some more
I fell right down and I cried on the floor
I was hurtin' way down deep inside
Where it don't show, don't show

Well, I never felt so bad in my whole life
Thought Miss Brooks was gonna be my wife
But I done found out how wrong a man
In love can be, oh yeah

Well, I cried yesterday and all last night
Nothin' ever gonna be alright
Oh, well, I called Miss Brooks on the phone
And here's what I said well, I cried, I said now

Please don't make me send you, the letters that you wrote me
Wrote me long time ago, please don't make me
Send you back the pictures that we took
'Cause I still love you Miss Brooks

Well, I cried and I cried and I cried some more
Fell right down and I cried on the floor
I was hurtin' way down deep inside

Marty Robbins,"Well, me and my baby was a-walkin' down the road
Just a-hoppin' along like two little toadsâ?¦
I looked down at her; I said, â??What can we do?â??
She said, â??Let's go someplace where we can hop to the blues!â??

I said, â??I don't know a place where we can do such a thingâ?¦â??
She said, â??I know a place, and, man, it's just a dream!
It's just a little spot on the outside of town
Where we can really pick 'em up and put 'em down!â??

So we went to a place called â??Everybody'sâ??
There I met a little chick called â??the Tennessee Toddyâ??â?¦
The reason she was called â??the Tennessee Toddyâ??
Was that she was all legs with a little bitty body,
But that cat could go, yeah, she was gone, gone, along gone,
And I'll tell you all about it in the very next verse of my song.

She was long and lean like a green string bean:
Calm and collected and cool and keen!
She was all of this and a whole lot more;
When my baby saw me watching her, she threw me out the door
And we were gone, yeah, we were gone, along gone,
And I'll tell you more about it in the very next verse of my song.

I took my baby home and she said, â??Good nightâ?¦â??
She said, â??Be real good and sleep real tight!â??
I rushed right back to Everybody's
'Cause I had to get acquainted with the Tennessee Toddy!
So I left, yeah, I was gone, gone, along gone,
And I'll tell you more about it in the very next verse of my song.

I was back there jumpin' with Toddy at three
When in walked a gent twice as big as me
He looked real mean and mad and sore;
He made for me and I made for the door,
Just a-runnin', yeah, I was gone, gone, along gone,
And there ain't no more, so this is the end of my songâ?¦

",You Don't Owe Me a Thing
Marty Robbins,"Well, he walks out in the arena
All dressed up to the brim
Said he'd just came down from a place
Called ""Highland Rim""

Well, he said he came to ride the horse
The one they call ""The Brute""
But he didn't look like a cowboy
In his Continental Suit

We snickered at the way he dressed
But he never said a word
He walks on by the rest of us
As if he hadn't heard

A thousand bucks went to the man
Who could ride this wild cayuse
A meaner horse was never born
Than the one they called ""The Brute""

The horse that he was looking for
Was in chute number eight
He walked up very slowly
Put his hand upon the gate

We knew he was a thoroughbred
When he pulled his sack of ""Dukes""
From the inside pocket
Of his Continental Suit

Well, he rolled hisself a ""Corley""
And he lit it standing there
Blew himself a smoke ring
And he watched it disappear

We thought he must be crazy
When he opened up the gate
Standing just inside was
Fifeteen hundred pounds of hate

The Buckskin tried to run him down
But the stranger was too quick
He stepped aside and threw his arms
Around the horse's neck

And pulled himself up on the back
Of the horse they called ""The Brute""
Sit like he was born there
In his Continental Suit

""The Brute's"" hind-end was in the air
His front end on the ground
Kickin' and a-squealin', tryin' to
Shake this stranger down

But the stranger didn't give an inch
He came to ride ""The Brute""
And he came to ride the Buckskin
In a Continental Suit

Well, I turned around to look at Jim
And he was watchin' me
He said, ""I don't believe
The crazy things I think I see

But I think I see the outlaw
The one they call ""The Brute""
Ridden by a cowboy
In a Continental Suit""

""The Brute"" came to a stand-still
Ashamed that he'd been rode
By a city cowboy in
Some Continental clothes

The stranger took his money
And we don't know where he went
We don't know where he came from
And we haven't seen him since

The moral of this story:
Never judge by what they wear
Underneath some ragged clothes
Could be a millionaire

Everybody listen
Don't be fooled by this galoot
This sure-'nough bronc buster

In worlds so far apart 
You want me yet there's something else

If you don't want me like I am

If you can't change a little bit 
Then why not set me free

We'll both make brand new starts

But I can't change my way of life

Or take the way you live

She loved him with all her heart, and he the girl adored
But all their friends believed they were too young to know the score
Cause she was only seventeen and he was one year more

Isn't he too young to be a husband, her a wife?

In fond embrace we kissed to seal our love
A hallowed light reflected teardrops falling

Or one with just a name and lovely Bible verse

",Don't Sing Aloha When I Go
Marty Robbins,"Down where the tradewinds play
Down where they lose the day
We found a new world
Where Paradise starts we traded hearts
The night that I sailed away

Flowers were in her hair
Music was everywhere
Under an awning of silvery boughs we traded vows
The night that I sailed away

Tradewinds, what are vows that lovers make
Tradewinds, are they only made to break

When it is May again
I'll sail away again
Though I am returning it won't be the same
She traded her name
Way down where the tradewinds play

Tradewinds, what are vows that lovers make
Tradewinds, are they only made to break

When it is May again
I'll sail away again
Though I am returning it won't be the same
She traded her name
Way down where the trade winds play

Marty Robbins,"Well, some folks like the summertime
When they can walk about
Strollin' through the meadow green
Well, it's pleasant, there's no doubt
Give me the wintertime when
The snow is on the ground
'Cause I found her when
The snow was on the ground
I found a-little footprints in the snow-ow-ow-low-ow
Found a-little footprints in the snow-ow-ow-low-ow
Bless that happy day that Nellie lost her way
'Cause I found her when
The snow was on the ground
When I dropped in to see her
Was a yellow moon
Her Mamma said, she just stepped out
Be returnin' soon-on
I found her little footprints
And I traced them through the snow
And I found her when
The snow was on the ground
I found a-little footprints in the snow-ow-ow-low-ow
Found a-little footprints in the snow-ow-ow-low-ow
Bless that happy day that Nellie lost her way
Why?, 'cause I found her when
The snow was on the ground
Well, now she's up in Heaven
With an angel band
I know I'm gonna see her
In that promised land
Every time the snow falls
Well, it brings back memories

Marty Robbins,"God understands, he knows all about us
He knows of our hopes, he knows of our plans
He's willing to help if we will but follow
He knows all about us, God understands

I walk with the Lord in sunshine and darkness
I cannot forsake his word and command
Temptation is great, his love is still greater
He knows all about us, God understands

I know of his love, I know all it's meaning
I know of the power he's given to man
Without faith in God my life would be worthless
He knows all about us, God understands

When trouble appears and life has no meaning
Be washed and be cleansed in the blood of the Lamb
He's trusted and tried so cast him your worries
He knows all about us, God understands







",God Understands
Marty Robbins,"Don't listen to gossip whatever you do
It's usually lies that you'll hear
What they say about me they say about you
So kiss me and dry up your tears

And don't you believe what they say about me
They're tryin' to keep us apart
The vows that were spoken weren't meant to be broken
Don't turn me away from your heart

It's cheap and it's worthless, so cold and so cruel
It's gossip that I'm speakin' of
So often it starts on the lips of a fool
And ends in the ashes of love

So don't you believe what they say about me
They're tryin' to keep us apart
The vows that were spoken wern't meant to be broken
Don't turn me away from your heart

Marty Robbins,"If half of all the things you say, were true instead of lies
Then there'd be only half as many teardrops in my eyes
If half of all the dreams I dream, were ever to come true
Then in my heart I'd feel I had, a half-way chance with you

If most of all the things I hear, were only half-way true
Then I'd be half-way happy dear and only half as blue
If you spent half the time with me, you spend with someone new
Then in my heart I'd feel I had, a half-way chance with you

A half-way love is not enough, it's always kiss an run
I just can't fool my heart that way, I must have all, or none
If part-time love is all you want, or all you care to give
Why bother with the love at all, and only half-way live

If some of all the tears that fall, were yours and not all mine

But you took my name knowing I could never change

While dining they were chatting in a sort of joking way
There came a pretty waitress to bring the tray of food

When somethin' that was said to her brought teardrops to her eyes
She turned on her tormentors, her cheeks were flamin' red

You may have a sister who needs protection now
I've come to this great city to find my brother, dear
You would not dare insult me, sir, if brother Jack were here

Forgive us, miss, we meant no harm, pray tell us what is your name

Isn't he too young to be a husband, her a wife?

Marty Robbins,"One cold winter's night not a star was in sight
Then the North wind came howling down the line
With his sweetheart so dear stood a brave engineer
With his orders to pull old Number Nine.

She kissed him goodbye with a tear in her eye
And the joy in his heart he could not hide
For the whole world was bright as she told him that night
That tomorrow she'd be his blushing bride.

Oh the wheels hummed a song as the train rolled along
And the black smoke came pouring from the stack
And the headlight a-gleam seemed to brighten his dream
Of tomorrow when he'd be goin' back.

He sped 'round the hill and his brave heart stood still
A headlight was shining in his face
As he whispered a prayer as he threw on the air
For he knew this would be his final race.

In the wreck he was found lying there on the ground
And he asked them to raise his weary head
As his breath slowly went, this message he sent
To the maiden he knew he could not wed

""There's a little white home that I bought for our own
Where I dreamed we'd be happy, bye and bye
But I'll leave it to you for I know you'll be true
Til we meet at those Golden Gates, goodbye.""",The Wreck of the Number Nine

You're tryin' to tell me goodbye while you cry
You're takin' a love and you know it can't mend
You're leavin' a love that won't die
I'm tellin' myself that you'll be back again
But your lips tell me this is a lie
There's no way to measure the price I will pay
For the few months of Heaven I've known
My sunshine will go leavin' darkness, I know
I'll be left in this world all alone

The birds that would sing on the hill never will

Your wrong is comin' home to you
It's your heart's turn to break
You didn't want her like she was
You tried to change her life

Because she was your wife
And now you waken from your sleep
To face a cold gray dawn
You lay there all alone and weep
Her love for you is gone
You cheated when you tried to play
The game of give and take
Now all your tears are souvenirs
It's your heart's turn to break
You didn't try to understand
When she was feelin' blue
Your every wish was her command
She lived her life for you
You'd like to have her back again

Your love is lost now pay the cost

That you could never keep

And the world belonged to me 'cause you were mine

Cause the world was mine last night about this time

But it isn't in your plan that you should care
And the lips I kissed are lips I only share
And the kiss you gave was never really mine
Love walked in and out last night about this time

Tonight you hold another in your arms
And he'll thrill the way I did to all your charms
And he'll kiss the same sweet lips I wish were mine

Marty Robbins,"While you're dancing I'll just sit here at this lonely table
While you're laughing I'll try to force a smile as long as I'm able
While you're clinging to them I'll keep clinging to the past
Getting sicker inside while the lonely minutes pass
Oh the nights never end too fast while you're dancing

While you're dancing for just a moment you're anybody's baby
You're romancing in your mind or behind my back maybe
In your heart you keep wishing that I would go away
So you could leave with someone else I wasn't born yesterday
Oh I don't know what to do or say while you're dancing

It seems like such a sin you'd make me feel this way
But sometimes I wonder if you know what feeling is
I guess I'll always let you make me feel this way
And as long as you let me I'll stay

While you're dancing I'll just keep on a sittin' at this table
While they're laughin' at me I'll try to take it just as long as I'm able
While you're wandering cross the floor I'll keep wondering deep inside
If I had walked out long ago how much less would I have cried
Oh how many times have I cried while you're dancing
Oh how many times have I cried while you're dancing

Marty Robbins,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

I want two pearl handled six guns

I'll line my saddle seat with felt

Just married this mornin'.
How happy they are.
""Just Married"" written on
The window of a-their car.
It broke my heart
To see them drive away.
I lost the one I love today.

Dressed all in white satin,
White lace in her hair.
She looked so lovely
It was more than I could bear.
Some people guessed the way that I felt
They saw the tears I could not hide.

I should have stayed at home.
I knew what was in store,
But somethin' made me come
To see her just once more.

Marty Robbins,"Down in Jamaica where the soft winds blow
I took a trip it was a long time ago
From distant shores the music gently played
And I was hypnotized by a dark skinned girl that danced and whirled
Quickly I knew I was in love with that calypso girl

Dance and whirl calypso girl you could never give your heart
Dance and dine and drink the wine
But someday you will know what makes the lonely teardrops start

She danced in Del Camino Inn each night
And how I longed to kiss and hold her tight
Her sparkling eyes were burning just for me
We celebrated and with kisses warm she led me on
She promised she would wait for me while I was gone

Dance and whirl calypso girl...

The night I left she said she loved me so
And went into another's arms I know
They raised their glass and drank a toast to love
And then she danced for him with eyes that tempt and form that whirls
For no one love could hold the heart of calypso girl

Dance and whirl calypso ...

Back to Jamaica I did go one day
Down to Camino Inn to hear them play
Outside the door was a woman dressed in rags
No one would care to see that beggar woman dance and whirl
It broke my heart to know it was my calypso girl

Dance and whirl calypso girl...

Marty Robbins,"Last night I heard a record playin'
On the radio, as I walked through the door
And the song revived some sweet old memories
'Cause I knew I've heard the tune somewhere before

I stopped a moment and I listened
And then I finally realized
That you were here the night you wrote it
A song called The Beginning Of Goodbye

I knew, that night, that it was over
And that I couldn't keep you. Should I try?
'Cause you were really talkin' to me
When you wrote The Beginning Of Goodbye

You left, and patiently I waited
'Cause I believed you'd write to me
But you don't have time there for an old friend
With your new friends in Nashville, Tennessee

I knew, that night, that it was over
And that I couldn't keep you. Should I try?
'Cause you were really talkin' to me
When you wrote The Beginning Of Goodbye

The curtain is descending
This is our last goodbye
The show has had it's run
Now it's ending
I was not the star but
Mine was an important part
I gave all that I could give
There was nothin' left to give
After I gave my heart

This is our last goodbye
I'll leave the stage in laughter
I just can't let her see
The fool she's made of me
The tears come after
I've rehearsed so much that I
Can't leave the stage and never cry
This is our last goodbye







",Our Last Goodbye
Marty Robbins,"Sometimes love is like a clear day
And you can almost see forever
When the skies are overcast
With threatining clouds of never

Like a blanket they descend
Bringing chilly winds of sorrow
As the land of love grows dim
You can't even see tomorrow

Come the storms of disappointment
Come the rains of deep despair
Howling winds of desperation
There's no shelter anywhere

Then the storm begins to weaken
Slow at first, but finally dies
Suddenly you see tomorrow
As you do you realize

Sometimes love is like a clear day
And you can almost see forever

He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

There's even been a minister or two

Who encourage you with words that go like this
Burn your draft card if you like, it's good to disagree
That's a get acquainted Communistic kiss

One politician said it would be nice to send some blood
And help the enemy in Vietnam
That's what he says, here's what I say
Let's just keep the blood
Instead let's send that politician man
Let's rid the country of the politicians,
Who call us tramps, that march out in our streets
Protesting those who want to fight for freedom, my friend
This kind of leader makes our country weak
Now, ain't I right (ain't he right)

It's time we found just how our neighbours stand
If we're to win this war with Communism
Let's fight it here as well as Vietman
Let's rise as one and meet our obligations

You played love's game too rough.

If you fly very high in the sky you'll find the sun may burn your wings
And each song you hear let it go in and out your ear
Don't be fooled by the beautiful songs the nightbirds sing

Your daddy loves you best much more than all the rest

An eagle waits for watch what you do be careful butterfly

Neath a simple grave of stone

Covered wagons keep on rolling never question or ask why

Marty Robbins,"Once I had a silly notion to out across the ocean
The future for me didn't look to bright
So I signed up with a tanker, 
Got on board and raised the anchor
Stood and watched the Golden Gate fade out of sight
Nineteen days and nights we travelled
Through the stormy seas we battled
'Till we landed in Australia far away
Far from friends and San Francisco
And the Miss I thought I'll miss so
'Till I stepped ashore in Melbourne that first day

But I met Melba from Melbourne she made my heart yearn
She made my tears flow like wine
She let me kiss her then made me miss her 
'Cause Melba could never be mine

So in love but couldn't get her
Cared so much, couldn't forget het
I fell in love just a little bit more and more
There I was just like I started
All alone and broken hearted
I recall the day I left Australia's shore
I was standing there and tryin' 
So hard to keep from crying
The more I tried, the more my tears would show
Then a cold breeze seem to whisper
""it's the end you better kiss her""
So I kissed her and I turned away to go

Then I left Melba from Melbourne
She made my heart yearn
She made my tears flow like wine
She wouldn't leave there
I couldn't stay there
So Melba could never be mine

Gladly will I help this world

Comes my own native land
Is it right that we should give
And give until it hurts
To a foreign land that treats us
Just like so much dirt
Those who lead us have forgotten
Love is in the soul
Love cannot be purchased with
The promise of more gold
Giving brings a lot of joy
And this I do believe
But aren't the ones who give so much
Entitled to receive
Why do we keep on giving
Is it right that we should please
The very ones who'd like to see
Our country on her knees
If we must give then we should use
A different policy
And give to only those who treat us
Fair and honestly
We give to those who quickly take it
Posing as a friend
Then just as quickly turn and bite
The hand that's feeding them
I'll be accused but I don't feel
I'm acting selfishly
'Cause I believe the country that
Remains strong will stay free

And they're travellin' on that Southern Dixie Flyer

And the only joy I've seen
What God has given now he takes away

To be laid there with her daddy in the grave

I can't even take her home
But I want to be there with my heart's desire
But then she could say no more
As the echo drifted o'er
Was the whistle of that Southern Dixie Flyer

As the train pulled out of sight
And the day became as night
Was a scene to bring a tear to any eye
Just a lady all alone
Not a thing to call her own
But some memories from a better day gone by

I knew right away
There was nothin' I could say
To soothe her heart
Or dry those tear dimmed eyes
So I turned to walk away
From the lady old and gray
Whose heart was on that Southern Dixie Flyer

I've no money of my own
I can't even take her home
But I want to be there with my heart's desire
But then she could say no more
As the echo drifted o'er
Was the whistle of that Southern Dixie Flyer

Marty Robbins,"(Content we'll be if we will choose his way)

What God has done is not a hidden secret
Our eyes behold his glory day by day
Our hearts may feel his presence close beside us
Content we'll be if we will choose his way

Great are the words of God the great creator
Great is the work done by his mighty hand
In heaven or earth there's no one who is greater
And in his love forever we shall stand

His is a tune to hear the pain just disperse
His heart is overflowing now with love
His eyes are heavens searching longing for us
And with his hands he beckons from above

Great are the words of God the great creator...

Marty Robbins,"A long time ago in the small border town of Nogales
There lived a beautiful Mexican girl named Ava Maria Morales
Her dark hair would glisten and shine when touched by the sun
And she loved a cowboy that told her he worked on a ranch just outside of Tucson

Diamonds he gave to her caused many people to say
How could he give her such diamonds as these on thirty a month cowboy pay
She paid no attention to what they said or what they did
Cause she never doubted he worked on a ranch out of Tucson just like he said

Then to Nogales one morning came ridin' a stranger
He wore a badge on the front of his vest the new one in town was a ranger
And he showed some pictures of outlaws and bandits he chased
And one of the pictures caused Ava Maria to turn with fear on her face

Ava Maria it's true what they said
Your cowboy's an outlaw with a price on his head

The ranger left town on the trail of the outlaws he hunted
Ava Maria prayed he'd never catch the cowboy she loved and she wanted
Cause deep in her heart she believed that the ranger was wrong
The outlaw just looked like the cowboy that worked on the ranch just outside of Tucson

True love would never let Ava Maria believe it
And there in her window each evening she'd light a candle and hope he would see it
The years turned her dark hair to silver but love still lived on
She prayed every night for the cowboy that worked on the ranch just outside of Tucson

One night the town of Nogales was saddened to see
The window where Ava Maria would watch was dark where a light used to be
Some love stories live for awhile and then they are gone
For over a century the story of Ava Maria has lived on and on

Ava Maria it's your spirit lives on
I hope you have found him at the ranch just outside of Tucson




",Ava Maria Morales
Marty Robbins,"I rode into Tucson three hours ago for supplies and a short friendly game
Of poker while Smitty put some new shoes on old Dan before he goes lame
I sat in a game at the Miner's Saloon soon I had doubled my stake
The cards run like they'd been dealt by Lady Luck they were just sealin' my fate
A young cowboy lost more than he could afford and accused me of dealin' too smart
His draw was too slow and he fell to the floor with three bullets close to the heart
Oh cottonwood tree are you waiting for me waiting to take me away
I've done no wrong but the town cannot see and so with my life I must pay

A crowd started gatherin' the sheriff came in I handed him over my gun
Was then when I found out the boy I had killed
Was the town's biggest man's only son
I tried to explain I had shot in defense it was the young cowboy or me
The crowd wouldn't listen so they drug me out to the limb of this cottonwood tree
Majestically standing out here all alone it's spring and the valley is green
But I can't admire a place I don't belong to me it's all like a bad dream
But old Dan's beneath me with new shows and all
As they place the noose round my neck
Cowboys I've never laid eyes on before are tyin' my hands to my back
Oh cottonwood tree...

I see hate in the eyes of the town's biggest man as he pulls a branch from the tree
To whip the backside of my old pony Dan so he'll run out from under me
Insane he won't listen to my last appeal a wild grin has covered his face
As I tried to reason just how he would feel if he were up here in my place
There's many a mountain trail I'll never ride green valleys I'll never see
A young cowboy died and a man's foolish pride brought me to this cottonwood tree
My face is turned upward and I cannot breathe the sky's growing dark overhead
The knot's pulling tight as my body swepts free a few moments more I'll be dead
Oh cottonwood tree...




",Cottonwood Tree
Marty Robbins,"The night was ablaze with a heavenly fire of lightnin' wind and rain
And the sound of thunder is spookin' the herd and I fear there'll be a stampede
The cattle are starting to mill around their bellows strike fear in my heart
I know if the storm lasts very much longe there's bound to be a stampede
Stampede cry stampede the thing that a cowboy fears the most is stampede

As I sat in the sadle the night's wearing on and the storm is lingering still
The lightning's glare on the restless herd make it seem like a sea's angry swell
Then all of a sudden a bolt of fire strikes the tree where my pony stands
As I fall to the ground I can hear the sound of a drover yellin' stampede
Stampede cry stampede the thing that a cowboy fears the most is stampede

For a moment I lay in the mud half dazed I could hear the herd bearin' down
And I crawled in a ditch where a tree came to rest
And I crouched between it and the ground
It seems like a miracle of God's hand it's over and I'm still alive
And I thank the trail boss up in the sky for sparin' me from the stampede
Stampede cry stampede the thing that a cowboy fears the most is stampede




",Cry Stampede
Marty Robbins,"When I was a young man beginnin' my teens
How well I remember the lickin's I'd get cause I'd dream
My work never finished, barely begun
I couldn't get started till all of my dreamin' was done

I wouldn't shuck cotton', I wouldn't chop wood
And Pa would whip me and say that's for bein' no good
But I kept chasin' rainbows, finally I found
The great open range and the hills were my best dreamin' ground

When I left the home place our Mother did cry
She begged me to stay there and not say goodbye
My Pa told my Mother, your tears are in vain
Your son is a dreamer and the winds call his name

So don't try to stop him, let him move on
'Cause he won't stop his driftin'
Till all of his dreamin' is gone

Last night in a campfire a face I did see
A vision of Mother, she seemed to be callin' to me
For seventeen years now, I've drifted alone
But I wanna see Mother, tomorrow I start driftin' home

The last hill I've climbed now, and what do I see
An old run down shack where the ranch used to be
Then I see a tombstone and then see one more
I drifted too long from the old ranch house door

There's nothin' more left now but driftin', it seems
But I hope I can dream of the lickin's I'd get
'Cause I'd dream







",The Dreamer
Marty Robbins,"Way out west an Arizona cowboy tends the herd
The dessert lies beneath a sky of blue
Far away, in brightest day, a ghostly sound is heard
The phantom of the rail comes into view

Hear that lonesome whistle callin'
On his lonely ear is fallin'
Loud and clear, just hear that lonesome wail
But it's just the ghost, the phantom of the rail

Little did he know the train was wrecked in '84
After it had crossed the Great Divide
Every year it tries again to make it just once more
If only to the California Line

Hear that lonesome whistle callin'
On the barren dessert fallin'
Loud and clear, just hear that lonesome wail
But it's just the ghost, the phantom of the rail

Clickity-clack along the track, it's boiler showin' red
As on it comes along the rusty rails
People that are ridin' in the cars have long been dead
Lost in time along the Phantom Trail

Hear that lonesome whistle callin'
On the barren dessert fallin'
Is it real to feel the very ground beneath him shake
As on it comes, the only run it ever makes

Cross here comes the phantom, as his eyes in wonder gaze
His pony shys and heads in for the brush
And as it comes upon him terror grips his heart, amazed
Leapin' to avoid it's onward rush

Hear that lonesome whistle callin'
On the barren dessert fallin'
Thought he saw the engineer, thought he heard him once more wail
As on he went, forever bent, on stayin' on the ghost train rail







",Ghost Train
Marty Robbins,"The story began in Renosa
A village in old Mexico
A girl and a Mexican soldier
Were sweethearts, a long time ago
They made big plans for a wedding
The town of Renosa would go
And there would see Jimmy Martinez
Married to Sarah Sero
Oh-oh-oh
One day there came a message
It said that Jimmy must go
As Jimmy was leavin' Renosa
To fight at the Alamo
He never returned to Renosa
The story's been told and retold
How Jimmy the Mexican soldier
Died at the Alamo
Oh-oh-oh
Jimmy's last letter to Sarah
Began with a message like this
Oh dear one how sweet is the memeory
The memory of our parting kiss
I send my heart in this letter
I pray to the one up above
Oh Sarah, don't ever forget me
Stay just as pure as the dove
Oh-oh-oh
I'm like the dove in your window
It's chosen just one mate for life
And you are the one I have chosen
The one that I want for my wife
He never returned to Renosa
The story's been told and retold
How Jimmy the Mexican soldier
Died at the Alamo
Oh-oh-oh
Sarah refused to believe them
She prayed for Jimmy's return
And there ever night in her window
A small little candle would burn
Years turned her dark hair to silver
She prayed for Jimmy so long
Then one night the village was saddened
The light in her window was gone

Marty Robbins,"On the ranch there's a lonely old bunkhouse
Since all the old timers have gone
To a ranch with a much better bunkhouse
That you hear about only in song 

Where each bunk has a soft feather pillow
There are soft downy rugs on the floor
In the yard there are green weeping willows
And a welcome sign tacked on the door 

Each night in my dreams down the trail I can see
Travis and Bob, and they're waiting for me 

On the ranch there's a lonely old bunkhouse
Since all the old timers have gone

Let me see the mountains over yonder
Give me lots of elbow room but never tie me down

Let me ride until I've seen the beauty of it all
Let me sleep out in the cold upon the dampened ground
But never tie me down

How many tears since I've walked by your side Virginia
Too many moonlights have come and gone
Too many sunups and too many sundowns
Too many teardrops and too many roses have died

I'm just the same lonely and still broken hearted
Maybe I'm older but nothing's changed
Love grows no colder I still feel the same
Life has been empty but I've learned to live it Virginia

Oh Virginia when will I stop loving you will it go on forever
Oh Virginia when will these dreams that I dream of you stop maybe never

A harder ridin' bunch of outlaws no one ever saw
I don't recall the lawman that could match or beat the draw

The never lost a fight
They did their hidin' in the daytime
Ridin' most at night

The outlaws are commin' (commin', commin')
They rode into Yuma on a hot September day
Hit the bank and got the gold and then they rode away
The sheriff tried to stop 'em but he didn't really try

And he didn't wanna die

The rangers caught the outlaws and the fightin' did begin
For seven hours they fought and there were bodies all around
Not one body of an outlaw lay upon the ground

They only took the money that the rich got by their greed
And gave it to the ranchers who were desperately in need
They'd ride into the poorest section of a border town
Evenly distributed to the poorest of the town

The outlaws are commin' (commin', commin')
Maybe it was wrong to steal, but was it wrong to give?
They took many chances so a friend in need might live
One by one they've gone but still there's one alive to tell

I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rose's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell.
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love

So in anger I challenged his right
For the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered
In less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger
Lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment I stood
There in silence
Shocked by the foul evil
Deed I had done
Many thoughts ran through my mind
As I stood there
I had but one chance and
That was to run

Out through the back door
Of Rose's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one
He looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride.
Just as fast as

I could from the West Texas
Town of El Paso
Out through the badlands
Of New Mexico
Back in El Paso
My life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life
Nothing is left

But it's been so long since
I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than
My fear of death.

I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this
Pain in my heart
And at last here

I am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rose's Cantina below
My love is strong and it
Pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see
Five mounted cowboys
Off to my left
Ride a dozen or more.
Shouting and shooting
I can't let the catch me
I've got to make it to Rose's back door.

Something is dreadfully 
Wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to
Stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary
Unable to ride
But my love for

Felina is strong and
I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary
I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of
Smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go
Deep in my chest

Kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving
Arms that I'll die for

Marty Robbins,"All night long I tried to sleep but sleep refused to come
Cause today I knew I'd either have to fight or run
Knowin' if I choose to run my mind would never rest
Cause with so much pride I wear this badge upon my vest

Folks are filled with fear because there's three bad guns in town
Sheriff Olsen made the wrong move and they shot him down
One they called Dakota Jack and one El Paso Red
The other just turned twenty and he's called the Killer Kid

Good advice I get and that's to leave and run away
But my pride and badge I wear won't let me live this way
And if I stay the three have bragged they'll add me to their list
But I have a different aim and I don't aim to miss

From the doorway where I stand I see the outlaws three
Worried none because they know the town's not helpin' me
From a hundred yards away I try a lucky shot
Luck is with me and Dakota Jack dies on the spot

Well a kid runs through the barroom door and Red goes up the stairs
The Kid is ragin' mad, he's breakin' bottles, kickin' chairs
And from a roof El Paso Red has vowed to pay me back
As he views the lifeless body of Dakota Jack

I can see him as he jumps from one roof to the next
Searchin' for me but he has no idea where I'm at
But I watch his every move I'm ready when he leaps
As I shoot him in mid air he crashes to the street

Now there's one against just one I've evened up the score
Down the street I hear a yell come through the barroom door
The Kid has screamed, there's no way I can live unless I run
Said there ain't no lawdog man enough to take his gun

Through the barroom door he walks and steps out on the street
I can't match his draw, he's much too fast for me to beat
And as I walk toward him we both grab a forty-five
Maybe I will die today and he will stay alive

Like a hammer somethin' hits me spinnin' me around
As I fall I shoot him twice before he hits the ground
His bullet missed me , still I feel a burnin' in my chest
His bullet hits the badge I wear with pride upon my vest

As the people view the bodies of the lifeless three
From their looks I know exactly what they think of me
To them I'm just a killer and they could not care less
'Bout my pride or 'bout the badge I wear upon my vest






",Pride and the Badge
Marty Robbins,"Gather 'round cowboys I'll tell you a tale
A story that's hard to be told
Of a trick ridin' cowgril we loved and we called
The queen of the big roder

Wherever she went she was always acclaimed
As the greatest of trick ridin' girls
Perfection and beauty were her's all alone
She was strickly the best in the world

Cowboys and cowgirls remarked of her charm
And a smile that brightened the world
Admired and chosen by many a man
As the best of the trick ridin' girls

One night in Houston the crowd was so big
There was forty-five thousand or more
She had just about finished her act for the night
One more trick the crowd waited for

A dangerous trick at the horse's full speed
A trick that had never been tried
Cowboys and cowgirls both knew if she failed
If she fell she could easily die

The ride was perfection and almost complete
Suddenly somethin' went wrong
The sinch gave away and she lost control
And at full speed she fell to the ground

Not one muscle moved as she lay where she fell
She's unconscious, one bronc buster said
But the doctor removed any doubt from our minds
When he said, the young cowgirl was dead

Not one livin' soul in the crowd made a move
They all knew that somethin' was wrong
As they took her away from the place where she lay
They knew the young cowgirl was gone

Cowboys just stood there with hats in their hands
Their heads were bowed ever so low
Not one eye was dry as we whispered, goodbye
To the queen of the big rodeo







",Queen of the Big Rodeo
Marty Robbins,"

Restless cattle, stop your millin' round

It's time to go to sleep

While I tell you bout some secrets

This poor cowboy has to keep

You won't understand, but still I'd like

To get it off my chest

Restless cattle, now it's time to get some rest.


If I show you what I carry

Will you promise not to laugh?

If another tear drop falls and stains

Her faded photograph

Only you know how I feel inside

Only you know that I weep

Restless cattle, settle down, it's time to sleep.


What's this, you've stopped your millin'

Can it be you understand

That a cowboy cries like any other man?

Guess my story must have touched you cause You're all standin' around

Restless cattle, now it's time for beddin' down.


Guess my story must have touched you cause

You're all standin' around

Restless cattle, now it's time for beddin' down.

South of the border, down Mexico way,
That's where I fell in love
When stars above came out to play,
And now as they wander, my thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way.
And she sighed as she whispered ""manana,""
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as I whispered ""manana,""
For our tomorrow never came.
South of the border, I rode back one day.
There in a veil of white by candlelight,
She knelt to pray.
The mission bells told me that I mustn't stay

Marty Robbins,"Take me out of this prison
Back to the clear blue sky
Take me back to the part where this cowboy's heart
Want's to live till I die

Take me back to the prairie
Away from these cold prison bars
By a campfire's gleam let me lie there and dream
Under a blanket of stars

Where each mountain top wears a halo
Of fleecy white clouds overhead
Where symphonys ring from birds on the wing
And the grass is like a soft feather bed

Take me back to the prairie
Back to the land I love best
So that when I am gone I'll be where I belong

A lonely spot I know where no man may go
Where the shadows have all of the room

When a man came along, made me hush my song
Kicked me off away out there

A group of jolly cowboys discussing plans at ease
Said one I'll tell you something, boys, if you will listen, please
I am an old cow puncher and here I'm dressed in rags
I used to be a tough one and go on great big jags

Once I had a home, boys, and a good one you all know
Though I haven't seen it since long long years ago
I'm going back to Dixie once more to see'em all
Yes, I am going home, boys, when the work's all done this fall

Now when I left my home, boys, my Mother for me cried
She begged me not to go, boys, for me she would have died
My Mother's heart is breaking
I've broken it that's all
But with God's help I'll see her when the work's all done this fall

When the roundup days are over and the shipping all is done
I'm going right straight home, boys, before my money's gone
I have changed my way, boys, no more will I fall
Yes, I am going home, boys, when the work's all done this fall

That very night the cowboy went out to stand his guard
The night was dark and cloudy and storming very hard
The cattle they got frightened and rushed in wild stampeed
The cowboy tried to turn them while riding at full speed

While riding in the darkness alone, he did shout
He did his best to head them and turn the herd about
His saddle horse did stumble and on him he did fall
He'll not see his Mother when the work's all done this fall

Boys, send my Mother my wages--the wages I have earned
Cause I am afraid, boys, my last steer I have turned
I'm going to a new range. I hear my Master's call
Yes, I am going home, boys, when the work's all done this fall

Fred, you take my saddle. Jim, you take my bed
Johnny, take my pistol after I am dead
Think about me kindly as you look upon them all
I'll not see my Mother when the work's all done this fall

Charlie was burried at sunrise. No toombstone at his head
Nothing but a thin board, and this is what it said
""poor Charlie died at daybreak. He died from a fall
He'll not see his Mother when the work's all done this fall

Marty Robbins,"How long did you think you could go on hurting me?
And I'd be your fool and wait at home alone
You go out and have your fun like you were free
Tonight I'll have some pleasures of my own

'Cause the shoe goes on the other foot tonight
We'll find out if two wrongs can make a right
Tonight I'll push my heartaches out of sight
'Cause the shoe goes on the other foot tonight

Each time you walk out the door you walk on me
And leave the door wide open for the blues
You fly away from me like you were free
You must think there's wings upon your shoes

But only in my dreams

Can I help it that you broke my heart in two

Though I knew, somehow, this love could never be

It haunts darling even when you're gone
But every time I hold you close a fire stops
To think you chosen me to smile upon

Other arms embraced you every dance
I stood there watching as they crowded around you
I was sure that I didn't stand the chance
It isn't just the way you said I love you so

Now's the time when dreams come driftin' in
Turn the Hi-Fi on play that certain song
One that brings the memories back again

Safe from other lips that tore it all apart
Then I wouldn't hide teardrops deep inside

And dream along when lights are turned down low
When lights are turned down low

Where is the moon that used to glow with love
Where are the stars that used to brightly shine

Where are the dreams that made my life worthwhile

Gone are the vows that were to be for all time
When your love was mine

You left and they came in love vanished with the wind
So here am I, my lonely cry takes me back again
To a time when life was calm
And your love was mine

Is trembling as never before

The lips that have kissed her, that's loved her and missed her
Are lips that have cursed her at night
In anguish and torment I've cursed as the night went
From darkness till dawn's golden light

I've thought of just taking these two hands and breaking
The body I'm waiting to touch
I find while I'm waiting, there's no time for hating
While anticipating
The woman I've wanted so much 

I've placed pretty flowers to brighten the hours
I've put brand new sheets on the bed
I'm nervous, I'm trembling, recalling, remembering
The way that she tosses her head

I've given much thought to the fact that I ought to
Have more control over my life
How can I fight it, how can I deny it,
There's no way to hide it The love that I have for my wife

Marty Robbins,"Out in New Mexico, many long years ago
There in a shack on the desert, one night in a storm
Amid streaks of lightnin' and loud desert thunder
To a young Mexican couple, a baby was born
Just as the baby cried, thunder and lightnin' died
Moon gave it's light to the world and the stars did the same
Mother and Father, both proud of the daughter
That heaven had sent them, Faleena was this baby's name

When she was seventeen, bothered by crazy dreams
She ran away from the shack and left them to roam
Father and Mother, both asked one another
What made her run away, what made Faleena leave home
Tired of the desert nights, poverty, grief and strife
She ran away late one night in the moon's golden gleam
She didn't know where she'd go, but she'd get there
And she would find happiness, if she would follow her dream

After she ran away, she went to Sante Fe
And in the year that she stayed there, she learned about life
In just a little while, she learned that with a smile
She could have pretty clothes, she could be any man's wife
Rich men romanced her, they dined and they danced her
She understood men and she treated them all just the same
A form that was fine and rare, dark shining glossy hair
Lovely to look at Faleena was this woman's name

Restless in Sante Fe, she had to get away
To any town where the lights had a much brighter glow
One cowboy mentioned the town of El Paso
They never stopped dancin' and money like whiskey did flow
She bought a one-way, a ticket from Sante Fe
Three days and nights on a stage with a rest now and then
She didn't mind that, she knew she would find that
Her new life would be more exciting than where she had been

The stage made it's last stop, up there on the mountain top
To let her see all of the lights at the foot of the hill
Her world was brighter and deep down inside her
An uncontrolled beating, her young heart just wouldn't be still
She got a hotel, a room at the Lily Belle
Quickly she changed to a form-fitting black satin dress
Ev'ry man stopped to stare, at this form fine and rare
Even the women remarked of the charm she possessed

Dancin' and laughter, was what she was after
And Rosa's Cantina had lights, with love in the gleam
That's what she hunted and that's what she wanted
Rosa's was one place, a nice girl would never be seen
It was the same way, it was back in Sante Fe
Men would make fools of themselves at the thought of romance
Rosa took heed of, the place was in need of
This kind of excitement, so she paid Faleena to dance

A year passed and maybe more and then through the swingin' doors
Came a young cowboy so tall and so handsomely dressed
This one was new in town, hadn't been seen around
He was so different, he wasn't like all of the rest
Faleena danced close to him, then threw a rose to him
Quickly he walked to her table and there he sat down
And in a day or so, wherever folks would go
They'd see this young cowboy, showin' Faleena the town

Six weeks he went with her, each minute spent with her
But he was insanely jealous of glances she'd give
Inside he was a-hurtin', from all of her flirtin'
That was her nature and that was the way that she lived
She flirted one night, it started a gun-fight
And after the smoke cleared away, on the floor lay a man
Faleena's young lover, had shot down another
And he had to leave there, so out through the back door he ran

The next day at five o'clock, she heard a rifle shot
Quickly she ran to the door, that was facin' the pass
She saw her cowboy, her wild-ridin' cowboy
Low in the saddle, her cowboy was ridin' in fast
She ran to meet him, to kiss and to greet him
He saw her and motioned her back, with a wave of his hand
Bullets were flyin', Feleena was cryin'
As she saw him fall from the saddle and into the sand

Faleena knelt near him, to hold and to hear him
When she felt the warm blood that flowed from the wound in his side
He raised to kiss her and she heard him whisper
""Never forget me, Faleena it's over, goodbye.""
Quickly she grabbed for, the six-gun that he wore
And screamin' in anger and placin' the gun to her breast
Bury us both deep and maybe we'll find peace
And pullin' the trigger, she fell 'cross the dead cowboy's chest

Out in El Paso, whenever the wind blows
If you listen closely at night, you'll hear in the wind
A woman is cryin', it's not the wind sighin'
Old timer's tell you, Feleena is callin' for him
You'll hear them talkin' and you'll hear them walkin'
You'll hear them laugh and you'll look, but there's no one around
Don't be alarmed, there is really no harm there
It's only the young cowboy, showin' Faleena the town",Faleena (From El Paso)

Marty Robbins,"I see a candlelight down in the little green valley
Where Morning Glory vines are twining 'round my door
Oh, how I wish I were there again
Down in the little green valley
That's where my homesick heart will trouble me no more

There's only one thing ever gives me consolation
And that's the thought that I'll be going back someday
And ev'ry night down upon my knees
I pray the Lord to please take me
Back to that little old green valley far away

I hear a mockingbird down in the little green valley
He's singing out a song of welcome just for me
And someone waits by the garden gate
Down in the little green valley
When I get back again, how happy she will be

And by a little babbling brook, once more we'll wander
And in a shady nook, we'll dream the hours away
And I will leave all my cares behind
Go where I know I'll find sunshine

Isn't he too young to be a husband, her a wife?

That lovin' woman with the heart of a child

I want a woman, with a sweet and tender touch
One who will pay the price for love without asking how much
One who will keep me warm when the nights are cold
Face of an angel and heart of gold
That lovin' woman, with a fire down in her soul

Whenever she needs someone to hold her, I'll be there right by her side
Whenever she needs a shoulder to cry on, she can always cry on mine
Through thick and thin together, down the road come rain or shine
I want a woman like that, to be all mine

I want to pack my suitcase and go

Marty Stuart,"There's a girl trying to steal my heart 
And I'm tempted 
Even though she can tear it apart, I'm tempted

Every time she smiles at me 
I know how it could be and I'm tempted 
Each time she looks my way, I'm tempted

Marty Stuart,"An old guitar picker had run out liquor
So I sat down beside him and bought him a drink
I bought him another and finally some color
Returned to his cheeks as he said with a wink 
I worked with Red Foley, knew Hank and ole Lefty
I worked on the Opry back when it was strong
But in showbiz, you know, sometimes it gets slow
So buy us another and I'll sing you a song

Be careful who you love
For love can be untrue
Be careful who you love
Be sure she loves you too

Well, you like that, I see, that's pleasing to me
Son I've wrote hundreds and some you know well
I've wrote 'em and sold 'em, they've bought 'em and stole 'em
Paper is cheap, they're just tunes what the hell

And then he offered to sell me the song he just sung me
I told him that song is a piece of your soul
Keep your song, here's some money
He said ""thank you son"" and I heard him say as I walked out the door

Be careful who you love
For love can be untrue
Be careful who you love
Be sure she loves you too

Well that was about a year ago, now wouldn't you know
It's a big hit some superstar claims he wrote
He sings it and grins and money rolls in
It's a wonder the lyric don't stick in his throat

And I think of that writer named Arthur and wonder
Just how many children he sold in his time
And how many great men take the gift that God gave 'em
And throw it away on the pretty red wine

Be careful who you love
For love can be untrue
Be careful who you love

Right here, oh, ooh, oh, look yonder comin'
Where? Where you comin' from?
Right over there boys, comin' down the railroad track

I said look-a-yonder comin', comin' down the railroad track

I'm goin' down to Florida, gonna get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe California, gotta lose there New York blues

Ride the Orange Blossom Special, now, lose these New York blues
One more time, this song is about a train, ya know
The Orange Blossom Special that used to run from Florida
Up the East Coast and around the East Coast in Virginia

Tater had a little hound dog one time
That played a little bit too close to the train track
And his luck ran out and the train got the hound dog by the tail
Cut his tail off, so Tater, tell 'em a little bit more about your hound dog
A-show 'em how he went, alright

Well, like you said, Marty, he just got to playin' around
A little bit to close to the railroad tracks
Cut about three inches of his tail off, boy, it did hurt
Though I don't know how it would feel but I'm sure it would hurt

He squalled out somethin' like this, he was just a little hound dog right
Really hurt him bad, he turned around about three flips
And took off up towards the house, up through the field there

St. Peter come up to me and he said ""now Marty who do you want to see""
So I began to think
I said ""why don't you call up old Hank Williams and see if he's free""
'Cause Hank saw the world from a Cadillac
And he carried them Lovesick Blues right on his back
Ah yeah

Sure as I was dreaming, sure as I was born
Around my neck came this long skinny arm
And he said, ""Howdy Hoss, my name is Hank, now what brings you here""
So I began to think

I said ""Hank brother, you've seen it all.
You've seen 'em come and go and you've seen 'em rise and fall
And right now country music's got more singers than I believe I've ever seen
So many people got to follow out their dream""
""But I feel different,"" I said, ""'cause I'm a natural born cat
I'm country to the bone, but I don't wear no hat""
Oh no, two three

Said ""I started with Lester back in '72
All I wanted to be was a little different like him and you""
He said ""whoa now, it just takes a little longer to make it if you're different, I guess
But you just sing what's in your heart and God's gonna do the rest
Just be what you are at all times and just tell the folks out there the truth
And that ain't gonna cost you a dime

But if you plan to be different son, you're just rolling the dice
And you know you ain't the first one to pay that price
'Cause there was me and Elvis and there was Bocephus too
There was Waylon and Willie and there was Bill Monroe
And I guess you know about ole Johnny Cash
And I think what the world needs right now is a Jumpin' Jack Flash""

Up in Hillbilly Heaven I saw Keith Whitley, I saw Patsy Cline
I saw Reba McEntire's band, they were all friends of mine
And I began to tremble and I began look
I knew I was dreaming but I just couldn't wake up
Then out of nowhere came this long Cadillac
The driver said ""Now come on there Hank we gotta take you back
Thirty minutes before your next show
We're running behind so we gotta go""
He said ""Marty, I tell you what you do.

You just go on back down there and you make us proud
And remember wherever you go
There's a little hillbilly in every crowd""

Said,""It's time for me to die""

""If I had his money, I could do things my way.""

One rich man in Ten with a satisfied mind.

Once I was winning in fortune and fame;
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in lifes game.
But suddenly it happened, I lost every dime,
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonesome or a love that's grown cold;
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.

My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt. 
But one thing for certain, when it comes my time, 
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.

Marty Stuart,"Here comes the Gospel story of Noah's Ark

When God looked down on this whole world
His heart was heavy and sad
The world He'd made and the man He'd loved
Had all turned wicked and bad

As He looked over His creation
He was grieved by His own plan
But just before He destroyed everything He loved
He found Him a righteous man

Brother Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah was a righteous man
He walked with his God a day by day
Holding to His hand

He worked without ceasin', preached without preachin'
That's a truth that shall ever stand
Brother Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah was a righteous man

Well God said to Noah
""Build a boat and we'll call it an ark
Build it long, deep and wide
I'm gonna tell you before it starts""

""I'm gonna send to you, a two by two
Every good and living thing
But gather up your family and shut the door
'Cause Brother, it's gonna rain""

For forty days and forty nights
The water came a pourin' down
The tears from God Almighty's eyes
Covered everythin' on the ground

Men were screamin', women were cryin'
Noah heard it day and night
But everything on the other side of that door
Disappeared clean out of sight

Brother Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah was a righteous man
He walked with his God a day by day
Holding to His hand

He worked without ceasin', preached without preachin'
That's a truth that shall ever stand
Brother Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah was a righteous man

Alright

And then one day the rain stopped fallin'
And the ark came to a rest
High and dry was ole Brother Noah
On the top of Mount Ararat

Well they opened up the window
And sent the Lord a dove
Well the dove brought back an olive branch
And we all got a bowl of love

Brother Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah was a righteous man
He walked with his God a day by day
Holding to his hand

He worked without ceasin', preached without preachin'
That's a truth that shall ever stand
Brother Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord
Noah was a righteous man

Well, Noah was a righteous man

In first Thessalonians it is read
The 16th verse in chapter four
Now listen friend, let me tell you more

It says the Lord himself is gonna shout
And Gabriel will bring his trumpet out

And then the Saints and Christ shall rise

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Where you passed out on your feet

Spent his Fridays at the gym

I get to hear you say
All that you want to say

Just to get into you now

I watch you up above my bed
I'm taken by your slutty grace
And if they stole your paper face
You know I think I'd rather be dead

Por las noches en su habitación

Porque ella no cree en nada de eso

Que jugaron con su corazon

Y ella no puede olvidar eso

Y aunque es bella, te dice que esos amores
No esta pa' ella

No sigas haciéndole cuentos, porque
Ella a la palabra compromiso esta ajena

No sigas haciéndole cuentos, porque

No quiere compromiso, no hay nadie que la enamore

Que intentarlo nuevamente

Y que nunca jamas cometerìa aquel
Error que tan amargo le saliò
Y la hizo madurar

No puede perdonar, fue tan fuerte el dolor
Que sola a ciegas se mantiene presa
Oculta de cualquier nuevo amor
No siente deseos, ni de solo miradas

Camina siempre asì
Envuelta en su obsesión sin permitir que alguien
Nuevamente intentara obtener su corazon
Sane las heridas; no busca ser amada

I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine

Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

Whenever blue teardrops are fallin'
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby

And honey I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Ohh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing

Get up, get up, get up, get up
Let's make love tonight
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Baby, I got sick this mornin'
A sea was stormin' inside of me
Baby, I think I'm capsizin'
The waves are risin' and risin'

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us

Sexual healing, baby, it's good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
Well, it's good for me and it's so good to me my baby, ohh

Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind, soon we'll be making it, honey
I'll be feeling fine
You're my medicine, open up and let me in

I can't wait for you to operate, baby

I need sexual healing
When I get this feeling

And I need sexual healing, darling

So I'll be around when he's gone.

Good-bye again,
And if you find a love like mine
Just now and then,
Oh drop a line to say your feeling fine

And when things go wrong
Perhaps you'll see
You're meant for me
So I'll be around when he's gone.",I'll Be Around
Marvin Gaye,"From ages to ages the poets and sages,
Of love glorious love always sing,
But ask any lover and you'll soon discover,
The heartaches that romance can bring,

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",When Your Lover Has Gone

Your kisses now are so blase
You're bored with me in every way

Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you

There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""



""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""



",Nature Boy
Marvin Gaye,"Pretend you're happy when you're blue
It isn't very hard to do
And you'll find happiness without an end
Whenever you pretend

Remember anyone can dream
And nothing's bad as it may seem
The little things you haven't got
Could be a lot if you pretend

You'll find a love you can share
One you can call all your own
Just close your eyes, she'll be there
You'll never be alone

And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend
So why don't you pretend?

And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend
So why don't you pretend?",Pretend

Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine

The monkey thought that ev'rything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
But the monkey grabbed his neck and said, now, listen, Jack

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa, don't you blow your top

Ain't no use in divin', what's the use of jivin'
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa, don't you blow your top

The buzzard told the monkey, you're choking me
Release your hold and I'll set you free
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said
Your story's touching, but is sounds like a lie

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and stay right

Marvin Gaye,"In the evening when the sun goes down
Oh, you'll find me hangin' 'round
'Cause the night life ain't no good life
But it's my life, oh yes it is

Many people just like you and me
Are dreamin' about how things used to be
But the nightlife ain't no good life
But it's my life

Listen to the blues they're playin'
Listen to the blues, to what's saying
Hey, yeah

Home, it's just another place

Then again it's happy
Oh, mmm, sometimes",Night Life
Marvin Gaye,"Maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely

just suppose I could love you from the very start, maybe
Heaven knows I could show you with an open heart, baby
You're the one that I've been waiting for
In this loneliness forever more

baby, I know you're the one for me

can it be that you're needing me as I need you, honey?
(promise me)
Promise me if we part and I never knew, funny
Deep inside my heart I hope and pray
That someday you'll come to me and say
""baby, I know you're the one for me""

maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely

love is strong and I'm betting that it will come my way, gladly
If I'm wrong and mistaken, then I'll have to pay, sadly
No other love could ever be the same
If we fail, there's just yourself to blame

oh baby, I know you're the one for me
Maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely
So lonely
Maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely
You're the one for me
You're the one for me
All of my life
You're the one for me
I'll never have another love
You're the one for me
For the rest of my life
You're the one for me

Not knowing if I'd see you again
You've been a long time coming
But, oh, baby, welcome home

Feel, feel kinda, kinda, kinda good right now
Feel so good baby, yeah
You've been a long, real long time coming
But darlin', welcome home

And I'll be doggone if I wouldn't bring you my pay, baby
But if I ever caught you running around
Blowing my money all over this town
Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, hey, I'd be long gone
Then I wouldn't be doggone (wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be long gone, mm-hmm (I'd be long gone)
Now, hey, hey, hey

I'll be doggone if you ain't a pretty thing (baby)
And I'll be doggone if you ain't warm as a breath of spring (baby)
And if we live to be a hundred years old
If you ever let that spring turn cold

Now, did you hear me?
Well, now, what I say?
Oh, believe me

Well, every woman should try to be whatever her man wants her to be
And I don't want much, all I want from you is for you to be true to me

I'll be doggone if love ain't a man's best friend, oh baby (oh, baby)
And I'll be doggone if you ain't the loving end (baby)
Though I know you make me feel like nobody could
If I ever found out that you're no good
Then I wouldn't be doggone (wouldnt be, wouldn't be, wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be long gone (I'd be long gone)
Well, I wouldn't be doggone (wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be long gone (I'd be long gone)

Marvin Gaye,"Oh, one more heartache, I can't take it
My heart is carrying such a heavy load
One more ache would break it
Just like a camel with a heavy pack
One last straw was added
Said it broke the camel's back
Aaah, aaah (aah, aah)
I can't take it

One more heartache
It would turn me right around
First you build my hopes up high
And then let me down
Like the house you built with toothpicks
Stacked upon the kitchen table
One more toothpick tore it down
The foundation was not able
Aaah, aaah (aah, aah)
I can't stand it
No, baby
Oh, believe me

One more heartache
Is too much load
I'm fed up with the heartache
One more and I'll explode
Like a toy balloon that's filled
With as much air as it can take
One more puff of air and that balloon has got to break
Aaah, aaah (aah, aah)
I can't stand it
I can't take it
Oh, baby
Don't do it
Oh, honey, ooh, baby",One More Heartache

Written by: Clarence Paul/Marvin Gaye/Dave Hamilton

Darling, please stay, don't go away
(If you leave me)
What a heartache, for heaven's sake
(Don't you need me?)
Don't leave me blue of wanting you
(How could I live?)
Don't be untrue, what could I do?

CHORUS:
(Don't you know you)
You gave me the world, little girl
When you gave me your love
So if you take your love
You take my world with you too

Hey look at me, now can't you see
(Tears in my eyes)
Hear what I say, stay here, I pray
(Never leave me)
Why must I plead, you know I need
(All your loving)
Don't put me down, keep me around

(chorus)

And I say, baby, pretty little baby
Don't leave me
Baby, pretty little baby

Darlin', you give me your joy, am I your toy
(Cracked and broken)
I always share your every care
(Wishin', hopin')
All through the years we have no fears
(Now I'm cryin')
You leave the tears fallin' for years

(chorus)

And I say, baby, pretty little baby
Don't leave me
Baby, pretty little baby
...and fade











",Pretty Little Baby
Marvin Gaye,"Ooh, you say you're feelin' nervous
The least thing makes you cry
Sounds like a real bad case of a girl who needs a guy
I think I know the perfect jewel
The one you ought to try
Take a heart that's full of love, on this you can rely

And if you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
And if you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
And if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
I think I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine

I may not be a doctor who can cure your ills
Goodbye to all those different drugs and hard-to-swallow pills
My remedy is older than the tale of Jack and Jill
My prescription is the kind you love to have refilled

If you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
If you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
Baby, if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
Honey, I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine

Got a lovin' side (this heart of mine)
That's pure as gold (this heart of mine)
Take it, it's yours (this heart of mine)
Have and to hold (this heart of mine)
And if you do that, baby (this heart of mine)
After we grow old (this heart of mine)
We'll have the greatest love story (this heart of mine)
That was ever told (this heart of mine)
Oh, baby (greatest story that was ever told)

Oh, medicine won't cure you
Just relieve you at the most
But relief is only temporary, pretty soon it'll go
But love can last a lifetime
When two hearts are close
Take as much as you want to, there is no overdose

If you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
Baby, if you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
If you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine, take it, baby",Take This Heart of Mine
Marvin Gaye,"Ooh, everyday, there's something new (oh, baby)
Honey, to keep me loving you (oh, honey)
And with every passing minute
Oh baby, so much joy wrapped up in it (sugar)
Oh, heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love

Oh, and now, I've got a song to sing
Tellin' the world about the joy you bring (sweetheart)
And you gave me reason for living
And ooh, you taught me
You taught me the meaning of giving

Oh-oh, heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love, oh
To find a love like yours is rare these days
'Cause you've shown me what happiness is in so many ways
I look in the mirror and I'm glad to see
Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be

What you've given me I could never return (baby)
'Cause there's so much, girl, I've yet to learn
And I want to show my appreciation
'Cause when I found you
I found a new inspiration

But in my menory,
We always will be together.

Without leavin' the ground
Rest of the folks are tired and weary
And have laid their bodies down

I go to the place
Where danger waits
And it's bound to
Forsake me

So stupid minded
But I go crazy when I can't find it

In the mornin'
I'll be alright my friends
Soon the night will
Bring the pains again

Ooh, flyin' hight in the friendly sky
Without ever leavin' the ground
Ain't seen nothin' but trouble baby
Paraphernalia is my name

There's a place
Where the feelin' awaits me
Self-destruction's
In my hands

So stupid minded
But I go crazy when I can't find it

Who makes slaves out of men

Nobody understood

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

You did not understand
You just ran away from me

Oh I missed you baby
Ooh I missed you baby, I miss you
You're the best I ever had
You're so bad baby
But I must like you like that
Although you won't let me control this or that
Constantly playin' this tit for tat

Ah now I see you're comin' straight to the point
You say the more you get baby
Ah the more you want me
Yeah darlin' you're not wastin' my time
What I see baby is so hard to find

Although you've been all over town baby
Havin' your affairs I still have to accept you back
Angel though you're promiscuous
I don't mind a bit 'cause you're still the greatest lay
Even when you're miles away

Girl if you run away again
Surely my heart would never mend
Don't tell me the love we made
Was just for old time's sake
Stayin' up waitin' for you to come home at night
Was just so hard to take
She said that pain might never mend
So let's be sometime lovers and
Oh baby that's when my poor heart broke up

So if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
Well if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
If you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
If you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life

I knew right then and there, this is where I wanted to be.
Most of my life I had been all, all alone,
And you're so sweet to me; don't think I'll ever roam.
And then one day as time will pass,
I had this feeling that our love would last.
Nothing could go wrong, and it seemed everything I did 
Seemed to please you; all the heartaches you hid.
Then one night after we made it, and we were through,
That's when I decided I wanted to marry you.
Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife;
To love, hold, and cherish, for the rest of your life?
I do, yes I do, I do darlin',
Cause I love you.
Nineteen sixty-four.
Once you really loved me,
Once I really loved you.
Nineteen seventy-six.

As time would really change me.

We were over Gwen's
And we was trying one more time to make amends
Oh yes we was
Suddenly it occured to me it did not matter
Whether I was mad at her
Or she was mad at me
Naw, babe
Understanding my condition
I must surely be a wishing
And a hoping to be free

Some say, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
Yeah, she said, you can leave, but it's gonna cost you dearly, oh
You can leave, but it's going to cost you, hah, dearly

Sometimes your eyes was red as fire
Intoxicated
Sometimes your spirit was moving on me
Begun to fight me
I had to fight to defend my life
I think I minded
See I've finded
I think I've stimulated
That after fighting
We're making love
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby
Cause after all, you was my wife

Hey, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She would try to put me down, she used to bully
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
I used to sing this song and dance around
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
Mr. man, what's going down

That young girl is going to cost you
If you want happiness, you got to pay
Oooh baby, used to be the apple of my eye
I come to love you fool
I come to love you baby
You used to be my heart's desire
My heart's desire, yeah

I'm gone, get used to it, baby

I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it

You tried to have them shut me
Bring me
Tell me what for
So I'd satisfy you baby
You have won the battle
Oh but Daddy's gonna win the war
But Mommy's worked so hard
Tryin'a take my riches
Rich things, too
Being trying to sell my
Oh I tried to communicate
Tryina set my woman
Salmon in my soul
But I was strong, baby
Stood my ground and prayed
Put a lot to work

To upset the judge

You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you

You use to say that I was a gorgeous hunk of man
That didn't help me baby
Ah, when you was on the stand","You Can Leave, But It's Gonna Cost You"
Marvin Gaye,"You know, when you say your marriage vows
They´re supposed to be for real
I mean...
If you think back about what you really said
You know, about, honor and loving 
And obeying till death do us part and all 
But it shouldn´t be that way, it should... 
It should, it shouldn´t be lies because it turns out to be lies 
If you don´t honor what you said, you lie to God 
The words should be changed

Ooo now as I recall, we tried a million times
Again and again and again, and that isn´t all
I gave my love to you each time to make amends
Suddenly I start to realize I can´t make it
Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health´s sake
What to do? Make you pay, for leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in, I won´t say those words again
Instead I´ll say I´ll try to love and protect you
With all my heart as long as you want me to baby

Ooo if I love again I´m gonna try a new way this time
Memories of the things we did, some we´re proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger
Do you remember all of the bullshit, baby?
You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me will all of your heart
You´d never take a million dollars to part
I really tried, you know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried, all of those promises was nothin´ but lies
I really tried, you know how I really tried, we really lied, didn´t we baby?
And on top of that you have scandalized my name
What I can´t understand is if you love me
How could you turn me into the police?
Didn´t I love you good and try to take care of you?
Best that I could
You were so divine
And your love was like mellow wine
Pains of love, miles of tears, 
Enough to last me for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years, soon break away to the noonday sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend, I´ll never be back again
But I´m not really bitter babe
I wish you all the luck and all the love in the world, 
Good love in the world (good luck in the world)
But I know you´ll never be satisfied
No, you still want me standin´ by your side

Memories haunt you all the time, I will never leave your mind
Got judgement on your side,
You´ve said bad things and you´ve lied
Still I remember some of the good things baby
Like love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I´ll not forget in my life
I´d rather remember, remember the joy we shared babe
I´d rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was to love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight
It don´t matter baby, take a lesson from them all
I never thought I´d see the day 
When you´d put me through what you put me through
You tried your best, you say I gave you no rest

When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?","When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You [Leon Ware & Ge"

It injures me, babe

Anger, can make you old, yes it can
I said anger, can make you sick children, oh Jesus
Anger destroy your soul

Rage, there's no room for rage in there
There's no room for rage in here
Line up some place to go to be mad
It's a sin to treat your body bad

When anger really gets the best of us
We've really lost our heads
We often say a lof of things, oh darlin'
Wish we'd never said

Oh, reason is beyond control
And the things we do for spite
Makes me ashamed for my meanness, baby
Makes me want to the things right

Someday soon I hope and pray like Jesus
I'll reach that wiser age
Hope I will learn I really never never profit
From things I do in rage

One more time anger, more anger
When it's flaming hot
Anger burns to the bitter end
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout

And when it cools I find out too late
I have lost at love, love, love, dear friend

I said, anger will make you sick children, oh Jesus
Anger destroy your soul

I ain't gonna let you get the best of me, babe
I'm gonna go somewhere and cool
This is not the way my head's supposed to be, babe
You've got me feelin' like some silly fool

But I know a real nice place where I can go
And feel the way I'm supposed to feel

I don't want to be feelin' bad

It's never hard to get it up for you
Why did you have it and is it all the same

Oh my sweet darling did you forget your name
oh you call it a thrill
I never knew, and then you never will
Oh one big mistake now I see

I started off thinking that you belonged to me
Cold blooded lovers waiting for the night
Exploring my treasure, got me so uptight
Your fault that I'm

Feeling all insane
Once we were happy
And then the devil came
Oh baby, oh baby

First you make believe your mine
Oh babe, oh baby
Then you make me feel like dying. Ooh ooh
Once upon a time you said I set your soul on fire

I called you my honey
You were my one desire
I let you nestle too deep within my soul
I can't believe I let you take control

Oh my sweet baby don't wait too late
Tell me you love me and cure my heart ache
I never thought I'd be put in this squeeze
Your trying to bring me to my bended knee

Don't start buggin'
Don't criticize
Folks that love you
Right before your eyes

Got to let you go
Got to be heard
Got to love you so

Got to give you some

Ok let me hear that back

I can understand it

I got the baddest cool, could never be the fool, the ladies wait to get down with me
The love I make superb, to doubt me is absurd, the ladies say I'm the greatest you see
I want to have your spot, and more than what you got, I bought the baddest house I could find
All it must be said I'm greatest in the bed and when I love a lady she's mine
I know I'm really hot, my diamonds shine a lot, check out here this 450 SE babe
I'm what's its all about

Without a doubt, I know we ego tripping out, sometimes it's a shame
But it caused so much pain, don't want you baby
I know you ego tripping out, 'times it's a shame but it can't do without
Without a doubt, I know your ego tripping out, hey she don't know it
Ain't it a shame all the pain to come

I'm better than the rest, check out the way I dress and got a lot of money to spend
The best club in town, is where I get down, your lucky if I choose you my friend
Walk the greatest walk, I got to be the talk, I've got the greatest show in town
Woo hoo rock with other men then roll over to me so I can trill your soul baby
Aw check out the love mink standing tall in bold can fulfill your needs into the cold baby
Needless to say I'm your greatest play
Ego tripping out, oh, ego tripping out,
Yeah, ego tripping out

In my mind what it's for
Got a sweet tooth for the chick on the floor
Walking in my shoes
Walking to the beat
Still got some love inside
Some good old body heat

Oh baby
Spread the news
Only here to deepen my soul
No it ain't about money

Won't fulfill the need

Some of us were born for races to win
Some of us are aware that it's good for us to care
Some of us feel the icy wind of poverty blowin' in the air

For those of us who tend the sick

Who really cares?
To save a world in despair
There'll come a time, when the world won't be singin'
Flowers won't grow, bells won't be ringin'
Who really cares?
Who's willing to try to save a world
That's destined to die
When I look at the world it fills me with sorrow
Little children today are really gonna suffer tomorrow
Oh what a shame, such a bad way to live
All who is to blame, we can't stop livin'
Live, live for life
But let live everybody
Live life for the children
Oh, for the children
You see, let's save the children
Let's save all the children
Save the babies, save the babies
If you wanna love, you got to save the babies

Without a doubt, I know your ego tripping out, hey she don't know it
Ain't it a shame all the pain to come

The best club in town, is where I get down, your lucky if I choose you my friend
Walk the greatest walk, I got to be the talk, I've got the greatest show in town
Woo hoo rock with other men then roll over to me so I can fill your soul baby

Get in the groove and boogie to the beat baby

Let's party baby, shake it, shake it
Party night to remember
Oh, everybody's having fun
Come on and party turn the green light on

When I saw you
I had to stop
I had to stop in the middle of a bop
I had to stop
I got the rhythm

Love is everywhere for the making
Freaks is everywhere for the taking
Blues is in the air if you sing it
Happiness come back if you bring it
I'm having me a good time

I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawaves crashin
While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run

Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying

Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain?

Ain't that peculiar?
A peculiar-arity
Ain't that peculiar, baby?
Peculiar as can be

Oh, you tell me lies that should be obvious to me
But I'm so much in love with you, baby, 'till I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger? (stronger, stronger, stronger)

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe, baby, you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears? (tears, tears, tears)

In the palm of my hand

Like my own reflection
You were always there

My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake, baby was to give you all

You were sweeter
Then my very own kin
But what did I do for you
Not a thing
In front of my friends
You broke me down
Since then darling
It's hard to track you down

My mistake was to love you, boy
Love you, boy
My mistake was to give my all
Tell the world

Many a smile
You put on my face
But I paid dearly
With the tears I taste

My tenderness
Made you cold, not sweet
'Cause if a girl loves you
You only call her weak

I took a walk into the park and never saw the children play.
Everything I see is a crazy kind of mystery to me.
I'm flirting with the mother of insanity.
Oh, babe, where is my mind?
Since you left me it's been hard to find.
Oh where, where is my mind?
It started to rain, and I felt insane,
But one thing's for sure:
It's going to rain forever more
Until you come back to me.
Please, babe
World, I'm not the same.
I go somewhere and can't remember how I came.
I'm completely turned around, lost in space.
It's your face I see constantly.
I never know from right or wrong, or anything.
I'm like a desperate man,
Just see me try to cling
To the only other parts you've left to me.
I'm flirting, I'm flirting with uncertainty.
Oh, bring back my mind.
Since you left me, honey,
I can't find it.

There's no thrill without you, darlin'
Like a sea without a shore
Kicking forever more

Keep on lovin' me honey, don't you change your mind
Sugar, I can't bear the thought of ever leavin' you behind
No matter what I do, another you I'll never find
So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause I would stop right where I stand
I'd be the frame of a man
Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe
If you leave you might as well take the air I breathe

Marvin Gaye,"Today I saw somebody
Who looked just like you
He walked like you do

You are everything
And everything is you
Oh, you are everything
And everything is you
'Cause you are everything

How can I forget
When each face that I see
Brings back memories
Of being with you
I just can't go on
Living life as I do
Comparing each girl with you
Knowing they just won't do
They're not you

Marvin Gaye,"Ooh, once I thought that
Love was a toy for girls and boys
I never gave my heart
I just played the part right from the start

Then there was you, sweet you
With a love that I knew, I knew was true
But in my pride, I left you, baby
Oh, just hangin' on, now love has gone

Oh, only a lonely man would know
The bitter tears I've cried since I lost you darlin'
Since you said goodbye

Only a lonely man would know
The hurt inside of me, since I left my pride
Make a fool of me

Ask any lonely man, you see, darlin'
Walk up and ask any lonely man like me, baby

Ooh, foolishly girl, I broke your heart
Now we're apart
Now, in my lonely room, I
Just reminisce, long for your kiss

And through my lonely tears
I can see ahead long lonely years
Without your love
My world, my world's at an end

Blinds closin' in, now, I know
Oh, what I was too slow in learnin'
Oh, now I know
No that I'm all alone, my heart is yearnin'

The bitter tears I've cried since I lost you darlin'
Since you said goodbye

Ask any lonely man, you see, baby

Ain't nothing like the real thing.
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,
So let's get together.

If I had a voice instead
And the part of me that holds my love for you

If my heart could sing
I'd sing a song that all the world could feel
One that each word a thought would bring
If my heart could sing, sing

I'd sing of love to tell my story
A how love brought me you
And like a bell I'd toll and ring
If my heart could sing

Things I'd felt along the way
But my lips can't speak the magic words
That my heart alone can say

I don't care to know how far I have to fly
I don't care to know how many stars are in the sky

Will you love me forever, never let me go?
Oh Tammi! 
Yeah Marvin?

Till my heart stands still, oh Tammi!
Oh Marvin, tell me why do you love me?

I was just a rollin' stone goin' nowhere
Empty like a hollow room filled with despair
Then, like a rainbow and a pot of gold
You came into my life and you saved my very soul
Can't help but love you, can't help but love you, baby
Can't help but love you
Tell me, why do you love me?

I was so alone like a leaf without a tree
When out of the darkness your love lifted me
And I'm so grateful, baby I'm so glad
'Cause your sweet sweet love is the best I've ever had

Can't help but love you, can't help but love you, baby

Marvin Gaye,"Childhood part of my life, it wasn't very pretty.
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.
It was hard times,
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.
Listen!  my father didn't know the meaning of work,
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine.
Let me tell you about cloud nine.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be
(cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free
(cloud nine)  and you're a million miles from reality.
I wanna say I love the life I live,
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.
I'm riding high
On cloud nine, you're as free as a bird in flight
(cloud nine)  there's no diff'rence between day and night
(cloud nine)  it's a world of love and harmony
(cloud nine)  you're a million miles from reality.

Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be

Little girl, all the love I've got

The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.
Oh, let it rain.

Til' it rains I'm gonna stay inside and let it rain.",I Wish It Would Rain [Single Remix Version]

There's a heavy, heavy shadow hanging over me
Yesterday, came all too suddenly

Oh, why did she have to go?
I don't know
Tell you, I don't know

I must have, must have said something wrong
Now I long, long, long for yesterday

Oh, talkin' about yesterday

Now I need a place to hide away

Without leaving the ground
Rest of the folks are tired and weary
And have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger waits
And its bound to forsake me

So stupid minded
But I go crazy, when I cant find it

In the morning I'll be alright my friends
Soon the night will bring the pains again

Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground
Ain't seen nothing but trouble baby paraphernalia is my name
There's a place where the feeling awaits me
Self-destructions in my hands

So stupid minded
But I go crazy, when I can find it

I know I'm hooked my friends
To the boy

Marvin Gaye,"Up and down my back, my spine, in my brain
It injures me, babe...

Anger, can make you old, yes it can
I said anger, can make you sick, children... oh Jesus
Anger destroys your soul
Rage, there's no room for rage in there
There's no room for rage in here
Line up some place to go to be mad
It's a sin to treat your body bad

When anger really gets the best of us
We've really lost our heads
We often say a lof of things, oh darlin'
Wish we'd never said
Oh, reason is beyond control
And the things we do spite
Makes me ashamed
And I mean this, baby, makes me want to the things right

Someday soon I hope and pray like Jesus
I'll reach that wiser age
Hope I will learn I really never never profit
From things I do in rage

One more time-anger, more anger
When it's flaming hot
Anger burns to the bitter end
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
When it cools I find out too late
I have lost at love, love, love, dear friend
I said, anger will make you sick,
Children, oh Jesus
Anger destroys your soul

I ain't gonna let you get the best of me, babe
I'm gonna go somewhere and cool
This is not the way my head's supposed to be, babe
You've got me feelin' like some silly fool
But I know a real nice place where I can go
And feel the way I'm supposed to feel

I don't want to be mad at nobody
I don't want to be feelin' bad
Up and down my back, my spine, in my brain
It injures me, babe

Is it right to be left alone
When the one you love is never home
I love too hard my friends sometimes say
But I believe I believe that a woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside to see you treat me so unkind
Somebody somewhere tell her it's unfair

Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness
Somebody

Is it right to be treated so bad
When you give her everything you had
Keep on talking in my sleep
'cause I haven't seen my baby all week
Now you kids you agree that
This ain't the way love's supposed to be
Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah

Up early in the morning with her on my mind
Took to find it out all night I been cryin'
But I believe a woman's a man's best friend
I'm gonna stick by her till the very end
Well she causes so much misery
That I forgot how love's supposed to be
Somebody somewhere tell her it ain't fair

Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness
I want a witness
Witness, witness

Everybody knows especially you girls
That a love can be sad
But I have a love that's twice as bad

And there's no love left (there's no love left)

Hey, don't know why I failed
For you I've always cared
I did all I know to win your love and make it so
Always stay but you turned away
Honey, what could I say?
How could you, how could you, how could you do me this way?

Somehow it all went wrong
Somewhere down the line
The love I lost, I've got to find
(Whoah, and it won't be long)
Gonna make it right, baby (gonna make it right, baby)
And carry you tenderly back home

Haven't been the perfect guy
For a girl as sweet as you but my heart and soul cries out to you

Marvin Gaye,"I used to go out to parties
And stand around
'Cause I was too nervous
To really get down

But my body yearned to be free
I got up on the floor and found
Someone to choose me

No more standin' along the side walls
Now I've got myself together, baby
And I'm havin' a ball
Long as you prove it
There's always a chance
Somebody watches
Might wanna make romance

Move your body, ooo baby, you dance all night
To the groove and feel all right
Everybody's groovin' on like a fool
But if you see me, top down, let me in
Baby just party high and low
Let me step into your erotic zone

Move it up
Turn it 'round
Ooo shake it down
Owwww

You can love me when you want to babe
This is such a groovy party baby
We're here face to face
Everybody's swingin'
This is such a groovy place
All the young ladies are so fine!
You're movin your body easy with no doubts
I know what you thinkin' baby
You wanna turn me out
Think I'm gonna let you do it babe

Got to give it up

Marvin Gaye,"I guess I'd have to say this album is
Dedicated to you.
Although perhaps you may not be happy,
This is what you want,
So I conceded.
I hope it makes you happy.
There's a lot of truth in it, babe.

I don't think I'll have many regrets, baby.
Things didn't have to be the way they was, baby.
You don't have the right to use the son of mine
To keep me in line.
One thing I can't do without
Is the boy whom God gave to both of us.
I'm so happy, oh, for the son of mine.

So here it is, babe.
I hope you enjoy, reminisce, be happy,
Think about the kisses and the joy.
But there were those other moments too,
The times that were cloudy and grey.
Bad.
But you taught me that was life.
May love ever protect you,
May peace come into your life.
Always think of me the way I was.
Ha, I was your baby.

This is what you wanted.
Here, dear, here it is.
Here, my dear, here it is.","Here, My Dear"

Maybe I'll awake and find that I'm mistaken

Marvin Gaye,"Now you're moving on up, pretty baby
You're leaving me behind
Everybody seems to love you
Oh, you're doing just fine, fine, fine
But take away your good looks
And all your fancy clothes
Why don't you just
(Try) try it, baby
(Try) try it, baby
(Try) try it, baby
(Try) try it, baby
You'll see
That nobody loves you but me (nobody but me)

Now, you tell me that you're so busy, pretty baby
You ain't got much time
Oh, how well I remember
When all your time was mine, mine, mine
Well, move on back cross the track, baby
Where you came from
Why don't you just
(Try) try it, baby
(Try) try it, baby
(Try) try it, baby
(Try) try it, baby
You'll see
That nobody loves you but me (nobody but me)
Nobody loves you but me (nobody but me)

I really want to hold you, pretty baby
In my arms again
But I can't get close to you
For all your loving friends, friends, friends
But take your name from the bright lights, baby (take it from the lights)
And tell me that you are all through (tell them you are through
Come on and
(Try) try it, honey
(Try) try it, baby
(Try) try it, sweetheart

You'll see that nobody loves you but me (nobody but me)

Marvin Gaye,"You know, when you say your marriage vows
They're supposed to be for real
I mean
If you think back about what you really said
You know, about, honor and loving
And obeying 'till death do us part and all
But it shouldn't be that way, it should
It should, it shouldn't be lies because it turns out to be lies
If you don't honor what you said, you lie to God
The words should be changed

Ooo now as I recall, we tried a million times
Again and again and again, and that isn't all
I gave my love to you each time to make amends
Suddenly I start to realize I can´t make it
Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health's sake
What to do? Make you pay, for leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in, I won´t say those words again
Instead I'll say I'll try to love and protect you
With all my heart as long as you want me to baby

Ooo if I love again I´m gonna try a new way this time
Memories of the things we did, some we´re proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger
Do you remember all of the bullshit, baby?
You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me will all of your heart
You'd never take a million dollars to part
I really tried, you know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried, all of those promises was nothin' but lies
I really tried, you know how I really tried, we really lied, didn't we baby?
And on top of that you have scandalized my name
What I can´t understand is if you love me
How could you turn me into the police?
Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you?
Best that I could
You were so divine
And your love was like mellow wine
Pains of love, miles of tears,
Enough to last me for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years, soon break away to the noonday sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend, I'll never be back again
But I´m not really bitter babe
I wish you all the luck and all the love in the world
Good love in the world (good luck in the world)
But I know you´ll never be satisfied
No, you still want me standin' by your side

Memories haunt you all the time, I will never leave your mind
Got judgement on your side,
You've said bad things and you've lied
Still I remember some of the good things baby
Like love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I'll not forget in my life
I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared babe
I'd rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was to love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight
It don't matter baby, take a lesson from them all
I never thought I'd see the day
When you´d put me through what you put me through
You tried your best, you say I gave you no rest

When did you stop loving me?

But listen baby, as long as I got you

No struggle or strife today
You're my lucky charm, my guiding star

Oh, your tenderness and sweet caress

Marvin Gaye,"As the bitter tears fall from your eyes 
a thousand times you ask yourself why 
the one guy you love has departed 
and you're left alone and broken hearted.
Love just comes and it goes.

I know you're walkin' down a lonesome road 
and your heart is carryin' a heavy load.
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend 
and your whole world is cavin' in.
Now's the time to be strong, 
you gotta forget him now that he's gone, 
and remember.
 
That's The Way Love Is, baby, 
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
That's The Way Love Is, sugar,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
 
The road of love gets rough some times don't let it get the best of you.
Said I've been hurt by love so many times,
so I know just what you're goin' through.
You wish that you were never born, you gotta forget him now that he's gone, 
just Remember.

Cause you're still the greatest lay even when you're miles away

Was just for old times sake

I see you, I see your face
And inside me is a growing need for your embrace
In the light of day, though our faces meet
Someone there might see someone else speak
Till the dark of night, while the moon is new
While we whisper words of love in our secret rendezvous
Somethin's wrong I know, girl I love you so
Yes I need you, I need you baby
Oh you, my sweetest joy
You can afford the best of life
I'm just a heartbreakin' boy
Oh you've given your love to me
Girl, I can't let you hurt yourself by being seen with me
We're worlds apart, so close yet very far
So we must hide the love we're feelin' in our hearts
We meet in shadows, your friends must never know
That we are lovers, darlin'
Although it hurts me so, for your sake no one must see
The press of love you're givin' me
But you know, I need you baby

One day I'll make the break, my love will start to shine
I can tell the world that you are mine, all mine
Till then we must go on the way we have before
And never let it show without each other's souls

Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say

I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

In the palm of my hand

Like rain to sand
At the beginning
When I didn't care
Like my own reflection
You were always there

Not a thing
In front of my friends
You broke me down

Love you, boy
My mistake was to give my all

You put om ny face
But I paid dearly
With the tears I taste

Made you cold, not sweet

You only call her weak

So mean and cruel

Treat every moment that I spent with you
I treasure every like it was a precious jewel

Marvin Gaye,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true

Marvin Gaye,"Now come and listen to my story
A story that I know is true
A little rose that bloomed in Georgia
With hair of gold and a heart so true

Way down in the blue ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
Lives my sweetheart of the mountains
She's my little Georgia rose

Her mother left her with another
A carefree life she had planned
The baby now she is a lady
The one her mother couldn't stand

We often sing those songs together
I watched her do her little part
She smiled at me when I would tell her
That she was my sweetheart",Georgia Rose [Live][#]

Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Was so inviting

Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Marvin Gaye,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

And then there's a joy,
Oh my darling, of a crying baby
And the joy of a child that's born to you
Then there's a joy of a beautiful lady and the joy of the morning dew
It's something like the joy of loving you baby
Joy of dancin' too
It's something like the joy of lovin' you baby, yeah
Joy of being with you

And it feels like home

In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying

Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem

Marvin Gaye,"Do you wanna do it let's it get it on
But how you gonna act this time around
Before I take it off down to the skin
Let's get an understanding

Girl you didn't understand my philosophy
You did not understand
You just ran away from me
Oh, I miss you baby

Ohh I miss you baby, I miss you
You're the best I ever had
You're so bad baby
But I must like you like that

Although you won't let me control this or that
Constantly playing this tit for tat
Ah now I see you're coming straight to the point
You say the more you get baby

Ah, the more you want me
Yeah, darling you're not wasting my time
What I see baby is so hard to find
Although you've been all over town baby

Having your affairs, I still have to accept you back
Angel though you're promiscuous I don't mind a bit
Cause you're still the greatest lay even when you're miles away
Girl if you run away again

Surely my heart would never mend
Don't tell me the love we made
Was just for old times sake
Staying up waiting for you to come home at night

Was just so hard to take
She said that pain might never mend
So let's be sometime lovers
Oh, baby that's when my poor heart broke up

Well, if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life",All the Way 'Round [Live]
Marvin Gaye,"This is a story about two lovers who shouldn't have been
They did their thing, went their separate ways again
Then by chance, they happen to meet at the neighborhood dance
Got that feeling all over again

He said, ""How much have you missed me since I had you?
How much? Ooh baby, how much? [Incomprehensible]
Oh, I really wondered, oh baby
Wondered if you remember baby, how could you [Incomprehensible]?
Such a thrill, but it's been so hard since I had you, baby

Oh baby, come on, give me a break
Cause it's been so hard, since I had you, baby

Oh, my eyes must look serious
Cause when I look at you, I get delirious, baby
Your voice sounds so serious
But since we're still friends
Let me make love to you again, baby

Don't make me wait so hard
Since I had your sugar, oh baby
Don't make me wait, 'cause it's been so hard
Since I had you baby, ooh, oh baby

Oh baby, still you look good, sugar, you look so fine
Still I love you baby, you know, I gotta tell you right now
I must have been a fool that ever let you go without even thinkin'
'Bout the hard, hard, hard, decision, oh, so glad to see you, baby
Let me take you home, let me tell you how I feel about it really, baby

Oh, since I had you, girl, I haven't wanted no other lover
Since I had you, honey, there hasn't been no other lover
Baby, no other lover

Since I think you're a lover, darling, I haven't wanted no other lover
Since, since I [Incomprehensible] to me baby, I ain't have no other girl
Or no other woman, but you baby

I come up hard baby, but that's okay
'Cause trouble man, don't get in my way

Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I got your picture hangin' on the wall
It can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame

I read your letters when you're not near
But they don't move me
And they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I play the game, a fantasy
I pretend but I'm not in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So let's stay together

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you phone
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of being there

So glad we got the real thing, baby
So glad we got the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing",Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing Baby

And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing

Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

Whenever blue teardrops are fallin'
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby

And honey I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Ohh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing

Get up, get up, get up, get up
Let's make love tonight
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you do it right

Baby, I got sick this mornin'
A sea was stormin' inside of me
Baby, I think I'm capsizin'
The waves are risin' and risin'

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing

And stand around
'Cause I was too nervous
To really get down

So I got up on the floor and found
Someone to choose me
No more standin' along the side walls
Now I've got myself together, baby
And I'm havin' a ball

Marvin Gaye,"Oh, it's over, it's all over
Said it's over, it's all over, baby
I gotta get away from you as fast as I can
You're too much for me, woman
More than my heart can stand
Like a kid behind the wheel
You've been reckless with my heart
If I stayed around
You'd surely tear it all apart
The road has got to end somewhere
Woman, woman, every road has got to end somewhere
Now is the time for the showdown
So let me give you the lowdown
We've come to the end of our road
Woman, I'm just thinkin' 'bout all the times you promised to call
and I sat at home lonely
You only did it 'cause you knew I love you only
Runnin', runnin' around with every guy in town
I'm tellin' you, woman, no longer will I be your clown
The road has got to end somewhere
Every road has got to end somewhere
I'm tired of your stuff
Say enough is enough
We've come to the end of our road
I can't take it no more
Woman, there's no sense in you beggin' and pleadin'
To hold on when I'm the one you're leavin'
Say I've 'bout had my fill of you (had my fill of you)
Flirtin's all through the years
And I've almost run out of tears
I'm tellin' you, I couldn't cry if I wanted to
The road has got to end somewhere
Every road has got to end somewhere
Time and again I've begged you to slow down

Marvin Gaye,"Oh well, oh well, I feel so good today
We touched ground on an international runway
Jet propelled back home, from over the seas to the U. S. A.

New York, Los Angeles, oh, how I yearned for you
Detroit, Chicago, Chattanooga, Baton Rouge
Let alone just to be at my home back in ol' St. Lou

Did I miss the skyscrapers, did I miss the long freeway?
From the coast of California to the shores of Delaware Bay
You can bet your life I did, till I got back to the U. S. A.

Looking hard for a drive-in, searching for a corner café
Where hamburgers sizzle on an open grill night and day
Yeah, and a juke-box jumping with records like in the U.S.A.

Well, I'm so glad I'm livin' in the U.S.A.
Yes. I'm so glad I'm livin' in the U.S.A.

Marvin Goldstein,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem
Marvin Goldstein,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Marvin Hamlisch,"Some sign of forgiveness 
 Some form of release 
 Is all that she asks for 
 Is all that she needs

 She feels more at ease

 Burn bright in the past

 They won't last 
 They don't last 
 You're wasting the moment 
 Biding your time

 So close you can taste it

Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, you're the best

I wasn't lookin' but somehow you found me
It tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me
The spy who loved me
Is keepin' all my secrets safe tonight

And nobody does it better
Though sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Why'd you have to be so good?

The way that you hold me
Whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from runnin'
But just keep it comin'
How'd you learn to do the things you do?

Oh, and nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest

Marvin Holladay,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

sans clim’, sans doutes

comme dépassés par le présent
On a écrit au futur sur les murs  cru au cristal, aux bonnes aventures

Marvin Jouno,"J’aimerais tant rêver,
Etre prisonnier de l’oreiller.
Chuter, tomber puis me cogner,
Dans le cadre du lit, me réveiller ;
Allumer la lampe à mon chevet,
Pousser d’un geste le cendrier.
Sentir le frais me rhabiller,
Poser mes pieds sur le parquet.

D’ici deux heures, tout sera éteint.
Dix pour la grande, la petite près du un.
Dis si tu veux, que c’est lâche, que c’est chien.
Dis si tu peux, que là où j’erre, je vais bien.

J’aimerais tant rester,
Etre passionné par ces contrées,
Lutter, y croire, ne pas connaitre la vérité ;
T’écrire cette lettre sans la gommer.
Ravir tes souvenirs puis m’effacer,
Teinter mes restes et leur fumée,
Essuyer ma peine sur le plancher.

La tempe posée sur le palier,
Je vois les pieds du brancardier.
Une larme blanche fuit ma cornée.
J’entends pleurer…
J’entends parler, je suis cité.

Si je me tue. Votre monde n’existe plus.",Larme blanche

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

Your grace and mercy brought me through,
If it wasn't for Your love, 
Tell me what would I do?

Your blood redeemed me, 
Made me brand new,
It was Your grace and mercy 
That brought me through.

[Verse 1:]
I know that I don't deserve 
All the things that You've done,
You keep blessing me over and over again.

I once was lost deep in sin, 
'til I heard Your voice,
Saying, ""you're my child, come on in"";
It was Your grace...

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2:]
You see, I'm not what I want to be, 
But I'm not what I used to be,
Since He cleansed and made me whole.

I've got to press towards the mark 
For the prize of the high calling,
Which is in Christ, Jesus,
I cannot be left behind.

[Bridge:]
('Cause everyday that I wake up) Your grace,
(it's Your way of telling me) and mercy,
(that You love me so) love me so.

(And every thing that I give up) Your grace,

(that You live in me and I've been set free).

Just remember 
He will put it back together don't you worry 
No need to be in a hurry 
Have patience, He will see you through

I really got a testimony 
You see the devil thought he really, really had me 
But I'm here to let him know 
I'm still standing 
And I've learned, how to trust and wait on Jesus 
Tho I know he will give me the power 
So I keep the faith and know that joy will come 

When things are good, when things are bad 
When I'm happy when I'm sad, I'm gonna wait

Marvin Sapp,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",The Hymns Medley: I Need Thee Every Hour/Bless the Lord/Can't Nobody Do Me

With Jesus I am an over-comer...

Marvin Sease,"Do you believe in dreams
This is a song about a young lady that was once in my life
Here's my story
Listen

I left home early
I came back very late
I saw my front door closing
As I approached the gate

I said who could it be
I know my baby is still asleep
Besides, he looks so short
And she's so tall

So I went in the house
And saw my baby laying there
And she was washed in sweat
From her head to her toes

And she said
I was dreaming
That I was making sweet love to you
And it was good
It was so good

She said dreaming
She said I never had a dream like this before
I wanna have it again

Tears filled my eyes
Because I knew the reason why
My baby wanted to have that same dream again
But what could I say, nothing
Tell me what could I do about it, nothing
Because I know I'm doing the same thing to, making love

I wonder how would she feel
If she ever finds out
That I just left the motel too

And I was dreaming
That I was making sweet love to her
And it was good
It was so good

Dreaming
Dreaming

How could she made me feel
It was good
It was so good
It was good
It was so good
So good
It was good
It was good
It was so good
Making sweet love to you

It was good
It was so good

Oh it was good y'all
It was so good

I cant give you, no, I can't
Because I only made a few ghetto plans, yes, I did,
That's the reason why, oh I'm lookin', 
I got to keep lookin', for me a ghetto woman,
I know she'll understand.
A new car I can't give you, I can't afford it, baby

And they don't include a new car, honey,
A whole lotta things, that girl should have,
I can't give,

But if it's love you're lookin for,
I want you to come on, come on, and let me love you.

I don't have much, but I'm willing to share with you,

You see baby, most men can give you a whole lot of things
But I'm just plain ole marvin, baby, 
You see I don't live in Hollywood or London or Paris or Rome,
You see, baby, I live right here in the ghetto,
I cant afford to eat the best of food,
Sometimes I eat beans out of the can,
So, if you don't mind that.

"Marvin, Welch & Farrar","Butterflies danced on invisible strings
Showing wings they borrowed from a rainbow
And a blackbird on high sang a praise to the sky
While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields with a silvery rain
Furry backed bees with a tireless drone
Never moan, they're happy to be working
And a grasshopper green could be heard but not seen
While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields with a silvery rain
Chorus:
Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul, before there's nothing left to fly at all
Take to the sky, higher than high, before the silvery rain begins to fall
Nothing moves now but the swaying ripe corn
Not a dawn is greeted with a bird's song
There's a feather or two from a bird that once flew
Before a light aeroplane sprayed the fields with a silvery rain

Seem to linger in my mind like the fragments of a dream
That was once a part of you and remains a part of me
Its the unreal world we lived in that was born of fantasy

You whiled away the hours, making promises that might
Have just changed the world we knew, if theyd only turned out right
But now Im a little wise
I can even raise a laugh
At the funny face you pulled on a faded photograph

New days replace yesterdays in time
Its well to bear in mind
That new ways erase
Nothing stays the same
And now youve even changed your name

Forever Ill remember as I pass by on the train
Streets of paradise we loved
Now so few of them remain

Guess its finally goodbye
Seems we came so suddenly
To the end of childhood dreams

Irish ways and irish laws
Villages of irish blood
waking to the morning good
But england and her soldiers came
started centuries of shame
Raped our women stole our grain
called this land a different name
Killed the leaders killed the young
put to the sword or gun or hung
history taught this to me
but what some learn is a travesty
I'm saying no slaying is playing it right
and death is the legacy of this fight
but a fight for peace agains injustice

Mary Ann Hurst,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm, I'm as jumpy as puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever, but I know it isn't spring
I am starry eyed and vaguely discontented, like a nightingale without a song to sing
O why should I have spring fever, when it isn't even spring 

I keep wishing I were someone else, walking down a strange new street
And hearing words that I've never heard from a girl I've yet to meet
I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams, spinning spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing 

I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud, or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way, that it might as well be spring
It might as well be spring.","It Might as Well Be Spring [From the Film ""State Fair""]"

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Mary Black,"There's a wilderness
It's a no man's land
Between alice springs and the ocean
Seventeen hundred miles of burning sand
And a silken thread keeps a hold on you
When the emptieness like a potion tends to fray your reason strand by strand
And there's no more need for the mask your wear
When the last goodbyes have been said
So kiss the cheeks of you dearest friends
And turn to the desert ahead
Now you're on your own like a sailing ship
You're the captain, crew and sailors
Turn around and this is what you see

Chorus

This me facing me all alone
'cause I choose to be with the wind and the sun on me only me

Now you dream so much about being lost
Your ghost by a coolebah sleeping
Haunts you and whispers in your ear
Give up give up this lonely road
No one knows the promise you're keeping
You can't touch the emptiness out here
But the grace that mends this broken wing
The blue sky to regain
Will lift those feet and raise those eyes
To face the desert again
As the dawn reveals the journey's end
In truth it's only beginning
And it's as big as your eyes wish to see

The trains come and go,

Oh, hard times, come again no more

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Many days you have lingered all around my door.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay.
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Many days you have lingered all around my door.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

There's a pale drooping maiden who foils her life away
With a worn out heart, whose better days are o'er.
Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Many days you have lingered all around my door.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

Hard times, hard times, come again no more.

Chorus
He is my hero, my dashing darling
He is my caesar, dashing darling.
I've had no rest from forebodings
Since he went far away my darling.

Every day I am constantly sad
Weeping bitterly and shedding tears
Because our lively lad has left us
And no news from him is heard alas.

The cuckoo sings not pleasantly at noon
And the sound of hounds is not heard in nut-filled woods,
Nor summer morning in misty glen
Since he went away from me, my lively boy.

Noble, proud young horseman
Warrior unsaddened, of most pleasant countenace
A swift-moving hand, quick in a fight,
Slaying the enemy and smiting the strong.

Let a strain be played on musical harps
And let many quarts be filled
With high spirit without fault or mist
For life and health to toast my lion.

Dashing darling for a while under sorrow
And all ireland under black cloaks
Rest or pleasure I did not get
Since he went far away my dashing darling.

For a while I was a gentle maiden
And now a spent worn-out widow
My spouse ploughing the waves strongly
Over the hills and far away.
",Mo Ghile Mear
Mary Black,"My love said to me
My Mother won't mind
And me Father won't slight you
For you lack of kind
Then she stepped away from me
And this she did say
It will not be long love
Till our wedding day
She stepped away from me
And she moved through the Fair
And fondly I watched her
Move here and move there
And she went her way homeward
With on star awake
As the swans in the evening
Move over the lake
The people were saying
No two e'er were wed
But one has a sorrow
That never was said
And she smiled as she passed me
With her goods and her gear
And that was the last
That I saw of my dear
I dreamed last night
That my true love came in
So softly she entered
Her feet made no din
She came close beside me
And this she did say
It will not be long love
Till our wedding day",She Moves Through the Fair
Mary Black,"Hey little brother the winds of the world
Have ruffled your soft and weakened wings
And though I can't hold you as I look into your eyes
I can see the film that disappointment brings
I know it's rained upon your childhood dreams
The games you've been playing
Weren't quite what they seemed
How can I tell you don't bang your head against the wall
The wall I've been banging and praying might fall

Your time will come on another day
And your dreams will flame and in the fire play
On another day

From the kind side of the street

Forever, forever you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you forever and ever
We never will part and I will love you
Together, together that's how it must be
To live without you could only mean heartbreak for me

And say a little prayer for you
At work I just take time, and all through my coffee break time
I say a little prayer for you

Mary Black,"And it's over now
The guns have flowed
The nightmare flashed
On a cradle road
As the guilty rain came down
No child to hold
Through anxious fears
No gentle hand
To catch the tears
That soak this ancient ground

The smile that breaks so gently
Belies a troubled head
Like a voice that holds the secrets
Of the life you might have led
Eyes with pale indifference
In danger and in grace
But the glance that knows the death-knell
Left it's shadow on your face
In the deep enduring darkness
As your loyal friends go down
Touched by the violent crown
'til their hunter's hunted down

Chorus

The web is slowly woven
The endless dreamers shed,
In the dawn the curfew is broken
On the Sunday morning's dead.
Centuries of thunder
Take the castle in the flood
To the cold night air of london
Where you hands are bound in blood.
Mid winter deepened
As the parting turned inside
A thousand times you cried
But the shadow never died.

And it's over now
The guns have flowed
The night mare flashed
On a cradle road.
As the guilty rain came down.
No child to hold
Through anxious fears
No gentle hand
No graceful years
Just bitter ancient ground.

But it's over now
",The Shadow
Mary Black,"The moon was full
And their hearts were empty
When I stopped to watch the river go down
Saw the gleaming eyes
On your blind two corners
Heard the shuffle of the buckled
As they come to lay their money down

Ooo not even with his money down
And he fades in the shadows
Of the walls of night in this town
He just fades in the shadows
Of the walls of night in this town

My heart was numb and my eyes stopped running
And the wind chilled my bones where I stopped
To watch that river go down
And the song on this street
Boasts no chest proud anthem
It's the shuffle of the buckled
As they come to lay their money down

And their hearts were empty
When I stopped to watch the river go down

I'm drowning in a river of my tears
When all my will is gone, you hold me sway
I need you at the dimming of the day

You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide
You know just where I keep my better side

What days have come to keep us far apart?
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away
I need you at the dimming of the day

Come the night, you're only what I want
Come the night, you could be my confident

I see you on the street in company
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me?

Mary Black,"Well, I woke up today and found frost perched on the town
It hovered in a frozen sky and gobbled summer down
And when the sun turned straight and cold
And shivering trees are standing in a naked row
I get the urge for going, but I never seem to go

I had someone in the summertime with summer-colored skin
And not another one in town my darling's heart could win
And when the leaves fell tumbling down
And bully winds did rub their faces in the snow
He got the urge for going, and I had to let him go

Well, he got the urge for going
When the meadow grasses are turning brown
Summertime is a-falling down
Winter's closing in

And the warriors of winter gave a cold, triumphant shout
All that stays is dying, and all that lives is getting out
You see the geese in chevron flight
A-flapping and a-racing on before the snow
They've got the urge for going and they've got the wings to go

They've got the urge for going
When the meadow grasses are turning brown
Summertime is a-falling down
Winter's closing in

I'll pile the fire with kindling and pull the blankets to my chin
I'll lock the vagrant winter out and bolt my wandering in
I'd like to call back summertime
And let her stay for just another month or so
But she's got the urge for going, and I'll have to let her go

She's got the urge for going
When the meadow grasses are turning brown

With tiny symbols here and there to make the image mine
A woman stood and painted and showed me what to find
The different parts, the fire, the air, and where my life would climb
And where it joins another, and what would always bind

It's a golden thread to hold you all of my days
Hold my head against you now and for always
Sewn me up, shown us a long, long time
Makes you my life, makes you my life

I'm weighed upon a balance here and I'm told that I can stay
The kettle heats, the water speaks up, says I'm not alone
My whole life is a tapestry and hanging in my home
And here it joins another by what will always bind

It's a golden thread to hold you all of my days
Hold my head against you now and for always
Sewn me up, shown us a long, long time
Makes you my life, makes you my life

And when you looked, your angel flew away
And what it meant was your protection's gone another day
And what has come to change you, and have you come what may
Is fashioned by an old triangle, green as April haze
Blue is just a color, but blue is here to stay

It's a golden thread to hold you all of my days
Hold my head against you now and for always

The way you care for me it's so kind

Head for the city light
Yearning inside to swim with the tide

Bag on her shoulder, breathing the cold

And wiping the table clean

Or what a broken heart means

Fallen from the icy heights
Landed with a broken cry
In this valley of shadows and sorrow and sighs

Nobody gets to give up
You can try to lock your heart away
But love will come back for you some day

Hide from the heartbreak that love always brings
Make it to the higher ground
Try to turn the volume down
Couldn't stop the sirens from singing
Sing for me baby

Crashed into my life like a runaway star
Feel myself falling like gravity's angel
Now I'm standing here offering a stranger my heart

Don't be hiding in sorrow or clinging to the past
With your beauty so precious and the seasons so fast

You've gotta rise from these ashes like a bird of flame
Take my hand
We're gonna go where we can shine

For all that we struggle for all we pretend
It don't come down to nothing except love in the end
And ours is a road that is strewn with goodbyes

It's midnight forever in my Jimmy's eyes
What should it matter if it comes on to spring

Walking around still looks the same
Same people coming and going

Shining and useless as this April sky
The hedgerows are singing and it comes on spring

Mary Black,"Walking all the day near tall towers where falcons build their nests
Silver winged they fly, they know the call of freedom in their breasts
Soar Black Head against the sky
Between the rocks that run down to the sea
Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets, asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland

Talking all the day with true friends, who try to make you stay
Telling jokes and news, singing songs to pass the night away
Watched the Galway salmon run like silver dancing darting in the sun
Living on your western shore saw summer sunsets, asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland

Drinking all the day in old pubs where fiddlers love to play
Someone touched the bow, he played a reel, it seemed so fine and gay
Stood on Dingle beach and cast, in wild foam we found Atlantic Bass
Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland

Dreaming in the night, I saw a land where no man had to fight
Waking in your dawn, I saw you crying in the morning light
Lying where the Falcons fly, they twist and turn all in you e'er blue sky
Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea and I sang a song for Ireland

Gathering together all the useful things we find

Sacrifice the world face a killing sun

Over the top and falling down the other side

Looking in on us so we have got to get it right
We've walking on their bones everywhere we go

I know your window and I know it's late 
I know your stairs and your doorway 
I walk down your street and past your gate 
I stand by the light at the four-way

You watch them as they fall 
Oh, they all have heart-attacks 
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train 
Where every night, every night is just the same?
You leave me lonely
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train 
Where every night, every night is just the same
All upon a downtown train?

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train 
Where every night, every night is just the same?
You leave me lonely 
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train 
Where all my dreams just fall like the rain
All upon a downtown train?",Downtown Train
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Last Sunday we got in the car and we drove 
To the town you were raised in, your boyhood home 
The trees were just turning, up on the ridge 
And this was your valley when you were a kid 
You showed me the railroad that your daddy worked on  
As we neared the old house where your granny lives on 
She's nearing ninety years now, with her daughters by her side 
Who tend the places in the heart where loneliness can hide

[Chorus]
Raised by the women who are stronger than you know 
A patchwork quilt of memory only women could have sewn 
The threads were stitched by family hands, protected from the moth 
By your mother and her mother--the weavers of your cloth

Your grandmother owned a gun in 1932
When times were bad just everywhere; you said she used it too 
And the life and times of everyone are traced inside their palms 
Her skin may be so weathered, but her grip is still so strong 
And I see your eyes belong to her and to your mama too 
A slice of Virginia sky, the clearest shade of blue

[Chorus]

And a rich man you might never be; they'd love you just the same 
They've handed down so much to you besides your Christian name 
And the spoken word won't heal you like the laying on of hands 
Belonging to the ones who raised you to a man

[Chorus]",Family Hands
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Heroes and heroines are scarcer than they've ever been 
So much more to lose than win 
The distance never greater 
Way back when you made history 
By flying planes across the sea 
Embarking on your odyssey 
You put away the danger

Heaven bless the one who flies 
A pioneer on frontier skies 
The world was dark and your only mark 
Was the light of the northern star 
I imagine what was in your eyes 
The seeds of rust and days gone by 
Your wings hang in a gallery sky 
I wonder how you're flying

Way out on the western plains 
The snow drifts high and the dust wind burns 
The Chinooks blow their winds across the mountains 
A life that's never safe and dry 
Rodeos and riding high 
Ladies and their men get by 
On six-guns and white lightning 

Heaven bless them on the road 
Those drifters and their dreams of gold 
The world was wide and cowboy's soul 
Could span the whole horizon 
I imagine what was in your eyes 
The dust and the dirt under outlaw skies 
A piece of land and a stubborn mind 
Were the only things worth having

Now they say the moon is dust and ash 
California's made of cash 
We're waiting for those hills to crash 
Into the sparkling waters 
Rain and snow and sun and wind 
You roamed the earth and you spread your wings 
And long ago, my heroes' dreams 
Belonged to all God's creatures

Heaven bless the ones who sleep 
The ones who laugh and the ones who weep 
Heaven bless the ones who keep 
Their bearings strong and certain 
And Lord help the fool who said 
You'd better quit while you're ahead 
A dreamer born is a hero bred 
On earth and up in heaven 
Lord help the fool who said 
You'd better quit while you're ahead 
A dreamer born is a hero bred 
On earth and up in heaven",Heroes and Heroines
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Years ago in my hometown I was a headstrong girl and a heart-strong one
We'd ride all summer with the top rolled down through the sleepy streets of that Jersey town 
Now I knew girls when I was sixteen 
Could make a smart boy stutter, turn a nice boy mean 
And the boys made the girls into homecoming queens 
Married each other instead of their dreams

[Chorus]
These days I'm mostly out on my own 
Looking for someplace that I can call home 
Late at night or just before dawn 
I pretend you're with me now 
It never seemed that hard before 
What happened to that hometown girl?

The seasons changed in my hometown 
The way they changed in yours 
The windows opened up to the spring 
Like every spring before 
And I ran with boys who weren't like you 
I was young, but somehow I knew 
The difference between a man and a fool 
Sometimes I think that could have been you

[Chorus]

Hometown girls are like hometown dreams 
Some start fading, others stay keen 
I won't forget you, but I'll let you be 
Love never was that kind to me

Late at night or just before dawn 
I pretend you're with me now 
You had your madness and you had your charm 
But only when your heart allowed 
And my heart just won't allow no more 
What happened to that hometown girl?",Hometown Girl
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Have you ever loved someone you knew nothing of 
Except you'd seen the light inside their eyes?
Have you ever loved someone just because 
Nothing felt so easy or so right?

And I think of you like the others do 
Wondering if you think of me 
And if you do, if you really do 
Who is it that you see?

Have you ever loved 
Whether right or wrong
Have you ever loved someone 
Just because?

Have you ever tried to speak the truth instead of lie 
When it seemed you had everything to lose?
Have you ever tried to stand your ground instead of hide 
When staying only made you look a fool?

And I stayed by you though I think I knew 
It wouldn't change a thing 
Changes come to hearts with ease 
But they come so hard to me 
Have you ever tried to make it last, not knowing why 
Except you had to try 
Just because?

And every day that passes now
I suppose I'm getting older 
Wiser with the things I've done 
But I hope I don't grow colder

And now I see the ones who've lost so much 
They swear they're done 
With love and all the chance it brings for pain 
But have you ever touched, and by itself it was enough 
To make you want to reach out once again?

And I'll touch you when I need a friend 
Or just a small reminder 
That I haven't grown too cold to feel 
You penetrate my armor

Have you ever loved 
Whether right or wrong 
Have you ever loved someone 
Just because?
Have you ever loved someone 
Just because?",Just Because
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"He was a long, tall stranger from way down south 
Where he'd left his life behind 
He had a big, old Gibson and a pickup truck 
And Shenandoah eyes 
And I remember him sitting in that local bar 
Where I earned my pay each night 
Singing my songs to empty chairs and going home half tight

So the nights rolled by like headlights shining on a lonesome strip of tar 
I kept his word of kindness close to me like a pick on my guitar 
And we talked about the singers and the songs we loved 
And the songs we'd most forgot 
In that run-down bar they'd make last call 
And I'd never want to stop

[Chorus]
'Cause I was living on nothing but a young girl's dreams 
With my cowboy boots and my old six-string 
Hitching my wagon to a star
Dreaming of leaving those local bars 
When I'd get him up at closing time 
For a couple of songs and a chance to shine 
Like the star that he longed to be 
He looked a hell of a lot like me

Well, he'd played a lot of places where the only wages were food and beer for free 
No fancy licks, but he had him a gift for the kinds of songs he'd sing 
But you do what you can to be a satisfied man 
Just to have your peace of mind 
So he gave it all up for a government job where the paychecks come on time

So now he comes to the bar to hear me play guitar 
And to share a drink or two 
And we sit swapping tales of where we've been and what we'd rather do 
There's a wealth of dangers when you're talking to strangers 
And I meet them all the time 
But my heart knew better than my head when I looked into those eyes

[Chorus]

Well, maybe I'll quit when I've got me a kid and a place to call my own 
But tonight there ain't nobody there waiting up for me at home 
It's a helluva way to live from day to day 
Not knowing where you're bound 
But the look in his eyes made me realize 
I was glad for the life I'd found

[Chorus]",A Lot Like Me
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"The whippoorwills were crying in the falling rain 
Far away a whistle hailed a passing train 
Out in the country summer was almost gone 
The fields were turning rusty and the hills were turning brown

Now I think of you when summer stars are on the rise 
I think of you with a bottle of wine and lazy eyes 
Playing rock-'n'-roll songs on an old guitar 
Getting drunk and sleeping out in my backyard

[Chorus]
Now sometimes I just lie awake and I hear the wind 
Blowing through the seasons of my heart again 
My dreams are mostly lost and found on other streets and other towns 
But, babe, you know, I still look out for you

The cars were all abandoned on the city streets 
When snow had left us stranded then we used our feet 
And wound up drinking whiskey in a crowded bar 
And now when it starts storming I wonder where you are

'Cause you said that I was crazy to believe in you 
You said to never trust a man who sings the blues 
Well, trust and that old guitar was all you'd ever need 
If you found a way to love the girl in me

[Chorus]

Other boys I knew were just like shiny dimes 
Tossed and spent, they came and went a hundred times 
Nothing was as rough on me as giving up on you 
Now it seems like every bar in town's got boys who sing the blues

[Chorus]",Other Streets and Other Towns
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"He pulled out in a cloud of dust
Laying rubber and spewing rust
And on any road he'd take
He'd have his foot on the pedal and my heart on the brake
Underneath the smooth tar curves
A road is only dust and dirt
On a lonely interchange
The signs all look the same
'Cause a road is just a road and a feeling's just a feeling
No matter where you go, from Waterloo to Wichita
A road is just a road that the one you love is leaving on
And midnight's another dawn, 100 miles ago
His wheels spun out of sight of me
Believing that I'd set him free
But I'd heard the voice of the prisoner
Saying he couldn't get enough of her
You go by land, you go by air
You go by sea, hell I don't care
You can go any way you choose
Wearing out the soles of your traveling shoes
And a road is just a road and a feeling's just a feeling
No matter where you go, from Bangor, Maine to Bakersfield
A road is just a road that the one you love is leaving on
And midnight's another dawn, a hundred miles ago
And every sleepless night I see him
Screaming by the scenery
Not noticing another mile
That's rolled down between him and me
'Cause a road is just a road and a feeling's just a feeling
No matter where you go, from Saskatoon to San Antone
A road is just a road that the one you love is leaving on
And midnight's another dawn, a hundred miles ago
Yes, a road is just a road and a feeling's just a feeling
No matter where you go, from San Bernardino to Sault Ste. Marie
A road is just a road that the one you love is leaving on
And midnight's another dawn, a hundred miles ago",A Road Is Just a Road
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Fetch me a glass; let's fill it with fine romance 
Pour slow the wine, then let your eyes kiss mine 
You, you with the charming eyes 
Lately I've found myself truly beguiled 
If this is a waltz, then I can't refuse 
To dance with a man like you

She must be fine; she must be enchantingly kind 
And she must be fair and never reveal that she cares 
Then, then when you've got her heart 
Spin her around till she begs you to stop 
But this is a waltz and no lady refuses 
To dance with a man like you

And if she inquires the meaning of love 
You'll silence her words with a glance 
And if she desires to wonder and pause 
You'll charmingly ask her to dance

You promised me that you would forever be kind 
And if meant to be, our love would find comfort in time 
Now, now that you feel no more 
How could I follow you out to the floor?
And now it's the waltz, but I have to refuse 
To dance with a man like you 
But this is your waltz and you'll find someone new 
To dance with a man like you",Waltz
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Fields of green by the side of the road
Going down in Mary's land
Roll down the window feel the cool of a grove
Hit the palm of your outstretched hand
Radio's playing a tune from the country
Fiddle and an old time band
Race with the moon to the edge of the water
Down in Mary's land
Down in Mary's land
East of Virginia where the bay meets a river
Down in Mary's land
The wind pulls your sleeve like a long lost lover
Whose heart can't understand
How you ever could leave
The view you behold
Ain't it fine and ain't life grand
When you don't need nothing
But some beer and a bushel
Down in Mary's land
Gonna sleep with the stars
And a slice of the moon
Hanging right above my bed
Gonna dream not of things
That I've left behind
But those I've found instead

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Every night she sleeps alone
And by her bed she puts the phone
And every morning after that
She takes the phone and puts it back

He's got a wife back home and three kids up and grown
But these are things that go unsaid
He might call her from the road just in time to say hello
And goodbye again

She keeps his picture tucked away
She thinks she'll have it framed one day
And maybe he'll come see it there
Hanging by her rocking chair

In a corner of her room on a Sunday afternoon
When all the world is dull and gray
She might close her eyes and sit, rocking gently for a bit
Till all the bad thoughts go away

Back when children played their games
London Bridge and Jesse James
She captured flags, she bounced the ball
And every time, she beat them all

And now she comes home to a cat in a three-room walk-up flat
And plays a game of solitaire
Well she made a fist last night, and she broke the hallway light
And the pieces scattered everywhere

You see, he's got a wife back home and three kids up and grown
But these are things that go unsaid
He might call her from the road just in time to say hello
And goodbye again

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Well that's a real nice jacket son
It looks like it cost you too
And that car you're driving
Hey does that belong to you
Well you don't look familiar
Are you new in town
Here's a local girl
Who wants to show you around
How do

Where'd you get that accent son
It matches your cowboy boots
Tonight those lone star ladies
Must be lonesome and oh so blue
'Cause we're a thousand miles
From the Texas line
And if you've no objection son
Tonight you're mine
How do

Well I've been to Paris baby
I've been to Dallas too
But I didn't see no one there

Just sit tight
I'm sort of in the mood
To speak some French tonight
Et vous?

",How Do
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Well I know it ain't been roses lately, baby, it's just been thorns
And no matter what we do, nothing seems to change
Love has always been my shelter, for you it's been a storm
But for a while I thought we'd almost beat the rain

Now there's a hole here in my pocket where all my dreams have gone
Fallen out like so many nickels and dimes
And last of all you, you'd always been my good luck charm
I should've known that luck's a waste of time

'Cause it don't bring you love if you don't love
And it don't bring you time if you ain't got time
And it don't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And it don't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

Now there's a whole lot of life to be unsure of
But there's one thing I can safely say I know
That of all the things that finally desert us
Pride is always the last thing to go

But it won't bring you love if you don't love
And it won't bring you time if you ain't got time
And it won't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And it won't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

And now I wish you only roses, baby, without the thorns
And I hope your dreams are always within reach
And I wish you shelter, baby, from all your storms
They scared you, but they never seemed to teach

That I can't bring you love if you don't love
And I can't bring you time if you ain't got time
And I can't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And I can't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

On a Saturday night

Sweethearts in love and others just lonely 
Searching for someone to waltz with tonight 
In a smoky old bar you know that it's only 
A slow country dance 
On a Saturday night

When the changing of partners 
Is no longer new 
You lead with your heart and closing your eyes 
Dance just to dance 
In three-quarter time

Down at the bar a woman tells stories 
Batting her eyes to someone not there 
Her glass is half full or maybe half empty 
Like the jokes told about her 
When they think she can't hear

And now the perfume is cheap and the makeup is careless 
And the dress out of fashion for a woman her age 
But she don't give a damn for those who would cherish 
A much lighter step and a much younger face

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"This shirt is old and faded
All the color's washed away
I've had it now for more damn years
Than I can count anyway
I wear it beneath my jacket
With the collar turned up high
So old I should replace it
But I'm not about to try

This shirt's got silver buttons
And a place upon the sleeve
Where I used to set my heart up
Right there anyone could see
This shirt is the one I wore to every boring high school dance
Where the boys ignored the girls
And we all pretended to like the band

This shirt was a pillow for my head
On a train through Italy
This shirt was a blanket beneath the love
We made in Argeles
This shirt was lost for three whole days
In a town near Buffalo
'Till I found the locker key
In a downtown Trailways bus depot

This shirt was the one I lent you
And when you gave it back
There was a rip inside the sleeve
Where you rolled your cigarettes
It was the place I put my heart
Now look at where you put a tear
I forgave your thoughtlessness
But not the boy who put it there

This shirt was the place your cat
Decided to give birth to five
And we stayed up all night watching
And we wept when the last one died
This shirt is just an old faded piece of cotton
Shining like the memories
Inside those silver buttons

This shirt is a grand old relic
With a grand old history
I wear it now for Sunday chores
Cleaning house and raking leaves
I wear it beneath my jacket

Find a two-step partner and a cajun beat, 
When it lifts me up, I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more
Wanna dance to a band from a Lousian' tonight
 
And I never have wandered down to New Orleans,
Never have drifted down a bayou stream
But I heard that music on the radio,
And I swore someday I was gonna go
Down a highway 10 past Lafayett
There's a Baton Rouge and I won't forget to send you a card with my regrets
'Cause I'm never gonna come back home
 
Saturday night and the moon is out 
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout,
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat, 
When it lifts me up, I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more
Wanna dance to a band from a Lousian' tonight
Hey
 
They gotta alligator stew and a crawfish pie,
A gulf storm blowin' into town tonight
Livin' on the delta it's quite a show
They got hurricane parties ev'ry time it blows?
But here up north it's a cold, cold rain,
And there ain't no cure for my blues today 
Except when the paper says Beousoleil is a comin' into town
Baby let's go down 
 
It's Saturday night and the moon is out 
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout,
Find a two-step partner and a cajun beat, 
When it lifts me up, I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more
Wanna dance to a band from a Lousian' tonight
 
Bring your mama, bring your papa, bring you sister too
They got lots of music and lots of room
When they play you a waltz form a nineteen ten, 
You're gonna fell a little bit young again
Well you learn to dance with you rockin' roll,
You learn to swing with do-si-do
But you learn to love at the fais so do?
When you hear a little Jolie Blon
 
Saturday night and the moon is out 
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout,
Find a two-step partner and a cajun beat, 
When it lifts me up, I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more
Wanna dance to a band from a Lousian' tonight 
Hey, sure",Down at the Twist and Shout
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I'm going out tonight to find myself a friend
I need a welcome smile and the grasp of an open hand
Gonna sit for hours in a small dark place, catch up with a long lost face
And talk about how long it's really been
I'm going out tonight with perfume on my wrist
I'm need to find someone to show me what I've missed
And when I see that someone sittin' there, gonna tell your memory I don't care
If he offers something more than just a kiss
Underneath the moon so bright, I wanna fall tonight
Beneath a spell
Underneath the sky so clear, I wanna find someone waiting there
Who used to know me well
I'm going out tonight without a chaperone
I'm gonna leave that meddling heart of mine at home
Cause it don't like crowds or closing time, neon blues or pickup lines
It makes me spend my Friday nights alone
Underneath the moon so bright 
Underneath the sky so clear 
I'm gonna tell myself that someone I adore
Is the one I'm with, ain't that what friends are for
Cause my empty arms are open wide; I'm long on spite, and short on pride
And the old way isn't working anymore
I'm going out tonight to find myself a friend
",Going out Tonight
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Late one night when the wind was still
Daddy brought the baby to the window sill
To see a bit of heaven shoot across the sky
The one and only time daddy saw it fly

It came from the east just as bright as a torch
The neighbors had a party on their porch
Daddy rocked the baby, mother said amen
When Halley came to visit in 1910

Now, back then Jackson was a real small town
And it's not every night a comet comes around
It was almost eighty years since its last time through
So I bet your mother would have said amen too

As its tail stretched out like a stardust streak
The papers wrote about it every day for a week
You wondered where it's going and where it's been
When Halley came to Jackson in 1910

Now daddy told the baby sleeping in his arms
To dream a little dream of a comet's charms
And he made a little wish as she slept so sound
In 1986 that wish came 'round

It came from the east just as bright as a torch
She saw it in the sky from her daddy's porch
As heavenly sent as it was back then
When Halley came to Jackson in 1910

And late one night when the wind was still",Halley Came to Jackson
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"For years she's lived on her own
In a corner of the city
Twice a year she gets back home
Playing catch-up with the family

She tells her folks what they need to know
Her mother says she's much too thin
Her sisters ask about her beau
Her dad inquires, how's business been

She's thirty-three this time around
She's always been real good at listening
Her sense of humor never lets her down
Except sometimes there's something missing

Hey, middle ground
A place between up and down
She could be safe and sound
Oh, to know middle ground

For years she's been on her guard
She's kind of tense around the shoulders
She wonders why she works so hard
She counts the days 'til they promote her

She'll take a weekend now and then
To stay in bed and watch the reruns
She'll turn the phone off when guilt sets in
But Sunday always kinda leaves her let down

Hey, middle ground; a place between up and down
She could be safe and sound; oh, to know middle ground

She gave her heart away one time, and says that she hasn't seen it since
Love's a puzzle in her mind; the pieces match, but don't quite fit; hey...
And these days run thick or thin
It never rains, or else it's pouring
All her single friends are men
She thinks married girls are so damn boring

Hey, middle ground; a place between up and down
She could be safe and sound; oh, to know middle ground
Hey, middle ground; a place between up and down
She could be safe and sound; oh, to know middle ground
Oh, to know middle ground; oh, to know middle ground
",Middle Ground
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"When I was young I spoke like a child, and I saw with a child's eyes
And an open door was to a girl like the stars are to the sky
It's funny how the world lives up to all your expectations
With adventures for the stout of heart, and the lure of the open spaces

There's 2 lanes running down this road, whichever side you're on
Accounts for where you want to go, or what you're running from
Back when darkness overtook me on a blind man's curve

I relied upon the moon, I relied upon the moon
I relied upon the moon and Saint Christopher
Now I've paid my dues cuz I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes
For being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times

Now I've paid my dues cuz I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes
For being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times
Now I have run from the arms of lovers, I've run from the eyes of friends
I have run from the hands of kindness, I've run just because I can

But now I'm grown and I speak like a woman and I see with a woman's eyes
And an open door is to me now like the saddest of goodbyes
It's too late for turning back, I pray for the heart and the nerve

And I rely upon the moon, I rely upon the moon
I rely upon the moon and Saint Christopher

I rely upon the moon, I rely upon the moon
I rely upon the moon and Saint Christopher
",The Moon and St. Christopher
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Well I think of you sometimes at night
And sometimes it's still the same
The way that it was when I was the keeper of your flame
We all have our ghosts, we all have our doubts
I'm no different with you or without
But one thing's certain: only the names have changed

And I think of you sometimes baby
When an old friend gives a call
And to hear us talk you'd think I felt nothing at all
'Cause nothing remains that used to be yours
We all have our way of closing the door
But it takes some time to get up when you fall

But I'm the same sweet girl you couldn't get enough of
Way back when you pledged your love
And you'd drive to find me through the pouring rain
Now I hear all about your running around
Man you're a legend all over town
The more things change, the more they remain the same

Sometimes I wonder if you've ever heard
The sound of a broken heart
It ain't real pretty, it ain't the thing the nice folks talk about
And the hardest thing you'll ever have to do
Is face the one who's done it to you
His eye's like an angel's, they're so devout

But I'm the same sweet girl you couldn't get enough of
Way back when you pledged your love
And you'd drive to find me through the pouring rain
Now I hear all about your running around
Man you're a legend all over town
The more things change, the more they remain the same

Right now, right now 
I'm all alone, so come on over, baby

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I can read your eyes just like a book
You tell me different, but I know that look
And I don't have to guess what's between the lines

So what in the world am I still doing here
You push me away when I get too near
Saying love's too simple to analyze

So why do I feel confused
Why do I feel so used
Like a worn-out thought you threw away
It wasn't what you said, it's what you didn't say

Where are the windows, where are the doors?
I haven't the key to your heart anymore
I haven't a clue to what's gone wrong

'Cause you look at me sometimes as if I weren't there
You say you're listening, but you never hear
The strains of silence have grown so strong

I never wanted to doubt you
But I'd be better off without you
I'm no good at looking the other way
It wasn't what you said, it's what you didn't say

So look at me one last time
With eyes that still know how to shine
Hold me like you won't let go
But you let go anyway

No one belongs where they're not wanted
You're just a ghost, and my heart is haunted
When I said goodbye, you didn't even beg me to stay
It wasn't what you said, it's what you didn't say
No baby, it wasn't what you said, it's what you didn't say
",What You Didn't Say
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"She threw her purse upon the bed
She looked around and shook her head
There's really nothing left, she said
There's nothing I ain't done
She wore your favorite dress tonight
She hoped her hair would catch the light
And you just sat there gettin' tight
On double shots of rum

You don't care what people say
They're gonna say it anyway
You don't hear what you can't use
It's always been the same old news
You don't beg and you don't plead
Or miss a thing that you don't need
She knew by the way you kissed her
When she's gone, you won't miss her

Morning comes on an old cat's paws
And when the sun hits the walls
The light's as bright as it ever was
After or before
And you wince as waking pounds your head
And you drag your arm across the bed
And the tangled sheets and the twisted spread
Fall onto the floor

And the kitchen table finds you silent
If you had a thought, now you can't find it
You take a long drag on your smoke
And taste your coffee growing cold
She didn't beg and you didn't plead
She knew exactly how to leave
The way she knew when you kissed her
When she's gone, you won't miss her

She didn't beg and you didn't plead
She knew exactly when to leave
The way she knew as you kissed her
When she's gone, you won't miss her

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Well it's a strange old game you learn it slow
One step forward and it's back you go

Sometimes you're the windshield
Sometimes you're the bug
Sometimes it all comes together baby
Sometimes you're just a fool in love
Sometimes you're the Louisville Slugger

Because you're gonna know lonely
And you're gonna know sad

And you're coming on strong
You start slippin' and slidin'

One day you're a diamond and then you're a stone

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Show a little inspiration, show a little spark
And show that things that drew me to you and stole my heart
And tell me something I don't know instead of everything I do
And look at me as if I mean something to you
Our hearts are beating while we sleep, but while we're wide awake
You know the world won't stop, and actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, and what your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard way

Show a little passion, baby, show a little style
And show the knack for knowing when and the gift for knowing how
And have a little trust in us when fear obscures the path
You know we got this far, darling, not by luck, but by never turning back
Some will call on destiny, but I just call on faith
That the world won't stop, and actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, to what your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard way

Caught up in our little lives, there's not a lot left over
I see what's missing in your eyes; you're searching for that field of clover
So show a little inspiration, show a little spark
Show the world a little light when you show it your heart
We've got two lives, one we're given and the other one we make
And the world won't stop, and actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, and your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard (everything we got, we got the hard way)
Everything we got, we got the hard way
(Because the world won't stop) hang on, baby...
",The Hard Way
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I took a walk in the rain one day 
On the wrong side of the tracks
I stood on the rail 'til I saw that train 
Just to see how my heart would react
Now some people say that you shouldn't tempt fate
And for them I can not disagree
But I never learned nothing from playing it safe
I say fate should not tempt me
 
I take my chances
I don't mind working without a net
I take my chances
I take my chances ev'ry chance I get
 
I sat alone in the dark one night
Tuning in by remote
I found a preacher who spoke of the light
But there was brimstone in his throat
He'd show me the way according to him
In return for my personal check
I flipped my channel back to CNN
And I lit another cigarette
 
I take my chances
Yes, forgiveness doesn't come with a debt
I take my chances
I take my chances ev'ry chance I get
 
I've crossed lines of words and wire
And both have cut me deep
I've been frozen out and I've been on fire
And the tears are mine to weep
But I can cry until I laugh 
Or laugh until I cry
So cut the deck right in half
I'll play from either side
 
I take my chances
I pay my dollar and I place my bet
I take my chances
I take my chances ev'ry chance I get
I take my chances
Yeah, I don't cling to remorse or regret
I take my chances
I take my chances ev'ry chance I get

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I can hear the rain come down, I can listen with my heart
I can see with both eyes closed in the dark
Sleep will come in just a while but till it does I choose
To listen to the rain, it's the rhythm of the blues

I walk along these streets of home that once belonged to us
And now baby I walk alone and I am lost
In the sound of my own footsteps on the avenues
I guess I'm only walking to rhythm of the blues

I don't wanna hear another word spoken, I don't wanna see another tear shed
I can't seem to fix what's broken, like this record baby in my head

Lonely looks as bad on me as lonely looks on you
And still we keep on moving to the rhythm of the blues

I want a place to call my own, where you have never been
I wanna look around and know you won't be coming back again
On some pretense paper-thin that I can see right through
You come and go baby, like the rhythm of the blues
You come and go baby, like the rhythm of the blues
You come and go baby, like the rhythm of the blues...

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"When you set a match to your heart, fueling it with bitterness and doubt
That's the place that once it starts, no amount of tears can put out
I know you're scared, but no one's spared when you play with matches
You got me walking through fire
You got me walking through fire

Maybe you've been burned by lovers, maybe you've been scarred by the pain
But baby, I'm not like the others, drawing moths to a flame
Spite is like a spark, crackling in the dark, consuming all it catches
And you got me walking through fire
You got me walking through fire to get to you
Got me walking through fire (walking through fire)
You got me walking through fire (walking through fire)

You can see the toll it's taking, you can feel the faith it's shaking
You can hear the heart it's breaking now

Baby, I've been burned by the fever, I've been scorched by desire
But baby, I am not your deceiver or your eloquent liar
Your jealous heart is tearing us apart, turning love to ashes

When you got me walking through fire
You've got me walking through fire to get to you
Got me walking through fire
You've got me walking through fire
You've got me walking through fire (walking through fire)
You've got me walking through fire (walking through fire)

There's nothing near as quiet as the light I'm looking for
And last time that it appeared he was lying next to me
Last time I felt this near to whispered ecstacy

And those who need adventure, they can sail the seven seas
And those who search for treasure, they must live on grander dreams

We rose and fell just like the tides, he filled my heart and soul and I
Buried all my dreams for someone else to find in my pirate days

This world is kinder to the kind that won't look back
They are the chosen few, among us now, unbowed somehow
And one day he turned to me, and before I took one breath
I knew I would only see his shadow in what light was left

And those who need adventure, they can sail the seven seas
And those who search for treasure, they must live on grander dreams

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I grew up in a house like this 
You knew the groan of every stair 
All the walls seemed to listen in 
All the years seemed to take up air 
And when you dreamed, it was of the wind blowing cold and hard 
And in those dreams you thought you lived in a house of cards 

And I grew up in a town like this 
You knew the names of every street 
On the surface it looked so safe 
But it was perilous underneath 
That's the place where you shoved your doubts
And hid your ugly scars
God forbid if word got out
About your house of cards 

And now I feel the wind about to blow 
Baby, I'm so scared 
We're repeating the past instead of letting it go 
And I don't want to go back there 

Now we're standing here face to face 
Afraid to move or else 
I want to prop up this fragile place 
But I can't do it all by myself 
'Cause when we dream, it's of the wind blowing cold and hard 
And when we wake up, we still live in a house of cards

Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I was standing on this sidewalk
In 1945 in Jacksonville, Illinois 
When asked what my name was there came no reply 
They said I was a deaf and sightless, half-wit boy 

But Lewis was my name though I could not say it 
I was born and raised in New Orleans 
My spirit was wild, so I let the river take it 
On a barge and a prayer upstream

They searched for a mother and they searched for a father 
And they searched till they searched no more 
The doctors put to rest their scientific test 
And they named me John Doe No. 24 

And they all shook their heads in pity 
For a world so silent and dark 
Well, there's no doubt that life's a mystery 
But so too is the human heart

And it was my heart's own perfume
When the crape jasmine bloomed on St. Charles Avenue 
Though I couldn't hear the bells of the streetcars coming 
By toeing the track I knew 

And if I were an old man returning 
With my satchel and pork-pie hat 
I'd hit every jazz joint on Bourbon 
And I'd hit every one on Basin after that

The years kept passing as they passed me around 
From one state ward to another 
Like I was an orphaned shoe from the lost and found 
Always missing the other

They gave me a harp last Christmas 
And all the nurses took a dance 
Lately I've been growing listless 
Been dreaming again of the past

I'm wandering down to the banks of the Great Big Muddy 
Where the shotgun houses stand 
I am seven years old and I feel my daddy 
Reach out for my hand
 
While I drew breath no one missed me 
So they won't on the day that I cease 
Put a sprig of crape jasmine with me 
To remind me of New Orleans

In 1945 in Jacksonville, Illinois",John Doe No. 24
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I can tell by the way you're walking
You don't want company 
I'll let you alone and I'll let you walk on 
And in your own good time you'll be 

Back where the sun can find you
Under the wise wishing tree 
And with all of them made we'll lie under the shade
And call it a jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're talking
That the past isn't letting you go 
But there's only so long you can take it all on
And then the wrong's gotta be on its own

And when you're ready to leave it behind you
You'll look back and all that you'll see 
Is the wreckage and rust that you left in the dust
On your way to the jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're listening
That you're still expecting to hear 
Your name being called like a summons to all
Who have failed to account for their doubts and their fears

They can't add up to to much without you
And so if it were up to me, I'd take hold of your hand 
Saying come hear the band
Play your song at the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're searching
For something you can't even name  
That you haven't been able to come to the table
Simply glad that you came

When you feel like this try to imagine
That we're all like frail boats on the sea 
Just scanning the night for that great guiding light
Announcing the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're standing
With your eyes filling with tears 
That it's habit alone that keeps you turning for home
Even though your home is right here

Where the people who love you are gathered
Under the wise wishing tree 
May we all be considered then straight on delivered
Down to the jubilee 

Because to people who love you are waiting
And they'll wait just as long as need be 
When we look back and say those were halcyon days 
We're talking about jubilee",Jubilee
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"She says it's been so long, she can't remember when
The mention of his name didn't make her feel again
That everything is possible and every day a brand new start
Yeah, love's something powerful when it finds a willing heart
Sometimes it's a fire burning out of control
Sometimes it's a candle burning long and low
All these years she never let it go
There's a keeper for every flame
There is someone in his past that he hasn't gotten over yet
Each day's like the last, he just misses what he can't forget
It's just an empty space where something used to be
Now he guards the gate, but he's lost the key
So no one enters, but no one leaves
There's a keeper for every flame
Thought my heart had broken, but it was just a little bruised
I thought love had spoken, I guess I was just confused
Sometimes we were a fire burning out of control
Sometimes we were nothing but a candle glow
But it never died, baby, how I know
There's a keeper for every flame
",A Keeper for Every Flame
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"[Chorus]
You can have it; I don't want it
And when you've got, it I'll be gone 
It won't matter what you're saying
When the damage has all been done 

Can't seem to keep the faith 
As if that's all I need to do 
I'd rather walk away 
Than take what belongs to you

[Chorus]

Some words will cut you down 
Like you were only in the way 
Why should I stand this ground? 
It won't hurt as much to say

[Chorus]

Sometimes we're blinded by 
The very thing we need to see 
I finally realized 
You need it more than you need me

[Chorus]

The damage has all been done",The Last Word
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Everywhere I see the signs pointing one direction 
No more twists or crooked turns leaving room for doubt 
Where I used to take the time for quiet and reflection 
Now I only hear the noise of what I am without

I see them walking hand in hand and my eyes just want to linger 
On those golden wedding bands wrapped around their fingers 
By the time I turn away I feel it once again 
I'm back in this familiar place, outside looking in

Baby, all the tears between us couldn't fill the spaces 
And all the words we grasped at they just fell away 
I kept waiting on forgiveness to fix the broken places 
But nothing even like it ever came my way
 
And tonight I drove around and the street came up before me 
I took a turn and then I found this old house coming toward me 
I heard the sound a heart must make when a memory's caving in 
Oh, baby, what a hungry place, outside looking in

It's the hardest kind of need that never knows a reason 
Are we such a lonely breed or just born in a lonely season?
Baby, it's all in the eyes; it's where the reckoning begins 
It's where we linger like a sigh; it's where we long to be pulled in
It's where we learn to say goodbye without saying anything 
Just standing on the borderlines, outside looking in",Outside Looking In
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"Don't mean to get a little forward with you
Don't mean to get ahead of where we are
Don't mean to act a little nervous around you
I'm just a little nervous about my heart 'cause

It's been awhile since I felt this feeling
That everything that you do gives me
It's been so long since somebody whispered
Shut up and kiss me

Didn't expect to be in this position
Didn't expect to have to rise above
My reputation for cynicism
I've been a jaded lady when it comes to love, but

Oh, baby, just to feel this feeling
That everything that you do gives me
It's been too long since somebody whispered
Shut up and kiss me

There's something about the silent type attracting me to you
All business, baby, none of the hype
That no talker can live up to

Come closer, baby, I can't hear you
Just another whisper, if you please
Don't worry 'bout the details, darlin'
You've got the kind of mind I love to read

Talk is cheap and, baby, time's expensive
So why waste another minute more?
Life's too short to be so apprehensive
Love's as much the symptom, darlin', as the cure

Oh, baby, when I feel this feeling
It's like genuine voodoo hits me
It's been too long since somebody whispered

Oh, baby, I can feel this feeling
That everything that you do gives me
It's been too long since somebody whispered
Shut up and kiss me
Shut up and kiss me",Shut Up and Kiss Me
Mary Chapin Carpenter,"When we were young we pledged allegiance
Every morning of our lives
The classroom rang with children's voices
Under teacher's watchful eye
We learned about the world around us
At our desks and at dinner time
Reminded of the starving children
We cleaned our plates with guilty minds

And the stones in the road
Shone like diamonds in the dust
And then a voice called to us
To make our way back home

When I was ten my father held me
On his shoulders above the crowd
To see a train draped in mourning
Pass slowly through our town
His widow kneeled with all their children
At the sacred burial ground
And the TV glowed that long hot summer 
With all the cities burning down

And the stones in the road
Flew out beneath our bicycle tires
Worlds removed from all those fires
As we raced each other home

And now we drink our coffee on the run
We climb that ladder rung by rung
We are the daughters and the sons
And here's the line that's missing
The starving children have been replaced 
By souls out on the street
We give a dollar when we pass
And hope our eyes don't meet
We pencil in we cancel out
We crave the corner suite
We kiss your ass, we make you hold 
We doctor the receipt

And the stones in the road
They fly out from beneath our wheels
Another day, another deal
Before we get back home

Stones in the road
Leave a mark whence they came
A thousands points of light or shame
Baby, I don't know",Stones in the Road
