The Byrds,"Keep sayin' no to her since she was a baby
Keep sayin' no to her, not even maybe.
Why? Why?

You say there's a limit there, she can't go past that
She doesn't believe you, she don't think that's where it's at.
Why? Why?

Say she can't change that, it's the way you've always done it
She don't care abut that, she thinks you've just begun it.
Why? Why?

You say it's a dead old world, cold and not living
I don't know where you live but you're not living.
Why? Why?

Keep sayin' no to her since she was a baby
Keep sayin' no to her, not even maybe.
Why? Why?",Why?
The Byrds,"Pushed me off the street today
The light in my eyes gets in the way
Of the darkness you pushed me in
You say that it's a sin we're hanging around

You told me not to sing today
You say my music gets in the way
Cause it walks on in just as you begin
Binging my soul brothers down

And although you're smiling
Your hate will not cease
So just face yourself babe
And leave me in peace

Well I'll stay out of your way
If you stay out of mine
If I could let the evil go
Oh, you know we'll both go down in fire",Bad Night at the Whiskey
The Byrds,"Change is now, change is now
Things that seemed to be solid are not
All is now, all is now
The time that we have to live

Gather all that we can
Keep in harmony with love's sweet plan

Truth is real, truth is real
That which is not real does not exist
In and out roundabout
Dance to the day when fear it is gone

Gather all that we can
Keep in harmony with love's sweet plan

Change is now, change is now
Things that seemed to be solid are not
In and out roundabout
Dance to the day when fear it is gone
Fear it is gone

The Byrds,"If you're looking to get a good thing going for yourself
House and pool, a new Rolls Royce and some degree of wealth
Don't make waves, don't make waves, don't make waves

Take a ride out West to find that freedom that you crave
Kick that nine to five, don't let them make you a slave
Don't make waves, don't make waves, don't makes waves

And when the toys that you dreamed of have finally come
They all will break and you're back where you started from

Now that blue is calling you with days and nights so warm
You can find excitement any size, shape or form
Don't make waves, don't make waves, don't make waves

Don't make waves, don't make waves, don't make waves
Don't make waves, don't make waves, don't make waves
Don't make waves, don't make waves, don't make waves",Don't Make Waves
The Byrds,"He's a drug store truck drivin' man
He's the head of the Ku Klux Klan
When summer rolls around
He'll be lucky if he's not in town

Well, he's got him a house on the hill
He plays country records till you've had your fill
He's a fireman's friend he's an all night DJ
But he sure does think different from the records he plays

He's a drug store truck drivin' man
He's the head of the Ku Klux Klan
When summer rolls around
He'll be lucky if he's not in town

Well, he don't like the young folks I know
He told me one night on his radio show
He's got him a medal he won in the War
It weighs five-hundred pounds and it sleeps on his floor

He's a drug store truck drivin' man
He's the head of the Ku Klux Klan
When summer rolls around
He'll be lucky if he's not in town

He's been like a father to me
He's the only DJ you can hear after three
I'm an all night musician in a rock and roll band
And why he don't like me I can't understand

He's a drug store truck drivin' man
He's the head of the Ku Klux Klan

The Byrds,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,

The Byrds,"Have you seen her face her eyes reflect the colors in the sky
A warm familiar place to be swept into
Whenever she's close by makes me wonder why

Run by don't turn back
Can't hide from that look in her eye

Must be the way she walks a style made up to capture all she needs
No time to spend on loose talk
If your luck runs right she might see you tonight anything in sight

Run by don't turn back
Can't hide from that look in her eyes

Run by don't turn back
Can't hide from that look in her eyes

You'll find your locked in her spell all the sights and sounds
Your senses will be found
That only time will tell how much love can be to wait so patiently
Wait and see

Run by don't turn back
Can't hide from that look in her eyes",Have You Seen Her Face
The Byrds,"Here it comes again, it's going to happen to me
Here it comes, I should have learned to duck
She's going to say, she's going away
And I will have to live without her and survive

Here it comes, it looks just like the last wave I drowned in
Here it comes and I'm so far from shore
She's going to go and take her trinkets
And I will have to live without her and survive

Here it comes again, the night is going to fall
Here it comes, she's going to say goodbye
She's going to go and leave only me
And I will have to live without her and survive",Lady Friend

Well I had an old dog and his name was Blue
Yes, I had an old dog and his name was Blue

The Byrds,"Old John Robertson
He wore a Stetson hat
People everywhere would
Laugh behind his back

No one cared to take
Any time to find out
What he was all about
Fear kept them out

Children laughed and played
And didn't know his name
They could tell when he
Was coming just the same

Walking slow with old John's
Crippled wife by his side
Then she sighed, then she died

Magic words from him
Entrancing children's ears
But they laughed at him
When he went to hide his tears

All in vain was no game
For he'd lost an old friend
In the end, in the end

The Byrds,"I think that maybe I'm dreaming

I smell cinnamon and spices
I hear music everywhere
All around kaleidoscope of color
I think that maybe I'm dreaming

Maids pass gracefully in laughter
Wine colored flowers in their hair
Last call from lands I've never been to
I think that maybe I'm dreaming

Sun's flash on a soda prism
Bright jewels on the ladies flashing
Eyes catch on a shiny prism

Hear ye the crying of the vendors
Fruit for sale wax candles for to burn
Fires flare soon it will be night fall

The Byrds,"You make me smile
And all the while
You're so cool I can feel
You care if it's real

Our love

I found you here
The sun in your hair
Caught my eye passing by
I knew I should try

Our love

I watched the planes coming in
Felt my heartbeat begin
And I knew that I would stay

A whole city new
But this time we'll share

The Byrds,"Spoke to my girl on the phone today
She said she wish I'd come there right away
In Boston Massachusetts where she lives
Got to get there for the love she gives

Catch a plane and soon I will be gone
And I'll be in her arms before too long
In Boston Massachusetts she'll be there
And we'll be together everywhere

You see, I'm leaving 'cause I'm sad
Got a girl and I want to see her bad
You see I'm not leaving 'cause of you

The Byrds,"The moon can light the sky at night for me again
The sun can make the daytime bright and fun again
And my heart can be free the way it wants to be

The wind blows pain and clouds of rain away again
And lets me stay with just a happy day again
'Cause now I really see how much you do love me
How good the world can be again

Oh, when you left that day I forgot how to care
And I hid myself away but now since you are here

The Byrds,"Daytime just makes me be lonely
At night I can only dream about you
Girl you're on my mind
Nearly all of the time
It's so hard bein' here without you

Words in my head keep repeating
Things that you said when I was with you
And I wonder is it true
Do you feel the same way too
It's so hard bein' here without you,
Bein' here without you

Though I know it won't last I'll see you someday
It seems as though that day will come never
But there's one thing I'll swear
Though you're far away
I'll be thinking about you forever

Still with all the friends I know

When you were standing there sad in your way
Was that you were not blind
You were sure to make a fool of me
'Cause there was nothing there was that you could see
That could go beyond your mind
Now who's standing at the door
Remembering the days before
And asking please be kind
It isn't how it was set up to be
But I set you free this time
I have never been so far out in front
That I could never ask for what I want
And have it anytime

Knowing this you found the thought for me
That told you just what I should be
And there I stood behind
With all the ones that were before
And memories that always seem to tear me from my mind
In front of what it is you see me to be
And I've set you free this time

I could never find a chance to choose
Between a way to to wear or a thing to loose
Because there was your stand
On top of all the love you took
That was always something you could look at

And why it cannot be arranged to have each thing work fine

Then listen now to what I say
Just get an electric guitar
Then take some time

And learn how to play
And with your hair swung right
And your pants too tight

Then it's time to go downtown
Where the agent man won't let you down
Sell your soul to the company
Who are waiting there to sell plastic ware

And in a week or two
If you make the charts
The girls'll tear you apart
The price you paid for your riches and fame

Was it all a strange game?
You're a little insane
The money, the fame, and the public acclaim
Don't forget who you are

An' midnights broken toll
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing
As majestic bells of bolts
Struck shadows in the sound
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
An' for each an' every underdog soldier in the night
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Even though a cloud's white curtain
In a far-off corner flashed
An' the hypnotic splattered mist Was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing",Chimes of Freedom

You think will last
But if there's something you wish to keep
Better grab it fast

Yonder stands your orphan with his gun

And it's all over now, baby blue

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
The sky too is foldin' under you
And it's all over now, baby blue

All your seasick sailors, they are goin' home
Your empty-handed armies, they are goin' home

Has taken all his blankets from the floor

And clung to a new love's breast

Rollin' high and mighty traps
Countless with fire on flaming roads

Never with a herd
Prettiest mare I've ever seen
You'll have to take my word

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand

Well I was up on Stony Ridge
After this chestnut mare, been chasing her for weeks
Oh I'd catch a glimpse of her every once in a while
Taking her meal, bathing, fine lady
This one day I happen to be real close to her
And I saw her standing over there
So I snuck up on her nice and easy
Got my rope out
And I flung it in the air!

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand
And we'll be friends for life
She'll be just like a wife
I'm going to catch that horse if I can

And I got her and I'm pulling on her
And she's pulling back like this mule going up a ladder
And I take a choice and I jump right up on her
Damned if I don't land right on top of her
And she takes off, running up onto the ridge
Higher than I've ever been before
She's running along just fine
'Til she stops and something spooked her
It's a sidewinder, all coiled and ready to strike
She doesn't know what to do for a second
But then, she jumps off the edge, me holding on

Above the hills, higher than eagles were gliding
Suspended in the sky
Over the hill
Straight for the sun we were riding
My eyes were filled with light
Behind those black walls
Below was a bottomless canyon
Floating with no sound
Ghosts far below
Seemed to be suddenly rising
Exploding all around

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand
And we'll be friends for life
She'll be just like a wife
I'm going to catch that horse if I can

We were falling
Down this crevice
About about a mile down it seem
And I looked down
And I see this red thing below us coming up real fast
And it's our reflection that's
This little pool of water about six feet wide and one foot deep
And we're falling down right through it
We hit, we splashed it dry
That's when I lost my hold
And she got away
But I'm gonna try and get her again some day

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand
And we'll be friends for life

His wife beside him in a wagon as into town they rode

And along come a deputy sheriff in a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language and his wife she overheard

And pretty boy Floyd grabbed a long chain, and the deputy grabbed a gun
And in the fight that followed, he laid that deputy down

Then he ran through the trees and bushes and lived a life of shame
Every crime in Oklahoma was added to his name

He ran through trees and bushes on the Canadian River shore
And many a starving farmer opened up his door

It was in Oklahoma City, it was on a Christmas Day
A whole carload of groceries and a letter that did say

You say that I'm an outlaw, you say that I'm a thief
Well, here's a Christmas dinner for the families on relief

But every day can be a magic carpet ride

Was in the town of Shawnee on a Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in a wagon as into town they rode

And along come a deputy sheriff in a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language and his wife she overheard
And pretty boy Floyd grabbed a long chain, and the deputy grabbed a gun
And in the fight that followed, he laid that deputy down

Then he ran through the trees and bushes and lived a life of shame
Every crime in Oklahoma was added to his name
He ran through trees and bushes on the Canadian River shore
And many a starving farmer opened up his door

It was in Oklahoma City, it was on a Christmas day
A whole carload of groceries and a letter that did say
You say that I'm an outlaw, you say that I'm a thief
Well, here's a Christmas dinner for the families on relief

Green and blossomin' round against the sea
And there the sun came and the rain pourin' down
Garden grew and flourished and splattered bits of color on the ground
And it took shape and symmetry and all of life around
But there came winds driven and howling
There came snow and I feared for the garden
So I built a wall and I built another and roofed it over thick and strong
And kept it from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
The killing cold could not get in
But when the sun came and the gentle rain of spring
They could not reach the garden behind those walls
It would have died, safely, securely, died
But as I longed and as I learned I tore the walls all down

She's loaded deep as deep can be,
But not so deep as the love I'm in,
And I know not how, I sink or swim.

I leaned my back up against some young oak,
Thinking he was a trusty tree,
But first he bended and then he broke,
And thus did my false love to me.

I put my hand into some soft bush,
Thinking the sweetest flower to find.
I pricked my finger to the bone,
And left the sweetest flower alone.

Oh, love is handsome, love is fine,
Gay as a jewel, when first it is new,
But love grows old, and waxes cold,
And fades away, like summer dew.

Below was a bottomless canyon
Floating with no sound
Ghosts far below 
Seemed to be suddenly rising
Exploding all around

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand
And we'll be friends for life
She'll be just like a wife
I'm going to catch that horse if I can

We were falling 
Down this crevice 
About about a mile down it seem
And I looked down 
And I see this red thing below us coming up real fast
And it's our reflection that's 
This little pool of water about six feet wide and one foot deep
And we're falling down right through it
We hit, we splashed it dry
That's when I lost my hold 
And she got away
But I'm gonna try and get her again some day

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand
And we'll be friends for life
She'll be just like a wife
I'm going to catch that horse, I'm going to catch that horse, I'm going to catch that horse, if I can",Chestnut Mare [Album Version]
The Byrds,"Eight miles high and when you touch down
You'll find that it's stranger than known
Signs in the street that say where you're going
Are somewhere just being their own

Nowhere is there to be found
Among those afraid of losing their ground
Mean grey town known for its sound
In places small, places unbound

Now the squares of moving storms
Some laughing, some just shapeless forms
Sidewalk scenes and black limousines
Some living, some standing alone",Eight Miles High [Album Version]
The Bystanders,"The child breaks each moment of sadness for our sakes 
Leaving, trying his best to believe then 
Hoping this dream will come true 
Sadness is only a face for you 

I will try like the devil to bear your names 
Anything for you 
In only a moment your life can change 

Still lake, rocking the boat it's not too late 
Leaving, trying your best to believe then 
Hoping this dream will come true 
Sadness is only a face for you 

I will try like the devil to bear your names 
Anything for you 
In only a moment your life can change 

You fell through the window and down on the floor 
You found a direction, you hope will say more 
With your life, it's taken every one in view 

The people are pretty 
The flowers are, too 
You don't get to heaven 
If they don't say you do 

Cause it's life and it's taken every one of you 
And it's true 
I'd like to take you but I don't think there's room for two

The C.O.R.E.,"Two months prior you said you had a dire emergency
It was 1:30, my face was all dirty trying to get some sleep
Head still whirling, throw on my shearing leave my man home
Two dots yes I'm coming, yes my car is running, hang up my cell phone

By the time I arrived you was deep about five like you had beef
And then you tried to step and told me that I slept like you was cock deez
It was all about some niggaz that you thought was jigga
Who was digging me and I told you after that day we ain't cool baby, so

Whatcha think this a game ain't no bo dy playing
Thought I told you before, don't knock on my door
I was trying to be nice for your own advice
Ooh girl you don' did it now, really, really, really did it now watch out

I was kinda thrown head was kinda blown but I'm not blue
Lost a couple friends once or twice before, I'm still cool
Then you tried to flex like you were the next bitch who you trying to fool
You just another girl from the avenue who graduated school

Now you wanna be down after you tried to clown me baby doll
But ain't no future in fronting and frontiers
Don't hang around with me at all
And now I make my music got me some new dick and I'm doing fine
And I'm still real ghetto and I still kick your black behind

Whatcha think this a game ain't nobody playing
Thought I told you before, don't knock on my door

I was trying to be nice for your own advice
Ooh girl you don' did it now, really, really, really did it now watch out

Yo, I'm ringing the phone two in the a.m. rudely awaken
Dreaming deep concentration hazy
She really couldn't peep what they was saying
At first all I know was Jag really wasn't playing at all

She left calming to speak to the John
Got the Jaguar double parked, blinkers is on
Head pulled back sneakers is on
Yo I don't know what sis told her
But she bout' to get a beatin' performed

She grabbing all up on her shirt tugging on her slacks
Jag tried to go in the grill I had to hold her back
Cool her out try to tell her to chill, lower the thermostat
You a star no need for you to stoop as low as that boy

Scrapping over men is best avoided
And a real lady would never confess to doing it
She said I'm ganstar don't let the dress confuse you
The only things sweet is the music, it's really not a game

Whatcha think this a game ain't no bo dy playing
Thought I told you before, don't knock on my door

It's only a line if it gets bought

Putting up walls around what was once innocent
It won't let me in but I'm stronger than that
Cause you stole my eyes and I'll never look back

Girl last night I forgot to mention
The way that I feel the way that I'll remember this
When we're this young we have nothing to lose
We just the clock to beat and a hand to choose

It's a long drive back to Vegas skies
So I don't, I make one more wrong turn tonight so

And you said I'd never get things right
(I never said it was the best thing for you)

And baby where'd you go
I need you here tonight

Singing myself to sleep
And you're still my favorite melody
It's been three weeks
How long can this go on
Singing myself to sleep
And you're haunting every memory
Goodbye, get out, of my life
Goodnight

And you're hot cold
You're bad around the bones
You run while I lose control
I miss you forever you'll stay gold
And girl you know I'm not getting by
I've lost it you're in my mind
And everyday's the darkest day of my life

And you're haunting every memory
Goodbye, get out, of my life

Cause I'm drowning when I close my eyes
And I'm falling can't breathe tonight
And our story has fade to black inside (inside)

Cause I'm drowning when I close my eyes
And I'm falling can't breathe tonight
And our story has fade to black inside (inside)

The Cab,"Baby girl I'm not quite human
And I'm not quite a machine

At something that's somewhere in between

I can shake you, but then I'll break you
And baby sweat is guaranteed

I wish I could give you my love and my soul
But inside my chest there is nobody home

My heart may be missing
But my hands will make up for it

I'll sink my teeth right into it

You'll be coming home with me

Girl you locked the door behind you
When you walked into my room
And your eyes have got me thinking
That maybe there's a different side of you
'Cause when I'm attacking, your nails are scratching
So I wonder could it be
That when your clothes fall to your feet
You could be an animal like me

I wish I could give you my love and my soul
But inside my chest there is nobody home

My heart may be missing
But my hands will make up for it

Warms me up like a summer night

Let me save a life

And let me lose my voice
Singing all my favorite songs
Let me stare up at the stars

My heart like a firework in my chest
My only regret is having regrets
Traveled the world
I loved every step

And all I know is:
No one, no one lives forever
We will be remembered
For what we do right now

And baby I'm living louder
And dreaming longer, tonight

And baby I'm fighting harder
And loving stronger tonight

But the great will always last
We're growing older
But we're all soldiers tonight

Gonna drink with all my friends
Gonna laugh until we cry
As we talk and reminisce

And let me kiss a stranger
And rob the local bank
Let me become real rich
So I can give it all away

'Cause no one, no one lives forever

Ten years ago on this day,
My heart was yearning.
I promised I would never ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart
And left me yearning

As we walked into the room,
There were faces
Staring, glaring, tearing through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes
That looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me

Still concealing gloom
There were two girls sitting in my room
She walked up to my face

Every smile's a trial thought in beguile
To hurt me
Then the man next door had told
He's been here in tears for fifteen years

And found that wicked women run this strange hotel

In the darkness when you find this
I'll be out of reach

When you missed every shot

My faults shine in the sun
A train bridge of spies
Watches all the cars collide

I roll my green sleeves over Ruby
I don't blame you for doing it to me
Real girls don't take aim
Like kings do these days

I made my mind up to be a black winged bird
Never turn my head for how things were
Leave the bluest skies for boys to burn
And I'll soar on my way
Sad as the state of things we can't change

Now we're paper dolls all aflame
In houses that all look the same
Rows of regret
An arson for a wilderness

I hide my saints in the willow trunk
You started me on this junk
Now my black lungs are blue
But I'm still singing to you

To always be silenced every time she spills tears

If it's strong enough to hold me
Then I'm weak enough to live
But I can't ever leave you, baby I believe
Just want to be the one who shakes down the last leaf

Long time running from the strong lines that holds
It's all I've known, don't adjust your set
There are cracks on the pavement
So watch where you walk
I'm up in my room, can you be here soon?

You've put it across forbidden lines
If you never brought it back
I'd never know how where to find it

Long time running from the strong lines that holds
It's all I've known, don't adjust your set

Throwing shapes and power ploys
In your arms a warmth I did find
In your seed I did recline

Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it

One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches

People still takin' rappin' for a joke
A passing hope or a phase with a rope
Sometimes I choke and try to believe
When I get challenged by a million MCs
I try to tell them, ""We're all in this together!""
My album was raw because no-one would ever
Think like I think and do what I do
I stole the show, and then I leave without a clue

What do you think makes up a KRS?
Concisive teaching, or very clear speaking?
Ridiculous bass, aggravating treble
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid
Not by financial aid, but a raid of hits
Causing me to take long trips
I'm the original teacher of this type of style
Rockin' off-beat with a smile
Or smirk or chuckle, yes some are not up to
BDP Posse so I love to
Step in the jam and slam
I'm not Superman, because anybody can
Or should be able to rock off turntables
Grab the mic, plug it in and begin
But here's where the problem starts, no heart
Because of that a lot of groups fell apart
Rap is still an art, and no-one's from the Old School
'cause Rap is still a brand-new tool
I say no-one's from the Old School 'cause Rap on a whole
Isn't even twenty years old
Fifty years down the line, you can start this
'cause we'll be the Old School artists
And even in that time, I'll say a rhyme
A brand-new style, ruthless and wild
Runnin' around spendin' money, havin' fun
'cause even then, I'm still number one.

[Verse 2]
Blastmaster KRS-One of course
Comes to express with style the lost
Ways of rhyming, old and new, past and present
Knock, knock, who is it?
A brand-new style, hup, time to change
People talk about me when they see me on stage
Live in action, guaranteed raw
I hang with the rich and I work for the poor
Now tomorrow you can say you saw
KRS-One stompin' once more
I play by ear, I love to steer
The Alfa Romeo from here to there
I grab the beer, but not in the ride
'cause I'm not stupid, I don't drink and drive
I'm not a beginner, amateur or local
My album is sellin' because of my vocals
You know what you need to learn?
Old School artists don't always burn
You're just another rapper who's had his turn
Now it's my turn, and I am concerned
About idiots posing as kings
What are we here to rule?
I thought we were supposed to sing
And if we oughta sing, then let us begin to teach
Many of you are educated, open your mouth and speak
KRS-One is something like a total renegade
Except I don't steal, I rhyme to get paid
Airplanes flyin', overseas people dyin'
Politicians lyin', I'm tryin'
Not to escape, but hit the problem head-on
By bringin' out the truth in a song
So BDP, short for Boogie Down Productions
Made a little noise 'cause the crew was sayin' somethin'
People have the nerve to take me for a gangster
An ignorant one, something closer to a prankster
Doin' petty crimes, goin' straight to penitentiary
But in a scale of crime that's really elementary
This beat is now compelling me to explain in silence
Why my last jam was so violent
It's simple: BDP will teach reality
No beatin' around the bush, straight up, just like The P Is Free
So now you know, a poet's job is never done
But I'm never overworked, 'cause I'm still number one.

On they bike, yelling, ""What that Eastside like?""
Getting high in the bleachers while the teachers on strike
Books collect dust on they shelf
Parents either dead or gone, so they raise theyself
But who cares

Some talk about killing, some hear about it, some do it
Some can't handle it, and others just numb to it
You think we got problems? They the ones
Cause kids is having kids, and kids is having guns
Ask yours daughters and sons what they learning in school
And watch em look at you like you a fool
All they learn is how to smoke a bidi
How to do a tattoo use a rubber, cuss, fight, and write graffiti
The TV and the radio is raisin em
Parents hold your breath, cause death ain't even fazing em
A single mother out working like a slave
Ain't no home cooked meal, just a microwave
Oven, what happened to the loving?
Good taste done been replaced by pushing, and shoving
It all started at home with the family
Now we can't save em, or can we?
Who cares

Makes me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands

They don't give a fuck
So I don't give a fuck

Don't nobody care what happen to us
Except God Almighty, in whom we trust
I bust rhymes like these for a reason
Cause for everything up under the sun it's a season
To live and die, laugh and cry
Everybody knows shit happens, but nobody knows why
And they don't even try to learn
By letting the 5 Percent teach em, it's like they rather burn
And for niggas just to turn they life around and chill
It's harder to save, than it is to kill
As we spill each other blood in the streets
I see yellow tape and wonder who that is up under the sheet
Another child just got shot down
Now what's the chances that they not black and not brown?
A lotta people crowd around cause they feel they got to stop and stare
But they don't really care

Makes me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands

They don't give a fuck
So I don't give a fuck",Whoop Whoop
The Cali Kings,"[Chorus]
I work the angles sharp and precise
Dilated Peoples so you better build twice
Act like ya know, not now but right now
Dilated Peoples

The name is Iriscience

I go through rivers (what?) so I don't leave a scent
I travel both directions but leave one set of prints
It's just a little trick, of the indigenous
Developing inner visions of what religion is
I caught the understanding and the underhanded
I plan to build my ship and man it to another planet
Under heavy surveillance, many different agents
Some are camouflage, others are very blatant
I study weapon systems and vocal fighting forms
I'm many moves ahead, the thoughts are highly formed
Like time times time times time is time squared
Went there, sayin' ""Rakaa you don't rhyme fair""
But I never dummy lyrics and they kick it to my people
It's about communication not a rappers ego
Messages I sneak in they seem to seep in
Mixed with alcohol and weed on the weekend
Shared among friends like various sins
One day it clicks it's no longer dim
Time release capsules humble the headstrong
Your thoughts of takin' me head on are dead wrong

[Chorus]

It's the master of Aikido
I let go, karate confrontations 
Evidence scientist in innovation
I locks on when I travels around planets
Smooth but got a rough edge like Wulitzer pianists
Display mucho attack, receive payments for the cadence
A in this, you get fit fowl with flagrance
Free agents on the dotted line more hard to sign
Not easily impressed with gold mines and whole nines
I'm somewhere in-between never rushed and in a hurry
And when I swing my bat I don't think I'll miss like baseball
Fury the jury's hung, from verdict and got no chance
Dilated comes first the rest are second like Stu Lance

Oh yes it get better everyday 
The A-1, is my mind on vintage display?
Unattended in this case 
(The Ace two steps ahead)
Everyday is Mayday and best friends are Feds
But I know this that's why they closest
In a crisis situation you negotiate first 
I'm perfectly focused
Strategic and in a zone 
It was radar detected but my speed was unknown
Anonymity, that's my key to survival
Ev is not for Evidence it's for all the dense on trial
Just remember in this game it take two to tango
Don't go to them let them come to you 
And work the angles

It takes all the strength I have in me

Achin' to see all that they see
Still telling lies to the remains of respect
Creatures we are worth defending

Given to you without ending
Given to you, the purpose of art
Thousands of plans, I've made many
I wonder just how many plans I have made

Here's to the closing of the age.

Here's to you my little loves with blessings from above
Now let the day begin
Here's to you my little loves with blessings from above

Here's to you my little loves with blessings from above
Let the day begin
Here's to you my little loves with blessings from above
Now let the day begin, let the day begin, let the day start

The Call,"So here we are all alone
As the wine makes you mine for the night
Soft is the way that you feel
And hard is the way that we breathe
In out we're moving
Around with the dirt on the floor
I know what I lack is devotion
And I can't fight this off anymore

We'll go surrender to the night
We won't look back at our lives
And when you sleep I'll be there
To kiss your lips to breathe your air
Right or wrong it must go on
After this night we'll leave it all behind 

Two hearts beat as one
As I open my eyes
Well do you want to keep going?
Cause I've already come all undone

We'll go surrender to the night
We won't look back at our lives
And when you sleep I'll be there
To kiss your lips to breathe your air
Right or wrong it must go on
After this night we'll leave it all behind 

Now she's calling
And it hurts me to go
Away from my favourite addiction
There's no way that she'll ever know

We'll go surrender into our lives
When you sleep I'll be there
To kiss your lips to breathe your air
Right or wrong it can't go on
After this night we'll leave it all behind
But I'm still feeling
Drawn to you
In my dreams
So it seems
The man in me always
Gets his way
Never pays
For what he has done
I need you now, love, love, love
I crave you now, love, love, love",Surrender
The Call,"You surround me, covered
You seduce my soul
All my fears uncovered as my life unfolds
In the warmth of your arms

You awake my senses
I was torn in doubt
Losing all defenses
When you called me out

I return to the heart of a love eternal
Waiting there for me

",Uncovered
The Call,"You may find a better way
You may find the reason for it all
Say you walked on holy ground
Say you heard the sweetest sound of all
But you find that you never really cared
You find out that you have no love to share at all

So you challenge everyone you meet
Crying out to fill a void in you
What are you running from my love
What's this thing you're guilty of
Follow me and never feel accused

But you never do believe a word I say
And you never did believe there'd be day of reckoning

So you run and you run and you run
And you never stop
And you work and you work
Until you drop
You're in over your head and the pressure just don't quit
But you can't escape the reach of love

Faces haunt you in your dreams
Struggles of the broken heart I fear
Waking from a fitful sleep
Dutifully appointments keep
Try to hold this image of respect
So someone tells you when and where to go
But all the time you never really show your feelings

So you run and you run and you run

And you never stop
And you work and you work
And you work until you drop
You're in over your head and the pressure just don't quit
But you can't escape the reach of love

The reach of love
Ooh of love

You may find a better way
You might find the reason for it all
You may hold a better hand
All your pride and understanding
Never really feeling love at all
But what you thought were distant worlds apart
Pulls you in and wraps around your heart forever",You Run
The Call,"You doubt if there's a heaven
You doubt if there's a hell
You doubt if you'll remember
All the stories they would tell
It's a terrible feeling

Living and dealing with doubt
You've doubted your existence
You doubt if there's a truth
Your plan starts to crumble
But you cannot stand to lose
You're back where you started from

Covering yourself in doubt
You doubted your mother
And you doubted your dad
You doubted your sisters
And any brothers you had
It's a bad situation

Living and loving with doubt
Well, you doubted the beginning
And I'm sure you doubt the end
You doubted your teachers
You doubt all your friends
It's an overwhelming sensation

Confrontation with doubt
I don't know why I started
I don't know if I'll finish
I wonder why I try at all
Sometimes I wonder why I try at all

Doubt can make a strong man
Weaken under stress
And doubt can make a weak man
Totally worthless
God, it's a pity
Doubt

You stage your finale
With meticulous care
Your view is consistent
And then out of nowhere
Your vision is clouded
You face competition with doubt",Doubt
The Call,"I feel the heavy hand of truth upon me
I feel the deadly sin of pride
It separates the highest form the lowly
It separates love from you and I
I hear the taunting voice of sure temptation
I hear the rantings of a child
An inner voice telling me I'm nothing
The voice is mine, subject to the lie
Heavy hand on heart
Healing words to impart
Heavy hand on my throat
This is no dream
This is no dream
I see the haunting glow of pure surrender
A shapeless light reveals the hidden vow
I can see the countless sons of thunder,
With their knowing eyes circling around me
I feel divisions in this crowd
Heavy hand on my heart
Healing word to impart
Heavy hand on my throat
This is no dream
This is no joke",Heavy Hand
The Call,"Modern Romans, false gods

World domination, runaway greed
Maybe, just maybe, maybe its true

The Call,"So where to begin
Let's start with a child
And where will it end
Where the perfect guest meets his fate
In a scene beyond dreams
I stand where i stand
Convinced by the sight
We hold in our hands
Darkness and light
Where they meet
In a scene beyond dreams
And a mother cries
And she cries
So we watch, and we wait
And we watch, and the hero dies
So where do we fit
Earthbound and chained
Can this be it
Visions of prophets and kings
From a scene beyond dreams
Scattered and armed
Fuel to the fire
Compassion, alarm
Images fade into scenes beyond dreams
The awaited appears branded with lies
Calls to is own loved and despised
From a scene beyond dreams
And a mother cries, and she cries
And we watch, and we wait
And we watch, and the hero dies

The Call,"Tremble Lyrics
First born, grace begins
More bones, more skin
Veins surround me like a nest
Tie me in, first caress
Home
	A womb to grow human in
	A world to grow human in
	Tremble
First breath, light surrounds
More sight, more sound
Immortal art, hands in wood
Freedom's form born to be rejected
Hopefully we labor on
Endlessly we labor on
Tremble
Last words, life begins
More bones, more skin
Grave clothes are cast away
Love returns faithfully
Home
We mock the world
'Cause we cannot see
We mock the world heartlessly

The last one to enter
Dearer than the first
The last one to enter

Endlessly we labor on

The Call,"Turn A Blind Eye Lyrics
To the desperate young, turn a blind eye
To the old and lonely, turn a blind eye
To our inhumanity
To our death dealing vanity
To the methods of persuasion, turn a blind eye
To the masters of evasion, turn
To the science of control, turn a blind eye
To a world in chains, turn
To the sellers of illusion, turn a blind eye
To masters of confusion, turn a blind eye
To a hollow culture
To the circling vulture 
To lovers of power, turn a blind eye
To the resurrection
To a world in chains, turn
I don't want to get involved
It's not my problem
I'll just ignore it
I don't want to feel this
To the starving children, turn a blind eye
To your own redemption, turn
To the horror of extinction
To a world in chains, turn

The Call,"Well they blew the horns

Sends him ruin
Love rebuilds him

Hear the moanings of regret
From the schools of revolution

Oh, but listen

It seems wars are meant to happen
And pain is meant to be
But if hope is eternal
Then a hiding place for you and me

The Call,"Saw a man's home, a box made of cardboard
Frozen to the bone, can't take much more
He says Lord I need help here, send me a strong hand
To lift me from the street, help me to stand

I've been forgotten, been forsaken
Poisoned by a bottle I could not shake it
I've been passed over, been rejected

And I'm afraid I'll never feel
The warmth of summer come again
Man I am helpless, I'm freezing
You were there, you were there

I saw a sick man on a sick bed
Scorned by the world like he had two heads
He says I'm a man here dying a cruel death
I'm cut off from the world, man it was so sad

He was suffering, he was ailing
Tortured by his fate, his body was failing
He says I'm an outcast, left defenseless

And I'm afraid that I'll be dead
Before the summer comes again
I've been rejected, man I am dying
You were there, you were there

Saw a rich man alone in a dark house
A prison made of gold he could not break out
He says my life is aimless, it just seems pointless
Boredom truly kills, man I am hopeless

I got diamonds, I got houses
I got silver clouds and silver spoons to match it
I've come up empty, man I am desperate

And all the crazy things that you put me through 
Now I'm coming around, Throwing it back to you 
Were you thinking of me when you kissed him

All the while I showered you with trust and promises

To get back all that I lost then 
I gave you all I had to give, but I could never reach you

Adrienne, I thought I knew you 
Once again, you used me, used me 
Adrienne, I should have left you 
Long before you used me, Used me up

I treated you like a shining star 
But in my sky all burnt out you are 
And I'll have the last laugh, when I see you walking with some other guy 
'Cause I know you're gone end up all alone 
So take these words, some good advice 
All you've done gonna come back twice 
You never cared how much it hurt, I really need to tell you

Could it be any harder to say goodbye and without you
Could it be any harder to watch you go, to face what's true
If I only had one more day

And how I wish that I could turn back the hours
But I know I just don't have the power

Turn away from all the suffering
That surrounds
Our time on this earth
For some their life has been a curse
I say I'm sorry and I should change
You know it just could be me someday

So we laugh, and we smile
And we play our games of sweet denial
But don't tell me we're forgiven
If we hold, all our breath
If we kneel right down and just repent
You can't tell me we're forgiven

There's no way out of here
I don't want to die, and leave it all behind
Each day part of me disappears
But who am I to judge, what's been sent from above

So we laugh, and we smile
And we play our games of sweet denial
But don't tell me we're forgiven
If we hold, all our breath
If we kneel right down and just repent
You can't tell me we're forgiven

We can't laugh
We can't smile
When so much just ain't right
It can't go on forever
If we hold, our breath
If we kneel down and repent

You can't tell me we're forgiven",We're Forgiven
The Calling,"So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place
When I'm gone you'll need love to light the shadows on your face
If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone, could you make it on your own

If I could, then I would,
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you through the darkest of your days
If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
Then I hope there's someone out there who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would,
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind, I'll stay with you for all of time

I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go

In a life of our times
Shrugging signs there's no chance for us

You never thought I'd succeed 
And though I've given you all I can
You show no faith in me

And I can see that nothing's changed at all
Though we falter, we don't have to fall
And I can see that nothing's changed at all

And the pressure was on
You always told me to do my thing

Though we falter, we don't have to fall
And I can see that nothing's changed at all

They'll spit them out and spin me right back through the door

From the skies where they reign
Can't find shelter for myself

All the while I showered you with trust and promises
What I'm needing now is some sweet revenge
To get back all that I lost then
I gave you all I had to give, but I could never reach you

Adrienne, I thought I knew you
Once again, you used me, used me

Long before you used me, Used me up

But in my sky all burnt out you are
And I'll have the last laugh, when I see you walking with
some other guy

Could it be any harder to watch you go, to face what's true

A quick fix of hope is what I'm needing
And now i wish that i could turn back the hours
But i know i just don't have the power

As if its your last, I know its your last,

Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel,
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not
then,"" said the
Angel,
""Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;

Seen your flag on the marble arch and

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation

Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

Coming home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

On the road and hanging by a song

Now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky mountain high

Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

The Canton Spirituals,"Why must I be the thief, 
Why must I be the thief, 
Oh Lord, please won't you tell me 
Why must I be the thief, 
Why must I be the thief, 

""Please"", said today a man 
And how come you're the only one 
Who's beggaring, who always stays? 
Why must I be the thief, 

But I stop the hanging man. 
How come you're the only one 
Living by the open hand? 
Now why must I be the thief, 

Why must I be the thief, 
You cursed the butterfly 
And the holy man who bowed his head 
Looked the Arctic height. 

The thief tried that cross 
To shed the other's face, 
But the Jesus man said, Not now, 
I'd rather not now, it's far too late, 
Far too late, far too late, 
Far too late, far too late, 
Far too late, far too late, 
Far too late. 

Do what you must, 
Take what you can, 
Steer the part of every heart, 
Every elder man, every elder man, 
Every elder man. 

I'm the thief, I am the thief 
And you're my heart, yes, and you're my heart, 
But I got you then, yes I will 
'Cause you're, 'cause I missed just your flight, 

Just your flight, 
Fly, fly, fly, fly, 
Fly, fly, fly, fly, 
I'll get you late 'cause it's just goodbye, 
I'll get you late, it's just goodbye, 
I'll get you late, it's just goodbye.",The Thief
The Cantrells,"You told me all about her 
Underneath the shooting stars 
How you love her but you leave her 
And you can't go very far 
Away until you're back again 
Starting it all over 
And we watched the stars fall from the sky 
But we never ran for cover 

[Chorus]
And I said there goes one 
Lighting up the sky 
There goes one 
Gone so very fast, watch how they fly 
There goes one 
Lighting up the night 
There goes another shooting star 
Too late, it's passed you by 

The northern summer's cool night air 
Made us feel like dancin' 
Or maybe it was talk of love 
Or stories of romancin' 
But when you stopped and looked at me 
And you asked me what I thought 
I looked above and I searched the stars 
And the answer that I got was

The Cantrells,"There's a flower that grows in the shape of a rose 
And its beauty is with me wherever I go 
But its sweetness was lost in the winter's first frost 
And the chill has stayed ever with me 

[Chorus]
Oh, a long time ago when the world was still bright 
There was fortune far as I could see 
And this blossom still shines in the heart of my mind 
But it holds only sorrow for me 

Oh, the bitter winds blow in a sad tremolo 
And they stir 'round the memory of our long ago 
But the winds have no power to blow away my sorrow 
And so it sits ever with me 

[Chorus: x2]

And this blossom still shines in the heart of my mind 
But it holds only sorrow for me",Under the Rose

Years full of tears and regret;

Where his circus stays 
He loves Sundays 

He's lonely 
Sitting by the river 
Still broken, 
Undressed now, 
Ready for a new town

Their favorite part 
That gives them a laugh 
They love his show 
Their favorite part 
Relaxes their hearts",Sunday Circus Song

Raised in teacup
Sticked down to sleep
Like an envelope
Filled up with words for you

Wrapped up in curls
Sweet as the summer
Cheek soft as a fur
Grace in a slumber

Soft beams from an early sun
On my truly beautiful one
Shimmer from a Saturday sun
On my truly beautiful one

Rise in the morning
Shine 'til the dawning

Down from the rooftops
Sticked down to sleep

Filled up with words for you",Beautiful One

Haven't changed, haven't much to say
But man, I still think those cats are great
They were asking if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
I told them you were living downtown
Driving all the old men crazy
The boys are back in town
You know the chick that used to dance a lot
Every night she'd be on the floor shaking what she'd got
Man when I tell you she was cool, she was red hot
I mean she was steaming
That night over at Johnny's place
Well this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man we just fell about the place
If that chick don't want to know, forget her
Friday night they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's bar and grill
The drink will flow and blood will spill
If the boys want to fight, you'd better let them

It won't be long till summer comes

So why don't we stay here?
The hour is late
And this ain't a bad place
So why don't we stay?

The road's an old friend, we've walked it forever
And wandered away

Away...

Got dirt in my eyes
And ran out of water, conversations ran dry
We got lost in the highway
We're stuck in the north now
So why don't we stay?

The road is my friend, but friends are forever
And roads like to bend

Bend...

We've gone a long way...

No radio stations,
No signal to send
The road is my friend
But this is the end

They say ""what's it to ya?""

And I

I'm one of a few survivors
I'm a drawer labelled ""lost and found""

They'll give us something, fill our empty cups
Sit down in the boat, don't spill it

We wait
Yes we wait
And we wait
And we wait
We will wait

You can hear it in the beat they march to
And you can feel the earth shake when they start to dance
You can tell by the way they move you
It's not murder, it's an act of faith, baby

And as the world moves faster
Whip lashing us round and round
It's quite a slow disaster
But people keep on falling down

As they wait
We wait

Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you

The Carter Brothers,"Always alone
Never with a herd
Prettiest mare I've ever seen
You'll have to take my word

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand

Well I was up on Stony Ridge
After this chestnut mare, been chasing her for weeks
Oh I'd catch a glimpse of her every once in a while
Taking her meal, bathing, fine lady
This one day I happen to be real close to her
And I saw her standing over there
So I snuck up on her nice and easy
Got my rope out
And I flung it in the air!

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand
And we'll be friends for life
She'll be just like a wife
I'm going to catch that horse if I can

And I got her and I'm pulling on her
And she's pulling back like this mule going up a ladder
And I take a choice and I jump right up on her
Damned if I don't land right on top of her
And she takes off, running up onto the ridge
Higher than I've ever been before
She's running along just fine
'Til she stops and something spooked her
It's a sidewinder, all coiled and ready to strike
She doesn't know what to do for a second
But then, she jumps off the edge, me holding on

Above the hills, higher than eagles were gliding
Suspended in the sky
Over the hill
Straight for the sun we were riding
My eyes were filled with light
Behind those black walls
Below was a bottomless canyon
Floating with no sound
Ghosts far below
Seemed to be suddenly rising
Exploding all around

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand
And we'll be friends for life
She'll be just like a wife
I'm going to catch that horse if I can

We were falling
Down this crevice
About about a mile down it seem
And I looked down
And I see this red thing below us coming up real fast
And it's our reflection that's
This little pool of water about six feet wide and one foot deep
And we're falling down right through it
We hit, we splashed it dry
That's when I lost my hold
And she got away
But I'm gonna try and get her again some day

I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand
And we'll be friends for life
She'll be just like a wife

ever coming back.

Is she hid out with another
or is she trying to get back home?
Is she wrapped up in some other's arms?

or is she having a real good time?
Has she forgotten all about,
or is the girl still mine all mine?

Running o'er the C&O road just 20 minutes behind
Running into Seville headquarters on the line
Receiving their strict orders from the station just behind


Running into Hampton, the engineer was there
George Allen was his name, with curling golden hair
His fireman, Jack Dixon, was standing by his side
Awaiting for strict orders while in the cab to ride


Georgie's mother came to him with a bucket on her arm
Saying, my darling son, be careful how you run
For many a man has lost his life in trying to make lost time
And if you run your engine right you'll get there just on time


Mother, I know your advice is good and later I'll take heed
I think my engine is all right, I'm sure that she will speed
O'er this road I need to go at the rate of a cannonball
And when I blow for the stockyard gate I'm sure they'll hear my call


Up the road she darted, against the rocks she crashed
Upside-down the engine turned, poor Georgie's breast it smashed
His head was against the firebox door, the flames were rolling high
I'm glad I was born for an engineer, on the C&O road to die


The doctor said to Georgie, my darling boy, be still
Your life may yet be saved if it is God's blessed will
Oh, no, said Georgie, that will not do, I want to die so free
I want to die for the engine I love, one hundred and forty-three


The doctor said to Georgie, your life cannot be saved
Murdered upon the railroad and laid in a lonesome grave
His face was covered up with blood, his eyes you could not see
And the very last words poor Georgie said was nearer, my God, to Thee",Engine 143

And it's a pity that most people like me
Have to try everything for themselves
I realize now that you always knew just what you were talkin' about
And mama for all that hard work you did
And for the sacrifices you made for us
I just wanna say, thanks a lot

Dear Mama, now that we'reolder
We can see the load on your tired old shoulders
Mama you're a trooper, Mama you're a soldier
Mama, you mean a lot to me
Mama, you mean a lot to me",A Song to Mama
The Carter Family,"One morning as I rambled all down the seashore
The wind it did whistle and the waters did roar
I heard a fair damsel make a pitiful sound
It sounded so lonesome in the waters around

I never will marry or be no man's wife
I expect to live single all the days of my life
The shells in the ocean shall be my deathbed
The fish in deep water swim over my head

She plunged her fair body in the ocean so deep
She closed her blue eyes in the waters to sleep
My love's gone and left me, the one I adore
She's gone where I never will see her any more

I never will marry or be no man's wife
I expect to live single all the days of my life
The shells in the ocean shall be my deathbed
The fish in deep water swim over my head",I Never Will Marry
The Carter Family,"My love is dead and buried yonder
Beneath the weeping willow tree
What wrecks my life and makes me wonder
Is because she died for me

Then lay me down in death beside her
For she's all this life to me
That I may join and e'er caress her
In a land beyond the sea

Yes she died before I told her
That I loved her true and kind
And that I did not mean to fool her
But she left me to repine

God shall I ever get forgiveness
For the deeds that I have done
And meet up yonder her sweet charming
For I know she did me some",Weeping Willow
The Carter Family,"Twas on one dark and stormy night
The snow was on the ground
The sailor boy was at his post
His ship was outward bound

His sweetheart standing by his side
She mourned a bitter tear
Though as he pressed her to his side
He whispered in her ear

Farewell, my own true love
This parting gives me pain
And you will be my guiding star
Till I return again

And then I think of you, my love
While storms are raging high
Then oh, sweetheart, remember me
Your faithful sailor boy

'Twas sad to say the ship returned
Without the sailor boy
For he had died while on the sea
His flag was held most high

Farewell, my own true love
This parting gives me pain
And you will be my guiding star
Till I return again

And as his shipmate steps on shore
To tell that he was dead
The letter that he gave to her
These words it sadly read

Farewell, my own true love
On earth we'll meet no more
So may we meet in heaven above
Where parting is no more",Sailor Boy
The Carter Family,"I was born in East Virginia
North Carolina I did go
There I met a fair, young maiden

Cheeks were roses red

Where I longer to lay my head

I don't want your watch and chain
All I want is your heart, darling

I'm remembering people I miss, the lips I've kissed, and the grocery list 
I'm remembering staying up all night, the northern lights and your dress on tight 
I'm remembering your skin and the sunlight coming in 
And guitar strings and foolish things 
I'm remembering a voice singing, I can almost see the words ringing 
I'm remembering the wind and the way it moves green fields like waves on a holiday 
I'm remembering dreaming of a place I'd be but I'm here 

I'm remembering your skin and the sunlight coming in 
And guitar strings and foolish things 
And whatever else the day brings 

I'm remembering something that you said years ago 
It was something small, really nothing at all 
But now I'm wondering what it means 
The winter sun, the autumn trees, birds on a branch 
And the price of things and telephone rings 
And the bell goes and the day is done 
And I have a beer in the fading sun 
And then I come home to your skin and the sunlight coming in 
And guitar strings and foolish things 
And whatever else the night brings 
I'll be remembering

Well it seems as though this light will never turn green 
I've been driving for a while, can't tell where I've been 
I got nothing on my mind, I got nothing to do 
I'm just driving around listening to Nebraska 

Well, my girl, she told me last night I'm not the one 
Half my heart was ripped out but I still got some 
And if this light should stay red 
I'll be sitting here listening to Nebraska 

I was trying so hard to get to you 
Now I'm driving so far to forget you 
Well, tonight I should be lying with you in a never-ending night 
Well, tonight I should be lying in a never-ending kiss 
But I'm alone on this dark road listening to Nebraska

Janey rides through the cheating part of town 
She got up once then she got let down 
Where lies spit up and then they lie back down 
She sits up and you come to her with moistened lips 
Your face is dry but your fingers drip 

You got a lot of nerve coming around here 

Janey's momma does pirouettes inside 
For a host of brokers who can't believe their eyes 
She nails dirt under their fingers with her eyes 
They they charge out through the door 
And through the night 
Baptising what they think is right 
And washing down the dirt with all their might 

There don't seem to be any room 
There don't seem to be a way 
That the flowers on the ground 
Won't get pushed out of the way 

She has lit a junk house fire into the sky 
You wanna ask but you really know why 
And you think you can live while she dies
",Nerve
The Cash Brothers,"I find myself standing in my room 
Holding on to you 
We got no language to describe what we go through 
Am I the only one living inside my head 
Am I the only one who can't get out of bed 

You are so precious in your pain 
So precious in your years 
In your lips and in your fears 
In your visions and your song 

Am I the only one thinking that something's wrong 
Am I the only one not dead and gone 

In the court of the electronic god 
I stand accused of wanting to love and be loved by you 

Am I the only one singing this song 
Am I the only one, where have my friends gone

",The Only One
The Cash Brothers,"I'm standing at the raceway 
And I've got dust in my hair 
For some reason I feel lonely 
For some reason I don't care 
Watching them pack their cars away 
Where they'll be tomorrow 
Ain't where they are today 

ANd I've been thinking about your sweetness 
And I can't wait to wrap my arms around this 

I'm standing at the raceway 
And I'm singing a song 
I'm standing at the raceway 
Knowing soon I'll be gone 

And I've been thinking about your sweetness 
And I can't wait to wrap my arms around it

Show me the reason why because it's not clear in my mind 
I got a lot of space, I just don't have a place 
The tractor's efforts are in vain, in stopping the hurricane 
Even the actors can feel real rain 

There you are on the big screen floating downstream 
Walls closing in, it ain't no sin to need something 
Hard is never easy but easy shouldn't be this hard 

Show me the reason I feel these things this way 
Do I always need words for the things that I say

And you're wondering what it's coming to 
And you're wondering how you will get through 
You're seeing red and you're feeling blue 
Aren't you 

Falling through this burning sky like a celebration about to die 
Raining on this dead parade like mannequins so afraid 

I dream awake, I just can't fake it 
I dream awake, I just can't take it 

Through the sitcoms and the hurricanes 
The shooting stars and the pouring rain 
Over the concrete mountain range 
I'm feeling good, yeah I know it's strange 

I'm not trying to be cute 
I know there's some dispute 
Between the things I've made 
And the things that I'm afraid of

I am waiting like a farmer for rain 
Like a healer for pain 
Like a clown for a joke 

I am waiting like eyes for sight 
Like the weak for might 
Like the day for night 

I am waiting for the right to speak 
I am waiting for the news to leak 

I am waiting, I'm waiting all night for you 
Like fire for fuel, like a tongue for a taste 

I am waiting in the desert sand 
I am waiting for your command 
I am waiting in the wings 
Yeah, I hear the angel of light sing 

I am waiting to walk on through

Oh I know my job's just working in a store 
I've got an L on my forehead and a stupid uniform 
It's 7/11, it's twenty-four seven 
I'm the night shift guru, made to serve you 
How do you do 

And I'm watching myself performing on tv 
And it's an 8 by 5, 7/11 screen 
And I'm punching in potato chips 
And sugared water and cigarettes and dream magazines 

Flourescent ceiling light, well it's alright in the day 
But it lights the nighttime like a freak show parade 
Grandmothers and lovers, kid brothers bus drivers and whores 
But they're looking for more, they're looking for more 

And I'm watching myself performing on tv 
And it's an 8 by 5, 7/11 screen 
And I'm punching in potato chips 
And sugared water and cigarettes and dream magazines 
Presidents and condiments and cheese 
Squeeze 'em hard and what you get is grease 
And I'm punching in anti-freeze and condoms and processed cheese 
And me here to please
",Night Shift Guru
The Cash Brothers,"She tells me everything's alright 
She tells me it don't always got to be a fight 
And in her eyes she's seen the hard way 
And if she's gonna talk like that I'm gonna hear what she says 

And she says take a little time out of your day 
Take a little time out of your day 
Take a little time out of your day before it takes you away 

She tells me nothing's wrong 
She tells me everything's a song 
And when the band's playing right in tune 
The feeling's pretty good in the room 

Now you may think she's insincere 
Only hearing the things she wants to hear 
But with your party charms and your false alarms 
And your telephone tidal waves tell me what do you hear

",Take a Little Time
The Casiotones,"It's been tough, livin rough
But you're here stay
Six feet under the ground
Is not as hard as it sounds ok

Gittin' high, seein' with three eyes on a rainy day
Been dusted, busted, blown away
Gittin' in your ear, nothin' to fear
Let the music play

Big or tall, it's gonna hit you all
Or get out the way
Come along baby, soundin' strong baby

We all gotta pay

The Casket Lottery,"Look at that, all is lost. all I try to do is form a thought...for me. but these days everything is fading away. so long sweet memory. farewell and good riddance. now I don't remember exactly what is missing. what is missing? moving mountains in my mind. searching for the spot where everything went to die. we all wait where you went to die. check it out, its all gone. somewhere in there used to be a lot. but these days my one track mind dead ends.



",Keep Searching
The Casket Lottery,"This is stranger than I thought
Six different ways inside my heart
And everyone I'll keep tonight
Six different ways go deep inside
I'll tell them anything at all
I know I'll give them more and more
I'll tell them anything at all
I know I'll give the world and more
The think I'm on my hands and head
This time they're much too slow
Six sides to every lie I say
It's that American voice again
It was never quite like this before
Not one of you is the same
This is stranger than I thought
Six different ways inside my heart
And everyone I'll keep tonight
Six different ways go deep inside



",Six Different Ways
The Casket Lottery,"Uncle Jack, when I look back, sent a lot down to me. my mom would say we both seemed to be the life of the party. he was a picker, and a drinker. he took one step over the edge. a drinker, and he ended up with some debt I guess. nobody knows what really happened. the river was swollen when they found him in it, and it rained all weekend on the bridge leaving town. this is how I see it. this is not something I was told. I envisioned it to be dark, wet, and cold. if he jumped, or if he fell, no one knows. but I've got a different picture for each one of those. I was a baby. and we never really met, its really sad, I guess. he was a musician, just like his nephew and if he couldve I wouldve wanted him to teach me. but all I ever got from him, Uncle Jack, was his need to stop drinking.



",The Bridge
The Casket Lottery,"Another weekend night. Every other night.
Every time's a good time to get out of the house.
Plenty of friends around, always up for heaading downtown.
Just as long as she can get out of the house.

I guess it's going on two years since she filled that house with tears.
All the stitching fell apart and she could no longer call it a home.
Her husband ran away when all the problems came.
Yeah, that quitter quit and he left his wife all alone.

Here's to hoping she won't rush into things.
If there's one thing she needs to learn is how to play it safe.
Her dad is always there, her brother's down the street.
And I hope she knows she can call anytime she needs.

If she's had too much to drink. If she just can't get to sleep.
If something goes wrong and she's stuck on the side of the road.
If there's one thing she needs to learn, besides how to play it safe,
Is that no matter how she feels she should never ever feel alone.

She's bettter off without all these bastards who only lie when they talk.
She's better off filling up her closet, filling up the void, and feeding her dogs.
She's better off, knowing it doesn't matter that he's gone.
She's better off moving on

The sun is up she's on her way to work 
And on the drive she's thinking about 
That jerk who tried to pick her up last night.
She's feeling sorry for his wife. 

Wondering if he's got kids wondering where their father is.
The only thing she knows for sure is,
She's better off without all these bastards tho only lie when they talk.
She's better off filling up her closet, filling up the void, and feeding her dogs.

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,

And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?

When you hear her call you across a crowded room,

Like he could

And a triple espresso so you can stay awake
It might be late, but
It’s never too late for that lovin'
My sexy babe

I used to cry but now I have to laugh
Because she’s got that torment 
To a fine art
Smart like a foxy
And crafty as a cat
I’m looking up 
As I’m lying on my back
Bite the beast
If I want a big piece of the pie
But she’s taken the feast
In the blink of an eye
I cannot justify

What’s going on
It feels so right
When it seems so wrong
Like a plot hatched 
In the sweet spot of that trap
Ask what she’s schemes
She say ‘oh this and that’
Then she snaps like a camera 
In black with a flash
Puts the drum in the drama
The hand in the clap
She’s a map with no bearings 
Attached, no 
Safety in this match
Fire you can’t catch
Then zap I was struck by that 
Bolt before dawn
Then by breakfast honey
We was signed and sworn

I’ll give you all night movie marathon

It’s never too late for that lovin'

Something always telling me 
Save prayers before dawn
'Cause what happens when I’m with you
Makes me shake my head then smile and yawn 
I’m worn out but I’m beaming
And it seems that we are dreamy
As we head out through that strange old morning door

This game is no game
But it’s played all the same
And I love it even
If it makes me deranged
It’s like tears in the rain
Burning spears in my brain
Cause me pain sometimes 
Make me drained 
But I cannot complain 
Mad the ugly good and bad
Had some happy with my sad
And some tricks in my bag
When it’s up run a muck
Like a bull that just bucked
When it’s down it’s a drag

And you fight with no partner to tag 
At times I would dive in the sea
To escape from the rising 
And crashing malea
Drink tea with a fat fish
And find a golden key 
Then rise to the surface
And open my baby 
And maybe she’d say ‘we are crazy’
The two of us together like Melbourne weather
Be like balls in a maze see 
We rolling along in obscurity
But when we meet in the middle
Say mmm it’s a treat 

I’ll give you all night movie marathon
And a triple espresso so you can stay awake
It might be late but
It’s never too late for that lovin'

But now I have to cry
Because today my baby tell me
That it’s time to say goodbye
Ask her ‘why what did I do?
You and me we were so sly’
Then she sigh ‘that’s true
We were slinky through and through
But it’s sad and it’s set
I get high then I get depressed
And I guess when we’re together
It’s that happy kind of stress’
Touching left right down 
Kiss my finger I reply
I can’t deny you were the best
And by the best I mean the mess you made

I must confess I never
Met a more sexy maid
That smell like me
So bless your wayward ways
And loving craze and crazy days
And things you’d say
And looks you made
You’re not the queen of hearts
You’re the queen of spades
And you’d take my breath away
Any day that way
So anyway is this the end?
Is this the fifth act of the play?
I kissed her then I turned 
And was about to walk away 
When I sense a little tingle
That begin down from below
Then I hear her with a whisper
You’re the most gullible man I know",Lullaby
The Cat Empire,"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way

Plenty of room at the Hotel California

She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine
He said, ""we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say""

They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Well I don't mean to come across too sexual, oh, oh
But that ass is epic though
Titanic Saga, volcanic, hot lava, we burning up, I can serve it up
Like Luke I am your father
Only if you wanna, take a dip in each other waters
Take this bedroom and turn it into a sauna

She's sending me drinks, I fed her one back
She said hey boy, you're drinking too fast
And we can take it slow, you'll never be alone
She's telling me ""All you tonight"", lift me up
All you tonight, fill my cup
All you tonight, get me through, all you tonight
All you

If I want her, I'ma get her
Send the waitress over
Quit that bullshit girl, bend that ass over
Mr. Round of Applause, I can do it with no hands up
I go hard in the paint, she ain't even gotta change
Talk about yourself, bring a couple friends
...I'm in japan, Tell yo friends I'm the man, ask your man
Drop it, Wipe me down, make that ass clap, clap
Make that ass clap, clap

She's sending me drinks, I fed her one back
She said hey boy, you're drinking too fast
And we can take it slow, you'll never be alone
She's telling me ""All you tonight"", lift me up
All you tonight, fill my cup
All you tonight, get me through, all you tonight
All you

All you tonight, lift me up
All you tonight, fill my cup
All you tonight, get me through, all you tonight
All you

If I want her, I'ma get her
Send the waitress over
Quit that bullshit girl, bend that ass over
Bend that ass over
Quit that bullshit girl, bend that ass over

All you tonight, lift me up

We was out on a back road
My and my woman was just getting' right
All systems on overload
The radio blasting in the front seat
Turning out the music fine
We was snuggled up in the back seat
Making up for lost time

Steamy windows - zero visibility
Steamy windows - coming from the body heat

You can wine and dine a woman all night
With good intent
But there's something about a confrontation on a back road
Breaks down the defense

Steamy windows - ain't nobody can see
Steamy windows - coming from the body heat

There's a sound outside the front door
And I know it's just the wind
But it makes her snuggle up just a little bit closer
And it starts things happening again

The Cathedrals,"Tempted and tried, we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long;
While there are others living about us,
Never molested, though in the wrong.

[Chorus]
Farther along we'll know more about it,
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine,
We'll understand it all by and by.

Sometimes I wonder why I must suffer,
Go in the rain, the cold, and the snow,
When there are many living in comfort,
Giving no heed to all I can do.

Tempted and tried, how often we question
Why we must suffer year after year,
Being accused by those of our loved ones,
E'en though we've walked in God's holy fear.

Often when death has taken our loved ones,
Leaving our home so lone and so drear,
Then do we wonder why others prosper,
Living so wicked year after year.

""Faithful till death,"" saith our loving Master;
Short is our time to labor and wait;
Then will our toiling seem to be nothing,
When we shall pass the heavenly gate.

Soon we will see our dear, loving Savior,
Hear the last trumpet sound through the sky;
Then we will meet those gone on before us,
Then we shall know and understand why.",Farther Along

To see this man from Galilee
Just a carpenter some say, leading fools astray
Yet many kneel to give Him praise

He speaks His Father's words
For He comes in the name of the Lord

There is strength in the name of the Lord
There is power in the name of the Lord
There is hope in the name of the Lord
Blessed is He, who comes in the name of the Lord

And when my strength is nearly gone
When there's nothing left to do but just depend on You

Just stay home and kick around

You ought to get it right the first time
If I can't have my say
I'll take the cup supplied to me
And fill it up
Send it away, 
Results next day 

Town on a leash
Clowns on a spree
Invading, foam rubber violence
High balloon finance 
Ancestry, dog to a tree
Come on and join in the pile up
Nine hundred dial up 

Don't test me this way
Was looking forward to the next phrase
Doubt that I'm okay
My trousers drop with good reason
Exercise my right to obey, 
Do it today 

Nevermore will you crawl around again
We'll sign your face
And tenderize your brain my friend 
So when you blunder out
Into the light
Too comfortable to ever turn us in
Never turn us in
Here comes Rosie!

Don't test me this way
You might as well be right the first time
Here's my chance, okay
Just hold your cups in the morning
Breathe it all in and feel great

The Cavedogs,"They built a love grenade
Are all grenades the same?
I think they are
I think this is
They built it to blow us away 

They blew the wind to change
The price was right in range
They're selling to you
They're selling to me
They're crowding the road to the Cape

You're a little bit louder than you ought to be
You're a little bit louder than we
But I can't help it
I bought into the love grenade

We'll be paying for your when you're old
So save it like you're told
Remember back then
Way back when
We'll throw you a love grenade

The Cavedogs,"Wind of sorrow, song of pain 
Make tomorrow an easy thing
She's up on a hillside flogging the dead
Says I'm not gonna go till it blackens my head 
Bring on sorrow, 
Have to borrow 

Banish color and the sane
Ignore the Sabbath and pray for rain
She's up in the evening playing a game
She don't want to know that it's nicely arranged 
Bring on sorrow, 
I will follow 

Draw the curtains, prone on the floor 
Like to kill with a kiss
""Quadrophenia"" blasts down the walls 
Of you and all other kids 
So don't bring up sorrow to me
Don't dream up sorrow to see 


Crown of sorrow, boots of pain 
By tomorrow a fashion thing
I'm up on my highhorse calling her names
I'm not one of you, cause I don't wear your pain 
She dreams up sorrow, 
Still I follow 

(Instrumental Break)




She dreams up sorrow,
A dream she swallows 


Cool coffee lie on the floor
Ashes floating are grim 
Gothic posters, heighten remorse
Asleep she just dreams of him 
So don't bring up sorrow to me 
Don't play with what you can't see
Don't dream of someone, not me 
Or bring back someone to see
Don't leave it sorrow or me
Don't play with what you can't see
Bring out something in me
Don't bring up sorrow to see",Sorrow (Boots of Pain)
The Cavedogs,"A whispered you 
Seeming veiled from views intent 
And hopeless dreams that lent 
These features that aspire 
Forever and forever 
To be what you are 
In monuments of parts and lines 
Whose seams are tired 
As if they might 
Show what's inside and see 
What is awaiting me 
It could shake me from my seat 
It's not too late 
It's not too late 
But you're quietly turning a page 
You're put away

A listless smile 
Like a mistress filing blame 
It wilts back where it came 
Its impact never seen 
Never into never 
Like a broken piece 
That's a token least acclaimed 
But it's all that's saved 
And it's held on tight 
For what it might have seen 
You never came to me 
Just what you'd thought I'd need 
To lead me on 
To lead me on 
But like I was never playing along 
You had gone 
From me.

Voices surrounding me 
With sterile and costly sounds 

Voices surrounding me 
With sterile and costly sounds 

Voices surrounding me 

I don't know where you took me 
But I didn't want to leave 

What you are

Whose seams are tired 
As if it might 
Show what's inside and see

The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.
Oh, let it rain.
I'm a man and I got my pride
Til' it rains I'm gonna stay inside and let it rain.",I Wish It Would Rain

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

Dragged into this world and thrown away
She never wanted you
Better things to do

You won't remember
Drawn to the door
Whizzing through the week
Dancing round the fire with the rest of the freaks

Oh, no, no, things are different now
Don't let these days of doubt
Turn him inside out

His second mother holds him to her breast
She sees her children come and go
Ripping the heart from her
All of them part of her

And some will remember
Time heals all wounds they say
She can't let them
Take her boy away

This son, oh, she would die without
Don't let these days of doubt
Turn her inside out

When she was young
The world was a different place
After all

And his heart is in his home
There helplessly waiting for someone
To smash his world to pieces
Ignorant and cruel, social student fools

Pull him to the right, pull him to the left
Pull him by the arms, pull him by the legs
Let go

Oh, things are different now
Don't let these days of doubt
Turn them inside out

When you were young, they wore a different face
When she was young, the world was a different place
When you were young, they wore a different smile

Seeing shadows cross a stained glass sky

And our consciences and long before

Slowly swerve into view
To tease and tantalize

To sucker your senses and spit out the pieces

She was living in a different world
Or is it a he?

Pull back the curtain my son
I look around, the color has gone
And slowly darkness descends upon me
Paradiso, I know you lied, that much I see

Well the serpent sings his song
To so many sleeping staring eyes
Like sheep they sing along
And clap in time to a heart that's beating

Crazy child, she was wicked
Oh, she was wild
Her eyes are open
Pull back the curtain today

I look around
The color is gray
Gray as the ghost town that towers above me
Paradiso, I know you lied, that much is clear, to me

I see the poet and the fool
Walking hand in hand to school
I recall a lonely outcast and I remember
Laughing children, it was long before
Their eyes were empty, hearts were cold

So, dance this final dance with me
I'll wrap my sting round your spine
Will poison wash away the fear
Wipe the world from my mind?

Look up, what can you do?
I looked around the color was blue
Wise up, It's in your head
I looked around me and the color is red

Red as the words that I read on the wall
Paradiso, kingdoms rise, so must they fall
And only ashes remain in the end
Paradiso, I know you lied, lies without end
I'll see it again and again and again

The Champs,"I was at the bar with my drinkin team
It was me Jack Daniels and my homey Jim Bean
We were kinda blitzed and we were trying to behave y'all
When in walked a soldier he was from the fuzzy naval
We were fallin, stumblin, crawlin
Her come da police, Captain Tom Collins
And the rapper said freeze
He said ""hands in the air and hand over your keys""
Now we did, and that was kinda simple
Now here came Marguarita and her friend Shirley Temple
I asked my friend 'bout Marguarita,
He said Shirley was a virgin an I wouldn't wanna meet her
So I talked to Marguarita, 'cause yoh, she was flyer
I took her to the coast 'cause I wanted to Screw Driver
Now Im not one for a speech
But there was plenty of Tequila and Sex On The Beach, Y'all

Here we go again and I'm not fussin'
See I'm a French Mexican but I can get with White Russians
At the bar with a drink in my hand
In walked Jose Cuervo what was margaritas man
I talked to the wise man 'cause, yoh he's distinguished
His name was St. Ives and he spoke in old English
He said ""you'd better think fast
'Cause Jose is kinda crazy and I heard he Shot Glass""
He gave me some advice and it went like this
""Catch the night train and head up to 'cisco""
I didn't wanna stick around
I caught the 1:51 to New York, the Grey Hound
Now I'm at the Red Zone, everybody's stylin'

The Tequila Gold Label had bombed me
You see I woke up late and wasn't feelin' so great
And Mike said there's a Bicardi party startin' at eight
Yo we walked in the party and started playin our games
We played tops, fuzzy quarters, with Bartles and James
Here came Shirley Temple and they told me to chill
Because the Mickey Brothers took her up to strawberry hill
They took her a thousand mink and she could barely think
'Cause the Tequila that she drank had her tickled pink
Now the music came on and I rocked the instrumental
There's a groupie named Mai Tai, a fly oriental
A groupie is a girl that jocks
She wore the def Black Velvet and drank Scotch on the Rocks
We had a fake marriage, now here's to honeymoon
Ya zone vagabond and the Blue Lagoon

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best

To either quit or follow through.
Just lose faith, or trust your heart,
To somehow lead you through the dark.
Without the only one,
Who's dreaming, who needs help to carry on.
We might get lonely, but we're not alone.

Cause we are sisters, we stand together.
We make up one big family,
Though we don't look the same.

We make each other stronger,

Got the brains, got the power,
And we speak the truth.
We run everything all around the world,
So you best respect the Cheetah Girls.

Working hard for what we deserve.
Trying not, to break the rules,
Cause momma didn't raise no fools.

If it seems we're only dreaming,
And we need help to carry on.
It's good to know we're not alone.

The Cheetah Girls,"When I was just a little girl my mama used to tuck me into bed
And she'd read me a story
It always was about a princess in distress
And how a guy would save her and end up with her glory
I'd lie in bed and think about the person that I wanted to be
Then one day I realized that fairy tale life wasn't for me

I don't want to be like Cinderella
Sittin' in a dark cold dusty cellar
Waitin' for somebody to come and set me free
I don't want to be like someone waiting
For a handsome prince to come and save me
Oh I will survive
Unless somebody's on my side

Don't want to be no no no one else
I'd rather rescue myself

Someday I'm gonna find someone that wants me for my soul heart and mind
Whose not afraid to show that he loves me
Somebody who will understand I'm happy just the way
I am Don't need nobody taking care of me

I will be there for him just as strong as he will be there for me

Right from the start
Ooh, I'm afraid that's ending
And my world is fallin' apart

It's over and I feel so alone
This is a sadness I've never known
How did I let the sweetest of dreams slip away?
And I'm afraid the hurt is here to stay

Promises made, not meant to be broken
From a long time ago
Ooh, so many words still unspoken
Tell me how was I to know?

It's over, never thought it would be
Why in the world did this happen to me
How could I let the sweetest of dreams slip away?
And I'm afraid the hurt is here to stay

I go round and round and round in my head
Wanting to take back whatever I said
No one was right, we all made mistakes
I'm ready to do whatever it takes, please

Don't let it be over
No, this is not how it ends
I need my sisters, my family, my friends
Don't wanna let the sweetest of dreams slip away

Don't let it be over

It always was about a princess in distress and how a guy would save her and end up with her glory 
I'd lie in bed and think about the person that I wanted to be 
Then one day I realized that fairy tale life wasn't for me

I don't want to be like Cinderella 
Sittin' in a dark cold dusty cellar 
Waitin' for somebody to come and set me free 
I don't want to be like Snow White waiting
For a handsome prince to come and save me
On I will survive
Unless somebody's on my side 

Don't want to be no no no one else
I'd rather rescue myself 

Someday I'm gonna find someone that wants me for my soul heart and mind 
Whose not afraid to show that he loves me 
Somebody who will understand I'm happy just the way I am Don't need nobody taking care of me 

I will be there for him just as strong as he will be there for me 
When I get myself ready it has got to be an equal pay
