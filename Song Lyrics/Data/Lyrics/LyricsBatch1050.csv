Musique,"Keep on jumpin', let your body fly
Everybody jumpin' 'til you see the sun in the sky
Keep on jumpin', let your body fly
Everybody jumpin' 'til the mornin' light

Catch the rhythm and the beat
It's movin' your body when you start to feel the beat
You're into the party, music takes me where I want to be
Syncopation makes me high

Keep on jumpin', let your body fly
Everybody jumpin' 'til you see the sun in the sky
Keep on jumpin', let your body fly
Everybody jumpin' 'til the mornin' light

Everybody do your thing, get into the motion
Get on out there on the floor, raise the commotion
Music takes me where I want to be
Happy music makes me fly

Keep on jumpin' let your body fly
Everybody jumpin' 'til you see the sun in the sky
Keep on jumpin', let your body fly
Everybody jumpin' 'til the mornin' light

Keep on jumpin', let your body fly
Everybody jumpin' 'til you see the sun in the sky

Mussilini,"Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
The ghetto motherfucking alarm clock
Wake up nigga

Lord forgive us for sinning, give us this day and our daily bread
Cause if a nigga don't call you back when you beep him, he might be dead
Look at this world we living in, everybody got a bad attitude and a glock
Seem like we living just to become a victim, of a random shot
Everytime I turn my back, another y'all motherfuckers turn and crack
It seem like just yesterday, a young nigga stepped up to the plate and
Learn to bat, military minded at a early age bread to live in a murder maze
I don't want to go to the early grave, a motherfucker like me
Ready to murder maze, I want to go to heaven but not right now
Bout to pushing infrared like dimes, what you want to do it like that
I can play eight to the Penn, cut your lights off right now
Mean what I say and I say what I mean, nigga like me don't play with a beam
When I pull my gun, then I'ma use my gun
And I ain't tripping, I'll put you in a murder scene
But I try to stay humble, and hold what I got
Never let a nigga know what I got, keep my bidness to my own
So don't bring none of that there, to my home
I love my people, and that's a fact
But I want to know, where's the fucking love at
I don't want to put a motherfucker, in the grave
But I will to keep on, keeping on busting back

[Chorus: x2]
Wake up before you get caught up
Don't keep on selling your soul, until your life bought up
And my eyes on the prize, and never fall off the straight and I roll
When you slip, hollow tips are sharper than an arrow

I decided August 31, 1999
There's no more time for fake partnas, there's only time for my grind
All of my friendships came about, because of the verses I say
That nigga Z-Ro got partnas, but what about Joseph McVey
Everytime I'm on the microphone, nigga want to tag along
Want to see me, when I do my song
Or when a nigga be smoking the marijuana, and the dope all gone
A nigga right back, all alone
I had to regulate, or be surrounded by fakes
At all times looking over my shoulder, but I came out of that as I got older
Cause I realized, if it's written scriptures don't lie
That's why I'm thugging cause life is a bitch, and then a nigga die
I rap about the struggle, cause balling is foreign to me
Z-Ro be t-shirt and Dickies, ain't no Ralph Lauren you see
Cause every dolla that I make, is a dolla well earned
And I'm putting it back in the game, to sco' some crack
And a strap, to dip sherms
Hopefully I can make it, to see the sun rise
Fiending for them back in the days, of hide and seek
And throwing mud pies

[Chorus: x2]

Bout to swang by that sun, is wait for me be right back
I'ma roll a optimoe fat as a wiener, and light that
Cause it seems I can't confine without, clutching a sack
Puffing the sho' dipping the black, or raping the track
And I be tripping and sipping, and pimping this rap
I'm writing my rhymes, through my fetty's no slack
I'm ready to the sell the, the better my chedda
Tell her to the fella, I doubts the shredder
A better competitor, I dwell I'ma get her
Better get fella, I sell-a my yella
To hella thoed nigga, that wreck accapella
The fella that tell it, nobody he got em
He got 'em and shot em, and don't talk about em
Plotted and followed, to get where I started
Out of my product, the plot of my problem
Got off my bottom, to talk to my father
My ceiling is ending, my ending is finished
These women keep grinning, to swim in my linen
I'm tilling my bidness, the bidness I'm tilling
I'm tilling my bidness, the bidness I'm tilling
What's up what's up, had lean in my cup
Been asleep ten years, and I just woke up
The alarm on slow, all my ten minutes up
Gotta make my bed, gotta watch my butt
Gotta clean my room, gotta iron my stuff
Gotta wash my car, gotta shine my buck
Gotta change my oil, cause the road is tough
Keep my eyes on the road, and don't slow up

[Chorus: x2]",Wake Up!
Must,"At the end of my tether
Faithless, friendless and wrong
Speed forth revelation
Deliver me from this deathly curse
I've been sat here far too long
Depressed and giving none
My pale skin haunts the sun
I must get moving on
And I've said all this before
But from my life I've been divorced
For love and psycho hum
I must get moving on

Open wound bleed profusely
Drain me till I pass out
Lead me on through the doorway
Ascend in mirth to resplendent rebirth
",Moving On

Still not over those words you said,
Tossin' and turnin' rolling in the night.
She's tying knots, seems that nothing is right.
Sweat on my brow, my adrenaline's flowing,
Eyes burning red, my anxiety's growing.
As soon as I'm asleep, it will be tomorrow,
And that just fills my head full of sorrow.

Insomnia's got the best of me,
I've got no choice but to stare at the ceiling.
Insomnia has a hold on me,
You don't even know the stress I'm feeling.

Clock on the wall's moving faster and faster,
Your voice in my mind like a broken record.
Tossing and turning, rolling in the night.
She's tying knots, seems that nothing is right.

Reminding me again that my day was too long.
Drank all my wine that my cuboard is bare,
Still no escape from this waking nightmare.",Insomnia

About small time things how we love to play

And it all rushed back how it used to be

And I thought to myself that I wanted you back
But I know in my mind that it's only a trap

Everybody's doing their best and realizing
As we watch we see you falling further
The world's in custody for your murder
Is there any hope for you
Is there anything we can do

I look to see
Is the world's catching up to me
Would someone give me something to help me to believe
That you won't be left alone
That you won't be left alone
To carry on and do it on your own

You're making moves
You're making plans
Progress is in you hands
It's not your fault that nobody understands
The pains you feel
They are for real
They slow you down
And re-appear
Just as soon as you
Walk away from here



",Away From Here
Mustard Plug,"I think there's something, you should know
Time to hit the road, find the door, yeah ya gotta go
'cause I been down this road now a million times
I've heard every one of your bullshit lines
If ya think I'm gunna listen just one more time
You got a problem now!

For all I've said
And all I've done
You'll never be
No you'll never be the one

You've come back, said ya mend't your ways
Your dimestore smile don't hide what you betray
I know you ain't no friend of mine
You better find a sucker further down the line

Ya ain't welcome here

Sometimes so near and now so far
Retrace the paces that have brought me here

You know, that I, can't stop counting all the days
That you're not here to say

Lost direction had to ask
I know I wouldn't ever last

Looking back, I'm looking forward,

You told me to go that way
When I get paid you told me that the right way
Was always one more long step further from your last
Take me to the park
Don't leave me after dark
'cause I can't find my way around this town
Even though I've been here
I can't remember last year
Even though I know I've been around
Another turn
Another fork stuck in the road
I read the rules but don't remember all the codes
I took my chances now there is no helping me
I hope you leave a message somewhere
That I'll surely see
You told me to go that way

My old self locked in a cage
Where I have to stand and stay,
Just a moment many day.
Just what I left behind still lives,
I can hear it when I'm still,
Weak connection, lines will cross,
Different lives, we co-exist.

If I could only take the time,
Fade away and crawl inside. I Know
You worry that I'm far away,
At least you know that I'm still safe, I'm safe.

I'm safe.
At least you know I'm safe.
I'm safe.
At least you know...

Now again I hear your voice,
Loudest when we haven't spoke.
Ringing in my ears, drowns
The empty roaring of the crowd.
I'm alone most of the time,
Repenting every single crime.
Absolution in a glass,
But I wake up where I have slept.

If I could only take the time,
Fade away and crawl inside. I Know

At least you know that I'm still safe, I'm safe.

Pen to paper, paper sent to man
Two thousand sixty five degrees
Written in our house amongst the trees

Broken windows, hearts, maybe more
I've licked the stamp and mailed it out
Break the silence, can you hear me shout?

I hope they get it, oh, I hope they get it

Isolation is making me laugh
In these four walls, I write it down
Absolute control of it now

I waited three days to hear from you
Wishing the words could stick like glue
Inside your brain you see mistakes
A forwarding address for my heartbreak

From where you're sitting

With something missing

Catch the drift, don't talk so loud
And then it maybe fits in

I feel I could crawl up insanity walls

Slowing down, that's not the kind I am
I like to speeding
Fences high, so you can move around
That's not my feeling

I feel I could crawl up insanity walls

Listen up, these things just had to stop
I'm turning evil
They grind me down, and try to shove me up

We're drifting into the arena

I'll have to put this to an end
A perfect stranger telling me
That he's my one and only friend

Exit's out, and here I stand
With nothing else but my two hands

Once you have passed the door
No one escape these walls
Sit back, enjoy them fall
Release the dogs...

It's all there in what you dream
And what we saw ain't magic seeds at all

Try to figure out why we stand tall
What you see is what you need
Is why we bleed there's nothing more at all

And cry then wonder why I told such a lie
Are you upset because my poems sometimes make you fret
About the future of things to come

Would you call me a brute
If I wore a suit
Or said I was cute
Do you think I would be a better writer
If my poems were lighter
Spoke more about nature
Or some adventure
That gave me pleasure

Would you love me more
If I spoke less about the poor
And talked about the women I adore

Now after listenin' to this
Are you lookin' for a twist
Or just another rhyme
In the next line

Thew solutions that you seek
Will not be in the streak
Of a pen or even ten line
Of mine 

The problems are the same
But don't blame me because I see
That part of reality
That pains
And stains the heart
I came into this life
With neither guns or knives
I made no laws
With all its flaws
About black and white
And whats wrong from whats right
I speak I write of what I see
Of men holdin' men in slavery
Of color class and greed

So don't blame me if wen I speak
You do feel weak
I did not create
Tell me this now
Would u accuse me of causin' a riot
If I was
Quiet

Mutabor,"In Berlin mal wieder alles grau 
 Und keinen Stoff,und keine Frau 
 Draußen Regen,drinnen kalt 
 Und nichts zu rauchen,und keinen Halt 
 Was macht man in so einem Moment 
 Man leckt sich die Zähne und öffnet sich das Hemd 
 man greift sich an die eigene Brust 
 Und denkt daran,ich muß,und denkt daran,ich muß 
 Mal wieder nach Amsterdam fahr'n 
 Mal einfach so über'n Damm karr'n 
 Schwarzen grünen gelben weißen 
 Ich hoff',das Geld reicht noch fur was zu beißen 
 Ich hoff',das Geld reicht noch für was zu beißen 
 Und ist man dann erstmal da 
 Mit leerem Magen und wirrem Haar 
 Dann packt es Dich an Deinem Schopf 
 Es setzt sich fest I'm Kopf,es setzt sich fest I'm Kopf 
 Und wenn ich dann einen dreh' 
 Schmeckt noch viel besser der Kaffee 
 Alle Knoten ham' sich aufgelöst 
 Meine Seelen sind entblößt, meine Seelen sind entblößt 
 Und ich werde wieder nach Amsterdam fahr'n",Amsterdam

How I'm with the wrong crowd

Where the ugly roams

With ugly people washing dishes
In the kitchen sink

Seen rich, seen poor

Here's a little question to you
Baby tell me if it's gonna have an answer too
I would like to know if you could tell me boy
What's the deal and how we got up on this joint

Tell me if you wanna be with me tonight
Got a feeling you ain't ready but your heart denies
I'm not surprised
'Cause you've done this once before

Hey-yeah

I don't wanna ever have to ask you
'Cause I know you got another
'Baby, how you doing?', and I ain't gonna bother
It's not my game to deal with, do you watch each other

There ain't no playing tonight
You see me looking, no way
Turn around unless it's something
To say to me
If you gotta go, just let me know
'Cause I am not your baby

Oooooh

Baby what's the deal tonight
'Cause I know you wanted more than what you say
'Cause I feel in every move that you put on me boy
Don't act like this ain't something that your heart enjoys

But we gotta put a stop on this, boy
'Cause I ain't feeling that I have to share for you no more
I want you, baby
Need you for myself, don't want nobody else

Says here's my number, won't you call me later
I called you the next day
And that's how we got started

I'm sitting here thinking what we've been through
In front a pile of things reminded me of you
It's weird that so much time hardly takes up any space at all
Things I say for us to look at
Now our future's lost in the past
Gotta put it away, put it away

I don't know how it can fit
'Cause it's all we were, it's all we ever had

Sitting all alone in a paper bag
Maybe I should get rid off this
But it's all the love
It's all the dreams we had
You and me
Sitting on a shelf in a paper bag (sitting, sitting)

The note you wrote when we had our first fly
The car that you bought me
After sharing our first night
I know we had some bad
But we had lots of good times too (good times too)
Some tickets to a concert and a menu
Some pictures from the night
When I lost my queue
It's funny how these things tell the story of our love affair

Can't hold on to us, no longer
If I do I'm going under
Gotta pack it away, pack it away

Don't panic panic Mutya just look ahead now

Didn't need to turn around

Mutya Buena,"Strung out

When we started out
It was fun, so cool
Nothing really heavy
Just a little after school

We were chasing dreams
And living for the day
Live was for the taking
It was such a simple game

I don't know when
And I don't know why
Suddenly I lost you
And a part of you had died

You've gone and taking it to far
I don't recognize who you are, you're

[Chorus:]
Strung out
You're wasting all our love away
I'm running out of words to say
Is there nothing getting through
'Cause I can barely see you
Strung out
Believing that there's nothing wrong
With everything the pain goes on
Tell me what they gonna say
When you shut yourself away

It's a long way down
When you're flying high
No one's gonna catch you
When you've told too many lies

It's hard for me
I'm not that brave
Please God help me now
While there's something left to say

My premonitions are coming true
Just tell me babe, what you are trying to prove?
You're hurting me, breaking me
You still forsaking me
Why can't you see? You're

You're strung out, baby
Yes you are

Am I destined not to feel it?

I don't wanna be in

Why I gotta mess it up
And get it wrong
Like some kind of curse
Oooh

Why do I have to suffer for love
Suffer for love
I've given it everything
Still it ain't happening
I'm sick of it all
What does it want
It's asking too much
I'm a sucker for a suffer for love (yeah)

I wanna be happy
I wanna be laughin'

So I'm gonna take chances
And I'm gonna make the difference

I hate what I've become
But I'm still gonna leave you
And I don't think you should stay for the night

Baby you know that my flesh is weak
You know I simply

I cannot sleep without you
My heart has simply nowhere to go

Nothing to hold
Those tears you're crying

Time and time again you take me back in baby

Look at us dancing baby
Let's dance and show them all
(Dance and show them all)
How close we are

So we go on deceiving

Like you've got something else up your sleeve
That's why I've got to leave

Baby don't wait for me like some angel of tragedy
I have to set you free
Darling you should be long gone, oh long gone by now
You should be with someone, someone

Glisten and shine

There's no fixing what went bad

So many fatal mistakes


I broke every single rule

And I don't think they've made a tool

To fix all my mistakes


When I said good bye

And brought a tear to your eye

That was my mistake


When I told you to go

Cause I just didn't know

That was my mistake


I broke down inside my mind

I thought that I was doing fine

I'm so hard on myself


I broke everything I built

And now I'm living with the guilt

At least I have my health


When I said good bye

And brought a tear to your eye

That was my mistake


When I told you to go

Cause I just didn't know

That was my mistake



Time will heal, bruises fade

Life will change the plans we've made

If we face the truth and be our best

There's no need to worry about the rest


When I said good bye

And brought a tear to your eye

That was my mistake


When I told you to go

Cause I just didn't know

That was my mistake


That was my mistake x2

Best friends making music-we were feeling good,
The top was always down and the sun was always shining bright

I remember singing to the radio,
On a sunset strip-we were driving slow
The top was always down and the stars were always shining bright

The sun was going up when we were laying down,
We felt like kings and we loved that town,
The sun was coming up when we were laying low,
We felt like kings, we were living a dream

Everyone was there so we got into the car,
Heading out to Vegas, didn't get very far,
The top was always down and a tire blew a flat that night

We changed the tire then we turned right around,
Picked up a hitcher all the way into town,
the top was always down with the gas pedal on the ground

The sun was going up when we were laying down,
We felt like kings and we loved that town,
The sun was coming up when we were laying low,
We felt like kings, we were living a dream

We'll be on the town tonight,
And you'll get left if you ain't right
We'll be on the town tonight,
And you'll get left if you ain't right
We'll be on the town tonight

We watched the freaks fade away in the day,
We watched celebrities come out to play,

The sun was coming up when we were laying low,

Your mind takes you to places that it's never been
In a house without a hallway there's nothing more to see
Four walls full of pickup sticks and atrophy

Where the sun shines bright and I don't have to lock my door
Where the moon is full and I'm not tired anymore

Where angels carry me along the way
Where I can close my eyes at night and pray
Where angels sit and watch me while I look up to the sky
Where angels carry me along the way

In a grave without a body, the worms lay all alone
This room is a tomb, it is my home
In a song without a meaning, your mind starts going blank
Send in reinforcements, we need a tank

Where the sun shines bright and I don't have to lock my door
Where the moon is full and I'm not tired anymore

Where angels carry me along the way
Where I can close my eyes at night and pray
Where angels sit and watch me while I look up to the sky
Where angels carry me along the way

Spread your wings around me, take me high into the air
Free prisoners from shackles, teach them they should not despair
In time we all will know our destination, which way we will go

Now that you're on fire, you are like the sun

You've spent some time along this lonesome road
With no one waiting for you back at home
Just breaking hearts and living free and easy
The times have changed and now you're not alone

This road to healing hurts more than anything

Now that you're on fire, you're voice is like the wind
Now that you're on fire, let life begin again
Now that you're on fire, a new day has begun
Now that you're on fire, you are like the sun

More than anything I'd like to see
Better, brighter days for you, for you and me

Now that you're on fire, you're voice is like the wind
Now that you're on fire, let life begin again

Come on, let's bring the noise restrainer to Bremerton
So what's it gonna be and who's comin' with me?
It's time to make a choice on what was never easy

So let's roll with this role remodeling
I refuse to be, I refuse to see
To this role remodeling

Come on, let's smash the glass
Into a thousand words of light
'Cause we're all soldiers here
And yet we haven't learned to fight

The history of our fathers
Hasn't taught us what we need to learn
If we could see the future
Would we see the buildings burn?

So let's roll with this role remodeling
I refuse to be, I refuse to see

there's nothing in the bomb to put the fire in these eyes and burn
We're gonna break the rules but we don't see it as a crime
We're here to change the world and finally this is our time

So let's roll with this role remodeling

[Originally by Poison]

She stepped off the bus out into the city streets,
Just a small town girl, with her whole life packed in a suitcase by her feet,
But somehow the lights didn't shine as bright as they did on her mama's TV screen,
And the work seemed hard, and the days seemed longer than she ever thought they'd be.

But you know you got to stick to your guns when it all comes down,
'Cause sometimes you can't choose,
It's like heads they win, and tails you're gonna lose.

Win big,
Mama's fallen angel,
Lose big,
Living out her lies,
Wants it all,
Mama's fallen angel,
Lose it all,
Rolling the dice with her life.

Now she found herself in the fast lane, living day to day,
Turned her back on her best friends yeah, and let her family slip away,
Just like a lost soul caught up in the Hollywood scene,
All the parties and the limousines,
Such a good actress, hiding all of her pain,
Trading memories for fortune and fame.

Just a step away from the edge of a fall,
Caught between heaven and hell,
Where's the girl I knew a year ago?

Win big,
Mama's fallen angel,
Lose big,
Living out her lies,
Wants it all,
Mama's fallen angel,
Lose it all,
Rolling the dice with her life.

Too much, too soon, or just a little too late,
'Cause when the ship came in she wasn't there, and it just wouldn't wait.

Win big,
Mama's fallen angel,
Lose big,
Living out her lies,
Wants it all,
Mama's fallen angel,
Lose it all,
Rolling the dice with her life,
Win big,
Mama's fallen angel,
Lose big,
Living out her lies,
Wants it all,
Mama's fallen angel,
Lose it all,
Rolling the dice with her life.

But I just can't get no relief, Lord

I work till I ache my bones
At the end I take home
My hard earned pay all on my own

I get down on my knees and I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

Can anybody find me

He works hard, everyday I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Got no common sense, got nobody left to believe in

But I love you by yourself.

Starless eyes for heaven's sake, but I hear you anyway

Someday, this day, set the ferris wheel ablaze

My Chemical Romance,"Well it rains and it pours when you're out on your own
If I crash on the couch, can I sleep in my clothes?
'Cause I spent the night dancing, I'm drunk I suppose
If it looks like I'm laughing I'm really just asking to leave

This alone You're in time for the show
You're the one that I need, I'm the one that you loathe
You can watch me corrode like a beast in repose
Cause I love all the poison away with the boys in the band

I've really been on a bender and it shows
So why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes?

Give me a shot to remember
And you can take all the pain away from me
A kiss and I will surrender

A light to burn all the empires
So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
In love with all of these vampires
So you can leave like the sane abandon me

You can take off your skin in the cannibal glow
Juliet loves a beat and the lust it commands
Drop the dagger and lather the blood on your hands, Romeo

Selling postcards
Of the hanging
They're painting
The passports brown
The beauty parlor
Is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes
The blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied
To the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad
They're restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady
And I look out tonight
From Desolation Row

Cinderella
She seems so easy
""It takes one to know one""
She smiles
And puts her hands
In her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo
He's moaning
""You Belong to Me I Believe""
And someone says
""You're in the wrong place
My friend
You better leave""
And the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row

Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortunetelling lady
Has even taken
All her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan
He's dressing
He's getting ready
For the show
He's going
To the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row

Now Ophelia
She's 'neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid

To her death
Is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession's her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes
Are fixed upon
Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row

Einstein
Disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend
A jealous monk
He looked
So immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off
Sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
Now you
Would not think
To look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing
The electric violin
On Desolation Row

Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They're trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She's in charge
Of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps
The cards that read
""Have Mercy on His Soul""
They all play
On penny whistles
You can hear them blow
If you lean
Your head out far enough
From Desolation Row

Across the street
They've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready
For the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
A perfect image of a priest
They're spoon feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him
With self-confidence
After poisoning him with words

And the Phantom's
Shouting to skinny girls
""Get Outta Here
If You Don't Know
Casanova is just being
Punished for going
To Desolation Row""

Now at midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see
That nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row

Praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
And everybody's shouting
""Which Side Are You On?""
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row

(About the time the door knob broke)
When you asked how I was doing
Was that some kind of joke?

She'll probably leave me, for some college fool
And I know, that's just the way it goes

In funny old place under the street light
Face to face, here on our last night
You should know, one thing before you go

I tell her, we've gone too far to give up now
And like a bomb, it all comes out (I like the way that..)
She looks at me like nobody else, like nobody's ever done
She makes me feel like nobody else, like nobody's ever done

By the twenty-seventh she's been gone for weeks
I'm terrified she won't remember me
And I know, that's just the way it goes

I stare at her picture, stuck up on the fridge
Face to face with the one I miss
I'm alone, and reaching for the phone

To tell her, we've gone too far to give up now
And like a bomb, it all comes out (I like the way that..)

When you’re rolling stoned

In our own oasis in the desert sand
We’ll celebrate a beautiful romance
When we’re together nothing good goes wrong
We can stay forever
We can just move on

Don’t need a road map to follow

Riding all night
Rolling stoned
A little too high
But never too low
Riding all night

'Cause we’ll cover our tracks
We’ll just keep on driving
And we’ll never look back

One step over the edge

But never too low

And even though life is closing your tiny eyes

But no.  Not mine.  Not now.  My life now begins

When Rosey left for wood
The fire was low just barely a glow
When Rosey left for wood

A farmyard, brook and lane
A pleasant scene, Naïve theme
With wheat and hay and grain

No figures old or young
The artist did include
But now upon that landscape fair
A woman rough and crude

Each day the image differed
The woman here and there
Then close like a portrait
It was Rosey standing there

I thought to make my wife
On getting home, the picture red
‘Twas Rosey with a knife!

The rocks above the lake
And to my sin I pushed her in
The smile on Rosey’s face
Days did pass and I grew old
But Rosey looked the same
My bones were stiff, and hair was grey
But Rosey looked the same

Upon the bed and almost dead
She looked down on me
From the tapestry threads her hand did reach
My spirit now set free

And were sorry to see me pale

We get by thanks to patience; just a little disappointed.
Far from dumb; more blessed than some; boil the water; your turn to cook.
Wide awake; piece of cake; we're sorry neighbors.
Spread it around; get the word out how you got the best of me.
It's no easy task, I'll give you that, but I know when the joke's on me.
Thanks for the excuse, for all the abuse; you're just what I always needed.
A scapegoat for yours truly to call his very own.
In comes the sun, day begun, whether I want it to or not.
I tried to run off, bury the past, leave it behind, but I got caught.
The little voice you got that won't stop egging me on.

I've done things out of desperation, become gainfully employed,
And I took this voice for granted; now it's nearly destroyed.
But at least I've got a new bed to just lie on and fade.
Maybe it's me who's stupid, here, for everything I've said.",Day Begun
My Friend Steve,"Your strange fascination with the obvious
Makes you as startling as a window.
Your keen sense of being oblivious
Shows that you've nothing to hide.
From what I became, to what I'll become,
To what I once was, having seen some.
I went over the salt that's combined between us.
From up there all you see is clouds.
That might be bad.
Nothing like bliss.
After the aging's done, wonder how much I'd miss?
To live beyond the ever lessening mercies of others.
The shoulders that look our way; they scream out; try solitude.

The piss whores in the newsroom
Got a knack for starting fires.
They'll cut out your heart with a chainsaw
And shit it out over the wires.
That might be bad.
Nothing like bliss.
After the aging's done, wonder how much I'd miss?

To live beyond the ever lessening mercies of others.
The shoulders that look our way; they scream out; try solitude.
When the helping hands reach out, and take hold of the pillow that smothers.
Heaven help us all who understand.

My Friend Steve,"What do you see when all that surrounds you is darkness?
Where do you stand when all of your idols have fallen?
I can watch for a little while longer though it pains me
I know this is what the schooling's for
I fall behind sometimes
We pray for an ounce of the architecture
To sink in - a waste of time, sweet time 
Why does this hand that beats me down lay trembling?
Words so unkind they send me into slavery
This fear that keeps me down is raging

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Wake up to the trucks outside my door,

In her hand a silver spoon,

My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult,"It was raining when I woke up this morning 
So to escape I... I went back to bed 
But then the rain started leaking through the ceiling 
And pretty soon it was pouring on my head 

Sometimes it follows you home 
Like an old stray dog 
It won't leave you alone 

But It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Depending on grace 
It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Don't sleep it all away 

So I jumped into my car and hit the freeway 
Found a sunny spot so I could work on my tan 
But just as soon as I stepped one foot in the ocean 
From out of nowhere it came pouring down again 

Sometimes it rains 
All over your parade 
It's like you're reaching for the sun, 
And you're landing in the shade 

But It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Depending on grace 
It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Don't sleep it all away 

Well the moral of the story is 
Sometimes life takes so much more than it gives 
But the One who makes the air I breathe 
Is the One who'll fix the ceiling when it starts to leak 
It may look like the end but it's only the beginning 

It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Depending on grace 
It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Don't sleep it all away

Cause It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Depending on grace 
It's not the end 
The end of the world 
It's just another day 
Don't sleep it all away

It's not the end, it's not the end, 
Still not the end, it's not the end, 
I betcha wonder when this song is gonna end
But it's not the end 'cause I'm singing this song 
And I get to decide when it's the end
And it's not the end , well it's altmost the end, 
Guess you could say it's nearing the end
But it's not the end, it's not the end,

Totally unscarred
Serves protection for my head
But I don't believe everything I read

One that makes them warm
Don't ever lose any of your god-given charm
They believe you were sweet
But you could never pull that one on me

'Cause I still recall in no time at all
You went from being so out of control
To snuffing out the rock that beats

That's why I thought this was so neat
Someplace to go where I felt so all-at-ease
No need to write, no need to call
There's no one to see, there's no you, no me
No need to be anything at all

Fills up beside the clothes
In my dresser drawers
Wish I was quicker on the draw

My Morning Jacket,"He was leading us through the dark.
He was saying that ""love goes on.""
I was wanting some ""ice cream.""
He knew exactly what I meant.

From the drivers seat in the dark
He popped a tape in the dash of his car.
And when the singers started to scream
I knew exactly what he meant.

I never knew for sure
What a wonderful man he was.
What a sensible man he was.
What a marvelous man he was.

Why do we love what is wrong?
Big devil told us to sing along.
And like a loving flock we obey.
Except for him

Forget about instinct
It's not what pays.
Pleasure - up and down my smile:
A carton of eggs think
It's all worthwhile
Tell me spirit - what has not been done?
I'll rush out and do it
Or are we doing it now?

Fissure is the thrill of the day
Forget about feeling
That's not what pays
But you know - all of this can change
Remember the promise as a kid you made

We are the innovators
They are the imitators
Come on - hey, don't you know how we started
We forget about love
But weren't brokenhearted",Wordless Chorus

When your hands close tight around my neck
And force the air that I breathe

I don't wanna feel a thing

Yes, she was a young girl, 'bout the age of 23
But somehow the Lord never smiled down upon her
So she flew out on a breeze

Said, I don't wanna feel a thing
I don't wanna feel a thing

I'm sure he was a good kid
But his phone it'd never ring
He got tired of walkin' a tightrope
Needin' too much to drink, so he got on a knee

I don't wanna feel a thing

Wants to fix you a dream

Wanna sit down and think
Wanna pour you a drink

You won't feel a thing

My Ruin,"I think I'll cut myself
Cut myself free
Now I'm somewhere else
I need to be
Wasted with no sleep 
Forgot to pray Jesus
Can you hear me?
Nails keep pounding
You push your fingers into holes
Of what my questions left
And as I drown your mouth in red
You fear what I will ask next
I violate your faith 
And wonder what you really taste like
Feel the sensation of depth 
I lied

Can't help me now 
It's under my skin
Nowhere to go 
But I can't give in
Can't help me now 
I'm bleeding within
Nowhere to go
I'll never let you in 
I have a fear of dying
I could 
I could worship you

Make you behave
I'd tell 
Tell you anything
Just to be saved 
Baby, how's your faith these days
Do you feel safe? 
Kiss me 
Sunlight makes us sick
As nails keep pounding
You warp your legs around my mind
Ten times and hide in me
The darker that it gets outside
Your heats a 1000 degrees
I make you swallow spit
You're sick with it 
You're sick from me 
Don't say I didn't warn you
I tried

Can't help me now
It's under my skin
Nowhere to run
But I won't give in
Can't help me now
I'm bleeding within
Nowhere to go
I'll never ever give in

What god created us? (your god)

My Ruin,"I invoke Him, and He comes to me, in my dreams
Dressed in black
He speaks in a language only I can understand
His hands are warm, His breath is hot
He is the horrible pain, within my heart
My religion, My sanctuary, My church, My sacrifice, My Confession
My exorcism, My worship, in progress
I have no other lover... now, until forever
He is magic, and when He kisses me, I can taste Him on my lips
Like an elixir
Far from innocent
He is pure evil
A sinners prayer, a saints desire
For Him, I would walk through fire
For Him... I have walked through fire

To draw Him, I want so bad
One gift, I'll never have
He drives a stake into my soul
Makes me bleed, makes me whole
Drinks me, devours me, intoxicates me
With His love, Hate, Devotion, Faith
As beautiful as Jesus Christ
He is as brutal, as the depths of Hell
In my dreams, I press my mouth against His
And I feel Heaven... Horror... Terror
He looks at me with that look
I call it His serial killer look
Like He wants to fuck me, and kill me all at the same time
It scares me
It turns me on
His eyes are brown
His stare is intense... Meaningful, Powerful
Maybe that's why He's so fuckin' scary
Because He means it
Sometimes He tells me He loves me, as He looks at me
With that look
Sometimes He doesn't have to
I've never felt a man look at me like this
It's almost creepy....
Uncomfortable....
Sexy
I guess I know He could never really chop off my hands

........

Or could He?

On that faithful day in Italy Mr be ?
I can hear you singing face on fire blue skies

I know you miss me can't resist me call me Miss B

I can't forget June 10th
I remember when we first met
Do you remember or do you forget?

You were so perfect, so pure like an angel
You were like an angel, amen
And I remember thinking,
I remember thinking

My God my God he is just so beautiful,
So fuckin amazing and every night I would watch you,
I would watch you watching me and we swore that nothing would come between us
That none will come between us do you remember?

Laying down in the middle of the street in the middle of the night
In the centre of you I was humbled by your power,
On the ninth plane

Somewhere in hell digging the hell out of you, digging the hell in you
My co conspirator, my executioner, my sacrificial lamb,
My friend, my lover, my martyr are you my enemy now?

I've been put upon this Earth in female form, 
But I can handle myself from the best of you.
As well as the worst
And I often have
I have the right to remain silent, but I choose to speak, sing, scream.
I have lips hips tits
I am the power of a woman, strong like music, true like friendship, but without my friends, there would be no music, only spoken words.

The world you perceive to be so normal
I am deformed, scorned, reborn
I am me and I know exactly who I am, what I am and the wrath that I bring
The ugly beauty
The lying truth
The virgin whore
The quiet storm

I have decorated myself with love, hate, truth, you, all of you, both of you, none of you, more than one of you. 

Fucker!

With lips like sugar, eyes like meat, I've watched men come, go, cheat
I sleep to dream and dream of sleep
I had a dream Joe, that you were standing in the middle of an open road
I had a dream Joe that your hands were raised up to the sky and your mouth was covered in foam
I have been crucified, justified and mortified by my behavior
Both feminine and masculine
I'm a contradiction a juxtaposition
My release is my relief and only time will tell
All's well that ends well
I am unsweetened unclean, been called drama queen
Ex girlfriend ex-member
The tantrum the temper
I point my finger, take the blame
And this time I will only name
Because nobody is going to ruin me
If I have to, I will ruin myself

My Ruin,"I found him on a night of fire and noise
Wild bells rang in a wild sky
I knew from that moment on
I'd love him till the day that I died
And I kissed away a thousand tears
My lady of the various sorrows
Some begged
Some borrowed
Some stolen
Some kept safe for tomorrow
On an endless night
Silver star spangled
The bells from the chapel went jingle jangle
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me like I love you?
He was given to me to put things right
And I stacked all my accomplishments beside him
Still I seemed so obselete and small
I found god and all his devils inside him
In my bed he cast the blizzard out
A mock sun blazed upon his head
So completely filled with light he was
His shadow fanged and hairy and mad
Our love-lines grew hopelessly tangled
And the bells from the chapel went jingle jangle
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me like I love you?
He had a heartful of love and devotion
He had a mindful of tyranny and terror
Well I try
I do
I really try
But I just err baby
I do
I error
So come find me
My darling one
I'm down to the grounds
The very dregs
Ah here he comes
Blocking the sun
Blood running down the inside of his legs
The moon in the sky is battered and mangled
And the bells from the chapel go jingle jangle
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me like I love you?
All things move toward their end
I knew before I met him that I would lose him
I swear I made every effort to be good to him
I made every effort not to abuse him
Tattoos from his wrists to his ankles
And the bells from the chapel go jingle jangle
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me like I love you?

Something was SUFFOCATING me...couldn't breath
Had no idea that you would ever DECEIVE

CHRIST LIKE IMAGES OF TRUTH...they straight got me

Asked me to TRUST you and yes I TRIED to

Tried to MEDICATE MY HATE with YOUR MAGIC
How could something so SWEET end up so tragic
RESSURECT me from this abyss
IN DEATH EVERY BODY FUNCTION FAILS TO EXIST
False commitments TONGUES twisted with RELIGION
A HEART SHAPED ROCK of the same size incision
OBSOLETE
With no RELIEF or RELEASE
Just INSOMNIA filled nights
Of never ending...SLEEP

Inside a house where no one wants to be

Beyond a doubt but who wants to see

How it might be without no sympathy
Go ahead and worry about

About it you can't even step one foot

And when you finally sink a little more
You'll be there for her and you'll finally hit the floor

Mya,"Yesterday, was not just another day
Not like before
Yesterday, I saw your smilin' face
Love walked through, my door

One precious moment changed my life
One tender kiss made everything right
One touch from you and this world was mine
It was in your arms where I found forever

Cried my first tears of joy, last night
Heaven shined a light
All my dreams came true
My first night with you

I felt the sun shine so bright on me
I chased the rain from my heart
Through the storm, through the darkest night
I found my brightest star

One magic moment made one magic night
I fell in love with one look in your eyes baby
I never knew I could feel so loved
Darling, in your arms I could feel forever

Cried my first tears of joy, last night
Heaven shined a light
All my dreams came true
My first night with you, oh yeah

One touch from you and this world was mine
It was in your arms babe where I found forever and ever

Cried my first tears of joy, last night
Heaven shined a light
All my dreams came true
My first night with you

",My First Night With You [Ric Wake Version]
Mya,"[Chorus] 
Baby it's yours 
No one does it better 
Baby it's yours 
Make it last forever 
You know that it's yours 
Long as were together 
Baby you can rest assure 
It's yours  it's yours 

I never thought it would happen to me 
I never thought I would feel this way 
But you kissed me and suddenly 
Now I'm going crazy 

(going insane out my mind) 
You're all I'm thinking of 
There's nobody in the world 
Who means as much 

(the only one that I adore) 
There's no getting over 
What's in your mind 

[Chorus] 

I never thought that you would be mine 
I never thought that we'd be cool 
But since you came into my life 
I only think about you 

(baby it's true all the time) 
Can't get you off my mind 
The only place I want to be is by your side 
(you're everything I dream and more) 

The one I adore 
So what I'm saying, it's yours 

[Chorus] 

Who is on your mind 
When it's late at night 
When you're in your bed 
And it's your time 

Don't try to deny 
I know you're thinking about me all the time 
Baby boo, I'm hooked on you 
And I know I got you feeling it 

(feeling it) 
All I'm looking for one that I adore 
So baby it's yours

(I just want to get what's left of you, ha)
Can't let you get, oh no (Yo, yo)

He has a little game that he plays
Clever little ways and a hot boy style
Brags about the dough that he makes
Flash a little cash most girls wild out
Lately he's been checking for me
Telling me how much he wants to be
Wants to be the one to replace
Replace the man that waits at home for me

But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
Then you put it on me
Feelings coming on strong
I know that it's wrong
I can't let you get the best of me

(You put it on me)
The best of me
(You put it on me)

So busy trying to play with my head
Telling me how he could blow my mind
Something about the things that he said
Made me want to take it there one time
I should be walking away
Cause his hands up on my thigh
Should I leave, should I stay?
After all it's just one night

But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes

That they won't fit in the bank
And I'm a do this just like Tony did it to Frank
But I'm a make sure both y'all win

Let him keep the place you move
And I'm a pay both y'all rent
So forget about the condo and come to the crib
'Cause the castle over the mountain come with a bridge

You know literally we can go shopping in Italy
Hand on her thigh she don't want to get rid of me
And she don't drink or know how a L look
Chanel look mixed with the Pete Arnell look

You just stay pretty while I'm running the city
When I whip the V you can hold the joint if you with me
Vacation cost a hundred and fifty we living it up
I put it on your ass if you giving up

And you know I'm not a hater
And if you feel bad then you can call him later
And tell him you all Jada's

Oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
Then you put it on me
You ain't gonna get to me
You can't get the best of me

The surpreme dream team, always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to sellin raps, name your theme

Who the hell want to stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top divas
Diplomatic immunity, no time for a Visa
And just because, I'ma shoot them one by one
Got five sides to me, somethin like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Lettin bygone be bygone, and so on, and so on
I'ma teach this cat, how to live in the ghetto
Keepin it retro-spective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo

Behind closed doors hittin truth to the seafloor

While the kids are poor, open more and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal EVERYTHING, change the law
I find myself, walkin the streets
Tryin to find what's really goin on in the streets

Yea, yo, yo, yo
Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, dance around these fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater and make you do a pas de bourre
Kick your balls like Pele, pick em doin ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, crowd yellin !Ole!

Wonderin what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hangin out
partyin with girls that never die, the C.O.'s

Well in my mind love's the very same way 
That's why I never give my heart to no one 

I never take a chance 
On a love that lifts me off the ground 
Oh yeah (oh yeah) 
I came to Earth found things 
But I want to spread my wings somehow  somehow 

I've got a fear of flying high 
But I'm prepare to spread my wings 
And it's all in my mind 
Love defies all gravity 

Voices in the wind 
I can hear them welcome me to fly 
Think I'm flying now, flying now, flying now 

Listen 
I've been in love but I fell to fast 
I found myself in turbulent skies 
I felt the hurt when I crashed and burned 
Then I found myself with tears in my eyes 

But when you look at me 
Something says it's gonna be alright, alright 
And all my fears I'll face 
'Cause I think I'm gonna take this flight, oh 

I've got a fear of flying high 
But I'm prepare to spread my wings 
And it's all in my mind 
Love defies all gravity 

Voices in the wind 
I can hear them welcome me to fly 
Think I'm flying now, flying now, flying now 

Ooh suddenly, suddenly 
The other clouds is calling me 
And you're love to me is like therapy 
For my soul, so I'm ready to soar 

Fear of flying high 
Spread my wings 
And it's all in my mind 
Love defies all gravity 

Voices in the wind 
I can hear them welcome me 
Think I'm flying now, flying now, flying now 

Think I'm flying 
Think I'm, think I'm... 

Think I'm flying 
Think I'm, think I'm... 

Fear of flying high 
It's all in my mind 
Voices in the wind 
Think I'm flying now, flying now, flying now 

Fear of flying high 
It's all in my mind 
Voices in the wind 
Think I'm flying now, flying now, flying now",Fear of Flying
Mya,"October 10
Here I am again
Back where I started from
And just when I let myself fall deep, fall hard
It seems every time I give my all
I turn around only to get slapped 
In the face with rejection
Now see this is the type of stuff 
That makes me just wanna stop
Just stop it all
Stop the giving to avoid the taking
Stop loving to avoid the hating
Stop trusting to avoid all these lies
But most of all
Stop flying to avoid the fall

When we first met up on the stairway 
You were so fly you made my shy away 
But unfortunately I pretended that I could not stay 
And now 

I don't know what's just come over me but suddenly 
I've got the urge to feel your body soakin' wet right next to me 
I can't explain why I'm feeling for you so bad 
But maybe we'll find out 
Tonight for the first time 
(For the first time) 

So now you're here but I don't know what to do 
'Cause it's been so long since we both me and you 
Have talked have kissed 
But there's only one person on this earth 
I know that I've missed 

I don't know what's just come over me but suddenly 
I've got the urge to feel your body soakin' wet right next to me 
I can't explain why I'm feeling for you so bad 
But maybe we'll find out 

Tonight for the first time 
(For the first time) 

Now I know I've always wanted you 
Was too afraid to make a move 
Ashamed to let all of my feelings show 
And when I heard you were coming to town 

I hoped that you would come around 
I got some things to say that you should know 
But I don't know what's just come over me 
But suddenly I've got the urge your body 

Your body, body right next to me 
I can't explain why I'm feeling 
But maybe we'll find out tonight for the first time

This is for all of ya'll out there 
That ever dealt with somebody 
(pump this in ya jeeps)
Who be lyin', fakin', cheatin', stealin, creepin', BSn'
(pump this in ya jeeps)
I got this thing called the lie detector
Two teaspoons and they bound to tell the truth
(pump this in ya jeeps)
Listen

[VERSE 1:]
You told me (you told me)
That I was your fantasy yeah (its yours)
You said that
We would practice monogamy

So, I became a freak under the sheets
Put his ass to sleep
Creeped into the kitchen
And got the remedy
Its called the lie detector
Slipped it in his drink
Brought it to his bedside and said ""take a sip of this and don't peek""

[CHORUS 1:]
You won't believe what happened when he sipped  the lie detector
Looked into his eyes 
Asked him where you been
He said ""its no surprise cause I been with my ex-girl""
Why didn't you tell me the truth
He said ""you don't want to hear the truth""

Sometimes I wish I never gave him lie detector
I thought he loved me but he loved her
So I'm kinda glad he took the lie detector
Now I know the truth so you can get the boot

[CHORUS 2:]
You won't believe what happened when he gave her the lie detector
Looked at her pager number
Said who's ?? sixty-nine
She said don't be surprised cause its ?? your best friend
He looked and swallowed his pride frontin' like
Tough guys don't cry

Sometimes he wish he never gave her lie detector
But thought she loved him but she loved his best friend
But now he's kinda glad she took the lie detector
Found out the truth so he gave her the boot

There's no tears on my pillow 
No room for crying 
No tears on my pillow

I trust in my heart 
I know what I want 
And it tears you apart 

Don't worry about me 
Thinking of you 
My days are filled 
With too much to do 

The whole world is waiting 
For me to explore 
I can't waste my time on you anymore

No regrets, no sadness 
You're not the first and you're not the last man

Mya,"I've tried so hard to make you understand
That it's over, yes it's over

Why can't you let it go
I'm not yours anymore
I want you to know
Tried so hard to explain
But it seems from your presence
That it's all in vain
Say good bye, let it go
Say you wanna come back
But I don't wanna know, wanna know, baby

[Chorus]
Again and again and again and again and
Again and again
You come back to me boy
You come back to me boy
Again and again and again and again and
Again and again
You come back to me boy
But you don't hear me no

Leave me the ... alone
Don't make me change my number
Don't' make me change my home
Believe me when I say
You need some help from someone
But that someone ain't me
'Cause you wanna be the man,
That keeps knocking on my door
No, it's not OK
'Cause you keep running in and
Running out of my heart

[Chorus]

I tried to, to want you,
But you don't hear me no
Again & again you keep coming around
When all you wanna do is let me down
I don't feel you no more
But you still callin' me boy
Why can't you see
That you're wastin' my time?
It's over with, you're out of my life
You need some help from someone
Now leave me, leave me the hell alone

He think he slick ain't doing right 
But now he's got to go

Say yes without the pressures 
Cause boy I'm ready to

Now I know that you want me 
Just as much as I want you 
You ain't got to lie, you ain't go to front 
So why don't ya tell the truth? 
As of now we send the past 
Not enough time for being sad 
I'm a sexy shaker, girl move on 
And don't you move to fast 

See you know how the game is played 
If it was you, you'd put her through the same thing 
Are you with that it is wrong? 
Now can we please get it on? 
You're the only that knows can we get down now

Mya,"When we first met I told myself you were the one
To lay up next to me
Late at night when work was done
You looked into me eyes
How could somethin' so right be wrong?
I gotta find a way to leave him for you

So I start a fight
To get him mad at me
Then we'll be breakin' up, temporarily
That's when I'm callin' you
To head over your house
Baby I love the way you take care of me when you see me down
I love it when you're tellin' me

Hurry up, come quick, I'll be waitin' for you
I gotta find a way to leave him for you

Uh uh uh, uh, hurry up

When I lay down at night
Why the hell are you on my mind?
When I'm up next to him?
Maybe ?'cause he don't treat me right
You could be lovin' me
I know he does his thing on the side
Gotta find me a good reason to leave

To get him mad at me

And all the friends I've had
Never ever thought that I would change
But as I'm lookin' back 
Feels like I'm growin' up so damn fast 
Before I know it my futures now my past
Like sand through an hour glass

[Chorus]
I want to take a picture so I remember this moment forever
I want to take a picture so I remember this moment together 

Sittin' here thinkin' of my yesterdays
Things weren't this crazy
I wasn't so emotional
I didn't cry at commercials 
Sometimes I feel like a mess
And people laugh at how I dress
And sometimes I act like an ass
And watch sand through an hour glass

I want to take a picture so I remember this moment forever
I want to take a picture so I remember this moment together
I want to take a picture so I can remember this moment forever

Mya,"I'm tired of this shit
I'm tired of these silly ass games
I can't even look at you no more
And I don't think you'll ever understand
Until you get a dose of your own
It's your turn now

Crazy how I never use to say a single word
I just held in all the hurt, all this hurt
And I was so afraid you might flip out
And leave me in the cold
Then my mind ran out of space
So many stories I'm told

How would you feel
If I put my girls before the one I love
How would it feel
If every time you want to talk
I turn the TV on
How would you feel
If when we're making love
I don't go down no more
So you know how I feel
Get ready cause a 3-6-0's about to go down

Taste this
And let's see if you can handle it
Just one sip
You probably choke on your own medicine
Taste that
Once you swallow then I got you trapped

No more running
No more hiding
And if you try
I'm still gon find ya
And get you back
Get you back

Listenin' to my conversations
On the other phone
Got somebody followin' me
When I leave out our home
And I am so appalled
You take it there
When you're the one who messed up
It's like I'm sleepin' with the enemy

How would you like it
If your girlfriend started playin' F.B.I
And she was the one
You forgave when she messed up
And spread her thighs
Plays with his brain
Started foolin' with ya money
Your house
Your Bens
Your friends
Your work
Let's see how you like it
And take a little taste
Taste of your own dirt

You probably choke on your own medicine

I've got to find a remedy
I'm sleeping with the enemy (Yeah)
He doesn't know just what's in store
So they call me a silent storm
And soon he'll feel all my of pain
I'll come for sun after the rain (Oh)
ain't nothin' sweeter than revenge
To put this bullshit to an end
Let's see what happens when I get a Lex
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Lets see what happens if I quit my job
Oh
Let's see how you feel when I don't call back
You can't take it

No more running
No more hiding
Cause I'm crazy
I'm a find you
And get you back

You not a man
If I gotta tell you how to treat me (Oh)
And I'm not a woman
If I don't stand up in what I believe in

But less than 25 is what you gave me

No more running
No more hiding (Yep)

I'm still goin' find ya (See, I'm a find you)
And get you back

You hurt me
You hurt me so bad

Yesterday was not a good day

Told me someone was messin' with my mind
Said you gotta get out the situation girl

So how could all this be?
Throw me in the penitentiary, before there's tragedy
I never saw it coming, hit me at full speed
And severed all of my trust and bruised me internally

Girl get out, make it fast
Hit the road, here's some cash
Say you want to be a star
Live the life, fancy cars

Feelings change, people change
Things never stay the same

Use up my toilet paper, eat all my Applejacks
You so-call 'borrow' my clothes
I never get them back
I don't quite understand how you can sit in my house on your ass
Got ends to get your hair done but can't buy your own grass
Oh girl

Whatchya need's to find a job
Helped you out, it's gone too far
Girl you're crowdin' my space
Whatchya need's to find a place

Feelings change, people change
Things never stay the same

I come home from work early only for me to find
My best friend sitting on top of something I call mine!
Thought my eyes were playin' tricks on me
But how could all this be?
But to my surprise it was no dream
It's my reality

Trick get out, give back the car
You've taken this, slightly far
Had your hands in my life
Til I saw that you was trife

Feelings change, People change
Things never stay the same

I feel so ignorant, he had me on birth control
We stopped using protection a long, long time ago
Then I witnessed him sexin' my best friend, aka Dirty Hoe!
In the morning I'll be at the doctor's office
I'm curious to know how long this has been goin' on

Nig' get out, the tank is full
No second chance, you broke the rules
Bet' not come around no more
You've proved your point, you're such a whore!

Feelings change, People change
Things never stay the same

I let my feelings go too far and in my way

Said somethin' was wrong with my head
Told me someone was messin' with my mind
Said you gotta get out the situation girl
It's only a matter of time

Mya,"Let me let y'all know something bout me man
(slim thugga motherfucker)

I do this for the block I do this for the hood
I do this for the streets keep me good
I do it for the hustler cause I do it for the thugs
I do it for the G's cause the G's show me love
I came in the game 17 real loud only thing
On ma mind make my mama proud
Started rockin' crowds gettin' dough for show's
And as the fame rolls den came the hoes
Den came the cloths den came the cars
Next thing I know I'ma ghetto superstar
He come the haters travelin' by the packs
But never mind them cause uh bitch I'm back

I pour up a cup fill the swisha with good and fire it up 
So I can gather ma thoughts
(lets get high) Mo money mo problems
They say that's how it is when you live like a boss.
(like a boss) You see I've been goin' on ma grind
For sometimes and the streets thought a nigga fell off
(hell no nigga) But if I decide to rhyme no mo rhymes
I'ma still be well off
(cause bitch I'm back)

A born boss got nothin' to loose
Still shinin' in the game got nothin' to prove
Got rich and independent didn't need no deal
Had paper before I signed didn't need no meal
Got hustles on the side ain't got to rep
And if all else fails I still got the trap
I don't fuck wit you rappers
Y'all fake to me
I don't fuck wit y'all majors y'all snakes to me
I don't care about fame fuck bein' a star
Let them take all the pictures just gimme his car
Den gimme his house and his watch and chain
On the bank account, credit cards jock ma name (Thugga)
But I guess one come wit the other
So here I go I'ma writin' rap hustler
I'm too blessed to complain about that
So where I gotta sign? take ya pictures cause bitch I'm back

I pour up a cup fill the swisha with good and fire it up 
So I can gather ma thoughts
(lets get high) Mo money mo problems
They say that's how it is when you live like a boss.

For sometimes and the streets thought a nigga fell off
(hell no nigga) But if I decide to rhyme no mo rhymes
I'ma still be well off.
(cause bitch I'm back)

They say stay true for hits no, fuck it
I'ma gone keep it one-hundred fo the public (that's right)
I dropped all ready platinum but they only sell gold
And niggas lookin' at me like I sold ma soul
Cause I'm rappin' wit P and not mister Lee
But when ya on ya grind sometimes ya can't see
Before Mike Camo Paul the sign
I was at anascope can't find ma mind
Still dippin' wooden poppin' 3 kings just droppin'
And I'm an underground artist tryna get on top
So I listen to ma label, plan to break X and learned a whole lot a game from that.
Just stay true ma nigga and do you
And fuck what another try to tell you to do
They'll tell you to spit backs they can bump in them lexis
And oh yeah this a train track. bitch im back

Verse
Baby,I know you think I play games
With your heart when I hold back.
It doesn't mean that I don't want you
It's just I'm alittle selfish,and I don't like to share

I know you be thinking sometimes I be
Brushing you off that I got another man
But boy that's not the case
I'm so damn attracted to you,but I want to
Do it right,so I fight the feelings cus I'm worth
The wait.Your bodies playing like crazy
Your swagger got me like damn,
So gangsta but grown and sexy
Everything I want in a man.

You make a chick want to take it off
And give it to you right now,but I gotta know
Wuts up,before we cut,and that's wus up 
Because I wanna be

(Chorus) 
The only one, the only one
'not yo main chick,not yo main chick'
The only one,the only one
So sexy,but can you handle it,
So much love that I got in store,
Places you ain't been before,I'll give you mine
If you give me yours,open all leave
Behind closed doors,I gotta be 
The only one,the only one

Verse 2
Now here we are,all alone in this empty room
And it's getting real crazy,against the wall
Got me bent up,I'm bout to fuck up,
So stop wait a minute baby
I already know you got a lot of woman in your life
(cus you so fly)
And I don't want to get hurt

You make a chick wanna take it off
And give it to you right now,
I wanna get to know you better
But I let it go because I wanna be

(Chorus)
The only one,the only one
'not yo main chick,not yo main chick'
The only one,the only one
Sexy chick,but can you handle it
So much love that I got in store,
Places you ain't been before,I'll give you mine
If you give me yours,open all leave 
Behind closed doors,cus I gotta be
""the only one,the only one""

(Bridge x2)
I'll be waitin for ya, I'll be waitin
Hope ya waitin for me,hope ya waitin


I really don't need to tell you 
You already know you fine
It ain't one girl in this world
Who would'nt stand in line
So I'm gon' test my patience
Let you enjoy yo fame and
When you done wit dem hoes
And wanna roll wit a real chick
She right here waitin...

No doubt I puts in down,but boy
You just not ready yet.What chick you 
Know drive a stick, sick in the kitchen
And look like this.So if your serious,
Serious about loveing me
This ain't no hit and run I gotta be The only one.

Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on

And guess who sighs a lullaby
To nights that never end?

Mmm the summer wind

Mygrain,"Define my conscience, what is real
Characterize the ways world disappears
I try but I can't decide from reality and fantasy

Glittering darkness room by room
Nothing satisfies as I enter bloom
Fear my world so puzzled and mystified
Stage of pleasure and pain is what I hide behind my eyes

My inability to feel real
Hyper reality feeds me
Falling into my secret window
As I walk the earth unhallowed

Anything, everything
Tricking, conscience what I've seen
Detached from engagement of emotions
Meaningless identical devotions
Rapidly taking any given shape
Filtered experience depicted in hate

Your demons, my angels
Capsized parallel dream world
Parting ways to breathe to be alive
Crusade of perfect stranger
Disconnect the splendor
Alienations steers till the end

Split apart from a faculty of mind
Non-existent world in a glimpse of an eye
Simulation of something to never exist
This authentic fake, mind misled

Light years away from here
Hyperspace to escape my fear
Simulation of familiar place
Reproduction of empty appearance

My inability to feel real
Hyper reality feeds me
Falling into my secret window
As I walk the earth unhallowed

Your demons, my angels
Capsized parallel dream world
Parting ways to breathe, to be alive
Crusade of perfect stranger
Disconnect the splendor
Alienations steers till the end

Your demons, my angels
Crusade of perfect stranger

So puzzled that I won't wake up
I'm sick of spewing my words out
So puzzled that I won't wake up

",Alienation
Mygrain,"Fear casting this sight with its monumental shadow
Descent to the earth wearing unidentified doom

Freezing sun beyond the curtains of black
No escape from falling past the event horizon
Falling empires fading into the landscape
Shape of the formless mass of attracting everything

Lost inside escape velocity
Falling in particles, fight the lost gravity
Celestial bodies, colliding interstellar clouds
Rendering its dense invisible interiors
Morphing to the darker space phenomena
Sucked into a new era

Inflamed world taking stranger turns
Fight the gravity in trembling imbalance
These polluted shades, pixilated rooftops in flames
I distort my appearance

Drifting to the void with no soul
Smoke the freedom with your ashes
Grasping widespread warning, the day of reckoning
Foredoomed to wander, shaken and stranded
Transparent snow globe world
Imbalanced atmosphere shatters

Subdued to explode, the host of new life
Appearing from these reptile eyes
The scattering of light
Capture my breath as I plunder away

I, the blind visitor, the explorer of empty skies
Tormented lives
Worms to a cosmic storms
I diverge from the form

Reformation evolving to cascade
Purging and taking our thoughts and memories away
Encroaching inside, spreading disease threadbare
Strangler of the universe, take and disperse

Warped minds disconnected, lost in reality
Reprogrammed to forget everything

Hypnotizing circles in the smokescreen
Cycle repeats, rebirth of a different scene
Weakened breath forming a dark nebula
New dawning of a darker era

Dark kinetic energies invade our souls
Oblivion's forming eternal black holes

Drifting to the void with no soul
Smoke the freedom with your ashes
Grasping widespread warning, the day of reckoning
Foredoomed to wander, shaken and stranded
Transparent snow globe world
Imbalanced atmosphere shatters

Mygrain,"Soaked to the skin
Illusions injected and way out rejected
Nothing's for free, so what you wanted to be?
Black ocean emptiness, explore my ignorance
Chew up my dirty flesh, ignorance is a bless

Shining in a dying light
Narcotics in a frantic sight
Take my hand, let's burn together
Rise to another level

Linking into radiant winds and storm
In this bleak reality I've been reborn
Dig under my skin with your claws
Camouflage your flaws

My muted speech sticks like a leech
Complex love turns a mess, a paradoxical happiness
Mirthless divine devouring me raw
Unavoidable disaster turning around my jaw

Shining in a dying light
Narcotics in a frantic sight
Take my hand, let's burn together
Rise to another level

Linking into cosmic winds and storm
Scrounging and emptying every core
Dig under my skin with your claws
Disguise your flaws

Parasite in a fool's paradise
Playing God, now throw the dice
Steering madness completing perfect puzzle
The hand that rocks the cradle

This perfect chaos reforming to reign
It's back never to leave again
Cross the boundaries of dream and true
Forsaken passages to refuel

Connecting into breeding engines
Spewing out inhuman purgings
All memories are left in slumber
No one hears you're going under

Stretching out from minority
Playing God by atrocity
The hand that rocks the lachrymose cradle
This perfect chaos, euphoric and fatal

Parasite in a fool's paradise
Playing God, now throw the dice
Steering madness completing perfect puzzle
The hand that rocks the cradle

This perfect chaos reforming to reign
It's back never to leave again
Cross the boundaries of dream and true
Forsaken passages to refuel

Mygrain,"Bury me down and dig up the hole
Take another step to steal my soul
Drowning control to feed
The flames of translucent dreams

Like a fly reaching to the light
Blinding eyes and drifting out of sight
It's burning you low
When too much is not enough for you

Stars align fractions of eternity
I'm lost in false sense of security
Constellation to holes in the bleeding sky

Spirit emulating creature
Peeling in as something dies
Interweaved to its web, grasping our lives

Bury me down and dig up the hole
Take another step to steal my soul
Drowning control to feed

When too much is not enough for you

Mind tricks behind my eyes
Plugged in to follow my demons in disguise

Stars aligning fragments of the memories
Parallel truth, awaken in translucence
Sealed by this deadened song
Sinking in toneless comatose

Come and tear my skin, fear what's within

Dig in to yourself and bury the bones
Delve inside to drown in oblivion's holes
Come and tear my skin, fear what's within
Explore my every sin and she'd my skin

Bury me down and dig up the hole
Take another step to steal my soul
Drowning control to feed
The flames of translucent dreams

Like a fly reaching to the light
Blinding eyes and drifting out of sight
It's burning you low
When too much is not enough for you

Mind tricks behind my eyes
Plugged in to follow my demons in disguise

Stars aligning fragments of the memories
Parallel truth, awaken in translucence
Sealed by this deadened song
Sinking in toneless comatose

It's massive darkness filling my world
Submerged rage writing unspoken words

Cut the radio off
I'm bumpin' that Johnny Gill
She said Mykko you nasty
I said no I'm just real
She started playin her role
This shit just got too real
I tied up my dreads
Then fell off in her legs
She slowed me down then sat me down
Then started givin' me head

But I'm diggin' all her ways
She 5'2"" and I'm 6'4""

Dancin' on the pole,she playin' with that pussy
Don't shoot me down baby girl I'm like cupid
So she shoved him off that pole
And told me something I should know
The music loud she was talkin' low I couldn't understand this ho
So I told shawty go change clothes and meet me back right here
Don't say a word just grab ya bag so we can disappear
She said bet and I said cool
Later on we was at the twelve
She don't drink lean but she smoke loud
So we burned down the whole hell
See you the type I might take home and let you spend the night
But I don't know yet
It's our first date
Let me think about it a'ight!
So we in the whip on 75 trynna figure out the move
She said aye and I said what
She gone ask me what we gone do
Come lay ya head on my lap and do somethin' you barely don't do
She said bet then she got loose and blew the top off of that coochie

Eyes wide open, can’t sleep
Night is burning, red, red, red, red
Silence is dead
Don’t belong here, you see
Thought life would bring me mystery
Sole mystery
No trace, no face, just misery
Speak up, I know the rain
Speak up, you know the pain
Speak up, speak up

Light me up, light me up
We can never go wrong
Light me up, light me up
I’m so cold, it’s so wrong
Please come to me
Please come to me
I dare, I care

Et la bête passe et chasse
Tout forme de résistance
Si elle menait la danse?

Et d'un tour de clé
Comme un sourd muet
Nul besoin de barreaux de croix
On s'enferme tout seul parfois
Et l'amour, je sais
A portée d'aimer
Les fantômes ne nous laissent en paix
Tyrannie des secrets gardés

À rebours de tout
Du bon sens
S'en fout
Rêver d'enfreindre et
Mettre en terre
Ignorer et tout foutre en l'air
Pour gagner les cimes
Tout simplement vivre
Aux verrous qui semblaient lâcher
Je crains qu'il ne me manque la clé

Et d'un tour de clé
Comme un sourd muet
Nul besoin de barreaux de croix
On s'enferme tout seul parfois
Et l'amour, je sais, est a portée d'aimer
Aidez-moi retrouver mes clés
Il faudra bien
M'apaiser enfin",A  rebours
Mylène Farmer,"Late at night in summer heat
Expensive car in an empty street
There's a wire in my jacket
For this is my trade
It only takes a moment, don't be afraid
I can hotwire an ignition like some kind of star
I'm just a poor boy in a rich man's car

Et le moteur s'allume enfin
Nos vies s'enlacent
And we drive into the night
Oh le cuir doux s'en mêle
Affole ton imagination

Dans une autre situation
Tu es company director

He's alone
Spends the night with his lover

Il y a des traces

Of her cologne

Tous les mots de sa maîtresse
A l'oreille sans détour
Comme une chanson d'amour

Please take me dancing tonight I've been all on my own
Les promesses d'un jour d'un soir, je les entends comme un psaume
I'm just a prisoner of love
Prisonnières de mes failles
Take me dancing, please take me dancing tonight
Please take me dancing tonight
Please take me dancing tonight


Imagine ta femme
Sa vie glisse entre ses doigts
Il y a une règle, être chasseur ou bien la proie
Il lui dira je rentre tard ses affaires partirera

But there's more than a suspicion
In this lingering cologne

Et les enfants feront la tete

And she runs a traffic light
And she drives into the night

Please take me dancing tonight I've been all on my own
Les promesses d'un jour d'un soir, je les entends comme un psaume

Myriam,"Hoy voy a cambiar, revisar bien
Mis maletas y sacar mis sentimientos y
Resentimientos todos

Hacer limpieza al armario
Borrar rencores de antaño
Y angustias que hubo en mi mente

Para no sufrir por cosas tan pequeñitas
Dejar de ser niña para ser mujer
Hoy voy a cambiar
Sacar a la luz mi coraje y entregarme a lo que creo
Y ser siempre yo sin miedos

Bailar y cantar por hábito y ver claro en vez
De oscuro, desarraigar mis secretos, dejar de vivir
Si no es por vivir la vida

Que grita dentro de mí
Mi libertad

Hoy voy a cambiar, salir de dentro de mí
Y no ser sólo corazón
Dejar y parar fracasos, soltar los brazos
Mi libertad que oprime mi razón

Volar libre con todos mis defectos
Para poder rescatar mis derechos
Y no cobrarle a la vida caminos ni decisiones

Hoy quiero y debo cambiar

Dividirle al tiempo y sumarle al viento
Todas las cosas que un día
Soñé conquistar, porque soy mujer
Como cualquiera con dudas y soluciones
Con defectos y virtudes, con amor y desamor

Suave como gaviota pero felina como una leona
Tranquila y pacificadora pero al mismo tiempo
Irreverente y revolucionaria

Feliz e infeliz, realista y soñadora
Sumisa por condición
Más independiente por opinión

Porque soy mujer con todas las
Incoherencias que nacen de mí
Fuerte el sexo débil

Hoy voy a cambiar, revisar bien
Mis maletas y sacar mis sentimientos
Y resentimientos todos

Hacer limpieza al armario
Borrar rencores de antaño
Y angustias que hubo en mi mente

Para no sufrir por cosas tan pequeñitas
Dejar de ser niña para ser mujer

",Mudanzas
Myriam,"Con la paz de las montañas te amaré
Con locura y equilibrio te amaré
Con la rabia de mis años
Como me enseñaste a hacer
Con un grito en carne viva, te amaré

En secreto y en silencio te amaré
Arriesgando en lo prohibido, te amaré
En lo falso y en lo cierto, con el corazón abierto
Por ser algo no perfecto, te amaré

Te amaré, te amaré
Como no está permitido
Te amaré, te amaré
Como nunca se ha sabido
Porque así lo he decidido, te amaré

Por ponerte algún ejemplo te diré
Que aunque tengas manos frías te amaré
Con tu mala ortografía y tu no saber perder
Con defectos y manías, te amaré

Te amaré, te amaré
Porque fuiste algo importante
Te amaré, te amaré
Cuando ya no estés presente
Seguirás siendo costumbre y te amaré

Al caer de cada noche esperaré
A que seas luna llena y te amaré
Y aunque queden pocos restos
En señal de lo que fue
Seguirás cerca y muy dentro, te amaré

Te amaré, te amaré
A golpe de recuerdo
Te amaré, te amaré
Hasta el último momento
A pesar de todo, siempre te amaré

",Te Amaré
Myriam,"Quizás no fue el tiempo
Ni fue el momento
No tiene lógica el argumento
A veces la vida es así

Tan cerca estuvimos alma con alma
Tu piel con mi piel quemó toda la calma

Aún no pudimos concebir
Que el hecho de no actuar
Y no abrazar lo que era nuestro
Fue el error que viviré para siempre

Como sería, que hubiera sido de mí si ese día
No te hubiera dejado partir
Como sería besar tus labios cada amanecer
Poder perderme cada noche tu querer

Como sería por culpa del miedo del abandono
Sinceramente no sabía como
Apostar un beso contra la eternidad
Quizás soy la culpable de este destino

Sé que hoy no haría lo mismo
No te dejaría escapar el hecho de no actuar
Y no abrazar lo que era nuestro fue el error
Que viviré para siempre

",Cómo Sería
Myriam,"Lo que yo soy y logre a fuerza de dolor y de fe
Fue como conquistar montañas
Cuando una mano me alzo sentí que otra evito
Que avanzara pero yo seguí mi marcha

Cuesta arriba así voy por la vida
Contra el viento corriendo tras un sueño
Cuesta arriba cargando mis heridas
Llegando a donde pertenezco

Tratando de vivir y de ser yo
Todo lo que yo sufrí me hizo crecer y ser mas humana
A nadie le gane con trampas en tiempos de decisión
Mi instinto me guió me inspiraba con el pude volar sin alas

Cuesta arriba así voy por la vida
Contra el viento corriendo tras un sueño
Cuesta arriba cargando mis heridas
Llegando a donde pertenezco

Tratando de vivir sin miedo
Tratando siempre de llegar a la meta que me he puesto
Y aunque el camino es largo voy subiendo

Cuesta arriba así voy por la vida
Contra el viento corriendo tras un sueño
Cuesta arriba cargando mis heridas
Llegando a donde pertenezco

Siempre dando el corazón
Tratando de vivir y de ser yo
Tratando de vivir
Tratando de vivir y de ser yo

Has llegado donde te mereces estar
Por tu propio pie y siendo tu
Felicidades

Y todas las voces te hablen de mí

Solo entonces sabrás
Cuanto es lo que perdiste

Porque a pesar del dolor volver a florecer

Jamás imaginaba
Que cederías así tan fácilmente
A su débil corazón

Tendrás tu merecido
Aquí no abra jamás perdón ni olvido
Del castigo no te salvaras

Que se perdió en su mar

Me hiciste tanto daño
Tú me enseñaste a amarlo
y ahora yo no sé olvidar
Ay amor, ay amor
Por qué me dueles tanto
Ay amor, ay amor
Recuérdame

Quererle ahora
No tiene causa ni razón
No tiene voluntad

Levantaré mi vuelo

Por siempre te olvido y exiges mi cariño

De ti ya no es lo mismo

Sólo espero que entiendas que un amor
Se debe de cuidar y no jugar con nadie
Porque yo te daba mi querer
Y aun sin merecer no te dolió dejarme

Ahora vuelves buscando mi calor
Diciendo que jamás lograste olvidarme
Pero yo te aclaro de una vez
Lo debes entender es demasiado tarde

Yo no te guardo rencor pero tampoco amor
De ti ya nada queda
No niego fue mucho mi dolor pero eso ya paso
Mejor ya no nunca vuelvas

Si tu imaginación, ya no te deja respirar
Y prende fuego fuego, fuego, entonces no hay remedio

Ay, ay, ay, ay, permite que te atrape

Si notas que el calor te viene a golpes de tensión
Y pega fuerte fuerte, fuerte, entonces mucha suerte

Veo mi paz que se desprende por doquier
Que después te entrego
Necesito hablar las cosas que yo sé
Y después me niego

Y la verdad es que estoy loca ya por ti
Que tengo miedo de perderte alguna vez
Necesito aceptar que Dios jamás
Va a separarte de mi vida

Es una locura de decir que no te quiero
Evitar las apariencias, ocultando evidencias
Mas porque seguir fingiendo si no puedo engañar mi corazón
Yo sé que te amo

Ya no mas mentiras si me muero de deseos
Yo te quiero más que a todo necesito de tus besos

Mas sin ti no que hacer, que hacer sin ti

 Botar mi corazón sin querer, sin querer.
 No dejaré que uses el amor,
 Que robes lo mejor sin querer, sin querer.

 No quiero escapar, ir lejos de tu amor
 En recuerdo a lo que fue, invento lo que soy
 Ya todo lo raro, tus huellas en mi piel,
 No volveré a sentir que eres parte de mí.

 Que daba la vida sin buscar algo más,
 Soy ala quebrada que aprendió a volar.

 No dejaré que intentes otra vez
 Botar mi corazón sin querer, sin querer.
 No dejaré que uses el amor,
 Que robes lo mejor sin querer, sin querer.

 No dejaré que intentes otra vez...",Sin Querer
Myriam Hernández,"Es amor y duda
Miradas prohibidas
Besos en penumbra
Que sellan el secreto de los dos
Es la noche oscura
El único secreto de este amor
Cómplices del fuego
Que tiene prisionera la razón
Cada despedida
En medio del silencio del adiós
Es como una espina
Clavada que lastima el corazón
Cada nuevo encuentro
Es una fantasía sin final
Juntos descubrimos
Que no existen barreras para amar

Este amor de fuego y de pasión
Es nuestro pecado y tentación
Este amor secreto de los dos
Es nuestra condena y salvación
Este amor de sombras en un bar
De palabras dichas sin hablar
Este amor callado y soñador
Es amor que nubla la razón

Amor, amor, es nuestro amor secreto
Amor, amor, te llevo aquí muy dentro
Amor, amor, es nuestro amor secreto
Amor , amor, te llevo aquí muy dentro

Noches que se pierden
Buscando en los recuerdos tu calor
Besos que no vuelven
Por siempre en los rincones del adiós
No poder tenerte
Es una cruz que debo soportar
Y vivir por verte
Es algo que no sé como evitar

Es amor y dudas
Besos en penumbra
Es la noche oscura
Cómplice de nuestro amor
Este amor de fuego y de pasión
Es nuestro pecado y tentación
Amor secreto
Amor, amor secreto
Esta amor callado
Corazón robado
Es nuestra condena y salvación",Amor Secreto

Aún te quiero y tú lo sabes
Yo necesito que me ames

Ese beso, que se escapa de mí,

Existe un algo entre los dos,
Esa manera de sentir, que no es de amigos
Ese rato cuando hablamos los dos,
Esquivando miradas que pensamos,
Que la gente está ciega,
Que al fin la engañamos

Huele a peligro hablar contigo
Porque olvidamos que, hace tiempo,
Cada uno de los dos ya tiene un nido

Huele a peligro el sólo hecho de acercarme
A conversarte con el pretexto
De que de algo quiero hablarte
Un solo paso en falso
Y nada ya nos puede detener

Huele a peligro
Ese deseo que se esconde en la mirada
El fuego atroz de una pasión desesperada
Esa inquietud alborotada
Con el hambre retrasada

Cuando pierdes tus sueños y dejas atrás
A ese loco mal genio que escogí para amar

Me traicionas,
Cuando escondes la cara y no me dejas secar,
Esas lágrimas que quiero llorar junto a ti

Me hiciste tanto daño
Tú me enseñaste a amarlo
y ahora yo no sé olvidar

Años atrás te tenía en la mente
Cuando ibas a la escuela bajando la avenida
Amigo de tus amigos
Amigo de tus amigas
Así es como el reto
Ahora tú te encandilas

Recuerdo un verano fuimos juntos a Villa
La brisa fría hace ahora que tú te avecinas
Hago por ti como todo por las ruinas
Cuando la noche como tú
Ahora me cae encima
Se borra todo de mis ojos

Ya la siento que está muy lejos

Pero parece que no es suficiente
No se va, este deseo crece,
No se va, por eso es que me duele

Mírame, sufriendo por tus besos, por tu boca,
A punto de volverme loca, mírame,
Actuando como si fuera una niña,
Llorando porque extraño tus caricias
Las que me marcaron de por vida
Yo sé que terminamos para siempre,
Que lo mejor de todo ya pasó,
La vida nunca es como uno quiere,
Nada nos protege del dolor
Mírame,  sufriendo por tus besos, por tu boca",Mirame
Myriam Hernández,"Pensé que estaba curado de amor
Que estaba recuperado
Que había logrado cerrar con candado
Las puertas de mi alma después de un fracaso

Pero parece que el corazón
Se me quedo un poco abierto
Y al gusto de un beso nació un sentimiento
Que ya conocía y daba por muerto

No pensé enamorarme otra vez
No pensé estar tan loco por ti
Me doy cuenta que empiezo a ceder
Y me asusta saber el camino por donde pase

No pensé enamorarme otra vez
Porque cuando lo hice sufrí
Pero es fácil llegarte a querer
Y a pesar de tratar no consigo dejarte de amar

Yo me jure no entregarme al amor
Como lo hice algún día
Jure que seria conmigo egoísta
Pero no conté con tu cara tan linda

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.",Why Me Lord?
Myron Floren,"I love to go a-wandering
Along the mountain track 
And as I go, I love to sing
My knapsack on my back

Val-deri, val-dera
Val-deri, val-dera
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha
Val-dera
My knapsack on my back

I love to wander by the stream 
That dances in the sun
So joyously it calls to me
Come join my happy song

Val-eri, val-dera
Val-deri, val-dera
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha
Val-era
Come join my happy song

I wave my hat to all I meet
And They wave back to me
And blackbirds call so loud and sweet
From ev'ry green wood tree

Val-eri, val-dera
Val-deri, val-dera
Val-deri, val-dera

Oh, may I go a-wandering
Until the day I die
Oh, may I always laugh and sing
Beneath God's clear blue sky

Val-eri, val-dera
Val-eri, val-dera
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha
val-dera
Beneath the clear blue sky

Beneath the clear blue sky",The Happy Wanderer
