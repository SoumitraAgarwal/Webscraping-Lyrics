In Flames,"I see through thirty
Getting older every day
My soul drawing pictures
Of innocent times
Can you add color inside these lines

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don't want to live in a dream one more day

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don't want to live in a dream one more day

Sure if we change our perspective
I'm certain I will change today
I'm certain it will change our ways
When things fall into place

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don't want to live in a dream one more day

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don't want to live in a dream one more day

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don't want to live in a dream one more day

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don't want to live in a dream one more day

take me somewhere
Don't want to live in a dream one more day

In Flames,"I'm so restless
These walls drain my thoughts
Rooms with no sun
I can't find my way out

It used to be my home
These days far from my comfort zone
Alive but without control
Fear is taking hold

I should cross the line
Confront lives too blind

Hear a distant cry
Would you tell me how
Break the cycle that I'm in
And discover the living

I don't recognize my soul
Condemned to live in this black hole
Deep within time
Then crave warning signs

Hear a distant cry
Would you tell me how
Break the cycle that I'm in
And discover the living

I should cross the line
Confront lives too blind

Hear a distant cry
Would you tell me how
Break the cycle that I'm in

There's a hill to climb
Would you dream if I
Design the future
And lock the end of time
",Condemned [Vinyl Remaster 2016]
In Flames,"Look at the dead outside my window
Wonder what's on their mind
Why do they run?
They all seem to have a mission
But then they cry themselves to sleep

You receive what you give
And this is like nothing
Oh, I feel like shit
But at least I feel something
Is this all you're meant to be?

Their marks in the pavement
You walk this route too many times
What if I changed the signs?
Would you even take notice?

You receive what you give
And this is like nothing
I feel like shit
But at least I feel something
Is this all you have to give?

Straight jacket you yearn
In chains surrender

You receive what you give
And this is like nothing
Oh, I feel like shit
But at least I feel something

You receive what you give
And this is like nothing
I feel like shit
But at least I feel something

In Flames,"You wont,
Find a friendly face in the crowd,
It's quite amusing to see,
How you suffer now!

I refuse,to let you steal my delight,
When you awake, but it strengthens my night rage,
I've seen you kill many dreams,
But I've got brand new armor, and my weapons are way ahead of your's.

How does it feel to be demolished,
Fate plunged into thin air,
Strange to feeling to be nothing.

[Chorus]
All the words I hear,
They don't mean a thing
All drenched in fear,
Then I let you pray

Make me bother, I dare you,
I've got the strength I need,
But await my darkest moment,
When the guilt doesn't get to me

They don't mean a thing

In Flames,"I am my deepest shadow,
Something I can't ever neglect,
Rise above these ashes,
Before they fade away

In dark moments, I know better,
Within destruction, I see clearly

[Chorus]
From here to new grounds,
Suppose I will do it alone,
Will fight for that design,
Feel this up your conviction

Staring into truth,
I am, the way,
Existence careful made,
In all your everlasting complications

In dark moments,I know better
Within destruction, I see clearly

Forget the promised land,
There was never an invitation,
Today I create my own,
Before there was sorrow and lack of attention

In Flames,"It hurts to think
Can't get the sums together
Would you draw my bitterness
Make the pictures fade

Could it be that I see
What's beneath when we fall
The truth in ever
I'm scared that I will be

The sentence is light
But my eyes see a different world
And all I do is turn into flames

Will time open my vault
New solution, I'm begging
Break the fuse that holds me back

The I is lost in me
But I am ready to give you The M,
It might even be the E
As I begin to search for I
The I is lost in me

Distract, push me in another direction
This wall that I stare into
It's getting old
Give me faith to reach for the new
Pull me apart and do me all over
I'll need a re-make
To make up for my mistakes

The I is lost in me
But I am ready to give you The M,
It might even be the E
As I begin to search for I
The I is lost in me

What if I stop to care?
What if I let you fall?

What if I stop to care?
What if I let you fall?

The I is lost in me
But I am ready to give you The M,
It might even be the E
As I begin to search for I
The I is lost in me



",In Search for I [Vinyl Remaster 2016]
In Flames,"I used to adore you
The lies made sense somehow
Gave myself away without a fight
But betrayal claims its price

At first I was scared

But there was something beautiful
So powerful, different, so divine

Pushing the faith
Build on our rage

[Chorus]
Falling ideals
Broken seals
March to the shore
You are a killer!

Is it something that's always been there
Was it distant in this cage?
Oh, I'm glad we met
Oh, I'd love to release the rage

But everything has its end
I've done my deed
The final bullet was always meant for me!

Pushing the faith
Build on our rage

In Flames,"This spectacle, our collapse
It's not a false alarm
The ashes settle in

I guess, we are the insane
As we ignore the mirror's truth

Should I join the feast?
Should I acknowledge the leash?
A future in captivity
I'm not who I'm supposed to be

Without even trying 
Let this light explode

The bleeding, we deceive them
Fuel the life that fades
At the height of reason
We shouldn't live by your laws
Call the swarm
Feed them another false hope

Without even trying (killing the last scene)
Let this night explode
Without even trying
Find the exit sign and disappear

you ever come back home? So while you're searching for some direction, try to remember that I'm still waiting.
Why did you run away or was it home that ran away from you? You said that you would stay.
So where do you belong when things start to change? We can't choose
where we've come from, but we can choose where we go from here.
Maybe then things will be different when you can see there's still life in a dying tree.
We'll walk in an evergreen park, holding hands we begins to depart.
Face to face, eye-to-eye, on a deathbed we will
lie. What brought us together will tear us apart.

She smiled just like cinnamon

And you were one too
- would earth be weeping
So gentle and true?
If I was the garden
Whereas you could grow
-would you hand me your brAnches
And grant me your love?
In between the lines of your story-flowing through
The pages of a book so well prepared the
Words leave more than ashes from your pencil
When it speaks of tiny stories that happened
Through these years
I swear that your present reality-disillusioned
Obscurity? -will gently wipe away the tears
Of wasted seeds
How Can we go through this
- with wounded wing before we learned how to fly
How can I control desires
- when desires burns on a chilly autumn Night?
I will try and make you imagine;
The aura where they stand
Is filled with little secrets
- as written in the sand
Naked as a child at birth
A question in disguise
An oasis in a lonely desert
Where lonely unknown lands lie
From here and into infinity
- humble and timeless
Philosophy-you gently wept away the tears
Of wasted seeds
All the days that have left me
And the species I have seen
Ahead days will follow
- it was only a dream
Though my garden is growing
Under skies out of blue,
And it changes Each season
Both in colours and in truth
You should know that a willow
- a weeping bed's pillow-
Until all days are through
The rain that fall on your branches,
Just yearning for a source to feed it's primal need
Can make your beauty blossom from within
With flowers blowing in the wind-and in seasons to follow...

Meet me in the, in the next life

So now we've gone our own ways
Memories dried and scabbed
Your scars show on your hands
Mine show in my eyes
So now we've gone our own ways
Memories dried and scabbed
These scars show now

You're dangerous

I'll be waiting, waiting for you
Meet me in the, in the next life

Now we've gone our own ways
Memories dried and scabbed
These scars show now

In This Moment,"Breathing in and breathing out
My head leaned back, my hands are tied
I stand in here alone I scream
Questions why

Days slip by and nights I taste
These memories run through my veins
Injecting me with one last kiss
Screaming why

This medication can't save me
And desperation takes hold of me
I wanted to believe in all of this
And I wanted to believe in you
(You believed in me)

All I am, all I have
Leads me down these roads again
Take my hand, show me the way
And never bring me back here

Determination is pushing me
And perseverance is what I bleed
I wanted to believe in all of this
And I wanted to believe in you
(You believed in me)

All I am, all I have
Leads me down these roads again
Take my hand, show me the way
And never bring me back here

These are my unanswered prayers
The time has come for me
To say goodbye

God please hear me calling

All I am, all I have
Leads me down these roads again
Take my hand, show me the way
And never bring me back here again
Never bring me back here again
Never bring me back

These are my unanswered prayers
The time has come for me
To say goodbye

God please hear me calling",Prayers
In This Moment,"Can we run away tonight
And hide from tomorrows

The glass is cracking tonight
Shattering our fears away
The silence in here fades
And it's only your eyes that I see

Break me, I'm yours

Can we run away tonight
And hide from tomorrows

We die in this moment
And I don't want to wake from this

This road reminding me of all I am
As time drags on, these windows fade
Reality starts slipping from my mind
All I know is this all fades, the second that I'm by your side
Can this be real, can this be fate

Just say you'll be there for me
Please say that you'll be there
Just say that you'll be my side
When the storm subsides

All these years beneath the skin
Everything inside me turning to the shame
I was lost, but now I can see
This fate is turning deep inside of me
All I know is this all fades, the second that I'm by your side
Can this be real, can this be fate

I'll ask not for shelter or for charity

In deine Augen geschaut
Schenk' noch mal nach und dann nehmen wir ′n Taxi
Ins nächste Hotel
Schieß' den Leuchtturm aus, zieh die Vorhänge zu
Morgen früh wird es früh genug hell

Übers Meer, mit haushohen Wellen
Bin ich zehntausend Nächte gefahren
Und heute ist, glaub′ ich, die eine Nacht
Da legt mein Herz wieder an
Dein Mund verspricht mir den Himmel auf Erden
Vielleicht auch ′n bisschen Gefühl
Zum Festmachen wird es zu wenig sein
Und zum Ablegen ist es zu viel
Zum Ablegen ist es zu viel",Kap der Guten Hoffnung
Ina Müller,"Die Beine lang, der Ausschnitt tief,
Auch mein Begleiter schielt instinktiv zu ihr hin.
Ihr Augenaufschlag macht ihn an
So will es die Natur von Anbeginn.
Die Männerwelt scharrt mit dem Huf
Denn alles sahen ihr ruft zur Paarung auf.
Man checkt sie aus, sie lächelt brav,
Doch eigentlich ist sie nicht scharf darauf.

Ich möchte nie wieder 18 sein,
So niedlich, dumm und klein
So 'ne kichernde Backfischbraut,
Die dumm aus der Wäsche schaut.
Geklaute Meinung, verpeilter Stil,
Antiseptisch und steril.
Lieber Orangenhaut als gar kein Profil.
Ich hab lieber Orangenhaut,
Als gar kein Profil!
Sie guckt naiv und die Kerle kommen,
Jetzt fühlt sie sich echt ernst genommen, und gefragt.
Und jeder schiebt sie durch den Saal
Und nickt dazu im Takt, ganz egal was sie sagt.
Nur ein Glas Sekt und sie brabbelt los
Ihre Welt ist klein und die Pläne groß, sie will raus!
Vielleicht ein Jahr ins Ausland gehen
Karriere, Kinder, Diplom bestehen und 'n Haus.

Ich möchte nie wieder 18 sein,
So niedlich, dumm und klein
So 'ne kichernde Backfischbraut,
Die nervös auf den Nägeln kaut.

Eine Stimme klingt vertraut im Supermarkt
Dann seh' ich dich mit Frau und Kindern
Du bist inzwischen richtig grau und trägst jetzt Bart

Wieso ich damals so verliebt war
Das wirkt auf mich ganz plötzlich so absurd
Ich versuch′s noch mal zu fühlen
Doch diese Art so zu fühlen schlich für immer fort

Dass ich nächtelang nicht schlafe
Weil ich dich irgendwo gesehen hab
Ich die Tage nicht mehr schaffe
Ständig weine und zusammen klapp
Weil ich die ganze Nacht lang da saß
Damit ich deinen Anruf hör
Wie ein Orkan im Wasserglas

So was passiert mit heut' nicht mehr

Wenn ich mich heute wieder mal
In irgendjemanden verknall
Dann nicht so laut
Ich hab mein Herz unter Kontrolle
Es hat seitdem in keinem Fall mehr 
Auf Sand gebaut

Doch manchmal würd' ich′s gern
Ganz kurz zurückbekommen
Dieses Verlangen
So ′ne Herz-Schmerz-Tränen-Nacht
Die ich ganz locker dann am Morgen
Abstellen kann

Dass ich nächtelang nicht schlafe

Er sagt ist doch voll beknackt wie sehr man sich ändern kann
Er holt 'n Photo raus und sagt das war 'n Britt und ich

Das sind Liam und Noel in Köln vor'm Capitol

Immer wenn ich Brittpop, hören wir Oasis
Kein Reggae und kein Hip Hop, immer nur Oasis
Dann sind sie da, die neunziger
Und bei Wonderwall ruft sie, take me up to the top
Immer wenn ich Brittpop

Ich traf sie beim ersten Konzert, als sie vor der Bühne stand
Sie schrieb ihre Nummer auf, als sie mit der Band verschwand
Jetzt ham wir Kinder und sie jobt im ALDI Markt
Ich mach jetzt halb lang nach dem ersten Herzinfarkt
Jetzt ist sie so verkopft, wir tun's nicht mehr so oft.

Aber immer wenn ich Brittpop, hören wir Oasis

Dann sind sie da, die neunziger
Und bei Wonderwall ruft sie, take me to the top

Seh ich Britt in gemusterten Jeans und da muss ich mitsingen
Sie sah fast ein bißchen so aus wie Mel von den Spice Girls

Immer wenn ich Brittpop, hören wir Oasis

Grad noch nahm unser Leben sein Lauf, 
Plötzlich bäumt es sich auf und verstummt.

Er kriegt das Haus und die acht Zylinder
Du den Hund und die Kinder

Er wollte was jüngeres, jetzt hat ers' getan
Sowas hat's immer schon gegeben
So ist halt das Leben

Schieß' diesen Mann doch in den Wind
Manches ist einfach vorbestimmt

Männer sind untreu, Frauen falsche Schlangen
Autos sind immer schon kaputt gegangen
Kinder sind undankbar, Hunde korrupt
Oft haben sich Freunde als Feinde entpuppt
Aktien gehen oft in die Knie
Nur Schuhe enttäuschen dich nie

Guck in den Schrank, sie sind für dich da
Und können dir das Glück ganz schnell zurück holen
Auf ganz leisen Sohlen, hmm

Die streiten sich nie die bleiben ein Paar
Sie würden doch nie alleine ausgehen
Sich niemals im Weg stehen

Wenn ich alleine traurig bin
Zieht's mich zu Schuhverkäufern hin

Ina Müller,"Nachts um Viertel vor vier,
Klopfen die Nachbarn an die Tür.
Da waren sie 'n frisch verliebtes Paar.
Zwei, drei, viermal die Nacht, hat es damals ""Zoom"" gemacht.
Da war Klaus Lage noch 'n Star.

Kaum fängt der Tag dort an,
Liegt neben ihr ein toter Mann.
Sie denkt sich „Pfeif doch drauf“ und klappt ihr Laptop wieder auf.

Und dann spürt sie dieses Kribbeln, 
erst im Bauch dann überall, lass den Kerl doch einfach schlafen, 
das hier shoppt auf jeden Fall.
Wie oft hat sie sich schon gefragt, ob sie wieder aufhör'n kann, 
Aber nichts macht sie so an.
Weder Robin, noch Til Schweiger, noch Orlando.
Sie schreit nur noch bei Zalando.

Knapp, groß, breit oder schmal 
Und auch der Preis ist scheißegal, solangs ihr irgendwie gefällt.
Gold, pink, schwarz oder weiß das ist wie Schokoladeneis. 
So groß, wie dreimal um die Welt.
Und mit nur einem Klick kommt in der Nacht der große King.
Dieser Bestellreflex, der macht sie heißer noch als Sex.
Und schon morgen wirds geliefert: G-Star, Diesel und Lacoste.
Sie probiert alles kurz an und dann bringt ers' zurück zur Post.

Sag mir nicht das ich das bin
Der werd' ich sicher nicht die Zähne putzen

Schau mal in mein Perso rein
Das Foto in meinem Führerschein
Die Fremde da, die darf mich nicht mal dutzen

Ich mach das Licht jetzt aus und wenn ich's wieder an mach'
Will ich das du sofort aufhörst mit dem Scheiß

Spieglein, Spieglein an der Wand
Was zur Hölle ist passiert?
Ich hätt mich selbst fast nicht erkannt
Mein Gesicht ist kollabiert
Die Augenränder schlagen Wellen, da kann man sich fast drunterstellen
Selbst meine Falten, können mein Make-up nicht mehr halten

Krähenfüße, Größe zehn
Die bis zu den Ohren gehen
Wer hat die Luft aus meinem Kinn gelassen?

Die Oberlippe kräuselt sich
Ehrlich, man, das bin ich nicht
Jetzt hat mich sogar noch mein Tar verlassen

Ich mach das Licht jetzt aus und wenn ich's wieder an mach'
Will ich das du bitte aufhörst mit dem Scheiß

Ich hätt mich selbst fast nicht erkannt

Die Augenränder schlagen Wellen, da kann man sich fast drunterstellen
Selbst meine Falten, können mein Make-up nicht mehr halten

Bevor ich mich gleich wie jeden Morgen schnell
Wieder auf die Waage und dann mich selbst in Frage stell
Geh ich noch kurz zum Optiker rüber
Und hol mir meine Würde, und mein Glück
Aber vor allem meine alte Brille zurück

Wenn du laut pfeifst zum Radio

Vor der Glotze sitzt, ein Ohr am Telefon

Es war der letzte sichere Hafen
Hier bleiben wir, das wars
Wir malten Horizonte
In blauen, rauen Mengen
Um später doch vom Himmel

Bei jeder Liebe die wir machten, fielen wir wieder pubertär
Aus allen Wolken, weil wir dachten, dass es die letzte Liebe wär
Ein weiteres ""Für immer"" ins Leben eingeritzt
Wir hatten ja keinen Schimmer, dass nichts bleibt, wie es ist
Nichts bleibt, wie es ist

Bei jeder Liebe, die wir machten
Nahmen wir irgendetwas mit
Den wilden Kuss und wie wir lachten
Und diesen Spruch und unseren Hit
Ein Duft, der uns gleich anmacht
Egal, wer ihn grad trägt
Dieser Moment in einer Mondnacht
Der immer noch erregt

Wie oft lief ich ahnungslos
Am Mann meines Lebens vorbei
Wie viele Männer waren das bloß?
Verheiratet oder noch frei?
Wie viele Freunde hab ich nie gekannt?
Ich habs versucht mir auszumalen
Weil ich an ihnen etwas komisch fand
Da hätt' ich gern mal ein paar Zahlen

Was hab ich alles verpennt?
Ich zähle Schafe, weil ich nicht schlafe
In Gleichungen, die keiner kennt
Setze ich Worte, Namen und Orte
Wo sind die ganzen Unbekannten, die mir am Ende fehl'n
Verpasste Chancen, verpasste Chancen, kann man nicht seh'n

Und nachts im Bett rechnet mein Kopf sich warm
Teilt alles Glück nochmal durch zwei
Mein Herz wühlt immer noch in all den Jahr'n
Kam es nicht viel zu kurz dabei?

Ina Ray Hutton,"We leave home expecting to find a blue bird,
Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

When they sing you ""Look for the Silver Lining,""
It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.

But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

When there's nothing to say
I will find all the reasons
And kill all the good ones

I'll be around while you heading towards death town
Always look forward hardly never look back
So many tears and the snakes on my jock
Now I'm riding in my big fat ride

Your ass is late so look for the line
Nana in the house to let you know
What I see is how
I feel so leave me alone

I am lonely lonely lonely
I am lonely lonely in my life
I am lonely lonely lonely
God help me, help me to survive

Knock on my door whom you lookin' for
A dream or reality enemies at my door
Eyes, I realize it's fantasize I must be high
So let me live before I die

Once again grab the bottle twist the cap
To survive your life is yours my life is mine
No emotions in this world full of lies
Step by step and be versatile

Love peace and cash that's what it's all about
Alone by yourself than you lack there's no doubt about
I'm always into something making moves to improve
What would you do if you were in my shoes

Boom a letter oops another suicide
Meet me for a ride at the boulevard
Nana's in the house to let you know
What I see is how I feel and damn I'm alone",Pastor Solitario [The Lonely Shepherd]

From the moment that we met
I knew I wanna give all of myself to you

Now wherever I may be
I'd even brave the stormy sea
Won't tarry on a shore
That keeps me from your door

I wanna give more of me to you

I know I'll love you endlessly

Gets me to the core
And leaves me wanting more

I remember gazing on this quiet night, the stars were bright as they could be
Wonderin' if things would ever go right and if there was a spot up there for me
Then one star got brighter by the minute
Strange that it seemed to have my name written in it
I reached for the star and it kissed me with its light
It made me cast a shadow that was silver and bright

Silver shadow, a glowing shadow shining brightly for all to see

I never had any real reason to thank my lucky stars
But now I've got a pretty good reason 'cause I know I'm gonna go far
I believe in magic, I really do
With all that's happened, it's got to be true
I cast a silver shadow from the kiss of the light
I knew that I was destined starting with tonight

Silver shadow, a glowing shadow shining brightly for all to see
Silver shadow, my future's shadow trying to tell me of the star I would be

Since I was chosen among the rest, I dedicate myself, I'm gonna be the very best
And my shadow forever silver will remain and the world will always remember my name

I'd sooner sleep by an open fire and wake up fried

Say what you will
Say what you mean
You could never offend
Your dirty words come out clean

Tomorrow, what price will I pay?
Could I make it all up to you by serving coffee for two in bed?
Would you then gimme the time of day?

I need a map of your head
Translated into English
So I can learn not to make you frown
You'd feel better if you'd vent
Put your frustrations into four letter words
And let them out on mine
The most weathered ears in town

So say what you will
Say what you mean
You could never offend
Your dirty words come out clean",Clean
Incubus,"Blink and you miss a beat

Keep one of your eyes open at all times

Better clear the air before your son becomes a man

Everything's been augmented
You've been left so far behind
Think, for sure, next time you should wear a pair of eyes in the back of your
head
Consequence you've seen has been stranger than sci-fi of any kind
Situation baffles me
I guess it's true you are too one of the walking dead

You better think fast!

You better not blink!

It's bigger than you and me",Consequence

Then you crumble and blow away

If you let them fuck you

If I do, will I know when I'm there?
If the wind blew me in the right direction
Would I even care?

I would

Will I make it back to shore?

Incubus,"Two people touching lips
Hands on each others hips
Nothing else in the world but one another
The forty second floor
On a distant shore
I wonder how we strayed so far from this

Remember when we were
Just flesh and bone you sir
May have forgotten how good your world can be
So put down  your hollow tips
And kiss you lovers lips
And know that fate is what we make of it
Please end this please end this before it ends us, ends us, ends

I want to stay inside
I want to stay inside for good
I want to stay inside for good for good for good for good

I read the news today
And everything they say
Just makes me want to stay inside and wait
But the better part of me knows
That waiting in the throws
Is on a par with reading while my eyes are closed

""what can I do""? you say
""its just another day
In the life of apes with ego trips!""
Put down your hollow tips
And kiss your lovers lips
And know that fate is what we make of it

Please end this please end this before it ends us, ends us, ends us
I want to stay inside
I want to stay inside for good
I want to stay inside for good for good
Oh
I'm gonna stay inside
I'm gonna stay inside for good
I'm gonna stay inside for good for good
I want to stay inside
I want to stay inside for good

Rest until there's nothing left

Maybe ever and none
I forget about the pain
Someone bending light comes along
The flowers lean towards the sun

Some people fall in love and touch the sky
Some people fall in love and find quicksand
I hover somewhere in between I swear
I can't make up my mind

Independence Jazz Reunion,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

De la pasion why el sentimientro entre los dos
Me prometio que por nosotros el seria

Después de hacer todo este amor
Te vas sin un adiós
Sólo dices que me llamarás.
Me quedo con ganas de llorar
Porque me maltratas
Aún no entiendo por que te vas de mi.
Para demostra mi forma de amar.
Voy a conquistarte una vez más.
Sobre el fuego,
Sobre el viento
Why sobre el mar.
Quiero estar junto a tí
Why no dejarte ir.
Sobre el fuego
Sobre lo que pueda ser
No importa si hay que esperar
Yo esperaré por tí
Todo por tenerte
Tenerte junto a mí
Tú dices que yo no pienso en tí
Que vivo para mí
Que nunca tomo acciones por los dos
Soy mujer que lucha con pasión
No entiendes mi intención
Aún no captas que vivo por tu amor

Y yo que estoy a tu lado, haces de cuenta que no estoy
Se acabo, ahora me escuchas y te callas que yo tengo la razón
Tu te crees que soy tu tonta o que no tengo corazón
Ya vez que te equivocas, lo que no tenia es valor

Tu me cansaste la paciencia y hoy te pongo hasta aquí
Ya dime cara a cara, que tu quieres pues de mi
Que tu crees, que yo sin ti me muero, vete y veras que no
Tu crees que estoy contigo por que no hay otro mejor
No niño te equivocas, como hay un montón

Y oye bien
Si así vas a ser siempre, jamás seras un gran señor
Tu te crees indispensable y ese es tu gran error
Por eso es que me ignoras, como akilatas este amor

Ya ves que yo te adoro
Pero más me adoro yo
Ya yo no aguanto más mentiras
Más traiciones, más ya no

Dímelo
Anda y dímelo
Si tu me quieres o me amas, hablalo
Anda y dímelo
No te quedes con las ganas, mírame al acara

Anda y dímelo
Yo ya no aguanto más mentiras, hipocresía
Anda y dímelo
Vete ya, caminalo, olvídalo, dímelo

Si me quieres, si me amas
Dimelo",Dímelo

Pero yo no soy asi

Yo también fui lastimado
Sé muy bien lo que se siente

A nadie rencor le guardo
Aun con todo y sin embargo
Les perdono una vez mas

Por que
Todo lo pasado
Si no es bueno hay que olvidarlo
Sé muy bien que no es tan facil
Pero que le va uno hacer

Imposible de estar siempre
Dandole tanta importacia
Ya veraz que a la distancia
Todo queda en el ayer

Te comprendo y te respeto
Tu veras que con el tiempo
Yo te voy a demostrar

De este amor es puro y cierto

Baby we should sit, back and watch the moon glow
Baby, we should feel the wind blow

And it dies

And almost anyone will do to fill your idle time

you can share all your dreams with is so hard to find

And it use to be like me to settle for the physical
But these days it ain't too easy to make up my mind
Cause apparently you body just to temporally to take up my precious time

See I've got to know that
That I can be free with you and
you've got to show that
That you're worthy of my time
Can you stimulate my mind?

And I know that it looks good,
But can you be a part of my life
And I'm sure that it feels good
But can you be a part of my life
And it probably even taste good
But can you be a part of my life
I've got to know

I still appreciate the beauty of a man
But there's more to what I need now than what meets the eye
And if beauty's only skin deep,
Then your pretty skin won't send me to my highest high
Oh it's been along time come for maturity
And I believe that it's truly what it has to be
Cause as much as I admire you
My sexual desire, ain't controlling me

See I've got to know that
That I can be free with you and
you've got to show that
That you're worthy of my time
Can you stimulate my mind?

Why are you hiding from me
I'd quickly give my freedom
To be held in your captivity

I am ready for love
All of the joy and the pain
And all the time that it takes
Just to stay in your good grace
Lately I've been thinking
Maybe you're not ready for me
Maybe you think I need to learn maturity
They say watch what you ask for
Cause you might receive
But if you ask me tomorrow
I'll say the same thing

I am ready for love
Would you please lend me your ear?
I promise I won't complain
I just need you to acknowledge I am here

If you give me half a chance
I'll prove this to you
I will be patient, kind, faithful and true
To a man who loves music
A man who loves art
Respect's the spirit world
And thinks with his heart

I am ready for love
If you'll take me in your hands
I will learn what you teach

What matters most is what you think of yourself

Thought it will never change but this time moved on
An ugly duckling grew up to be a swan
And now your chest burns and your back aches
Because now the years are showing up on your face
But you're never be happy
And you'll never be whole
Until you see the beauty in growing old

remember we
chose a star

How I lost me, and you lost you
What are all these voices outside love's open door

All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning them again

Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined and people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age?
And the trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness 
Are the very things we kill, I guess
Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms 
And the world they put between us - you know it doesn't keep us warm

Small, tryin' to ball, always been black
And my hair, I tried it all I even went flat
Had a lumpy curly top and all that crap, now
Just tryin' to be appreciated
Nappy headed brothers never had no ladies
And I hit the barber shop real quick
Had 'em give me lil' twist and it drove 'em crazy (crazy)
Then I couldn't get no job
'Cause corporate wouldn't hire no dreadlocks
Then I thought about my dogs from the block
Kinda understand why they chose to steal and rob
Was it the hair that got me this far
All these girls these cribs these cars?
I hate to say it but it seem so flawed
'Cause success didn't come till I cut it all off

Little girl with the press and curl
Age eight, I got a Jheri curl
Thirteen, and I got a relaxer
I was a source of so much laughter
At fifteen when it all broke off
Eighteen and went all natural
February, 2002
I went on and did what I had to do
Because it was time to change my life
To become the woman that I am inside
Ninety-seven dreadlocks all gone
I looked in the mirror for the first time and saw that

Hey (hey)
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am not your expectations, no (hey)
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am the soul that lives within

Good hair means curls and waves (no)
Bad hair means you look like a slave (no)
At the turn of the century
It's time for us to redefine who we be
You can shave it off like a South African beauty
Or get in on lock like Bob Marley
You can rock it straight like Oprah Winfrey
If it's not what's on your head, it's what's underneath, and say

Hey (hey)
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am not your expectations, no (hey)
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am the soul that lives within

Who cares if you don't like that?
With nothin' to lose, postin' with the wave cap
And the cops wanna harass 'cause I got waves
Ain't see nothin' like that in all my days
Man, you gotta change all these feelings
Steady judging one another by their appearance
Yes, India, I feel ya, girl
Now go ahead, talk to the rest of the world 'cause

(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Does the way I wear my hair make me a better person?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Does the way I wear my hair make me a better friend? Oh

Does the way I wear my hair determine my integrity?

Took away her crownin' glory

I'm having a private party

Learning how to love me
Celebrating the woman I've become, yeah

I tried to call my mother, but
She didn't get where I was going
I called my boyfriend, and he said
""Call me back a little later, baby.""

Started to feel a little pity
That's when I realized that I
Gotta find the joy inside of me

Look at myself in the mirror
We're gonna have a conversation
We're gonna heal the disconnection

My body is beautiful and sacred
And I'm gonna celebrate it

I've been looking for (I've been looking for)

This is not ego or vanity (oh)
I'm just celebrating me

Sometimes I'm alone, but never lonely
That's what I've come to realize
I've learned to love the quiet moments
The Sunday mornings of life
Where I can reach deep down inside
Or out into the universe
I can laugh until I cry
Or I can cry away the hurt

I thought that I needed a lot 
A little was over rated
But a lot was a little too complicated 
You see, zero didn't satisfy me 
A million didn't make me happy 
That's when I learned the lesson 
That it's all about your perceptions
Hey, are you a pauper or a superstar?
So you act, so you feel, so you are 
It ain't about the size of your car 
It's about the size of the faith in your heart

It doesn't cost a thing to smile 
You don't have to pay to laugh 
You better thank God for that

You better thank God for that

A met a young brother that made me feel 
That I could accomplish anything

(He had) no windows and no doors 
He lived a simple life and was extremely poor 
On top of all of that, he had no eyesight
(But that didn't keep him from seein' the light)
(He said) what's it like in the USA?
And all I did was complain 
(He said) living here is paradise
He taught me paradise is in your mind; you know that...

The government - they keep on lying 
But we gotta keep on surviving 
Keep living our truth and do the best we can do

I took a swim in the sea of guilt and misery
To find myself on an island in the middle of nowhere
In my solitude, I asked to know the highest truth
And what I was told is to thy own self be true

If Jesus can forgive crucifixion
Surely, we can survive and find a resolution

Why are they so angry, why are they so loud?

Were all simply doing the best that we can
And we have a choice to live or truly be alive

Indigo,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Oh, said the joker to the thief
I want to tell you now there's just too much confusion
And I can't, no, I can't get no relief

Ah, these businessmen, they all, they drink our wine
And the plowman, well, he dig my earth
And you know that ah none of them along the line
Can show me what any of this is worth
You know we wanted to see it now, didn't we? Didn't we?

""There ain't no reason to get excited""
Ah, the thief, you know he kindly spoke
Well, now there are those among us right here, right now
Who still see life as some kind of a joke

But you and I, we have been through that
I tell you that this, this is not our fate, no no no
Now, let us all not talk falsely now
You know the hour, well, it's getting late

I said all along the watchtower, the princes, they kept the view
While the women, the women, they came and then they went
Oh, and the barefoot servants too, that's me, that's you
But outside there's a cold distance
Listen for the wildcats, here them growl
Two riders were approaching as the wind began to howl

Oh, there are those among us right here, right now
Who still see life as some kind of a joke
All along the watchtower, said, all along this watchtower
Those of you who still have eyes to see, ears hear me

You will be saved by grace in the end
Saved by time if you don't understand
That your hatred is rooted in your fear
And your paranoia and insecurities
Well, they don't belong here

You got to take someones hand
You got to learn to make your stand
And it's a one, two, three, four
Look at the sky, you can open the door
And take my hand, take my hand, take my hand

Ah, don't you want to touch
Don't you want to feel
Don't you know that this is real
I said shelter me, shelter me
Shelter me, shelter me

And save yourself, save yourself
Save, save, save
Save, save, save
Save, save, save
Save, save

And you, and you
And you are a part of the world

You know that you are real

Indigo Girls,"You and me of the 10,000 wars
Dividing life into factions of pleasure and chores
A bed to be made and a bed to lie in
A hand in the darker side
And our sights set on zion

The heart of a skeptic and the mind of a child
Put my life in a box and let my imagination run wild
Pour the cement for my feet
The heart and the mind on a parallel course
Never the two shall meet
And oh the dissatisfied with the satisfied
Everybody loves a melodrama and the scandal of a lie
Still you held your arms open
For the prodigal daughter
I see my eyes in your eyes through my eyes
Still waters

Try making one and one make one
Twist the shapes until everything comes undone
Watch the wizard behind the curtain
The larger than life and the power of seeming certain
The evil ego and the vice of pride
Is there ever anything else that makes us take our different sides
I wanted everything to feed me
About as full as I got was of myself
And the upper echalons of mediocrity
And oh the dissatisfied with the satisfied
Everybody loves a melodrama and the scandal of a lie
Still you held your arms open
For the prodigal daughter
I see my eyes in your eyes through my eyes
Still waters
Still waters

After the battles and we're still around
Everything once up in the air has settled down
Sweep the ashes let the silence find us
A moment of peace is worth every war behind us

Indigo Girls,"Up on the airplane
Nearer my god to thee
I start making a deal
Inspired by gravity
If I did wrong I won't do it again
'Cause I can be sweet and good and nice 
And if I had enemies their friends
I'll hold to my life with the grip of a vice

And I'm up on the airplane
Nearer my god to thee
I start making a deal
Inspired by gravity

That little spot on the ground is my hometown
I like to call it my home and it's sweet
I'd rather take a seat down there
Than a throne up here up above 30,000 feet
And I'm up on the airplane

I never should have read my horoscope
Or the fortune on the bubble strip
Saying what you think won't happen will
A great thing to read before a trip
On an airplane

Pilot says the big blue sky's like a swimming pool
Big fluffy clouds like a feather bed
I'd rather have a real pillow underneath my head
Lying in my bed which is in my hometown
Which is on the ground

On a single thread for the black

The power ring
In an endless split decision
Never solve anything

The fences in our own backyards

Like ashes in the winds of change

Is the fuel for the flame
So the darker the ages get
There's a stronger beacon yet

In the turn of the cheek
When your vision stays clear
In the face of your fear

In a mighty tower
All for one and one for all

From your pearly gates
I realize that I just can't stay
All those mountains
They kept you locked inside
And hid the truth
From my slighted eyes

I came to you with a half-open heart
Dreams upon my back
Illusions of a brand new start

Can't I carry the load
Is it my fault that
I can't reap what I sow

Did you give me half a chance
With your southern style
And your hidden dance away
You dance away
And you dance away

All these voices
They whisper through my walls
They talk of falling fast
They say I'm losing it all
They say I'm running blind
To love of my own
But I'll be walking proud
I'm saving what I still own

I fell on my knees to kiss your land
But you are so far down
And I can't even see to stand
In nashville
You forgot the human race
You see with half a mind
What colors hide the face

I'd like to know your fate
I'd like to stay a while
But I've seen your lowered states today
I've seen 'em today
Honey I swear I've seen 'em today

Now I'm leaving
I've got all these debts to pay
You know we all have our dues
I'll pay 'em some other place
Ah I never ask that you pay me back
We all arrive with more
I left with less than I had

A last chance for a cause
I thought I knew
But nashville
You tell me what you are gonna do
With all your southern style
It'll never pull you through

I can't place no blame
But if you forget my face
I'll never call your name again

Juliet says ""hey, it's romeo!""
""you nearly give me a heart attack!""
Yeah well, he's underneath the window

And you can fall for chains of gold

I watched your taillights blaze into nothingness
But you were long gone before I ever got to you
Before you blazed past this address

And now I think of having loved and having lost
But never know what it feels like to never love
Who can say what's better when my heart's become the cost
A mere token of a brighter jewel sent from above

Fare thee well my bright star
The vanity of youth the color of your eyes
And maybe if I'd fanned the blazing fire of your day-to-day
Or if I'd been older I'd been wise

Too thick the heat of those long summer evenings
For a cool evening I began to yearn
But you could only feed upon the things which feed a fire
Waiting to see if I would burn

Fare thee well my bright star
It was a brief brilliant miracle dive
That which I looked up to and I clung to for dear life
Had to burn itself up just to make itself alive

And I caught you then in your moment of glory
Your last dramatic scene against a night sky stage
With a moment so clear that it's as if you're still before me
My once in a lifetime star of an age

So fare thee well my bright star

He don't know much about the issues
So he picks up the phone and calls the senator out in Indian Country

New hampshire, vermont, bordered by
College farms, hubcaps, and falling rocks
Voices in the woods and the mountaintops

Before I realized everywhere I stand
There have tribal feet running wild as fire
Some past life sister of my desire

Steady now and don't come out
I'm not ready for the dead to show it's face
Whose turn is it anyway?
Anyway?

Now when I was young my people taught me well
Give back what you take or you'll go to hell
It's not the devil's land, you know it's not that kind

Every devil I meet is an angel in disguise

But there's a tremor growing in our backyard
Fear in our heads, fear in our hearts

Indigo Girls,"I don't know if it was real or in a dream
Lately waking up I'm not sure where I've been
There was a table set for six and five were there
I stood outside and kept my eyes upon that empty chair
And there was steam on the windows from the kitchen
Laughter like a language I once spoke with ease
But I'm made mute by the virtue of decision
And I choose most of your life goes on without me
Oh the fear I've known
That I might reap the praise of strangers
And end up on my own
All I've sown was a song
But maybe I was wrong

I said to you the one gift which I'd adore
The package of the next 10 years unfolding
But you told me if I had my way I'd be bored
Right then I knew I loved you best born of your scolding
When we last talked we were lying on our backs
Looking at the sky through the ceiling
I used to lie like that alone out on the driveway
Trying to read the Greek upon the stars
The alphabet of feeling
Oh I knew back then
It was a calling that said if joy then pain
The sound of the voice these years later
Is still the same

I am alone in a hotel room tonight
I squeeze the sky out but there's not a star appears
Begin my studies with this paper and this pencil
And I'm working through the grammar of my fears
Oh mercy what I won't give
To have the things that mean the most
Not to mean the things I miss
Unforgiving the choice still is
The language or the kiss",Language or the Kiss

I wasn't sure when I would see you again
Yours was a twisted blind sided highway
No matter which road you took then
Oh you set up your place in my thoughts
Moved in and made my thinking crowded
Now we're out in the back with the barking dogs
My heart the red sun
Your heart the moon clouded
I could go crazy on a night like tonight
When summer's beginning to give up her fight
And every thought's a possibility
And the voices are heard but nothing is seen
Why do you spend this time with me
Maybe an equal mystery

So what is love then is it dictated or chosen
(Handed down and made by hand)
Does it sing like the hymns of 1000 years
Or is it just pop emotion
(Handed down and made by hand)
And if it ever was there and it left
Does it mean it was never true
And to exist it must elude
Is that why I think these things of you
I could go crazy on a night like tonight
When summer's beginning to give up her fight
And every thought's a possibility
And the voices are heard but nothing is seen
Why do you spend this time with me
May be an equal mystery

It shines like sugar on your lips
And you like to stand in the line of fire
Just to show you can shoot straight from you hip
There must be a 1000 things you would die for
I can hardly think of two
But not everything is better spoken aloud
Not when I'm talking to you

Oh the pirate gets the ship and the girl tonight
Breaks a bottle to christen her
Basking in the exploits of her thief

Is to meet in the middle of impossibility

With haughty eyes and lying tongues
And hands that shed innocent blood
Now who delivered you the power
To interpret calvary
You gamble away our freedom
To gain your own authority

Find another state of mind

To grab hold
Strange fire burns
With the motion of love

You will dissolve all the stones that are cast
Now you will learn to burn the icing sky

Indigo Girls,"Early one morning the sun was shining
I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like mama's homemade dress
Papa's bank book wasn't big enough
Me I'm standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
I'm heading out to the east coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue

she was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam I guess
But I used a little too much force
And we drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out west
We split up on a sad dark night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around and looked at me
As I was walking away
Then I heard her say over my shoulder
We'll meet again someday
On the avenue
Tangled up in blue

I was living in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
I never did like it all that much
And one day the axe just fell
So I drifted down to new orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Yeah I was working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of de la croix
And all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I'd seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue

she was working at a topless bar
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
Now later on as the crowd thinned out
And I was just about to do the same
Yeah but she was standing there at the back of my chair
She said don't I know your name
Well I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoes
We were tangled up in blue
I know I know I know

she lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
I thought you'd never say hello she said
You look like the silent type
And then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an italian poet
From the 13th century
Every one of his words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off every page
Like it was written in my soul
From me to you
Tangled up in blue
Yeah yeah

I lived with them on montague street
In a basement down the stairs yeah
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
That's when he started into dealing with slaves yeah
Something inside of her died just died
And she had to sell everything she owned
And she froze up inside
Finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
Oh yeah

now I'm headed back again
I gotta get to her somehow
And all the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
I don't know how they all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me I'm still on the road
Headed for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point
Of view

Indigo Girls,"I'm coming home with a stone, strapped onto my back
I'm coming home with a burning hope turning all my blues to black.
I'm looking for a sacred hand to carve into this stone.
A ghost of comfort, Angel's Breath  - to keep this life inside my chest.
This world falls on me with hopes of immortality
Everywhere I turn all the beauty just keeps shaking me.

I woke up in the middle o f a dream, scared the world was too much for me.
Sejarez said, ""Don't leg go, just plant the seeds and watch them grow.""
I've slept in rainy canyon lands, cold drenched to my skin.
I always wake to fin a face to calm these troubled lands.
This world falls on me with hopes of immortality
Everywhere I turn all the beauty just keeps shaking me.

Running, end, earth, swimming, edge, sea, laughing, under, starry sky
This world was meant for me.
Don't bury me, carry me.
I wish I was a nomad, an Indian, or a saint.
The edge of death would disappear, leave me nothing to taint.
I wish I was a nomad, an Indian, or a saint.
Give me walking shoes, feathered arms, and a key to heaven's gate.

Everywhere I turn all the beauty just keeps shaking me.",World Falls

Dug our nails in the dirt
(Hung our towel soaked souls out on the line) 
Hung our towel soaked souls out on the line

To ease my pain I took a pen and paper
Incarnate came the bleeding

You used to mock me
Sometimes I would cry when I was home later
You hurt my feelings
Why why why
Send it down in your notebook

Is in your madness
Will you get better
Then will you leave us?
How you mixed with the darkness
At such a young age
Until in your chemistry
Science and violence turned
Silence to rage

Why are you dreaming this,
One shoe off and a bridge to cross over
And where is your taxi fare,
Are you left by yourself or left by your lover?
For three nights straight now I dream I keep both of my shoes
But I've forgotten my lines
And I've misplaced my cues
And there's a sea full of faces and a show to go on,
And I'm struck mute at entrance with nothing to draw from

There were the secrets
The big bang and the bigger joke
You seem to know all of them
And injustice makes you red with choke
You love like your desperate
You don't know what love is
I thought if there was one thing I could give you
One thing I could give you,
Maybe it was this

With your head on the bed board
The anguished repeat
The sweat of our sadness
The twist of the sheets

So we must love while these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust
Until time makes history of us.

Jeu de Paume's full of faces knowing peace, knowing strife
Leisure and toil, still it's canvas and oil
There's just no medium for life
In the midst of the rubble I felt a sense of rebirth
In a dusty cathedral the living God called
And I prayed for my life here in earth

So we must love while these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust
Until time makes history of us.

There are mountains in Switzerland, brilliant cold as they stand
From my hotel room, watching the half-moon
Bleeding its light like a lamb
And the town is illuminated, its tiny figures are fast asleep
And it dawns on me the time is upon me
To return to the flock I must keep.

So we must love while these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust
Until time makes history of us.",History of Us
Indigo Girls,"For you
I would tattoo me
With lines crossing into a hand
And a heart that would never bleed
With the twilight
And the horse drawn on my arm
Standing for an addiction
Pray we go unharmed

Here is my love and anger
You see now
These are my gods
These are my scars
Here is my love and anger
Well these arms are burning
But they're open wide

Some things
I hold too tightly
Some things
I'll never
I'll never touch
Oh but I'm wearing down the stones
In the river
And you see all my life
I've painted with anger's brush

Now, now could you
Lift me through my love and anger
You see now
These are your gods
These are my scars
Lift me through my love and anger
Ah and my arms are burning
But they're open wide

Oh
You precious kid
I have a motion
And it's just for you
I see a warrior
Barefoot and dancing
Oh with tears of pain and beauty
And all of this is true

For you
Lift me through my love and anger
You see now these are my gods
These are your scars

Indigo Girls,"During the time of which I speak it was hard to turn the other cheek
To the blows of insecurity
Feeding the cancer of my intellect the blood of love soon neglected
Lay dying in the strength of its impurity
Meanwhile our friends we thought were so together
They've all gone and left each other in search of fairer weather
And we sit here in our storm and drink a toast
To the slim chance of love's recovery

There I am in younger days, star gazing
Painting picture perfect maps of how my life and love would be
Not counting the unmarked paths of misdirection
My compass, faith in love's perfection
I missed ten million miles of road I should have seen
Meanwhile our friends we thought were so together
Left each other one by one along the road of fairer weather
And we sit here in our storm and drink a toast
To the slim chance of love's recovery

Rain soaked and voice choked like silent screaming in a dream
I search for our absolute distinction
Not content to bow and bend
To the whims of culture that swoop like vultures
Eating us away, eating us away
Eating us away to our extinction
Oh how I wish I were a trinity, so if I lost a part of me
I'd still have two of the same to live
But nobody gets a lifetime rehearsal, as specks of dust we're universal
To let this love survive would be the greatest gift that we could give
Tell all the friends who think they're so together
That these are ghosts and mirages, all these thoughts of fairer weather
Though it's storming out I feel safe within the arms of love's discovery",Love's Recovery
Indigo Girls,"I'm in search of greener pastures
Don't like my garden's what I said
Although I'm working harder than last year
I'm still deep in the red
I am rowing as hard as I can
And they're selling me up a stream
I'm always one more step away
From the american dream

I got a chip on my shoulder
About the size of a mental block
I've got someone on the telephone
Trying to sell me a future in stock
Maybe I work too hard to be happy
And I should practice letting go
But it's hard not to rock the boat
When you're sailing against the undertow

[Chorus]
I want to slide into the black
And wear the black mask
I might not get what I lack
But it doesn't hurt to ask
If I want to sail
I need my life to be breezier
I said please god or someone
Make it easier

I went to Sunday school every Sunday
Swallowed the bait and I got the hook
When I needed something someday
I would read the good book
Tell me what does it take to get ahead
Sometimes I know I'd sell my soul
When it looks like everybody else is flying
And I'm crawling in the hole

Well maybe if I open my own business
Maybe if I buy a lottery ticket
Someone tell me what is the secret
To getting out of the thicket
Give me more than just a sample
I need a whole lot of glory
My life become an example
Of the american success story

Indigo Girls,"Maybe we'll make Texas by the morning
Light the bayou with our taillights in the night
Eight hundread miles to El Paso from the state line
And we never have the money for the flight

I'm in the back seat sleepy from the travel
Played our hearts out all night long in New Orleans
I'm dirty from the diesel fumes, drinking coffee black
When the first breath of Texas comes in clean

And there's something bout the Southland in the springtime
Where the waters flow with confidence and reason
Though I miss her when I'm gone it won't ever be too long
'Til I'm home again to spend my favorite season

When God made me born a Yankee He was teasin'
There's no place like home and none more pleasin'
Than the Southland in the springtime

In Georgia nights are softer than a whisper
Beneath a quilt somebody's mother made by hand
With the farmland like a tapestry passed down through generations
And the peach trees stitched across the land

There'll be cider up near Helen off the roadside
And boiled peanuts in a bag to warm your fingers
And the smoke from the chimney meets its maker in the sky
With a song that winter wrote whose melody lingers.",Southland in the Springtime

Do you think about it

Turning brushwood
Into blazes
Turning summer grass
Into hay

Sprinkled with horses
Wild in resistance to the taming

In our adolescent war

From the warm air through the screen
You come regular like seasons
Shadowing my dreams

And the Mississippi's mighty
But it starts in Minnesota
At a place that you could walk across
With five steps down
And I guess that's how you started
Like a pinprick to my heart
But at this point you rush right through me
And I start to drown

And there's not enough room
In this world for my pain
Signals cross and love gets lost
And time passed makes it plain
Of all my demon spirits
I need you the most
I'm in love with your ghost
I'm in love with your ghost

Dark and dangerous like a secret (don't tell a soul)
That gets whispered in a hush
When I wake the things I dreamed about you (don't tell a soul)
Last night make me blush
And you kiss me like a lover
Then you sting me like a viper
I go follow to the river
Play your memory like a piper

And I feel it like a sickness
How this love is killing me
I'd walk into the fingers
Of your fire willingly
And dance the edge of sanity
I've never been this close
In love with your ghost, ooh

Ooh
Unknowing captor
You never know how much you
Pierce my spirit
But I can't touch you
Can you hear it
A cry to be free
Oh I'm forever under lock and key
As you pass through me

Now I see your face before me
I would launch a thousand ships
To bring your heart back to my island
As the sand beneath me slips
As I burn up in your presence
And I know now how it feels
To be weakened like Achilles
With you always at my heels

This bitter pill I swallow
Is the silence that I keep
It poisons me I can't swim free
The river is too deep
Though I'm baptized by your touch
I am no worse than most

And steam comes up and out the tears you see me shine
For every strange and bitter moment there was never a better time

For every pleasure exacts its pain
How you hurt me how you were good to me
Beneath my window a mournful train that makes me smile at my bad poetry
Beneath my surface a song is rising
It may be simple while it hides its true intent
We may be looking for our deliverance but it has already been sent

It's in the night fall when the light falls
And what you've seen isn't there anymore
It's in our blind trust that love will find us
Just like it has before

They're sending soldiers to distant places
X's and O's on someone's drawing board
Like green and plastic but with human faces
And they want to tell you it's a merciful sword

But with all the blood newly dried in the desert
Can we not fertilize the land with something else
There is no nation by god exempted
Lay down your weapons and love your neighbor as yourself

In the night fall when the light falls
And what you've seen isn't there anymore
It's through our blind trust that love will find us
Just like it has before",Our Deliverance

Somebody lit a cigarette

Backbreaking pickers in the patches

The size of my land locked travels 

I try to put it aside
But it's too much bigger than me

Lighting and leaving
And there's tea leaves tossing
Heads up pennies in my pocket
Dead star like a rocket

It's not a kingdom
It's not an angry god

It feels like no fear
It feels like no doubt

The crime was lookin' up the truth
And as the bombshells of my daily fears explode
I try to trace them to my youth
 
And then you had to bring up reincarnation 
Over a couple of beers the other night
And now I'm serving time for mistakes 
Made by another in another life time

How long 'til my soul gets it right 
Can any human being ever reach that kind of light
I call on the resting soul of Galileo king of night vision
King of insight
 
And then I think about my fear of motion
Which I never could explain
Some other fool across the ocean years ago
Must have crashed his little airplane
 
How long 'til my soul gets it right 
Can any human being ever reach that kind of light
I call on the resting soul of Galileo king of night vision
King of insight
 
I'm not making a joke
You know me I take everything so seriously
If we wait for the time 'til all souls get it right
Then at least I know there'll be no nuclear annihilation in my life time 
I'm still not right

I offer thanks to those before me
That's all I've got to say
'Cause maybe you squandered big bucks in your lifetime
Now I have to pay

But then again it feels like some sort of inspiration
To let the next life off the hook
Or she'll say look what I had to overcome from my last life
I think I'll write a book

How long 'til my soul gets it right
Can any human being ever reach the highest light
Except for Galileo, God rest his soul
King of the night vision, king of insight
How long (until my soul gets it right)
How long (until my soul gets it right)
How long",Galileo [DVD][Live]

Heartsick we nursed along the way we picked up
You may not see it when it's sticking to your skin
But we're better off for all that we let in

So much promises and work left undone
When all that guards us is a single centerline
And the brutal crossing over when it's time

With glory days of put up dukes for all the world to see
Beaten into submission in the name of the free

Everyone's so busy now but do we move ahead
The planets hurting and atoms splitting
And a sweater for your love you sit there knitting

Tied with ribbons in the medium
They make me grateful I can go this far
Lay me down and never wake me up again

Kat writes a poem and she sticks it on my truck
We don't believe in war and we don't believe in luck
The birds were calling to her what were they saying
As the gate blew open the tops of the trees were swaying

I've passed the cemetery walk my dog down there
I read the names in stone and say a silent prayer
When I get home you're cooking supper on the stove
And the greatest gift of life is to know love

Can we call from the mountain to the valley below?
Can we make it better

We keep making it worse, we keep getting it wrong

Will it bring us together
Can we call from the mountain to the valley below?

Do we tether the hawk, do we tether the dove?

Indigo Girls,"There's a letter on the desktop that I dug out of a drawer
The last truce we ever came to
In our adolescent war
And I start to feel the fever
From the warm air through the screen
You come regular like seasons
Shadowing my dreams

And the Mississippi's mighty
But it starts in Minnesota
At a place that you could walk across
With five steps down
And I guess that's how you started
Like a pinprick to my heart
But at this point you rush right through me
And I start to drown

And there's not enough room
In this world for my pain
Signals cross and love gets lost
And time passed makes it plain
Of all my demon spirits
I need you the most
I'm in love with your ghost
I'm in love with your ghost

Dark and dangerous like a secret (don't tell a soul)
That gets whispered in a hush
When I wake the things I dreamed about you (don't tell a soul)
Last night make me blush
And you kiss me like a lover
Then you sting me like a viper
I go follow to the river
Play your memory like a piper

And I feel it like a sickness
How this love is killing me
I'd walk into the fingers
Of your fire willingly
And dance the edge of sanity
I've never been this close
In love with your ghost, ooh

Ooh
Unknowing captor
You never know how much you
Pierce my spirit
But I can't touch you
Can you hear it
A cry to be free
Oh I'm forever under lock and key
As you pass through me

Now I see your face before me
I would launch a thousand ships
To bring your heart back to my island
As the sand beneath me slips
As I burn up in your presence
And I know now how it feels
To be weakened like Achilles
With you always at my heels

This bitter pill I swallow
Is the silence that I keep
It poisons me I can't swim free
The river is too deep
Though I'm baptized by your touch
I am no worse than most
In love with your ghost (in love with your ghost)

You are shadowing my dreams
(In love with your ghost)

Indigo Girls,"It's over, hang your gun down
And eat this simple fare
What you need is to feed on something
Warm and hand prepared

The ice at the edges
Waters, change is near
And send you, give in to
And free your long imprisoned tears

Walk your valley, walk your shadow
Afraid but on your feet
'Til your fire in the sky meet

So sick mad seas made me
Tossed at such a clip
How I clung to you, horizon
The captain of my ship

Your flame never faltered
Even in the fiercest wind
Even the strongest wick grows dim and sick
When it's burning at both ends

Walk your valley, walk your shadow
Afraid but on your feet
'Til your fire in my sky meet

There is nothing but now
Here's a cloth for your brow
You've done well
But it's time you rest awhile

You've taken on the whole world
Like a boy, like a girl
You're a full grown wonder
You're a child

All mis-believers
Speak with ease a cynic tongue
All is simple and loaded
Like buttons come undone

Like dreams and guns and questions
On fire but still alive
Unlock your best potential
[Incomprehensible] your sites on love tonight

Walk your valley, walk your shadow
Afraid but on your feet
'Til your fire in the sky meet

Walk your fire, walk your fire
Afraid but on your feet
'Til your fire in my sky meet

Indigo Girls,"When we get back to winthrop
A few miles from the airport
On a plastic chair
On a deck where my friends live
I watch the taking off airplanes
I watch the ocean waves crashing
With all of this movement something's got to give

Down at the hi-tide
Passed down through the family
The fishermen gather to complain about the catch
They talk about time
They talk about tides
The pull of the moon and the coffee deep night black
And I listen to them
And I listen to you
And for everyone there is something never coming back

But for all that we've been through
For all that we've promised
Your wayward direction seems insensible
Words fall off like breathless fish
All flopping and scattered
And hearts picked over deemed dispensible

Down at the hi-tide
We're there for our last meal
The broken loaves are still enough for all
And we talk about time
And we talk about tides
Under the moon with the deep night coffee black
I hear the dim roar of the last flight out
And for someone there is someone never coming back

",Winthrop
Indigo Girls,"I wasn't looking to shift my direction 
My eyes straight ahead hands ten and two 
The gravity of our first connection 
Veering off the road and into you 
All the people drive by slowly gawking at the scene 
Of the smoldering inevitable spark and gasoline 

All the way I met you head on full speed 
At the heart the blue flame burns 
All the way I took the crash course impact 
But have I learned all that I'm supposed to learn 

No amount of playing safe could save me from this day 
The head seeking path of my trajectory 
Didn't we cooly divest of predestination 
Slamming into futures we can't see 
I know what can happen when there's more than meets the eye 
But there's no way to avoid it just get in the car and drive 

All the way I met you head on full speed 
At the heart the blue flame burns 
All the way I took crash course impact 
But have I learned all that I'm supposed to learn 

It makes me laugh, we?re talking over tea 
When I can still smell the smoke on my sleeve 
Steaming like gun smoke the wreckage of our past 
The scene of a crime I still can't leave 
Oh you and me, we should let well enough be 
But each revisitation points to clues 
There's the oil slick of uncertainty 
And warning signs back there we didn't use 
At least we laugh about it now how we escaped alive 
It's remarkable the mess we make and what we can survive 

(repeat chorus)
",All the Way
Indigo Girls,"You're looking at foreclosure
And doing time,
And it don't sound good this time.
They found the meth and the scales,
And the wife that made your life Hell.

All that time you were telling me
You were fine.
Silly man.

So I got your dog.
How is that?
I made it nice, I wrote a check.
You cut the weeds back on my drive,
'cause you're a good guy,
Deep down inside.

What makes a boy like you go bad?
What makes a man so lonely and sad,
That he's poison all he knows
And in one year, just let it go?

And all that time you were telling me
You were fine,
Silly man, you're a silly boy.

It's been you and me on this frontier
Trying not to be suburban pioneers.
Fightin' off the pavers
And the associations,
And the covenants against the trailers.

I remember how we use to laugh 
At all those rotten men in camo' drag-
With their advantage and their guns,
Up in the deer stand, shooting up a storm.

And all that time
You were telling me all those lies.
Silly man, I'm a silly girl.

You and me-
We used to hibernate like bears
And when we finally came up for air,
Everything's all marked and cleared,
Survey flags flying everywhere.

Once you told me what,
What I'll miss the most
Is just being the only ones-
With our dirt and our dead ends
And no one to turn us in.

Begs to be fed like a bed that beckons you, but you won't rest
Everyone's got a need to go
Most of us stick with our row to hoe
But not you, you're the black crow
With a straight line, and no time
For the birds of prey who wreck your nest

They set you on this course of your collision

I am a stop along your way
I am the words you'll never say
I crossed the great beyond of fear
I opened my eyes and saw us there, what a view
You went there too

Find the song in you that no one's heard
Strenghthen your wings as you sing your solo flight
Through this short life
Everyone's got a deep regret
We try to ground ourselves to forget
But your race to the end is neck and neck
You love them, you love them not

Twice your size steal your best
They set you on this course of your collision

I am a stop along your way

Opened my eyes and saw us there, what a view
And you went there too

But all along your chosen path are
Window panes and sheets of glass
That you won't see

Was the one that I wrote you in my heart
That never made it to the world

Indigo Girls,"When we tried to rework all of this
Each to her rendition
Painted ourselves in a corner
Lost for ideas blindly fishing
For a compliment or kindness
Just to bring us into view
But you could not interpret me and I could not interpret you

I remember that cold morning when the trees were black with birds
I tried to make out some connection 
We were at a loss for words
After all that we've been through
I could not see giving up
Despite the picture of our coffee growing colder in the cups

I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough
And I believe in you and I believe in love

So we went rolling on down through the years
Taking time off we could steal
Until the thief of things unreconciled
Stuck it's stick into the wheel
Now we're tumbling in a freefall
No one's gonna go unscathed
But it's not because you held back and its not how I behaved

I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough
I believe in you and I believe in love

There are avenues and supplements and books stacked on the shelf
Labyrinths of recovery in search of our best self
But most of what will happen now is way out of our hands
So just let it go and see where it lands

I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough

I do.

And when I'm drunk on the last drop of sadness about how we went wrong 
I'm gonna play this song 
Make some coffee black and strong 
Give thanks for healing time

And everyone's tied to their thing 
To their past or their drink or the date that they bring 
I just get tired all of sudden taking it in. 

And I want to lay my head down on you 

Because you're the only solid thing in this room 

A room full of changes, strangers, illusion, confusion, 
I speak from my heart but I'm not really sure if it's true. 
I wanna lay my head down on you.

Or you'll get rug ripped out 
And the only way you?ll be satisfied 
Is learning to live without. 
But some plan for the kingdom of heaven 
And some take their chances and bet lucky seven 
I don?t know what to believe, I just show up and breathe anymore. 

And I wanna lay my head down on you 
Because you're the only solid thing in this room 

A room full of dressers, professors, lookers, hookers 
If I don?t get out I'll do something I don?t wanna do. 

And I wanna lay my head down on you. 

Was it so long ago 
That we sat and talked in your car 
Your things were all packed 
And the place you were headed not really that far 
Years later I think 
That I would have been much more alive 
To have taken you up on your offer and taken that drive 

Oh well everything that?s come before us leads us to where we are now
And that's simple, I know so why can't I let go of the feeling 
That I'm lost somehow 
I'm just a ghost looking in 
Out of my own life just visiting 
In search of a body to have and to hold and to keep and to sleep. 

I wanna lay my head down on you 
Because you're the only solid thing in this room 
A room full of missed chance, slow dance, cold fate heartache 
I showed up for a party and saw my life story full view 

And I wanna lay my head down on you.

Where'd you come from? 

Daughter of my father's second cousin, 
Loyalties, I got em by the dozen. 
We share a past, we share a blood relation 
And that's as good as an invitation. 

Oh we oh oh little perennials 
Where'd you come from? 

I'm in the North Carolina Mountains, 
Just to the west of where I met my calling. 
If you look south to the foothills of these mountains rising, 
That's the place where it feels good falling. 
That's the place that I know. 

I look for words to fill the empty spaces, 
All the life revealed in these back stages. 
I reach for names like little puzzle pieces; 
Oh perennial, come to me. 

Oh we oh oh little perennials

",Little Perennials
Indigo Girls,"So money made you mean
And that's not how it's supposed to be.
You're ready to challenge and defend,
Yeah, but for all the wrong reasons.

How much do we really need?
A question, if you have to ask
Just means what it means-
The question that says everything.

Right and left it's all the same conspiracy
Just cause you ask, doesn't make a difference to me.

You could keep it all or give it away
But where did it come from in the first place?
Robbing Peter to pay me, and I'll just be
Giving it back to Peter to feel free.

Now you have to fix everything that's broke
Cause it'll never leave you alone.
Reinvent the wheel, be the butt of a joke,
Take the long road to charity.

Right or left it's all the same conspiracy
Robbing Peter to pay Paul
Or robbing Peter to pay me.
Robbing Peter to pay Paul
Or robbing Peter to pay me.

Yeah it's just too hard, oh well, jump in.

Cause now you're one, now you're one.

Indigo Girls,"I meet you for coffee
We get together periodically and 
I got a bad case I can't shake off of me
The fevered wanderin round wondering how it ought to be
You work in the system
You see possibilities and you're glistening
Eyes show the hell you're gonna give 'em
When they back off the mic for once and give it to a woman

I dream like a mad one
Brutal fantasies I catch as catch can
I'm a psychic and a laywoman
I see love and I like to make it happen
What we get from your war walk
The ticker of the nation breaking down like a bad clock
I want the pendulum to swing again
So that all your mighty mandate was just spitting in the wind

It doesn't come by the bullwhip
It's not persuaded with your hands on your hips
It's not the company of gunslingers
The epicenter love is the pendulum swinger
She is she is she is

It's fine about the old scroll Sanskrit
Gnostic gospels the da vinci code a smash hit
Aren't we dying just to read it and relate it
Too hard just to go by a blind faith
But they left out the sisters
I've been praying to a father god so long I really missed her
The goddess of benevolence
You should listen to your mama if you have a lick of sense left

Pushed under by the main press, buried under a code of dress
Relegated by the Vatican
But you can't keep a spirit down that wants to get up again

If we're a drop in the bucket
With just enough science to keep from saying fuck it
Until the last drop of sun burns its sweet light
Plenty revolutions left until we get this thing right

Indigo Girls,"It didn't happen for you,
No one wants to hear the truth,
Coming from three political queers.
Plucking the punk rock bloom.

So you break up the band
And leave us all in tow.
Now we gotta figure out
Where to go.

I caught it at a rave
Did it give you vaccination?
I saw it on my T.V.
Did it lighten up your load?
And every fuckin D.J.
Did you feel affilliated,
Is telling me I'm free.
Like you really had a home?

Free to be a loser
Were the ticket prices too high?
Free to be a trend
Were the lights too bright?
Free to be a backlash over and over again.
Was it all a bunch of hype?

You say, ""I'm losing inspiration,
One band at a time.
I gotta know there's someone, somewhere, out there singing for our side.""

Where I come up, we share the mortar and the glue.
And what we build together, we share that too.
And the wind may come, and the rain may fall,
But we stand together or we don't stand at all.
Where are you going to now,
Now that the goings gone?

So here's to your survival
And swimming up the stream,
Crossing over one dam after another
Until we get to Rock and Roll Heaven's gate.

Up deep burn all you leave behind you
You are the surface of my sun

I measure to what degree
I can shape up what?s been forged in me
The cooper penny hissing in the pool
So much for wishes so much for cooling 
Down this fire impossible desire

To open up my presents underneath the Christmas tree
With holly in the window the fireplace burning bright
The whole world is rejoicing on a Christmas night

There's lots of joy and happiness in the presents that we share
No other day can take its place throughout my memory

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer gladly leads the way
With joy they all are singing I hear them laugh and pray
Can't you feel the Christmas spirit on this special day

Indigo Girls,"In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,
In the bleak midwinter, long ago.

Our God, heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;
Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.

Enough for Him, Whom cherubim, worship night and day,
Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;
Enough for Him, Whom angels fall before,
The ox and ass and camel which adore.

Angels and archangels may have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;
But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,
Worshipped the beloved with a kiss.

What can I give Him, poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;
If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;
Yet what I can I give Him... 
Give my heart.",In The Bleak Midwinter

In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

With all our hearts we praise His holy name.

Indigo Girls,"I opened my hands up to see what I've got
My days slip like coins into a slot
They are gone 
The shadows lie long

I've been banking on a broken machine
Left unattended like most of my dreams
Rusted components of an unmarked song

We've been staring down a brilliant dream
The sun burns our eyes
We've been fighting for the love of our lives

All around us things come apart
Broken pieces broken hearts
Fix me oil me match me with the next best thing

Person to person nation to nation
Heels dug in no communication
While the time speaks of weathering

We've been wanting to be helped by binding ties
We've been fighting for the love of our lives

And when it breaks down I beg you don't go
A sinking ship I'm ready to blow
I try to outthink you with an army of words
I strategize
I am fighting for the love of my life

Fire and water oxygen
Scotch and soda or any combination
Starts the reaction

Is there no mastermind of modern day
Who can blueprint a plan to make love stay
steady and weatherproof usher in a new revolution?

After trying more the hopeful ones still try
How can we help it
When we're fighting for the love of our live?

Indigo Girls,"I've come a long way
I was a show on ice
Dazzling and brittle
But subject to the sun

And then one day
I went little by little
Back to the water
The place where I'd come from

And I went under
Like stones tied in a sack
And I got emptied
And started my way back

My name
It's got your name on it
My shame
It's got your name on it
My home
It's got your name on it
Everything I own

And all my schemes drowned at the seams
Have left me fine in my own skin
I've come a long way
Just to begin

I've come a long way
Under the cover of darkness
Trusting a stranger
A boatman at the shore

The scourge of hope
The ugly face of danger
The keepers of the keys
Had me down on my knees
In front of the gilded doors

And in a world where every ax was poised to grind
To find my peace I only held up what was already mine

My name
It's got your name on it
My shame
It's got your name on it
My home
It's got your name on it
Everything I own

And all my swords have turned to words that blow like poems in the wind
I've come a long way

I used to be twisted
When you called it an opiate
A simple way to cope
And yet I think you shouldn't skip if you haven't worn the shoes

They start out tight
And then they hurt your tired feet at night
But then they give a little day by day
And then before you know it
You look back and you've come a long way

It's got your name on it
My shame
It's got your name on it
My home
It's got your name on it
Everything I own

You call my name
My name
You call my name
My shame
You call my name
My home
Everything I own
You call my name

If it's got my name, it's got your name on it
Everything I own has got your name on it
When I was trying to cross the river
You were at the river getting me across and now
Everything, everything I own
Has got your name on it
Oh everything
I've got your name on it",Come A Long Way

I am the better man
When I look to leave her
I always stagger back again

Once I built an ivory tower
So I could worship from above
And when I climbed down
To be set free, she took me in again

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

When she comes to greet me
She is mercy at my feet
When I see her pin her charm
She just throws it back again

Once I sought an early grave
To find a better land
She just smiled and laughed at me
And took her blues back again

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

She is comfort by my side
When I try to understand
She just opens up her eyes

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

Once I stood to lose her
When I saw what I had done
Bound down and flew away the hours
Of her garden and her sun

So I tried to warn her
I'll turn to see her weep
40 days and 40 nights
And it's still coming down on me

Fresh out the whome, 1973
A baby boy, I'm ready for war
Now this just can't be
Wit my daddy
He don't love us, just too young to know
I love you mama, work real hard
It got us out the ghetto
No more dependin' on my mama
See I'm a cra... man
And I got kids of my own
But if I call she there
Somehow, someway
Indo gone shine like diamonds
Imortalize to my rise dodgin' demons and phantoms
Realize your situation, ain't gettin' no better
They building more and more prisons
I wrote my nation a letter
Conversation and hation
I talked to god last night
Like from last saw 6 phantom
And I'ma lie in twilight
Zonin', think I'm gonin'
Maybe bro hoe
Was I talkin' on that level
Crusafix on my door
Race em', rece em', racin'
got my heart pacin'
Listne learn it's my turn

Let me kick in the loot
I'm tellin' heavy understand me, baby this Gangsta Boo
Now all you wannabe's
Claimin' platnum LP's
I can't believe all you fakers in the rap industry
You stay at home at your moms house
Stackin' your cheese
Whatever punk, I'm on my own
Still stackin' g's
I'm young in ages
Only the hair trick, I've been everywhere
I'm takin' flights to NY
Lookin' for somethin' to wear
I don't be carin' what you say
I'm hypnotized for your mind
I state it fly
Sippin' wine
Wit my 6's behind
Call up Chris
I'm in crystal
What you got for me baby

Range Rover we're reelin'
X-O through the door
Cause we got plenty more
We be the one with the flow
Hurtn' all I fall

We killin' each other for colors and lovers and others
We can talk a long time
Smoke a blunt and touch faces
rull laces, talk, pimp, and no slippin' and take it
To upper places
Like do you have a strong mind
What's your purpose in life
Begin it to end in my potion, I'm steady coastin'
Bustas look me in my eye
Turn around and throw crosses
Talkin' shit, your jealous bustas come and go like my (??)
Toss and turn, and burn and yurnin' for freedom in my sleep
I'm bout' to lose my mind
But them angels watchin' over me
Three strikes and now your gone
To the penetentiary
WOrd is born, they won't capture me
I'm on a mission, I'm wishin'
Up on a star
Workin' on a meal ticket
While I'm eatin' caviar
I lie please
Bless my soul on my journey through hell
I know my bothers my keeper
My brother got a street sweeper
We gonna blast these devils
I know you comin' to get me
But when I die, I'm takin' six of ya'll wit me

Et je suce ton pouce et tes taches de rousseur
A travers les caresses

Gare a toi, gare a moi

Apesar de eu ser patrão
Eu tinha no coração
O amigo Chico Mineiro
Caboclo bom decidido
Na viola era dolorido e era o peão dos boiadeiro

Hoje porém com tristeza
Recordando das proeza
Da nossa viage motin

Viajemo mais de dez anos
Vendendo boiada e comprando
Por esse rincão sem fim

Caboclo de nada temia
Mas porém, chegou um dia
Que Chico apartou-se de mim

Fizemos a última viagem
Foi lá pro sertão de Goiás
Fui eu e o Chico Mineiro
Também foi o capataz

Viajamos muitos dias
Pra chegar em Ouro Fino
Aonde nós passemo a noite
Numa festa do Divino

A festa tava tão boa
Mas antes não tivesse ido
O Chico foi baleado
Por um homem desconhecido

Larguei de comprar boiada
Mataram meu companheiro
Acabou-se o som da viola
Acabou-se o Chico Mineiro

Despois daquela tragédia
Fiquei mais aborrecido
Não sabia da nossa amizade
Porque nois dois era unido

Quando vi seu documento
Me cortou meu coração
Vim saber que o Chico Mineiro
Era meu legítimo irmão",Chico Mineiro

I fell in love with a blue eyed girl

Her kiss was warm, her touch was tender

The sweetest one in all the world

At night I dream about her

In my dreams, she holds me tight

and when the clouds roll in at twilight

I sit and dream of a starry night

Then one day down in Virginia
My blue eyed girl she went away
I miss her love, I miss her Kisses
I'll always mourn that cloudy day

Truthfully, if you tellin' people that you doin' me
Then you tellin' me that you don't even want to screw with me
And that's a shame
I can't even do my thang
You get dick, and you go temporarily insane
You think it's a game, but I don't want to play no more
You want to stay, but you can't stay no more
You want to be with K, but that ain't okay no more

I'm a tell your ass now, baby, truthfully
I ain't told nobody that you doin' me

It seem like fine hos is hard to find mostly
The type of girls that give you their whereabouts supposedly
And when you check, they ain't never where they're supposed to be
I learned my lesson; now I only fuck hos that's close to me
Don't get me wrong; you still gotta live close to me
This ain't a song I made for ugly hos to start approachin' me
You know how this go; I diss hos
I'm very mean now
My roley face green now
I bring your self esteem down

I knew since the day I met you if I would fuck you or not
So later on I asked my girl how many bitches you got
I never loved you a lot, but then this nigga got turned out
He told his boy that told his boy, and now the word's out
My man approachin' me with rumors that he heard about

But dude a lame
He probably asked you can he work it out?

I swear, y'all, betta keep the game on 'em
Yeah, y'all, now watch me change on 'em
Rule one: never tell your nigga who you fucked
And always smile back if he tell you he in love
Rule two: most men try to control you
Take my advice, 'cause it's so true what women go through
And rule three: you thinkin' he don't cheat and he committed?
He still get invitations from the last girl he been with
Bet his ho be mad; I bet she tell you that he hit it
Just check inside his pocket; find another bitches digits

I swear to God, baby, it should be you and me

Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'
These girls out here be thinkin' they caught up and shit
Fuck that; spend that nigga, yo; you know what I'm sayin'
You catch yourself up; you go to him

It's going down, West Coast
A toast to the Coast, West Coast!
I got my nigga Mack 10 up in the house from the Westside Connection
My nigga Deadly Threat from the L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, D.P.G, West Coast finest
Here's a toast to the coast!

What have we? - a house full of Cavi, no stress
Well known riders from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes licking up, so hard we're sticking up
How could the East Coast win; when the West Coast is clicking up?
So please, no set tripping about Cs and Bs
It's the Westside connected with the D.P.G.s
For the cheese we're jab with the gift of the gab always capping
Mack 10 and Snoop rapping, now how does that happen?
It's all good, fool, so peep game if you could
Snoop be from Long Beach, and I be from Inglewood
So now you despise, cause it came to your surprise
Two well known enemies now becoming allies
In Californ-I-A; we parley the G way
Some wear red and black, and some sport (Blue and Grey!)
But gangsters don't dance, we hang-boogie and bang
So it's the Westside connected with the Dogg Pound Gang

We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
Party people, party people, do you wanna get funky?
Get down, get down, you know

Up jump the boogie, so I've jumped up with it
We smoke weed by the ounce, no hit it
It's a party, Bombay and Bacardi, O.E. and Hennessy
We're all heated just in case, any of my enemies slipped in
Tripped in, you don't wanna own a casket this soon
Get at the bitches, nigga, bump to the boom
The ladies love me cause I love myself
I'm like an age, by no wine in time you'll find
I'm at the top of the shelf
So when you ready and you're cracking a sip
Strip, trip, slide around your house in your slippers
Bump the rap tunes that's as cold as the Whispers
Fantastic, brand new in this classic
We done mellowed out but you still get your ass kicked
It's Mr. Bad Azz, I rock microphones right
West Coast, East Side, for life!

It ain't no need for the fronting black, between me and you
Reality bites, so I'ma keep it real with my crew
I'm dangerous like Michael Dew
My life cycle completes the last stages
I'm more, I'm through, definitely gauges is outrageous
Cause I was born to rock the party
Oh! now you're Mister Smarty because we got the show started!
I'm cold-hearted, and won't stop what I'm revealing
Leave it up to the West to have them dancing on the ceiling
And I'm feeling, that Vibe that represents the East
I attack like a pack, to make them burn like grease
So let the nonsense cease, and hold my piece in case
Reel-to-reel come to deal, I have to give them a taste
I serve face to face, rhymes define by Tech
Versatile style done switched up to wreck your whole set

That's real, you know
It's getting kind funky here man, uh

Mack 10 is the lick, Dogg Pound is the clique
I can't get enough of this gangster shit
My name ain't +Jeru+ and I ain't out to +Dama-ja+
But when on the mic, emcees, to me, they're all amateurs
See the opponents, disassemble the components
Disassemble the opponents, then disappear in a moment
In a blink's time, I take time in the doorway to crime
With a criminal mind, the raw kind
Microphones used so abusively
You can't fuck with the K-U-R-U-P-T
And in the mixture, painted clearer than a picture of a psycho
I'm suicidal, split shit to cause a twister
And get you twisted, you're fucking with the unlisted
To be specific, niggas ain't being realistic
I ain't impressed, you're about to get your chest test
In the west, where it's about your money and your set

You East Coast niggas flow like the home grown grow
Zoo got the flavor, every color for the rainbow
Dream, on out far, pass the stars
Your styles ain't doper than ours
Hard to the core, hit it one time, hit it some more
Y'all spit but that West Coast shit is out doors
Wild like Ninety Days in the cage
Cold like the Everglades, and never fades
Me, C to the Z to the T
Beef? Bet' not let me catch you in the streets

No more, no more, no more I will get hurt, cause
Back in the jungle a man was free
Free from fear, from urban captivity, cause
No where a color, we heard that too
Brother got as sick as you
Runing trough his face, just like the ocean
So they won't admit that, so take caution
Coz the enemy just want to separate
The human race, so there ain't no time to debate
Start taking care of yourself, find your soul
And that's an individual that you find your course HU!
Start to use your mind for the people
Cause this is the food that makes us evil
Disagree, the proof will show it's red
And the truth to turn from the shame

Shoot the racist and the area turns red
Shoot the racist and the area turns red
Shoot the racist and the area turns red
Shoot -shoot-and the area turns red

I pick up with the dance, and the people drop dead
Cause the area turns red
Follow me, coz we said and they said
That the area turn red
Come and dance with the people that
Uh- follow me -uh

Load them at your pleasure.
These are the dusty pictures that I found
While on my search for treasure.

Here is the hazy vision that I saw,
Here's what she said to me:
For a scientist I am too raw
I know all about you can't you see?

She said don't be making no provocation
Unless you're ready to handle the nation
I'm cold and I'm bold and I don't do what I'm told.

She wore mirrorshades.
And I can't explain the thing about her mirrorshades.
But I know that I can't live without her mirrorshades.
And I kind of lose my mind about her mirrorshades.
And the strange attractors that surround her.

Remember as you bust north at her call,
That you can never doubt it.
No matter what you cannot have it all,
'cause she leaves home without it.

But in the darkness where we both were caught,
In the heartbeat of El Nido.
I had a vhs for her to slot
And now I never want to go.

She said ""Now you're here, you've got to show and prove,
And do that dance until it don't move.
The phone doesn't work so you won't be calling home.""

She wore mirrorshades.
And I can't explain the thing about her mirrorshades.
But I know that I can't live without her mirrorshades.
And I kind of lose my mind about her mirrorshades.
And the strange attractors that surround her.

She was so absolutely digital,
To jack in now was wrong.
But Cupid punches deck with chemicals
While Dark Madonna sings her song. 

She wore mirrorshades.
And I can't explain the thing about her mirrorshades.
But I know that I can't live without her mirrorshades.

Of mind of body and soul in time to the pulse of your blood and breath in the neck of the world and all that mother nature can hold and give and love and feel
Don't you get my drift
Did you get the pack
Did you get the set 
Did you get the joke
Did you get the outcome
My stuff's bigger than your stuff 
Sit back down
Try get your head together
Optimist, did you read that eye towers seizing every second more so every second burning bright lighting the road ahead stepping down the path of many feared
A tread beam lead by the higher mind who will find
That sometimes its best to leave the past behind 
Why cry at the moon for what was lost
Too soon the things you didn't do all the forgotten tunes
You gotta remember that everything you own ain't everything you are
This is the third trip in the back of your car filled with memories flashing by like liquid sky
Like electric stars that define everything that we are
I'm getting hypnotized
I've come too far, I was trying too hard now everything keeps shifting in and out of time

Lets venture forth into the unknown
Heads bursting with light blazing through the uncharted streets write our names
Fifty feet high in the minds of all the people we meet
Draw a Halo around your head where god looks down and blesses the genetics of red roof tiles, golden gates, emerald isles and the lands where the sun is slowly rising

Let's dance tonight beneath the Milky Way
Some won't make it back but that's ok
This is a moment that can't be missed so it's worth the risk
Touching the bullets of a silicone century 
Nothing now can sully the sound of a drummers beating 
The humidity from the sky
For the love
For the beat of the rush of future is ours
Its coming
The future is bright.
