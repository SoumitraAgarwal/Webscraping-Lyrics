Max Pezzali,"Musica che spacca in due stomaco e cervello
fuori ha smesso o piove ancora io non ho l'ombrello
e tu balli balli balli ballano le gambe
infilate in un collant o in un autoreggente
quel vestito nero che ti avvolge stretto
tanto tanto stretto che si vede quasi tutto
il condizionatore ti respira vicino
ed il freddo fa apparire qualche cosa sul tuo seno
Lasciati toccare fa sentire cosa c'è
Lasciati slacciare sei una libidine
Lasciati toccare fa sentire cosa c'è
Lasciati toccare sei una libidine
Luci stroboscopiche ti vedo non ti vedo
curve che si muovono mi siedo se no cado
le tue unghie rosse cercano il pacchetto
dentro nella borsa tra la cipria ed il rossetto
poi ne sfili una l'accendi piano piano
chiudi gli occhi un attimo avvolta da quel fumo
tutti qui ti osservano ma non vedi nessuno
guardi un po' la gonna e poi l'accarezzi con la mano
Lasciati toccare fa sentire cosa c'è
Lasciati slacciare sei una libidine
Lasciati toccare fa sentire cosa c'è
Lasciati toccare sei una libidine",Lasciati Toccare [2012]
Max Pezzali,"Quando torni a casa alle sei
Come una ninja fai le scale
Entri con passo felpato ma poi
Accende la luce e lei ti assale

S'inkazza, s'inkazza
S'inkazza, s'inkazza

Questa casa non è un albergo
Per fare quello che vuoi
Non ne possiamo più io ti avverto
Dei porci comodi tuoi

Quando ti fai troppe docce
Quando proprio non ne fai
Quando lasci le mutande in giro
Quando il lesso non lo vuoi
S'inkazza, s'inkazza
S'inkazza, s'inkazza
S'inkazza, s'inkazza
S'inkazza, s'inkazza

Questa casa non è un albergo
Lo dice anche papà
Tu te ne freghi non hai rispetto
E neanche la dignità

Quando ti alzi a mezzogiorno
Quando a casa non sei mai
Quando invece ci stai sempre
Devo pulire te ne vai
S'inkazza, s'inkazza
S'inkazza, s'inkazza

Max Pezzali,"Tu ti vesti da fotomodella
di quelle di Vogue tu ti credi più bella
passi le ore allo specchio nel bagno
trucco indelebile il tuo grande sogno
credi di essere intelligente
anche se parli da vera demente
perché impegnandoti al massimo riesci
a dire se toro sta bene coi pesci
cammini cammini cammini mini
facevi prima ad uscire in bikini
si vede tutto di tutto di più
e tu che tiri la gonna più su
però tu vuoi fare la donna all'antica
quella che ti fa vedere la ""house""
ma poi si tira indietro non voglio
prima do un occhio al tuo portafoglio
te la tiri
te la tiri
te la tiri
te la tiri
Con quel profumo pesante da Dio
che metti su a litri lo proverò anch'io
per farti vedere che cosa si sente
che fa quasi male
che impesta l'ambiente
quando ti passa vicino una donna
con che disprezzo le guardi la gonna
oddio che gambe che trucco è dipinta
e poi che seno io porto la quinta
in un mondo di cessi sei l'unica bella
ti credi grande una diva una stella
quando ci guardi dall'alto dei tacchi
lo sai che sappiamo che tu tiri pacchi
perché in effetti nessuno ti caga
sei troppo tesa fai troppo la figa
anche se poi veramente lo ammetto
quando tu provochi sai fare effetto
te la tiri
te la tiri
te la tiri
te la tiri
Quando vuoi fare la fuori di testa
fingi di bere comincia la festa
ridi da oca sculetti di brutto
e tutti che pensano adesso mi butto
ma il due di picche è sempre in agguato
e tu scendi in pista col passo felpato
balli in un modo che non c'entra niente
perché vuoi soltanto arrapare la gente
tu punti solo quei tipi importanti
soldi pochissimi debiti tanti
solo che sanno colpire nel segno
e tu che ci caschi nel loro disegno
passano a prenderti con l'ammiraglia
cenetta con aragosta e tenaglia
quando alla fine li hai conosciuti
ti portano a letto e poi tanti saluti
te la tiri
te la tiri
te la tiri
te la tiri",Te la Tiri [2012]
Max Pezzali,"Figlio mio questa storia è una storia di gente come noi
Che si alzava ogni mattina senza lamentarsi mai
Persone semplici che lavoravano duro solamente per
Un futuro per I figli e un pò di serenità per se
E figlio mio questa storia è la storia di quello che è successo poi
Della corsa all'oro
Che però l'oro nessuno ha visto mai
Da quando sono arrivati in città avventurieri e businessmen
Che si son presi tutto quanto anche le briciole

Questa città una volta era un posto bellissimo
Pieno di ragazze profumate che ballavano
Fino all'alba e regalavano gioia di vivere
E voglia di sorridere
Però sai che I cowboy non mollano
Se gli spari poi si rialzano
Il destino può rallentarli però
I cowboy non mollano

Figlio mio questa storia è la storia di questi tempi bui
Di balordi che vengono giù in città a cercare guai
E whiskey e donne facili e risse nei salono e slot machine
Fino all'ultimo centesimo a bruciarsi il venerdì

E figlio mio questa storia è una storia di uomini del west
Di ciarlatani e imbonitori in giro a vendere
Pozioni miracolose che curano ogni disturbo e malattia
Dalla caduta dei capelli al crollo dell'economia
Questa città sarà ancora un posto bellissimo
Pieno di ragazze profumate che ballano
Fino all'alba regalando gioia di vivere
Le guarderai sorridere
Perché sai che I cowboy non mollano
Se gli spari poi si rialzano
Il destino può rallentarli però
I cowboy non mollano
Figlio mio questa storia è la storia
delle storie a cui non crederai
Quando te le racconteranno come han fatto con noi
Farai un cenno con la testa come per dirgli che ci stai
Ma poi monterai in sella come fa un vero cowboy

Perché sai che I cowboy non mollano
Se gli spari poi si rialzano
Il destino può rallentarli però
I cowboy non mollano
Perché sai che I cowboy non mollano
Quando cadono si rialzano
Il destino può fargli male però
I cowboy non mollano",I cowboy non mollano
Max Pezzali,"Ti ho incontrata ma tu non mi hai visto
Eri in macchina è stato un attimo
Ma il mio cuore si è come bloccato
O era fermo prima e, ha ripreso a battere
Tante volte io l’ho immaginato
Rivedere te che effetto mi farà
Però adesso che è capitato
Non importa più se sia, stata colpa tua o mia

Eravamo quel che tutti sognano quell’amore
Che i cantanti cantano
Tanto forte, potente, immenso che
Sembra esagerato e impossibile
Con il petto che sembra esplodere
Che non serve altro in più per vivere
Che potrebbe scomparire l’Universo
Tranne noi, tranne noi

I ricordi che sembrano lame
Fanno male ma Forse li cerco
Io per rivivere per ricordare
Ogni istante accanto a te
Una vita accanto a te
E il cervello sa che è complicato
Ciò che è rotto ormai non si riparerà
Però il cuore, sai, me l’ha giurato
Sa che un giorno tornerai
Sì
Dice presto tornerai

E saremo quel che tutti sognano quell’amore
Che i cantanti cantano
Tanto forte, potente, immenso che
Sembra esagerato e impossibile
Con il petto che sembra esplodere
Che non serve altro più per vivere
Che non c’è parola per descrivere
Che non ti sceglie e che non si fa scegliere
E saremo quel che tutti cercano
Quell’amore che i cantanti cantano
Tanto forte, potente, immenso che
Sembra esagerato e irrealizzabile
E che il petto fa quasi esplodere
Senza il quale non si può più vivere
Che potrebbe scomparire l’Universo
Tranne noi
Tranne noi.",L'universo tranne noi
Max Pezzali,"L'uomo nell'altra macchina ha
Una faccia che già ho capito
Non mi farà passare
Che piuttosto preferisce morire
Che concedere un centimetro a me

Quattro gocce ed è sempre così
Siamo bloccati qui
A guardare le lancette girare
Per non diventare matti, sognare
E scappare di non tornare mai più

Grazie a Dio è venerdì e
Grazie a Dio sei qui
E cacceremo via i pensieri
Torneranno lunedì ma non pensiamoci
E godiamoci ogni istante

Guardo il tergicristallo che va
Corre di qua e di là ogni volta
Cancellare la pioggia
Ma ogni volta viene giù un'altra goccia
Poi altre mille finché ripasserà

Forse siamo anche noi come lui
Non ci fermiamo mai
Ma poi il vetro si continua a bagnare
Quello dietro ha cominciato a suonare
Metto in prima sennò mi ucciderà

Grazie a Dio è venerdì
E grazie a Dio sei qui
E cacceremo via i pensieri
Torneranno lunedì ma non pensiamoci
E godiamoci ogni istante

Mi apro un Chiringuito in spiaggia al sole dei tropici
Ed io saluto non cercatemi, sì

Grazie a Dio è venerdì
E grazie a Dio sei qui
E cacceremo via i pensieri
Torneranno lunedì ma non pensiamoci

Max Pezzali,"Non ci sarà mai più un giorno
Mai più un giorno inutile
Senza dirti grazie
Per avermi fatto vivere
Il tuo nome
Il tuo nome scriverò
Sul mio cuore così so
Che non potrò perderlo
 
Lascerò che le emozioni
Mi trasportino da te
Come un fiume lento
Ma che tutto può travolgere
Il tuo nome
Il tuo nome canterò
Finché voce non avrò
Più né fiato in gola
 
I fiori nel deserto
A volte nascono
Pensavo non fosse così
Ed invece vedi
 
I fiori nel deserto
A volte sbocciano
Sconfiggono sabbia
E polvere
 
Nulla potrà il tempo
E nulla potrà l'abitudine
La tua mano nella mia vincerà
Pioggia e grandine
Il tuo nome
Il tuo nome suonerà
Con ogni sua sillaba
La più dolce musica
 
Sotto luci colorate
Balleremo immobili
Mentre il mondo sarà in festa
Anche solo guardandoci
Il tuo nome
Il tuo nome esploderà
Scritto su una nuvola
Per la vita intera
 
I fiori nel deserto
A volte nascono
Pensavo non fosse così

Max Pezzali,"Suona in lontananza
Un allarme che poi si sa
Che non serve a niente
Tanto nessuno controllerà
Serve ad azzerare
Ogni mia probabilità
Di prendere sonno
In questa notte che mi stritola

Non dormirò mai più
In questo letto mi manchi tu
Non dormirò ormai
Arriva l'alba tra un po'
L'alba tra un po'

Sopravviverai
(Però sarò stanco)
Anche questa volta

Sì però non insistere
(Altro sbattimento)
Lascia perdere
(Altro tempo tempo)

Devo respirare
Col diaframma perché così
Pare si rilassino
Perfettamente I muscoli
Abbassare l'ansia
E pensare a qualcosa che
Mi ricordi dei momenti belli
È ovvio, esclusa te

Non dormirò mai più
In questo letto mi manchi tu
Non dormirò ormai
Arriva l'alba tra un po'

Non partirò mai più
In questa estate mi manchi tu
Non partirò ormai

Max Pezzali,"Alcuni vengono qui solo per vederti
Mentre con il vassoio pieno tu vai 
Si fingono indecisi solo per poterti
Chiedere che cocktail gli consiglierai

Ma il cuore non cederà, non cederà ma  

Superstar  in questo posto tu sei l’unica superstar 
E scivoli tra I tavoli da superstar 
Sorridi a tutti però poi di confidenza non ne dai 

Tu balli e canti una canzone che ti piace 
E non ti importa di cosa penserà
La gente anche se il tuo corpo e la tua voce
Fanno ancora più effetto a tutti I tuoi fans

È come se ci fosse sempre un faro che ti illumina 
Come un sipario è scesa la saracinesca 
Saluti tutti e poi scomparirai

Sperando che sta volta lo noterai 

Ma tu non vedi  tu sei lontana

Max Pezzali,"Tu non ascoltare le cose che non servono 
Se c’è una verità la sappiamo solo noi 
Queste cose si sanno solo se si vivono 
Ciò che porti dentro non si dimentica 
Mentre passa il tempo anche delusioni e lacrime 
Perdono colore  e poi si dissolvono 
Butta giù quel muro da me, non ti difendere 
Che ragione e rabbia non sempre vincono

Tu ricorderai le serate a non pensare 
E rimpiangerai in un pensiero per tornare 
E se non capirai ricorda che si può cambiare 
Lo diresti mai che proprio noi

Non lo so 
Nel mio viaggio dove arriverò 
Non lo so 
Per la strada che cosa troverò 
Però so 
Che da dentro al mio cuore 
Non si riesce a scappare 
Sarai in ogni pensiero che avrò

I momenti belli sono anche i più difficili 
Quando fanno perdere la lucidità 
Mi dovrai pagare se tu vorrai convincermi 
Che non era vera quella felicità

E ti ritroverai alle serate in riva al mare 
E non scorderai perché ti chiamavo amore

Max Prosa,"Reiß' die Leinen, es ist besser 
Wenn am Ende keiner lacht 
Früher hast du mich geküsst 
Jetzt hab ich's mir dazu gedacht 
Du fantasierst und wirfst noch immer 
Bunte Blicke durch die Welt
Früher hast du mich begeistert
Jetzt hab' ich mich blind gestellt

Und als der Sturm vorbei war
Hab' ich die Sonne wieder gesehen
Es hätt' ja klappen können
Mit uns, mit uns
Und als der Sturm vorbei war
Hab' ich die Sonne wieder gesehen
Es hätte klappen können
Mit uns

Werf' die Worte aus dem Fenster
Wofür soll das alles sein
Früher schien uns diese Frage
So bedeutungslos und klein
Und trag die Tränen durch den Regen
Weil hier ist eh schon alles nass
Früher waren deine Augen traurig
Jetzt sind sie kalt, weißt du das

Und weißt du 
Als der Sturm vorbei war
Hab' ich die Sonne wieder gesehen

Max Prosa,"Tief im Gefängnis der Welt sind wir gefangen und ahnen es nicht
Die Mauern, man kann sie nicht sehen, nur immer fühlen
Sie stehen so dicht
Du merkst doch, dass irgendwas quält,
Weil immer irgendwas fehlt, aber was
Tief in versunkener Nacht weckt es Leute
Und hält sie dann wach

Und wenn ich könnt flög ich davon
Mit meinen Flügeln aus Beton
Und wär die Schwerkraft nicht
Dann fänd ich dich
Wo auch immer du jetzt bist
Und mich auf deine Art vermisst

Tief im Gefängnis der Welt
Rebellier ich und weiß nicht wozu
Vertraute Gesichter im Licht

Dann fänd ich dich
Wo auch immer du jetzt bist

Oh, vermisst
Und nie vergisst
So sehr, so sehr vermisst

Aber niemand kann davon
Denn das sind Flügel aus Beton
Und wär die Schwerkraft nicht
Dann fänd ich dich

Und mich auf deine Art vermisst

Der Raum ist leer und kalt.
Schon tragen mich die alten Träume fort.
Da lauf ich durch die Straßen,
Treff immer wieder sie
In der Croissanterie,
C’est la vie.

Es ist genau wie damals, als es begann,
Ein glühender Funke sprang,
Die kurze Zeit war Ewigkeit.
Ich denk an ihre Augen,
Die nicht vergehen,
Und was sie jetzt wohl sehen,
Oder wen?

Oh, sie nahm Abschied
Und zog weiter,
Als ich schlief.
Bei mir blieben
All die Geister,
Die sie rief.

Es war an einem Sonntag in Tel Aviv,
Als sie dann mit mir schlief,
Brach es aus den Wolken, ich war frei.
Sie sprach nie von der Zukunft,
Sie las mir vor,
Ihr Mund an meinem Ohr.

Sattere und Grimms Märchen und ihr Tagebuch,
Ein Satz klang wie ein Fluch
Der Abschied bringt das Glück über die Zeit.
Ich lieg' in meinem Zimmer,
'Ne Tür schlägt zu,
Ich finde keine Ruh'.

Oh, sie nahm Abschied
Und zog weiter,
Als ich schlief.
Bei mir blieben
All die Geister,
Die sie rief.
Sie ließ mich alleine
Mit den Geistern,

Max Prosa,"Am Ende meiner Straße,
Da ist das Café Noir.
Man sagt, dass das vor Jahren mal
Ein alter Bahnhof war.
Am Eingang sitzt Napoléon
Und lallt: „Die Welt ist mein!“
Er schnorrt ’ne Zigarette, es darf auch Kleingeld sein.
Sonst schimpft er wie ein Rohrspatz und lispelt sonderbar
’S ist geschlossene Gesellschaft heute Nacht im Café Noir.

Philosophen und Poeten,
Die niemand sonst versteht,
Und all die, die nie wissen,
Wie es morgen weitergeht,
Sie rauchen, reden, trinken
Hier an der langen Bar,
Sind Heilige Halunken hier im alten Café Noir.
Der eine vierteilt Bierdeckel nur mit ’nem Fingertwist.
Sein Bild war in der Zeitung, dort galt er als vermisst.

Und hier an meiner Schulter
Lehnt ein ewiger Student,
Der sagt, er hätt’ heut’ absichtlich
Sein Staatsexamen verpennt.
Er musste sich entscheiden,
Will lieber Spieler sein,
Er setzt auf eine Karte,
Gewinnt, und lädt uns ein.
Er trinkt auf Paragraphen, und auf die, die sie verdrehen
Und auf ’ne goldene Zukunft, ihr werdet es schon sehen!

Und da hinten dieser Vogel,
Der tanzt für Schnaps und Geld,
Sieht aus wie Charlie Manson,
Der pfeift auf diese Welt.
Und da kommt Pater Jakob,
Er teilt mit ihm sein Bier
Und ruft „Im Himmel gibt es keins,
Da bleib ich lieber hier.“
Ah, das sind Gespenster, längst Teil vom Inventar,
Sie rasseln mit den Ketten wie der Geist des Café Noirs.

Und Romeo sitzt einsam
Vor seinem sechsten Bier.
Er weiß, die schöne Julia
Hat Spätschicht bis halb vier.
Er glaubt, er wäre Shakespeare
Und er schreibt ihr ein Sonett,
Sie nimmt es an wie Rosen,
Und sagt: „Du bist wirklich nett.“
Doch hat sie’s nie gelesen, denn sie liebt nur Captain Flint
Oder auch kräftige Matrosen, die hier gestrandet sind.

Selbst Bob, der alte Riese
Sitzt hier rücklings an der Bar
Und spielt so unermüdlich
Die Mundharmonika.
Und allen, die ihm sagen,
Wie angetan sie sind,
Entgegnet er gelangweilt,
Geh raus, erzähl’s dem Wind!
Als wir noch in den Sternen lagen, war er schon längst da
Und bastelte die Jukebox hier im alten Café Noir.

Jetzt steh ich hier und singe
Und finde keine Ruh’,
Ich seh’ Gesichter, die verschwimmen,
Dann bist da plötzlich Du!

Na komm schon, setz’ dich zu uns,
Und tu Dir bloß nicht leid.
Wir sind nicht wirklich böse,
Wir töten nur die Zeit.
Wir stellen auch keine Fragen, wir sind nur einfach da
Und für einander Zuflucht hier im alten Café Noir.",Café Noir
Max Prosa,"Hier steh ich, ihr kennt mich schon, des Chaos geliebter Sohn.
Vor euch, die ihr Strippen zieht und dann vor dem Elend flieht.
Vor euch, die ihr spüren lasst, wie sehr ihr euch selber hasst.

Hier steh ich, ihr kennt mich schon, des Chaos geliebter Sohn.
Ich weiß, dass die heile Welt selten Versprechen hält.
Es tobt unser alter Streit seit einer Ewigkeit.
Ich leb' in der Resistance und nutzte die letzte Chance.

Und ich sag es laut, oh, ich sag es laut
Die Zukunft ist verbaut,
Die Erde ausgeraubt, wohin man auch schaut.
Unser Erbe wiegt tausend Jahre schwer,
Der Plastikmüll treibt als Mahnmal im Meer.

Hier steh ich, ihr kennt mich schon, des Chaos geliebter Sohn.
Ich weiß, dass die heile Welt selten Versprechen hält.
Doch bis die Wahrheit, wie das Licht, durch alle Risse bricht,
Steh ich immer wieder hier, seit sicher ihr hört von mir.

Und ich seh' das Blut auf eurem Jackett, über'm Schweinefett,
Es geht nicht mehr weg, es geht nie mehr weg!
Ihr, die unentwegt nur im Luxus lebt, die Befehle gebt
Bis die Erde bebt, oh, die Erde bebt.
Euer Kampfpilot bringt den Feuertod, hundert Menschen tot,
Tausend Menschen tot, esst Kuchen statt Brot!

Max Prosa,"Charlie ist ein Straßenkind, das trotzig Weihnachtslieder singt,
In der U-Bahn-Sommernacht, Sommernacht, U-Bahnschacht.

Charlie, das sind schwule Jungs, und sie zeigen’s Hinz und Kunz
Mit ’nem zarten Zungenkuss, Zungenkuss, nachts im Bus.

Charlie ist der Feind für euch, weil er ne andre Wahrheit kennt
Wer wirft den ersten Stein auf diesen heiligen Moment?
Gefangen in dem Netz der Lüge, das ihr webt,
Hungert ihr nach Leben und kreuzigt den, der lebt.

Charlie sind die Farbigen, die vor grauen Mauern pennen,
Doch ihr Lächeln leuchtet hell, leuchtet hell, ah so grell.

Charlie, das sind Du und ich, doch sie begreifen’s einfach nicht
Diesen tiefen Augenblick, tiefen Blick, so ein Kick!

Max Prosa,"Die Vorstellung beginnt,
Im Herzen sind wir Kind.
Der Kopf spielt Akrobat,
Wünscht sich viel Applaus,
Macht ’n Salto und rutscht aus.

Wenn Dompteure Peitschen schwingen.
Schwindler sitzen auf dem Thron
Und jede Bestie, die’s erkennt,
Wartet auf ihren Moment.",Der Clown

Egal wo wir sind,
Nichts macht mehr was aus.

Du hältst mich,
Wir sind vereint,
Wo immer der Mond heut’ scheint.

Steinig, neblig war der weite Weg, doch mich hat es niemals gestört.
Still und weise weinte leise der Engel, ach, hast du’s gehört?

Bei dir sind die Himmel weit,
Wir liegen im Traum,
Sind eins mit der Zeit.

Die Seele fliegt,
Weil sie dich immer liebt.",Heimkehr
Max Prosa,"Mein Herz in der Dämmerung,
Vergangen im safranen Kleid.
Ich sitz' hier, bin leer,
Drei Tage sind weit.
Der Fluss trägt Trauer
In Rot durch die Täler aus Stein.
Du hast mich gefragt
Wer willst du sein?

Am Ende, wenn sich alles erhellt,
Wer war ich dann in dieser Welt?

Sie nahmen dich fort,
Fort hinunter zum Fluss.
Du riefst, nichts endet!
Dann fiel schon der Schuss.
Ich seh' noch dein Lächeln,
Ruhig sagtest du, alles wird gut!
Sorge dich nicht,
Es ist nur mein Blut.

Am Ende, wenn sich alles erhellt,
Wer war ich dann in dieser Welt?

Am Ufer wächst Gras,
Doch es riecht noch nach Blut.
Im Fluss schwimmen Blumen,
Oh, sie machen mir Mut.
Denn nun beginnt es, ja es beginnt!
Alles wird gut!",Rangoon
Max Prosa,"Wir sind verlorene Söhne, nie zurückgekehrt
Von der Suche nach Zuhause, und irgendwas von Wert

Wir sind gebrannte Kinder, einsam und verrückt

Wir sind Perlen vor die Säue, Piraten ohne Schiff
Laufen blind in Liebe, direkt aufs nächste Riff
Wir sind die edlen Ritter, auf der Suche nach dem Gral

Sind die letzte Hoffnung, im Tanz auf dem Vulkan
Wir sind naive Helden, aus ’nem bunten Comic–Heft
Alle unsre Träume, nur Strandgut im Geschäft

Noch dreißig Meilen bis zum großen Knall
Unsre Schritte klingen nach im U–Bahn–Hall
Und doch, wir kennen das Lied der Nachtigall!

Wir sind verpennte Wächter, des Elfenbeinturms
Unsre Seelen haben Flügel, wir lieben nur im Sturm
Wir saufen wie Propheten, was macht das schon
Wir treffen auch als Sänger, sowieso den falschen Ton

Sind ewig Partisanen, kämpfer ohne Sieg
Nach all den tausend Jahren, im immergleichen Krieg

Wir sind verlorene Söhne, es ist das alte Spiel",Verlorene Söhne
Max Prosa,"Sommerzeit
Und das Leben ist so leicht, wie’s in Kinderbüchern steht.
Sei bereit, dass was Neues kommt und geht.

Dein rotes Kleid,
Hängt seit Jahr und Tag im Schrank, es fragt dich jede Nacht wofür?
Es ist soweit! Der Fremde klopft an deiner Tür.

Verbotene Frucht im Mandelbaum im blütenweißen Kindheitstraum!
Oder ist das alte Paradies nur ein vergoldetes Verlies?

Dein Papagei
Rezitiert Kant und Rimbaud und er krächzt dein Lieblingslied.
In Wirklichkeit überlegt er wie er flieht.

Himmelweit
Sind die Tage, die du zählst, weil deine Nächte einsam sind.
Vergangenheit ist dein allerliebstes Kind.

Verbotene Frucht im Mandelbaum im blütenweißen Kindheitstraum.
Oder ist das alte Paradies nur ein vergoldetes Verlies?

Die Blaue Blume ist nicht weit, sie duftet wie dein rotes Kleid.
Der Zauberer ruft, er ruft nach Dir, nun geh und öffne ihm die Tür!

Max Prosa,"Der Boxer steigt wieder in den Ring
Hört wie ihr lärmt, wie ihr Lieder singt
Hat keine Wahl, außer diesem verdammten Kampf
Solang er boxt ist er frei und hat keine Angst
Und um ihn rum bebt die Stadt aus Stein
Und alle wollen seine Brüder sein
Sie wollen hören, dass er für immer ihr Junge ist
Und, dass er sie auch in Zukunft nie mehr vergisst

Doch er will hier nur gewinnen
Um diesem Schicksal zu entrinnen

Der Gegner ist dieser bunte Hund
Er kam vielleicht aus dem selben Grund
Er wird's ihm gönnen, denkt er, doch dann besinnt er sich
Er muss hier raus und so vergeht die Liebe nicht
Und er landet den ersten Schlag
Sein Gegner weicht, also trifft ihn hart
Doch er steckt's weg, er hat eine Unendlichkeit
Und Energie irgendwo und er lässt sich Zeit

Doch er will hier nur gewinnen
Um seinem Schicksal zu entrinnen
Die Kohle nehmen und verschwinden
Einfach verschwinden
Denn zwei strahlende Augen dieser Stadt aus Stein
Brachten das ausgesperrte Licht herein
Lassen ihn spüren es ist Zeit zu gehen
Leben ist schön und keiner kann uns das nehmen

Und er hat diesen Kampf im Griff
Spürt, dass er bald wieder Sieger ist
Der Gegner kämpft, doch der Schlag kommt schon nicht mehr hart
Der Boxer ist wütig und kommt dann voll in Fahrt
Dabei hört er die Menge schreien
Sie alle wollen seine Brüder sein
Und er begreift, dass er nur wirklich Abschied nimmt
Und alles klar macht, wenn er hier jetzt nicht gewinnt

Und er will hier nur verschwinden
Über seinen Schatten springen
Um seinem Schicksal zu entrinnen
Und irgendwo von vorn beginnen

Und der Ringrichter zählt ihn an
Sein Gegner, der es kaum fassen kann
Steht plötzlich da und die Menge gröhlt nur für ihn

Max Prosa,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Diesseits/Jenseits
Max Prosa,"Du kannst den Glauben an Freunde verlieren

Du kannst den Glauben ans Alleine sein verlieren 
Weil es immer Menschen geben wird, die dich berühren
Dann tobt dein Herz und bricht dein Schweigen
Wie von selbst wirst du dich zeigen
Diesen Glauben ans Alleine sein verlieren 

Du kannst den Glauben selbst an Zuhause verlieren
Wenn du zurückkehrst und dann hinter allen Türen
Etwas vor sich geht bei dem du einfach keine Rolle spielst 
Du kannst den Glauben an Zuhause verlieren

Ist ganz egal, ich will dich wie du bist
Und was immer du auch glaubst oder nicht

Doch klingeln die Kassen und keiner kämpft für mehr

Vom winzigsten Kucken will jeder sein stück
Wir schließen es ein, wir bewachen es schwer
Wir hoffen auch morgen aber keiner kämpft für mehr

Da kämen auch andere nicht weiter

Küssen, kann man nicht alleine
Und ich sag Dir auch den Grund
Küssen das geht auf keinen Fall alleine
Denn dazu brauch ich einen anderen Mund

Allein ist das unmöglich
Ich weiß genau das geht nicht

Das ist nur vertane Zeit
Ich müsste mal agieren
Und endlich kapieren
Da hilft kein meditieren
Küssen kann man nur zu zweit
Ich wär' dazu bereit

Ich habe mich sehr gut im Griff
Bin mein Kapitän und mein Schiff
Gerat' ich auch mal in die Miesen
Führ' ich mich aus allen Kriesen
Spionier' mich selber aus
Stell mich ein und schmeiß mich raus
Ich fahr mir hinten rein
Hau mir danach aufs Nasenbein

Ich les mir aus der Hand
Und klatsch mich an die Wand
Ich lach mich aus und lüg' mich an
Das ist es was ich sehr gut kann

Nur, Küssen, kann ich nicht alleine
Und ich sag Dir auch den Grund
Küssen geht auf keinen Fall alleine
Denn dazu brauch ich einen anderen Mund

Du bist gerade hier
Wie wärs wenn ich mir Dir
Die Sache mal probier'
Küssen kann man nur zu zweit

Die Lösung klappt zu zweit meist

Ist der Weg zum Kuss nicht weit

Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

Max Richter,"i sat the kitchen table and watched the sky grow lighter by the minute
it had been a long time since i'd seen the dawn
at one end of the sky, a line of blue appeared

if you gathered together all the shades of blue in the world
and picked the bluest
the epitome of blue
this is the color you would choose",Lullaby

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

But moonbeams being gold are something I can't behold

When you left the curtain fell

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

When it isn't even spring?

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought
To my plea casts a spell over me
Still I say to myself: get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it can never be?

You go to my head
With smile that makes my temperature rise

I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

I'll find other charms

I'll be loving

Max Romeo,"I was slowly passing an orphan's home one day
And stopped just for a moment just to watch the children play
A lonely boy was standing and when I asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see and he began to cry

I'm nobody's child, I'm nobody's child
Just like a flower I'm growing wild
No mommy's kisses and no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me, I'm nobody's child

People come for children and take them for their own
But they all seem to pass me and I am left here all alone
I know they'd like to take me but when they see I'm blind
They always take some other kids and I am left behind

I'm nobody's child, I'm nobody's child
Just like a flower I'm growing wild
No mommy's kisses and no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me, I'm nobody's child

No mommy's arms to hold me or soothe me when I cry
Sometimes it gets so lonely, I wish that I could die
I'd walk the streets of heaven where all the blind can see
And just like all the other kids, there'd be a home for me

I'm nobody's child, I'm nobody's child
Just like a flower I'm growing wild
No mommy's kisses and no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me, I'm nobody's child

Max Tundra,"I used to drive for a living, hairy arms fed the wheel thorough my palms
Twitching feet made patterns on pedals, reflexes honed in a twice-failed test
The pay man Lance kept me elastic bound in the echelons of West One
Slim chance of the odd long journey kept me clinging to him for too long
Locked in a car all day, came home and worked on Children At Play
I had no deal then, but I had fifty blank tapes in a bag waiting
I knew it wouldn't be long before I wrote Carbon Cones

Only last week, I noticed that the colours of the
Lights in my studio are the same as the ones you conjure in my mind
(Yellow and green, green pea green, cherry red and red and blue)
When my Amiga reads from a disk you know the
Green fills the room and your long summer dress fills my mind

My other jobs were none to speak of: ""Make a coffee for the man in Avid One
Drop these lunches off then take this Betacam to a place on Dean Street""
Most posts seemed to involve the lifting of heavy boxes
A man of such small frame as I broke into several sweats a day
Whilst failing to procure even the hint of any musculature improvement
Heavy-lifting days are in the bin now, but I still dip into tempting
Wearing the odd suit, attending the odd interview
Subsidising the drum programming you hear today

Only last week, I noticed that the colours of the
Lights in my studio are the same as the ones you conjure in my mind
(Yellow and green, green pea green, cherry red and red and blue)

Continuing down the page
The queen of Haverstock Hill
Onto a marble stage
Arrives and tells us about the

Cassettes and catgut
A squealing sackbut
I toast a pine nut
And serve it in my hut

Downstairs they're playing trance again
That awful bendy guitar
Up through the floor again
It's 9 AM 'til I cry
And Time And A Word, my friend
Inspires me more than guitars

here's Lucy she's choosey / of who calls her on the phone
She's from a very rich foreign family / but displaced cause of rivalry at home

now Daphne is the orphan / still searching for her roots
She likes concert blisters and leather boots
And knows one fact her act is to get loose

now we're just musicians / here to thin the thickness of your skin

show us your body / show us your curls / show us your tour de force
Show us your thrills / keep that smile on your face
This is the best offer you've had so far

we're innocent we're naive / in the cabarets we get our veins wet
In the saloons we hassle the richest guests
In the climb we're breathless above the rest

Maxeen,"She flew in on a jumbo jet
From ohio to LAX
Things went from bad to worse
When she told me
She's enjoyed not having sex

darling it's ok
If you don't want to play
But why the hell did you come
All this way

just to push me away
Gettaway

I was doin' it all for you
With no money in the bank
And no job too
I was just about
To lose my lunch
You put down a cool hundred
For a pair of shoes

girl I have to say
So put that book away
And tell me
Why the hell did you come all this way

just to push me away

You're bright the darkness my love

Our dynamic symmetry combines

I found what was missing inside you
Break my fall
Na na na na na na na
Break my fall
I found what is missing inside you
Break my fall

Always with you
Connected by blood my love
A purpose fulfilled
You're my light in this dark, dark world

This unspoken within
I feel complete my love
The moments apart
I'm craving your light in the dark

In the crowded empty spaces

At the emptiness around you

Right before my very eyes hey
 
[Chorus]
Life everyday its getting harder
Oh life rougher everyday
Oh life everyday its getting harder
Oh life tougher everyday
 
Strike another match to light the fire
There's another mouth to feed
I send little Jimmy to fetch the water
Lord knows just how I feel
 
[Chorus]
 
'Cause I'm feeling the pain yeah
'Cause I'm feeling the pain
He who feels it knows it
As we're feeling the chill of a whistling breeze
Man made rules the system keeps us down
As we're fighting the fight for the young ones
 
[Chorus x2]
 
Rougher every day
Oh life oh life

Maxi Priest,"Just one more chance with you, darling
Just one more chance

She wrote me her letters, she no longer cared
But the tears upon the paper said she lied, she lied
If only I'd listened, if only I'd tried
Then this house would still have been a home
Oh, tell me why it took us all so long to realize
Oh why? It's oh so obvious

Never did say goodbye
She never stopped to say goodbye, no
Never did say goodbye
She never stopped to say goodbye, no

If I could be with you and hold back my pride
And this love we'll make it bind
We'll look to the future, remembering the past
We'll never lose our way again
Oh, tell me why it took us all so long to realize
Oh why? It's oh so obvious

Never did say goodbye
She never stopped to say goodbye, no
Never did say goodbye
She never stopped to say goodbye, no

How can I survive without a reason to go on?
My baby's not here to love me
How can I forget without a reason to go on?
My baby's not here to love me

Ooh why? Never did say goodbye
Never turned and said a reason why
Just one more chance with you, darling

Then I realize the score

So afraid to think about tomorrow

For so many years
Been through stormy weather
Shared our joys and tears

Has got me so confused
Feeling so rejected
Feeling like I'm used

What more can I say
What more can I do
Seems I'm wasting my time
Trying to show you

You've got the best of me
More than I can give
In every part of me
Just for you I live

You've got the best of me

Only just to please you
And you're still believing
That I don't give a damn

Yes I've made my mistakes
With no intent to hurt you
Tried so very hard
Just to make you understand

What more can I say

Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
 
Alone in a crowd on a bus after working, I'm dreaming
The guy next to me has a girl in his arms, my arms are empty
How does it feel when the girl next to you says she loves you?
Seems so unfair when there's love everywhere but there's none for me
 
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain

Someone to take on a walk by the lake Lord, let it be me
Someone who's shy, someone who'd cry at sad movies
I know I would die if I ever found out she was foolin' me
You're just a dream, and as real as it seems, I ain't that lucky
 
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
 
All of my friends have a ring on their finger, they have someone
Someone to care for them, it ain't fair, I got no one
The car overheated, I called up and pleaded, there's help on the way
I called you collect, you didn't accept, you had nothing to say
 
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain

I'd feel so happy, I could cry

And it's breaking my heart in two
Because I never want to see you sad girl

Hope you find a lot of nice friends out there

Always had to ???
Starvation in the third world

Maxi Priest,"Cry, human cry   
Cry cry ooh Lord
There's a dark place in the heart of the city  
Where no one goes  
People up-town won't admit it

People out there they got bad intentions   
And there's nothing to lose

Human cry cry cry  
Human cry from the battlefield  
Human oooh Lord

Shattered dreams of forgotten souls

Afraid to take the risk  
Looking for a way out that's not there  
Desperate faces everywhere so hungry   
Searching for shelter

Fragile the place is fragile  
We're on the edge of all tomorrows  
And you just can feel the tension  
Tearing us apart  
We're gonna let go if we lose a heart  
Ooh oh the place is fragile 
 
Say it's midnight on the street  
Graffiti everywhere  
And in a fortress on higher ground  
People live in fear  
No this ain't no distant dream  
It's in our own backyard   
Look all around you

It's what I need to achieve
And even in times of doubt my faith I can't leave with out
In God the King I believe

One day I know my Lord
Love will take over oh yeah
One day I know
We will cross over oh well

Carrying my heavy load
I know that I'm not alone
And when the day is done
I know the time has come
To give my thanks once more

Soon one day I know
We will cross over
 
Now there is a time and a place
We've got to run the race
Now there is a lesson to learn, teach them
So we never give up the fight
When we believe we're right
We can overcome

And even if it rains i can be your umbrella
So tell me what to do (so I can) hold you much closer

Baby won't you give me just your name and your number
Or is there someone else I don't see no ring
And if you say no we can do our thing
It's looking like your free, is it true that you're single
so maybe we can get together and mingle

I wanted to hold you

Why can't you be mine

I can't be without you

To love you forever
If only I could be the one

I just can't ignore you
Could I be the one, just let me be the one
Someone you can run to

Today there's gonna be no sun
Stormy weather's coming down
Everybody's changing plans
A little drop of rain they start to run away
I don't really give a damn
'Cause in the rain we're gonna stay
 
Warm drops on the skin, let the love begin
I'll give you love the way you want it
In any kind of weather
 
[Chorus]
So what if it rains, I'll be inside
Safe in the shelter of your love far from the storm
So what if it rains slippery when warm
Deep within your love the sun still shines
So what if it rains so what so what
 
Laying on a bed of flowers
Songbirds all around us sing the joy of spring
And the crazy things it brings
Lovers in the moment do it anywhere
I love it when we're wrapped up
Rockin' to the rhythm of the pouring rain
Like a summer storm you come for me
Every time I let you feel my thunder
 
Warm drops on the skin, let the love begin
I'll give you love the way you want it
In any kind of weather
 
[Chorus]
 
It feels so good inside your love
I couldn't stop if I wanted to ooh baby
The sun is breaking out above
I can hear the people coming out
I don't give a damn who's watching
Or if we draw a crowd
I'm gonna tell the world I love you
And I'm gonna say it out loud

Ooh baby I don't give a damn if it rains
Don't give a damn baby Don't give a damn baby ooh

Don't get caught in no desperation
Use your skill from your ghetto irration
Feel the vibration
Some people see it astrologically
But I didn't get that from my triga knowledgy
 
What a friend who would deceive
Use your faith when you believe
Thought he was a friend
The human love we thought was real
So off and on so what's the deal
Thought he was a friend yeah

Trying to find a way in this world of attrition
Jah Jah on a mission
Work it out,work it out
 
Keep it real
 
We gotta find a sanctuary
Flip into the 21st century
Keep it real and lose the fakes
Learn all your lessons from your own mistakes
Children now will come of age

Ich hab unsere Wohnung gekündigt 
Für diesen einen Augenblick 
Alles aufs Spiel gesetzt 
Und jetzt steh ich da mit Nichts

Ich würd's wieder riskieren 
Denn ich will lieber bluten, lieber bluten als frieren

Um mir was Neues aufzubauen

Denn ich will lieber bluten, lieber bluten als frieren 
Ich will lieber bluten, lieber bluten als frieren

Es wirft mich in ein schwarzes Loch 
Hüllt mich in Dunkelheit 
Taucht mich in Schmerz und badet mich in Schweiß 
Es zerquetscht mir die Brust, schnürt mir die Kehle zu, 
Raubt mir den Schlaf und erstickt meine Wut

Maxim,"Es sind nicht viele, die sich zusammengefunden haben, 
Hier, wo wir unsere Generation begraben, 
In einer schlichten Kiste, aus einem schwarzen Wagen, 
Auf den Schultern unserer Kinder vor uns hergetragen. 
Unsere Mäntel wehen stumm im Regen, 
Niemand faltet die Hände, um für uns zu beten, 
Keine letzten Worte, keine Trauerreden, 
Keine Nasen triefen, keine Augen tränen.

Keine Lieder, keine Fahnen, 
Kein Weihrauch und kein Amen, 
Wir kriegen nicht mal einen Namen 
Und alles, was auf unserem Grabstein steht, 
Ist 1980 bis 2010.

Ein Sonnenstrahl fällt auf den Stein daneben, 
Wo unsere Eltern stehen und ihre Blumen niederlegen. 
Dort liegt ein Traum begraben und er wird weiterleben, 
Während hier Unkraut wächst und Spinnen ihre Netze weben. 
Ich schau zu den Krähen, die in den Ästen sitzen 
Während sie Erde über unsere Überreste kippen. 
Keine Taschentücher, keinen letzten Segen 
Und es ist jetzt schon so, als wären wir immer weggewesen.

Und unsere Grablichter treiben 
Durch die Rinnsteine hinein 
In die offene See 
Und alles, was auf unserem Grabstein steht, 
Ist 1980 bis 2010.",1980-2010
Maxim,"Ich kann nicht aufstehen, ich komm nicht raus,
Die Arme eingeschlafen, alles taub.
Spinnweben fesseln mich an die Couch,
Die Fliegen fallen lautlos in den Staub.

Alles geht vorüber, irgendwann,
Einen Winter noch, bis ich wieder blühen kann.

Der Wasserhahn tropft und der Gummibaum verwelkt,
Motten fressen sich durch den Vorhang ins grelle Licht der Welt,
Das dann als Suchscheinwerfer vor meine Füße fällt.
Doch ich halt still und die Photos verblassen
Und die Tapeten werden gelb.

Alles zieht vorüber, irgendwann,
Einen Winter noch, bis ich mich wieder zeigen kann.

Die Sonne unter und die Sonne geht auf
Und vor den Ästen vor meinem Fenster weht Laub
Und Schnee fällt und Schnee taut
Und all meine Fußstapfen auch.

Oder wenigstens nicht ganz so krumm.

Ist nicht nötig das du fragst,

Maxim,"Ch baue mir ein Haus aus Schrott in einem Feld aus weißer Asche, 
Mein Paradies aus Schutt,
Pflanze Blumen in meinem Garten, Brennnesseln und Disteln,
Und niemand macht mir das kaputt.
Und wenn die Sonne untergeht am versmogten Horizont,
Steig ich auf mein Wellblechdach
Und lasse die Blicke schweifen übers vergiftete Meer
Und die vor sich hin rostenden Wracks.
Ich puste Seifenblasen in die verschmutze Luft
Und schau den Träumen beim platzen zu.
Und wie es war, bevor du gingst, hab ich längst vergessen.
Alles ist wunderschön und gut!

Ich hab meine kleine Welt mit hübschem, bunten Plastikmüll geschmückt,
Ich trage meine Lieblingslumpen und weine Tränen des Glücks.

Aber deine Augen sehen, was sie wollen, du tickst, so wie du tickst.
Und auch mein Herz fühlt, was es eben fühlt ind nicht das, was es soll,
Und das Haus aus Schrott ist eigentlich eine Ruine aus Gold.

Und ich sitze zwischen übertreuten Gemälden und totdesigneten Möbeln,
Bin gelangweilt und verwöhnt,
Es wächst Unkraut in meinem Garten, Orchideen und Rosen,
Und niemand redet mir das schön.
Sie bringen riesig große Teller mit winzigen Portionen,
Aber alle schmeckt nach nichts
Und ich spiegel' mich im Silber und ich seh' furchtbar aus,
Keine Falte im Gesicht.
Und ich krieg kein Auge zu in meinem Himmelbett des Grauens und ihr Parfum,
Wie es mir stinkt.
Ach dreh die Zeit noch mal zurück, denn ich werd' nie vergessen,
Wie es war, bevor du gingst.

Und ich starre auf meinen Pool und schau den Träumen
Beim In-Erfüllung-Gehen zu
Und ich lache aus Verzweiflung, denn eine Taube scheißt mir auf den Schuh.

Ganz egal wo ich bin, ich will weg.
Bin es selbst schon Leid, mein verdammtes Selbstmitleid!

Systematisch jeden Gedanken an dich unterdrücken

Denn es reicht ein Zeichen der Schwäche, ein Zittern der Finger
Ich brauch kühles Blut, denn es tut mir nicht gut, mich an dich zu erinnern
Es tut mir nicht gut, mich an dich zu erinnern

Und immer wenn mein Herz nach dir ruft
Und das Chaos ausbricht in mir drin
Schick ich meine Soldaten los
Um den Widerstand niederzuzwingen
Immer wenn mein Herz nach dir ruft
Und es brennt in den Straßen in mir drin
Befehle ich meiner Armee alles zu tun
Um es wieder zum Schweigen zu bringen
Das ist geknebelt, gebrochen, es wird weggesperrt
Und mir endlich gehorcht mein armes Herz

Ein guter Soldat stellt keine Fragen
Er läuft Runden im Park, bis die Beine versagen
Die Sternen im Staub wie ein ja und dein Namen
Ein Soldat vergisst alles
Im Falle des Falles auch den eigenen Namen
Doch ich brauch nur einen Verräter, eine undichte Stelle
Einen winzigen Stein für eine gewaltige Welle
Ein Funken im Zunder, und alles steht wieder in Flammen

Klappt wie ein Kartenhaus an sich zusammen

Hier unten am Fluss,
Und wenn das Wasser
Die Scherben stumpf geschliffen hat und nichts mehr schneidet
In deiner Brust.

Wenn du an all die Sommer denkst,
Träumst die Falten aus der Stirn,
Aber dir wird sofort schlecht,
Und du versuchst, dir vorzustellen,
Was wohl eines Tages aus dir wird.

Und das Glück steht vor dir an der Straße
Und hält den Daumen raus
Aber alles geht so schnell, dass es dir immer erst auffällt,
Wenn du in den Rückspiegel schaust.
Und dann ist es längst zu spät, um anzuhalten,
Dann musst du weiter geradeaus,
Bis das Glück wieder an dir vorbeirauscht,
Weil du ständig in den Rückspiegel schaust.

Und wie oft musst du
Alles auf den Kopf stellen,
Bis du endlich siehst,
Und dass der Schlüssel
Den du so verzweifelt suchst, die ganze Zeit
Direkt vor deiner Nase liegt.
Du krabbelst mit 'ner Augenbinde
Und 'nem Löffel durch die Welt
Und du bist immer lauwarm dran
Und morgen früh
Fängt diese ganze traurige Komödie
Wieder von vorne an.

Ich habe sie überall gesucht und mir die Augen stumpf gelesen

Irgendwo im Alltagstrott, da drüben an der Ecke,
Wo der alte Mann gerade die Mülltonnen abklappert,
Mit wahnsinnigen Augen seine Mantras runterrattert.

Try to control me, try to control me

Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head
Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head

Systems I pollute, come bite my forbidden fruit
Stain your environment, chalk up my bad influence
Saturate reality, go to battle with your sanity
The human race I exploit, and I leave you no choice

Flood and overflow your cranium, what's the millennium?
Personality not present, overturn your only innocence
Suffocate your desire, set your vivid force on fire
Into my world which you brought, prepare for second onslaught

Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head
Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head
Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head

I'll stunt your growth, degrade your self-esteem, leave you no hope
Bleach your eyes with turpentine, tamper with the cord in the spine
Subside your love life, separate the yolk from the white
I'm the true creator, mind decapitator

I'm the evil that lurks, the pain inside that hurts
Spike your dreams, plant my thoughts obscene, unclean
Impregnate your ears, when you hear me, it's me you fear
Me they hate the most, oh fuck, here comes the third dose

Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head
Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head
Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head
Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head

Dissect you, detect my style like Ceausescu
Sell your soul, libido, jeopardize, pulverize your ego
Dice and slice your skills, your pride inside, I kill
Show no remorse, you shouldn't play with the true force

Terminate and scandalize, damage, expose, rectify
You best fake your death, after me there'll be nothing left
Abuse and torture, lyrically bring the lamb to the slaughter
Increase my pace, style for direct in your face

Maxime le Forestier,"Je vivais à l'écart de la place publique,
Serein, contemplatif, ténébreux, bucolique
Refusant d'acquitter la rançon de la gloire,
Sur mon brin de laurier je dormais comme un loir.
Les gens de bon conseil ont su me faire comprendre
Qu'à l'homme de la rue j'avais des comptes à rendre
Et que, sous peine de choir dans un oubli complet,
Je devais mettre au grand jour tous mes petits secrets.

Trompettes
De la Renommée,
Vous êtes
Bien mal embouchées!

Manquant à la pudeur la plus élémentaire,
Dois-je, pour les besoins d' la cause publicitaire,
Divulguer avec qui, et dans quelle position
Je plonge dans le stupre et la fornication?
Si je publie des noms, combien de Pénélopes
Passeront illico pour de fieffées salopes,
Combien de bons amis me regarderont de travers,
Combien je recevrai de coups de revolver!

A toute exhibition, ma nature est rétive,
Souffrant d'un' modestie quasiment maladive,
Je ne fais voir mes organes procréateurs
A personne, excepté mes femmes et mes docteurs.
Dois-je, pour défrayer la chronique des scandales,
Battre l' tambour avec mes parties génitales,
Dois-je les arborer plus ostensiblement,
Comme un enfant de chœur porte un saint sacrement?

Une femme du monde, et qui souvent me laisse
Faire mes quat' voluptés dans ses quartiers d' noblesse,
M'a sournoisement passé, sur son divan de soie,
Des parasites du plus bas étage qui soit
Sous prétexte de bruit, sous couleur de réclame,
Ai-j' le droit de ternir l'honneur de cette dame
En criant sur les toits, et sur l'air des lampions
""Madame la marquis' m'a foutu des morpions!""?

Le ciel en soit loué, je vis en bonne entente
Avec le Père Duval, la calotte chantante,
Lui, le catéchumène, et moi, l'énergumène,
Il me laisse dire merde, je lui laisse dire amen,
En accord avec lui, dois-je écrire dans la presse
Qu'un soir je l'ai surpris aux genoux d' ma maîtresse,
Chantant la mélopée d'une voix qui susurre,
Tandis qu'elle lui cherchait des poux dans la tonsure?

Avec qui, ventrebleu! faut-il que je couche
Pour faire parler un peu la déesse aux cent bouches?
Faut-il qu'un' femme célèbre, une étoile, une star,
Vienne prendre entre mes bras la place de ma guitare?
Pour exciter le peuple et les folliculaires,
Qui est-ce qui veut me prêter sa croupe populaire,
Qui est-ce qui veut m' laisser faire, in naturalibus,
Un petit peu d'alpinisme sur son mont de Vénus?

Sonneraient-elles plus fort, ces divines trompettes,
Si, comme tout un chacun, j'étais un peu tapette,
Si je me déhanchais comme une demoiselle
Et prenais tout à coup des allumes de gazelle?
Mais je ne sache pas que ça profite à ces drôles
De jouer le jeu d' l'amour en inversant les rôles,
Que ça confère à ma gloire un' once de plus-valu',
Le crime pédérastique, aujourd'hui, ne paie plus.

Après ce tour d'horizon des mille et un' recettes
Qui vous valent à coup sûr les honneurs des gazettes,
J'aime mieux m'en tenir à ma première façon
Et me gratter le ventre en chantant des chansons.
Si le public en veut, je les sors dare-dare,
S'il n'en veut pas je les remets dans ma guitare.
Refusant d'acquitter la rançon de la gloire,
Sur mon brin de laurier je m'endors comme un loir.",Les Trompettes de La Renommée

en méprisant l'insulte et le remonte-pente,
et sans aucun bravo qui le réconfortât !

et les clous enfoncés dans les pieds et les mains,
c'est très inconfortable et ça vous tarabuste,
même si l'on est brave et si l'on est robuste,
et si le paradis est au bout du chemin.
bien sûr, mais il devait défendre son prestige,
car il était le fils du ciel, l'enfant prodige,
il était le messie et ne l'ignorait pas.
entre son père et lui, c'était l'accord tacite :
tu montes sur la croix et je te ressuscite !
on meurt de confiance avec un tel papa.
il a donné sa vie sans doute mais son zèle
avait une portée quasi universelle
qui rendait le supplice un peu moins douloureux.
il savait que, dans chaque église, il serait tête
d'affiche et qu'il aurait son portrait en vedette,
entouré des élus, des saints, des bienheureux.
en se sacrifiant, il sauvait tous les hommes.
du moins le croyait-il ! au point où nous en sommes,
on peut considérer qu'il s'est fichu dedans.
le jeu, si j'ose dire, en valait la chandelle.

pour un but aussi noble, en feraient tout autant.

Pour débaptiser
Nos petites rues.

Moi, la première à qui
Mon cœur fut tout acquis
S'app'lait Jeanne Martin,
Patronyme qui fait
Pas tellement d'effet
Dans le bottin mondain.

Mais moi j'aimais comme un
Fou ce nom si commun,
N'en déplaise aux minus.
D'ailleurs, de parti pris,
Celle que je chéris,
S'appell' toujours Vénus.

Hélas un béotien
A la place du sien
Lui proposa son blase
Fameux dans l'épicerie
Et cette renchérie
Refusa pas, hélas !

Et j'eus ma troisième tristesse d'Olympio,
Déférence gardée envers le père Hugo.

Si faire se peut
Attendez un peu
Cinq minutes, non?
Gentes fiancées,
Que l'on soit passé
Pour changer de nom.",Jeanne Martin

Qui venait de perdre sa mère
L'adopta

Et le couche contre son sein

Se mit à téter tout de go

Trouvant le tableau peu commun

N'aurait lues

Du Saint Sacrifice abandonnent

Maxime le Forestier,"C'est à travers de larges grilles
Que les femelles du canton
Contemplaient un puissant gorille
Sans souci du qu'en-dira-t-on

Avec impudeur, ces commères
Lorgnaient même un endroit précis
Que, rigoureusement ma mère
M'a défendu dénommer ici gare au gorille

Tout à coup, la prise bien close
Où vivait le bel animal
S'ouvre on ne sait pourquoi
(Je suppose qu'on avait du la fermer mal)

Le singe, en sortant de sa cage
Dit ""c'est aujourd'hui que je le perds""
Il parlait de son pucelage
Vous avez deviné, j'espère gare au gorille

Le patron de la ménagerie
Criait, éperdu, ""Nom de nom
C'est assommant car le gorille
N'a jamais connu de guenon""

Dès que la féminine engeance
Sut que le singe était puceau
Au lieu de profiter de la chance
Elle fit feu des deux fuseaux gare au gorille

Celles là même qui, naguère
Le couvaient d'un œil décidé
Fuirent, prouvant qu'elles n'avaient guère
De la suite dans les idées

D'autant plus vaine était leur crainte
Que le gorille est un luron
Supérieur à l'homme dans l'étreinte
Bien des femmes vous le diront gare au gorille

Tout le monde se précipite
Hors d'atteinte du singe en rut
Sauf une vielle décrépite
Et un jeune juge en bois brut

Voyant que toutes se dérobent
Le quadrumane accéléra
Son dandinement vers les robes
De la vielle et du magistrat gare au gorille

""Bah, soupirait la centiare
Qu'on puisse encore me désirer
Ce serait extraordinaire
Et, pour tout dire, inespéré""

Le juge pensait, impassible
""Qu'on me prenne pour une guenon
C'est complètement impossible""
La suite lui prouva que non gare au gorille

Supposez que l'un de vous puisse être
Comme le singe, obligé de
Violer un juge ou une ancêtre
Lequel choisirait-il des deux?

Qu'une alternative pareille
Un de ces quatres jours, m'échoie
C'est, j'en suis convaincu, la vielle
Qui sera l'objet de mon choix gare au gorille

Mais, par malheur, si le gorille
Aux jeux de l'amour vaut son prix
On sait qu'en revanche il ne brille
Ni par le goût, ni par l'esprit

Lors, au lieu d'opter pour la vielle
Comme aurait fait n'importe qui
Il saisit le juge à l'oreille
Et l'entraîna dans un maquis gare au gorille

La suite serait délectable
Malheureusement, je ne peux
Pas la dire, et c'est regrettable
Ça nous aurait fait rire un peu

Car le juge, au moment suprême
Criait, ""Maman"" pleurait beaucoup
Comme l'homme auquel, le jour même
Il avait fait trancher le cou gare au gorille

Maxime le Forestier,"Venez, vous dont l'œil étincelle
Pour entendre une histoire encore
Approchez: je vous dirai celle
De doña Padilla del Flor
Elle était d'Alanje, où s'entassent
Les collines et les halliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Il est des filles à Grenade
Il en est à Séville aussi
Qui, pour la moindre sérénade
A l'amour demandent merci
Il en est que parfois embrassent
Le soir, de hardis cavaliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Ce n'est pas sur ce ton frivole
Qu'il faut parler de Padilla
Car jamais prunelle espagnole
D'un feu plus chaste ne brilla
Elle fuyait ceux qui pourchassent
Les filles sous les peupliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Elle prit le voile à Tolède
Au grand soupir des gens du lieu
Comme si, quand on n'est pas laide
On avait droit d'épouser Dieu
Peu s'en fallut que ne pleurassent
Les soudards et les écoliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Or, la belle à peine cloîtrée
Amour en son cœur s'installa
Un fier brigand de la contrée
Vint alors et dit : ""Me voilà!""
Quelquefois les brigands surpassent
En audace les chevaliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Il était laid : les traits austères
La main plus rude que le gant
Mais l'amour a bien des mystères
Et la nonne aima le brigand
On voit des biches qui remplacent
Leurs beaux cerfs par des sangliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

La nonne osa, dit la chronique
Au brigand par l'enfer conduit
Aux pieds de Sainte Véronique
Donner un rendez-vous la nuit
A l'heure où les corbeaux croassent
Volant dans l'ombre par milliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Or quand, dans la nef descendue
La nonne appela le bandit
Au lieu de la voix attendue
C'est la foudre qui répondit
Dieu voulu que ses coups frappassent
Les amants par Satan liés
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Cette histoire de la novice
Saint Ildefonse, abbé, voulut
Qu'afin de préserver du vice
Les vierges qui font leur salut
Les prieurs la racontassent

Auprès d'une sirène, une femme-poisson
J'ai reçu de l'amour la première leçon
Avalait la première arête

Déférence gardée envers Paul Valéry
Moi l'humble troubadour sur lui je renchéris
Le bon maître me le pardonne
Et qu'au moins si ses vers valent mieux que les miens
Mon cimetière soit plus marin que le sien
N'en déplaise aux autochtones

Cette tombe en sandwich entre le ciel et l'eau
Ne donnera pas une ombre triste au tableau
Mais un charme indéfinissable
Les baigneuses s'en serviront de paravent
Pour changer de tenue et les petits enfants
Diront, chouette, un château de sable!

Est-ce trop demander, sur mon petit lopin
Planter, je vous en prie une espèce de pin
Pin parasol de préférence
Qui saura prémunir contre l´insolation
Les bons amis venus faire sur ma concession
D'affectueuses révérences

Tantôt venant d'Espagne, tantôt d'Italie
Tous chargés de parfums, de musiques jolies
Le Mistral, la Tramontane
Sur mon dernier sommeil verseront les échos
De villanelle, un jour, un jour de fandango
De tarentelle, de sardane

Et quand prenant ma butte en guise d'oreiller
Une ondine viendra gentiment sommeiller
Avec moins que rien de costume
J'en demande pardon par avance à Jésus
Si l'ombre de sa croix s'y couche un peu dessus
Pour un petit bonheur posthume

Pauvres rois pharaons, pauvre Napoléon
Pauvres grands disparus gisant au Panthéon
Pauvres cendres de conséquence
Vous envierez un peu l'éternel estivant
Qui fait du pédalo sur la vague en rêvant
Qui passe sa mort en vacances

Maxime le Forestier,"Notre voisin l'ancêtre était un fier galant
Qui n'emmerdait personne avec sa barbe blanche
Et quand le bruit courut qu'ses jours étaient comptés
On s'en fut à l'hospice afin de l'assister

On avait apporté les guitars avec nous
Car, devant la musique, il tombait à genoux
Excepté toutefois les marches militaires
Qu'il écoutait en se tapant le cul par terre

Du côté de Bicêtre
Pas de musique d'orgue, oh non!
Pas de chants liturgiques
Pour qui aval' sa chique
Mais des guitars, crénom de nom!

On avait apporté quelques litres aussi
Car le bonhomme avait la fièvre de Bercy
Et les soirs de nouba, paroles de tavernier
A rouler sous la table il était le dernier
A rouler sous la table il était le dernier

Saumur, Entre-deux-mers, Beaujolais, Marsala
Toute la fine fleur de la vigne était là
Pour offrir à l'ancêtre, en signe d'affection
En guis’ de viatique, une ultime libation
En guis’ de viatique, une ultime libation

Hélas! les carabins ne les ont pas reçus
Les litres sont restés à la porte cochère
Et l'coup de l'étrier de l'ancêtre déçu
Ce fut un grand verre d'eau bénite, peuchère!

Quand nous serons ancêtres
Du côté de Bicêtre
Ne nous faites pas boire, oh non!
De ces eaux minérales
Bénites ou lustrales
Mais du bon vin, crénom de nom!
Mais du bon vin, crénom de nom!

On avait emmené les belles du quartier
Car l'ancêtre courait la gueuse volontiers
De sa main toujours leste et digne cependant
Il troussait les jupons par n'importe quel temps
Il troussait les jupons par n'importe quel temps

Depuis Manon Lescaut jusques à Dalila
Toute la fine fleur du beau sexe était là

En guis' de viatique, une ultime érection

Hélas! les carabins ne les ont pas reçus

Maxime le Forestier,"Ayant avecques lui toujours fait bon ménage
J'eusse aimé célébrer sans être inconvenant
Tendre corps féminin ton plus bel apanage
Que tous ceux qui l'ont vu disent hallucinant.

Ceût été mon ultime chant mon chant du cygne
Mon dernier billet doux mon message d'adieu
Or malheureusement les mots qui le désignent
Le disputent à l'exécrable à l'odieux.

C'est la grande pitié de la langue française
C'est son talon d'Achille et c'est son déshonneur
De n'offrir que des mots entachés de bassesse
A cette incomparable instrument de bonheur.

Alors que tant de fleurs ont des noms poétiques
Tendre corps féminin' c'est fort malencontreux
Que la fleur la plus douce la plus érotique
Et la plus enivrante en ait de plus scabreux.

Mais le pire de tous est un petit vocable
De trois lettres pas plus familier coutumier
Il est inexplicable il est irrévocable
Honte à celui-là qui l'employa le premier

Honte à celui-là qui par dépit par gageure
Dota de même terme en son fiel venimeux
Ce grand ami de l'homme et la cinglante injure
Celui-là c'est probable en était un fameux.

Misogyne à coup sûr asexué sans doute
Au charmes de Vénus absolument rétif
Etait ce bougre qui toute honte bue toute
Fit ce rapprochement d'ailleurs intempestif.

La malpeste soit de cette homonymie
C'est injuste madame et c'est désobligeant
Que ce morceau de roi de votre anatomie
Porte le même nom qu'une foule de gens.

Fasse le ciel qu'un jour, dans un trait de génie
Un poète inspiré que Pégase soutient
Donne en effaçant d'un coup des siècles d'avanie
A cette vraie merveille un joli nom chrétien

Et vos adorateurs en seraient tous peinés
D'aller perdre de vue que pour lui rendre hommage

Et que je les connais.",Le Blason

Maxime le Forestier,"Du temps que régnait le Grand Pan,
Les dieux protégaient les ivrognes
Des tas de génies titubants
Au nez rouge, à la rouge trogne.
Dès qu'un homme vidait les cruchons,
Qu'un sac à vin faisait carousse
Ils venaient en bande à ses trousses
Compter les bouchons.
La plus humble piquette était alors bénie,
Distillée par Noé, Silène, et compagnie.
Le vin donnait un lustre au pire des minus,
Et le moindre pochard avait tout de Bacchus.

{Refrain:}
Mais en se touchant le crâne, en criant "" J'ai trouvé ""
La bande au professeur Nimbus est arrivée
Qui s'est mise à frapper les cieux d'alignement,
Chasser les Dieux du Firmament.

Aujourd'hui ça et là, les gens boivent encore,
Et le feu du nectar fait toujours luire les trognes.
Mais les dieux ne répondent plus pour les ivrognes.
Bacchus est alcoolique, et le grand Pan est mort.

Quand deux imbéciles heureux
S'amusaient à des bagatelles,
Un tas de génies amoureux

Venaient leur tenir la chandelle.
Du fin fond du champs élysées
Dès qu'ils entendaient un "" Je t'aime "",
Ils accouraient à l'instant même
Compter les baisers.
La plus humble amourette
Etait alors bénie
Sacrée par Aphrodite, Eros, et compagnie.
L'amour donnait un lustre au pire des minus,
Et la moindre amoureuse avait tout de Vénus.

{Refrain}

Aujourd'hui ça et là, les c?urs battent encore,
Et la règle du jeu de l'amour est la même.
Mais les dieux ne répondent plus de ceux qui s'aiment.
Vénus s'est faite femme, et le grand Pan est mort.

Et quand fatale sonnait l'heure
De prendre un linceul pour costume
Un tas de génies l'?il en pleurs
Vous offraient des honneurs posthumes.
Et pour aller au céleste empire,
Dans leur barque ils venaient vous prendre.
C'était presque un plaisir de rendre
Le dernier soupir.
La plus humble dépouille était alors bénie,
Embarquée par Caron, Pluton et compagnie.
Au pire des minus, l'âme était accordée,
Et le moindre mortel avait l'éternité.

{Refrain}

Aujourd'hui ça et là, les gens passent encore,
Mais la tombe est hélas la dernière demeure
Les dieux ne répondent plus de ceux qui meurent.
La mort est naturelle, et le grand Pan est mort.

Et l'un des dernier dieux, l'un des derniers suprêmes,
Ne doit plus se sentir tellement bien lui-même
Un beau jour on va voir le Christ
Descendre du calvaire en disant dans sa lippe
"" Merde je ne joue plus pour tous ces pauvres types.
J'ai bien peur que la fin du monde soit bien triste. """,Le Grand Pan
Maxime le Forestier,"Mariage d'amour, mariage d'argent
J'ai vu se marier toutes sortes de gens
Des gens de basse source et des grands de la terre
Des prétendus coiffeurs, des soi-disant notaires

Quand même je vivrai jusqu'à la fin des temps
Je garderais toujours le souvenir content
Du jour de pauvre noce où mon père et ma mère
S'allèrent épouser devant Monsieur le Maire

C'est dans un char à bœufs, s'il faut parler bien franc
Tiré par les amis, poussé par les parents
Que les vieux amoureux firent leurs épousailles
Après long temps d'amour, long temps de fiançailles
Cortège nuptial hors de l'ordre courant
La foule nous couvait d'un œil protubérant
Nous étions contemplés par le monde futile
Qui n'avait jamais vu de noces de ce style

Voici le vent qui souffle emportant, crève-cœur
Le chapeau de mon père et les enfants de chœur
Voilà la pluie qui tombe en pesant bien ses gouttes
Comme pour empêcher la noc', coûte que coûte

Je n'oublierai jamais la mariée en pleurs
Berçant comme un' poupée son gros bouquet de fleurs
Moi, pour la consoler, moi, de toute ma morgue
Sur mon harmonica jouant les grandes orgues

J'en ai fait une, putain de moine,
Plaise à Dieu qu'elle plaise aux copains. {2x}

Ancienne enfant d'Marie-salope
Mélanie, la bonne au curé,
Dedans ses trompes de Fallope,
S'introduit des cierges sacrés.
Des cierges de cire d'abeille
Plus onéreux, mais bien meilleurs, {2x}
Dame! la qualité se paye
A Saint-Sulpice, comme ailleurs. {2x}

Quand son bon maître lui dit : ""Est-ce
Trop vous demander Mélanie,
De n'user, par délicatesse,
Que de cierges non encore bénits ?""
Du tac au tac, elle réplique
Moi, je préfère qu'ils le soient, {2x}
Car je suis bonne catholique
Elle a raison, ça va de soi. {2x}

Elle vous emprunte un cierge à Pâques
Vous le rend à la Trinité.
Non, non, non, ne me dites pas que
C'est normal de tant le garder.
Aux obsèques d'un con célèbre,
Sur la bière, ayant aperçu, {2x}
Un merveilleux cierge funèbre,
Elle partit à cheval dessus. {2x}

Son mari, pris dans la tempête
La Paimpolaise était en train
De vouer, c'était pas si bête,
Un cierge au patron des marins.
Ce pieux flambeau qui vacille
Mélanie se l'est octroyé, {2x}
Alors le saint, cet imbécile,
Laissa le marin se noyer. {2x}

Les bons fidèles qui désirent
Garder pour eux, sur le chemin
Des processions, leur bout de cire
Doiv'nt le tenir à quatre mains,
Car quand elle s'en mêl', sainte vierge,
Elle cause un désastre, un malheur. {2x}
La Saint-Barthélemy des cierges,
C'est le jour de la Chandeleur. {2x}

Souvent quand elle les abandonne,
Les cierges sont périmés;
La saint' famill' nous le pardonne
Plus moyen de les rallumer.
Comme ell' remue, comme elle se cabre,
Comme elle fait des soubresauts, {2x}
En retournant au candélabre,
Ils sont souvent en p'tits morceaux. {2x}

Et comme elle n'est pas de glace,
Parfois quand elle les restitue
Et qu'on veut les remettre en place,
Ils sont complètement fondus.
Et comme en outre elle n'est pas franche,
Il arrive neuf fois sur dix {2x}
Qu'sur un chandelier à sept branches
Elle n'en rapporte que six. {2x}

Mélanie à l'heure dernière
A peu de chances d'être élue;
Aux culs bénits de cett' manière
Aucune espèce de salut.
Aussi, chrétiens, mes très chers frères,
C'est notre devoir, il est temps, {2x}
De nous employer à soustraire
Cette âme aux griffes de Satan. {2x}

Et je propose qu'on achète
Un cierge abondamment béni
Qu'on fera brûler en cachette
En cachette de Mélanie.
En cachette car cette salope
Serait fichue d'se l'enfoncer {2x}
Dedans ses trompes de Fallope,
Et tout s'rait à recommencer. {2x}",Mélanie

Chez les enfants de chœur le malin s'insinue

Il paraît que, levant au ciel un œil complice,
Elle dit ""Bravo, Seigneur, c'est du joli travail!""
Puis qu'elle ajoute avec encore plus de malice
""La cambrure des reins, ça, c'est une trouvaille!""

La voix énamouré' des anges qui soupirent
Et celle de la sœur criant "" Encore! Encore!""
Et les enfants de chœur, les malheureux, transpirent

Et monsieur le curé, que ces bruits turlupinent,
Se dit avec raison que le brave Jésus
Avec sa tête, hélas! déjà chargé' d'épines,
N'a certes pas besoin d'autre chose dessus.
Et les enfants de chœur, branlant du chef, opinent

Tout ça, c'est des faux bruits, des ragots, des sornettes,
De basses calomnies par Satan répandues.
Pas plus d'accroche-cœurs sous la blanche cornette
Que de queue de cheval, mais un crâne tondu.
Et les enfants de chœur en font, une binette

Pas de troubles penchants dans ce cœur rigoriste,
Sous cet austère habit pas de rubans suspects.
On ne verra jamais la corne au front du Christ,
Le veinard sur sa croix peut s'endormir en paix,
Et les enfants de chœur se masturber, tout tristes",La Religieuse

Maxime le Forestier,"Sauf dans le cas fréquent, hélas
Où ce sont de vrais dégueulasses
On ne devrait perdre jamais
Ses père et mère, bien sûr, mais

A moins d'être un petit malin
Qui meurt avant d'être orphelin
Ou un infortuné bâtard
Ça vous pend au nez tôt ou tard

Quand se drapant dans un linceul
Ses parents le laissent tout seul
Le petit orphelin, ma foi
Est bien à plaindre toutefois

Sans aller jusqu'à décréter
Qu'il devient un enfant gâté
Disons que dans son affliction
Il trouve des compensations

D'abord au dessert aussitôt
La meilleure part du gâteau
Et puis plus d'école pardi
La semaine aux quatre-jeudis

On le traite comme un pacha
A sa place on fouette le chat
Et le trouvant très chic en deuil
Les filles lui font des clins d'œil

Il serait par trop saugrenu
D'énumérer par le menu
Les faveurs et les passe-droits
Qu'en l'occurrence on lui octroie

Tirant même un tel bénéfice
En perdant leurs parents, des fils
Dénaturés regrettent de
N'en avoir à perdre que deux

Hier j'ai dit à un animal
De flic qui me voulait du mal
Je suis orphelin, savez-vous?
Il me répondit Je m'en fous

J'aurais eu quarante ans de moins
Je suis sûr que par les témoins
La brute aurait été mouchée
Mais ces lâches n'ont pas bougé

Aussi mon enfant si tu dois
Être orphelin, dépêche-toi
Tant qu'à perdre tes chers parents
Petit, n'attends pas d'être grand

L'orphelin d'âge canonique
Personne ne le plaint bernique
Et pour tout le monde il demeure
Orphelin de la onzième heure

Celui qui a fait cette chanson
A voulu dire à sa façon
Que la perte des vieux est par fois
Perte sèche, blague à part

Avec l'âge c'est bien normal
Les plaies du cœur guérissent mal
Souventes fois même, salut
Elles ne se referment plus

C'était toi la pluie et le beau temps

Mais le temps passe et fauche à l'aveuglette

Tu brûlais mes chansons, crachais sur mes violettes
Et faisais des misaires à mes chats

Le comble enfin, misérable salope
Comme il ne restait plus rien dans le garde-manger
T'as couru sans vergogne, et pour une escalope
Te jeter dans le lit du boucher

On était malhabiles
Elle était difficile
La fugue d'autrefois
Qu'on jouait tous les trois

Eléonore attaquait le thème au piano
On trouvait ça tellement beau
Qu'on en arrêtait de jouer pour l'écouter
Elle s'arrêtait brusquement et nous regardait
Du haut de son tabouret
Et disait reprenez mi fa mi fa mi ré

C'était toujours la même
Mais on l'aimait quand même
La fugue d'autrefois
Qu'on jouait tous les trois

On était malhabiles
Elle était difficile
La fugue d'autrefois
Qu'on jouait tous les trois

Souviens-toi qu'un violon fut jeté sur le sol
Car c'était toujours le sol
Qui gênait Nicolas quand il était bémol
Quand les voisins commençaient à manifester
C'était l'heure du goûter
Salut Jean-Sébastien et à jeudi prochain

Un jour Eléonore a quitté la maison
Emportant le diapason
Depuis ce jour nous n'accordons plus nos violons
L'un après l'autre nous nous sommes dispersés
La fugue seule est restée
Et chaque fois que je l'entends c'est le printemps",La Petite Fugue
Maxime le Forestier,"Petits chats, petits rats avec nos frêles os
Nous allions à l'école de danse
À la barre de chêne se pliaient les roseaux
De nos corps amoureux de cadences
La danse est une cage où l'on apprend l'oiseau
Nous allions à l'école de danse

Face à la grande glace, petits canards patauds
Nous vivions pour le bonheur insigne
De voir nos blancs tutus reflétés par les eaux
Du lac noir où meurt la "" Mort du Cygne ""
La danse est une étoile, qu'elle est loin, qu'elle est haut
Sur les pointes on lui faisait des signes

Dans un coin du studio, le piano convolait
Hardiment vers des prouesses russes
Et le plancher des vaches de son mieux décollait
Sous nos pieds ivres de sauts de puces
La danse est une bête, la sueur est son lait
Le désir, sa coutume et ses us

Alors, chacun les bras en chœur, corps à couteaux tirés,
Se tendait vers la ligne suprême,
Vers les extrémités d'un ciel, d'un soleil délivré
De la nuit et de ses théorèmes
La danse est un espace où les ronds sont carrés
Où le temps, ô miracle, nous aime...

Sur des rythmes d'Astaire, des tambours brésiliens
Elle danse, la Danse, elle danse
Pas par pas, bond par bond, elle brise les liens
De nos poids épris de transcendance
Paysanne est la danse, le cosmos est son grain
En sabots de satin, le balance !

Petits chats, petits rats avec nos frêles os
Nous allions à l'école de danse
À la barre de chêne se pliaient les roseaux
De nos corps amoureux de cadences

Si tu m'avais pas fait faux bond

Si la vie s'était comportée mieux

Les paires de gants, les paires de claques
Elle aurait surement partagé

As you fought all the sounds in me
At the time of escapades up in the mountains
The sound of the bells embraced me

I came by to tinkle in your garden
As you taught all the kids to shoot
At the time of escapades down in the valley
You fired a velvet gun

My storehouse eyes, my Arabian bells
My warehouse legs, my Arabian chimes
Should I leave them by your gun?
Or, long-faced Lady, should I run?

Lady, should I run?

I came by to close your open window
And to dive in your open sea
At the time of escapades out in the desert
You cradled our velvet son",Velvet Son

Were sumptuous rainfalls
Dreary whispering of how you love
Sun-baked objects
It's a little strange how you walk
And I still hear your withered talk
I am blooming
I am blooming
Without you

You've lost your tears in a vale of dust
You're a wilted flower
How could I now miss your face
As I'm watered in a shower?
It's a little strange how you walk
And I still hear your withered talking",Wilted Flower
Maximilian Hecker,"There was this day when I had found you
At first you smiled but then you fell blue
Your eagle eyes they seemed to ask me
""Are you my thorn bush or my fruit tree?""

My love is growing though you'll never be the end of
Longing, my dear
And I am trying to find the answers to the questions
That you shouldn't ask, my dear

And then this day when I had touched you
I loved it and I hoped you did, too
Your misty eyes they seemed to wonder
""Are you my right choice or my blunder?""

You say
""How long will you care?
How much can you bear?
And can I lay all my fears in your hands?
Will you carry me?
Will you stay with me?
And can I lay my whole life in your hands?""

At last the day when I had lost you
Oh, both our hearts were breaking in two
Your saucer eyes they seemed to query
Say, have you ever really loved me?",The End of Longing

Miss Underwater, give up

Maximilian Hecker,"We moved into this house called love
Right at the crack of dawn
And cheered to praise the Lord above
""Oh, Father, we're reborn""

""This is our home and here's my plan""
She said to me outright
""Let's never leave this house again""
And locked all doors and lights

But suddenly I felt the need
To run and leave our space

It had become a cage indeed
There was no beauty's trace

But when she said ""You're free to go""
I felt I want to stay
I saw again our house's glow
And doubts they slipped away

Right at the crack of gloom

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Maximillian Colby,"One
Testimony in trials that never got heard

My lovers teeth are white geese flying above me
My lovers muscles are rope ladders under my hands

We were driving home slow
My lover and I, across the long Bay Bridge,
One February midnight, when midway
Over in the far left lane, I saw a strange scene:

One small young man standing by the rail,
And in the lane itself, parked straight across
As if it could stop anything, a large young
Man upon a stalled motorcycle, perfectly

Relaxed as if he'd stopped at a hamburger stand;
He was wearing a peacoat and levis, and
He had his head back, roaring, you
Could almost hear the laugh, it

Was so real.
""Look at that fool,"" I said, ""in the
Middle of the bridge like that,"" a very
Womanly remark.

Then we heard the meaning of the noise
Of metal on a concrete bridge at 50
Miles an hour, and the far left lane
Filled up with a big car that had a

Motorcycle jammed on its front bumper, like
The whole thing would explode; the friction
Sparks shot up bright orange for many feet
Into the air, and the racket still sets
My teeth on edge.

When the car stopped we stopped parallel
And Wendy headed for the callbox while I
Ducked across those 6 lanes like a mouse
In the bowling alley. ""Are you hurt?"" I said,

The middle-aged driver had the greyest black face,
""I couldn't stop, I couldn't stop, what happened?""

Then I remembered. ""Somebody, "" I said, ""was on
The motorcycle."" I ran back,
One block? two blocks? The space for walking
On the bridge is maybe 18 inches, whoever

Engineered this arrogance. in the dark
Stiff wind it seemed I would
Be pushed over the rail, would fall down
Screaming onto the hard surface of

The bay, but I did not, I found the tall young man
Who thought he owned the bridge, now lying on
His stomach, head cradled in his broken arm.

He had glasses on, but somewhere he had lost
Most of his levis, where were they?
And his shoes. Two short cuts on his buttocks,
That was the only mark except his thin white
Seminal tubes were all strung out behind; no
Child left in him; and he looked asleep.

I plucked wildly at his wrist, then put it
Down; there were two long haired women
Holding back the traffic just behind me
With their bare hand, the machines came
Down like mad bulls, I was scared, much

More than usual, I felt easily squished
Like the earthworms crawling on a busy
Sidewalk after the rain; I wanted to
Leave. And met the driver, walking back.

""The guy is dead."" I gripped his hand,
The wind was going to blow us off the bridge.

""Oh my God"" he said, ""haven't I had enough
Trouble in my life?"" He raised his head,
And for a second was enraged and yelling,
At the top of the bridge ""I was just driving

Home!"" His head fell down. ""My God, and
Now I've killed somebody.""

I looked down at my own peacoat and levis,
Then over at the dead man's friend, who
Was bawling and blubbering, what they would
Call hysteria in a woman. ""It isn't possible""

He wailed, but it was possible, it was
Indeed, accomplished and unfeeling, snoring
In its peacoat, and without its levis on.

He died laughing: that's a fact.

I had a woman waiting for me,
In her car and in the middle of the bridge,
I'm frightened, I said.
I'm afraid, he said, stay with me,

Please don't go, stay with me, be
My witness ""No,"" I said, ""I'll be your
Witness later,"" and I took his name
And number, ""but I can't stay with you,

I'm too frightened of the bridge, besides
I have a woman waiting
And no license
And no tail lights ""

So I left
As I have left so many of my lovers.

We drove home
Shaking, Wendy's face greyer
Than any white person's I have ever seen.
Maybe he beat his wife, maybe he once

Drove taxi, and raped a lover
Of mine how to know these things?
We do each other in, that's a fact.

Who will be my witness?
Death wastes our time with drunkenness
And depression
Death, who keeps us from our

Lovers.
He had a woman waiting for him,
I found when I called the number
Days later

""Where is he"" she said, ""he's disappeared/""
""He'll be all right"" I said, ""we could
Have hit the guy as easy as anybody, it
Wasn't anybody's fault, they'll know that,""

Women so often say dumb things like that,
They teach us to be sweet and reassuring,
And say ignorant things, because we don't invent
The crime, the punishment, the bridges

That same week I looked into the mirror
And nobody was there to testify;
How clear, and unemployed queer woman
Makes no witness at all,
Nobody at all was there for
Those two questions: what does
She do, and who is she married to?

I am the woman who stopped on the bridge
And this is the man who was there
Our lovers teeth are white geese flying
Above us, but we ourselves are
Easily squished.

Keep the women small and weak
And off the street, and off the
Bridges, that's the way, brother
One day I will leave you there,
As I have left you there before,
Working for death.

We found out later
What we left him to.
Six big policemen answered the call,
All white, and no child in them.
They put the driver up against his car
And beat the hell out of him.
What did you kill that poor kid for?
You mutherfucking nigger.
That's a fact.

Death only uses violence
When there is any kind of resistance,
The rest of the time a slow
Weardown will do.

They took him to 4 different hospitals
Til they got a drunk test report to fit their
Case, and held him five days in jail
Without a phone call.
How many lovers have we left.

There are as many contradictions to the game,
As there are players.
A woman is talking to death,
Though talk is cheap, and like takes a long time
To make
Right. He got a cheesy lawyer
Who had him cop a plea, 15 to 20
Instead of life
Did I say life?

The arrogant young man who thought he
Owned the bridge, and fell asleep on it
He died laughing: that's a fact.
The driver sits out his time
Off the street somewhere,
Does he have the most vacant of
Eyes, will he die laughing?


A table they made and on it was laid a baby we gave and I'm so dry mud cracked I maybe we deny where these walls won't let go of my eyes we made a circle of smoke on a train please same me from saying it was easy we were driving across the bridge so slow he lost his child in the snow",Balance

And its no surprise I'm standing still,
Another minute more is all I need,
I'll never have enough,
This room gets so cold in the winter,
What will it take to heat this house?
I just want to feel comfortable,
When there's only the two of us in my bed,
My foot nearly brushes your leg,
I can't draw it away,
I can't push it forward,

I suppose its because its so big and expansive,
When a long stranded cloud sits just above the horizon,
Leaving a strip of clear blue beneath it,
It becomes the panorama,
And you turn your head 360 degrees,
And the same line follows you round,
If the land is sufficiently flat,
Really nothing can be compared to it

Stretching out my palms to save you,

There it is again that lock of hair

Distract us against our will...

Like little pills cloud water
Dissolving inch by inch
Separating a fraction further

You helped to shape this space
We'd gaze at dancers
The view it fluctuates

Flattened bodies blown on the floor
Within a rectangle of cool green lines
We watched them in the wall
We breath beside each other

The stars, our landmarks
And we don't use them
The stars, our landmarks
You can't swing from them

I wish this was an endurance test
But there are no limits
I sent a letter to my own address
While you lived in it

You used to drink from that glass
Decorated in Scandinavia
You nearly ironed me out
And now I've changed my behavior

This morning I saw a blue metal star
I was on tiptoes high above the back yard
Competing with the real thing
It ends up dominating

The stars, our landmarks
And we don't use them
The stars, our landmarks
You can't swing from them

Everyone's got their own idea
Of Utopia and why we're here

And we don't use them

Who's going to know that you passed them around
A hundred years from today!
Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen
You're nearer heaven on Mother Earth's green
If you had millions what would they all mean
A hundred years from today
So laugh and sing, make love the thing
Be happy while you may
There's always one, beneath the sun
Who's bound to make you feel that way
The moon is shining, and that's a good sign
Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine
Remember, darling, we won't see it shine

Maxine Sullivan,"Some day, when I'm awfully low,
When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight.

You're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Lovely, never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.
Won't you please arrange it?
Cause I love you, just the way you look tonight.

Maxine Sullivan,"Every time we say goodbye, I die a little,
Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know.
Think so little of me, they allow you to go.
When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,
I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to minor,
Every time we say goodbye.

Brought the sun and the flowers where there use to be rain

Today I'm a part of you dear
Yes, my lonely nights are through dear
Since you say you are mine, all the time
What a difference a day made
Now there's a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy since that moment of bliss

It's a good thing or it's bad,

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,

Maxwell,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",W/As My Girl

Paroles Brigitte Fontaine
Musique Maya Barsony / Matthieu Chédid

Une sorte de greluche
Teint plâtre et robe sang
Entrouvre la peluche
D’un rideau de beuglant
L’auditoire s’explose
C’est enfin le moment
Où la divine chose
Va cracher son talent

Refrain :
Vas-y vas-y, chante, beuglante, vas-y chante

En effet elle entame
En entrant dans l’arène
Un affolant ramdam
En pur polystyrène
Sa voix rauque ou suave
Revue et corrigée
Se contorsionne et bave
Sur le client pâmé

Refrain

Elle vomit des mots tocs
Sur des airs comme il faut
Tango Funky et rock
En palpant ses lolos
L’atmosphère très hot
Monte de vingt degrés
Quand elle saisit les notes 
Perchées comme un trophée

Refrain

Bravo pour les magouilles
Bravo pour les pétasses
Qui vont traîner leurs couilles
En or dans les palaces",La Beuglante

Mayan,"I am inflexible
There is no way
To break my discipline and strength
My endless loyalty
For my fatherland
Fills me with dignity
That no one understands

When do we get some explanations?
About what happened there at last
This deprivation
By the pride of our nation
This is the reason to conceal

Serving the Nation
I'd give my life for
With no regrets

Rule out the predators at every cost
I feel no pity for all the renegades who died

The pride of the soul
Forever guilty
The legion of the fall
Into disgrace

Families have been torn apart and mourn
The silence of defeat
A thorn in the flesh
One deep scratch
But the lies live on

When do we get some explanations?
About what happened there at last
This deprivation
By the pride of our nation
This is the reason to
Turn around the point of view

We are forsaken
By each and every one of you
Don't forget what you've failed to do

Watch out
We are forsaken
Beware
By every one of you
Hold on
Don't forget that you have failed in every way

The pride of the soul
Forever guilty
The legion of the fall
Into disgrace

Families have been torn apart and mourn
The silence of defeat
A thorn in the flesh
One deep scratch
But the lies live on

When do we get some explanations?
About what happened there at last

Deprivation
No confrontation
This is the reason to march on
Stand ground
Beat down
And conceal",Bite the Bullet
Mayane Delem,"C'était encore hier
On a laissé nos terres
Nous sommes partis pour ailleurs
On parlait d'un monde en fleurs
La tête me tourne dans ce monde ailleurs
J'ai tout laissé là-bas, leurs visages, leurs voix
Qui sans cesse me détourne de ce monde ailleurs
Où j'aimerais sentir parfois que je suis chez moi
aujourd'hui dans ces rues
Où des inconnus se ruent
Rien ne semble pour moi
Mais j'aimerais tant qu'on me voit
La tête me tourne dans ce monde ailleurs
J'ai laissé là-bas, leurs visages, leurs voix
Qui sans cesse me détournent de ce monde ailleurs
Où j'aimerais sentir parfois que je suis chez moi
Ici je n'ai pas de repère
Ici tout est à refaire
Pour toucher du rêve
Qu'un jour on se lève",Ce Monde Ailleurs
Mayday,"I'm trying to remember where I went wrong
Only want to talk you into coming
I won't even ask you where you've been
Or who you've been staying with
Because since you've been away
This house is a barren place
The phone it just doesn't ring

Come home, Come home
Come home, baby
Come home, Come home
Come home, baby

I have imagined a thousands days
You come back through my door
Draw the bath so very warm
I will cut the wood
And put the supper on
And to pour the blood red wine
To warm and to welcome you, back to my bed
Back to my bed

Come home, Come home
Come home, baby
Come home, Come home
Come back to me

Come home, Come home
Come home, baby

All the days, I couldn't count all the days
That have passed without even unsettling the dust in this room
Every time a train passes
It shakes this tiny house
To remind me that I am alone
Shaking without your love

Come home, Come home
Come home, baby
Come home, Come home
Come home, baby

Come home, Come home
Come back to me
",Come Home
Mayday Parade,"Tonight is the one thing left
And I haven't said it yet, I'm falling
And the writings on the wall

Today was misery
And I just can't believe this happened
And I finally broke down (finally broke down)
She held onto my heart
But now my only star is falling
And it's burning to the ground

Now I'm crying out

Secret love, my escape
Take me far, far away
Secret love, are you there
Will you answer my prayer
Please take me anywhere but here
Anywhere but here

You're all I've got right now
No one else figures out this feeling
And how lonely it can get (how lonely it can get)
These words can cut right through
'Cause all along I knew you're sorry
But you haven't said it yet

But I won't forget

Secret love, my escape
Take me far, far away
Secret love, are you there
Will you answer my prayer
Please take me anywhere but here
Anywhere but here

When we're together
Thoughts of her disappear
If I fell to pieces
You'd heal this pain I feel

Secret love, my escape
Take me far far away
Secret love, are you there
Will you answer my prayer

Secret love, my escape
Take me far, far away
Secret love, are you there
Will you answer my prayer
Please take me anywhere but here
Anywhere but here",Anywhere But Here
Mayday Parade,"It all goes back to the first kiss
It was the one I thought I'd never miss
Maybe we were one of the lucky ones
Maybe I'm just not quite strong enough

This was supposed to be the easy part
But breaking down is what I found hard
Now I'm wearing this smile that I don't believe in
Inside, I feel like screaming

She gave me every reason to believe
I'd found the one
But my doubts, somehow
They sold me out

I'm bruised and scarred
Save me from this broken heart
All my love will slowly fade and fall apart
Someone please sing this lovesick melody
Call my name if you're afraid
I'm just a kiss away

I'm finding out in the hardest way
The consequence of every mistake I've ever made
Baby, what's it like to be alone? (Baby, what's it like to be alone?)
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know

She gave me every reason to believe
I'd found the one
But my doubts, somehow
They sold me out

I'm bruised and scarred
Save me from this broken heart
All my love will slowly fade and fall apart
Someone please sing this lovesick melody
Call my name if you're afraid
I'm just a kiss away

So, baby, be honest
Is this what you wanted?
We lost where we started
And found out much more than we wanna know (More than we wanna know)
About how we're letting go, oh (About how we're letting go)

So, baby, be honest
Is this what you wanted?
We lost where we started
And found out much more than we wanna know

I'm bruised and scarred
Save me from this broken heart

Mayday Parade,"Jennifer, the party's over,
I didn't think you'd make it through the night.
Everybody's gone,
But you're alright.

Sweetie, now, obviously,
You know it's not obvious to me
Why it's not plain enough to see.

You're falling, baby,
I've been waiting,
You took the long way home.
In that dress, it makes me crazy.
I'm not the only one.
It's cold outside.
Keep your heart open wide,
Save it for somebody who cares.
Somebody who cares.

Jennifer, the weekend's over,
But at least you made it through with style.
It all runs together after a while.

Tell me, baby, is it hard to admit?
Do you remember what you did,
Or where we've been?

You're falling, baby,
I've been waiting,
You took the long way home.
In that dress, it makes me crazy,
I'm not the only one.
It's cold outside.
Keep your heart open wide,
Save it for somebody who cares.

You don't have to walk alone tonight.
I don't have to be a gentleman.
You don't have to say a single word,
Or make believe that we could be ""just friends.""

You're falling, baby,
I've been waiting:
You took the long way home.

Mayday Parade,"We tried to fight for what we thought
That we believed in
Maybe it was all for nothing
(I bet that it was all for nothing)
So we drive, 'cause we like to be alone
There's nowhere for us to go
There's nowhere for us to go

How can you think
That any of this was easy
With all the friends
I've lost along the way?
When this is over
We're all getting older now
And we all play a part in it
Innocence is falling
Can you hear them calling now?
But I'll be by your side until the end

We tried to fight
I guess sometimes you find it's pointless
As long as you can live with yourself
(Tell me how you live with yourself)
So it's time that we take the open road
There's nowhere for us to go
There's nowhere for us to go

How can you think
That any of this was easy
With all the friends
I've lost along the way?
When this is over
We're all getting older now

But I'll be by your side until the end

Let's make this count
We're not alone, not alone

Or anything that I was told it'd be
New York, you know you make my heart skip
In my dreams, I make it in to Vegas

Seattle hits me every time
I can't get Chicago off my mind
New Jersey taught me how to let go
And I've learned it's all that I need to know

In this moment, we're connected
If we fall, we fall together

Get up, get up
Sing it like you're screaming at me
Get up, get up
I love the way you make it look so easy

Show me what you got now
Let's go, let's go
Get up, get up

It's who you're with

Mayday Parade,"Oh, Florida, please be still tonight
Don't disturb this love of mine
Look how she's so serene
You've gotta help me out
And count the stars to form the lines
And find the words we'll sing in time
I wanna keep her dreaming
It's my one wish
I won't forget this

I'm outdated, overrated
Morning seems so far away

So I'll sing a melody
An hope to God she's listening
Sleeping softly while I sing
And I'll be your memories
Your lullaby for all the times
Hoping that my voice could get it right

If luck is on my side tonight
My clumsy tongue will make it right
And wrists that touch
It isn't much but it's enough
To form imaginary lines
Forget your scars
We'll forget mine
The hours change so fast
Oh, God, please make this last

'Cause I'm outdated, overrated
Morning seems so far away

So I'll sing a melody
And hope to god she's listening
Sleeping softly while I sing
And I'll be your memories
Your lullaby for all the times
Hoping that my voice could get it right
Could get it right

You could crush me
Please don't crush me
'Cause baby I'm a dreamer for sure
And I won't let you down

Mayday Parade,"Baby, I sorely miss the vibrant gleam that's in your eyes
I'll write a song about it
And maybe if the melody's just right
I hope tonight it will find you
It will remind you

But what's holding me back is the thought of time we never had
My world's hanging by three words that I can't bear to say

When you hear this chorus
Do you miss the way the world was spinning for us?
Do you hurt the way that I do?
After all this time you leave me broken
This song is every word I left unspoken
When you hear this, girl, I'm hoping that you'll think of us
That you'll think of us

Baby, I told myself that I'll be fine but it's a lie
I don't wanna talk about it
Memories, oh they cut like knives
Deep inside I'm falling
Baby, catch me if you can

What's holding me back is the thought of time we never had
My world's hanging by three words that I can't bear to say

Mayday Parade,"I look back to the one and only summer time
And my girl was the envy of every friend of mine
She slept safely in my arms
We were so young and invincible

Closed lips, she was never one to kiss and tell
Those trips in the summer never went so well
Young love was such dumb love
Call it what you want it was still enough

And you're still out of my reach
And you're still all of the things
That I want in my life
How could I ask you to leave me?

And we were just kids in love
The summer was full of mistakes we wouldn't learn from
The first kiss stole the breath from my lips
Why did the last one tear us apart?

Our breath smelled of cigarettes and alcohol
We'd walk down the beach counting every star
Our hearts beat inside our chest
Leaving us gasping for every breath

Her smile with the wind blowing through her hair
Was so contagious in the air
So satisfying and I'm still smiling

And you're still out of my reach
And you're still all of the things
That I want in my life
How could I ask you to leave me?


And we were just kids in love
The summer was full of mistakes we wouldn't learn from
The first kiss stole the breath from my lips
Why did the last one tear us apart

We're falling down, can we pick up the pieces?
We're at an all time low, how do we get it back?
We're falling down, can we pick up the pieces?

We're falling down, can we pick up the pieces now?

And we were just kids in love
The summer was full of mistakes we wouldn't learn from

This wasn't meant for her too
She struggles to find herself in time
But she can barely move
Just try and get up
You've gotta slowly brush off
I know that words aren't enough
But you're better than this

Save your heart
For someone that's worth dying for
Don't give it away
Torn apart
Never getting what you've been crying for
It's always the same

She turns the pages everyday
Just to change the mood
But every chapter reads the same

Mayday Parade,"Torn in two, she lies awake,
The moon lights up her room like day
Another night she spends alone,
Without his touch, her skin so cold.

The blood that's running through her veins,
With every beat there's no escape,
Lost in everything she trusts,
Still can't seem to get enough.

Even though the world she loves,
It won't ever be the way it was,
And his heart of stone left hers breaking.

Every night she cries and dies a little more each time,
Say you love me (You love me),
Nothing left inside,
Say you love me,
And the silence will set her free.

Memories they take her back,
Every moment fades to black,
Every kiss and every taste,
She wishes time would ease the pain.

Even though the world she loves,
It won't ever be the way it was,
And her heart is weak, her hands are shaking.

Every night she cries,
And dies a little more each time,
Say you love me (You love me),
Nothing left inside,
Say you love me,
And the silence will set her free.

Keep feelin' like we flyin' in it
You say you won't blink scared you'll miss it
Turn up something too explicit
She say that she can't wait to escape this town
And it's all too familiar right now
And I freeze when the smoke sneak out my mouth
But same thing that don't matter right now
It don't matter right now
In the bag got enough for a smile
So we slide when they ain't lookin' out
Sneaking out for a drive in the clouds

On a high ride, yes a high ride tonight
Take the long way just to dodge these flashing lights
On a high ride, yes a high ride tonight
Take the long way just to dodge these flashing lights
These flashing lights, These flashing lights
We take the long way just to dodge these flashing lights
These flashing lights, These flashing lights
We take the long way just to dodge these ah

Underneath the ragtop
Two a.m. in the middle of the road, road
Thinkin' this should be the last high
But you never seem to want to let it go, go
So let it fall to the floor
So we can pick it up get taught for some more
Phone calls from the lord, stars in the North and it's hard to ignore
That everyone of them felt farther before
Do you wanna take a ride on the skyline
Base underneath us fraying my mind
Walking on the clouds and it's feeling quite fine
You rockin' high heels and the robolo life
This could be another long ride off a short ledge
We might just never come back to the floor again
What you lookin' for? We don't need rolls
You know the window carry us where ever we go
High ride, this is my life
Gettin' by I'm, feelin' like time
Don't apply now, we above that
Never come down, never come back

On a high ride, yes a high ride tonight
Take the long way just to dodge these flashing lights
On a high ride, yes a high ride tonight
Take the long way just to dodge these flashing lights
These flashing lights, These flashing lights
We take the long way just to dodge these flashing lights
These flashing lights, These flashing lights
We take the long way just to dodge these ah

I'm on my way, on my way you know
I'm on display like an animal
Please don't blame all them chemicals
The ceiling's never felt so low
Oh, oh, oh

On a high ride, yes a high ride tonight
Take the long way just to dodge these flashing lights
On a high ride, yes a high ride tonight
Take the long way just to dodge these flashing lights
These flashing lights, These flashing lights
We take the long way just to dodge these flashing lights

Mayday!,"Is anybody out there?
Is anybody down to run?
Spectators in their lawn chairs
While we're waiting for the starting gun

We all know why we're here

Is anybody watchin'?
Is anybody seein' this?
All I heard was the explosion
And now I can't even feel my fist
Smoke all around my eyelids
Lady can't find her kid
It's so loud it seems silent
But I'm still trying to reach the end

I can't go down
The flight carries me from the sound

It's Murs, 9th Wonder
Murs 3:16, the 9th Edition
Shut your fat mouth, and listen

[Verse 1]
Anticipation got the deck stacked against me since the outset
9th got 'em fiending for an instrumental version of an album that ain't out yet
But now it's my outlet, and it feels so good to them punk fans
When I'm still so hood, so good it's ridiculous, still iniculous
That means three times doper than your favorite mc riding round with a chauffeur
These niggas need Jesus, fuck it, niggas need Oprah
All this killing and this pimping and these foul ways of living
See, everyone's forgetting that the struggle's not over
I got sober, then got drunk again
Got my boy from Carolina, picked up the pen
Threw my nuts on the finish line, I +cum+ to win
While you nothin' to lose, I'll shake you out your shoes
with ease, with moves parallel to those and other three
Couldn't wait for George to make the new Star Wars scene
So I made my own episode 3:16
To answer all the rumors that been shooting through your group
Yes 9th really does make these beats on Fruity Loops
But what does that matter?, this is more than music
By buying this disc you have bought into a movement
Not a revolutionary, nothing but the truth I carry
change if you want to change, that karma is for you to carry
All I'm trying to do is lighten your load
So in between I'm getting faded, some of y'all getting blowed
But I couldn't fall off and lose sight of my goals
So I got sober, got drunk again

I still hear your seawinds blowing
I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawaves crashin
While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run

I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying

I know you knew it from the moment that you felt that sky
And I know that it's hard for you to understand it
I hope you ready now 'cause we'll be up all night

Ride down the block 'cause this party's just starting
The women, the liquors is bout to get hot
Imma open a tab and then get me a shot 'cause I'm feeling like shit's 'bout to pop

(Something in the air)
And I been peeping it in
Vice city, time to get busy when the season begins
Oh, excuse me, the season's never seeming to end
So grab a friend and let 'em know I ain't quit
That we got (something in the air)
And it's too damn catchy
So when you come to visit, please come and get at me
The women up in here are like Venus de Milo
They [?] to their chests and they are showing their thighs so
We line up at the border to get it in (slam it)
If I don't even notify my kin (damn it)
I think that I could probably get you in to the palace of the sin
Ah, it's happening again it's (something in the air)
And nobody's complaining 'cause even here the visitors are practically famous
The liquor flow free, and the Devil's contagious
When a place outrageous, I dare say it's (something in the air)

Something in the air got me all right
It's safe sex mixed with a little vice
Best thing's free if you pay the right price
Yeah, hope it's cool, we'll be up all night
Because it's something in the air, city's alive
We up in here trying to have a good time
Fuck a dress code, wear what you like
We gon' work all day, so we can play all night
And yo there's something in the air
She's so excited, asking me if all her friends invited
Hit the DM and they all sliding
Tryna have a little fun, before the sun start shining
On the streets soaking up my eyelids
No sleep, lost track of time and
Everybody just be glad we riding
It's the reason we alive, thank God 'cause it's something in the air

Say go
Say when
In the wind we go
We toast to the game
No games
We both really grown
I’m sayin’ you playin’
I mean I dance
To my own beat to the beat now flip your hands and
Let the smoke burn
Lets the smoke burn in your vein
When it’s your turn hit it twice then say my name
Say my name say my name
Mind game like Candyman
Dark chocolate vanilla
I tell you this is Candy Land
This is candid camera there’s no pauses allowed
They don’t understand us because we wont turn it down
Middle fingers in the air
This is truth and double dare

Don't wanna hurt nobody

Mayer Hawthorne,"Friday night at the scene is bright at Avalon
Walked straight to the bar in her party dress, yes
Told the bartender pour her a shot
And make it strong
Because she needed cheering up
She proceeded to get drunk
You could see it tearing up in her eyes

But when she gets home, she puts her headphones on
She plays her favorite song and fades away
And when the musics on she can do no wrong
And she feels safe and calm and it's okay
And she says, ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
Ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
The world keeps turning, life goes on
Yeah she says, ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
Ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
The world keeps turning, life goes on

Night before had a date with a boy from Highland Park
Said he'd meet her at the diner at nine o'clock
Leather boots, eyeliner laid on extra dark
She got a table set for two
But he never made it through
And she tried to play it cool, as she cried

But when she gets home, she puts her headphones on
She plays her favorite song and fades away
And when the musics on she can do no wrong
And she feels safe and calm and it's okay
And she says, ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
Ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba
The world keeps turning, life goes on
Yeah she says, ba ba dum ba dee ah dum ba

Mayer Hawthorne,"She walks into the room and all the lights
Flicker violently
Keep your head down

She orders up a shot of Aberlour
The tender starts to pour
With trembling hands
They all understand
She spins her bar stool 'round and walks my way
And it's too late to pray
I hold my breath
Surrender to my death

And when she's got you in her arms it's like a lullaby
The sweetest song you've ever heard, that's my word
She'll make you feel like you're not just one of the other guys
But when you sleep you'll rest assured

Throw my heart away each Spring
Now a Spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to Winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it
Heard it before
And I know the score
And I decide that love is a bore
Love seem sure around the new year
Now it's April

Love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time
But what became of you, dear
Spring can really hang you up the most
Spring can really hang you up the most

Spring is here
There's no mistaken
Robins build their nest from coast to coast
My heart tries the same
So they won't hear it breaking
Spring can really hang you up the most

College boys are riding somewhere
Tender passion there it grows
But I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way
I'm holding the last
We had our day
Now that's all in the past
Spring came along
A season of song
For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most

All alone, the party's over
Winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover

For to tell you the truth
I've had quite a day too

Guess who I saw today, my dear?
I went in town to shop around for something new
And thought I'd stop and have a bite
When I was through

I looked around for someplace near
And it occurred to me where I had parked the car
There was a most attractive French cafe and bar
It really wasn't very far

The waiter showed me to a dark, secluded corner
And as my eyes became accustomed to the gloom
I saw two people at the bar who were so in love
That even I could spot it clear across the room

Maynard Ferguson,"Every man has a place, in his heart there's a space,
And the world can't erase his fantasies
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship fantasii

And we will live together, until the twelfth of never
Our voices will ring forever, as one

Every thought is a dream, rushing by in a stream,
Bringing life to our kingdom of doing

Our voices will ring together until the twelfth of never,
We all, will live forever, as one

Come see victory, in the land called fantasy
Loving life, a new decree, 
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty

Our minds will explore together, old worlds, we conquer, forever
We then, will expand love together, as one

Come to see, victory in a land called fantasy,
Loving life, for you and me, to behold, to your soul is ecstasy
You will find, other kind, that has been in search for you,
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize it's your life, now in review
And as you stay for the play, fantasy, has in store for you,
A glowing light will see you through

It's your day, shining day, all your dreams come true
As you glide, in your stride with the wind, as you fly away
Give a smile, from your lips, and say
I am free, yes I'm free, now I'm on my way",Fantasy
Maynard Ferguson,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

With those blues on parade

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,

And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan

You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue

Within our desert caravan",Caravan

Foaming like a wave 
On the ground around your knees 
And the birds, like tender babies in your hands 
And the old men playing checkers by the trees

There will be another song for me 
For I will sing it 
There will be another dream for me 
Someone will bring it 
I will drink the wine while it is warm 
And never let you catch me looking at the sun 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one 

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it 
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it 
I will have the things that I desire 
And my passion flow like rivers and the sky 
And after all the loves of my life

A man is born but he's no good no-how

I got my troubles and woe but sure as I know that Jordan will roll
I'll get along as long as a song is strong in my soul

I'll never know what makes the grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all

Maynard Ferguson,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You [#][*]

Que o dia escondeu
Guardando pra te dar

Volta do mar, desmaia o sol
E o barquinho a deslizar e a vontade de cantar
Céu tão azul, ilhas do sul
E o barquinho ao coração deslizando na canção
Tudo isso é paz, tudo isso traz

No estarías hoy sufriendo ni llorando
Por aquel humilde amor que yo te tuve

Pero tú me abandonaste por ser pobre
Te casaste con un viejo que es muy rico
Y llore, y llore y llore noche tras noche caray
Noche tras noche, caray noche tras noche

Ahora soy yo quien vive feliz
Forme un hogar cuando te perdí
Después, después yo te olvide y te perdone

Y ahora vives infeliz y desgraciada

Todo por casarte con un rico

Que daño puedo hacerte con quererte
Si no me quieres tú yo te comprendo
Perfectamente sé que no nací yo para ti
Pero que puedo hacer si ya te quiero

Déjame vivir de esta manera
Yo te quiero tal cual y sin condiciones
Sin esperar que un día tu me quieras como yo
Consciente estoy mi amor que nunca me querrás

Tal vez mañana yo despierte solo
Pero por el momento quiero estar soñando
No me despiertes tu no vez que así yo soy feliz
Consciente estoy mi amor que no eres para mi
No hay necesidad que me desprecies

Tal vez sería corazón
Que yo en tu lugar si te amaría

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Before the street fights the fire
Free in the world that you've given

Still calls
Afraid of the dark that surrounds me

Free in the wind that surrounds me
I'm not afraid to sleep in the night
Not afraid, 
To sleep in the night
Free like a bird of the holders
Holding the wake of the sun
I know the road that you send me
I know the way it leads to home
Real like the bones in my body
Real like the flesh that covers the grave
It's real, 
Like the flesh
That covers, The grave
Wait for the guards that you send me
Before I'll show myself, 
Wait for the storm that comes to me
Maybe I'll just change my mind

I'm not afraid to say I was wrong
I was wrong
Maybe I won't

and hangs there like a day old suicide

a stickey shower of radioactive moonbeams 
cascades from the tops of nearby urban structures
causing indescriminate loss of limb to several innocent passers by
as well as general madness all around
 
sample: ""hey"" 
I survey the damage from a blind alley doorway
to which i have been glued for most of the day
having been inadvertantly papered over by a bleary eyed bill poster
sometime before dawn

eventually i muster the energy to extricate myself from my predicament 
as it is time for me to make my apoiinted rounds 
of all the nearby potential sources of aluminum cans
it is my sworn duty to collect all the cans in the area
and convert them into us currency at a secret government installation
whose location is known only to me

later, having acquired enough money to keep myself in the lifestyle to which i am accustomed
i find myself back on the street 
i scan the crowds until i see someone who is obviously insane
and then i follow that person until they go into a building or get into a car
in order to make sure that they don't do anything crazy

while i am engaged in this pursuit 
a nonstop stream of firetrucks and police cars
race up and down the boulevard 
sirens blaring looking for
invisible emergencies no one seems to notice

after a while i move on to the rest of my agenda for the evening
scheduled activities inlcude a short but passionate affair with
a curvaceous bottle of my favorite alcoholic beverage

presently i find myself holding court from a bus stop on 
the corner of Commerce and Pearl
from whence i regale the passing crowds 
with my perceptive insights into the nature of reality 
an appreciative throng hangs on my every word

it begins to rain
but everyone is concentrating so intently on me 
that they are oblivious to the downpour

the water makes me light
i begin to levitate
i float up off the sidewalk and past the top of the telephone pole
a thousand eyes follow me upward
a big black cloud opens up 
and i zip through it at full tilt 
going faster all the time

did you come to the conclusion that truth is out of style?

well i was on my way to work one day when i spied a rocket ship
some aliens abducted me and took me on a trip
to a previous existence on another astral plane
i met a real nice lady there name shirley maclaine

the truth is not an obstacle for someone such as me, she said
because you see we all create our own reality
and if a problem should arise
the best thing you can say is
don't worry, be happy, and have a nice day

well i thanked her very kindly for the excellent advice
she said she'd bill me later at a reasonable price
then the aliens brought me back and beamed me down into this bar
but i could not go to work because bigfoot stole my car

MC Breed,"[Chorus]
I gotta get mine,you gotta get yours 
I gotta get mine,you gotta get yours 
I gotta get mine,you gotta get yours 
Get yours 

Smooth as a wanna be,for quickly you a gonna be 
(oh that's the way it is)
Fuck yea and that's the way its gonna be 
Why,puffin on a dank and drinking mad brew 
Taking names and after that I'm kickin' ass too. 
Breed,kinda of tha (can I get a rhyme to go) 
Hey yo Pac ill set back and design it slow. 
They hate to see a young nigga, come up
Another punk, run up
And have to get his, gun up
Cause um I aint takin no shorts, like a newport, 
Explortin' the fully joint and 
Explodin' on the whole court. 
And I don't wanna be,wanna be, nothin' like mike 
Cause even mike don't miss every itty bitty triflin 
And when you in the spotlight,you get um jocked right 
But your life's not tight. 
Buckin' anybody forbed mine 
When will they realize,
I'm set out to get mine 

[Chorus: x6]

I keep my mind on my money,money on my mind 
Finga' on the trigga, nigga, hand on my nine 
Smokin' blunts a skunk, makin' hoes of punks 
And only underground funk bumpin' outta my trunk 
Live my life as a hustla, high till I die 
Meetin' bitches, gettin' riches, miss me when lie 
Picture me living out my life as a busta 
I ratha' pop out a shot out my glock, and blast muthafuckas 
I live that thug life baby I'm hopeless, chokin' off indo 
Tryin' to keep my focus 
Don't let that bullshit worry me,
Fuck the fame, I'm true to the game 
Till they bury me 
God gave me game so I'm hustlin', 
Pour out some liquor for my niggas 
2pac is still strugglin' 
My niggga breed new the time, 
Whether its rhyme or crime,
Nigga, I gotta get mine 

[Chorus: x6]

?
Now let me rushing threw your mind,
I'm balla is what I keep gettin' 
Every time I pick up the mic and start spittin' 
The sidewalk of new york will start bumpin' 
Jumpin' around,with the muthafuckin pound 
And I'm down to the fullest,and breakin' niggas ass off proper 
Did you right, that's right, cause I got you in my pocket again 
The new jacks, the new jacks, use to be my niggas when I ran way back when 
I boasted,and roasted, and coasted to the clinical cause ill do it again. 
Like precision, cut the two lines in the division. 
Plus,what I add loose as flutes. its gaming foe sale like prostitutes. 
I never had love for hoes, to put it blunt. 
They want me in the back,but bitch I'm in the front. 
Don't front,and really I don't need a reply. 
Pull yourself together as you pass me bye. 
I'm on a whole 'nother level,them hoes is left 
I told you before, keep ya pussy to yourself 
Goodbye,some many niggas lied to have 
Funny what a muthafucka' do for math 
I got rats caught up in my everyday actions,point 
Equal to your realist satisfaction 
Buckin' anybody that forbid mine 
When will they realize,
I'm set out to got mine 

[Chorus: x6]

Eternally thug nigga Hilfigure made by Tommy 
So when I speak hope to reach my ? mommy 
Oh come to poppy 
I love it when you sweat ? more peeps 
Until I come to wake no one can stop me 
My bump and grind 
Coming through ya every time 
Come get a blast of this through passion 
It'll blow your mind 
Hey throw up your ?

My name is MC Breed
I'm down with DJ Flash Technology, right?
And what we're doing here together as a team, the true-doers
Is what we call
Kicking it
Ah-ha, I said
We kicking it

Back in '86 when I started this
I said, the people told me: ""Breed, you're not an artist""
But now it's 1990, I'm serving em well
With the rhymes, rhythms, style and clientele

Concert after concert, one after the other
A man with the plan, plus a hustler undercover
A president, a guy of his own 
Said, I knew I was proper, and I knew I was strong

But all it takes is concentration, rhyme calculation
Enough crew members to carry a nation
To be exact, yo Jack, I rehearsed
The cat wants your tongue, but I'd be catching it first
And I'm kicking it

Said, it's real necessary, not lack of control
To be at the tip-top with nothing but bankroll
To develop an actual skill, son
You gotta be born a natural real one

Not high up on a pedestal, just a born idol
To me it's just a typical man-made title
To remain an architect and stand, in fact
You're startin to sweat, to eject is your best bet

Certified legal, not against the law
I'm not irrelevant, but terribly raw
I got on-the-job knowledge and puttin it on paper
No bun for those who b.s. the baker

That's right, the mack Eric Breed is all that 
It's pretty simple, not to mention a fact
Causing major upsets for you so-called vets 
Who was there in the beginning, now you're sitting in check
I'm kicking it

Yeah, I'm kickin it

[Talking]
Now this beat is so dope
Yo Flash, get busy one time
You know what I'm sayin?

Not once do I think I need to change my mind

Sit back, relax, Techno cuts of course

But his wax is just like 'jack, so then grind
It's like MC Kicking-It, one time like this and that
Step back, Jack, going black for black

Yeah, not wearing a Kangol, but maybe a cable
Thick shades, now you know, no looking like cool Moe

It's been seven years of the same old shit, had to put my foot down

Sellin tapes, now people want to celebrate
Get me for a high rate on my contract - gimme my shit back!
I ain't no fool tryin to make no quick moves
I can wait, cause I'm already seven years late
From that bullshit, in one ear and out the fuckin other
Always borrowin my money from my pops and my mother
The music seminars, 'Jack The Rapper', 3 years
Do nothin but talk shit and drink beers
Fuckin hoes after other niggas' shows
Ain't that kinda tired? 
Yo, I'm tired of that shit, I need to quit
But I'm gon' hang in this game till this game get my loot on
If I gotta kick mo' shit, let me put my fuckin boots on

Sick and tired of that bullshit

Quick to get your cheese on
Makin the g's with ease on
The streets, cause the gees on
The streets say they got love
But where in the fuck is that love at?
Fat sacks, packin gats, black, I would love that
But they ain't kickin out no lick, so to hell with it
Let me bail with it
And I'm straight before the ace show up
If I'm number 1, then I'm stuck
In this business fucked
I done paid my dues, so what up?

I've been on the road of my come-up since 1985
And I figured to get bigger, nigga gots to get live
I've strived to collect my dividends

A friend knew a friend knew a friend
I got an attitude, ain't no gratitude
About that shit you done did me with
Put no rubber on your dick, bitch
But I ain't even out to laid
I'm learnin to get paid
Layin my trademark down on the pave-

I'm makin hella tracks
But ain't no hella scratch
What the fuck's goin on, what the fuck's goin on?
When am I get my money on from kickin all these songs?
Yo, I'm fed up, and bout to head up to see the company

Andamos de parranda mi rey caile con la flota y flota
Andamos de parranda mi rey la noche es loca loca
Andamos de parranda mi rey caile con la flota y flota

Linda noche como para unas del davo en el coche
Huele a fiesta bien machin siento que hoy cerramos broche
Vengan por el desquite si la paso bien pata anoche
Que aquí hacemos que se moche hasta la mujer mas fantoshe

Ando en ayunas yo no dejo a las nenas sufriendo hambrunas
Que aquí hay pura morrita de clase así como tunas
No importa si fumas si tienes amigas traite alguna
Porque hoy traigo una actitud de no se me va a escapar ni una

Así que bailen, fumen tómense pónganse hacer lo que hagan
Pila hasta para el día siguiente de mis focos no se apagan
No faltan los compas mala copa que siempre la cagan
Pero los que no aguantan y se ponen pedos la pagan
Quime viera para nosostros no existe el hubiera
Soy el no se si era y me levanto ala hora que yo quiera
Igualito a las gorras que uso somos la nueva era
Y esta rola es para agarrar el cotorreo con mi bandera

Andamos de parranda mi rey la noche es loca loca
Andamos de parranda mi rey caile con la flota y flota
Andamos de parranda mi rey la noche es loca loca
Andamos de parranda mi rey caile con la flota y flota
Acércate como no como no como no yo también ando buscando algo
Más que un beso y como no como no como no aprovechame
Esta noche que mañana no regreso
Compás como andan volvieron los que música comandan
No queremos colados ni a los que de faroles andan

Tengo todo en regla mi vida es como andar de parranda
Y para no perder la costumbre haber chichis pa la banda
Por el compita que con una guama la fea ya es bonita
Con dos gusmas imita y con tres guamas hasta te invita
Pa' la cuarta al chile el compa hasta los calzones se quita
Quinta guama extraña a su ex novia llora y después vomita
Mano arriba la mamitas que hoy no trajeron candado
Viste si no ganchas nada es que andas bien salado
Y son embargo yo de aquí hasta que me amanezca
Me largo vaya sonrisa que me cargo pero mañana ahí te encargo

Solo una oportunidad se que juntos haremos la luz para esta oscuridad 

No es de electricidad es de felicidad y es que solo

Sé que hay más hombres detrás pero esto 
Que siento yo no lo había sentido jamás no sé si soñar 
Con las miradas que me das si no es que 
Exagere pero en verdad me muero si te vas

Yo no miento soy el cazador tu el mejor alimento 
Soy el príncipe del cuento y tu fuiste el mejor
Invento por ti los minutos cuento y me arriesgare 
En el intento y ahora siento una emoción de amor 
Al 200% si tú no quieres lo siento ya causaste 
Un sentimiento te juro por mi vida seré el hombre 
Más atento no me digas que no que ya ando nervioso
Y contento

Where it's good homeboy I thought you knew
So in the process to show the hood my best
No time to react caught 2 in the chest

Niggaz got beef 'cause Eiht Hype's a mack 

And since the age of thirteen, I've been packin

Droppin trunks of funk and I blast a punk from here to Cape Cod 

Fuck a job, my organization runs like the mob 

The original Joe Pex Flex, Redman bitch you better ask somebod 

Prepare to slam from here to Japan with jams 

I'm from the Jersey section and I keep it real for ninety-four and 

I can't march on swap meets, y'all duck sects I dissects 

But I pack a nine gat and the cops, still don't know where mines at

It's that funk deceased nigga comin through bitch so grab your hairpeace 

I got the gangsta in me plus I'm not friendly 

to a bitch-ass whose mouth runs more laps than the Indy 

Now let me spice the track up, MC Eiht pass the bone so I can get lifted 

And a head can get blown when Bronx pass the biscuit 

I drop the funk and drop a body to show I'm serious 

The gangsta means I'm live, rappin from New Jersey, period!! 



Chorus: 



Nuthin but the gangsta (8X) 



Verse Four: MC Eiht 



Hit the weights everyday like Popeye the sailor 

Bailin with my squashed up khakis and Chuck Taylors 

Just touched down from San Quentin 

Hand me that fresh ass Pendleton, uhh! 

It's nuthin but the gang, thing 

Makes me hit the corner and slang 

Board and quarter about a hundred times 

Don't be servin no dubs and dimes 

But I do it, no hesitation 

Fuck it, I'ma violate probation 

No one gave a mad fuck about me 

Since the age of eight I roamed the halls of LB 

Pops thrown out never had a big brother 

Put on the set when I could pick the right color 

The homey put me down on a half a bird 

Turned it into key now they bomb for me 

Rollin in the Trey on fuckin gold d's 

Nuthin but the motherfuckin gangsta in me, geyeah 



Outro: 



Nuthin but the gangsta- geyeah 

Nuthin but the gangsta- come down

That's how it's going down, uhh

Somebody snitchin ain't that a bitch
Motherfuckin 5-0 at my front door
Uhh , talkin about they got a gang of witnesses

Sellin dat candy is just the way to survive
And dealin them straps they won't take me alive
So now I gots ta play it like I say it
See the fuckin glare of the batch and I spray it
Uhh , they kickin my front door with them steel-toe boots
My face [?] so I starts to shoot

Grab the motherfuckin yea kick the backdoor fool , I'm out
All for your dollars and some sense

Uhh , I start to scatter like a mouse 
Snatch the fuckin yea and I'm out to my nigga Boom Bam's house

[VERSE 2 ]
I guess you can chalk up zero for the blue team
Look up in the sky and see the fuckin high beam
Tab on Boom Bam's window with the fuckin strap
Wake up my nigga One-Time's tryin to peel my cap
Special report just hit the fuckin airways
Be on the look-out for the nigga hair full of braids
They say i'm nuttin but a cheater
Trippin and I'm quick fast strapped with a Nine Millameter
Gotta make it to my motherfuckin nigga Chills
One-Times on they way and they want to kill
They lookin silly cause they got clowned
Heard the whisper chief williams 2 officers down
Uhh , here comes the motherfuckin tear gas
Bam dropped the mask and hit the side door kinda fast
One 5-0 that I killed 
Jumped on the motherfuckin metro to my nigga Chills

[VERSE 3 ]
Ain't no takin me to jail no bail no wonder
Kill 'em all cause the motherfuckin hood took me under
Uhh , One-Times won't give me no Juice
Heard the barkin , yes they let the dogs loose
Uhh , runnin like a motherfuckin strap with the mack
But i ain't that lucky
Caught one in the leg and in the damned back
Now bleedin like a stuck pig
But I keep bellin ""fuck you bitches"" is what I'm yellin
I make it to Chills and tell him he'd pack quick
Give me some ammo cause One-Time's is on my dick
Mellin cum cause Eiht ain't had enough
Bring them body bags , fool fuck they handcuffs
Ya'll goin down I thought I told ya
Caught one through the shoulder of my coat
So I bust 'em in the fuckin coap
The bullets flyin they tryna hit me , they might get me
But fuck 'em Imma take 2 with me

I'ma tell you 'bout the time that we first met
The story that you told was some fake bullshit
It was me and Chill my pal
The scene was like the showdown at the O.K. Coral
It was you and then about five of y'all hangin
Standin in the center lookin like y'all was bangin 
(Ain't nuthin but marks)
Approached me with your ""P"" hat
But I was high off the blunt, so I didn't see that
But I'm knowin I'm a nigga you love to hate
But you grab me by my shoulder and you conversate
I shouldn't've fell for it, I should've started slappin
Your eyes always dotted, you best stick to rappin
David Blake: you fake as fuck!
I mack your ass like a muthafuckin truck
I guess that eye was too black cause you still can't see me
Servin me a drink in your khaki bikini
Oh geah, just like I said before
Ain't nuthin but the ho on my dick
Little trick named Quik
Geah, quick to get fucked one time
You better be callin one-time before I pull out my nine
And nigga, checks this
Fill your Lexus full of holes as you slam into poles
Niggas should've just told me that you was a mark and 
I wouldn't've hit you up with that notorious park 
(You know where we from)
Can't fade it, better fear it
Got one of your little B.G.'s to write your fuckin lyrics
Playin around with the hood you get got
Nick name should be Spot for that eye you got
You and that fake muthafucka who wrote your rap
My nigga Boom Bam gon' slap with the trey-five strap
No muthafuckin truce
Get the ass cracked over the dome with the fuckin deuce-deuce
Don't make me have to act up
Cause you's a frail muthafucka with no back up
Original bangin on wax, nigga, you fake
'member One-Time Gaffled, nationwide blue tape
Original Compton representin to the T

And before we kill off, remember the 'niew did it to you
Slick talkin, fast walkin
Nigga, how'd you figure that the E wasn't gon' stand and deliver?
You ain't worth a penny

Park around the corner from the spot uh

So I bails up the block with that gangsta strut
Rememba the po po hot with my Cavi in my butt
Stepped on the porch gave my nigga some dap

Who's got paper?
But I shoot boxes
Plenty of cash to straight floss from the gate
You ain't seem grabs this green
Plenty of cream kingpins unsolved the scheme
I got my eyes on you
Geah, you want to ??? down from here to shoot
Got a crew
But you stand out
Miss thing wish I have X-rated vision to peep the G-strings
You know what I mean
Keeps the shit real live

Cheques in your coat and float to the arena
??? taps me on the shoulder, Tony have you seen her?
Let my Gators through the snappin'
Crystal sippin', drops along, geah baby what's happenin?
Hear me, see me
I could, uh, be your geenie, any wish comes true
Be my boo

Diamonds to chronic bud, oh yes indeed
Anything you want, anything you need

Independently hustlin' while you work in your stuff
Keep your condo pay so you work at MC Gruff
9 TO 5 paper chasing, geah, I can dig it 
With your 15 hundred dollar brims and your fixed up ???
No trips to the clinic
But it straight trips to the club
With your head hooked up, short skirts straight throwin' up love
Mr Tony know the game ain't playin' nice and soft
G's around ya in a circle talkin' about take that shit off
Damn niggas, swingin' on a players boss
Peeps tha Coup, hits me up with a fucked phone call
I be's the black desperado
Five carats with the golden ??
Gang of parrots, me and you
King and queen of the hill
Means the fat links, captain inch nail
Get down like you live and that's no joke
Gang of ???? to poke with the endo smoke

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Times is hard
And I can see you're a lil' rebellious
Now your homegirl kicks the rumours
In a way too jealous
Just can't stand to see ya
With a nigga with grip
They swallowin' too much dick tryin' to give you some lip
Not trip
It's too much gossip on the phone
Need to tell 'em ho's to find some dick on they own
What's wrong?
Same old song gettin' a boo
Drops your back on the block with no more packs to loot
Snatch back the dollar to diamonds
Necklace sales
Versace ?? to Armani dressers
No more sippin' Crystal anymo'
Drop a see-5 hun' with the phone
Leave me alone
Cause that's the problems nowadays
These greedy-ass ho's workin' these ways

MC Eiht,"Geah
My nigga Muggs in the house
Who keeps you humpin'
Eihthype keeps you thumpin'
Always into somethin'
Westside got it going on 
Westside got it going on

Who creeps in smooth with moves like Gotti
Trips to make grips and back to the party
Million dollar holler with the Jazzy Belles
97 makes moves with the freaky tales
Hold up, stop the presses
Floats to the club and show me love in little short dresses
From 8 at night till 6 in the morn'
Intend to get ?naked?, try to put me on
Tick tock, it don't stop, clock keeps tickin'
Pour one more and wait for the liquor to kick in
Lookin suspicious cause you don't know the game plan
To the V.I.P. you peeps the ?three span?
Naughty as I want to be, so check it
Drama to the women I perfected to get naked
2 shots of the V.S.O.P. Rémy
Converstions as I tugs on your bikini
Got to get it, cause I've never had
Takes the party back to my pad, color me bad
Oops... I swoops up in the Coupe
One more pussy to loop, I'm knockin the boots
Geah

Who got you humpin'
Eihthype's always bumpin'
Always into somethin' (geah)
Westside's got it goin' on

Number one desperado, packin the hollows
In a nice tight suit with Christy to swallow
Who's the role model, bitch butt-naked on the boat
'cross the lake, we skate with the heavy weights
Can you feel me? Surfs all night, be rich
500 super sport, low-low's hittin' the switch
Gots long dough, fo' sho', cops paid by the month
Weekly in the club, gots ho's to hunt
Gets mine, nose to the grind, makes cheese
Ain't never seen three niggas like these
Still gots the connects, pulls china white from Muggs
Rolex, more sex by the Compton thugs
Senoritas and peso's for the Amigos
Wherever the wind blows, you're sure to see those
Heavyweight hustlers that got the green
Chronic, snaps and bitches, the American Dream
Geah

Chorus...

Makes me want to throw my hands up and holler
It all seems like a dream
How we gettin the cream and still in Impalas, c'mon
If you gots the time, then I gots the time
Best not be that bitch dropped dime
Stops my money flow, where's my money, hoe?
Out the door, watch the pimp with the gangsta limp
Limo rides, westside, I keep it crackin
Thousand dollar suits while the Gators keep snappin
Bird flies in, top dollar bitches to stab
Sets up nice on Boom Bam ab
Makes me laugh sometimes... ha-ha
Fine bitches and money makes me do the cha cha
Ooh-lah-lah, 'cross the board money to spend
Open the door, bitch, get in

Chorus...

My nigga Muggs one time, c'mon
Geah
Ya know how we do, ya know how we do
Come on, get down like you live, get down like you live

Watch my back, always packs the automatic

Yo would you kill for me?

Hmmm... yeah

What took you so long to answer motherfucker?

I don't know

The fuck wrong with you bitch?

When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's dick (yeah)
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife (uh, yeah)
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Come into the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little (yeah)
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch (uhh)
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right

Just me and my bitch

But you know you love that ass, don't you?

Yeah, no question

No question

Yo, let me ask you another question

What?

You ever fuck around on me?

Why would I do that?

Yo don't lie to me motherfucker

Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh no, that's not my steelo
I wanna bitch that like to play celo, and craps
Packin gats, in a Coach bag steamin dime bags
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had (yeah, c'mon)
With a glock just as strong as me
Totin guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet (that's nasty)
Throwin my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fuckin die together

Just me and my bitch

Let me tell you nigga, if I ever, ever catch your ass fuckin around
I'ma cut your mother-fuckin dick off

Hah, heheh stop playin, hah

I ain't playin, ain't no jokes, ain't no jokes
Ain't no jokes

Yo, don't don't play with my dick

She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger (yeah)
One day, she put nine one one on the page
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major (yeah)
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggaz felt they had to kill the closest one to me 
(uh, yeah)
And when I find em your life is to and end
They killed my best friend... me and my bitch

Just me and my bitch

Uh, yeah, yeah
Uh...
Uh, motherfucker yeah

[b-real]
I put years in this shit struggled to build the empire
Just another brick in the wall you fall tired
Who will be the one son to fall victim?
Who's on the street, who's runnin' from pigs wishing?
No way out
You can't stay out - your hook
Criminal lifestyle, you're booked in the crook
Where will you seek shelter? killafornia
What'll you do when you see the heat around the corner?
You silly fucking goner, where will you hide?
On the sick side of town facin' the long ride
Sick-ass soul assassins I keep blastin'
Cause you never know when it's time for some action
A fraction, chain reaction the crew smashin'
Through your city get the committee a ready faction
We run shit
And muthafuckas are on it
You can't call it, buster you better stall it

[chorus]
We got g-boys and ho's on deck
One times gafflin' niggas that chin check (check it out)
You see a robbery
We done it
That's just the way we run it

[eiht]
Ten years in the game, no chains remain
Heavy weights, get it straight, still bringin' the pain
First green since the b.g.
I gotta get cream
Late night hype's the fiends as I plots a scheme
Got tight with rap flows and followed the rap shows
But the streets keep callin' me to cluck the pesos
Did good
I made up tapes about the hood
Locked down that shit as nobody could
Enemies always out to get me
But just keep spittin' rhymes and they won't hit me
Street dreams always made of this
Top dollar
Bitches and switches is on my list
Leave your ass with the good night kiss
Makes moves smooth so your shorty won't miss
Never runnin' to meal, we chill on the hill
Real g's always packs the steel

[chorus]

[eiht]
It ain't a problem that I can't fix
Cause I can do it - in the mix
Nowadays
We be's the g's that's deadly
Bustin' raps, shootin' craps, gots the straps on ready
Common sense'll tell you, slide out
But ain't no fuckin' where for you to hide out
Got the picture?
We don't play no games
Eiht and be-real fuckin' frank & jesse james
To the limit
Watch us do what we do
Leave your whole life fucked turn misty blue
Senoritas and pesos yes yes y'all
Ball cause we to tall and never fall
We got paper fo' sho'
No doubt
Criminal mind this time you're assed out
Define it
Here's your strollin' paper just sign it
Take a walk as the eiht starts to talk

Code of the streets you pack heat and skeet
Any fuckin' hoodrat bitch you can meet
Poor muthafuckas still wating - on the county
Young black niggas dodgin' the county mountie
Who got the fat stacks, the pack stacks
Slugs to your back if my clientele you jack
Knick knack - patty wack, packs straps 
Patty-wack your own homie trying to cheat on craps

From yo hood 2 my hood's all the same
Like yo hood and mine learn the same games
Thug niggas, strapped girls down on planes
If you get caught then don't say no names

I gotta flick from a homie doing ten in the pen
Gotta a little bigger since my lil' nigga went in
Lotta tales 'bout fools gettin' em up and shanked
Whose mouth tight shut? Whose shit that stink?
Gotta lil' message - 'bout the bitch you fucked
A nigga cross town got the hoodrat stuck
Me and Loc jacked that nigga last week fo' ends
I shoot a lil' paper till you up in the pen
Fools still riding - got the spot on lock
We gon' chill right here till you back on the block
Nigga still bailin round here khakis and stars
High as fuck as we throw the hood out the car
We miss the days when you used to get drunk at night
Never bailed on a homie when it's time to fight
One times jacked us the last night, face in the dirt
Tryin' to get info on who shot the store clerk

From yo hood 2 my hood's all the same
Like yo hood and mine learn the same games
Thug niggas, strapped girls down on planes
If you get caught then don't say no names

Somebody help me out the ghetto
Ya know - same story just like before
I don't want to be here just like you
I slangs just 'bout everything to start new
Do you have the answer? 
Niggas gettin' popped - dying off just like cancer
You got your enemies, you got your old G's
In the penitentiaries just want to be free
If I had another chance would I do it again?
Rewind the time and head right back to the pen
Seems like I can't escaped this world of sin
Judgement for this young thug in the end
Time's up - this thug caught a slug
In another town trying to slang drugs
My moms pray for my soul
As I lay below
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto

Chorus...

Geah
You how we do it",From Yo Hood 2 My Hood
MC Eiht,"[EIHT]
We sending this one out right here
To all the young thug and young hustlers out there
You know I'm sayin', grown up with their moms strugglin'
In the hood yo' I'm sayin', ya know how it is
Trying to keep it tight, you know I'm sayin' 
Geah

Born and raised a black youth, no happy days
My moms and pops went they separate ways
Now she solo with half the dough, and three kids
No house, a damn tight situation we in

Hit the streets to look for work and pay
So her kids can have it better than she had one day
Try to teach me some rules, ""Get A's in school
Keep your head up high and don't run with the fools""

That was the lesson, always listen to moms
Bible she totin, always quotin from Psalms
Young but I'm knowin' the right thang to do 
Know the things to say when times is blue

Times is hard and really unfortunate
I'm young and I really don't like the shit
But I dream nice things when I sleep at night
When I grow up I'll make everything alright
Sing

[SOULTRE]
I know it's hard sometimes
But if you can make a way, you need to hold up
I know a better way
And if you can wait today it'll be alright...

[EIHT]
Now I'm 15, my life done hit a split screen
What used to be a good kid struck a bad gene
Bad dreams, young thugs and crime scenes
Skip school, saggin' my jeans and blow green

My moms don't know where I get the shit from
If you keep trippin' you know the outcome
Laid up somewhere, or in jail
Makin' collect calls tryin' to make bail

Hell, and you know how I struggle for the cheddar
Before I give it away better get it together
My guilty conscience sayin' not no listen
The other have tellin' me, keep a good intention

Aw shit, a nigga need a mind of his own
Too much to deal with, I really don't feel shit
Young thug ready to take on the world
Who made my life take such a twirl
Come on

[Chorus]
Now my situation's changed, no chains remain
Now I try to check out the game and cause pain
Long live the days of homeboys and straps
Gang of tombstones for the ones that caught caps

Make snaps off raps, reminiscin' of days
Good part is shot up while 'More Bounce' plays
Missin the days sometimes, but keeps my eyes on the future
Keep my hands on my heat cause niggas might shoot ya

Rob a nigga blind, just like Stevie
I used to do the same when a nigga was greedy
But my come-up was wrong, flipped it, now it's strong
Now I clocks snaps, keep the street shit in my songs

Trying to make it up on a stage from doin' a bid
Trying to make a better way like she did for my kids
Right now watch out, keep my nose to the grind
Yeah boy, this world is mine
Geah

[Chorus]",Hold Up
MC Eiht,"Geah

Geah
You like the way I get down like y'all live
Check it out

y'all know the
Bitch I need, nuthin but cash and weed
Out of town trips, slips my cash with speed
Don't get it twisted, no Captain
But I'm cappin' and duckin'
While a hoe hides me out and I'm steadily fuckin'
Doin your thang
While I teach you how to hop on planes
Get this cream from this fool with the country name
Same day you get back, my bankroll stack
As a matter of fact, you know I like that
Sticky bitches have niggas straight spendin' they dough
Ya know cash runs everything around a hoe
Greedy as fuck, a chicken tryin' to scheme on chickens
Greedy as fuck, to pay the bitch, she keep on lickin'
I love the hoe
She's out to get my paper fo' sho'
Anytime and place she ready to go
Love scratch
No pigeon in the world could match
Simple as fuck
Hood rats ain't hard to catch
Geah

Hood rats
We lovin 'em ho's, we lovin 'em ho's

Sing with me...

Sneaky cause she want to just fuck for ends
Fuck and spend, fuck, run tell yo' friens
All of y'all do their fuckin' shit
All your homegirl, bitch, who you fuckin' with
Gossip you spit
Put each other up on game
On which nigga's got chips, routine's the same
Shakin' that ass with the jiggle and twitch
In the club bustin', knowin I'ma want that bitch
You ain't seein a nigga ghetto rich
Ghetto fab, ghetto star
Hop off stage, ???bless thou??
No questions asked, that's the role you play
You hit me up on Monday
Fuck the bitch anyway
It ain't nuthin'
And leave suckas say: the bitch good for somethin
Anywhere, any day, any hour
In front of anybody, in the shower
Geah   

Hood rats
I'm lovin 'em ho's, I'm lovin 'em ho's
Geah ya know how it goes...
Hood rats...
Geah, check me out

Is she or she not the top notch?
Watch the peddle pushers and rocks in a ?????
How she cop, bitch flips, trips, no sleepin
Back to the club where she strips on a weekend
You know what I'm speakin' she's out to get yo' bread
???? up, choke up, showin some leg
Get down like you live and get down on a dime 
You bring yo' homegirl, that's fine
Who is better?
I got the chedder ready to spend
With a video tape so I can record the date
Fuckin' with Eiht it's all good
Now back that ass up like you know you should
Know the game alive, toss chips
Watch you get down and start movin' the crowd

Some of that futuristic shit
For that ass
Keepin it thuggish, though
Check it out

[ VERSE 1 ]
The concrete streets bring heat, it's so rough
Niggas test everyday, calling your bluff
Eiht had enough, I'm smoking my fluff
Spitting game, letting you know my turf is tough
My theme is I push music to driveby
I slide through, scoop up four and ride high
Strap under the seat my hood technique
As I destroy your block like _Dante's Peak_
Feel me, partly a killer, clocker for fun
On my turf puttin in work since day one
y'all ain't heard enough about a nigga singin the blues
Niggas bendin in two's while y'all watch the news
John Walsh, wash me up, you're crazy
Havin my face captured 180
Can't go there, ain't havin that, man, fuck
The strap turned me corrupt, so prepare to duck

[ CHORUS ]
Sometimes in the hood it's so rough
That makes niggas from the hood stay tough
Slings packs, pack straps, quarters and halfs
16, double the stash, you do the math		(2x)

[ VERSE 2 ]
I guess my mind's on the track, gotta get me a stack
And in fact, homebody, you know what gun I pack
Keeps y'all enemies close that stay cheatin
When they ask make fast and start heatin
Niggas ain't fuckin around - dodge mine
Drop yours, bitch, and lay that ass down
Keep your face to the ground, don't even look
No positive ID and all the money was took
Shook the hell up out the spot and kept away from snitches
Took a trip across town just to floss my riches
Bitches turn into niggas and start yappin
One more hit on your house where y'all nappin
Dumpin one, catch you in the midnight, the late night hour
The hollow point shower
The sweet success thatt you taste has got sour
Straight, Eiht regulate my thug power

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
My niggas disappoint me thinkin y'all can fade it
Still player-hated, wishin y'all made it
Stay down, Hoo-Bangin niggas takin over
G's in lows puttin holes up in a Rover
Told ya, stop tryin to walk in our shoes
Real thugs hail from the west, first rule
In fact, we the first Bloods and Crips
First niggas to drive by sendin tricks on trips
First niggas to hit yo town and set up shop
Bring the prices down low, y'all pick the rest to cop
Copy cats, now y'all dippin lows with heats
Pepetratin Fresh Coast, tryin to roll our streets
Hate your sight, catch you on a red-eye flight
Commence the sweatin the groove just for spite
Lucky though, I give you a pass and let you go
I'ma catch you on the road at another rap show

Feel a little gust of wind so I jet
This real nigga dwells from Compton, no shit
Thugs town, right now car jacks and sales
County bus rolls through - niggas trips to jail
What the hell won't trade it, high class can't fade it
Out of town trips with pigeons is how we made it
why'all niggas hate to get a dubs and rocks
Land of the green weed and cars that ???? hops
Don't stop - packin' my heat and Beretta 
Guarantee my hollows goes tough through your leather 
Whenever the rhyme play or the 9 play (ping ping!)
It's a done deal when I hit you run way

But I'm kinda fast when they spit the 9 triggers 
Till my dying day I lay away
Till my very last breath, nigga, I swear to make you pay
Guilty conscience? Never me!
Last night nigga done caught a felony
Jealousy try to approach, want to promote
Then provoke through gun smoke, watch out, loc!
Shake down cause these niggas fuckin' with yours
Get in where you fit in even if it's a back door 
Or the window, tie up the ho', where's the scope?
Trying to hand me you popped, you're booked, I want more
Lock down for me on the bus downtown

We be kickin' in do's, sweevin' 4-4's
Shovin' 30 clips in a fully Mack 1-0's
So as the clock tickin' - and the plot thickens
We be juggin' up Sherman - and rockin' up chicken
(What you need, nigga?)
Time to elevate the game and turn it up a notch
And bust on the muthafuckin' neighborhood watch
My money greener than a clover - in a 4-6 Rover
I be a millionaire thuggin until it's all over
I take a ice cold 40 of Cristal and what they servin'
Me and a Persian hoe in a 6-4 blowin' doja while we swervin'
Keep that off the hood, greed and determination in my eye, nigga
Be my piece of the pie, nigga, so I ride until I die,nigga

MC Frontalot,"Oh man, I try to dodge fans but they keep swarming.
Mc frontalot's heart's huge; let's have a housewarming.
I love you so damn much I'll sell ya CDs.
I'm greedy to get loved back like ally sheedy

In wargames. I got more sayings and turns of phrase
In my communist handbook than in my -- damn, what'd
I do with my ledger? I'll never get paid now!
That distributor promised me checks but didn't say how

He was gonna locate the Front.
It's the anonymity I'm a little bitty bit late to shun.
Hate to run; can't be tardy to my rally:
""Art Must Be Free"" is the decree. The finale

Is my lecture on the evils of the R-I-double-A,
How they gonna sue you every single time you hit play.
They're lame! must revolt! what's that you say?
Kids are pirating the frontalot? oh no, I got betrayed!

It's true
Frontalot's destitute
I need you
To buy my CD so I could buy food

I been a charity case to my fan base for years:
In tears at my show, ""somebody buy me ride home.""
Now I got something I can barter for services.
Yo don't let the major labels get word of this.

I'm girderless, free falling towards riches;
Gonna sell so many CDs that I can afford britches
And a shirt, AND a hat to go with it.
I get specific -- 'cause my fantasy is that vivid.

I'm gonna buy gadgets that don't do anything but beep
And blink, then I'll go out in public & buy drinks --
But it's contingent on your ponying up.
Wait, you got my record on bittorrent? fuck!

Might seem like there's no DRM but I'll explode
Your computer like COBRA done to GI Joe
On the episode about computer viruses.
Oh look, there's the ledger: overflowing with minuses.

My spinelessness in the face of the starvation
Projected by my cashflow erodes the hesitation
I once harbored as regards the tune vending.
If only the nerd kids' aversion to spending

Money on data got inverted somehow
I'd be making my way through all my dollars with a plow
But instead I'm down on ground on my knees
Begging y'all to believe my CD isn't free.",Charity Case

E a menina que sonha em ser uma atriz de novela

A rua é nossa e eu sempre fui dela
Desde descalço gastando canela
Hoje no asfalto de toda São Paulo
De nave do ano, tô na passarela

No samba, no rap e tambor
Erga as mãos pro céu igual meu redentor

Time and time and time and time and time again
I kept on knocking but these people wouldn't let me in
I tried and tried and tried and tried to make a way
But nothing happened till that day that I prayed

That's word, we pray, pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We got to pray just to make it today
I said, ""We pray"", pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We got to pray just to make it today, that's word, we pray

Children dying, oh so fast from this or that
Need that money, bookin' that dope, smokin' that crack
Ten years old, stand outside, better looked out
Dead and gone, never had a chance, what's it all about?

That's word, we pray, pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We need to pray just to make it today
I said, ""We pray"", pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We need to pray just to make it today that's word, we pray

We need to pray just to make it today
I said, ""We pray"", pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We need to pray just to make it today, that's word, we pray

All our missions start to doubt, here we go
Kicking back, read these words, we need to know
Living high, living good, living long
Take a minute, bust a prayer and you're good to go

That's word, we pray, pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We need to pray just to make it today
I said, ""We pray"", pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We need to pray just to make it today, that's word, we pray

We're sending this one out to the Lord and we thank you
And we know, we need to pray, 'cause all the blessings
That are good they come from above and once again we want
To say, ""Thank you"" to the Lord with all our love, we are here

That's word, we pray, pray, pray, pray, pray

Make em shiver, Q-tip couldn't flow if he was a river
And me, I'm sellin milli like runnin the mill
And like Big Daddy Kane ""I Wonder How You Gotta Record Deal""
Well everyday too make hits, you ain't got it
Til this day you never ? never had it
For me I tend to kick it like a partner
And must I remind you I'm the funky headhunter

I come on your block and move you out like a you-Haul
So step right up and be the next contestant
A Tribe Called Quest Is A Bad Investment
I'm breakin em off with somethin proper!

Chorus (4x)

So pick the time and the place if you ever wanna Warren G

It's the one you can't touch, pump it up, turn it up
A brand new cut for the Hammer to burn up
Suckers gettin' mad 'cause over 20 million sold
And now they try to diss 'cause they can't get gold

I was born in a hole, now I'm in control
(Yo, yo)
Bank boy deep is the way we roll
(We roll)
I'm mackin' for the punks
Talkin' the junk on the tracks

The hammer don't hurt 'em days are over
These are the days of the payback, payback
I'm up on the hill lookin' down
Biggidy phat rap track number one pound for pound, punks

Yeah, you runners, beware of Hammer

If ya got something on ya chest, let it off
'Cause we can get it on, don't let the dance steps fool ya
'Cause if I catch ya slippin', I'ma have to do ya, do ya

One to the chin, another to the jaw
I know ya just bustas perpetrating like ya raw
Mash it, Trash it, search couldn't pass it

Some claiming towns that they ain't even from
Some claiming they hard, but never shot a gun, Bustas

Bust 'em in the back, bust 'em, bust 'em, bust 'em in the back
And watch those suckas play dead

Straight from high street, raised by the o.g.'s
Never slanged keys, but quick to drop them be's
Put 'em in the trunk and that ain't no front
'Cause east oak town didn't raise no punk

So sit up, get up, girls they get lit up
Check it, Hammer came with the unexpected, I wrecked it
Quik, I gets mad wicked, I didn't check the rhyme
'Cause Q-Tip couldn't kick it

And that punk Redman, I hit you with the back son
Talk is cheap, it's time time for some action
Gonna make you eat every word that you said
And a trick like you would end up dead, Red

But another talk about the moms and the pops
And when the joking stops, I'ma knock off ya block
And watch ya body drop the ya album straight flopped, Fool, Fool

I can't call it but I know I got started
'Cause my mama was broke and I was broken hearted
I can take tears and tears for years
But the tears of my mama yo, they get me right here

So I broke out in a military step, no deally, no dally
I walked, I crept, I slept on a plan that I'd make it all good
A young preacher if you could
A young hustler from the hood

Mama, don't you cry, don't you cry no more
Ya baby boy's blowin' up and he's goin' to war
My mind is playin' tricks and my dad is too
High street bank boys, it's on, fools

Rollin' 5 deep and on fools we creep
Half the town is down and you can't see me, really dough

What's next? A young fool on a flex
Tryin' to get a name, some props or rep
I stepped right to him let 'em know it's all good
Lights out, now his crib is wood

Broke for the dough but now I can't see
It's blood on my hands my dog, yo, G?'
I hit the flo' but my heart didn't stop
And now I see a vision of my son wit no pop

My mama's on her knees
Lord, Lord no please
And I feel cold and my health is cheatin'
It's gettin' dark but yet and still

I'm half dead, half life, what's real?
I can't breathe but now I'm startin' to choke
Off my own blood and not that indo smoke
No joke, straight up, on a serious tip

I'm losin' my life, I'm losin' my grip, I slip, s-s-slip deeper still
Help Lord, help Lord, I'm losin' my will
To live, low, stuck at the bottom
From winter to spring to summer to autumn

Help Lord, the homies in the hood
The squares, the G's, it's all good
Help Lord 'cause in the hood we sprung
And we stuck right here until you come

And bless the children of the ghetto life
No love, no hope, no hope, no life

MC Hammer,"Pass me not, oh, gentle Savior
Hear my humble cry
While the others Thou are calling
Do not pass me by

I've got the feelin' and the feelin's not the same
I did the hip hop, a little Hammer and the James
But a touch, a touch from up above
And I get the feelin', the feelin' of Your love

Reachin' out, callin' for Your people
(Reachin' out)
To keep us all safe from a world that's full of evil
Tryin', cryin', Lord, sometimes I'm cryin
When I think of His gifts and the world just keeps denying

When I think of His goodness
And what He's done for me
My soul cries, Hallelujah
Thanks for savin' me, sing

Savior, Savior, why don't You
Hear my humble cry
While the others Thou are calling
Do not pass me by
(Dance break?)

I don't want the Lord to pass me by
I don't want the Lord to pass me by
I don't want the Lord to pass me by
I don't want the Lord to pass me by
I don't want the Lord to pass me by
I don't want the Lord to pass me by
I don't want the Lord to pass me by

I, I need Him at home
At work, at school
Do you need Him?
I know you need Him

While the others Thou are calling
Do not pass me by
Do not pass me by

MC Hammer,"[Chorus 2x]
Let's get it started!

[Verse 1]
Now your party wasn't jumping and your DJ was weak
Instead of dope beats, he was spinnin them Z's
All the fly girls who came with a beat in mind
They all up against the wall like a welfare line
Do you think for one minute that this is it?
Your party is bogus, Yo it ain't legit
You better put on the hammer, And you will be rewarded
My beat is ever boomin, And you know I get it started
Get it started!

[Chorus 5x]

[Verse 2]
Now get up out your seat because my beat is so complete
I'm movin everybody from A to Z
And when it comes to straight up rockin, I'm second to none
From Doug E. Fresh to LL or DJ Run
They say hammer how you do it? I got it like that
My posse's ever rollin, We keep it in tact
Just put on the hammer, And you will be rewarded
My beat is ever boomin, And you know I get it started

[Chorus 6x]

[Verse 3]
Now, a lot of be	-boys make em dance, Yo they fakin the beat
They hip hop on the outside put rock underneath
Before the show gets started, They shakin they boots
My posse in the end cold displayin the troops
Like a trooper, I'm down cold hooked on the drugs
808 SB12'S are expirin africans
Just put on the hammer, And you will be rewarded
My beat is ever boomin, And you know I get it started

[Chorus 5x]

[Verse 4]
They said it couldn't happen, that rap wouldn't last
The beat is in effect like the oil in your gas
Cause it's makin lots of money from top to bottom
Whatever in effect, Yo, be	-boys have got em
Nobody knows how a rapper really feels
A mind full of rhymes, and a tongue of steel
Just put on the hammer, and you will be rewarded
My beat is ever boomin, and you know I get it started
