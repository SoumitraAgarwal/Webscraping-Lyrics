Shifty,"CHORUS:
I can't believe I'm fallin' so hard for you
we've known eachother so long
all along i've been out lookin' for somethin'
when somethin' was you all along

I used to look to you as a friend
the one I'd call when i felt like my life was 'bout to end
when the sky is fallin' down and the walls are closing in
inside i need a friend so i'm callin' you again
oh can ya lift me up because i feel so down
I'm lost in my head i feel used but refuse to believe that love is dead
cause you gave me all the signs but i was blind
my third eye sees you now
i keep lookin' up and leavin' believin' this one's right
but that one just ain't my type or height
see I'm not tryin' to waste my life or sit back and watch as
it races by cause what I'm lookin' for is a love that's true
i never thought it was you and i don't know why
i always thought it was her that I'd find her for sure
but I'm a little too old to be actin' immature

CHORUS

your the one that loves me and your the one that cares
and girl your the one that will always be there
se i've looked high and i've looked low
for the girl that i had right under my nose
and goes to show you really never know
so i turned around and found my way back to your front door
and i don't think we can be just friends anymore
I'm here to let you know i let the other girls go
i hope you feel like i feel cause i swear that somethin's real
and its tearin' me apart now I'm an owner of a lonely heart
so if i wish upon a star we could live a fairy tale
I'm not afraid to try and I'm not afraid to fail
i made up my mind this time you took the scale
now let my lips touch your lips keep it down girl 
cause i wouldn't want you to miss this for the world

my third eye sees you now

(music...)

girl you can keep me in a stay 
girl you just take my breath away
your more than just a friend to me
so you can have your way (your way your way)

lets say that we were meant to be
if we don't try we'll never see
believe and take a chance with me
so you can have your way (your way your way)

CHORUS",All Along
Shifty,"I wish we could live forever
But everyone dies
Everyone laughs 
And everyone cries

I'll be mad but I'm glad
You were part of my life
Make sure you stop by my dreams
When I'm sleepin' at night

Now a piece of my heart 
Is lookin' down from the sky
Like an angel on my shoulder
Helpin' me to get by

And all the words that you told me 
Were the words of the wise
To navigate my path 
Through the drama and lies

[Chorus]
I won't forget you
And I'll keep on loving you
Buts its hard to live my life
When you are not around
I'll try and make it through
I know you want me to
But its hard to think of you
Without me breakin' down
I know your in a better place
I know you finally feel the pain
I miss you my best friend
I'll never find someone like you again

I try to stay optimistic 
But it hurts so bad
For me to lose the best friend
That I probably ever had

Now every day that I wake
I see how precious life is
Maybe someday you'll come back
As one of my kids

It's crazy things change
How hard life can be
I remember we were young
Everything seemed so easy

I had you by my side 
And I thought you'd never leave me
And even though your gone
You still never will believe me

[Chorus]

Were born to live
And we live to die
Walk on the ground
And soar through the sky

And were born to live
And we don't ask why
Transcend and reside
When stone angels cry

Were born to live
And we live to die
Walk on the ground
And soar through the sky

And were born to live
And we don't ask why
Transcend and reside
When stone angels cry

[Chorus]

(Were born to live and we live to die)
I know your in a better place
(Were born to live and we don't ask why)
I know you finally feel the pain
(Were born to live and we live to die)
I miss you my best friend
(Were born to live and we don't ask why)
I'll never find someone like you again",A Better Place
Shifty,"Lovin' you
Is easy cause your beautiful
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Come on
Now girl your beautiful
So beautiful
It tears me up like what

No matter how
How much I get it 
Never seems to be enough

We've had our
Ups and downs
Our highs and lows
And everytime we fight it's like more of the juice exposed

But you know
That's just they way love goes
If I wasn't passionate about it
Baby then I wouldn't explode

Oh, oh temper temper
Well here we go again
Cause I'm your lover, your protector
And your very best friend

There ain't a doubt in my mind
That we were meant to be
Baby girl your so fine
Feel my frequency

I want you next to me
For the rest of my life
I'm singin' no more lonely nights
Like Bob Marley

Everything is gonna be alright
Said I want you by my side
'Til the day that I die
We can drink get high

We can dance all night
Under the moonlight
Tongue and cheek 
I got you freakin' on me

Baby please

Now when the sky is fallin' down
Girl I found that your the cure
'Cause your the only thing that's real
When I'm feelin' insecure

You're always there for me
When I need someone to care for me
Apparently you made the right move
Rather carefully

So till the end I'm lovin' you
Kissin' you and huggin' you
Even though your friends have got
A different point of view

And after everything 
That we've been through 
It's really easy lovin' you
It's true

My heart has got 
The scars to prove
I'm obsessed with you
And everything you do

Its magical 
It brings me close to you
Close is true
I don't know what you do

And I remember when we started
Everything was so real
And there's no words to express 
The way you make me feel

And lovin' you ain't hard
It's easy 'cause your beautiful
And who knows what's comin' next
Our sex is like a ritual

Ooh child
Baby girl you got a place in my heart
You either hold my life together 
Or you break it apart

You really got a hold on me
Don't you ever let go
Don't you let me be
'Til I tell you so

You're on my mind all the time
You're so controllable
'Cause you oh so fine
And I'm claiming you as mine

Woah-oh hey no
How low will I go
How high can I get
I've lost all control

Woah-oh hey no
How far will we go
You got a hold on my soul
Don't you ever let go

Loving you 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh",Ez Cuz You're Beautiful
Shifty,"Oh Lolita
Girl ya make it so hot
It's likes I got a fever
Oh Lolita
I think I need ya now
I could tickle your pink
If ya let me get down

I see a dancer by the jukebox, drinking sangria
Down in Mexico where the carbo cantina
I said ""hey senorita come an dance with me""
If ya haven't got a man that's what I plan to be
Now move a little closer
Put your hands on my body
I'm trapped in the moment, I can hardly breathe
A combination of you plus some melody
Got me feeling like tonight might be meant to be

She looked at me, like I looked at her
Then she licked my lips, I said ""it's on for sure""
Now baby don't stop, I'm feeling you
can't put my finger on one thing
Its everything you do
I say we have a drink or two
Just to set the mood
An head down to the beach on a rendezvous
We can dance on the stars
Swing from the moon
From Cabo San Lucas all the way to Cancun

Oh Lolita
Girl ya make it so hot
It's likes I got a fever
Oh Lolita
I think I need ya now
I could tickle your pink
If ya let me get down

First I think its over
Then she does it again
She makes me feel so good
I don't want it to end
An I can't pretend I don't feel the way I do
My eyes used to wander
Now I've only eyes for you
Your a breath of fresh air
A dream come true
I might have come with my friends
But I'm leaving with you
Ain't a doubt in my mind
Its about that time
We head back to my room
An begin to unwind
I can take off your clothes
You can take off mine
I'll stand and deliver
Sending shivers up your spine
There's no need to rush
We can kiss an touch
Rock around the clock
Yeh baby don't stop
Cause you make it so hot
Your mind likes a ???? and loves all I got
Is all we got
Is all we need
So you just come with me an see
I could blow your mind or my pretty baby

Oh Lolita
Girl ya make it so hot
It's likes I got a fever
Oh Lolita
I think I need ya now

We're moving so fast
We can't take it slow
Oh Lolita
I can blow your mind
Why don't you come with me
We could spend some time
Oh Lolita

I want to show you how fun life can be
I want to show you all the things you've never seen
Grab a hold of my body
Spend the night with me

Shifty,"She's magical, magical
The girl's got a spell on me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
She's magical, magical
A modern day wizardry
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Now she's a heart stopper
Jaw dropper for real
Baby steals my breath 
With her sex appeal

She's everything I ever wanted
And more
She makes me feel like a kid
In the candy store

And like a rabbit out a hat
She's a disappearing act
I wink inside the mirror
And she always winks back

I'm in room thirty-two
You can come up and see me
I'll make your bikini disappear 
Like Houdini

It's our time 
No time's better than now
You can bite me, scratch me
And throw me around

You might be the prettiest thing
I ever saw
Lookin' like that should be 
Against the law

She's just my taste
Got a face to match
I said this is one girl
That I got to catch

You might be the one 
Who can set me free
So lets work it out
Work your magic on me

[Chorus]
She's magical, magical,
The girl's got a spell on me
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
She's magical, magical
A modern day wizardry,
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Sexy girl you got a spell on me
You got me runnin' up the street
Like a dog in heat

Your such an inspiration
You got my heart racin'
Got me levitaded
With your sex education

Tell me is it real or just 
My imagination
Are you lookin' for love
Well I'm over here waitin'

Baby I'm the real
Can you feel the chemistry
No smoke and mirrors
I believe what I see

I believe in you
Now can you believe in me
I feel the energy 
You want to be my fantasy

Hey pretty girl 
Come and give me a kiss
It ain't hard to do 
It's as easy as this

Put your lips to my lips 
Put your hands on my side
Move your body closer
And look into my eyes

I got a heart made of gold
And a bottle full of brew
The only thing I'm missin'
Is you

[Chorus]

Say yeah, oh yeah, 
And say yeah, oh oh oh yeah
Oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Magical, magical 
So magical, magical
Magical, magical
So magical, magical",Magical
Shifty,"Shorty Rock, 
Ah, shorty rock don't stop
Oh Baby won't you take me back
Shorty rock
Ah, shorty rock don't stop
What's it gonna take for you to take me back

Now even though you're gone I still hear your voice my head
And all the sexy things you say when we're laying in bed
Remember you said you'd always be my ride or die girl
Remember my life changed when you came in my world
Bought you so much ice it would give you a brain freeze
I don't want the other girls, you're the one for me
And I can't picture my life without you in it
'cause our love had no bounds and it knew no limits
No gimmicks, it was straight thug passion
I miss afternoon back shots and that late night smashing
Whenever you want it you can have it
I made you my bad habit and gave you more cabbage than a rabbit

Our life together wasn't perfect
We'd argue but when we made up it was all worth it
Why'd you leave me, I just don't get it
Give me one more chance
I promise baby girl you won't regret it

[Chorus]
And girl I know I made you cry
But still I wonder why you're gone
And can you give me one more try
'cause without you I can't go on
Senorita

I know you hated it when I was grinding out on tour
That's why I left you with my heart, came back with Christian Dior
But your love didn't cost a thing
Not one red cent
Now I guess I know what J. Lo meant
And I have to admit that you made me a better man
I could love you forever
You were down for whatever and
When you left me it was hard to believe
Feeling like Maroon 5 without ya girl its harder to breath
I thought we'd make it through the coldest weather
We was supposed to grow old together
Man I should've known better
A mistake like that was fatal
That's what I get for being unfaithful 'cause you turned the tables
I know there's plenty stars in the sky and fish in the sea
I know I'm missing you, I hope you feel the same about me
So I apologize and admit I was wrong
Things just haven't been the same since you been gone

[Chorus]

And every night I'm seeing visions of you
Its difficult to try to live without you
But I'm movin on, word is born
Shorty rock I'm steady thinking of you
Its hard to live without you
Shorty rock sometimes its hard to make it through",Shorty Rock
Shifty,"One love
One shot

This is it love
It's what dreams are made of
But it is still up to us to feel the rush
To pursue things only gods can touch
And when we beat the odds royal flush
To fall

I gave my all but it wasn't enough
I'm never givin' up
I found life so if you gotta live it up
And life is to short for war
What can I say to show there's more
With people slamin' door in my face
And what for
That ain't the way the game plays
By making The same mistake day after day
I gotta a sly fun get away
A smile on my face;
Its a sunny day;
Girls, drinks and more drinks

Come to think
For such a big place
Its a small world
For such a rap race
I still got faith
And anything goes
Still I got to say life has its ups and downs
But I love it anyway

Shifty,"[Chorus] 
Everything I do, I do for you, 
And I could never live my life without, 
And late at night when I dream about you, 
I've heard of special, nothin special like you, 
And everything I do, I do for you, 
And I could never live my life without, 
And late at night when I dream about you, 
I've heard of special, nothin' special like you, 

I see ya everywhere I go, and you're uncomparable, 
To any of these other pretty girls I know, 
And when you walk into the room, girl you steal the show, 
You try to act like you're normal but you're finer than you know, cause, 
Everyone looks when you cross a room, 
One look and I was hooked like be real to boom, 
Cause you play hard to get, which I really respect, 
Lipstick like a red corvette, with intellect, 
Gimme the time, any time, I'm sure we'll connect, 
I'm sure we'll get down, and time will perfect, 
Cause I want you, girl I want you now, 
I'll do everything right the first time around, 
I want to, sex you up and lick you down, 
I said I want you, let me love you now 
I want to, sex you up, let me hold it down, 
I said I want you girl let me love you now. 

[Chorus] 

I can't remember where we met, it's all just a blur, 
But I know what I want, I've never been so sure, 
You're like a treasure, so innocent and pure, 
You become the addiction that my doctor can't cure, 
My friends talk, I don't listen cause they're missing the point, 
They'll never undestand us like I do, I'm after you, 
Cause you're special, you make me think of sexual things, 
Just a boy and a girl, just a king and his queen, 
Only a person that has felt love would know what I mean, 
Cause you got what it takes to make my heart sing, 
Baby make no mistake, you're the girl of my dreams, 
The kinda girl that I could love, that I'd put on my team, 
You could be my candy girl, the sparkle in my eye, 
My inspiration arm in arm, girl I need you by my side, 
I want to sex you up, let me hold it down, 
I said I want you girl, let me love you now, 
And everything I do, I do for you, 
And I could never live my life without, 
And late at night when I dream about you, 
I've heard of special, nothin' special like you. 

And everything I do, I do for you, 
And I could never live my life without, 
And late at night when I dream about you, 
I've heard of special, nothin' special like you, 
And no one knows ya quite like I do, 
I've heard of special, nothin' special like you, 
And no one knows ya quite like I do, 
I've heard of special, nothin' special like you 

(Special, you're so special, special, you're so special, special) 
(ah ah, ah ah, ah ah,) 
(Yea! Believe me. I know special when I see it. And nothing's special like you)",Special
Shifty,"Take away the pain
And let me fly away
Take away the pain
And let me fly away

This is a last dance
My last chance
To get it right

At first glance
You might think my life looks nice
But if you look a little closer
I walk on thin ice

I'm one slip from death
Twelve steps from paradise
A young america, riddled from 
Defects of character

A reject, caught in the web
Of mass hysteria
I pray for the world to change
I've seen my friends
Killed in pain

One fix from the end
One drink from insane
I'm stained

I'm lost with my brain broke
Comes second from smoked outs
To livin' the great hopes

So if your gonna save me
Better save me now
I'm an escape artist 
With no escape

I need a way out
My life is way out
The same old played out
Stuck on the same route

So I'm takin' a leap of faith
Hopin' I win this race
Hopin' this time I'm blessed
And don't miss

Cause I know and God knows
I really worked hard for this

[Chorus]

Now when I get away from trouble
I go lookin' for more
Takin' two steps back 
From the bridge to the shore

Tryin' to hustle muscles sore
From doin the devil's chores
Runnin' from my problems
Every gettin' to the door

Been runnin' 'round in circles
Down a dead end roads
I don't know where I'm going
But I act like I know

Borrowin' money 
To pay back what I owe
My head's a three-ring circus
I'm a one man show

Another tatooed freak
I was born in the jar
I was meant to be a sick confused
Loser rock star

So who's the puppet master
I went from county jail
To an open night disaster
Livin' faster gettin' faster

Now mamma's on the front porch
Sippin' on some wine
When daddys in his office
And he's choppin' up some limes
My sister's in the backyard
Smokin' on the green
My brother's in the basement 
Cookin' methamphetamine

[Chorus]

These thoughts collected
I'm tryin' to alter my perspective
I'm commin' to a hault
And to stop is my objective

Time is runnin' out
My luck is runnin' thin
I stuggled too long not to win
Or die tryin'

I see the clock tickin' 
My entire time is flyin'
I'm smilin' at defeats till
Inside I'm cryin'

Lookin' at the sky
Askin' why I can't live
A simple life its a lie
To say the grass ain't
Greener on the other side

A poor excuse for heaven sent
Cause I can't climb the fence
No matter how hard I try
I'm wrapped in barbbed-wire
Wonderin' who's on my side

Rusty knives in my back there's
No where left for me to hide
I'm wrapped up in sin
So I'm in for a ride

I'd commit suicide 
But I don't want to die
I'm sick of gettin' high 
And I'm sick of these games

There's not enough drugs to take
To take away the pain

Take away the pain, and let me fly away
Take away the pain, and let me fly away
Take away the pain, and let me fly away
Take away the pain, and let me fly away",Take Away the Pain
Shifty,"[Chorus:] 

These other girls, have been there too, 
Nothin' that I wouldn't do, for you, for you, 
You just keep on turning me on (on and on and on and on) 
You just keep on turning me on (on and on and on and on) 
You just keep on turning me on 

[Verse 1:] 

Now I've never had the feelin' that I get from you, 
It's hard to believe but I know it's true, 
You leave me breathless, you're precious, you're beautiful in every way, 
At first I second guessed it but our love won't fade, 
Every day I grow closer, with every word you say, 
Me and you have got something that no one's taking away, 
There were times that I thought I was in love before, 
I've been let down, I'm less now, shifty's got an angel and it's all for you, 
It's all for you, I ain't worried cause you know exactly what to do, 
And when everything's wrong you make it all ok, 
I come home stressed and you take it away, 
It's the little things you do, that mean so much, 
I need your love, your kiss, your touch, 
And it never gets old, I still feel the rush, 
You got everything I want and I can never get enough. 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 2:] 

Now there's me and you, and everyone else, 
I remember when I used to only think about myself, 
But you changed that fast, love is changing me, 
I used to be a playa then we came to be, 
True chemistry, I believe you're my destiny, 
Cause I'm free when you're next to me, 
You're a lady in the living room, a freak in the bedroom, 
Oh so for real when I'm bumpin' to neck tunes, 
You can nibble on my neck, don't stop too soon, 
Let me know before you cum so I can cum with you, 
This is sexual healin', and I'm a sex fiend, 
So let's stay together like my name was Al Green, 
Yea, I got you, like I told you so, 
I'ma hold you in my arms and never let go, 
And at first I smiled, and then you blushed, 
You got everything I want and I can never get enough. 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3:] 

The way you move, just turns me on, 
You steal my breath, you turn me on, 
You keep me up all night long, 
You just keep on turning me on, 
The way you move, just turns me on, 
You steal my breath, you turn me on, 
You keep me up all night long, 
You just keep on turning me on. 

(alright)

Shifty,"When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

When we were young 
Everything was so new
We broke all the rules
Just to do it
And I don't know how the hell
I lived through it
Young and on the run
Gettin' loaded like a gun
When we were young

Time sure flies
When your havin' fun
I wish I walked through life
But I chose to run

I used to beat for abuse
And play with guns
I played to pay the price
Till my life ain't done

I remember runnin' wild
Not a care in the world
It was all about graffiti
And chasin' the girls

Runnin' from the law
And bar room brawls
Gettin' arrested callin' home
With those late night calls
(when we were young)

Sorry mom I'm in jail again
Tonight I got arrested
With a couple of friends
You can either pick me up

Or you can send me some mint
Either way mom it looks like 
I messed up again

Back to my p.o. or rehab
Or up north to see dad
Its just the way it goes
You were born to be bad

I been a fool
Skippin' school
Flickin' off the principal
Its hard for mom to believe me
But she's so convincable

(When we were young)

[Chorus]

(When we were young)
Shoplifting gifts for the girls
With my boys
Walkin' out the sex shop
Pockets full of sex toys

And we rang the noise
Like you wouldn't believe
At sixteen started gettin' tattoos
Up my sleeve

So went up to thirty-two
Takin' part in dirty deeds
So if you want to get high 
I got whatever you need

And if you want to get 'em up
I ain't afraid to bleed
I've been to y.a. three times
So don't you step to me

And while you bragged to your parents
'bout your A's and be	's 
I was underneath the bleechers
With a t.h.c, a g.e.d, a chemical dependancy
And a p.h.d in whiskey and stoner-ology

Met the break-through
In ways to use technology
And you can learn from my mistakes
But its more fun to follow me

And its never too late
I don't hate who I've become
So that smokin' at the one
And we remember when we were young

[Chorus]

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

And while I'm waiting here

It haunted me from the start

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Said for gain
Said to cut down

But another part still burns
For the safety, for the comfort
But our hate outgrew our love and ate it

I can see it started years ago
And I recognise your pain
But I can't forget the innocence
That you've taken from me

No, I can't hate you
No, and I don't want to break you down
There's just some things that I want to tell you

I collect the poison as it spills from your mouth
Savour the taste so that I may work you out
When affection becomes affliction

Been watching for far too long
Far too long to get this wrong

Instead of putting me through your own design
You might start learning
Why so many of us feel we don't belong,
So unreal in what you built here,
'cause what you built here

Won't you let me find my own way
'cause what we've got happening here
Ain't nothing bad, ain't nothing you should fear
It's a celebration
'cause I learn from what you learn
But I burn for what you burn
And I think it's time we let the past lie 'cause the future is what I earn't
Pass this world on before the sun goes down
There's untapped beauty to be found
This time is my time

And that fills me up
And now I found

To get a hold of my security and the cloud that I flew from
And I'm ready to start now, this is what I waited for
And the vision it brings such a beautiful thing
That I'm brought to my knees as I finally learn to breathe

See that face in the mirror
Past bone and skin and into the heart of me
I celebrate this bleeding
If that's what scares you
If that's what's pulling you down

I don't love you 'cause I do

Sage „Guten Morgen liebe Sorgen“, doch erhalte keine Antwort

Meine Mama hat schon Frühstück gemacht, ich nehm' Platz
Kurz die verpassten Anrufe checken

Denn Mama is the best, check' die SMS
Wette, neue Message in WhatsApp von meiner Ex
Hater haten, aber wen int'ressiert's?
Hab den Wecker auf dem iPhone deinstalliert, yeah
Google nach dem Essen Histerien
Life is a bitch, doch die Schlampe is' in mich verliebt
Denn wenn ich meine erste Kippe rauche
Haben die meisten Leute Mittagspause

Erzähl' ihm, dass ich g'rade Texte schreibe und mein Kopf raucht
Und hoffe, dass er diesen Schrott glaubt

Mama lässt kurz klingeln, wenn mein essen fertig is'
Und dann werd' ich langsam wieder müde, find' den Weg ins Bett

Worte könn' nicht ausdrücken wie ich dich vermiss'.
Ich war so ein Bengel,
Oma war ein Engel.
Nur das Allerbeste gut genug für ihren Enkel.
Kannst du dich erinnern an den Tag, als ich mir Ohrlöcher stechen ließ,
Du hast geweint vor Enttäuschung, das vergess' ich nie.
Hab mich so sehr dafür geschämt, dass ich den Blick senkte.
Kein Tag mehr vergeht, an dem ich nicht an dich denke,
Eine starke Frau, stolz und immer gerade aus.
Wolltest, dass man mich auf den Namen deines Vaters tauft.
Oma brachte mir bedingunglose Liebe bei,
Oma stand um drei nachts auf und machte Spiegelei,
Denn für dich gab es nie was wichtigeres.
Und ich hab immer gebetet, dass du mich nie verlässt.
Hab mich weinend in mein Zimmer eingesperrt als du gings',
Und ich wünscht' ich könnt noch einmal hören wie sehr du mich liebst.

Wie du sagst du liebst mich mehr, als deinen Augapfel,

Und hat die wunderbarste Frau für mich zur Welt gebracht.
Oma's Weisheiten sind mehr wert, als alle Schätze dieser Erde,
'Ne ganze Bücherei kann nicht ersetzen, was ich lernte.
Leider wirst du meine Hochzeit nicht erleben,
Meine Kinder nicht erleben,
Kanns' noch immer nicht verstehn',
Aber ich glaub' der Himmel brauchte seinen Engel wieder.
Und sollt' ich je 'ne Tochter haben nenn' ich sie Sophia.

Lehrer glotzten mich dumm an so wie ein Alien
Damals hatt' ich ein' Apfel in der Fressbar-Box
Heute ist der Apfel auf dem Macintosh
Früher war ich unbeliebt
Doch da gibt es ein' ganz kleinen Unterschied, Ersguterjunge-Deal
10 Jahre später sollt' ich kriegen, was ich will
Die Hater und die Kritiker sind still, ich bleib' easy und ich chill'
Mein Leben ist ein Teeniefilm
Und deine Bitch schickt mir deswegen ein Bikini-Bild
Shindy ist so fly, sammelt Vielfliegermeilen
Business-Termin in Berlin um halb drei und ich schlafe, bis ich lande
Glotz' nicht, du Schlampe
Immer noch der selbe, spätabends an der Tanke
Es hat sich nichts geändert, außer mein Beruf
Warum ich alles schaffe? Weil ich schlauer bin als du

Warum ich das mach', was ich mach? Kein Plan
Ich wollt' schon immer reich sein
Und so viele Frau'n finden nachts kein' Schlaf
Wegen Mr. Nice Guy
Warum ich das mach', was ich mach? Kein Plan

Wegen Mr. Nice Guy, Mr. Nice Guy

Auf dem Rücksitz von dem Taxi durch die Rush Hour
Ich manage den Shit, Rudi Assauer
Hater nenn' mich Vogel, doch ein Vogel fliegt frei
Ich fühl' mich so wie Tyson vor dem Hollyfield-Fight
Dicka, rappen ist wie Boxsport
Und du bist nur dieser fette Typ vor dem Fernseher mit dem Popcorn
Ich habe letzte Nacht geträumt, dass ich ein Engel sei
Über den Wolken, die Flügel war'n Golden
Ließ die Sorgen laufen, spürte keine Angst
Wachte heute morgen auf und führte ein' Kampf
Und das ich den gewinne ist natürlich nich' willkürlich
Gott hat ein ausführlichen Plan für mich
Und bis ich mich seinem Gericht stell'n muss
Bleib' ich auf der Jagd und erhöh' den Geldfluss
Und solange ich das tu, ist noch immer nicht das Ende
Die Welt ist nicht genug, der Himmel ist die Grenze

Wegen mir bekommen ganze Schulen Hitzefrei
Meine Rhymes sind außerirdisch

Trotzdem hab ich immer dieses Topmodel aussehen
Fotographen wollen mich für Fotomotive

Zuhause musst du noch Bett bezieh'n

Nobody, nobody wants to live like this
Nobody, nobody wants a war like this

Swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart

And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45,
Swimming through the ashes of another life
No real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a 45

Send a message to the unborn child
Keep your eyes open for a while
In a box high up on the shelf, left for you, no one else

Wrapped in guilt, sealed up tight

Shinedown,"I lie here alone and wonder why
That I come alive, just before I have to hide.

Because I believe I'm losing my nerve
But could I ever do better than this

Because all I ever wanted was a place to call my home
To shelter me when I am there and to miss me when I'm gone
All I ever wanted was a place to call my own
Where stars may dance and sun still shines and the storms feel free to roam

I listen if only for a while
But I can't decide if I'm aware that I'm on trial

If there's a way to a remedy then lead me straight to it
If there's a path or a door I missed , then show me now, show me this

I am not perfect and I don't claim to be
And if that's what you wanted
Well then I'm so sorry

How about a better version of the way that I am?
How about a better version that makes me understand?
How about a better version of the way that I am?
The way I look, The way I speak,
How about a better version of me?

Excuse the wall, I put it up from time to time
A silver shade, and the design is all mine
It's just a maze that everyday I seem to be stuck in
It never seems to fade away but I pray for the day it ends

And tell me the one about the hand that holds you down
Because you seem to be lost, with no intention to be found

And how does it feel
To be the one whose always in the way
To be the words that never made the page
Be the one that's always

And tell me again about the man who went insane

Is there a voice inside with a decision

That's all you could ever take from me

Have you ever stepped out of the light and realized there's a stranger inside?

Well how do you know? Do I look blind?

Shows no emotion to a willing sacrifice

And you can cage an animal, but you can't take away the rage

And take away all these pills
And please just save me, if you can
From my blasphemy in my wasteland

And what went wrong
Couldn't handle forgiveness
Now I'm far beyond gone
And I can hardly remember
The look of my own eyes
How could I love this,
My life so dishonest
It made me compromise

Shinedown,"Two packs of cigarettes a day
The strongest whiskey
Kentucky can make
That's a recipe to put a vagabond
On his hands and knees
I watched it all up close
I knew him more than most
I saw a side of him, he never showed
Full of sympathy for a world that
Wouldn't let him be

That's the man he was
Have you heard enough?

What a shame, what a shame
To judge a life that you can't change
The choir sings, the church bells ring
So, won't you give this man his wings?
What a shame, to have to beg you to
See we're not all the same
What a shame

There's a hard life for every silver spoon
There's a touch of grey for every shade
Of blue
That's the way that I see life
If there was nothing wrong
Then there'd be nothing right
And for this working man they say could
Barely stand
There's gotta be a better place to land
Some kind of remedy for a world that
Wouldn't let him be

That's the man he was,
Have you heard enough?

What a shame, what a shame
To judge a life that you can't change
The choir sings, the church bells ring
So, won't you give this man his wings?
What a shame, to have to beg you to
See we're not all the same
What a shame

God forgive the hands that laid you down
They never knew how, but your broken
Heart can break the sound
And change the season
Now the leaves are falling faster
Happily ever after
You gave me hope through your endeavors
And now you will live forever

What a shame, what a shame
To judge a life that you can't change

No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

But passion's grip I fear
When I climb, into shallow vats of wine

Try to crawl into my head

So much I could say
I owe you a love song
Words that I can't say

Of sleepless summer nights
That took us away
A perfect place a different time
Back when nothing was wrong
Now were each sold separately
Our summers are gone
Grey skies are all I see

These broken days won't last forever
You know I'll put us back together

In the world you made for me
Makes staying in love
Just a world of make believe

Then I guess you've changed
Blackened by the temperature made
To spare my name

Became your home
For teaming me as back off of me

Now I'm waiting alone for you

'Cause I cannot cry over and over again

Do you really never see me when you come home late at night?
I'm always waiting alone for you

The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

That she can give you the world

How do you make it last? 
How do you keep the song from fading

How do you lose yourself to someone

How do you not run out of new things 
To say?

And since you know we're always changing 
How can it be the same?
And tell me how year after year 
You're sure your heart will fall apart 

Each time you hear his name?

That in your eyes I may not see forever, forever

Shirley Bassey,"Funny how a lonely day,
Can make a person say:
What good is my life
Funny how a breaking heart,
Can make me start to say:
What good is my life
Funny how I often seem,
To think I'll find another dream
(Or to think I'll never find a dream)
In my life Till I look around and see,
This great big world is part of me And my life

This is my life
Today, tomorrow, love will come and find me

Sometime when I feel afraid,
I think of what a mess I've made of my life
Crying over my mistakes,
Forgetting all the breaks I've had In my life
I was put on earth to be,
A part of this great world is me
And my life
Guess I'll just have to score,
And count the things I'm grateful for In my life

I never met it face to face
I never knew my heart could sing
I never missed a warm embrace

Till April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom
Holiday tables under the trees
April in Paris, this is a feeling
That no one can ever reprise

Shirley Bassey,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Shirley Bassey,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Shirley Bassey,"The night is bitter,
The stars have lost their glitter,
The winds grow colder,
And suddenly you're older
And all because of
The man that got away.

No more his eager call,
The writing's on the wall,
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray.
The man that won you
Has run off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen it's final inning,
Don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game.

No more that all-time thrill
For you've been through the mill,
And never a new love will
Be the same.

Good riddance, good-bye.
Every trick of his you're on to
But fools will be fools and where's he gone to?

The road gets rougher,
It's lonelier and tougher.
With hope you burn up,
Tomorrow he may turn up.
There's just no letup
The livelong night and day.

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman
Looking for the man that got away

Though by tomorrow you're gone;
The song is ended, but as the songwriter wrote,
The melody lingers on.
They may take you from me, I'll miss your fond caress.
But though they take you from me, I'll still possess.

The way you wear your hat
The way your sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

Born for you alone, happy to be your own
Where is she, where is the woman for me?

Is something you must earn.

Is your heart still as sure,
As it was in your dream?
Are you thoughts still as pure
And not what they may seem?

Were you always the same,
Taking others for fools?
Are you playing a game
And making up the rules?

Do you cherish your love,
Or regret with a sigh?
Will you laugh at the world
As each day passes by?

Now you want to be loved,
Yet you want to be free,
But love is not a game 
This can never be.

You're sincere you believe,
To yourself you are true,
But what can you achieve
When miracles are few?

Comes a time you awake
To the way you must live,
For those who love to take,
Sometimes have got to give.

If you want to be loved,
You can never be free,
So face up to the truth
And someday you may see
If you open your heart
And your heart can be true,

Shirley Bassey,"A time for us, some day there'll be
When chains are torn by courage born of a love that's free
A time when dreams so long denied can flourish
As we unveil the love we now must hide

A time for us, at last to see
A life worthwhile for you and me

And with our love, through tears and thorns
We will endure as we pass surely through every storm
A time for us, some day there'll be a new world
A world of shining hope for you and me

For you and me

And with our love, through tears and thorns
We will endure as we pass surely through every storm

Shirley Bassey,"The world is cold, the night is still 
The dream is old, and saws a thrill 
Some cool DJ, begins to play, a Wes Montgomery's score 
When you're all alone 

It's always 4 a.m. 
It had to last, it would go on 
But once it's passed, it's passed and gone 
You just pretend, it didn't end 

But make believe the blower 
When you're all alone 
It's always 4 a.m. 
Your thoughts take wings, but nothing brings 

That needed bit of slumber 
The phone then rings, your pour heart sings 
You left the phone, wrong number 
The sun is bright, the sky's a blaze 

But still it's night, there are no days 
And worst of all, right down the hall 
There's laughter through the door 
When you're all alone 

It's always 4 a.m. 
Your thoughts take wings, but nothing brings 
That needed bit of slumber 
The phone then rings, your pour heart sings 

You left the phone, wrong number 
The sun is bright, the sky's a blaze 
But still it's night, there are no days

Shirley Bassey,"Yesterday I heard the rain whispering your name
Asking where you'd gone
It fell softly from the clouds on the silent crowds
As I wandered on

Out of doorways black umbrellas came to pursue me
Faceless people as they passed were looking through me
No one knew me

Yesterday I shut my eyes, face up to the skies
Drinking in the rain
But your image still was there floating in the air
Brighter than a flame

Yesterday I saw a city full of shadows without pity
And I heard the steady rain whispering your name
Whispering your name

Asking where you'd gone

Yesterday I saw a city full of shadows without pity
And I heard the steady rain whispering your name
Whispering your name

Never were, really are, nearly are?

Will you ever be done traveling
Always unraveling you, you?
Running away could lead you further astray
And as for fishing in streams for pieces of dreams

Shirley Bassey,"Sing a song of sad, young men, glasses full of rye
All the news is bad again, kiss your dreams goodbye
All the sad, young men, sitting in the bars
Knowing neon nights and missing all the stars

All the sad, young men, drifting through the town
Drinking up the night, trying not to drown
All the sad, young men, singing in the cold
Trying to forget that they're growing old

All the sad, young men, choking on their youth
Trying to be brave, running from the truth
Autumn turns the leaves to gold, slowly dies the heart
Sad, young men are growing old, that's the cruelest part

All the sad, young men, seek a certain smile
Someone they can hold for just a little while
Tired, little girl, does the best she can
Trying to be gay for a sad, young men

While a grimy moon watches from above
All the sad, young men who play at making love
Misbegotten moon shine for sad young men
Let your gentle light guide them home again
All the sad, sad, sad, young men

When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

So many times when the city seems to be without a friendly face
A lonely place
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you
And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

Touch me and I end up singing
Troubles seem to up and disappear
You touch me with the love you're bringing
I can't really lose when you're near

If all my friends have forgotten half their promises
They're not unkind, just hard to find
One look at you and I know that I could learn to live
Without the rest, I found the best

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you",I Won't Last a Day Without You
Shirley Bassey,"Strumming my pain with his fingers,
singing my life with his words,
killing me softly with his song,
killing me softly with his song,
telling my whole life with his words,
killing me softly with his song

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style.
And so I came to see him to listen for a while.
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes.

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd,
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on.

He sang  as if  he knew me in all my dark despair
and then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there.
But he just came to singing, singing clear and strong.",Killing Me Softly With His Song
Shirley Bassey,"I'd like to run away from you,
But if you never found me I would die
I'd like to break the chains you put around me,
But I know I never will

You stay away and all I do is
Wonder why the hell I wait for you
But when did common sense prevail
For lovers when we know it never will

Impossible to live with you,
But I know, I could never live without you
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you

You never treat me like you should, so what's the good of loving as I do?
Although you always laugh at love,
Nothing else would be good enough for you

Impossible to live with you,
But I know, I could never live without you
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you

You make me laugh, you make me cry,
You make me live, you make me die, for you
You make me sing, you make me sad,
You make me glad, you make me mad, for you

I love you, hate you, love you, hate you
But I'll want you till the world stops turning
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you...
I love you, hate you, love you, hate you
But I'll want you till the world stops turning
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you...
I love you, hate you, love you, hate you
But I'll want you till the world stops turning
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you...

Love's a crazy game 
Two people vow to stay 
In love as one they say 

But all is changed with time 
The future no one can see 
The road you leave behind 
Ahead lies mystery 

But all is fair in love 
I had to go away

To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

All of fate's a chance 
It's either good or bad 
I tossed my coin to say 
In love with me you'd stay 

But all in war is so cold 
You either win or lose 
When all is put away 
The losing side I'll play 

But all is fair in love

Shirley Bassey,"You think you know me pretty well,
But how can you tell,
You never get inside my head.
The times we talk, we never speak,
We play hide and seek
So many things are left unsaid.
 
Why can't you see
What's on the other side of me,
The side of me that reaches out to you.
Sweet thoughts and dreams,
Like drops of rain on rippling streams
That wind and bend,
Rivers with no end,
Flowing on the other side of me.
 
It seems I always get unstrung
I trip on my tongue
With words that come out something else.
I'm so afraid the things I say
Might chase you away,
I have to hide behind myself.
 
Why can't you see
What's on the other side of me,
The side of me that reaches out to you.
Why must I hide
These feelings that have been denied.
Only you can set me free
See what's on the other side of me.

Shirley Bassey,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember

You couldn't really have a heart 
And hurt me like you hurt me

Shirley Bassey,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Could'nt stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying ev'rything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days my mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world
They were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be,
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

[Chorus]

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more
I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me
To know that every word is true

Shirley Bassey,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.
 
I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.

Shirley Bassey,"How insensitive I must have seemed
When she told me that she loved me.
How unmoved and cold I must have seemed
When she told me so sincerely.
Why,she must have asked, did I just turn
And stare in icy silence?
What was I to say? What can you say
When a love affair is over?

Now she's gone away and I'm alone
With the memory of her last look.
Vague and drawn and sad, I see it still,
All her heartbreak in that last look.
How, she must have asked, could I just turn
And stare in icy silence?
What was I to do? What can one do
When a love affair is over?",How Insensitive
Shirley Bassey,"I was a little too tall
Could've used a few pounds
Tight pants points hardly reknown
She was a black-haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points all her own sitting way up high
Way up firm and high

Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues
Workin' on our night moves
Tryin' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves
In the summertime
In the sweet summertime

We weren't in love, oh no, far from it
We weren't searchin' for some pie in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Livin' by the sword
And we steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, to the alley or the trusty woods
I used her, she used me
But neither one cared
We were gettin' our share
Workin' on our night moves
Tryin' to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves
And it was summertime

And oh the wonder
We felt the lightning
And we waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder

I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered
Started humming a song from 1962

Strange how the night moves
With autumn closing in",Night Moves

What good is my life
Funny how a breaking heart, can make me start to say

Till I look around and see, this great big world is part of me 
And my life
This is my life

But that's the way that I was born to be

Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Shirley Bassey,"he will not always say
what you would have him say
but now and then he'll say something wonderful

the thoughtless things he'll do
will hurt and worry you
then all at once he'll do
something wonderful



He has a thousand dreams 
That won't come true, 
You know that he believes in them 
And that's enough for you. 

You'll always go along, 
Defend him where he's wrong 
And tell him, when he's strong 
He is 
Wonderful 
He'll always 
Needs your love 
And so he'll get your love. 
A man who needs your love 
Can be 
Wonderful.

Have fun you happy people

I gotta find who's now number one

Yet there's that bold brave spring of the tiger that quickens your walk;
Oh, I believe in you,
I believe in you!

And when my faith in my fellow man all but falls apart,
I've got to feel your hand grasping mine and I take heart,

This is where our story ends,
Never lovers, ever friends.

But before you walk away,
I sincerely want to say:

I wish you bluebirds in the Spring,
To give your heart a song to sing;
And then a kiss, but more than this I wish you love.

And in July, a lemonade,
To cool you in some leafy glade;
I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be,
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.

I wish you shelter from the storm,
A cozy fire to keep you warm;
But most of all, when snowflakes fall,
I wish you love.

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

One can betray one's troubles never, whatever occurs!

Have to be bright,
Whether you're well or ill;
The people have to laugh their fill,
You mustn't sleep till dawn comes creeping.

Though I never really grumble,
Life's a jumble indeed!
And in my efforts to succeed
I've had to formulate a creed.

I believe in doing what I can,
In crying when I must
And laughing when I choose.
Heigh ho!
If love were all I should be lonely!

I believe the more you love a man,
The more you give your trust,
The more you're bound to lose;
Although, when shadows fall I think if only
Somebody splendid really needed me,
Somebody affectionate and dear,
Cares would be ended
If I knew that he wanted to have me near.

But I believe that, since my life began,
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse,

Shirley Bassey,"It must have been cold there in my shadow 
To never have sunlight on your face 
You were content to let me shine 
You always walked a step behind 

I was the one with all the glory 
While you were the one with all the strength 
Only a face without a name 
I never wants heard you complain 

Did you ever know that you're my hero 
And everything I would like to be 
I can fly higher than an eagle 
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings 

It might have appeared to go unnoticed 
But I have it all here in my heart 
I want you to know, I know the truth 
I would be nothing with out you 

Did you ever know that you're my hero 
And everything I would like to be 
I can fly higher than an eagle

Shirley Bassey,"Yesterday when I was young
the taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue.
I teased at life as if it were a foolish g ame,
the way the evening breeze may tease a candle fl ame.
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand.
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
and only now I see how the years ran away.

Yesterday when I was young
so many drinking songs were waiting to be sung,
so many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
and so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see.
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think what life was all about
and every conversation I can now recall
concerned itself with me and nothing else at all.

Yesterday the moon was blue
and every crazy day brought something new to do.
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
and never saw the waste and emptiness beyond.
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
and every flame I lit too quickly quickly died.
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
and only I am left on stage to end the play.
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung,
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue.
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday when I was young.",Yesterday
Shirley Bassey,"Now you say you love me
But you cry the whole night through
You can cry me a river 
Oh yes you're goin' to cry me a river 
'Cause I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry for being so untrue
You may cry a river
You may cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Yes I did child, yes I did my child

You drove me nearly out of my head
You stood by and never shed a tear
But I remember every word that was said
Oh yes, I remember - never fear

You may cry me a river - c'mon now
Cry me a river
You may cry me a river
I cried a river for you (Oh how I cried)

You nearly drove me out of my own sweethead
You stood by - you never shed a tear for me.
I remember every crual word - everything that was said
Yes I remember - never you fear

You may cry me a river
I cried a river for you
Yes I cried a river for you

Turn back the tide of life, I cried - salty water runnin' down
I cried I love you
I cried I love you

You may cry, oh, she may cry now, a river of tears 
A river of tears for you
You may cry now, she may cry, oh, she may cry now

Shirley Bassey,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize

So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

Shirley Bassey,"Every time we say goodbye, I die a little
Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know
think so little of me that they allow you go

When your near there's such an air of Spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer but how strange
The change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye",Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye
Shirley Bassey,"I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol
Doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if
I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously don't adore me

Some get a kick in a plane
Flying too high
With some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
But I get a kick out of you
I get a kickout of you",I Get a Kick Out of You
Shirley Bassey,"If you go away, on this summer day 
Then you might as well take the sun away 
All the birds that flew in the summer sky 
When our love was new and our hearts were high 
When the day was young and the night was long 
And the moon stood still for the night birds' song 
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away 
But if you stay, I'll make you a day 
Like no day has been or will be again 
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain 
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind 
Then if you go, I'll understand 
Leave me just enough love to hold in my hand 
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away 
If you go away, as I know you will 
You must tell the world to stop turning till 
You return again, if you ever do 
For what good is love without loving you 
Can I tell you now as you turn to go 
I'll be dying slowly till the next hello 
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away 
But if you stay I'll make you a night 
Like no night has been or will be again 
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch 
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much 
But if you go I won't cry 
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye 
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away 
If you go away as I know you must 
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust 
Just an empty room full of empty space 
Like the empty look I see on your face 
I'd have been the shadow of your dog 
If I thought you might have kept me by your side 
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away",If You Go Away (Ne Me Quitte Pas)

While life goes on around him everywhere

From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over, but the words got in the way

Thoughts of leaving disappear every time I see your eyes 
No matter how hard I try

Shirley Bassey,"Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue.
I teased at life as if it were a foolish g ame,
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle fl ame.
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand.
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
And only now I see how the years ran away.

Yesterday when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see.
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all.

Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do.
I used my magic age as if itwere a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond.
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly quickly died.
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play.
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung,
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue.
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday when I was young.","Yesterday, When I Was Young"
Shirley Bassey,"When you walk through a storm
Hold your chin up high
And don't be afraid of the dark.
At the end of a storm
Is a golden sky
And the sweet, silver song of a lark.

Walk on, through the wind,
Walk on, through the rain,
Though your dreams be tossed and blown.
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart,
And you'll never walk alone,
You'll never walk alone.

The atmosphere as thrilling here as always

Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now

I've come home at last!

And brighter than we knew it.
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it...
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment with so much to live for?

You know I'm right, it's there in black and white
When I look your way, you'll hear what I say

Yes, with one look, I  put your words to shame

One tear from my eye makes the whole world cry

With one look, they'll forgive the past
They'll rejoice, I've returned at last
To my people in the dark
Still out there in the dark

Silent music starts to play

With one look, I'll ignite a blaze
I'll return to my glory days

I'll be back where I was born to be
With one look, I'll be me

Shirley Bassey,"If you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young, and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the nightbird's song
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away 

But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you will
You must tell the world to stop turning 'til
You return again, if you ever do
For what good is love without loving you?
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly 'til the next hello?
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go, go! I won't cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room, full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
I'd have been the shadow of your shadow
If I thought it might have kept me by your side
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away",If You Go Away (Ne Me Quitte Pas) [DJ Skymoo Mix]

If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch at a church
Where people saying : ""My God, that's tough""
""She stood him up""
""No point in us remaining""
""We may as well go home""

Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay 
Looking forward to who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play ?
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
Who if He really does exist
Why did He desert me ?
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?  What do we do?

Alone again, naturally

Looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day

When she told me that she loved me
How unmoved and cold I must have seemed
When she told me so sincerely

Why, she must have asked, did I just turn
And stare in icy silence?
What was I to say? What can you say
When a love affair is over?

Now she's gone away and I'm alone
With the memory of her last look
Vague and drawn and sad, I see it still
All her heartbreak in that last look

How, she must have asked, could I just turn
And stare in icy silence?

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear,
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.

I've lived a life that's full,
I travelled each and every highway,
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Regrets, I've had a few,
But then again too few to mention
Did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
Planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it My Way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it My Way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught. 
To say the things he truly feels; 
And not the words of one who kneels.

I took the blows - 
And did it my way!",My Way

That lived within the heart of me

And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love
Shirley Bassey,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

Shirley Bassey,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When
Shirley Bassey,"I am what I am
I am my own special creation
So come take a look
Give me the hook or the ovation

It's my world that I want to have a little pride in
My world and it's not a place I have to hide in
Life's not worth a damn till you can say
Hey world I am what I am

I am what I am
I don't want praise
I don't want pity
I bang my own drum

Some think it's noise
I think it's pretty
And so what if I love each feather and each spangle
Why not try and see things from a different angle

Your life is a sham till you can say
Hey world I am what I am
I am what I am
And what I am needs no excuses

I deal my own deck
Sometimes the ace
Sometimes the deuces
It's my life and there's no return and no deposit

One life, so it's time to open up your closet

Shirley Bassey,"Time and again I've longed for adventure,
Something to make my heart beat the faster.
What did I long for? I never really knew.
Finding your love I've found my adventure,
Touching your hand, my heart beats the faster,
All that I want in all of this world is you.

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long.
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.

You are the angel glow that lights a star,
The dearest things I know are what you are.
Some day my happy arms will hold you,
And some day I'll know that moment divine,
When all the things you are, are mine!",All the Things You Are

There's somebody thinking of you
I'm the one who'll never hurt you
Maybe that's because I love you

Maybe it's late, but just call me
Tell me, and I'll be around

Shirley Bassey,"When we played our charade
We were like children posing
Playing at games, acting out names
Guessing the parts we played

Oh what a hit we made
We came on next to closing
Best on the bill, lovers until
Love left the masquerade

Fate seemed to pull the strings
I turned and you were gone
While from the darkened wings
That music box played on

Sad little serenade
Song of my heart's composing
I hear it still, I always will
Best on the bill

Shirley Bassey,"Girl we made it to the top
we went so high we couldn't stop
we climbed the ladder leading us nowhere 
Two of us together building castles in the air 
We spun so fast we couldn't tell 
the gold ring from the carousel 
How could we know the right would turn-out bad
Everything we wanted, was everything we had
I miss the Hungry Years 
the once upon a time 
the lovely long ago 
we didn't a dime 
those days of me and you, 
we lost along the way 
how could I be so blind 
not to see the door 
closing on the World 
I now hunger for 
Looking through my tears, 
I miss the Hungry years
We shared our day dreams one by one 
Making plans was so much fun 
We set our goals and reached the highest star 
Things that we were after were much better from afar
Here we stand just me and you 
with everything and nothing too 
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay 
Honey take me home Let's go back to yesterday
I miss the Hungry Years 
the once upon a time the lovely long ago 
we didn't have a dime 
those days of me and you, 
we lost along the way 
how could I be so blind 
not to see the door 
closing on the World I now hunger for 
Looking through my tears, 
I miss the Hungry years

",The Hungry Years
Shirley Bassey,"There may be trouble ahead,
But while there's music and moonlight,
And love and romance,
Let's face the music and dance.
Before the fiddlers have fled,
Before they ask us to pay the bill,
And while we still have that chance,
Let's face the music and dance.
Soon, we'll be without the moon,
Humming a different tune, and then, 
There may be teardrops to shed,
So while there's music and moonlight,
And love and romance,
Let's face the music and dance.   


",Let's Face the Music and Dance
Shirley Bassey,"Well, this is one of those songs that you hear now and then
You don't know just where and you don't know just when
It's one of those songs that are over and then
It's one of those songs that starts playing again

Yes, it's one of those songs that you hear for awhile
That come into fashion, then go out of style
It's one of those songs that you think you forgot
But it's one of those songs you cannot

Because it's one of those songs that can make you recall
A ride in the springtime, a walk in the fall
A day in the country, a night on the town
The sun coming up or the rain coming down

Or else the evening you parted, the morning you met
The love of your life you can never forget
The reason is simple, the memory belongs
To one of those wonderful songs

Well, this is one of those songs that's so easy to hear
You listen just once, and you play it by ear
It's hummed on verandas and strummed on guitars
And all you remember is ""lah-dah-dah-dah""

But later on you recall it in some other year
You may start to smile or you may shed a tear
You'll find that a part of your lifetime belongs
To one of those wonderful songs",One of Those Songs (Girls of de Folies Bergère)
Shirley Bassey,"The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
that rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over
stones on its way
To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I've heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more",The Sound of Music
Shirley Bassey,"Funny how a lonely day,
Can make a person say:
What good is my life
Funny how a breaking heart,
Can make me start to say:
What good is my life
Funny how I often seem,
To think I'll find another dream
(Or to think I'll never find a dream)
In my life till I look around and see,
This great big world is part of me and my life

This is my life
Today, tomorrow, love will come and find me
But that's the way that I was born to be
This is me
This is me

This is my life
And I don't give a damn for lost emotions
I've such a lot of love I've got to give
Let me live

Sometime when I feel afraid,
I think of what a mess I've made of my life
Crying over my mistakes,
Forgetting all the breaks I've had in my life
I was put on earth to be,
A part of this great world is me
And my life
Guess I'll just have to score,
And count the things I'm grateful for in my life

Shirley Bassey,"You can have him, I don't want him 
He's not worth fighting for 
Besides there's plenty more where he came from 
I don't want him, you can have him 
I'm givin' him the sack 
So he can go right back, where he came from 
I'm afraid I never loved him 
He'd be better off with you 
I could never make him happy 
All I ever wanted to do was 
Run my fingers through his curly locks 
Mend his clothing, darn his socks 
(Live at The Pigalle: Mend his underware and darn his socks)
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes 
Wipe his glasses when he read the news 
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch 
Mornings after when he had a little to much 
Kiss him gently when he cuddled near 
And give him babies one for every year 
So you see 
That you can have him, I don't want him 
I don't want him, you can have him 
Because he's not the man for me 
Then I close the windows while he soundly slept 
Then I brayed the icebox where the food is kept 
I'd fix him breakfast that would please him most 
(Live at Talk Of The Town: I'd fix him breakfast he prefers the most)
Eggs and coffee and some buttered toast 
... (crying)
Then I go out and buy the papers 
And when they've been read 
Spend the balance of the day in bed 
So you see 
That you can have him, I don't want him 
I don't want him, you can have him 
Because he's not my man 
I don't want him, you can have him 
You can have him, I don't want him

Shirley Bassey,"I lost at love before,
Got mad and closed the door.
But you said try just once more.
I chose you for the one,
Now I'm having so much fun.
You treated me so kind,
I'm about to lose my mind.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.

The others were untrue,
But when it came to lovin' you,
I'd spend my whole life with you.
'Cause you came and you took control,
You touched my very soul.
You always showed me that
Loving you was where it's at.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.

That you're even in my dreams.
I hear you calling me.
I'm so in love with you,
All I ever want to do is

Shirley Bassey,"If you go away, on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the night birds' song
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to hold in my hand
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you will
You must tell the world to stop turning till
You return again, if you ever do
For what good is love without loving you
Can I tell you now as you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly till the next hello
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

But if you stay I'll make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go I won't cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away as I know you must
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
I'd have been the shadow of your dog
If I thought you might have kept me by your side
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away",If You Go Away
Shirley Bassey,"Johnny could only sing one note,
And the note he sang was this,
""Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!""

Poor Johnny One Note
Sang out with gusto,
And just overlorded the place!
Poor Johnny One Note
Yelled willy-nilly,
Until he was blue in the face,
For holding one note was his ace!

Couldn't hear the brass,
Couldn't hear the drums;
He was in a class
By himself, by gum!

Poor Johnny One Note
Got on Aida,
Indeed a
Great chance to be brave!
He took his one note,
How like the north wind,
Brought forth wind
That made crics rave,
While Verdi turned round in his grave!

Couldn't hear the flute,
Or the big trombone,
Every one was mute,
Johnny stood alone!

Cats and dogs stopped yappin',
Lions in the zoo
All were jealous of Johnny's big trill.
Thunder claps stopped clappin',
Traffic ceased its roar,
And they tell us Niagara stood still!

He stopped the train whistles,
Boat whistles,
Steam whistles,
Cop whistles;
All whistles bowed to his skill!

Sing, Johnny One Note,
Sing out with gusto
And just overload all the clouds,
So sing, Johnny One Note, out loud!

Shirley Bassey,"I know your leaving's too long overdue 
For far too long I've had nothing new to show to you 
Goodbye dry eyes, I watched your plane 
Fade off west of moon

Then it felt so strange to walk away alone 
No regrets 
No tears goodbye 
Don't want you back 

We'd only cry again 
Say goodbye again 
The hours that were yours, echo like empty rooms 
But the thoughts we used to share 

Now I keep alone
I woke last night and spoke to you 
Not thinking you were gone
Then it felt so strange to lie awake alone 

No regrets 
No tears, goodbye 
Don't want you back 
We'd only cry again 

Say goodbye again 
All friends have tried to turn my nights to day 
Strange faces in your place 
Can't keep the goss away

But just beyond the darkest hour 
Just behind the dawn
It still feels so strange to lead my life alone

Shirley Bassey,"Lovers depend on moonlight
For a love affair
Babies depend on mothers
For their tender care
Flowers depend on sunshine
And the morning dew
Each thing depends on something
And I depend on you

I can be happy, I can be sad
I can be good or I can be bad
It all depends on you
I can be lonely out in a crowd
I can be humble, I can be proud
It all depends on you
I can save money, or spend it
Go right on living, or end it
You're to blame, Honey
For what I do
I know that I can be beggar
I can be King
I can be almost any old thing
It all depends on you

Isn't it sweet to know, Dear
You can help me on
Wouldn't it hurt to know, Dear
All my hopes were gone
Wouldn't it make you proud, Dear
If I made a name
But if I failed to win, dear
Would you want all the blame

I can be happy, I can be sad
I can be good or I can be bad
It all depends on you
I can be lonely out in a crowd
I can be humble, I can be proud
It all depends on you
I can save money, or spend it
Go right on living, or end it
You're to blame, honey

Yes, it all depends on you",It All Depends on You [#]
Shirley Bassey,"Johnny could only sing one note 
And the note he sang was this: aaaahh 
Poor Johnny One Note 

Sang out with Gusto 
And just overloaded the place
Poor Johnny One Note 
Yelled willy-nilly 
Until he was blue in the face
For holding one note was his ace 
Couldn't hear the brass 
Couldn't hear the drum
He was in a class 
By himself, by gum
Poor Johnny One Note 

Got in Aida indeed a great chance to be brave
He took his one note 
Howled like the North Wind 
Brought forth wind that made critics rave
While Verdi turned round in his grave 
Couldn't hear the flute 

Or the big trombone
Everyone was mute 
Johnny stood alone
Cats and dogs stopped yapping 
Lions in the zoo 
Were all jealous of Johnny's big thrill
Thunderclaps stopped clapping 
Traffic ceased its roar 
And they tell us Niag'ra stood still
He stopped the trainwistles 
Boatwhistles 
Steamwhistles 
Copwhistles
All whistles bowed to his skill 
Sing Johnny One Note 
Sing out with gusto 
And just overwhelm all the crowd 
Aaaahh 

So sing, Johnny One Note out loud 
Sing, Johnny One Note 
Sing - Johnny - One Note - Out loud",Johnny One Note [#]

When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

Shirley Bassey,"Some sleepless night, 
If you should find yourself alone,
Let me be the one you run to,
Let me be the one you come to 
When you need someone to turn to, 
Let me be the one.

To set things right 
When this old world's turned upside down,
Let me be the one you run to,
Let me be the one you come to 
When you need someone to turn to, 
Let me be the one.

For love and understanding, 
To find a quiet place;
For silent understanding, 
A loving touch.
Come to me when things go wrong 
And there's no love to light the way.

Shirley Bassey,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right

I'll come back on my knees some day?

Shirley Bassey,"Give 'em the old razzle dazzle 
Razzle dazzle 'em
Give 'em an act with lots of flash in it 
And the reaction will be passionate
Give 'em the old hocus pocus 
Bead and feather 'em
How can they see with sequins in their eyes? 
What if your hinges all are rusting? 
What if, in fact, you're just disgusting? 
Razzle dazzle 'em 
And they'll never catch wise
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle 
Razzle dazzle 'em
Back in the days of old Methusulah 
Everyone loves the big bamboozulah
Give 'em the old three ring circus 
Stun and stagger 'em
When you're in trouble 
Go into your dance
Though you are stiffer than a girder 
They let you get away with murder
Razzle dazzle 'em 
And you got a romance
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle 
Razzle dazzle 'em
Give 'em an act that's unassailable 
They'll wait a year till you're available
Give 'em the old wobble bammy 
Daze and dizzy 'em
Show 'em the first rate sorcere you are 
Long as you keep 'em way off balance 
How can they spot you got no talents?

Can make a person say:
What good is my life
Funny how a breaking heart,
Can make me start to say:
What good is my life

To think I'll find another dream
(Or to think I'll never find a dream)

This great big world is part of me And my life

This is my life

I think of what a mess I've made of my life
Crying over my mistakes,
Forgetting all the breaks I've had In my life
I was put on earth to be,
A part of this great world is me
And my life
Guess I'll just have to score,
And count the things I'm grateful for In my life

Some is good, some is bad

Shirley Bassey,"Oh! They say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune,
One that they could croon 
As only they can.

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro.
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

From a whippoorwill out on a hill,
They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note.

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it,
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues

And I wonder what you do 
Are you somewhere feeling lonely

Was so exciting

Had no intention to do the things we've done.

But then we're two of a kind, we move as one.

We're an all time high, we'll change all that's gone before.
Doing so much more than falling in love.
On an all time high, we'll take on the world and wait.
So hold on tight, let the flight begin.

I'm in so strong and so deep, and so are you.
In my time I've said these words before, but now I realize

I tell myself don't be a fool
Play the field have a lot of fun
It's easy when you play it cool

I tell myself don't be a chump
Who cares, let him stay away
That's when the phone rings and I jump
And as I grab the phone I pray

Let it please be him, oh dear God
It must be him or I shall die
Or I shall die
Oh hello, hello my dear God
It must be him but it's not him
And then I die
That's when I die

After a while, I'm myself again
I take the pieces off the floor
Put my heart on the shelf again
You'll never hurt me anymore

I'm not a puppet on a string
I'll find somebody else someday
That's when the phone rings, and once again
I start to pray

Let it please be him, oh dear God
It must be him , it must be him
or I shall die, Or I shall die
Oh hello, hello my dear God
It must be him but it's not him
And then I die

One day in early spring
You held a piper in your hand
To mend it's broken wing
Now I remember many a day
And many a lonely mile
The echo of a piper song
The shadow of a smile

The shadow of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes, my love, and see
All the lovely things, you are, to me

Our wistful little star
Was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I
Now when I remember spring
All the joy that the love can bring
I will be remembering

Like painted skies, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the bright blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than

And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I got the chance to say
That I do believe I love you

And if I should ever go away
Well then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember

Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me, for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for

Well you came in loving me
And now there's so much more I see
And so by the way I thank you

Oh and then for the times when we're apart
Well then close your eyes and know
The words are coming from my heart
And then if you can remember",That's What Friends Are For [Main Version]
Shirley Bassey,"I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Adore you and want you so
I'm just a no one with nothing to give you but, oh
I love you

He, he buys you diamonds
Bright, sparkling diamonds
But, believe me, dear, when I say
That he can give you the world but he'll never love the way
I love you

He can take you any place he wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
But I can only watch you with
My nose pressed up against the window pane

I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Must watch you go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else when, darling, it's I
Who loves you

I love you
I love you
I love you",I Who Have Nothing
Shirley Bassey,"All of you ladies out there turn up your radio
Girls, I'm about to tell you something You may wanna know
You know things they're not always
What they appear to be
And I don't want to happen to you
What happened to me

Listen, There are no words that can describe, what I felt inside
When I found out the man I loved loved another guy
We were at a party, Ohh to have a little fun
But when I looked around my-my man was missing
I walked outside, I couldn't believe my eyes
He was in Bill's arms breathin hard and french kissin

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man

Bill has been to my house a thousand times
He and my man would go camping and fishing
Oh I tell you it never crossed my mind
Bill was a friend and he was God Uncle to my only son
Now it looks Uncle Billy wants to be his step-mom

Now you see I was ready for Mary, I was ready for Jane
How do a woman compete with a man for another man

I asked my man why didnt you tell me that you were gay
when you knew, knew I build my world around you
I knew I had those feelings and I didn't want it to be
I thought by being with you, Girl I thought it would change
As tears came to my eyes, hesays I'm sorry I hurt you so
I got to pack Bill is waiting for me and I got to go

I was ready for Mary, I was ready for Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man
Thank you for using Top40db.com.

I don't feel ashame and I don't take the blame
My man was just a queen, he was a Queen that thought he was a King
He told before he left he said
I know you're hurt and oh I know you're mad
But if that's not asking too much,
could you tell my son I love him and I'm still his dad

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man
Bill used to come over to my house, I used to fix him my food
I used to loan Bill my money, all the time he was in there tryin' to get
my honey",Bill
Shirley Bassey,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring
Shirley Bassey,"I know your leaving's too long overdue 
For far too long I've had nothing new to show to you 
Goodbye dry eyes, I watched your plane 
Fade off west of moon
Then it felt so strange to walk away alone 
No regrets 
No tears goodbye 
Don't want you back 
We'd only cry again 
Say goodbye again 
The hours that were yours, echo like empty rooms 
But the thoughts we used to share 
Now I keep alone
I woke last night and spoke to you 
Not thinking you were gone
Then it felt so strange to lie awake alone 
No regrets 
No tears, goodbye 
Don't want you back 
We'd only cry again 
Say goodbye again 
All friends have tried to turn my nights to day 
Strange faces in your place 
Can't keep the goons away
But just beyond the darkest hour 
Just behind the dawn
It still feels so strange to lead my life alone 
No regrets 
No tears, goodbye 
Don't want you back 
We'd only cry again 
Say goodbye again",No Regrets (Non Je Ne Regrette Rien)
Shirley Bassey,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Shirley Bassey,"Sunshine, go away today
I don't feel much like dancin'
Some man's come, he's tried to run my life
Don't know what he's asking

He tells me I better get in line,
Can't hear what he's sayin'
When I grow up, I'm gonna make him mind
These ain't dues I've been payin'

How much does it cost? I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost, I'll try it
He can't even run his own life
I'll be damned if he'll run mine, Sunshine...

Sunshine go away today
I don't feel much like dancin'
Some man's come, he's tried to run my life
Don't know what he's askin'

Workin' starts to make me wonder where
Fruits of what I do are going
When he says in love and war all is fair
He's got cards he ain't showin'

How much does it cost? I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost, I'll try it
He can't even run his own life
I'll be damned if he'll run mine, Sunshine...

Sunshine, come on back another day
I promise you I'll be singing
This old world, she's gonna turn around
Brand new bells'll be ringing",Sunshine
Shirley Bassey,"In my most secure moments I still can't believe
I'm spending these moments with you
On the ground I am walking, the air that I breathe
Are shared in these moments with you

You love for real
You show the feel
Of everything that touches you

In the songs I've been singing quite often a phrase
Comes close to the feeling of you
But I never suspected that one of those days
The wish of the song would come true

You love for real
You show the feel
Of everything that touches you

You are of gracefulness
You are of happiness
You are what I would guess to be most like
What I've been singing of

In my most secure moments I still can't believe
I'm spending these moments with you
On the ground I am walking, the air that I breathe
Are shared in these moments with you

You love for real
You show the feel
Of everything that touches you

Love love
Love",Everything That Touches You
Shirley Bassey,"Whatever it is, it'll keep 'til the morning. 
Haven't we both got better things to do? 
Midnight Blue. 
Even though simple things become rough. 
Haven't we had enough? 

And I think we can make it 
One more time 
If we try
One more time for all the old times. 

For all of the times you told me you need me. 
Needing me now is something I could use. 
Midnight Blue. 
Wouldn't you give your hand to a friend? 
Maybe it's not the end. 

And I think we can make it 
One more time 
If we try
One more time for all the old times. 

Wouldn't you give your heart to a friend?
Think of me as your friend

I think we can make it 
If we try, 
Looks like we can make it 
If we try",Midnight Blue

Shirley Bassey,"Kiss the day goodbye
The sweetness and the sorrow
We did what we had to do
And I can't regret what I did for love, what I did for love

Look my eyes are dry
And towards always tomorrow
It's as if we always knew
But I won't forget what I did for love, what I did for love

Gone, love is never gone
And we carry on, love's what we'll remember

Kiss the day goodbye
And point me toward tomorrow
And wish me luck, the same to you
Won't regret, can't forget what I did for love

What I did for love
What I did for love",What I Did for Love
Shirley Bassey,"There was a man, a lonely man
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unshared
Until it died in his silence

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

A little hope, goes up in smoke
Just how it goes, goes without saying
There was a man, a lonely man
Who would command the hand he is playing

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

Solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire",Solitare

Shirley Bassey,"At first I was afraid I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side;
But then I spent so many nights
Thinkin' how you did me wrong

And I grew strong
And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock

I should have made you leave your key
If I'd've known for just one second you'd back to bother me
Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now

('Cause) you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Did I crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not.I. I will survive
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive;
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give and I'll survive,

I will survive. Hey hey.
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart,
And I spent oh so many nights

Just feeling sorry for myself. I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high
And you see me somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you,

And so you feel like droppin' in
And just expect me to be free,
Now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me
Go on now.. etc.",I Will Survive

I take a book down from the shelf
And what with programs on the air
I keep pretty much to myself

Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Might have gone but what for

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

Shirley Bassey,"When all the world is a hopeless jumble
and the raindrops tumble all around,
Heaven opens a magic lane.
When all the clouds darken up the skyway,
there's a rainbow highway to be found,
Leading from your windowpane.
To a place behind the sun,
Just a step beyond the rain.

Somewhere over the rainbow way up high,
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby,
Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue,
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
and wake up where the clouds are far behind me,
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

I thought that cards were a frame-up
I never would try
Now I'm taking that game up
And the ace of hearts is high

Things are mending now
I see a rainbow blending now
We'll have a happy ending now

Here I slip again
About to take that trip again
I got that grip again

That I can make life move again

Barbara, this is Shirley

I was going through my

So woman to woman
I don`t think it`s being anymore than fair 
To call you and let you know 
Where I`m coming from

Now Barbara 
I don`t know how you`re gonna take this
But whether you be cool 
Or come out of a bag on me
You see it doesn`t really make any difference

But it`s only fair that I let you know that
The man you`re in love with
He's mine

From the top of his head 
To the bottom of his feet
The bed he sleeps in 
And every piece of food he eats

You see, I make it possible 
The clothes on his back
Ha ha, I buy them
The car he drives
I pay the note every month

So I`m telling you these things
To let you know how much I love that man 
And woman to woman
I think you`ll understand
How much I`ll do to keep him

Can`t you see where I`m coming from
Woman to woman
Ain`t that the same thing you would`ve done

Now should I just step aside
And let her take what`s rightfully mine

Was I right or was I wrong
I ain`t gonna let you break up my happy home

Now woman to woman
Now you see I don't want no trouble now

Shirley Caesar,"You know, all too soon seemly our children grow up overnight
They get married; some of them go to college
They move away from home to New York and Chicago 
and to some other places
But the saddest thing about it is that they forget 
that they have a darling mother back home
So it is I’m thinking about a young man who left
 and moved away to Germany, and while he was there
he was critically wounded so much so that the doctor 
said, “that he would never walk again”
He had braces on his legs and another sad thing happen to that young man
He lost his mother. And the family tried 
to get in touch with him but to no avail
And finally we see that young man standing 
with braces on his legs before a fresh grave
with on faded rose in his hand
As he began to drop the peddles from the rose on that grace
he began to talk to his mother
These are some of the words he was saying to his mother

Peddles form this faded roses momma
is all I have to give
But momma I tried to give you flowers
every now and then (now and then) 
Oh yes I did

If I had a million dollars, I would line your grave with gold
but wouldn’t wake you from your sleep, as eternal ages grow
Verse 2
So peddle form this faded rose is all have to give
But momma I tried to make you happy, while you lived

You know while that young man stood there
dropping the peddles on the fresh grave
two of his sisters drove up in a big fine car
they got out and they put their arm about his shoulder
One of his sisters said “Brother don’t cry
said you know we did all we could to get in touch with you
But one thing I did, I knew that you would be pleased with
I took my diamond ring and placed it
on momma’s finger and the other sister said
Brother, so do you remember that fur coat that I had
I draped it about momma’s shoulders
but the young man standing there crying
couldn’t think about diamonds and furs
All he could think of was the best thing he had was gone
and with the few more peddles left on the rose
he continue to drop them on the grave and he said to his mother

Diamond rings and silver things momma
I never had, I never had to give
but momma I tried to give you a flower every now and then

If I had a million dollars, I’d line your grave with gold
but that wouldn’t wake you from your sleep, as eternal ages grow",Faded Rose

Why should the shadows come?
Why should my heart be lonely

His tender word I hear
And resting on His goodness
I loose my doubts and fears
Though by the path He leadeth
But one step I may see

Whenever clouds arise
When song gives place to sighing
When hope within me dies

You turned me around with one touch of your hand

And chat for awhile with me,
For it's been three quarters of a long year or more,
Since I spoke one word to thee.

I shan't come in, I shan't set down,
I ain't got a moment's time,
And since you are engaged with another true love,
Then your heart is no longer mine.

When you were mine, my old true love,
Then your lead lay on my breast,
You could make me believe by the falling of your arm,
That the sun rose up in the west.

There is many the star shall jingle in the west,
There is many the leaf below,
There is many the damn that shall lite upon a man,
For treating a poor girl so.

I wish to the Lord I'd never been born,
Or had died when I was young,
Then I never would have mourned for my old true love,
Nor have courted no other one.",False True Love
Shirley Collins,"And after morning there comes an evening,
And after evening another day,
And after false love there comes a true love,
Come listen now to what I say.

My love he is a handsome young man,
As fair as any that the sun shone on,
But how to win him I do not know,
For now he has a sentence to be hung.

As he walked out through the streets of Derry
I'm sure he stood out right manfully;
He looked more like a commanding officer
Than a man to die upon the gallow's tree.

""Oh, where's my love, she's so long in coming,
And what detains her so long from me;
Perhaps she thinks it's a shame, a scandal
For a man to die upon the gallow's tree.""

He looked around and he saw her coming,
As she rode swifter than the wind;
She said, ""I'll show them that they cannot hang you,
And I'll crown my love with a bunch of green.""",The Streets of Derry

Like a honey comb,

See the ensign down, [Repeat: x2]

Shirley Collins,"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those, who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but then again no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody, this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you, that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten, if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen",Young John [*]
Shirley Eikhard,"I remember when we were kids
Takin' chances, all the crazy things we did
We'd race our bikes beside the railroad tracks
And chase that train like it was never comin' back

Well I'm still chasin' that train
Still chasin' that train...

One by one, my friends all settled down
Raisin' families with a house in town
And though they laugh when we recall old times
They look at me with disbelieving eyes

Cause I'm still chasin' that train...
Well, who'd have guessed that I would play this part
Nothin's cured me of a restless heart
Forever runnin' in the rain
Still chasin' that train

Twenty years have disappeared somehow
The tracks are overgrown and rusted now
But in my mind I still can hear the wail
And in my heart I know when all else fails

I will be still chasin' that train

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

What was I to say?
What can you say
When a love affair is over?

And I'm alone

Shared the body and bouquet
We'll taste the wine another day

Who knows where one starts, one ends
Tracing lights through sleepless nights
That I'll remember always and always

Long goodbyes and tearful looks
Hold up well in poems and books
But you and I have life to hold
The greatest story never told

How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

Shirley Horn,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so

Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

Shirley Horn,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
Shirley Horn,"In the dark, in the dark, just you and I
Not one sound, not one sigh
Just the beat of my poor heart in the dark

In the dark, in the dark, I get such a thrill
When he presses his fingertips upon my lips
And he begs me to please be still in the dark

Soon, this dance will be endin'
And you're gonna be missed
Gee, but I'm not pretendin'
But I swear it's fun, it's fun to be kissed

In the dark, in the dark we're gonna find
What the rest have left behind
We're gonna dance, we're gonna find romance in the dark
Just let them dance, we're gonna find romance in the dark

Shirley Horn,"Once I had a man, sweet as he could be
Once I had a man and he was right for me
Kind of curly hair, eyes so soft and true
That you couldn't help but care
When he looked at you
He called me baby
Baby all the time

He said, ""Baby can't you see?""
""Baby understand?""
""Baby you're for me""
""Oh won't you take my hand?""
But I push him away
Wouldn't let him near
Pushed him far away
And now I'm wishing I could hear him

Lonely through the night
Lonely, lonely hours without that

Keep him close to you so he'll come back to me
And call me baby, baby all the time
Baby, baby all the time","Baby, Baby All the Time"

Thou givest fever when we kisseth

Fever, yea I burn forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him

Oh daddy, won't you treat him right

A time for rainbow coloured weather

You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable

Che il cuore mio vorrebbe cancellar

Che splendidi tramonti dipingeva

Nearer than the wind is to the willow
Dearer than the rain is to the Earth below

You’re nearer than the ivy to the wall is

You’re nearer for I love you so

Leave me but when you’re away, you’ll know
You’re nearer for I love you so

Shirley Horn,"It's not that easy being green
Having to spend each day the colour of the leaves
When I think it could be nicer being red or yellow or gold
Or something much more colourful like that

It's not that easy being green
It seems to blend in with so many other ordinary things
And people tend to pass you over
'Cause you're not standing out like flashy sparkles on the water
Or stars in the sky

But green is the colour of spring
And green can be cool and friendly-like
And green can be big like an ocean or important like a mountain
Or tall like a tree

But if green is all there is to be
It could make you wonder why, but why wonder, why wonder
I'm green and it'll do fine
And it's beautiful and I think it's what I want to be.",Being Green

I stay away, but every day
I'm just foolin myself

Tell my friends that I don't care
I shrug my shoulders at the whole affair
But all know it isn't so
I'm just foolin myself

And every time I pass
And see my face in a looking glass
I tip my hat and say
""How do you do, you fool
You're trowing your life away""

I'm acting proud
And every time I see you in a crowd

Shirley Horn,"In old Savannah, I said Savannah,
The weather there is nice and warm!
The climates of a southern brand,
But here's what I don't understand:
They got a gal there, a pretty gal there,
Who's colder than an arctic storm,
Got a heart just like a stone,
Even ice men leave her alone!

They call her hard hearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah,
The meanest gal in town;
Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher,
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer!
To tease 'em, and thrill 'em, to torture and kill 'em,
Is her delight, they say,
I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan,
There was Hannah pouring water on a drowning man!
She's hard hearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah!

They call her hard hearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah,
The meanest gal in town;
Talk of your cold, refrigeratin' mamas,
Brother, she's a polar bear's pajamas!
To tease 'em, and thrill 'em, to torture and kill 'em,
Is her delight, they say,
An evening spent with Hannah sittin' on your knees,
Is like travelin' through Alaska in your bvds.
She's hard hearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah!

Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah
She's got the right name, the vamp of Savannah
Any time a woman can take a great big pan
And start pouring water on a drownin' man
She's hard hearted Hannah

For whom they were made
The rules of the road

You follow that kiss
And recklessly miss
A bend of the road
Then suddenly this
The end of the road

So love is a hoax
A glittering string
Of little white lies
But these are the jokes
And what if they bring
The tears to your eyes

Well love often shows a funny return
The brighter it glows
The longer you burn
And Lord only knows
Love has little concern
For the fools of the road

That's how it goes
You live and you learn
The rules of the road

Well love often shows a funny return
The brighter it glows
The longer you burn
And Lord only knows
Love has little concern
For the fools of the road

Shirley Horn,"I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darlin' can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darlin' can't you please see through me
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine

So I say merely,

For you, for me, forever more

With a world of love in store

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

Shirley Jones,"I recall the mad delight of a lovely dance
And a strolling through the night trembling with romance
There he told me of my charms, how could I resist

But to me was a thrill supreme.

The awaking of love's young dream.

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,

In a world of untrue love
Then you came along
Led, led, led, led, led me home
Then you brought me through
Now I found my way

Then you came along and led me home
First I doubted you
Then you brought me through
And now I've found my way

Now I wanna thank the Lord
Cause you came into my life
And now I've found my way",Found My Way
Shirley Murdock,"Sitting here
With pen and paper in my hand
And I try to write the words
But will you understand?

I wanted to call you on the telephone
But I thought it would be wrong
I had to tell you just how I felt
So I wrote this little song

I still love you (I still love ya)
I really do
I still love you (I still love ya)
I really do
I still love you (I still love ya)
I really do
I love you (love you)
Love you
I do

Since you been gone
There hasn't been anyone
To take your place
You brought joy to my heart
And a smile upon my face

All that's left, is the memory of you
The love that we shared
And the things we used to do

But I (I still love ya)
I really do
I still love you (I still love ya)
I really do
I still love you (I still love ya)
I really do
I love you (Love you)
Love you
I do

I can't seem to lose this hold over me
Now you know what I'm talkin' bout
And what is the remedy
We went our separate ways
Leading different lives
There's me myself and I
There's you and your new wife

Oh I love you (I still love ya)
I really do
I still love you (I still love ya)
I really do
I still love you (I still love ya)
I really do
I love you (Love you)
Love you
I do

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm not trying to interfere or cause you any strain
'Cause I know what I like and I like what I love
But I know that things have changed
Have changed

I still love you (I still love ya)
I really do
I still love you (I still love ya)
I really do
I still love you (I still love ya)

Shirley Murdock,"I can tell it's real
That glow I feel
Not like it was before I know
You make happiness abound

You have brought me a true love
Like never before
And if you will just let me
I'll spend my whole life with you

Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Just spend my, spend my life with you, baby)

If have such a blessed day
To have you in my life
I have in life one desire
That desire is to make you my wife

Words could not express it
No, no, not this
I guess I better prepare
To spend my whole life with you

Ooh, ooh, ooh

If I live forever
I will still need some more time
To let you know just what I feel
That time here forever ain't quite enough

Still I need to express it
This love I feel for you
I guess the best that I can do
Is spend my whole life with you

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Ooh
Hoo, hoo, hoo
I, baby
I want to spend my whole life with you

Shirley Murdock,"Living wasn't easy
'Cause we didn't have much money
But I knew I would make it someday
They told me I was nothing
That I'd never be something
But I knew I would make it someday

This is my story, I was a girl who
Came from nothing & life in my surroundings
Was bad. but deep inside me
I would pray for god to guide me
'Cause I knew he'd give me strength for life
And all it's problems back then.

Hand me down clothing 
Empty shelves inside the cupboard
And mama kept three jobs to make do
I'd hear her cryin'
But she never stopped between
Three girls, light bill and the rent ya'll
Livin' wasn't easy back then

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
By faith I believed one day I'd
Sing and things would get better
So don't give up no matter what it seems

Maybe the reason I'm feeling this way
Has something to do with you!

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

Broken, beaten, sick at heart

We've played the game of stay away

It's just a pose, I'm not that way,

Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,

So squeeze me but please don't tease me
 
Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues away each day
Counting the rights and waiting for you 
I'm in the mood to let you know 
I never knew I loved you so 
Please say you love me too 
When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me but please don't tease me

What's to become of it, this love of mine?

Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

You ought to learn your alphabet!""
So in my soup I used to get
All the letters of the alphabet
I learned them all from A to Z
And now my Mother's giving me

Animal crackers in my soup
Monkeys and rabbits loop the loop
Gosh, oh gee! but I have fun
Swallowing animals one by one

In every bowl of soup I see
Lions and tigers watching me
I make 'em jump right through a hoop
Those animal crackers in my soup

When I get hold of the big bad wolf
I just push him under to drown
Then I bite him in a million bits
And I gobble him right down!

When they're inside me where it's dark
I walk around like Noah's Ark
I stuff my tummy like a goop
With animal crackers in my soup!

Animal crackers in my soup
Do funny things to me
They make me think my neighborhood
Is a big menagerie

For instance, there's our Janitor
His name is Mr. Klein
And when he hollers at us kids
He reminds me of a lion

The grocer is so big and fat
He has a big mustache
He looks just like a walrus
Just before he takes a splash!",Animal Crackers in My Soup

I'll talk with queens and dance with kings like a little princess would;
If I could only do these things, I promise I'll be good.

Like the picture that I saw in a pretty story book;
A laur little girls were standing there much tinier than me
And they all carried baskets, they looked happy as can be,
Every one was smiling and having lots of fun;
I wish that I could be like that when I am twenty-one.

When I get very very old I'll stay at home all day,
But I haven't quite made up my mind,-- it's much too far away.
I think that I would like to be like the lady on the wall,
She looks so nice and comfy in her rocking chair 'n' all.
With that little cap upon her head she looks real pretty, too,

Tastes like pumpkin pie
When I'm with you
Oooh oooh oooh oooh!
In every dream I caress you
Every night I play the Lord will bless you
The worlds a nursry rhyme,
Daddy dear when I'm with you.
Every street I walk on 
Becomes a lovers lane
When I'm with you
I can see the sun
Though we're out in the rain
When I'm with you
To lose you would be tragic
Here is my heart unfurled
You have that certain magic
You're the seven wonders of the world
Snow is on the ground
But the leaves are in the trees
When I'm with you
Flowers sing a love song
There's music in the breeze
When I'm with you
Hmmmmmm
Please let me make this confession
You are my magnificent obsession
The world is all in rhyme
Lovely one when I'm
With you.",When I'm With You
Shirley Temple,"Believe me, if all those endearing young charms, 
Which I gaze on so fondly today
Were to change by tomorrow,
And fleet in my arms

Like fairy gifts fading away,
Thou wouldst still be adored,
As this moment thou art,
Let thy loveliness fade as it will;

And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart 
Would entwine itself verdantly still!","Believe Me, If All Those Endearing Young Charms"
Shirley Temple,"Just picture me without you
and you without me
Just close your eyes and you'll see
How lonesome we'd be. 

Skies would fall,
stars would all tumble
Life would be out of turn,
dreams would soon crumble. 

There'd be no me without you,
no you without me,
And yet nobody could be
As happy as we. 

Smiling through,
always together,
I can't picture me without you. 

",Picture Me Without You [From Dimples]
Shirley Temple,"Have you seen my new shoes
They are made out of wood,
Such nice little shoes,
Don't you think they look good?
I can dance all around
With the greatest of ease
I jump from the ground
To the tops of the trees.

I'll tell you something
I'm going to try
Put on your shoes 
And away we'll fly,
We'll take a trip
Where ever we choose,
We'll dance and skip
In our little wooden shoes.

How many miles will you travel with me,
One mile or two miles or may be three.
We'll make a stop where ever we choose,
We'll skip and hop 
In our little wooden shoes.


",In Our Little Wooden Shoes [From Heidi]
Shirley Temple,"I was born in a small town
But I'm livin' in a big town
They gave me a top hat and cane
In trade for a shady lane
Well, I'll give you back your big town
If you'll give me back a small town
Keep your top hats and canes
Give me those prairies and plains

If I had one wish to make
This is the wish I would choose
I'd want an old straw hat
A suit of overalls
And a worn out pair of shoes

Just let me roam around
Laughing at big city blues
With an old straw hat
A suit of overalls
And a worn out pair of shoes

Ho hum
Goin' fishin'
Hope you get a bite

Howdy Mister Jones
Ho hum
How's about a hay ride
Saturday night?

Sing: ""Heigh ho,
The merrio""
What have you got
What have you got to lose?

Get an old straw hat
A suit of overalls
And a worn out, musty
Rusty, dusty
Pair of shoes",An Old Straw Hat [From Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

What if the lights go out
And maybe and then the wind just starts to moan
Outside the door he followed me home

So goodnight moon
I want the sun
If it's not here soon
I might be done
No it won't be too soon 'til I say goodnight moon


There's a shark in the pool
And a witch in the tree
A crazy old neighbor and he's been watching me
And there's footsteps loud and strong coming down the hall

There's a big black crow sitting on my window ledge

Your voice can take me there, just like a prayer","John, 2/14"
Shivaree,"Looks like somebody got murdered
That's the way it looks around here

Too much of your thunder
Killed all my wonder for you

Me in my water-stained room
Alone with my ends and adds
Associating with the gods on my walls
While you fear up portraits
And forward all my calls to the moon

Looks like some nasty weather
Blew into the neighborhood
Funny it was so blue
I guess it followed you

And see how it goes
At your own private beach that fills up with a hose

Got a fifty foot trailer
And we're painting it red
With a cowboy, a sailor, and a canopy bed
No mother, no jailer
And they're keeping me fed
At the Reseda Casino and Bar

Well they're wet and they're shaking
Haven't had a bite
In a bit of a jam

Had the windows broken out last night

You can keep your illusions
And borrow my clothes
In total seclusion

And furrowed her brow

The subtleties a spectrograph would miss

And then announce her decision
While demanding her reward

Now we checked out this duck quack
Who laid a big egg, oh so black
It shone just like gold

And then the kids from the city
Finding it pretty, took it home
And there it was sold

It was changing hands for weeks 'till someone left it by their fire
It melted to a puddle on the floor

For it was only a candle

Shame, shame on you
Took my heart as a token
When returned, it was broken
Hide your face, shame on you

Shame, shame on you
Oh, shame, shame on you
Ran around with other guys
Tried to lie when I got wise
Foolish boy, shame on you

Shame, shame on you
Shame, shame, shame on you
Can you hold your head up high
Look your friends right in the eye?
No, you can't, shame on you

Shivaree,"Would you lay with me in a field of stone?
If my needs were strong, would you lay with me?
Should my lips go dry, would you wet them, dear
In the midnight hour if my lips go dry?

Would you run away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
And wipe the blood away from my dying hand
If I give myself to you?

Will you lay with me in the stream of life?
When the moon is full, will you lay with me?
Will you love me now when I’m down and out?
In my time of trial will you stand by me?

Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
And wipe the blood away from my dying hand
If I give myself to you?

Would you lay with me in a field of stone?
If my needs were strong, would you lay with me?

Shivers,"I used to laugh like a bastard
Now those days are long gone
I used to piss myself with my silly songs
I used to take long walks on beaches
And dream into the ocean
Now all my dreams seem out of reach
And I just haven't got the notion

Honey girl when you look at me
With your big brown eyes
My heart sinks to my belly
And I forget all those things I despise

Oh, on my street 
All the albino children
You know I'd like being naked
If I wasn't so thin

Oh in dreams
Colored roses
Heart-filled poses
Of guise

You were Jesus

Freckles of God
On your arm

Little old blue jay
Whistle me something I'd like to hear

I'm opening up my door
I'm letting down my guard
Honey, I'll let you love me
But it's gonna be hard
But ain't that what we're here for
It's like I've always known
It's magical to think about

Sho,"Yeah! This one goin' out to all the hustlers out there...
Runnin' that shit back and forth, handlin' their business... 
Do what it takes to make it...Me and willie d about to 
take a trip to mississippi on your ass...Check it out!

Mississippi here I come with three keys
My boys in the car full of fire arms
I gotta make that drop
I gotta outer-state plates so the cops are real hot
I'm off on no vacation
I'm not supposed to leave the state because I'm on probation
I need a driver but who can I trust?
Not Greyhound they got norks on the bus
I need somebody with some balls who won't slip
Because I'm payin' 900 for this big trip
Got my boys and everything's on so far
Need a fiend with a creditcard
To rip the call, gave the fiend the 8
He was sold, loaded up the ride
Now it's time to hit the road
But here comes the tough part
I got a road to Louisiana, the dopeman's graveyard
So I stopped poppin' no dopes
Roadin' through hell I can't afford to have my eyes close
Now I'm gettin' paranoid, spotted new folks
And they was comin' up real hard so I had to play it cool
Put on my seat belt and waved at them damn fools
Lifted my seat back putted on my locs
And told the driver don't stop till you get around some black folks
Back in road, I got somethin' to eat
Down me a forty and got right back in the streets
Drove for a while, now we finally here
Took me a shower, fresh clothes, now I need a bed
Made a call to make sure that the drop was right
Cause I don't transact no dope at night
I kinda thought somethin' was wrong
Cause the fool I was callin' he haven't his ass at home
But hell I let it pass
I left him message and told to get back real fast
See, my boys want some brew and some butt
After all this drivin' Sho had to bust a nut
Waxed the ass then I watched some TV, gee
I got a call around three
I set the drop off to twelve noon
I did the freak again and put her straight out of my room
Up the next morning, paid for the rooms we had
Loaded up my nine and rolled to the fool path
Got to his cribI told my boys:
""Don't kill him low! Give him the dope!
 Collect my money! We gonna hit the road!""
Put the dope on the table, started countin' my money
But somethin' was wrong, I'm feelin' kinda funny
Like this clown was starvin' for time
The whole whileI had my hand on the crome-plated nine
Yeah, I think it's time for Sho to leave
I took one step and heard: ""Freeze! Don't breath!""
And out of the blue comes the things my mother said:
""I be in jail! All this dope would have me dead!""
I can still see my baby mama on the floor
On her hands and knees beggin' me not to go
Had my mind on the grip
Could paid any hustler in the hood to take the trip
Didn't want to spend that extra paper
Bein' greedy got me gaught up in this caper
Now i'm face-down for the second time
Damn! I should had followed my first mind
Because now I'm in the cell where i'm gonna die
And Mississippi they get two years for P.I.
And the judge won't set a bail
I'm gaught up in this trap, the redneck hell
It had to be a set-up, see
Because the snitch I dropped the dope to was runnin' around town free
While his bosses still stairin' me
But sits won't last
Because when I get out here I'm a bust a cap in his punk ass
And till then I gotta stair these walls
Cause my moms phone don't except collect calls
County jumpers and some slippers
I'm stucked no luck 
I should known from the start it was a set-up...",Mississippi
Sho,"(Willie D)
Yeah, this goes out to all you humps out there
That think you are better cause you got the cashmere sweater
Stop look and listen
Pay close attention
While my road dog Sho tell ya how it G-O

(Sho)
Lord have mercy, anotha day anotha dollar
So many bills and problems, it make me want to holla
But thinkin bout the easy way out
Puttin a gun in my hand, let my brains hang out
But then I'd leave my mama with the bills to pay
And that's suicide, I'll go to hell anyway
Life ain't gettin no cheaper
And every single day I'm fallin deeper and deeper
Been thinkin about a jack
But it ain't enough for the rent
Plus my family is starvin, black
You see I'm runnin outta options
And every single day there's somethin new to stop me
And how I'm gonna face my family, dude
When they countin on me to bring home the food
The future don't bring no hope
I been worried about my bills
I ain't have time to vote
And if I did Mr.President wouldn't understand
Life in the ghetto
I'm the trouble man

(Willie D)
What ya know about the trouble man
You ain't never struggled so how can you understand
Got your big car and your big house and your big money
So you lookin at the trouble man funny
He's gettin dissed by society
When all he's doin is tryin to make ends meet
So when you see the trouble man don't frown
Cause what goes around comes around 

(Sho)
Come take a trip to the hood
Everybody knows I'm up to no good
Tryin to make them licks so I can pay them woods
Don't live my life on the rose
The only come up was to slang a lil' dope
But now I'm standin at the pen, G
They tryna lock me up 
Cause Uncle Sam couldn't tax me
My bills are due yesterday
And to make it worse I got a little baby on the way
But who really cares about my songs
I won't have lights if I'm broke when I come home
Been starrin life's mirror for directions
But I'm so broke I don't cast the reflection
Times are gettin so tough
If I had a few bucks I'd buy a 1/5 and a ice cup
And hang on the cuts with the rest of my friends with no plans
I'm the trouble man 

(Chorus)
I'm just the trouble man
I'm just the trouble man
Lord knows I'm doin the very very very best I can

(Sho)
Sometimes I don't want to see the next day
God knows a brother shouldna live this way
But I ain't the type that's sittin in the crib and chill
Sittin on my ass ain't gon pay my life bill
I'd rather be locked up for tryin than sittin in my crib
with no food watchin mama cryin
I'm always gonna do my part 
Straight outta South Park where the hustlers got heart
Just beein black is a punch in the stomach 
But beein black with no money is like my mind playin tricks on me
Everyday I'm out there duckin and divin
If you ain't livin how you want to
Then you just survive
Everybody think they got the plan 
But everywhere I go I see another trouble man
So on the dope game they wishin and hopin
But you got just as many slangin as you got out there smokin 
So I'm on to a new thang 
Rap music 
The brand new dope game

(Chorus)
(Sho)
I'm the trouble

(Chorus)
(Sho)
I'm the trouble

(Chorus)
(Sho)
I'm the trouble

(Chorus)

I'm the trouble",Trouble Man

Far from drunk but what's in my cup is only for the heads in the room that's 30 and up

Only thing I'm afraid of is God and my ego
Following false heroes, giving my vote to Nero

Excellent like the peace that came with Mandela out the prison
Excellent it's knowing I'm not defined by the wealth and stuff
Get the rich, line 'em up, they'll tell you money is not enough
Forgive us Lord 'cause we want love without truth
The world is spiritually poor 'cause we want heaven without you
It's malpractice, we want healing without patience
We don't want a heart transplant, we want facelifts
I was poetic so they forgave my poor ethics
A misogynistic skeptic with methods of good aesthetics
I was so dirty, unworthy and insufficient
I don't worry, he loves me when when I'm inconsistent
Commitment greater than talent, service over status
Passion over tactics, I don't drive your bandwagon
I keep grinding until they name a climate after me
Until it's common knowledge you jokers shouldn't be rhyming after me
I'm wired to be inspired by the lovers and the haters
I take it to different levels like I'm rapping on elevators
If you reaching for the top you better learn to survive
You can either fall or fly when you reaching for the sky
Fly excellent
Or fall excellent
But never quit
Never quit","Excellent, 2017"

How do you spell dad?
It goes L-O-V-E
How do you spell dad?
It goes L-O-V-E

Son in the land of the passive make sure that you man up
When introduced to a lady its always proper to stand up
Never talk behind the back of someone you're not a fan of
Know when the cops approach you, you might have to put your hands up
Respect all people and show honor to the king
No matter what they think the Lord created all human beings
Be critical, but never partner with defiance
Be happy with who you are all alone in the silence
Pray without ceasing, but keep your eyes on the system
Always speak up for the weak until somebody listens
Don't marry her if you don't plan to bury her
If you sweep her off her feet then learn how to carry her

Through thick and thin you know we gon' hold it down
Through good or bad you know we gon' stick around

Baby girl make sure your kings a better man than me
You better believe I know that may be hard to achieve
You're beautiful, I will always remind you
Never let the culture's idea of beauty define you
Baby girl don't be easily impressed
Stay clothed in righteousness cause it's harder to undress
I'm tryna raise the next Lena Horne
Fannie Lou Hamer a lady who can bring reform
Be wise and strong
Don't be a side chick for the ride along
Always be humble whether right or wrong
And know I'll be here when your friends are gone
When your friends are gone

If you want love, get love
If you need love, spread love

Yeah, I got new goals its family business I handle now
The kind of stuff that brothers over thirty be bragging 'bout
Tell my son that he's more than some target practice
Tell my daughter that she's more than an extension to a mattress
Never reach a goal by pulling others down
Royalty is much more than a throne and a crown
Your knees should be hurt from praying with your people
Your shirt'll be wet from crying over evil
I learned that love ain't based on performance
Make a mistake and I will love you in the morning
I see life in my children's eyes
And when I'm wrong I'll be the first to apologize
Peace to all my fathers who are working through their flaws
Fulfilling their duties and they don't do it for applause
It's true, any fool with a tool can reproduce
But a father is that dude that'll see it through
Forget the stereotypes lets be clear
There are good men out there we are here

Through thick and thin you know we gon' hold it down
Through good or bad you know we gon' stick around

Don't close the book, I got more to write

Don't close the book, I got more to write

You just saw the cover, but there's more to life

Yeah, hello
Quick introduction before I narrate
I'm from the west, between Cornel and Kanye
I grew up between section eight and cloud nine
During my youth I lost my sense of being colorblind
In between white supremacy and black nihilism
AME churches, corner stores and the prison systems
Hoteps and preachers on the block, they was dropping wisdom
I would pick it up and just give it a little rhythm
They said my lineage had a couple of kings
A couple queens, a couple thieves, a couple fiends
Despite the struggle, I was teached that we are equal
I fall short like a midget but I'm down for the people
The people, argue I died with integration
Their false liberation is really assimilation
The youth view my history with some suspicion
They wanna progress past religion and tradition

Don't close the book, I got more to write
You can change the story, that is my advice
I read in color, they see black and white
You just saw the cover, but there's more to life
Don't close the book, I got more to write
You can change the story, that is my advice

You just saw the cover, but there's more to life

Hello average, let me introduce you to awesome
That Harlem renaissance age had some excellent artists
That miseducation, that midnight marauding
That life before Eve ate that fruit in the garden
They say 'You might be on the wrong side of history'
Well, that depends on who's writing
Who's reciting, who's typing and who likes it
If we want peace somebody has to do the fighting
We exit Egypt, happy to speak resistance
Then turn around, and ask pharaoh for his assistance
Huh, what is logic to the ignorant?
What's forgiveness to people who think they're sinless?
We are those, fully exposed, Adam and Eve hiding our weakness
Folks who wanna be close but the devil stands between us
Who knows the dirty souls with an urgent need to be cleaned up
They oppose my solution, everybody hates Jesus

Don't close the book, I got more to write
You can change the story, that is my advice
I read in color, they see black and white
You just saw the cover, but there's more to life
Don't close the book, I got more to write

Yeah, was protesting a law?
Should I pray or should I write?
Do I want peace, or do I want power so I can try it?
Who's gonna give the truth when these church moms retire?
When censorship gets you fired and nobody gets inspired
I don't care what you look like, black, white or magenta
I don't care where you come from, Africa or placenta
We all desperate and broken, given the same dilemma
Do I serve God, or do I make off in my agenda?
I remember thinking I was Daniel with the lions
I'm like Israel in hiding when it's time to fight Goliath
I've been broken, I've seen death working
I've fought doubt, I've been knocked out, I know what hurt is
I run from the truth, but I know where church is
I failed doing my job but yet I know my purpose
Praise Jesus I was blind but now I see
But my problem is I think I see too many things

Let us chiropractic crack open the spine of this book
Turn a few pages and take a deep look
This is not the Catcher in the Rye
This is the African who caught the slave catcher's eye
Yet an invisible man who has the whole world watching
Shall we meet the protagonist?
For I am the colored cog in the capitalist wheel
With baby faced bronze skin and melon and a peel snatched from the craterless civilization
My name is Louis Portier
Arrived on these shores but I've got more to say
From Bali to Barbados to Beaufort, South Carolina
Sierra Leone to Sapelo
Sugar cane on my fingertips and shackles on my feet
There are limitations to a man so pity me until I sunk my tooth into Jude's freedom
Tastes like grandma's sweet potato pie
But it goes from master's plantation to mass incarceration
As the Jim Crow flies, all of this happened, more on less
This is up from slavery, meets Porgy and Bess
August Wilson, and Kenya Barris
James Brown and James Burr
Kehinde Wiley, and Cara Walker
George Carrothers, Clinton and Washington
Carver, the great migration and reconstruction
From black wall streets, to Harlem Artilliers
This is black survival and success, put on full display
Whether it's the Little Rock, or the Charleston Nine
Trying to integrate, or praying to stay alive
Thinking that if my work was good somehow y'all would recognize my personhood
But nah, instead I had to hustle this chocolate charm
This black brilliance, this ebony ingenuity
I know what this nation has done, can do, and is doing to me
Also what it could be and therefore still, I rise
From 1619 and beyond here I stand
From being three-fifths of a compromised plan
Using the breath in my black lungs
Shouting words from a place of black love
'I am a man'","Foreward, 1619"
Sho Baraka,"Drums make the folks go dumb
And make the folks go dumb
Horns make the people turn up
Yeah it make the people turn up
Turn up, turn up

Church keys make the church folks sing
Church folks sing, church folks sing

Love over hate, love over hate
I'm here for that
Real over fake, real over fake
I'm here for that
Truth and faith, truth and faith
I'm here for that
Beauty and grace, beauty and grace
I'm here for that
If you're here for the love, if you're here for the love, for the love (can the church say amen?)
If you're here for the love, if you're here for the love, for the love (amen, amen)

Yeah
What up Sho?
Just like old times, right?
Look, I'm here for the young'uns with they pants saggin'
And homies is flaggin, some say 'What up 'cause?' or 'What's bracking?''
Nothin' lacking on the corner, bread stacking
Pray to God that nobody have to toe tag 'em
He ain't be trapping in a minute
Use the re-up money for the tithes and the rent
Told his baby momma that he love her any minute
Pastor dipped him in that water after he repented
Granny told him he don't need a souvenir in church
Straight up out the street, think he made the deacons nervous
We just tryna learn a word and keep from getting murdered
We be on that Kirk and Kendrick Sunday after service
You can call it worship, Tamir Rice done got us nervous
Innocent and killed like Christ is how they hurt us
But I'm here for that
Probably ain't gonna get a lot of cheers for that

I just do it for the love, I do it for the love (I do it)
I do it for the broke and the poor, those all feel ignored
I'm here for that
Tell 'em we woke and we alert now
I promise there's healing for your hurt now

For my sisters who be fighting for that justice, uh, I'm here for that
Real fathers, loving on they wives and kids, I'm here for that
My wife is classy but a little ratchet, yeah I'm here for that
West coast feeling but I still live in the A homeboy, I'm here for that
When I walk on the courthouse judge feel the case out, definitely here for that
Y'know when that unexpected check comes in the mail, 'cause, I'm here for that
Always here for that
Uh, always I'm here for that
Gotta love it, gotta love it, gotta love it, gotta love it

It means to be broadened, y'know, beyond the understanding that black women are strong
Body and souls and so we're not only strong, we are, we are helpers
We are lovers, we are fighters, y'know, we, we love strong
But we are also human, y'know that mean's we are vulnerable
Y'know we are, we hurt, y'know we ache, like everybody else
We need somebody, to, to be strong for us when we are taking the bumps
The bruises we're here on the frontlines, fighting so many battles 
That many people are not privy to and so I think that
So y'know we are sisters, we are aunts, y'know we are deaconesses
We are leaders in our churches, y'know, we are speakers
We are writers, y'know we are corporate, y'know, CEO board executives
We are advocates, we need our brothers to stand up and defend black womanhood
Don't silence us, y'know, be happy that we are here to enable you, to empower you
But we also need that empowerment to go both ways","Here, 2016"

You better watch your mouth
I'd rather pray for forgiveness for what might come out
Lord, have mercy on the words I speak

But when they share their hate it's called scholarship

Try to be so gifted, to those typos go swipe on your image
Get a filter for that [?]
It's a privilege in fact
That's like, Stop asking me about the lack of female rappers
You rappers ain't even ready for what's gone happen after
We busy being mothers while you chasing platforms
You fat for them you living backwards
No wonder why you salty

Is this Rap or a cry for help?
Because many times, I think that I confuse myself
I'm just small time, but some think I can change rap
They think I'm BET They me to bring the game back
They like Sho, you inspire so many folk
But what is it all for when you're creative and broke
I know, I know, money don't solve problems but
Influence don't stop Sallie Mae from calling
It's enough to drive a brother to depression
I'm rich in spirit but my pocket's in recession
This is [?], I'm only telling you how I feel
Only fake people gotta remind you they keep it real (I keep it real)
I'm fighting my pride trying to be the nice guy
But my Michael Jackson's just trying to see the bright side
My white friends think I'm all about black power
My black friends living in ebony towers

Sho Baraka,"What if we took what James did on ""If It Wasn't For Love"" 
And we just flipped it like

Let's go
You more precious than a diamond, girl, I see you shine
I ain't insecure, girl, I know you mine
You ain't Oakland, girl, but I call you my ""bae""
When silence is violence, you know what to say
I'm eyeing you (I mean, I mean) you and I
I know it's hard to stay grounded when you know you fly
We can take this to the floor and we can groove
I ain't got nothing to prove, I'll just leave that up to you
Translate your body language every time you move
Even in a crowded room, it's just me and you
We can build a future, build dreams, build children
Man, forget these other women, you Number One in the building

If it wasn't for love, where would I be?
Let me tell you 'bout love, it'll set you free
Unconditional love, that's what I need
And if it wasn't for love, where would I be?
Ooh, my lady, you got me going crazy
You got me going crazy, baby
Yeah, if it wasn't for love

""Let the track breathe real quick

Moesha, she just made me a believer
Ring on her finger, she know I will never leave her

You got me going crazy, baby
Yeah, if it wasn't for love

Alright, now, look here, baby girl
You fine and I know you think that I'm fine
It don't make no sense why we can't be fine together
I mean, let's do the math
One plus one equals two, me and you
Ya dig? Know'm sayin'?
Uh, because if you do that math wrong, you gon' end up with a zero

Sho Baraka,"Are we sinners in the hands of an angry God?
Or is God being judged by a sinning mob?
If God ain't good, I must've missed something
If God ain't good, I must've missed something
He been good to me
You been good to me
Are we made in the image of God?
Or is it God that's mimicking us?
If I'm what's good, I must've missed something
If I'm what's good, I must've missed something
He been good to me
He been good to me

I used to be scared of the Holy Ghost
Now I'm just scared of them holy folks
Should we disagree with God or should we change Him?
If I'm made in His image, then why do we feel like strangers?
Is He a battery that's charged by my faith?
Who's at fault when I race but then I fall on my face?
Is God to blame for our intentions?
Like scientists didn't bless the world with eugenics
Like media ain't teachin' a new religion
Every time I watch the news, I'm gettin' a baptism
Should I prophesy or should I proselytize?
Is it culture engagement or compromise?
When I keep the doors closed, I'm gettin' ostracized
But when I open up the doors, I'm gettin' colonized
Everything is straight when you have no moral compass
Everything is new when you thinkin' like Christopher Columbus
Is everything just a social construct?
Who's allowed to judge our moral conduct?
I was an insecure boy who just thought he was a genius
But always pissed off, that's because I thought with my penis
It's all strategic, I'm just asking us the reason
Share my faith on the track, I'm just exorcising demons
Yeah, never told a lie
Uh uh, never told a lie

Are we sinners in the hands of an angry God?

Okay, let me preach

The rich man wants more
The poor man wants your's
The oppressed want a peace of mind
The thief want a piece of mine
The doubter needs a little faith
It ain't cliché to say ""let us pray""
Who gon' call the fouls if everyone balls out?
So open-minded that your brain falls out
G.K. said it best, nothing fails like success
And being consumed with it is much worse than death
They killin' you with money, they just bought your silence
You can't worship in a land full of pirates
The more booty, I promise the more scary
Success can be a drag, you can ask Tyler Perry
We sell sex then get mad that we have rapists
We promote greed then get mad that we have haters
I hated the police until a brother got robbed
I hated welfare until a brother lost his job
When I'm at work, I watch my pockets for them corporate thugs
When I'm at home, I watch my back for those crips and bloods
If my words bring conviction, let's call in context
I'm realizin' life is pretty complex
Thoughts of abortion taught me sanctity of life
A divorced man and woman taught me how to love my wife
A poor man sat me down and taught me about dignity
A blind man's vision taught me all about imagery
It'll leave you broke, that's why it's called the record industry
I forgot who I am, trying to get them to remember me
We adapt and evolve, the problems just revolve
Industry creates the very problems that they try to solve
I know I trace my image way back to the beginning
We done lost so much, we don't know when we winning
I'm hated, I'm loved, I'm both, I'm a challenge
I'm clean, I'm redeemed, I'm a recovering addict
I have baggage, I am damaged, I am unequally balanced
I'm a servant, but I have a room in the palace
Uh, never told a lie
Uh, never told a lie

He been good to me
He been good to me
Alright, let me preach

When I think of the goodness and all He has done for me
My soul cries out ""Hallelujah!""","Piano Break, 33 A.D."
Sho Baraka,"Ya'll ready? Ok, Marty, we ready!
Let's put it in the red

I lost it, I lost it a long time ago
I died already, I got one life to go
Executives, they put us on the shelf, they say we counterfeit
I got the answers but they don't know what the problem is
I fight the power but they want me to dance
I do the right thing cause I ain't Rosie Perez
I'm praying ""Lord, can you change my position?""
As if my position can make for an easy mission
I get possessions, they tell me to set 'em free
I cancelled, does that mean my possessions they own me?
I don't wanna be pop, I don't wanna be Pac
I wanna be a activist, but I don't wanna get shot
People think that I'm so brave, I'm so afraid
I get lost in my own head, I'm so amazed
You could choose to be the book or either read about it
You could speak about it, be a prophet or just be a product

A silver tongue, gold pockets
Fat belly, stolen wallets
Empty words, loaned knowledge
I'm undervalued but I can be a prophet
I'm undervalued but I can be a prophet
I'm undervalued but I can be a prophet
I'm undervalued but I can be a prophet
I lose money every time I'm honest

Help me find it, I think I'm losing my religion
Help me find it, I think I'm losing my religion
I think they moved the finish line, I'm losing my position
Devil wanna buy my soul, I tell him I'm too expensive
My man say he don't live like an angel much
Except for when he's high off that angel dust
Dude said that the church is full of hypocrites
I told him find somebody outside the church who was innocent
They only throw stones at trees that bear fruits
So don't be shocked when the mob attempts to throw stones at you
The ancestors told us we should wake up
And when I stop dreaming, failure, we gon' break up
Some dream of a Aston Martin
I dream of Angela and Martin in the morning marchin'
Bringing hope to the homeless, the widows, and the orphans
I'm prayin' for revival, tell James to bring his organ

A silver tongue, gold pockets
Fat belly, stolen wallets
Empty words, loaned knowledge
I'm undervalued but I can be a prophet
I'm undervalued but I can be a prophet
I'm undervalued but I can be a prophet
I'm undervalued but I can be a prophet
I lose money every time I'm honest

The shadows try to taunt me
They hopin' I fall
But I shall not fall
And I will not fall

You can offer me money
You can offer me gold
You can't have my crown
You can't have my soul
You can't have my soul
You can't have my soul

I'm groovin' for the activists and graduates
I'm an advocate for those feeling abandonment
In the favelas and slums, the ghetto inhabitants
It's like 'Can anything good come outta Nazareth?'
The only thing good came outta Nazareth
(This is the groove, tell me, can you handle it?)
Yeah I'm schooled in the ways of runaway slaves
I'm brave, I'm unchained, I'm Frederick Douglass with a fade
I kidnapped greatness and left no ransom
I'm the grandson of Muhammed Ali, but more handsome
The solar cat call away with our dancing
Call me Eve before I show my fruit, let me get at 'em
Picking up the pieces in a world that's fallen
They imprisoned by ignorance, I'm begging your pardon
I'm charming, I am George Washington Carver in a garden
With some food, but some prefer starving

The industry is Walmart, they missing the target

I'm grooving for a Coltrane and Athanasius
Bonhoeffer and Harlem
Now, you speaking my language
I'm contagious, educated and dangerous
(I've been running for my life but I don't know where the race is)
If you've never seen a frown you'll never love a smile
Only insecure boys, they fighting for a crown
You never been a servant, then you'll never be a king
Woke up in two thousand and fifteen like you've never had a dream
Bad schools, bad food, bad predatory lenders
Bad debt, no investment, just mandatory spenders
On spinners, on spinners, need something on spinners
Churches ain't saving they just decorating sinners
When the liquor store is your neighbour, they'll probably grow up a drunk
When the courts keep you from court you'll probably learn to dunk

Sho Baraka,"Yeah, maybe words don't say much
Maybe we don't need words to communicate our love
Maybe

All I wanted a perfect life
Some perfect kids and a perfect wife
Some perfect days and some perfect nights
Even though I'm flawed, I should be alright
A child with special needs didn't fit in my plans
I'm a needy man, wanting more that what you put in his hands
All I wanted was a perfect family core
Now I'm envying the family next door
Trying not to trust therapy more than God
I am walking the street where fear and love collide
I am learning in weakness, you still gotta serve
And my connection with my boys is way deeper than words
But damn, words, I thrive with 'em
Words are my life, my career, I survive with 'em
I'm given a life sentence that words can't fix
Now we both live in a world that don't make sense

Yeah maybe words don't say much
Maybe we don't need words to communicate our love

My sons are not a punishment or an accident
Just a little abstract masterpiece of what the master did
I try not to doubt the power of prayer
But sometimes, I just feel like the power ain't there
Some days I'm feeling good, some days I'm feeling torn
I'm getting praise for activities a father should perform
I get applause when I excel, thank you
Is there grace for me when I fail and I'm feeling shameful

Yeah, well maybe words don't say much
Maybe we don't need words to communicate our love

My father said he needed greater trust in the Lord
And the Lord used cancer so he could trust in Him more
He died without complaining, that's when I understood
He taught me more in his silence, that a sermon ever could
Words can be lies to help us disguise our phoniness
Feeling insecure, in the midst of pride and loneliness
I learned the meaning of contentment really fast
Wanting change, while appreciating everything that you have

Yeah maybe words don't say much
Maybe we don't need words to communicate our love
Maybe words don't say much
Maybe I should just learn to shut up

Only you know
Only you know
Oh oh oh
Only you know
Only you know
Oh oh oh

Truth is your presence speaks much louder than when a choir sings
I never knew I'll find joy up in the smallest things
The counsellor said ""Live long, love strong, stick together""
This is a thorny rose you two will carry forever
Find value in your interactions, and not in your treasure
Find strength in Jesus, increase your faith in good measure
Avoid evil, your kids need a home that is peaceful
Don't be a passive man, understand that your family needs you
Pray for healing, hoping they find a cause
But after all, I resolved, you are not a problem to solve
Maybe I wouldn't change you
Maybe I'm just unable to see your potential
Because I'm blinded by the labels

Yeah maybe words don't say much
Maybe we don't need words to communicate our love
Maybe words don't say much

There was a time when I adored you
But I was too blind in love to see
That it wasn't we it was only me

I'm loving you but my heart can't pretend
When your feelings just haven't been there
So if you want to go I won't follow you
I guess I'm not the one to make your dreams come true
If you want my love I got to let you go
Cause your loving is the deepest hurt of all

Where was the life we had before
There was a place in your heart I could call home
Now I find my place has gone to somebody else
I let you go cause I can't take no more
I'm loving you but my heart can't pretend
When your feelings just haven't been there

So if you want to go I won't follow you
I guess I'm not the one to make your dreams come true
If you want my love I got to let you go

If I could find a way to turn back time
I would make it so that every day in every way you still could be mine

But the park was closed, we walked away. 
We brought many things to eat.
Fruits and soda, even meat.
But we have to wait. 

We were told the park was beautiful.
We were told the park was so nice. 

Someday we'll go back again.
We'll have a party, please bring your friends. 

We'll have lots of things to eat.
Fruits and soda, even meat.
We'll have a party then.",Expo '90
Shonen Knife,"There's a big bird named Toucan Sam
With a pretty colored beak just like a candy cane
I wonder if he'd be so nice (be so nice)
As to take us to Fruit Loop Paradise

Chocolate streams and ice cream dreams
Fancy flavored clouds and sun
Lots of cake and soda pop
And lollipops for everyone

I wish I was like Toucan Sam
I could fly to the rainbow and candy land
Take all my friends to a tasty place (tasty place)
Get a beak and go flying in outer space

Shonen Knife,"If you had the luck of the Irish
You'd be sorry and wish you were dead
You should have the luck of the Irish
And you'd wish you was English instead

A thousand years of torture and hunger
Drove the people away from their land
A land full of beauty and wonder
Was raped by the British brigands
Goddamn goddamn

If you could keep voices like flowers
There'd be shamrock all over the world
If you could drink dreams like Irish streams
Then the world would be high as the mountain of morn

In the 'Pool they told us the story
How the English divided the land
Of the pain and the death and the glory

And the poets of old Ireland

If we could make chains with the morning dew
The world would be like Galway Bay
Let's walk over rainbows like leprechauns
The world would be one big Blarney stone

Why the fuck are the English there anyway?
As they kill with God on their side
Blame it all on the kids and the I-R-A
As the bastards commit genocide
Aye, genocide

If you had the luck of the Irish
You'd be sorry and wish you were dead
You should have the luck of the Irish
Wish, you'd wish you was English instead
Yes, you'd wish you was English instead",The Luck of the Irish

I have been to Hong Kong one time
Everywhere in the world is good
But Osaka is the best town
My favorite town Osaka
I have been to Tokyo one time
I have been to Nagoya one time
Everywhere in Japan is good
But Osaka is the best town

Shonen Knife,"If the rain comes they run 
And hide their heads.
They might as well be dead.
If the rain comes, if the rain comes.

When the sun shines they slip into the shade.
(When the sun shines down).
And drink their lemonade.
(When the sun shines down).
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.

Rain, I don't mind.
Shine, the weather's fine.

I can show you that when it starts to rain.
(When the rain comes down).
Everything's the same.
(When the rain comes down).
I can show you, I can show you.

Rain, I don't mind.
Shine, the weather's fine.

Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines.
(When it rains and shines).
It's just a state of mind?
(When it rains and shines).
Can you hear me, can you hear me?",Rain
