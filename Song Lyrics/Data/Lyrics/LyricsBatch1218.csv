I see the flash - then I hear the thunder
So shocked - I'm merely a shell

Throws a shadow on my dreams.

Through the labyrinth of time?
And I'm still waitin' for the good Lord
To show me the way, babe.

Will my reckless courage invite you
To become my clever companion?
Madly in love and in love with the madness,
Get ready to run baby.

I walked 47 miles on barbed-wire,
Cobra-snake for a necktie.
Built a house by the roadside,
Made of rattlesnake hide.

Brand new chimney up on top,
Made out of human skulls.
Come on baby take a walk with me,
Tell me who do you love?

Who do you love, now?
Who do you love, now?
Who do you love, babe?
I say: Who now, who do you love?

Tombstone head and a graveyard mind,
Just 22 and I don't mind dying.
Rode around the town with a rattlesnake whip,
Come on baby don't give me no lip.

Who do you love, now?
Who do you love?
Who do you love, child?
I said: Who, baby, who do you love?

Night is dark, the sky was blue,
Down the alley the ice wagon flew.
Hit a bump, somebody screamed,
Should'a heard just what I seen.

Do you love me, babe?
Do you love her, yeah

Do you love it, yeah

The Doors,"All right

Wild child full of grace
Savior of the human race
Your cool face

Natural child, terrible child
Not your mother's or your father's child
Your our child, screamin' wild

An ancient rulage of grains
And the trees of the night
Ha, ha, ha, ha

With hunger at her heels
Freedom in her eyes
She dances on her knees
Pirate prince at her side
Stirrin' into a hollow idols eyes

Wild child full of grace

Your cool face

The Doors,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go

There's only one thing you should know

Like that night in spain

Wonder does she grieve

'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""

Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss

Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye

How do I survive each day
Livin' ghetto life
Twist me up a fat ass J
And livin' indo high

Life in the ghetto
Far from little China
It's a place where the police is always down to find ya
'Cause everybody in the momma snitches
Brothers and niggaz, and sisters that's called bitches
Damn! the same people that holler out ""peace, brotha""
Will try to catch with the draws so they can fuck ya
Black folks in the ghetto straight fuckin up
And the whites on the outside bustin up
Time to bust a cap in the chevrelo
Whether you'z a nigga, a nigga, a negro
If you're not a sollution you'z a problem
Nine double one ain't be the only way to solve 'em
'cause it's oughter to cheese them crackers
First you pimps gotta work with the jackers
And both of y'all must work with the gangs and dope-dealers
'cause they'z the main motherfuckers killers
Until then the ounces from the white devil
And what's left for the blacks
Life in the ghetto (in the ghetto)
If it's lit take a hit and it's on

Now all through high school I relied on drug-smugglin
'Cause I was broke, a nigga was straight strugglin
Not knowin where my next dollars comin from
But I got a gun there's the double up I'mma jack one
How I'mma let the fool be up when I'm on the bottom
Anytime you broke a lot of friends you ain't got 'em
To be a young man you got to be ready
'Cause in my house there was no fuckin daddy
In the home, I roam with the homies from the block
Experiencing, puberty, clockin do' and passin glocks
I remember at the party the ho's didn't like me
'Cause when the party was over I rolled out on my Nike's
When times get rough and tough
I'm gon grab that bud and take a superpuff
Indo high, I replied on the bud for the pain
And stayin leveled to the ground and true to the game
You can't jump on my escalator if you ain't need it
I'd rather pull a lick and stay weeded
? into the alley
Smooth but fast now I'm headed to the shack
To count yo cash
If it's lit take a hit and it's on

And it's on
And it's on
And it's on
And it's on
And it's on
And it's on

Every since we put it down
niggaz want to come around
down to the shack
since we aren't fuckin wack
but they best a back up and get back in the cut
'cause when I think back to the days, they didn't give a fuck
now niggaz want to come around and clown in my face
but lookin over yesteryear, they wasn't in the place that I was in

Funny, funny, funny style ass niggaz
want to kick it with the Knight but I squeeze the trigger
(boom boom) why? because I check you busta niggaz
niggaz, they want to come around
now that I made it, niggaz hate it
but they can't fade it
jealousy, dwells in the mind
but my time is still 9-4
as I display rhymes like this
MCs I diss, 'cause I cut ups upon the track
MCs they come one and all and all in one
but you see niggy Knight man's definitely got the gun (revolver)
but now you want to bust raps with me
clock snaps with me, and adapts with me
but I ain't havin it, I'm rollin with my nigga Scoop and Bo
and shit we got the flow and here we fuckin go
so, niggaz best a recognize this fuckin crew called the Dove Shack
as you see skills we never lack

Is with a stranger who I never met

When you're so far away

You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me,
But that you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended
To be feeling similarly
And led you to believe it was o.k
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

Well I guess I'm trying to be
Nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove
I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath a disguise of a smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel
And I lie convincingly
Cause I don't want to reveal
The fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise
Till I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I break down and cry

So what do you do
When somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing ""I will survive""
Do you lash out and say ""How dare you leave this way?""
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away

Yeah, c'mon, yeah, c'mon, c'mon

Slamming doors darling to me it's just a drag
But it's all because 
I Can't Get Over You
I tired and I tired
Oh I just can't get you off my mind
This feeling I have for you 
Is strong indeed with a flame I can't put out
I tired to do without you and fine someone new, someone new
You found yourself a new love 
And it's driving me sane
Oh
I Can't Get Over You
Oh baby
I tired and tired, oh..... I just can't get you off of my mind
Your love, your love, your love means more to me then life itself
And without you I can't go on

To pick up the pieces no matter how hard
It seems that you were made for me baby 
And no matter how I try 
I can't, I can't, I can't

Sound of the city on slow decay
See the faces behind private eyes

In the humdrum,

There's a foreman standing on a bridge of iron
And the men walk across it to go back to work
In their monday morning shirts
And they don't run

But he would wander from time to time
Seeking guidance from the Holy he tried to find the truth

Who canonized his youth
And gathering strength from the feeling that
To believe could undoubtable change the world

Turned his back on education
And listened to the word
So with little or no formal education
He taught himself to work

Would often steal the pain it took
To rise up from the dirt
And out of desperation would
Disturb the millionaires

Whose patronage had helped the power
Rise up from thin air,
Then he sunk back into despair

'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away

You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care

I've wasted my nights,
You turned out the lights

But even the sun sets in paradise

Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button

Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin'

Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take
that little piece of shit with you

We were like children posing
Playing at games, acting out names
Guessing the parts we played

Oh what a hit we made
We came on next to closing

Love left the masquerade

Fate seemed to pull the strings
I turned and you were gone

That music box played on

Song of my heart's composing

The Dresden Dolls,"I've tried dolls that were guaranteed sixteen or under none were very exciting
Sorta like a laugh track or whacking off they'll get you off but it's just not the real thing
Its been decades since my pit days
But I haven't shaken it - I sit there like an idiot
Still caught up in the old punk protocol
And dreaming that the teenagers will think that I'm a radical

and I still wait for the bus to come where the high school got torn down
Still expecting to find true love among the skateboarders hanging out
In back of the bank in my hometown

all this talk and no action's got me stiff from the tit to the bone
So I'm living in lala land - but at least I'm not living at home
Same old catcalls, the same old chemicals
Same old thrills stealing stockings from the shopping mall
Its simple enough to grow the fuck up happy with the rough cut
Nobodys in here looking for a diamond in the rough but

I still wait for my mom to come and pick me up at holly's house
10 years after they cashed it in to make a multi-level parking lot for a seven-eleven and burger king

I've got cryptographs I've got all the phones tapped
It's proof enough it is indisputable
Love's not good enough I want photographs
Something that will teach me my arithmetic at last..

better get your kids in - I'm on the loose again
And getting more ridiculous the more I think I ought to get my mind out of the gutter
(it's getting dangerous, amanda-you are old enough to be the pork)
He's my own private highway from the cradle to the grave
I save a bundle skipping middle age and saturdays

and I still wait for the cops to come where the station since burned down
Still expecting they'll pick me up for all the sins I committed in the back of the banged-up pickup truck

I've got autographs, backstage passes and leather jacket back patches up the...
Ask me anything I've got evidence
Single serving saccharine packets dripping black with lipstick kisses

I still wait for the bus to come back where the high school got torn down
Still expecting to find true love among the sakteboarders hanging out
In back of the bank in my home-

I'm no pederast just out of interes
Thank you ,but I'm capable of getting up and getting dressed
Love's not good enough I want photographs
Something that will teach me common sense
Time and time again
I think ill dye my hair again
Oh god

No, I'm ten
I'm seventeen

The Dresden Dolls,"Clutching the phone till my hands were sore
I never understood pain before, Christopher
You cannot know what it does to me
Hearing you speak with this frequency

I never knew what one voice could do
I was in heaven the moment I heard you
My friends go out drinking and having fun -
I stay in bed with my headphones on

Shot down with arrows from waves above
Christopher Lydon renounced my love

It took so long to get through to you
I never understood sorrow, and now I do
I finally got past your moniter,
You broke my heart in two, Chrisopher

Christopher, I was your listener, Christopher,
I've never felt love like this before, Christopher,
Christopher, now and forevermore, Chrisopher
I'll never stop saying Christopher, Christopher

Finally I knew what I had to do
I had to make the connection with you
I don't care if your old and incontinent
I will be yours til the bitter end...

So during a show about Joan of Arc
I got through and said:
""Christopher Lydon, you've stolen my heart""
When I asked if you felt the same way for me
You cut me off like a guillotine

Drawn like a bull to a matador-
I just see visions of Chrisopher
Shot down by arrows from waves above
Christopher Lydon renounced my love

Christopher, I was your prisoner, Christopher,
I hope you're happy now, Chistopher
Thank you for everything, but I'm not listening anymore nor do I plan to contribute to NPR

I'm the girl you've been waiting for

The Dresden Dolls,"No one's asking to go dancing its not like that anymore
Its romantic if they mean it when they shut your fingers in the door
Its a gory sort of story that's been told a hundred times before
It gets tricky don't be picky if the slipper fits you wear it whore


How many tips can I take home tonight without them getting mad
How many stitches do you think it takes to fix a cut that bad
How many minutes until midnight and you get your eyesight back

not to knock it I've been off it never moving very much at once
Its been awkward I still offer it when its that time of
Other girls shower but I give out flowers
To curious strangers who throw dollars at my feet

how many crimes can I try spotting dry before it leaves a stain
How many times say that I love you til it doesn't mean a thing
How many fittings must I sit through with my big feet blistering
How many times until it strips me and my big mouth strikes again

I'm not asking to go dancing I'm not that dumb anymore
Its exhausting to keep smiling when your toes are bleeding on the floor
Its a gory sort of story that's been told a hundred times before
Don't be sorry just ignore me because honestly
I'm too sore from fitting exactly to ride into setting suns aching to
Stand on my own two feet

how many wishes do I still have left to fix the way it ends
How many princes do you think
It takes to put a girl like this back together again
How many instances can you point out where I was less than kind
How many happy endings do you need to change your fucking mind
And how much time do we have left before it's midnight and
You see that I was never the right size?





",Glass Slipper
The Dresden Dolls,"Thirty licks with a belt - same old tricks on myself
And I wonder does everyone else live this way
A succession of tests a triumphant success
Each time I'm still intact at the end of the day

thirty drops in a glass - keep my temper and pass
With my breath held you bastards you lucked out again!
Its not really so bad, there's still mom there's still
Damage to do before they wrest the axe from my hands

its no mystery: you should obviously go
Before I break everything
You're always telling me that you're dying to know
But you're not really listening

how do I manage to station myself in harms way
And only get hit with a ticket for loitering
That I have no way to pay - and no strength to argue
My personal demons can scheme with professional care
Oh, god, they're after me
If I could shut them out just for an second
I swear
I could stop this catastrophe

thirty day guarantee
But they can't have meant me
After all I was born to a childproof world
No sharp corners or glass,
Small objects or plastic bags
Please, these are death to a delicate girl

its no mystery - you should obviously know
That I'll destroy everything
So don't go telling me that you're dying to know
Cause you'll get what you're asking for

and I still manage to station my self in harm's way
And only get hit with a ticket for loitering
Stating I came the wrong day
Now all the demons are screaming their wages aren't fair
I've left a secret kept
If I could shut them up just for a second I swear
It'll look like an accident
I could be decent yet
The magnificent end
I could be president....





",Thirty Whacks
The Dresden Dolls,"The time has come to speak of many things
Of jacks and queens and kings

I bared my wrists and promised to begin
But you cut the blade straight in

try hard my love do you hear the distant strings
Please remember what this means

did I come back for all of this?
It seems absurd somehow...
With one well-placed flick of the wrist
You've really done it now...

(all of my blind ambition left me deaf with perfect vision)

the time has come
For things to come undone
That we should not have begun

at last I felt a numbness overcome
And now you turn and run...

the time has come
To take me in your arms and touch these fragile scars

you have the choice now so decide
If you want in or out
There is too much left for us to try
You can't just give up now

the time has come
To speak of many things
Of jacks and queens and kings

it took that cut to bring me back to life
They're bleeding, they're frightened but I hold out both my hands:
No one in the world will ever touch me there again.



",The Time Has Come
The Dresden Dolls,"I won't try to explain what I cannot understand
It's a bird it's a plane it's a one night stand
If I only we could ride far enough
I'd forget you altogether
It's a bluff
There is no way I could not remember

don't ask me what I came here for
It is too delicate for words
I used to want to make you talk
Now I would rather you did not

I don't mind if you read while I'm coming
It's alright if you need the t.v.
To keep from noticing my mind going blank
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Is my back all that bad?
Strike the match and watch the doll come open

don't ask me what I want from you
It is not something you could purposely do
I used to want to make you mine
Now I have better things in mind...

The Dresden Dolls,"Biting keeps your words at bay
Tending to the sores that stay
Happiness is just a gash away
When I open a familiar scar
Pain goes shooting like a star
Comfort hasn't failed to follow so far

And you might say it's self-indulgent
You might say its self-destructive
But, you see, it's more productive
Than if I were to be healthy

And pens and penknives take the blame
Crane my neck and scratch my name
But the ugly marks are worth the momentary gain
When I jab a sharpened object in
Choirs of angels seem to sing
Hymns of hate in memorandum

And you might say it's self-indulgent
And you might say it's self-destructive
But, you see, it's more productive
Than if I were to be happy

And sappy songs about sex and cheating
Bland accounts of two lovers meeting
Make me want to give mankind a beating

And you might say it's self-destructive
But, you see, I'd kick the bucket
Sixty times before I'd kick the habit

And as the skin rips off I cherish the revolting thought
That even if I quit there's not a chance in hell I'd stop
And anyone can see the signs, mittens in the summertime
Thank you for your pity, you are too kind

And you might say its self-inflicted
But you see that's contradictive
Why on earth would anyone practice self-destruction?

And pain opinions are sitcom feeding
They don't know that their minds are teething
Makes me want to give mankind a beating

I've tried bandages and sinking
I've tried gloves and even thinking
I've tried vaseline, I've tried everything

And no one cares if your back is bleeding
They're concerned with their hair receding
Looking back, it was all maltreating
Every thought that occurred misleading

Makes me want to give myself a beating

The Dresden Dolls,"So you don't wanna hear about my good song?
You don't wanna hear about how I am getting on
With all the things that I can get done
The sun is in the sky and I am by my lonesome

So you don't wanna hear about my good day?
You have better things to do than to hear me say
God, it's been a lovely day, everything's been going my way
I took out the trash today and I'm on fire

So you don't wanna hear about my good friends
You don't have the guts to take the truth or consequence
Success is in the eye of the beholder
And it's looking even better over your cold shoulder

I'm not suggesting you get to line me up for questioning
But Jesus think about the bridges you are burning and I'm betting
That even though you knew it from the start
You'd rather be a bitch than be an ordinary broken heart

So go ahead and talk about your bad day
I want all the details of the pain and misery
That you are inflicting on the others
I consider them my sisters and I want their numbers

God, it's been a lovely day, everything's been going my way
I took up croquet today, I'm on fire
I picked up the pieces of my broken ego
I have finally made my peace as far as you and me go

But I'd love to have you up to see the place
I'd like to do more than survive, I'd like to rub it in your face

Hey, it's been a lovely day, everything is going my way
I had so much fun today and I'm on fire
God, it's been a lovely day every thing's been going my way
Ever since you went away, hey, I'm on fire

I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on
I'm on fire, I'm on fire
I'm on fire, I'm on

The Dresden Dolls,"Gravity plays favorites I know it 'cause I saw
Honest to God, officer it's awful
Down at work I'm getting too familiar with the floor
Showing off my talents by the mouthful

Hate to break it to you but its out of my control
Forces go to work while we are sleeping
If I could attack with a more sensible approach
Obviously that's what I'd be doing

Now, necks are cracking sideways
Hit me from the back side
I am on the white side
You are on the black side

Cut a piece that's bite size
Shoot me from my good side
If you got a straight line
This would be a good time

Gravity works slowly if you notice it at all
Some of us are getting mighty lucky
If you had to live with this you'd rather lie than fall
You think I can't fly well you just watch me

Now, necks are cracking sideways
Hit me from the back side
I am on the thin side
You are on the fat side

Cut a piece that's bite size
Shoot me from my bad side

The Dresden Dolls,"Half underwater, I'm half my mother's daughter
A fraction's left up to dispute
The whole collection, half of the price they're asking
In the halfway house of ill repute

Half accidental, half painful instrumental
I have a lot to think about
You think they're joking? You have to go provoke him
I guess it's high time you found out

It's half biology and half corrective surgery gone wrong
You'll notice something funny if you hang around here for too
Long ago in some black hole before they had these pills to take it back
I'm half Jill and half Jack

Two halves are equal, a cross between two evils
It's not an enviable lot
But if you listen you'll learn to hear the difference
Between the halves and the half knots

When I let him, when I feel the stitches getting sicker
I try to wash him out but like they say, 'The blood is thicker'
I see my mother in my face but only when I travel
I run as fast as I can run but Jack comes tumbling after

And when I'm brave enough and find a clever way to kick him out
And I'm so high, not even you and all your love could bring me down
On 83rd he never found the magic words to change this fact
I'm half Jill and half Jack

I'm halfway home now, half hoping for a showdown
'Cause I'm not big enough to house this crowd
It might destroy me but I'd sacrifice my body
If it meant I'd get the Jack part out

See Jack, run Jack, run Jack, see Jack
See Jack, run Jack, run Jack, see Jack
See Jack, run Jack, run Jack, see Jack
See Jack, run Jack, run Jack, run Jack, run

The Dresden Dolls,"I've been driving around town
With my head spinning around
Everywhere I look, I see
Your '96 Jeep Cherokee

You're a bully and a clown
You made me cry and put me down
After all that I've been through
You think I'd hate the sight of you

But with every jeep I see
My broken heart still skips a beat
I guess it's just my stupid luck
That all of Boston drives the same black, fucking truck

It could be him or am I tripping
And I'm crashing into everything
And thinking about skipping town a while
Until these cars go out of style

I try to see it in reverse
It makes the situation hundreds of times worse
When I wonder if it makes you want to cry
Every time you see a light blue Volvo driving by

So don't tell me if you're off to see the world
I know you won't get very far
Don't tell me if you get another girl
Baby, just tell me if you get another car

It could be him or am I tripping
It could be him

The number of them is insane
Every exit's an ex-boyfriend memory lane
Every major street's a minor heart attack
I see a red jeep and I want to paint it black

It could be him or am I tripping
And I'm crashing into everything
I can't wait till you trade the damn thing in
By then they will have put me in the looney bin

It could be him my heart is pounding
It's just no use, I'm surrounded
But one day I'll steal your car and switch the gears
And drive that Cherokee straight off this trail of tears

Won't you miss me? Won't you miss me? Won't you miss me?

Missed me, missed me, now you've got to kiss me
If you kiss me, mister, take responsibility
I'm fragile, mister, just like any girl would be
And so misunderstood, so treat me delicately

Missed me, missed me, now you've gone and done it
Hope you're happy in the county penitentiary
It serves you right for kissing little girls
But I will visit, if you miss me, say you miss me

Do you miss me?
Will you kiss me through the window?
Do you miss me, miss me?
Will they ever let you go?

And a red little girl's at the top of a slide
And an orange old man at the bottom
Wants to take her for a ride

As she slips and she tumbles the orange man mumbles
Pennies crash down from the sky
And he tells her, he'll take her away where it's safe
And of course it is a lie

She's a third the down and her skirts are yanked up
And her little girl cheeks start to wrinkle
But her smile is wide and her legs are spread wider
Her hair growing long and her hips getting larger
Past getting brighter
Light growing weaker

She is halfway down now but the man is impatient
Shakes change in his pocket he might have to wait
But she's coming
She's coming
She's coming

Who are you blaming?
They're just playing
That's a good one, who left the playground
A good decade before the bell rang?

As she starts to draw nearer the view becomes clearer
The splinters are painful but she doesn't feel it
The pennies were loaded and as they exploded
She starts to spin out of control

Her eyes are now closing her sleeves are unrolling
Up past her head and her veins are all showing
Not that she noticed, she's thoroughly focused on
One old man who's laughing
Who's laughing
Who's laughing

Don't worry, I've got you
Don't worry, I've got you
Don't worry, I've got you
Don't worry, I've got you

You'll start to really show it in a week or so
So don't go saying it's just come to your attention
You'll get more than you're asking for without the right protection

Today's a very special day
And how you'd love to have a little thing with which to play
But love won't get you very far, today be still your beating heart
You'll have to keep on feeding it tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow

Boys will be boys, will be boys, will be boys, will be boys
Will be boys, will be girls with no warning
Girls will be girls, will be guys, will be boys that don't cry over toys
That they use to beat girls they despise by the morning
They always said that sex would change you
Change you, change you, change you

No second thoughts the knife is nearing
You'll never hear the little pitter patter pitter patter
Of this little feat of engineering
Of course I love you and of course it's what's inside that matters

But I think the whole charade is ending
It seems to me to be the only way to keep from getting
Caught up in a long life of regretting
The doctors say that once you get a taste for it should keep on cutting

But while you happen to be here
Why don't you whisper all those sweet forevers in my ear?
Stiff upper lip in all this sorrow, hurry up and stick it in
You never know when it will end tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow

They always said that sex would change you
Change you, change you, change you

The Dresden Dolls,"All the cities in the world
And so very little time and
So many different girls...
All you have to do is find them. 
There's a wealth of opportunity, you plan your trips accordingly. 
A pity, but the pretty ones are usually more touristy. 
Say, how'd you like to run away from these machines?
Everywhere the spies are printing out your dreams. 
Seven stops in seven different countries, 
Seven page itineraries, memories thick as Bloody Marys, Jesus, Joseph, bloody hell. 

Right now we're here in Boston, 
In love with downtown crossing. 
New York will be there in the morning. 
Come back to bed, my darling. 

Four years thrown away on vows we never kept. 
Forty-five minutes every day religiously devoted to regret. 
Time we could have spent on medication thrown away on education, 
And we planned to take a trip to Scotland but we never made it. 
How'd you like to run away from these machines?
I had Julian's and Steve's. 
You had Julia's and Jeanette's. 
You wear your terror on your sleeve for all the men I haven't met (yet). 
I had Oliver in Potsdam, you had Elanor in Amsterdam. 
We're keeping track so carefully we've missed the state we're in completely. 
Honestly, your foot is out the door and I've got scores of offers elsewhere and keep both feet planted firmly in the air, 
And tomorrow you can totally erase me from your mind, but trust me everything is fine, 
Because
Right now, we're here in Boston, 
In my apartment in the south end. 
Forget your year in London. 
Come back to bed, my darling. 

You can put the details in a letter, 
The more embarrassing the better. 
Right now I can be happy if I choose to. 
I know that in the morning I will lose you...

And maybe you'll go mad. 
And maybe I'll go gray 
And pack up to Berlin, 
Or maybe it won't matter anyway. 
We'll find out that your mom was right and you'll admit you're really gay. 
And maybe I'll wake up
In a city far away. 
Or maybe we'll make up
And buy a house and have a couple kids and a Labrador and a microwave. 
But anyway, 
Right now we're here in Boston. 
In Eden, where you almost pulled your pants down. 
Don't worry who these jokes will all be lost on. 
Come back to bed, my darling. 
There is nothing in the world that we can count on, 
Even that we will wake up is an assumption. 
But I know for a fact that I loved someone, 
And for a about a year he lived in Boston...",Boston
The Dresden Dolls,"Boys wear overcoats in heat like this to keep themselves from showing

So whats the use dear jenny anyway the world is pretty...

Ashley talks to astronauts back home by way of fax transmission
Andy gets a new tattoo each time he gets back bathroom privilege
Weary oh so drearily we wave our flags into the camera
Amber goes berserk completely she's been here since last December

Sad but true the truth can turn your smile to a frown
So whats the use dear jenny anyway the world is pretty
Upside-down...

The rates are better in the summer
Looks like dear jenny's doing better

Back at home the broadcast warning bounces off of an empty table
Jenny asks the astronauts to sleep with her behind the stable
Christmas hasn't been the same since dad put in the central heating
Checks you before bedtime with a battery to keep your new heart beating

And the world might turn a million times around before
They tell you jenny anyway the world is pretty world is pretty happy world is pretty happy

Sometimes they let strangers in and other times they check their records
When they check out in the morning dad puts out the lie detectors
Jenny prays to gods she've never heard of for a special warning
All the walls stay dead as Jenny's heart is
But shes still observing

Sad but true the high-gloss gloss paint wont tell you what to do
So whats the use dear jenny anyway

We will cram brambles in your bed

They hung two things before me
Oh the possibilities

A little global warming
Never hurt no one

You've always been a failure
But now you're bearing strange new fruit of hell

And watch the garden grow

The Dresden Dolls,"He told me that I knew what to laugh at
And I wanted to but I just couldn't ask if he would take it back so I could know for certain
So on the bench I watched his left hand crossing
While doubling entendres with the voicings
He said ""O darling, you're charming
Please don't find it alarming if I pull this stop out to free up a hand for heavy petting""

Now there there
I'm a friendly man
I joke about sex because it's funny when you're frightened

So silently I sat and turned the pages
Recalculating our respective ages
Over my shoulder, he muttered, ""If I get any older
You can hack my wrists off with your choice of objects
No, I'm kidding""

Don't be scared
I'm a friendly man
I joke about death because it's funny when you're frightened

This is as far as I could get
He jabbed a needle in my neck
Erasing all the evidence
But there were matchsticks in my pants
And if a rock should hit my head
And I remember what he did
You'll be the very first to know
Maybe I'll find out why this damn thing won't stop bleeding

He told me that I showed a great potential
That given I turned heads and pages
Fame would be a piece of cake
But practice was essential
So like a stupid child I believed it
And golly who would had agreed if
I had been Schubert or Mozart
Devoted to the fine art of perfecting absolutely everything inconsequential

Don't be sad
I'll come back again
I joke about trash 'cause it takes class to be enlightened

So several decades have gone by
I am still sitting by his side
I turn the pages faithfully

We're not giving up

Would you leave me alone with my tears?

Don't go (Please stay)
(Please stay)

 You took me away from the rest of the world
 When you taught me to love you like this
 Now I hang by a thread in the canyon of doom
 But I still can be saved.. by your kiss

If I got on my knees and I pleaded with you
Not to go but to stay in my are-arms
Would you walk out the door like you did once before?
Or would this time be different, would you sta-a-ay?

Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free

To the California sun

Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown

No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx

Eight miles high and falling fast

With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance

'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage

Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight

And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken

But I can't help but be confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?

Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah
I heard it through the grapevine 
I'm just about to love my mind
Honey, honey, yeah
I heard it through the grapevine,
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah",I Heard It Through the Grapevine
The Drummonds,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
The Drummonds,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go

High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland
The Drummonds,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

The Drummonds,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

If your heart is in your dream

All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

And let you know

And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be

The Dubliners,"BOULAVOGUE
(P.J.McCall)
At Boulavogue, as the sun was setting
O'er bright May meadows of Shelmalier,
A rebel hand set the heather blazing
And brought the neighbors from far and near.
Then Father Murphy, from old Kilcormack,
Spurred up the rocks with a warning cry;
""Arm! Arm!"" he cried, ""for I've come to lead you,
For Ireland's freedom we fight or die.""
He led us on 'gainst the coming soldiers,
The cowardly Yeomen we put to flight;
'Twas at the Harrow the boys of Wexford
Showed Bookey's regiment how men could fight.
Look out for hirelings, King George of England,
Search every kingdom where breathes a slave,
For Father Murphy of the County Wexford
Sweeps o'er the land like a mighty wave.
We took Camolin and Enniscorthy,
And Wexford storming drove out our foes;
'Twas at Slieve Coillte our pikes were reeking
With the crimson stream of the beaten yeos.
At Tubberneering and Ballyellis
Full many a Hessian lay in his gore;
Ah, Father Murphy, had aid come over,
The green flag floated from shore to shore!
At Vinegar Hill, o'er the pleasant Slaney,
Our heroes vainly stood back to back,
And the Yeos at Tullow took Father Murphy
And burned his body upon the rack.
God grant you glory, brave Father Murphy,
And open Heaven to all your men;
The cause that called you may call tomorrow
In another fight for the green again.

He'd a beautiful brogue so rich and sweet
To rise in the world, he carried a hod

With love for the liquor poor Tim was born
To help him on with his work each day
He'd a drop of the craythur every morn'

His head felt heavy which made him shake
Fell from a ladder and he broke his skull
They carried him home, his corpse to wake

Rolled him up in a nice clean sheet
And laid him out upon the bed
A gallon of whiskey at his feet
And a bottle of porter at his head

The Dubliners,"As down the glen one Easter morn
To a city fair rode I
There armed lines of marching men
In squadrons passed me by
No fife did hum, no battle drum
Did sound its dred tattoo
But the Angelus bells o'er the Liffey's swell
Rang out through the foggy dew

Right proudly high over Dublin town
They hung out the flag of war
'Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky
Than at Suvla or Sud el Bar
And from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's huns with theirlong-range guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew

'Twas Brittania bade our wild geese go
That small nations might be free
But their lonely graves are by Suvla's waves
On the shore of the gray North Sea
But had they died by Pearse's side
Or fought with Cathal Brugha
Their names we would keep where the Fenians sleep
'Neath the shroud of the foggy dew

But the bravest fell, and the requiem bell
Rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Eastertide
In the springing of the year
And the world did gaze in deep amaze
At those fearless men, but few
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the foggy dew",The Foggy Dew

She is a-courting one, two, three

The Dubliners,"In the County Tyrone, near the town of Dungannon, 
Where many the ructions meself had a hand in.
Bob Williamson lived, a weaver by trade, 
And all of us thought him a stout Orange blade, 
On the Twelfth of July as it yearly did come, 
Bob played with his flute to the sound of a drum.
You may talk of your harp, your piano or lute, 
But none can compare with the Old Orange Flute.

Bob, the deceiver, he took us all in; 
He married a Papist named Bridget McGinn.
Turned Papist himself and forsook the old cause
That gave us our freedom, religion and laws.
Now, boys of the townland made some noise upon it, 
And Bob had to fly to the province of Connaught.
He fled with his wife and his fixings to boot, 
And along with the latter his Old Orange Flute.

At the chapel on Sunday to atone for past deeds, 
He'd say Pater and Aves and counted his brown beads.
'Til after some time, at the priest's own desire
He went with that old flute to play in the choir.
He went with that old flute for to play for the Mass, 
But the instrument shivered and sighed, oh, alas, 
And try though he would, though it made a great noise, 
The flute would play only ""The Protestant Boys.""

Bob jumped and he stared and got in a flutter
And threw the old flute in the blessed holy water.
He thought that this charm would bring some other
Sound; 
When he tried it again, it played ""Croppies Lie Down.""
Now, for all he could whistle and finger and blow, 
To play Papish music he found it no go.
""Kick the Pope"" and ""The Boyne Water"" it freely would
Sound, 
But one Papish squeak in it couldn't be found.

At the council of priests that was held the next day
They decided to banish the old flute away.
They couldn't knock heresy out of it's head, 
So they bought Bob a new one to play in it's stead.
'Twas fastened and burned at the stake as a heretic.
As the flames soared around it, they heard a strange
Noise; 
'Twas the old flute still whistling ""The Protestant
Boys.""
""Toora lu, toora lay, 
Oh, it's six miles from Bangor to Donnahadee.""",The Old Orange Flute
The Dubliners,"Will you come to the bower o'er the free boundless ocean
Where stupendous waves roll in thundering motion
Where the mermaids are seen and the wild tempest gather
To loved Erin the green, the dear land of our fathers

Will you come, will you, will you, will you come to the bower

Will you come to the land of O'Neill and O'Donnell
Of Lord Lucan of old and the immortal O'Connell
Where Brian chased the Dane and St. Patrick the vermin
And whose valleys remain still most beautiful and
Charming

Will you come, will you, will you, will you come to the bower

Where Owen Roe met Munroe and his Chieftains did slaughter
Where the lambs skip and play on the mossy all over
From those bright golden views to enchanting Rostrevor

Will you come, will you, will you, will you come to the bower

You can see Dublin City and the fine groves of Blarney
The Bann, Boyne, the Pillar and the lakes of Killarney
You can ride on the tide on the broad majestic Shannon
You can sail round Lough Neagh and see storied
Dungannon

Will you come, will you, will you, will you come to the bower

You can visit New Ross, gallant Wexford and Gorey
Where the green was last seen by proud Saxon and Tory
Where the soil is sanctified by the blood of each true man
Where they died satisfied that their enemies they
Wouldn't run from

Will you come, will you, will you, will you come to the bower

Will you come and awake our dear land from its slumber
And her fetters we'll break, links that long have encumbered
And the air will resound with Hosannahs to greet you
On the shore will be found gallant Irishmen to greet you

Fine girl you are! Your`re the girl that I adore

And the sky it is so cloudy you can scarcely see the moon. 
And the good old ship, she was tossing about, 
The riggin`was all tore, and still I live with hopes to see, The Holy ground once more. 

And now the storm it is over and we are safe on shore, 
We will drink a toast to the Holy Ground and the girls that we adore. 
We will drink strong ale and porter and make the rafters roar, 
And when our money is all spent we`ll go to sea for more.",The Holy Ground

With their tickets at the station

And they off to see the races

With me wack fol the do fol

There were passengers from Limerick
And passengers from Nenagh

And the Clare unmarried maiden
There were people from Cork City
Who were loyal, true and faithful
Who brought home the Fenian prisoners
From dying in foreign nations

And the fiddlers competing
And the sporting wheel of fortune
And the four and twenty quarters
And there's others without scruple
Pelting wattles at poor Maggie
And her father well contented
And he gazing at his daughter

And it's there you'll see the jockeys
And they mounted on so stably
The pink, the blue, the orange, and green
The colors of our nation
The time it came for starting
All the horses seemed impatient
Their feet they hardly touched the ground
The speed was so amazing!

Into the army I did engage
I left my home with a good intent
For to join the forty-second regiment

While I was posted on guard one day
Some soldiers' children came out to play
From the officers' quarters my captain came
And he ordered me for to take their names

I took one name instead of three
On neglect of duty they then charged me
I was confined to barracks with loss of pay
For doing my duty the opposite way

A loaded rifle I did prepare
For to shoot my captain in the barracks square
It was my captain I meant to kill
But I shot my colonel against my will

At Liverpool Assizes my trial I stood
And I held my courage as best I could
Then the old judge said, Now, McCafferty
Go prepare your soul for eternity

I had no father to take my part
No loving mother to break her heart
I had one friend and a girl was she
Who'd lay down her life for McCafferty

And go treat your men with some decency
For it's only lies and a tyranny

He fell off the ladder and he broke his skull
And they carried him home his corpse to wake
Well they rolled him up in a nice clean sheet
And they laid him out upon the bed
With a bottle of whiskey at his feet
And a barrel of porter at his head

The Dubliners,"On Raglan Road on an autumn day
I saw her first and knew
That her dark hair would weave a snare
That I might one day rue

I saw the danger, yet I passed
Along the enchanted way
And I said, let grief be a falling leaf
At the dawning of the day

On Grafton Street in November
We tripped lightly along the ledge
Of a deep ravine where can be seen
The worth of passions pledged

The Queen of Hearts still making tarts
And I not making hay
Oh, I loved too much and by such, by such
Is happiness thrown away

I gave her gifts of the mind
I gave her the secret sign
That's known to the artists who have known
The true gods of sound and stone

And word and tint I did not stint
For I gave her poems to say
With her own name there and her own dark hair
Like clouds over fields of May

On a quiet street where old ghosts meet
I see her walking now
Away from me so hurriedly
My reason must allow

That I had loved not as I should

The Dubliners,"As I was a goin' over the far famed Kerry mountains
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier
Saying ""Stand and deliver"" for he were a bold deceiver

Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny

But the devil take the women for they never can be easy

Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o

I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder
But Jenny blew me charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter

Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

And 't was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken

Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

There's some take delight in the carriages a rolling
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
but I take delight in the juice of the barley
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early

There's whiskey in the jar

And if anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney
And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenney

The Dubliners,"Well, you've heard about the Indians with their tommy hawks and spears
And of the U.N. Warriors, the heroes of recent years
Also I might mention the British Grenadiers
Well, none of them were in it but the Dublin Fusiliers

You've heard about the Light Brigade and of the deeds they've done
And of the other regiments that many victories won
But the pride of all the armies, dragoons and Carabiniers
Was that noble band of warriors, the Dublin Fusiliers

[Incomprehensible] face, this is the way we go
Charging with fixed bayonets, the terror of every foe
A glory to old Ireland, as proud as Buccaneers
And a terror to creation are the Dublin Fusiliers

Well, you've heard about the wars between the Russians and the Brits
The Tsar one day was reading an old copy of ""Tidbits""
And when the General came to him and threw himself down in tears
""We'd better run back like blazes, here's the Dublin Fusiliers""

The Tsar commenced to tremble and he bit his under lip
""Begorra boys"" says he, ""I think we'd better take the tip""
The devils come from Dublin and to judge from what I hears
They're demons of militia men, the Dublin Fusiliers

[Incomprehensible] face this is the way we go
Charging with fixed bayonets, the terror of every foe
A glory to old Ireland, as proud as Buccaneers
And a terror to creation are the Dublin Fusiliers

Well, the sergeant cried, ""Get ready lads, lay down each sword and gun
Take off your shoes and stockings boys and when I tell yous, run""
They didn't stop but started and amidst three ringing cheers
Came a shower of bricks and bullets from the Dublin Fusiliers

The time that Julius Caesar tried to land down at Ringsend
The coastguards couldn't stop them, so for the Dublin's they did send
And just as they were landing, lads, we heard three ringing cheers
""Get back to Rome like blazes, here's the Dublin Fusiliers""

A glory to old Ireland, as proud as Buccaneers

The Dubliners,"Good evening, all my jolly lads, I'm glad to find you well
If you'll gather all around me, now, the story I will tell
For I've got a situation and begorrah and begob
I can whisper all the weekly wage of nineteen bob

'Tis twelve months come October since I left me native home
After helping them Killarney boys to bring the harvest down
But now I wear the gansey and around me waist a belt
I'm the gaffer of the squad that makes the hot asphalt

Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot asphalt

The other night a copper comes and he says to me, McGuire
Would you kindly let me light me pipe down at your boiler fire?
And he planks himself right down in front, with hobnails up, till late
And says I, me decent man, you'd better go and find your bait

He ups and yells, I'm down on you, I'm up to all yer pranks
Don't I know you for a traitor from the Tipperary ranks?
Boys, I hit straight from the shoulder and I gave him such a belt
That I knocked him into the boiler full of hot asphalt

Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot asphalt
 
We quickly dragged him out again and we threw him in the tub
And with soap and warm water we began to rub and scrub
But devil the thing, it hardened and it turned him hard as stone
And with every other rub, sure you could hear the copper groan

I'm thinking, says O'Reilly, that he's lookin' like old Nick
And burn me if I am not inclined to claim him with me pick
Now, says I, it would be easier to boil him till he melts
And to stir him nice and easy in the hot asphalt

Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot asphalt

You may talk about yer sailor lads, ballad singers and the rest
Your shoemakers and your tailors but we please the ladies best
The only ones who know the way their flinty hearts to melt
Are the lads around the boiler making hot asphalt

With rubbing and with scrubbing, sure I caught me death of cold
For scientific purposes, me body it was sold
In the Kelvin grove museum, me boys, I'm hangin' in me pelt
As a monument to the Irish, making hot asphalt

Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat

The Dubliners,"Eighteen sixty nine being the date anf the year,
Those Waterloo sportsmen and more did appear,
For to gain the great prizes and bear them awa',
Never counting on Ireland and Master McGrath.

On the twelfth of November, that day of renown,
McGrath and his keeper they left Lurgan town,
A gale in the Channel, it soon drove them o'er,
On the thirteenth they landed on England's fair shore.

Oh well when they arrived there in big London Town,
Those great English sportsmen all gathered around,
And one of those gentlemen standing nearby
said, 'Is that the great dog you call Master McGrath?'

Oh well one of the gentlemen standing around,
Says, 'I don't care a damn for your Irish greyhound!'
And another he sneered with a scornful 'Ha! Ha!
We'll soon humble the pride of your Master McGrath.'

Then Lord Lurgan came forward and said, 'Gentlemen,
If there's any amongst you has money to spend.
For your grand English nobles I don't care a straw,
Here's five thousand to one upon Master McGrath.'

Oh, McGrath he looked up and he wagged his old tail.
Informing his lordship, 'Sure I know what you mean,
Don't fear, noble Brownlow, don't fear them agra,
We'll soon tarnish their laurels', says Master McGrath.

Oh well Rose stood uncovered, the great English pride,
Her master and keeper were close by her side;
They let them away and the crowd cried, 'Hurrah!'
For the pride of all England and Master McGrath.

Oh well Rose and the Master they both ran along.
'I wonder', says Rose, 'what took you from your home.
You should have stayed there in your Irish domain,
And not come to gain laurels on Albion's plain.'

'Well, I know', says the Master, 'we have wild heather
bogs
but, bedad, in old Ireland there's good men and dogs.
Lead on, bold Britannia, give none of your jaw,
Stuff that up your nostrils', says Master McGrath.

He jumped on her back and held up his ould paw -

But a youth again I can never be
Till apples grow on an ivy tree 

I left me father, I left me mother
I left all my sisters and brothers too
I left all my friends and me own religion
I left them all for to follow you 

 But the sweetest apple is the soonest rotten
And the hottest love is the soonest cold
And what can't be cured love has to be endured love
And now I am bound for America 

Oh love is pleasin' and love is teasin'
And love is a pleasure when first it's new
But as it grows older sure the love grows colder
And it fades away like the morning dew 

And love and porter makes a young man older
And love and whiskey makes him old and grey
And what can't be cured love has to be endured love
And now I am bound for America

",Love Is Pleasing
The Dubliners,"As I went a walking one morning in May
I met a young couple so far did we stray
And one was a young maid so sweet and so fair
And the other was a soldier and a brave grenadier

And they kissed so sweet and comforting
As they clung to each other
They went arm in arm along the road
Like sister and brother

They went arm in arm along the road
'Til they came to a stream
And they both sat down together, love
To hear the nightingale sing

Out of his knapsack he took a fine fiddle
He played her such merry tunes that you ever did hear
He played her such merry tunes that the valley did ring
And softly cried the fair maid as the nightingale sings

And they kissed so sweet and comforting
As they clung to each other
They went arm in arm along the road
Like sister and brother

They went arm in arm along the road
'Til they came to a stream
And they both sat down together, love
To hear the nightingale sing

Oh, I'm off to India for seven long years
Drinking wines and strong whiskies instead of strong beer
And if ever I return again 'twill be in the spring
And we'll both sit down together love to hear the nightingale sing

And they kissed so sweet and comforting
As they clung to each other
They went arm in arm along the road
Like sister and brother

They went arm in arm along the road
Til they came to a stream
And they both sat down together, love
To hear the nightingale sing

""Well then"", says the fair maid, ""Will you marry me?""
""Oh no"", says the soldier, ""however can that be?""
For I've my own wife at home in my own country
And she is the finest little maid that you ever did see

And they kissed so sweet and comforting
As they clung to each other
They went arm in arm along the road
Like sister and brother

They went arm in arm along the road
'Til they came to a stream
And they both sat down together, love
To hear the nightingale sing

The Dubliners,"Let grasses grow and waters flow in a free and easy way
But give me enough of the rare old stuff that's brewed near Galway Bay
Come policemen all from Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim too
Oh, we'll give them the slip and we'll take a sip
Of the rare old Mountain Dew

Hi di-diddly-idle-um, diddly-doodle-idle-um, diddly-doo-ri-diddlum-deh
Hi di-diddly-idle-um, diddly-doodle-idle-um, diddly-doo-ri-diddlum-deh

At the foot of the hill there's a neat little still
Where the smoke curls up to the sky
By the smoke and the smell you can plainly tell
That there's poitin' brewin' nearby

For it fills the air with a perfume rare
And betwixt both me and you
As home we stroll, we can take a bowl
Or a bucket of the Mountain Dew

Hi di-diddly-idle-um, diddly-doodle-idle-um, diddly-doo-ri-diddlum-deh
Hi di-diddly-idle-um, diddly-doodle-idle-um, diddly-doo-ri-diddlum-deh

Now learned men who use the pen
Have sung the praises high
Of the rare poitin' from Ireland green
Distilled from wheat and rye

Put away with your pills, it'll cure all ills
Be ye Pagan, Christian or Jew
So take off your coat and grease your throat
With the dear old Mountain Dew

Hi di-diddly-idle-um, diddly-doodle-idle-um, diddly-doo-ri-diddlum-deh

The Dubliners,"You see they are working men 

[Chorus]
It's a working man I am and I've been down underground 
And I swear to God if I ever see the sun 
Over any length of time, I can hold it in my mind 
I never again will go down underground 

At the age of sixteen years, he quarreled with his peers 
And he swears there will never be another on 
In the dark recess of the mine, where you age before your time 
And the coal dust lies heavy on your lungs

At the age of sixty-four, 
If he lives that long, 
He'll greet you at the door 
And he'll gently lead you by the arm 
In the dark recess of the mine, 
He can take you back in time 
Tell you of the hardships that were there

The Dubliners,"'Twas down by the Glenside I met an old woman

I listened a while to the song she was humming

On strong manly force, their eyes with hope gleamin'
I see them again through all my sad dreamin'

The Dubliners,"It's of a gentlemen soldier as a sentry he did stand
He saluted the fair maid be a wavin' of the hand
So boldly then he kissed and he passed it off as a joke
He drilled her up in the sentry box, wrapped up a the
Soldiers coat
And the drums did go with a rat-ta-ta-tat and the fifes
Did loudly play,
Fare thee well Polly me dear I must be going away

All night they tossed and tumbled till daylight did
Appear
The soldier rose, put on his clothes, said fare thee
Well me dear
For the drums they are a pounding and the fifes did
Sweetly play
If it weren't for that dear Polly, then along with you
I'd stay
And the drums did go with a rat-ta-ta-tat and the fifes
Did loudly play,
Fare thee well Polly me dear I must be going away

Oh come you gentlemen soldier, ""Won't you marry me?""
""Oh no me dearest, Polly. Such things never can be.?
""I've a wife already and children I have three
Two wives are allowed in army but one is too many for
Me.?

The Dubliners,"As down the glen one Easter morn
To a city fair rode I
There armed lines of marching men
In squadrons passed me by
No fife did hum, no battle drum
Did sound its dred tattoo
But the Angelus bells o'er the Liffey's swell
Rang out through the foggy dew

Right proudly high over Dublin town
They hung out the flag of war
'Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky
Than at Suvla or Sud el Bar
And from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's huns with theirlong-range guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew

'Twas Brittania bade our wild geese go
That small nations might be free
But their lonely graves are by Suvla's waves
On the shore of the gray North Sea
But had they died by Pearse's side
Or fought with Cathal Brugha
Their names we would keep where the Fenians sleep
'Neath the shroud of the foggy dew

But the bravest fell, and the requiem bell
Rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Eastertide
In the springing of the year
And the world did gaze in deep amaze
At those fearless men, but few
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the foggy dew",The Foggy Dew [Live]
The Dubliners,"I remember the night that he came in from the wintery
Cold and damp
A giant of a man in an oilskin coat, and a bundle that
Told he was a tramp
He stood at the bar and he called a pint, then turned
And gazed at the fire
On a night like this, to be save and dry is my one and
Only desire

So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""

Then in a voice that was hushed and low he said
""Listen, I'll tell you a tale""
How a man of the sea became a man of the road and never
More will set sail
I fished out of Howth and Killybegs, Ardglass and
Baltimore
But the cruel sea has beat'n me and I'll end my days on
The shore

So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""

One fateful night in the wind and the rain we set sail
From Killybegs town
There were five of us from sweet Donegal and one from
County Down
We were fishermen who worked the sea and never counted
The cost
But I never thought 'ere that night was done, that my
Fine friends would all be lost

So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""

Then the storm it broke and drove the boat, to the
Rocks about ten miles from shore
As we fought the tide, we hoped inside to see our homes
Once more
Then we struck a rock and holed the bow and all of us
Knew that she'd go down
So we jumped right into the icy sea and prayed to God
We wouldn't drown

But the ragin' sea was risin' still as we struck out
For the land
And she fought with all her cruelty to claim that
Gallant band
By Saint John's point in the early dawn I dragged
Myself on the shore
And I cursed the sea for what she'd done and vowed to
Sail her never more

So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""

Ever since that night I've been on the road, travelin'
And tryin' to forget
That awful night I lost all my friends, I see their
Faces yet
And often at night when the sea is high and the rain is
Tearing at my skin
I hear the cries of drowning men, floating over on the
Wind

So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
""Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here""

So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'

And smiling with his eyes

The Dubliners,"I danced in the morning
When the world was begun,
And I danced in the moon
And the stars and the sun,
And I came down from heaven
And I danced on the earth,
At Bethlehem
I had my birth. 

Dance, then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he,
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said he

I danced for the scribe
And the pharisee,
But they would not dance 
And they wouldn't follow me.
I danced for the fishermen,
For James and John 
They came with me
And the Dance went on.


Dance, then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he,
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said he

I danced on the Sabbath
And I cured the lame;
The holy people
Said it was a shame.
They whipped and they stripped
And they hung me on high,
And they left me there
On a Cross to die.

Dance, then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he,
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said he

When the sky turned black 
It's hard to dance
With the devil on your back.
They buried my body
And they thought I'd gone,
But I am the Dance,
And I still go on.

I am the Lord of the Dance, said he,
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the Dance, said he

And I leapt up high;
I am the life
That'll never, never die;
I'll live in you
If you'll live in me -

We set sail from the fair Cobh of Cork
We were bound far away with a cargo of bricks
For the fine city hall of New York

In a very fine craft, she was rigged fore-and-aft
And oh, how the wild winds drove her
She had twenty-three masts and withstood several blasts
And we called her the Irish Rover

There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
And a chap called McGurk who was scared stiff of work
And a chap from West Meade called Malone

There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
And fighting Bill Casey from Dover
There was Dooley from Claire who was strong as a bear
And was skipper of the Irish Rover

We had one million bales of old billy goats' tails
We had two million buckets of stones
We had three million sides of old blind horses hides
We had four million packets of bones

We had five million hogs, we had six million dogs
And seven million barrels of porter
We had eight million bags of the best Sligo rags
In the hold of the Irish Rover

We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And the ship lost her way in a fog
And the whole of the crew was reduced unto two
'Twas myself and the captain's old dog

And then she heeled right over,
Turned nine times around, and the poor dog was drowned

Stay a week or two for time was not your master

The Dubliners,"In the County Tyrone, near the town of Dungannon,
Where many the ructions meself had a hand in.
Bob Williamson lived, a weaver by trade,
And all of us thought him a stout Orange blade,
On the Twelfth of July as it yearly did come,
Bob played with his flute to the sound of a drum.
You may talk of your harp, your piano or lute,
But none can compare with the Old Orange Flute.

Bob, the deceiver, he took us all in;
He married a Papist named Bridget McGinn.
Turned Papist himself and forsook the old cause
That gave us our freedom, religion and laws.
Now, boys of the townland made some noise upon it,
And Bob had to fly to the province of Connaught.
He fled with his wife and his fixings to boot,
And along with the latter his Old Orange Flute.

At the chapel on Sunday to atone for past deeds,
He'd say Pater and Aves and counted his brown beads.
'Til after some time, at the priest's own desire
He went with that old flute to play in the choir.
He went with that old flute for to play for the Mass,
But the instrument shivered and sighed, oh, alas,
And try though he would, though it made a great noise,
The flute would play only ""The Protestant Boys.""

Bob jumped and he stared and got in a flutter
And threw the old flute in the blessed holy water.
He thought that this charm would bring some other
Sound;
When he tried it again, it played ""Croppies Lie Down.""
Now, for all he could whistle and finger and blow,
To play Papish music he found it no go.
""Kick the Pope"" and ""The Boyne Water"" it freely would
Sound,
But one Papish squeak in it couldn't be found.

At the council of priests that was held the next day
They decided to banish the old flute away.
They couldn't knock heresy out of it's head,
So they bought Bob a new one to play in it's stead.
'Twas fastened and burned at the stake as a heretic.
As the flames soared around it, they heard a strange
Noise;
'Twas the old flute still whistling ""The Protestant
Boys.""
""Toora lu, toora lay,
Oh, it's six miles from Bangor to Donnahadee.""",The Ould Orange Flute
The Dubliners,"I've been a wild rover for many's the year
And I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer
But now I'm returning with gold in great store 
And I never will play the wild rover no more

And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never no more 
Will I play the wild rover 
No, never no more

I went into an alehouse I used to frequent
And I told the landlady me money was spent
I asked her for credit, she answered me ""nay""
""Such a custom as yours I can have every day""

And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never no more 
Will I play the wild rover 
No, never no more

I then took from me pocket ten sovereigns bright
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
She says ""I have whiskeys and wines of the best""
And the words that you tolt me were only in jest

And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never no more 
Will I play the wild rover 
No, never no more

I'll home to my parents, confess what I'd done
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
And when they've caressed me as ofttimes before
I never will play the wild rover no more

And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never no more 
Will I play the wild rover 
No, never no more

The Dubliners,"In a neat little town they called Belfast 
Apprentice to trade I was bound
And many an hour's sweet happiness
Have I spent in that neat little town

As sad misfortune came over me
Which caused me to stray from the land
Far away from me friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band

Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

I took a stroll down broadway
Meaning not long for to stay
When who should I meet but this pretty fair maid
Come a-traipsing along the highway

She was both fair and handsome
Her neck, it was just like a swan
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid
And a gentleman passing us by
Well, I knew she meant the doing of him
By the look in her roguish black eye

A gold watch she took from his pocket
And placed it right into my hand
And the very first thing that I said, was
Bad 'cess to the black velvet band

Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

Before the judge and the jury
Next morning, I had to appear
The judge, he says to me
""Young man, you're case it is proven clear

We'll give you seven years penal servitude
To be spent far away from the land
Far away from your friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band""

Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

So come all you jolly young fellows
A warning take by me
When you are out on the town, me lads
Beware of the pretty Colleens

They'll feed you with strong drink, me lads
'Til you are unable to stand
And the very first thing that you'll know is
You've landed in Van Diemens Land

Her eyes they shown like diamonds
Her neck, it was just like a swan
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder

The Dubliners,"It's busk ye, me boy's, get you up on the deck
And take up your stations for hauling the nets
And mind up all together lads all through the night
And shaking your oilskins until it's daylight
With a heave and a haul and the shaking of nets

It's when we're at hauling we're living on hope
The boy in the locker the lads on the ropes
The fellows in the hold to our hauling the nets
And shaking the herring out on to the deck
With a heave and a haul and the shaking of nets

It's net after net we pull up from the sea
With a haul and a shake and a one, two and three
The herring are a piling around our sea boots
And slithering and sliding down into the shoots
With a heave and a haul and the shaking of nets

It's hour after hour we are hauling away
All through the long night till the dawn of the day
The captain's in the wheelhouse he's on the RT
And the cook's in the galley a brewing the tea
And we're heaving and hauling and shaking of nets

Now the season is over so be on your way
And head for the home port to sign for your pay
Your missus will be waiting to welcome you home
It's so hard for a wife to be so much alone
And you're finished with heaving and hauling of nets

The Dubliners,"I wish I was in Carrickfergus
Only for nights in Ballygrand
I would swim over the deepest ocean
Only for nights in Ballygrand
But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over
And neither have I the wings to fly
I wish I had a handsome boatsman
To ferry me over my love and I

(This verse is only sung on the 40 years cd)
My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy times there spent so long ago
My boyhood friends and my own relations
Have all past on now with the melting snow
So I'll spend my days in this endless roving
Soft is the grass and shore, my bed is free
Oh to be home now in carrickfergus
On the long rode down to the salty sea

Now in Kilkenny it is reported
On marble stone there as black as ink
With gold and silver I would support her
But I'll sing no more now til I get a drink
Cause I'm drunk today and I'm seldom sober
A handsome rover from town to town
Ah but I'm sick now my days are number
Come all me young men and lay me down
Come all me young men and lay me down.",Carrickfergus
The Dubliners,"While in the merry month of May, now from me home I started
Left, the girls of Tuam were nearly broken-hearted
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother
Then off to reap the corn and leave where I was born
Cut a stout, black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins
A brand-new pair of brogues to rattle over the bogs
And frighten all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin

A-one, two, three, four, five
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the ways to Dublin, whack, follol de-dah 

In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary
Started by daylight next morning blithe and early
Took a drop of pure to keep me heart from shrinking
Thats the Paddy's cure when'er he's on for drinking
To hear the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a-bubblin'
They asked me was I hired and wages I required to lay
Was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin

One, two, three, four, five
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the ways to Dublin, whack, follol de-dah 

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city
So then I took a stroll, all among the quality
Bundle it was stolen, in a neat locality
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind
No bundle could I find upon me stick a-wobblin'
'Quiring after the rogue, said me Connaught brogue
It wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin

One, two, three four, five
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the ways to Dublin, whack, follol de-dah 

From there I got away, me spirits never falling
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing
Captain at me roared, said that no room had he
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy
Down among the pigs, did some hearty rigs
I played some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin

One, two, three four, five
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the ways to Dublin, whack, follol de-dah

The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing
""Hurrah me soul"" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly
Galway boys were by and saw I was a hobblin'
With a ""lo!"" and ""hurray !"" they joined in the affray
Quickly cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin

One, two, three four, five
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the ways to Dublin, whack, follol de-dah",The Rock Road to Dublin

The Dubliners,"On the Fourth of July, 1806
We set sail from the sweet Cove of Cork
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
For the Grand City Hall in New York
'Twas a wonderful craft
She was rigged fore and aft
And oh, how the wild wind drove her
She stood several blasts
She had twenty seven masts
And they called her The Irish Rover

We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
We had two million barrels of stones
We had three million sides of old blind horses hides'
We had four million barrels of bones
We had five million hogs
six million dogs
Seven million barrels of porter
We had eight million sides of old nanny goate tails
In the hold of the Irish Rover

There was awl Mickey Coote
Who played hard on his flute
And the ladies lined up for a set
He would tootle with skill
For each sparkling quadrille
Though the dancers were fluther'd and bet
With his smart witty talk
He was cock of the walk
As he rolled the dames under and over
They all knew at a glance
When he took up his stance
That he sailed in The Irish Rover

There was Barney McGee
From the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
There was Johnny McGurk
Who was scared stiff of work
And a man from Westmeath called Malone
There was Slugger O'Toole
Who was drunk as a rule
And Fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
And your man, Mick McCann
From the banks of the Bann
Was the skipper of the Irish Rover

For a sailor its' always a bother in life
It's so lonesome by night and by day
That he longs for the shore
and a charming young whore
Who will melt all his troubles away
Oh, the noise and the rout
Swillin' poiteen and stout
For him soon the torment's over
Of the love of a maid he is never afraid
An old salt from the Irish Rover

We had sailed seven years
When the measles broke out
And the ship lost its way in the fog
And that whale of a crew
Was reduced down to two
Just myself and the Captain's old dog
Then the ship struck a rock
Oh Lord! what a shock
The bulkhead was turned right over
Turned nine times around
And the poor old dog was drowned (1, 2, 3!)
I'm the last of The Irish Rover",The Irish Rover [Live]

The Dubliners,"In the town of Spring Hill, Nova Scotia
Down in the heart of the Cumberland Mine
There's blood on the coal and miners lie
In the roads that never saw sun or sky
Roads that never saw sun or sky

Down at the coal face the miner's working
Rattle of the belt and the cutter's blade
Crumble of rock and the walls close round
Living and the dead men, two miles down
Living and the dead men, two miles down

Twelve men lay two miles from the pitshaft
Listen for the drilling of a rescue team
Six hundred feet of coal and slag
Hope imprisoned in a three-foot seam
Hope imprisoned in a three-foot seam

Eight days passed and some were rescued
Leaving the dead to lie alone
All their lives they dug their graves
Two miles of earth for a marking stone

Often the Earth will tremble and groan

On a stormy night
And she couldn't shut her eyes
And she couldn't blow out the light

And let the candle burn

That she had to brave the weather

And she said ""that's right""
She was looking for an eardrum
So she beat him and she shoved
'Til he couldn't quite resist her when she dragged him home for love

And the shadows fell across them
As she held their eyes together
And they cried

Would you be my ocean
Won't you be the rain
Can a kiss from you rinse another from my brain
Can we wash these floorboards
Can we wash these walls
Can I close my eyes and sleep once and for all

Filled from floor to roof with water
And a man who calmly calls her ""darling dear""
Not ""darling daughter""

Don't forget about me
I hope it's everything that you

Beware the sharks

If you ever get famous
Show your face now and then

Ways in the wind
And we can't get them back again

Roll on, roll on, roll on
So many days in the week
Let them roll on by

It's a rainy night and your
Headlights hit the water in the streets
And the rain beats down

And keep an eye on the driver
Cause as the highway unwinds,
Boy, the way home fades and can
Be so hard to find

So many days in the week
You keep on running round
So many days in the week
You've been running all your life

Opens up her red mouth
And gold word ribbons rope and rodeo
The dark clouds in bouquet above

For how long must we wait to learn?
Across the black and fossil ocean vast
I spy love and she doth brightly burn

Opens up her huge mind and
Thoughts descending spears of crystal
Build a Jacob's ladder up to love

Show skin of rubber marble
Lit by knowledge and the fireflies above

I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile

Sawdust balls with a moth-eaten parrot

Cap'in Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, 
""Daddy, oh, don't you dare! 

""He gives me fever
""With his kisses
""Fever when he holds me tight
""Fever! I'm his misses, So
""Daddy, Won't you treat him right?""

Now you've listened to my story, 
Here's the point that I have made:
Chicks were born to give you fever, 
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade

They give you fever
When you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever! 'till you sizzle

Searching gold in the midnight cold

We traveled arm in arm, at the same pace
Keeping each other warm in the rising storm

Searching gold
Where's the gold
That we'll share
As we share the road?

Tree trunks had fallen down on our way
Rocks of the ice age that would not stir
We lifted all that troubled our haste
One spell, one voice for one single aim

Searching gold, will we find it?
Where's the gold
That we'll share
As we share the road?

They're only trailing behind, what can I say

All dried out in the sun

Ooh

You were far too young, dear
To get so close to the clouds
No one told you to stay awake
For pleasures of that kind

Sting their hearts with darts

With a polar bear up there
How am I gonna travel light?

Like a lion in a cage, starving wild
And I've ran out of meat

Something crawling like a snake
In my bed, made me rip off my sheets

Well, it's an awkward situation
Trying to fight the jungle alone
But I gotta make my way through
If I wanna travel light

Lately I've been walking away
Floating like a song in the air
Lately I've been trailing away
I've been walking my way

I was standing on the edge
Of a mountain of clay
And I got tired of wading through the mud
So I jumped to hit the ground
It was firm yet it was hard
And I stood proudly up with my pain

Now, I don't care about the scratches
No one followed me this far
Oh, broken bones but empty head
I made it on my own, this far

If I just think about it, I'm always wasting time
Applying cream to this.
It never stops the itching, the burning cracking skin
And I have had enough of it

We are the most challenged of friends
Taking what we need to live
But I will fall with one more pull or pluck of this

Pray for the time, I've got my mind, set, pay for the seats
I've got to see the way we pull through

We are the most shallow of friends
Taking what we want to live
But I will fall with one more pull or pluck of this

Anybody got a second wind for a tired man with a broken gift
Anybody got a second chance for a man giving up on it

Back at the ocean to meet with dirt where we will wait and find ourselves.

Pull the covers back over my face.

One thing missing every time I leave and drive
One thing missing every time I'm far from home

Can I say I miss you for lack to obtain.
Oh just a few good reasons to keep this interesting,
But again I lack in social skills.
So can I say I need you for planning my next trip.
Oh on a guilt vacation. I feel sorry for it.

But again, it's not the first time thought I was losing what was mine.
I won't wait for a reason,
I'm taking over and back what is mine.
I won't wait forever.

Can I say I want you. it's a quarter to ten.
For so many reasons, I hate to turn to this.

But again, it's not the first time thought I was losing what was mine.
I won't wait for a reason,
I'm taking over and back what is mine.
I won't wait forever.

But again, it's not the first time thought I was losing what was mine.
I won't wait for a reason,
I'm taking over and back what is mine.
I won't wait forever.

We're in love, sweet love.
We're in love, sweet love.

We built our life from nothing.
We don't have much, no more money
But we've got love.
We can only grow much better
I'm so glad we're here together, and on our own, in love.

And in just a few more years
I'll prove everyone wrong.

The broken hearts

Obsessed on finding out who I really was
Turning all of the joists timelines

Becoming sand to remain that way forever

To where they were going seemed so much better than

Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinking smart
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, clutch and be up
But baby I ain't on that stuff

And he called the girl out with a curse
Saying ""Take her, Goddamn her, you've won her
She's yours now for better or worse""
Her arms had to tighten around me
As we rode down the hills to the south
Not a word did I hear from her that day
Nor a kiss from her pretty young mouth

We carved on a cradle of pine
By the fire in that neat little cabin

When you walked away
What was in your mind
To turn and leave it all behind?
The One True Love
Was it not enough?
So now, tell me what did you find?

Did pain embrace you with open arms
While hurt was scratching at all your scars
And love, so close yet seemed so far...

Love's not far, far behind
It's never too late to change your mind
When you fall and start to cry
There's always a second time
There's always a second time

Now that you're away
What do you feel inside?
A never-ending playground ride?
Now you've fallen off
Some kind of twisted fate
So now, why do you hesitate?

You look and wish on a falling star
Does it remind you of who you are?
He wants to heal up your broken heart...

Love's not far, far behind
It's never too late to change your mind
When you fall and start to cry

Foolish sense of pride that you won't cast down
When the tension comes around
Is the empty dark now your source of light?
Is your conviction losing sight?
In a house so grey is where you choose to stay
And now you're...

Waiting for the end of the day
Waiting for the end of the shame
Waiting for the end of the blame
Waiting for the end of the pain
Waiting for the end of the day

When you look so young, but you feel so old
And your heart is growing cold
Take a piece of hope and let your heart take hold
And watch his peace unfold
Your sense of guilt and fear
Your fear of guilt and loss
Was all it ever cost
With no more role that you will play
You can step out of the way
That left you...

The Echoing Green,"This is why events unnerve me 
They find it all, a different story 
Notice whom for wheels are turning 
Turn again and turn towards this time 
All she ask's the strength to hold me 
Then again the same old story 
World will travel, oh so quickly 
Travel first and lean towards this time 
Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown, 
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time, 
Watching her, these things she said, 
The times she cried, 
Too frail to wake this time. 
Oh I'll break them down, no mercy shown 
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time, 
Avenues all lined with trees, 
Picture me and then you start watching, 
Watching forever, forever, 
Watching love grow, forever, 
Letting me know, forever.

The Echoing Green,"An empty photograph
A lonely picture of my heart...
Unexpressed.
And all this sentiment
That I've chose to keep at bay
Has left a debt that I can't pay

The feelings on my mind
I save them for another time
Tomorrow - it never comes
And I still feel the sorrow

Now all that's left are memories
Promises and guarantees of tomorrow
I never thought
That this would be the last time
That we'd say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

The little things that I remember
Seem to fade away like shifting sand
If only...
I could touch your hand
And try to turn back time
And all the things I'd say instead
But words unsaid are left for dead

The feelings on my mind
I save them for another time
Tomorrow - it never comes
And I still feel the sorrow

Now all that's left are memories
Promises and guarantees of
Tomorrow - I never thought
That this would be the last time
That we'd say
Goodbye
Goodbye

The Echoing Green,"New gold dream
She's the one in front of me, sirens and the ecstasy
New gold dream
Crashing beats and fantasy, setting sun in front of me

And the world goes hot
And the cities take
And the beat goes crashing
All along the way

And when you dream, dream in the dream with me
And when you dream, and when you dream
Dream in the dream with me, with me

Eighty-one, eighty-two, eighty-three, eighty-four
Eighty-one, eighty-two, eighty-three, eighty-four
Eighty-one, eighty-two, eighty-three, eighty-four
Eighty-one, eighty-two, eighty-three, eighty-four

She is your only friend until the ocean breaks

And when you dream and the dreams don't stop
And the world goes on dream with me
And when you dream and the dreams don't stop
And the world goes on dream with me, dream with me

And when you dream and the dreams don't stop
And the world goes on dream with me
And when you dream and the dreams don't stop
And the world goes on dream with me, dream with me

When an XKE pulled up on the right
He rolled down the window of his shiny new Jag
And challenged me then and there to a drag

I said ""You're on buddy -- my mill's running fine
Let's come off the line now at Sunset and Vine
But I'll go you one better, if you've got the nerve
Let's race all the way -- to Dead Man's Curve""

We were buggin' each other while we sat out the light
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green
You shoulda heard the whine from my screamin' machine!

I flew past La Brea, Schwab's and Crescent Heights
And all the Jag could see were my six taillights
He passed me at Doheny then I started to swerve
But I pulled her out and there we were - at Dead Man's Curve

And I'm hiding behind your sofa
I'm the culture shock, temporary block
And I?ll love you for the next five minutes

I'm your magazine, ?'cause you read me clean
Without taking any time for pictures
I'm your hand grenade and your lemonade
?'cause I?ll blow up and leave you soured

Find somebody with a working car
And drive them crazy, too
The big surprise is me

I worked extra hard to pick your birthday card
You just threw it out and kept my money
I got up at six to make your favorite dish
So I sank when you said, you weren't hungry

Filed your tax return, let some candles burn
Played Mozart, to make your plants grow
Then I clipped the trees, got down on my knees
Not to work, just to pray, you'd see me

Find somebody who will paint your house
And gloss them over, too

Someone to hold a candle with me, let the night fires burn
It's not what I choose, it's what I feel

Understand it's in your hand to turn the other way
Make tomorrow the first day

All wonderful but none as grand as the man who chooses life
And we compete in word and deed
You think we'd learn by now that's not what people need
But that's our style

So raise the glass and look right past the time you've thrown away
The tragedies and enemies, the debts you'll never pay
Now understand it's in your hand to turn the other way
And make tomorrow the first day

Birds take to the sky, we open our eyes
You're saying hello, I'm waving goodbye to the old days

So raise the glass and look right past the time you've thrown away

The Elms,"I sit in the willows, my hat on my knee.
There's a man in my shoes where a boy used to be.
I'm wore-out and weary, but before my time's done
I need to find me a place in the sun.

Well, life shot right by me. It's hard to explain.
The days started passing, now they all look the same.
Well, every good spirit needs someplace to run,
So I need to find me a place in the sun.

A place where the golden rays
Dance on the waterways.
Where time passes easily,
And burdens don't trouble me.

I'd feel like a millionaire,
Sat on a foldin' chair
Watching you dance in the breeze.

I don't know a fella who ain't seen it tough.
We deal and we hustle to make just enough.
But somewhere the people are still having fun,
So I'm gonna find me that place in the sun.

A place where there's little rain,
And good memories remain.
Somewhere you can take a drive
Back to a simple time.

I'd feel like all royalty
Sat near an olive tree
Free from my work for awhile.

Is sinkin' back into the hills
Well, the neon lights start flickerin' on
And the roadhouse starts to fill

You can bet your ass by ten o'clock
It'll be all that you can take
To squeeze inside with the girls and guys
Who come out to do the shake

Shake it 'til you can't shake it out no more
Do it 'til your feet come off the floor
Put a little shake in your rattle and roll
Shake it 'til you can't shake it out no more

Comin' off everybody's skin
And the rhythm grows in people's bones
Like it's comin' from within

Don't come out here lookin' just to chill
Or to sit down and take a break
The only thing to try 'round here tonight
Is get up and do the shake

Shake it 'til you can't shake it out no more
Do it 'til your feet come off the floor
Put a little shake in your rattle and roll
Shake it 'til you can't shake it out no more

Don't matter who your daddy is
What side of the street that you grew up on

Like a dark horizon before my eyes.
Better pray for peace, and guard my kin

Through the deeper valley where few will pass. 
I will set my feet, and raise my chin

When the tide's rushin' in, the and the cold winds come blowing?

The Embarrassment,"Ah, ah,
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow

Will drive our ships to new lands,
To fight the horde, singing and crying,

On we sweep with threshing oar,
Our only goal will be the western shore
Ah, ah,

From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow

How soft your fields so green,
Can whisper tales of gore,
Of how we calmed the tides of war

So put a little love away

Someone's gotta leave, somebody's gotta stay behind
So put a little love away

Two people sharing one tear too many
Look around for miracles, you know they don't find any
I've seen it coming but what am I supposed to do?
Just take a closer look around and simply say to you

I confess I've ruined three lives
Now don't sleep so tight
Because I didn't care till I found out that one of them was mine

Night after night time time after time
Done too much of both types of whining
Still wasn't right fight after fight
To get out of my life get away from me get away from that gun

No it's not a joke it's cards on the table time
I could have phoned I could have spoke
But how to break the news without beaking your heart

Being dead don't hurt,
No only dying
Cards on the table time,
Sometimes it's right to say goodnight

Always searching for paradise,
I'll admit that I'm good as blind
Darling I confess yes I've ruined three lives
And didn't care till I found out that one of them was mine

I confess
Our love seems like a punishment
And I confess,
If it's all the same to you I'll stay indifferent

Don't pretend like you don't know why,

Blinded by fright

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

The Englishmen,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Doesn't mean you have to be shallow and uptight

And just because you're pale
It doesn't mean you have to be callow
Doesn't mean you have to believe you're always right

You should see yourself , baby you lack vision
You should see yourself through the eyes of the world
You should see yourself, your clockwork ambition
You should see yourself, or would you rather go blind?
See yourself, yeah, see yourself

Can you take this little megaphone
And push it in your eardrum?
Can you try to listen very carefully?

Can you stare up at that wall chart
And look at those red letters?
Can you try to read them through from A to Z?

Well, just because it's funny
Doesn't mean you have to be foolish
Doesn't mean you have to wish you ruled this world

And just because it's sunny
Doesn't mean you have to blot the sun out
Doesn't mean your lips always have to curl

You should see yourself, baby you lack vision
You should see yourself, get a pair of eyes
You should see yourself, go to your optician
You should see yourself through that framework of lies

You should see yourself, everybody else can
You should see yourself, it's not a pretty sight
You should see yourself through those crocodile tear glands
You should see yourself, or would you rather go blind?
See yourself, you should see yourself, yeah

And if that's the case then I guess in 20 years
I'll be sitting in this bar room still

Cause you were the one
I felt that I was lucky just to have you by my side
Now it's 10 years gone and I'm sitting all alone
With this bottle for a place to hide

Bar time is 6:30
And you're still on my mind
By 8:15 I'll have had a couple in me
And I've already forgotten you were even mine

By 9:43 I'll be regretting my decisions
And cursing this city of sin
By 10:15 I'll be stinking of whiskey
And thinking of you again

I've heard it said by many of my friends
You were a girl I should leave alone
They said all you're gonna get
Is a pocket full of regrets and broken down rotary phone

Now all I got are those and fifteen ""I told you so's""
So I guess I'm the one to blame
Sitting on a stool feeling like a broken fool
A tarnished drunkard with a tarnished name",Stinking of Whiskey Blues
The Ernies,"My world is all spring flowers
Underneath the autumn moon
Your arms around me carry
Away my heart like a lost red balloon
As long as I am flesh and bone
I will never find rest
There will never come a time
When I can finally resist
Too caught up in the world of pleasure, 
I'm carnal knowledge just lookin for treasure of the flesh,
Displayin neurosis, seein all the crowds around has givin me a psychosis, 
I'm crazy, makin me lazy, my mind is all hazy, 
The things that you do amaze me, 
Jealous of the fools that are all around me, 
Another heathen that's never really found me.",Flesh and Bone
The Ernies,"Well, I thought about the scene a lot and I've come to the conclusion, back in the day we used to admit to the confusion that exists between real styles and illusion, but I must tell you if you think that we are losin our honesty because we are bustin' out like confusions on those of you who think that you are choosin the right of way because you hear it everyday, well turn off your radio turn it off all the way. We're not ska-core, reggae, jazz, we're not hip hop or rock or pop, you know we won't stop groovin', it's like a thing called Jive!, you mix it up and keep the people satisfied no need to classify or nullify the claims that say we're insane, so to pacify those of you who need a label call it what you want I know you'll kick it if you're able.
We call it Jive!
Don't get me wrong, I don't think that we're special just 'cause our sound is not that commercial, or maybe it is, maybe that's not for me to say, but I've seen less honest music everyday, just like our soundless souls that are sold on the radio melodramatic lyrics made up like Fabio, they hide reality in a well made allusion to a world where the real is illusion.
We call it Jive!
Well, I remember the times we used to hit downtown Richmond got kicked out the Metro, me and my Blind Jeans, my Indy hat ended up on the street and I went back for a smoke in my Capri. Back then is when we used to swang, rankin, and skankin was the thang until the music scene back home sold out, that's when me and my crew decided to show them what it's all about for the old skool we were late, we put down the skates, started grabbin' guitars horns drums and the bass kickin it live inside the garage hittin' them with a lyrical barrage but it's like we're trippin' tips shit got drastically of a sudden , the need to play bombastically, we lost sight of what is real it took us this long to get back on the reel to reel.
We call it Jive!",Jive!
The Ernies,"Jump, jump up and get down while we're kickin' it live, mad shout outs to all of you, who made it possible like you and your crew but every now and then, I can hear the voices of those of you who think our choices are wrong, you're feelin' like you don't at the show, can't understand the way things swing, you know, wase your mind and there is no need to worry, 'cause like The Ernies, I know that you're kickin it live!!
If I could show you just what goes through my head...
Things change, that's how it is can you deal, with things that you know are real, I'm always movin, changin, and rearranging, I'm sick and tired of those who try containin me don't you see I'm in a state of flux don't you know, it's got nothin to do with luck, but if you want to know what's up with us, we're still a bunch of rude boys, causin a fuss while we're kickin it live!
If I could show you just what goes through my head...
There were a couple of girls who used to come to the shows back when we used to jam every Wednesday at the Zone they were skankin to the beat, I'm like ""Hey, I like your shirt"" to the one who was up in my shit I guess she was tryin to flirt she said ""yo, you're like the bosstones"" I said ""Hey, what's up with that?"" we've got our own thing going and we know it's where its at, now every time I see 'em they're talking about we're wannabe's, but they're the ones that are payin whether they're wack when they come or what, see.....we're kickin it live!

To the things that we're fighting for?

The Ernies,"I sat on the end of my bed with my legs
Shoved between the foot board and the mattress
And I stared at my hands as you came in
And asked me what was wrong
""Have you ever wondered why you are your name?
Or why you are here and not somewhere else?
Or why here is where it is, and the whole time
You feel like you're spinning and falling?""
I stopped and looked at him.

""No.""",The New One

It's times like this that I realize that 
Some people stay and some people go
But how in the hell are we suppose to know
Just what to do and how to do it
Someone tell me how to get through this
In the back that's where you belong
I'll go crazy before it's too long
I look around but I can't see
What's going on or what's happening to me
Another day and I'll have to deal
Never losing touch of what is real
I'd do it all again, but not quite the same

To be insane
Forgive me not or forgive me do
I'll do my best to forget about you",Put You in the Back
