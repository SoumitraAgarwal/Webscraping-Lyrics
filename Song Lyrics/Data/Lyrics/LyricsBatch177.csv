Il Volo,"Smile, without a reason why
Love, as if you were a child
Smile, no matter what they tell you
Don’t listen to a word they say
‘Cause life is beautiful that way

Tears, a tidal-wave of tears
Light that slowly disappears
Wait, before you close the curtain
There’s still another game to play
And life is beautiful that way

Here, in his eyes forever more
I will always be as close as you remember from before

Now, that you’re out there on your own
Remember, what is real and what we dream is love alone

Keep the laughter in your eyes
Soon, your long awaited prize
We'll forget about our sorrow
And think about a brighter day
‘Cause life is beautiful that way

We'll forget about our sorrow
And think about a brighter day
‘Cause life is beautiful that way

Before you close the curtain
There's still another game to play
Life is beautiful that way",Beautiful That Way (La Vita È Bella)
Il Volo,"I'll be loving you eternally
With a love that's true, eternally
From the start, within my heart
It seems I've always known
The sun would shine
When you were mine
And mine alone

I'll be loving you eternally
There'll be no one new, my dear, for me
Though the sky should fall
Remember I shall always be
Forever true and loving you
Eternally

(I'll be loving you eternally)
With a love that's true, eternally
From the start, within my heart
It seems I've always known

Though the sky should fall

Forever true and loving you
Eternally

Forever true and loving you

Il Volo,"Penso che un sogno così non ritorni mai più
Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu
Poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito
E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito

Volare oh, oh
Cantare oh, oh, oh
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù
E volavo, volavo felice più in alto del sole
Ed ancora più su
Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva lontano laggiù
Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me

Volare oh, oh
Cantare oh, oh, oh
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù

Ma tutti i sogni nell'alba svaniscon perché
Quando tramonta la luna li porta con sé
Ma io continuo a sognare negli occhi tuoi belli
Che sono blu come un cielo trapunto di stelle

Volare oh, oh
Cantare oh, oh, oh
Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu
Felice di stare quaggiù
E continuo a volare felice più in alto del sole
Ed ancora più su
Mentre il mondo pian piano scompare negli occhi tuoi blu
La tua voce è una musica dolce che suona per me

Volare oh, oh
Cantare oh, oh, oh
Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu
Felice di stare quaggiù
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Felice di stare quaggiù
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Felice di stare quaggiù
Con te","Nel Blu, Dipinto Di Blu (Volare)"
Il Volo,"Io canto, il mio amore per te
Questa notte diventa poesia
La mia voce sarà
Una lacrima di nostalgia
Non ti chiederò mai
Perché da me sei andata via
Per me è giusto
Tutto quello che fai

Io ti amo
E gridarlo vorrei
Ma la voce dell'anima
Canta piano lo sai
Io ti amo
E gridarlo vorrei
Ma stasera non posso nemmeno parlare
Perché piangerei

Io canto, la tristezza che è in me
Questa notte sarà melodia
Piango ancora per te
Anche se ormai è una follia
Non ti chiedo perché
Adesso tu non sei più mia
Per me è giusto
Tutto quello che fai

Io ti amo
E gridarlo vorrei
Ma la voce dell'anima
Canta piano e lo sai
Io ti amo
E gridarlo vorrei
Ma stasera non posso nemmeno parlare
Perché piangerei
Io ti amo! Io ti amo!",Quando l'amore diventa poesia
Il Volo,"Non c'è dolore, se ci sei tu
E' come un sogno, anche di più
E c'è qualcosa negli occhi tuoi che non mi lascia mai
Non ho paura se resti qui, perché l'amore mi chiude gli occhi
Vorrei baciarti, adesso sì, vorrei che fosse così

L'amore si muove
Ti porta lontano se vuoi
Ti prende per mano senza dirti dove andrai
L'amore si muove
E non fa rumore, lo sai
E' un vento gentile che non ti abbandona mai

Come un regalo, così inatteso
Una sorpresa tu lì per caso
C'era qualcosa negli occhi tuoi che non scorderò mai

L'amore si muove
Ti porta lontano se vuoi
Ti prende per mano senza dirti dove andrai
L'amore si muove e non fa rumore, lo sai
E' un vento gentile che non ti abbandona mai

E penso a quello che sarei
A quello che saremo noi
All'amore che ci porta via

L'amore si muove
Ti porta lontano se vuoi
Ti prende per mano senza dirti dove andrai
L'amore si muove e non fa rumore, lo sai
E' un vento gentile che non ti abbandona mai
L'amore si muove",L' Amore si muove
Il Volo,"Stasera è come se
Una parte di me l’abbian strappata via
Dove sei? Mi lasci cosi
Solo qui, pensieri che tormentano

Aspetterò
Le stelle pregherò
Un giorno ti rivredrò
Il tuo sorriso splenderà
Ti sentirò
Io ti respirerò
Amore, prometterò
Senza più limiti io ti aspetterò

Che notte, mi sembra che
I minuti non passino, sembrano un’eternità
Ma perché ti sei chiusa in te?
Ma perché sei sparita tu senza dirmi un perché

Aspetterò
Le stelle pregherò
Un giorno ti rivedrò, il tuo sorrido splenderà
Ti sentirò
Io ti respirerò
Amore, prometterò
Senza limiti io ti aspetterò

E chissà se sola nell’oscurità
Ti ricordi momenti, tremori di questo amore

Aspetterò
Le stelle pregherò
Un giorno ti rivedrò
Il tuo sorriso splenderà
Ti sentirò
Io ti respirerò
Amore, prometterò
Io ti aspetterò per sempre
Aspetterò
Aspetterò",Aspettero'
Il Volo,"Siamo qui noi soli
Come ogni sera
Ma tu sei più triste
Ed io lo so
Perché

Forse tu vuoi dirmi
Che non sei felice
Che io sto cambiando
E tu mi vuoi lasciar

Io che non vivo
Più di un'ora senza te
Come posso stare una vita
Senza te
Sei mia
Sei mia
Mai niente lo sai
Separarci un giorno potrà

Vieni qui, ascoltami
Io ti voglio bene
Te ne prego fermati
Ancora insieme a me
Io che non vivo
Più di un'ora senza te
Come posso stare una vita
Senza te
Sei mia
Sei mia

Io che non vivo
Più di un'ora senza te
Come posso stare una vita

Il Volo,"Io son sicuro che, per ogni goccia
Per ogni goccia che cadrà, un nuovo fiore nascerà
E su quel fiore una farfalla volerà
Io son sicuro che, in questa grande immensità
Qualcuno pensa un poco a me
Non mi scorderà

Sì, io lo so
Tutta la vita sempre solo non sarò
Un giorno troverò
Un po’ d’amore anche per me
Per me che sono nullità
Nell'immensità

Sì, io lo so
Tutta la vita sempre solo non sarò
E un giorno io saprò
D’essere un piccolo pensiero

Del suo cielo",L' Immensità
Il Volo,"È notte alta e sono sveglio
Sei sempre tu il mio chiodo fisso
Insieme a te ci stavo meglio
E più ti penso e più ti voglio
Tutto il casino fatto per averti
Per questo amore che era un frutto acerbo
E adesso che ti voglio bene io ti perdo

Ancora, ancora, ancora
Perché io da quella sera
Non ho fatto più l'amore senza te
E non me ne frega niente senza te
Anche se incontrassi un angelo direi
Non mi fai volare in alto quanto lei

È notte alta e sono sveglio
E mi rivesto e mi rispoglio
Mi fa smaniare questa voglia
Che prima o poi farò lo sbaglio
Di fare il pazzo venir sotto casa
Tirare sassi alla finestra accesa
Prendere a calci la tua porta chiusa, chiusa

Ancora, ancora, ancora
Perché io da quella sera
Non ho fatto più l'amore senza te
E non me ne frega niente senza te
Ancora, amore
Ancora, amore, ancora
Perché io da quella sera
Non ho fatto più l'amore senza te
E non me ne frega niente senza te",Ancora
Il Volo,"La festa appena cominciata
È già finita
Il cielo non è più con noi
Il nostro amore era l’invidia di chi è solo
Era il mio orgoglio la tua allegria
È stato tanto grande e ormai
Non sa morire
Per questo canto e canto te
La solitudine che tu mi hai regalato
Io la coltivo come un fiore

Chissà se finirà
Se un nuovo sogno
La mia mano prenderà
Se a un’altra io dirò
Le cose che dicevo a te
Ma oggi devo dire che
Ti voglio bene
Per questo canto e canto te
È stato tanto grande e ormai non sa morire
Per questo canto, e canto te

Chissà se finirà
Se un nuovo sogno
La mia mano prenderà
Se a un’altra io dirò
Le cose che dicevo a te
Ma oggi devo dire che
Ti voglio bene
Per questo canto e canto te
È stato tanto grande e ormai non sa morire
Per questo canto, e canto te, canto te
Per questo canto, e canto te",Canzone per te [2015 Version] [Version]
Il Volo,"Chiudo gli occhi e penso a lei
Il profumo dolce della pelle sua
E' una voce dentro che mi sta portando dove nasce il sole
Sole sono le parole
Ma se vanno scritte tutto può cambiare
Senza più timore te lo voglio urlare questo grande amore

Amore, solo amore è quello che sento
Dimmi perché quando penso, penso solo a te
Dimmi perché quando vedo, vedo solo te
Dimmi perché quando credo, credo solo in te grande amore
Dimmi che mai
Che non mi lascerai mai
Dimmi chi sei
Respiro dei giorni miei d’amore
Dimmi che sai
Che solo me sceglierai
Ora lo sai
Tu sei il mio unico grande amore

Passeranno primavere,
Giorni freddi e stupidi da ricordare
Maledette notti perse a non dormire altre a far l’amore

Amore, sei il mio amore per sempre, per me.
Dimmi perché quando penso, penso solo a te
Dimmi perché quando amo, amo solo te
Dimmi perché quando vivo, vivo solo in te grande amore
Dimmi che mai
Che non mi lascerai mai.
Dimmi chi sei
Respiro dei giorni miei d’amore
Dimmi che sai
Che non mi sbaglierei mai
Dimmi che sei
Che sei il mio unico grande amore
Che sei il mio unico grande amore",Grande amore

Tutti i colori dell’arcobaleno
Vanno a fermare una pioggia d’argento
Ma piove, piove sul nostro amor

Ciao, ciao, bambina, un bacio ancora
E poi per sempre io ti perderò
Come una fiaba, l’amore passa
C'era una volta poi non c’è più

Cos'è che trema sul tuo visino
È pioggia o pianto dimmi cos'è
Vorrei trovare parole nuove
Ma piove, piove sul nostro amor

iLe,"Se estrujan mis sentidos
No puedo despertar
Mi cuerpo ya curtido

Desenchufar todos mis dedos
Llegar a algún lugar

Estoy suspendida

Abriendo cual cirugía

Consumiendo en carne viva

iLe,"Si me dejo llevar, es para perderme
Si me debes mirar, es para quererme
Quiero vivir en mi mundo ciego
Y arrepentirme luego
Aunque se, que no eres suficiente para mi
Consolare todas mis iluciones para seguir aquí
Enredada en el nudo de tu mente infeliz
Calmando el matiz
No llores nostalgia
No me hieras así por favor

Mi cara mojada, la vuelvo a tender
Para que la sequé tu atardecer
Mi alma quebrada, que en ti se derrama
No se puede mover, ya no puedo pensar
Me duele el peso y me dulce soltar
Regalando lo que soy, olvidando lo que fui
Desvaneciendome en un mundo
Donde la realidad, es fácil de ocultar
No, llores nostalgia
No me hieras así, por favor",Danza Para No Llorar
iLe,"Me cruzaste de la mano
Y me nacieron dos antenas
Y mientras fotografiaban
Sin que nadie nos viera
Se posaron tus deditos 
Como rana en mi espalda

No sabia si moverme
Si dejarme acariciar
Me hacen faltan las caricias
En estas hora de amar
Y un brazo invisible me salió de la pared
De la piel, de mi espalda
Que esta extraña de querer

Se me estiraban los brazos
Y de ahí desde esa piel
Me salían una y una largas manos a la vez
Y de pronto tenía 8 y estaban alrededor de ti
Y fue justo cuando con dolor lo decidí

Que no podía continuar
En tan escueta canción
Que tus brazos y los míos 
Hacían una ovación
De cariños que no pueden
Por favor, hazme el amor
Dame toda la energía
Que necesito un favor

Para recuperar algo de lo que se echó a perder
Y vivir ya paso a paso con mi cría y su querer
Fuerzas para entender que no necesito mucho más que a mi
Me escribía PerKins Jeans sutilmente en su tapiz

Y trepe por las paredes llegué al techo, te perdí
Se me amarilló de pronto cierto trozo de nariz
Cuando mire hacia mi arriba te vi abajo a mis pies
Y en la tez se me veían amarillo de tu piel

Y fue que ahí que decidí, manos déjenlo salir
Y dejar que el aire cubra este mítico jardín
Se llenó de aire el mar luego casi no te vi
Y ya cuando regrésaste ya todo resulto al fin

Pero que noche mas loca y que linda a la vez
Descansar en cuatro notas que yo misma me invente
Tener alas, volar alto de la barra a orinar
Y lograr al fin callarte y a tus manos trasladar

Te doy gracias hoy, por tanto, por aquel viejo lugar
En el que con mis antenas nos logramos conectar
En el que una araña dulce por amar salió de mi
Y me convertí en insecto como Kafka en frenesí",Extraña de Querer
iLe,"Malditos sean los amores
Que te amarran sin consuelo
Malditos sean los abrazos
Que rasguñan el querer

Maldita pena ofendida
Que esclaviza una sonrisa
En la mirada perdida
De una batalla silente

¿Cómo quieres que te diga?
Que no puedo dependerte
¿Cómo quieres que yo viva?
Cuando ando para atrás
¿Dónde encuentro la salida a este laberinto?
Una luz algún instinto que desate en mi la paz

Maldita sean las parejas
Que dependen mutuamente
Mal rayo hundan las cadenas
Que no sabemos soltar

Mal rayo parta mi astucia
Cuando se oculta enseguida, quieta
Como muerta en vida
Sin siquiera reaccionar

iLe,"Can you feel what I'm feeling
Is there something on your mind
I'm still healing from the silence
That you left behind

Do my tears have any meaning?
Are you talking with your eyes?
Seems you´re speaking but your words
They come out dry

My heart is out of place
And what do you have to say?
It´s hard to see 
Through your childish face
When you keep running
Oh running away

Do you, do you think in silences?
Are you even here?
Do you, do you think in silences?
How does it feel?

Time goes by
And I'm not able to forget
Cloudy sky haven´t cleared up yet

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

[ VERSE 1: Soundwave ]
You say you never heard the Sound
I'm about to break em off somethin right now
Open up your mind and let me in
Knock-knock, who speaks in the voice of sin?
Must drop to your knees, please just listen
A tale of four blackmen reminiscin
I hover in the heavens like a celestial guardian
The one who blocks the bullets when you're wildin out partyin
Believe in the MC cause you can see me not
Soundwave, faster than the dot on the Glock
Non-stop cyber-funkin, let me tell you somethin
Bout that guy named Al Skratch, the Mack Big Ill, LIC
This is virtual reality
A rap fantasy of the life of four beings
Seen through the eyes of the one foreseeing
Funkin em up, come on to the right
I'm funkin em up, come on to the left
The Uptown Connect gonna funk you to death

[ VERSE 2: Al Skratch & Big Ill the Mack ]
Who want to fuck around, who want to clown
With two niggas from the Brooklyn Uptown underground
Well, it's the backstabber, the double-crosssin alki
Stagger as I'm babblin, so nigga please don't doubt me
When I was ten they took my flick at the precint
Back in the days I was a juvenile delinquent
So don't fuck with me cause I'm psychotic
I kick the hard shit and let my man get melodic
Aiyo, I'm rollin, rollin, rollin
I'll lump you up and leave you swollen
The mic that I'm holdin is golden
Patrollin straight out the fiery pits
I turn a page as my diary gets
Deeper, I see this Mack type figure, who is he?
Bitches want to know, so Ill get busy
I got the latest news, ask Conny Chung
Tu madre ( ? )
That means your mama want to suck my dick, faggot
The bitch is a hoe so you know I'm gonna bag it
We makin moves over funky fat grooves
And to crews that don't paid dues we bad news
So who want to gangbang, tell me who can hang; slang
Is what I kick, stay off my dick, chitty-bang-bang
With the glock you could swing on my block
And I'll knock the shit out of your ass with the quick fast
Who want to fuck around, who want to clown
With two niggas from the Brooklyn Uptown underground
Who want to fuck around, who want to clown

Here it is, steppin to my biz with the free flow steelo
Headcrackin niggas like celo
Comin from below the gutter, I'm quick with my cutter
For a fronter tryin to front, word to mother
On a microphone alone in a zone of danger
With rhymes written on my bullets in a chamber
Word up, you never heard of one murder one felon
Bustin more slugs in thugs indulge in drug-sellin
I stack greenbacks from the wizzacks
Give up raw facts for niggas fakin jacks
Rhymes come in all flavors, I'm makin crazy papers
Cuttin suckers with razors in faces, beatin body cases
LIC, I'm givin lashes, slashes
Holdin classes, controllin masses, bustin asses
Just when I put the ambush to spots
Bustin my mics like Glocks, robbin niggas for they props
The flow is on point, on target, sharp, accurate
Lyrical gun clips I pack you with, then clap you with
Rhyme after rhzzyme, time after time
Like a career criminal committin crime after crime
A gun-clapper ( ? ) type of rapper
LIC, code name come-off-the-head master
Flowin at a high velocity possibly
MC's might snitch, call the cops on me

[ VERSE 1: Al Skratch ]
I got a letter from my homie Big Ill in the mail
It said: Use your head, Al, stay away from jail
Cause ah, it ain't for you and ah, it ain't for me
I tell you now it ain't the place you want to be
So I keep to myself nowadays
Lay back, recline and get paid from my phrase
Sometimes I get caught in a deep thought
As I drink a quart of the cold old dog that I bought
The more I drink, the more I start to think of him
Locked up in the clink, will he sink or swim?
I'm what they call the rap rebel Madball
I'm nice with the dice, watch em bounce off the wall
I come to your party, bounce through with my crew
We pourin out some brew for some homies that we knew
I'm searchin for my homie but he can't be found
I want to give him a pound and let him know that he's down

Where the homies
Creepin through the hood
Where my homies
Come around my way
Aiyo up to no good

(Where my homies)
Where they at, where they at
(Creepin through the neighborhood
For all those good times we had together
This song is for the homies
This is for the homies)

[ VERSE 2: Big Ill the Mack ]
Well, it's Big Ill, the Babblin Bum, the bum that's babblin
Don't try to step to this, my fist be travellin
Unravellin, land on the gravel when you fall
Yes yes y'all, I travel through the messhall
Now where my homie, I'm by my lonely
I shoulda listened to what my mama told me
But it's too late, I'm upstate pumpin weight cause I'm frail
What you gonna do when you get out of jail?
Bust a cap, bust a cap, put that ass on the map
Here's a slap in the grill cause you tried to front on Ill
And I'm locked down (plow!) how the Glock sound?
That's what you get for tryin to blow up the spot, clown
That's the ability, load up the artillery
Your body I'll deliver to the river, gee
Remember me with the (Crooklyn residency)
Now you can take me out of Brooklyn but you can't take Brooklyn out of me
That's how it be, gee

For the missing homies
For all those good times we had together

This is for the homies, yeah)

Yeah, it's Al Skratch, that real smooth brother
The undercover lover makin' moves on your mother
If I have to, it's only natural, that I rap to
Any girl walkin' through my hood if she's lookin' good
And if she's somethin' fine, I'll be humpin' hind
Let's get it on, ain't nuthin' wrong, with a little 'Bump N Grind'

Now that's what my man say
Sometimes I lay in my bed, and I dream of bein' hand-fed
I made the jam, with my man, about the homiez
But now I must remember all about my tenderonis

You're lonely by your homey baby I know how you're feelin'
You in the mood for some sexual healin'
Walk in to the jump I spot you as the music's blarin'
Starin', but not carin', about, what you wearin'

You're full grown with a mind of your own
I make you moan as my bone turn brick like stone
Whether you're single we can mingle as you jingle
Swing low, with the black Mandingo

Hit you off, then I'm ghost somethin' proper like
Two things I never do. fall in love or drop a MIC
I'm Big Ill, now you know my style I'm glad you came
I give your man a pound, then I ask you what's your name

Sign a autograph, then I step with my staff
To the hotel, hope everything goes swell
That's what you say as I sway on my way to my room
Crazy deep, don't sleep I keep the poom poom

Jockin' clockin', knockin' out the box when, I perform
That's why the girlies they swarm to see Big Ill
Later on that night at the arena
I seen her, tryin' to get backstage between the

Niggaz I was wit and the security, she didn't
Lookin' from a distance I see her booty's hittin'
Stagger to the barricade and bag her as I grab her

Give me my taxes back money god's a liar
Speak truth to deaf americans like Tah Meraya

Let the revolvers solve 'em chaos miners a cosmic drama

Destory you like cancer of the brain
I can't be stopped
I'm faster than the plane that crashed into the trade center
Brain bending pain enter ya nervous system and make you want to turn the other way
Stick yo fuckin head in the dirt, don't even look in my direction
You define trash, I personify perfection
High beemin on the highway driving benzes
Crime scene lookin like a homicide convention
You walk around with a dick in ya mouth
don't ever let the kid joe take a shit in ya house
Trust my judgement, I make bitches lie to there husbands
At my crib on the cell phone crying they love them
Nobodys fault, its all good as long as nobodys caught
Jealousy, put bodys in morgues
Hungry for money and coke, put hotties in porn
won't stop till I put uncle howie in forbes

No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now

I've had my, ups and downs, dealt with cunts and clowns
Major label deals I've been fucked around
Spent years money dangling in front of my face
Instead of blowin the spot, bill was runnin the place
Payed mad dues, shows, made hundreds of tapes
Sold drugs studio time my gun in ya face
Look at me now, Non-Phixion running the game
Kings of the underground and we loving it man
Yea Ill punch you in your face when I'm out on tour
When we was with the beatnuts, I could count about four
Different occasions I had to lace a kid, cold duffed em
One dude bought me a drink after I snuffed em
Promoters talk out the side of they mouth
Till they spitten they own teeth out the side of they mouth
Even the bouncers was scared of us, Callin for peace
While the fagget that got his head cracked, called the police
Ill Bill be the mother fuckin future, its easy to tell
Fuck wit me, Ima see you in hell
So don't fuck wit a bull, achieve the impossible
Cause there ain't no stoppen the unstoppable

No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now

I found your lack of faith disturbing, now my aquisitions are merging
Streets are your, executions are murders, these goons will worship
Like methological gods, beating impossible odds
Comparable in the hood to killing thousands of cops
Pass the good in the bag, take it straight to the ugly
Made in New York, it spread now we raping the country
Stay with the vest, triple x pistols and sex
Money and murderers connect, equals instant success
Ripple effect, we invest, legitimate businessmen
Court rooms to ball rooms expanding the bussiness plan
Listen man, I'm old fashioned
Fuck taking over answer, kidnapp the family and hold em for ransom
We gettin dough yawll, its the jump off
Eather you get with us or fuck off
An unstoppable fource on a rough course
Big success, fuck with me you fuckin wit the best
Fuck who's on top, cause I'm a lot hungrier than them

No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now",Unstoppable

“'till death do us part,”
And I remember the day
I saw you die.
The road is what we get
And you went and got it started.
The way we would act when they
All held us back, and the time
We would spend with the others
Who laughed when we laughed...

These things we've imagined
Would take soft advantage
Of what quickly destroyed us
In asides of the night, well
They've returned with a vengeance
And they're demanding the answers
To the questions
That lock us in our lives.

I remember the accidents
We always called “accidents”.
I remember the way I learned to lie
Down with another type of child.
I still try and cover my eyes
Before the light can blind me,
Carelessly.

I beg to myself put my pride up on the shelf
Life is not forever
But if life will stay together
I would have a friend in my depression, have an end

But I've been thinking
And thinking always gets me into trouble
But since I have a double personality
I wasn't me you see
Now I'm a refugee

This place is so quiet sensing that storm

Red rain is pouring down
Pouring down all over me

Well I've seen them buried,
In a sheltered place in this town
They tell you that this rain can sting and look down
La sangre ne está and I see no sign of pain
Hey, no pain
Seeing no rojo, I see no rain

Red rain is coming down
Red rain
Red rain is pouring down
Pouring down all over me

Putting the pressure on much harder now
Restar again and again
Just let the red rain splash you
Let the rain fall on your skin
I've come to you defences down
With the trust of a child

El sol se fue, se fue de aquí 
Se fue de fuego no lo sentí 
Yo me quede sobre el país 
Para morir y revivir 

Allá en Barranca, en San Miguel, 
O sobre el barro de Pudahuel 
Entre los pasos del hombre fiel 
Una y mil veces, me volveré, me volveré 
Me volveré, me volveré, me volveré 

Canción de ayer, canción de hoy 
Que va golpeando a mi población 
Antigua y cruel como el dolor 
Del hambre frío de la nación 

Pues un patriota, un gran señor 
Me está apuntando en el corazón, 
Para tildarme de Juan traidor 
Y yo soy flor tan solo flor, 
Tan solo flor, tan solo flor 

Me hice flor de un color 
En el silencio de mi temor 
Y me junté y fuimos dos 
Y como piedra ya somos diez, 
Porque en el fondo del corazón 
Que nos abraza con su calor 
Hay un futuro partido en dos 
De libertad, de amor, de amor 
Y amor de amor y amor de amor 

De andar y andar por el amor 
Me fui adentrando en su corazón 
Y en el fragor de decir no 
De nuevo veo que sale el sol 

Y gota a gota puede el sudor 
Armar de pronto la gran canción 
Que todo el pueblo como una voz 
En la alameda ya lo entonó, 
Liberación, liberación

Se fue de fuego no lo sentí

sin encontrar un Sol para sus sueños 
Pedro y María son dos sobreviviendo, 
navegan en un mar de indiferencia 
y cada nuevo día, un siglo entero

Pedro hoy día albañil ayer labriego, 
desgastado en las piedras y en los huesos 
llega al rincón de siempre detrás del beso 
que María le guarda al regreso.

Si se apagó tu alegría 
Y un mar sereno te conforma 

Por qué 
Te horrorizas cuando hablo 
Que el condón es necesario 
O llego un poco mareado 
Por qué 
Me condenas por mis años 
A vivir encapsulado 
Y sospechas de antemano 
Por qué no puedo 
Ser joven y alocado 
Sin terminar encarcelado 
Y la moral como jurado 

Por qué

Y me ayudas cuando caigo 
Sin infiernos como pago

This time the end was near
I'm fighting possibilities
I'll find at the end of my fear

Taking the final step tonight
Losing my breath just can't deny

Stand tall
I'm gone

Having all the cards in hand
Saving for that final bill

In that second I called my defeat
All the friends have lied
But at least I'm not strapped to my seat

Hey go away
Don't want you to stay

Hey go away

You slept when I was awake
It's me who rule the morning
Don't that just make you pissed

When you moved away
Moved away with a head full of shame
That's the way to play
At least when you're part of my game

Where creatures come and go
In search of souls
Inside
Your heart is empty but who looks

It's time, just close your eyes
Search, obey - baby feel my needs
Know the pain, as it hurts your soul
Fall you cunt - fall into place

You will now taste my hand



",In Search Of Souls
Illdisposed,"I'm one with the raindrops
But there's yet another sound
Now, could it be that Jeff
That fucking prick who you owe some money from the
From the bet that you lost to that fuck Jeff who works
Down the studio

Paranoia taken in
Temper rises paper thin
Evil lurks in every vein

Now it's time I kill again

See the real behind the lie
See the evil in my eyes
How good it feels I can't disguise

You're on your way to paradise

It wasn't the mailman
Yeah sure it was Jeff

He would not go away
So I stabbed his sick ass into quiet a mess
A mess it took me a while to disguise but now
There's no more Jeff
The fucking bastard's gone

What I used to say...
Won't leave the job half done

We'll take another round

We're about to land
And we've tightened our act

No more time for that mellow crap
About time you called in the boys

We put our feet down - touch the ground
And we make it last
Don't want to fight this round

You'll see another core
In which you'll trust
The boys are on the floor

No more time for that mellow way

We guarantee we'll stay

There is no other game
We want to play

We talked the nights away

Don't see a way out

But now we're history
Stories told in a playful kind of way
Too much too long and so it ends for us
I dread to think of what could have been

A year has gone
Just let it all be
This is the real me
It's what I've waited for

You were an angel
But you deceived me
This is where I get off
Here comes my stop now

Not for my eyes to see
For what I saw was another man
Embraced by your hand

High powers stare at my still face
The devil rocks tonight, the devil's in his place

You know the way I feel about these things, when I go down and
Lose the power to command
An ancient force of might play at my feelings and dare me to see
What went wrong in my life

You see me walking still sane
But in the dark I feel

Hell
I see the demons dance in vein
They're quite used to that

High powers led me to this maze
Evil took the time to set me up with fate

And my emotions try to rest for a while but in a second I'll be gone
For evermore
In life I never got to see what it's really like to live without the guilt
I never satisfied



",Still Sane

Pearls, wanted, my back turned here is the fight
Hate, wine, yeah - yeah

You scream at my wrongs
But yelling won't make it right
In time all you invoked
Was a game I played so right

Mind, hunger, now locked up every night
Try, feel - see things through my eyes
You - you made this hell, you really did
This is why I fell - when you

Screamed at my wrongs
Your yelling didn't succeed
In time all you gave
Was a game that tied my feet

They've stopped running now
And so have I

Count, shame - soon you'll feel me again
Endless, relentless - the word is revenge
Hurt, drugs, yeah - yeah
Honey - I owe you this much



",When You Scream

Is it the same? I bet it is
Still haven't found your peace?
Still on the edge? I bet you are

Come on man - What can you tell me

I wish I had a god damn life
But to say that would be wrong
Wish my life had just turned out
Better - but my weak is strong

So - will you stay there forever?
All in your grief? I bet you will
Or will you pull it together?
Is it a lie? I bet you can

Come on your fool, lets do it

I wish I could just let it go
But to do that would be hard
My friends will never ever know
How much I try for my part

It's you against the world
Or you against yourself

Rock - please let me guide you
Think it will work? I know it does
I mean we do this as one
Just take my hand I know you can

From childhood to manhood then comes the fat track
Showbiz & A.G., massive wreck we catch
From Dallas, Tex, to T-Next, then I'm back to the BX
Record on record, showstoppers don't knock us
And give out propers to the real hip-hoppers
Brand Nubians, Grand Puba, and BDP
The Hit Squad, the Lench Mob, the Flavor you-N-I-T
Greg Nice, Smooth B, Tribe Called Quest, Killa G
GangStarr, Ice Cube, of course D.I.T.C.
The whole flavor tour of 19 Naughty 3
Jamal and Malik is Illegal and the Kid Capri

1 to the 2 to the 3 (On the M-I-see!) [Repeat: x4]

[Malik]
Next up to flex, snapping necks, catching wreck
When I finish this flow, you'll regret that threat
Kicking rhymes at all times, with my brothers from the North
Never see me slipping, always ripping as they're falling off
Don't sleep on me or try to eat me up
Cause I'm raw, real rough and rugged rhymes on the regular
Where's your girl? Hold up, she's screaming cause I'm sticking her
Making this game come down, outta the hype
I got a call from Redman, he says ""Tonight's Da Night""
So Finesse bring the fat track and I'm sure to rock it
I'm living for hip-hop, I'm killing because of hip-hop
You can't write your own hits, get get stopped in hip-hop
Or drop, giving your rocks, sinking shots, off your feet
Cause the L-I-L M-A-L-I-K can't be beat
And A-B-C, ha, is easy as 1-2-3, yeah
As soon as the Lord on the beat, I couldn't even speak
Just wrote all night, so I can rip the mic
Like this and like that, and I never will come wack

We gettin' buzy on this track
Aye yo, check it

Malik'll play the lawnmower, and Kris'll play the grass
I just ate MC's, 'cause why? ABC whipped!
Illegal cuts that ass, the way that I will punch you
Wouldn't think I was a kid G, that's why I took the time out
To say that I gets buzy, like Dizzy, Gillespie
So suckers stretch your eyes, but you still couldn't see me
Now, skippidy-doo-dah, di-di-di da-di-day
I don't need no permission, I still come out and play
To Uncle Sam I say, ""Scram!"" Say my numbers aren't enough
But to get wreck with the army, all I have to be is rough
And tough, and no need to lie about my age
Just get fly with my tongue, and go on a rampage
I'm going off, because it's Little Malik
And no sucker, it's not all about maturity
Now if you want beef, fuck it, 'cause a fuss
And no, little kids, this ain't nothin' for Da Youngsta's
Ya can't even see me
It's no relation, so we can't run in the family
Yeah, and I'm still the boss
Cause I'm a straight up nigga, ain't nothin' bout me Kris Kross

I have the intellect to get respect, I'm gettin' wreck

You step out ?like the fuck in it? just like a pumpkin
Swingin' bolos, and buckin' buckshots
So when you look in the mirror, it be Illegal on your knots
So my advice to you is fade, stay out my way
Cause I'm a young bull on a rampage, I don't play
Jam that was a dope fiend, my rhymes and crews are fat
Check out my rhymes, and now check my gat
Because I'm always strapped pack with a loaded rhyme
And steppin' niggas get knocked off, from here to Zimbabwe, out
Cause I ain't havin' that shit, in ninety-three
Cause if you fuck with this shit, you gotta fuck with Malik, uh-huh

Und er sagte lieber Thomas,es ist lang noch nicht zu spät,
Ja,ich verrat dir ein Geheimnis von nem Freund,der ist Student,
Der trinkt nur Hopihalido und ist intelligent,
Laß die Finger vom Champagner,das Zeug macht dich nur blau,
Trink lieber kräftig Dosenbier,denn Dosenbier macht schlau.

Ich bin jeden Tag besoffen,kurz vorm Delirium,
Und ich kann eigentlich nur hoffen,mein Verstand bringt mich nicht um,

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,

End it all and let her go to some better man;

[Illogic]
I stand in the belly of oblivion
seeing light strobe past me, at uncomparable speeds of rushing wind
I take a step towards the laboreth of life
where it's pearly gates of white perplex me
I enter its doors of glittering ivory
and was met by streets of gleeming gold
that seem to lead into infinity
curious I took the road to an unknown destination
endured my down down the street of precious metal
with thoughts of confusion racing though my metnal
nevertheless I continued the journey
looking around I noticed crowds of clouds floating through this abyss of
beauty as if it were home
alone I proceed to watch for any signs of life
any signs that might give me a sense of my surroundings
then off in the distance I notice a glowing white figure
it would appear to be a platinum fountain gathering drink to her lips
as I pulled closer to this vision a set of wings grabbed my attention
to get closer, I had to, to check if this being was reality
the nearer I got, the realer she became
with flowing curly hair of a brownish brunette and
I take it she felt my presence as she turned my direction
aqua green eyes locked to mine
as the sites of a crossbow with its target
centuries of thoughts, epics of words were exchanged in this blare
stare is all that came to mind
at a loss of speech I, was standing in amazement

now is it possible that she, is it possible that we
is it possible that me, her, us, is inevitable
confrontation amazing, incredible, fabolous
though I'm human, her angelic
(if it wasn't love I wouldn't of felt it)

but its definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at first sight

her left appendix was extended to grace my face with the presence of her skin
the texture of her touch though of silk spun in the depths of Asia
her lips plump and sweet this being completely beautiful
from the root of her hair to the soul of her pedicure
still my muscles were stagnant(inactive)
I still handn't moved from the initial eyes locking so I appeared passive
shocking fact of how attractive being of the next world
to often I had to press girls to give me second look
but now I'm taken it was as if she saw into my soul and I, her's
its complexity had me perturbed(disturbed) that soceity's acceptance of her and I
but it seemed God was okay with it, he let our paths cross
still at a loss of words I strechd my arms just to touch her robe
to my knees I tossed, my body to worship this goddess of my resurrection
she had to be the closest thing to next to God himself
love like this never experienced before or ever will be again
she's my friend that shield me from the pain and anguish of living
never exchanged the word, our thoughts were from
the ""hello""'s to the ""how are you""'s to the ""I love you""'s
she grabbed my hands, led me to the land of milk and honey
life and prosperity, my wife she was preparing to be
we sat in a garden of roses and other, exotic flowers
still just exchanging thoughts as butterfly's landed on the tips of our noses
we held hands, her beauty was overwhelming I couldn't stand to stare
so I close my elids to rest of it
still she was there, I felt her gental touch to the chest
this heavenly voice spoke those three words, my heart began to race faster
felt the touch of those lips on my cheek, open my eyes to complete darkness
went for the lightswitch for illumination
wondering what type of twist or turn took my situation
to my surprise I was met by those eyes and that hair that stare, no wings
but it wasn't a dream, it was you my love
my earth angel, the real thing the real thing

I know now that she, I know now that we, me, her, us, in inevitable
confrontation amazing, incredible, fabolous
though I'm human, her angelic
if it wasn't love I wouldn't of felt it
but its definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at first sight",Angel

My favorite things include hip-hop crowds that ain't biased
Seein heads participate in real rhyme cyphers
Open mics with nobody spittin a written
Original MC's that love being different

[Illogic]
My favorite things include, open minds to open mics
and when I get open from rhymes that strike
Creativity's a plus, plus an MC that can crush without a cuss
and it's nice when a DOPE chick bust

[Blueprint]
My favorite is be	-girls that pop and lock
They're able to rock the spot, passers by that stop and jock
Cats that come to a hip-hop spot
without feelin the need to cop a glock and lick shots

[Illogic]
When a true MC spits raps composed of delicate prose on tracks
and when it's felt by the masses
Platinum respect lackin blunt ashes
Battle clashes from the top to drop any approachin amateur
When a challenger's up to caliber

[Blueprint]
MC's that shine without boastin
MC's that rhyme with the motion
Elevation without the high-postin
MC's that never lose touch and do they own street promotion

[Illogic]
When an MC's spirituality is the point focal
Minds bi-coastal, expandin beyond the local
And when I'm chillin with the pen and pad, fillin the lab with vocals
of melodic tunes that, reak of the underground perfume

[Blueprint]
When somebody I don't know gives me compliments
Seeing humbleness replace overconfidence
Hearin MC's that rap about the consequence
instead of glorifyin a lifestyle that lacks any type of common sense

[Illogic]
The lack of wack rhyme writin, and rhyme bitin
The ignitin of flames that fuel innovation
Tappin into the realm of concentration
to where the listener feels he's hopped dimension
Lyrics to make aliens stop and listen

[Blueprint]
The absence of yellin on my mixtapes
Any additional loops in my milk crates
Record shops where I cop all my beat breaks
Recordin every one of my verses on the very first take

[Illogic]
When the loop speed doesn't exceed 90
And to catch a line an MC must rewind me
To know my mom's behind me
That I make this my art, my culture, my release
My outlet by means through which I reveal the beast

[Blueprint]
When my EPS doesn't overheat
Rebootin and not lose an entire beat
When somebody want to diss or underrate me
I know this sounds strange, but it motivates me

Clutch the mic 'til it rust

I don't know what you thought you had or what you got
But yo, to be an MC it takes a lot
Are you willin to take the responsibility of this quest
cause if you do it right you might not have nothin left

[Illogic]
Yo, it takes artistic ability and knowhow lyrically
to express in forms of poetical wizardry
It takes rhythmic structures and phenomenal thoughts
It takes creation of hooks on which the wack can get caught
It takes knowledge of self and creator
It takes payin attention to that music in the elevator and elevatin
If you call yourself a lyrical surgeon it takes patients/patience
It takes takin a trip with God on that ship of relation
It takes self-denial AND realization
It takes keepin it realistic
Not real just to become a statistic
It takes evolution and edification
It takes a person, it takes a family, takes a city, it takes a nation
It takes surroundin sound, not lettin sound surround you
It takes surroundin yourself with fam and a dope crew
It takes hot tracks and it takes hot use of words
I don't about you but for me it took a third

[Chorus] - 2X

[Illogic]
Yo, it takes a sense of focus and clear mindstate
It takes shape and destiny and acceptin fate
It takes you takin a stand and not conceit
It takes you bein and actin like a man and not a beast
It takes squashin beef
It takes, treating our women like queens and men like kings
It takes replacement of material with spiritual things
It takes a one for education and lack of stupidity
It takes discovering your faults and seeking a remedy
It takes some illogical thinking in this rational world
It takes passiveness and confontation, rebellion and confirmation
It takes, an open and a closed mind
It takes a lack of compromise and, findin some truth in lies
It takes healin, it takes booze and it takes tryin
It takes winnin, it takes losin, it takes livin , it takes dyin
It takes them, it takes us, it takes you what takes me
These are the essentials I think it takes to be an MC

[Chorus] - 2X

I'm an MC cause I got what it takes
Are you an MC, do you have what it takes?

Illumina,"Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time",Good Night

Sogno allorizzonte
E mancan le parole
Si lo so che non c? luce
In una stanza
Quando manca il sole
Se non ci sei tu con me, con me.
Su le finestre
Mostra a tutti il mio cuore
Che hai acceso
Chiudi dentro me
La luce che
Hai incontrato per strada

When I'm alone I dream of the horizon and words fail me.
There is no light in a room where there is no sun
and there is no sun if you're not here with me, with me.
From every window unfurls my heart the heart that you have won.
Into me you've poured the light,
the light that you found by the side of the road.

Time to say goodbye.
Places that I've never seen or experienced with you.
Now I shall, I'll sail with you upon ships across the seas,
seas that exist no more,
it's time to say goodbye.

When you're far away I dream of the horizon and words fail me.
And of course I know that you're with me, with me.
You, my moon, you are with me.
My sun, you're here with me with me, with me, with me.

Time to say goodbye.
Places that I've never seen or experienced with you.
Now I shall, I'll sail with you upon ships across the seas,
seas that exist no more,


I'll revive them with you.

'Cause who wants to live forever?
Who wants to burn it down?
Down, down, down, down
And we can paint the town
'Cause who wants to sing the blues?
So some you win or some you lose
It's all a catch-22

Yeah, I could be getting old, but I'm getting round
Call it immature, sure, but hear me out
'Cause the only thing promised is the here and now
If we didn't live it up, never live it down, yeah
And when I jump I hold on, I'm like, ""oh my Lord""
If it all goes wrong then it's all my fault
Man, some just want to watch your world burn
But some on the straight and narrow lost first turn, so
Before you play, take a page of my own advice
It's all a game, know the price when you roll the dice
And what's the rush man? nowhere else to go tonight
And we ain't getting out on time, let alone alive
The choice is yours, your down for the cause
Be hated or adored, but never ignored
And whatever card you draw you can't win them all
So leave the sad songs at the door, get involved and

It's all a catch-22

Oh, you're not happy where you at heart, fuck it off then
Just make it not for nothing when you cut your losses
You haven't got it made, but you got your options
Ditch smokes for sleep, ditch shots for crossfit
What you tryna live longer? take a bow
What's the point of all those years if you spend them missing out?
Some of it's worth the risk, hoping you don't forget
Bad as the world can get none of it's permanent
So no politics or parties, even if
We solving world problems with our lager on our lips
And for all the easy ways out, the harder that it gets
Now isn't that ironic? no Alanis Morissette
We a hard act to follow, pouring the bottle
YOLO the motto, could all end tomorrow
Set your watch fast, stay ahead of your time
If you wait, might never arrive, that's the vibe so

Yeah
She gotta work out a play 'fore
She bail on her day job 'cause bae got
New orders to wait on
New Yorkers and ASOS
Spent years on her plans to ditch a plan
One spark went inside the avalanche
Whole world out there, she set to span
You can tell that by the Instagram
You gonna run the world someday
But someday can wait, it's not today
But that's okay, that's alright, you're well on your way

You don't know what you're missing
You don't know what you're missing

And the early bird hit its mark
So she gettin' dressed for work when it's dark
First in the class, first on the dance-floor
First sight, it works like a charm
New thing, she probably won't do that
In-between Girls and Orange Is the New Black
Hardly has time besides that
And the cocktails take her mind off the fact
There's a lot going on and she don't wanna deal
Stuck in the middle among all the feels
And a broke heart took all summer to heal
Don't need to say it, the struggle is real

(I know) And even when I get it
I don't (I don't)

Either we'll never get it right or it's meant to be

Ain't shy, let the whole world know
Haven't tuned in to the blow by blow
She move, I move, let her go, I go
Stir it up, stand back, watch a firework show
Ayo, too proud to quit when it's broken
Too in denial to admit when it's over
Drown in the separate ends of an ocean
Both in too deep to know where the coast is
Surrounded by waves and the hurricanes
Gaze, when we together ain't none of y'all safe

Up in smoke, down in flames 'cause man

Then it's RIP to the other days

You play with fire, your bridges get burnt, man
Standoff, only making this worse
But don't nobody move and nobody gets hurt, man

Sucker-punches traded, all fun and games
I dealt her cards, fall where they lay

Bad habits, don't knock it 'til you try it

I'ma do this 'til I'm gone, I'm gone broke, now

And goodbyes are love letters, written in her lipstick

Illy,"Seems like we grew up in a world
Where marketing's the reason you sell
So everybody's got a story
Or achievments to tell
These days seems everyone's repeating themselves
I'd change it but in truth it can't really be helped
Because what you about to do
Has been done one hundred times
Before you had thunk it
From Melbourne to London
Produces made beats before you could spell drumkits
Really how unique can you be I mean c'mon kid?
From the days of record stores
To the days of online message boards
It's all been said before
For ages I'd have sought inspiration
To create the same place where now you draw yours from
But your aim's to paint an image
But I know you ain't breaking limits
With the same (same) but different
It's like South Park when the Simpsons did it
I try to be one of a kind with my lyrics, but

Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you've heard this all before
I'm only one voice in a world of billions
And no idea's original no more
Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you've heard this all before
I'm only one voice in a world of billions
And no idea's original no more

Right I'm feeling like Jay
What more can I say
Only two albums deep
Like a quarter of the way
To the finish line
Some claim kick back give it time
Other's like hustle harder it'll slip by
So here it is
Conscious to the fact that the rhymes that I spat
In past times just might overlap
If they do dig deep and cope with that
Repetition is the father of learning
You're dead if you don't adapt
And I built it I'mma about it so I'mma still rep proud
Stick to my guns like the building's surounded
And bring the house down till they're kicking me out of it
Still have the freshest shit out on each album
Cause it's true no idea's original right
But a different perspective can give a new light
So I pull the pen out now I'm giving you mine
It's for you to press play sit back in the saab

Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you've heard this all before
I'm only one voice in a world of billions
And no idea's original no more
Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you've heard this all before
I'm only one voice in a world of billions
And no idea's original no more

I know you've heard this before
(One, two, three, four, four, three, two, one)

One mic
Two mic
Three mic
Four check it
Fine line between fine mic and broken records
Between recognising flaws and applause
Let's see what shit I can't tackle anymore
No momentary happiness or footprints in the sand
No pedal to the metal chase or cigarettes in hand
All good I'll get by
But I hope you understand
The same values I had
Still define who I am
I'm a hip hop boy
Leave the dubstep to club heads
I loose my shit to it
But ain't rapped on it once yet
It ain't me
Trends come and go
But at the time it got known
I'd already out grown it
I guess what I've learnt is my golden rule
Is the only thing that matters is the fans
That's who made this possible for me
So I'm responsible for you
It might not be the new
But nothing can beat truth

Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you've heard this all before
I'm only one voice in a world of billions
And no idea's original no more
Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar
I'm sure that you've heard this all before
I'm only one voice, ya I'm only one voice
But that voice speaks up for yours

Please forgive me if it all sounds so familiar

I'm a big city kid
Gone with the wind
Shoot from the hip
And all across the world, no difference
Every city in the world, at home within
Man, it could be nothing like the hard life
Shit, still a sucker for a skyline
The open road's fine to write a couple of lines
But the cities tell the story of a lifetime
Cut. Lights, camera, action
It's all that, everything you imagine
It's right there, you can reach out and grab it
Dreams turn reality big smoke magic
Maybe I'm biased, it may be the set up
Maybe it's just that I don't know no better
City don't sleep, speakers at eleven
If they got a question this is what I tell them (them, them, them)

Them city streets are endless
Them bright lights catch the eye
We push it to the limit
We build it to the sky
And anything can happen
So you do roll the dice
Hold tight and get ready to ride

I'm home, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight
Said, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight

Yeah, you could live the dream
Have it fall in your lap
Fall in love or fall through the cracks
Tough call to avoid those traps
But in high-stakes business you gonna get that
Take it from the streets to the penthouse suites
All you need is a dream, a belief
A little luck and a bit of guts to achieve
Heart of the city, belly of the beast
Yeah, what you pay for, cheap thrills ain't cheap
Pay a high price if you wanna taste free
All the good isn't always what it seems
But that's fine with me, this is where I wanna be
Amongst the bright lights and the beat of the city
In any direction people are with me
We get busy, what a trip, what a blessing
They wanna question so I tell them (them, them, them)

Them city streets are endless
Them bright lights catch the eye
We push it to the limit
We build it to the sky
And anything can happen
It's on you to roll the dice
Hold tight and get ready to ride

I'm home, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight
Said, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight
I'm home, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight
Said, I'm home and I'm one for the city tonight

'Till the lights come out
'Till the lights go down
And the sun comes up again
I'mma stay hard 'till the sun goes down

'Till the lights go down
And the sun comes up again
I'mma stay hard 'till the sun goes down
'Till the lights come out

And the sun comes up again
I'mma stay hard 'till the sun goes down
'Till the lights come out

Help me help you
I'm on the balance beam to keep you happy
Or say fuck it, stay mad at me
Know how that goes, drink, fight, patch things up in the back of a taxi
She can skate thin ice on wheels and not once get wet
She could walk five miles in heels not one foot out of step
And I swear I'll leave you swept, off your feet it's just our guess
I'm falling hard on myself here, yeah over my head

Fast learner, I figured out quick
With her it's not the getting it's the keeping
'Cause she's a gem, so everyone wants her shinning with them

Mind your step, keep it on your side of the fence
I play my demo's one last once
Smile if she likes it, laugh if it sucks!
Cold blooded, she the first in my corner
But now, what's that if it ain't called love
When it's all said and done, baby and happy 'till my heads spun
So I might get lucky
I might get none

Propongo honestidad 

Mi camisa cruzo la barrera de la realidad 
Llevo mi alma en la guantera, jamas me tengas 
Pena 
En caso de incendio rompa el cristal 
Yo soy el remisero de esta ciudad 

Remisero 

Y es que tengo un paraíso en el calendario 
Una virgen y una cruz me protegen a diario 
El miniturbo un hermano, combate el calvario 
Boxeo en la noche yo contra horario 

Necesito alguien que me haga brillar 
Necesito una linterna en esta oscuridad 
Soy el barón que se inclina por la velocidad 
Soy el remisero de esta ciudad 

Remisero 

Soy el remisero de esta nación 
El voto del ganado me convierte en dios 
En el asiento trasero me convierto en eros 
Llamarada de sexo directo a mataderos 

Yo se que soy muy sexy, deja tu monedero 
Kenny G en el stereo y todo será un sueño 
Estoy perfumado con fragancias a rosa 
Te leo mi cuento, te entierro mi morsa 
Yo llevo a las perras, las llevo a los cerros 
No piso a la gente que tiene cerebro 
Nací en la ruta de los claveles negros 
Manejo tu destino, manejo tu deseo

Ábreme tu cama, ábreme tu estrella

Adora mi perfume y descansa en 
Esta hoguera 

Mira que todo está quieto 
Mira que el sol está quieto 
Y buscas la venganza, sufres la venganza 
La muerte este allí tan lejos de aquí

Donde la luz es líquida y me provee de juicio

Que el cielo sea el único testigo de este encuentro

Hay que empezar a mover, se nos acaba la era
La luna pronto se ira, el sol vendrá con sus velas
Terremoto que en sus ojos siento
Se traslada a su cuerpo cuando está en movimiento
Estoy volando por su jungla dorada
Grita mi alma! es hora de empezar a mover
A mover el culo

Destinado a bailar ante dios
Como un río que fluye en celo hacia vos
Nuestra vida esta unida por un cordón umbilical de ritmo
Alterando el sentido de solo estar vivo

El hechizo corriendo por tus venas
Sientes la esencia la ciencia de tus piernas
Lámela hasta que grite dámela
Y empieza a entender de que se trata la vida

Su pollera explota en busca de mi sexo
Yo flotando en ella en mi mejor momento
Me muestra su volcán, su lava, su saliva
Me abre su puerta de entrada, no de salida

El mundo lo empieza a mover
El cielo se empieza a caer a tus pies
Nuevamente es tiempo de empezar a brillar
Otra vez grita mi alma!
Es hora de empezar a mover, girl you´re my love bouncing queen
Fuck the world, I can dream your eyes, all the way to coolo in paradise
A mover el culo",Cool-O [Remix Kuryakistan]

Veras que el cielo se nos abre 
Sos el camino hacia la luz 
Y ya no quiero preguntar 
En dónde te escondiste, amor 
Recoge el nácar de éste suelo 
Eso es el llanto mas mis sueños 
(que yo te quiero regalar) 
Y allá en lo alto amarás 
Un fuego de llamas plateadas 
Y ese calor nos cuidará 
Así lo siento yo

Donde estas 

Quiero que recojas una hermosa flor 
La misma que dejaste vos 
Que crezca fuerte 
Como tu hijo lo hace junto al Sol

Como abrazábamos la risa 
Viaje directo al infinito 
Imaginarme donde estas 
Pero no pudo evitar llorar 
Tengo en mi mente esta canción 
Que la escribieron tus amigos 
Y aunque tristeza en ellos hay 
Se que nos vamos a encontrar 
La guerra de galaxias continuar 
Asi lo siento yo

Donde estas quiero que recojas una hermosa flor 
La misma que dejaste vos 
Que crezca fuerte

Welcome to the jaguar house 
Lentamente fui entrando a la caja jaguar 
Los que duermen ya saben 
Que hay que despertar 
Un sueño y sus sombras saben que es real 

Un túnel dorado nos bautizara 
Welcome to the jaguar house 
Felina llaga, voz de mas allá

Mientras todo esto pasa, te veo a vos
Moviendo el culo en el verano que ya explotó

Nena, ya no veo nada

Árbol sangre verde que tu quieres podar 
Dame bendiciones, hay que despertar 
Chaco piel de indio, nunca morirás en el

Contigo desnudita 

Mis piernas son hierbas que sirven de enlace 
Pretendo atraparte y reírme en tu viaje 
Noche chaqueña luna plateada 
Lo nuestro se encuentra en una llamarada 

No fue tan cruel la mujer del guailo 
Cruzando el viento, quemo el horario 
Pidió perdón a los allí presentes 
Y dio su vida para que lo pienses 

Porque los guailos no entran al Chaco 
Porque tu guailo no entras al Chaco

Los niños comieron gracias a tu tesoro 
Propongo mi paladar para dar verdad 
La venda de tus ojos cayo y no volverá 
Hombre al presente planeas indignarlo 
Usando nuestras tierras tu basura iras creando

No dejes de respirar 
Abro bien mis ojos, escucho tu andar 
Ya no quiero más gritar 
Dios quemando el cielo
Arde nuestro hogar 

Destilando una nueva era 
Afilando la espada certera 
Como la ira del dragón 
Sobre estas tierras 
Fieras, escapando por terror a nuestro rango 
Tango, en la penumbra bailo tratando 
De escapar de mí 
Finalizando el pacto con mi sombra 
Parto como aladino en una alfombra 
Ya nadie nombra las bombas 
Dogmas explotan 
Pateas la nada en busca del todo 
Junto a bolo rodo 
Como un huracán de lodo

Y es inútil que entrenes tus trenes 
Aquí no tienen vía 
He visto a los leones cuidando nuestras vidas 
Te equivocas ante la mirada de la saga 
Tu golpe poco directo no hace nada nada 
Como chow yun fat mi cabeza chiva 
Tengo el estilo, la técnica para darte caída 
Cuando estés en el suelo 
Te brindaré la mano y un sueño 
Y si no eres leal 
Mil dragones pateando tu cuerpo 
Sabe, mi dolor es clandestino 
Como el contrato del cielo y el infierno 
Esta es la leyenda del tigre y el dragón 

Hey hermano, expedición al klama hama 

Mujer que me acompañas por las agujas del reloj 
Visión que me transporta riéndose del sol 
Pido perdón si asesino mis ánimos 
Hoy es el día herida, perdida está mi voz 
Amigo lento y veloz 
Sucede que despierto y lejos 
Y acompaño el manjar junto al arroz 
La cena se incendia día a día 
Sólo alimenta las desnutridas almas sin vida 
Librarás a las manos que quieran llegar 
Al lugar donde el agua se pueda besar 
Oirás, las palabras se fueron de allí 
Soñarás con un día poder despertar 
Caminar, encontrarte con la humanidad 
Llorarás, por lo que has visto y lo que verás 
Más allá, escuchaste a un niño callar 
Es su voz el recuerdo de lo que pasó

Estaba haciendo un demo con tu esposa y así alcanzo
El estrellato que la hizo feliz
Metiendo mi organismo para hacerla reír
Porque su esposo es cana
Y sus hijos en fila que me aplauden a mi
Porque tengo guitarra
Y porque suena así porque suena así!

Volando helicópteros en el jardín
Ellos me vigilan porque yo tengo un fin
Soy el encargado de arruinarte el festín si se me da la gana
Porque ando con ganas de un sonido anormal
Convertiré tu cama en un parlante animal
Escuchalo gemir baby!

Que toxica mami que sos
El perro se nos derritió
Es tiempo de tomar el control
Y comprar uno mejor que ladre por la libertad
Y que nos de una solución
Es tiempo de tomar el control
Y mover a esta nación

Porque ando con ganas de un sonido anormal
Convertiré tu cama en un parlante animal

Volando helicópteros en el jardín
La rosa que le clava su espina al jazmín
Corte tu ligustrina con forma de delfín
Así nada en mi cara
Si viene migraciones diles que ya me fui
Que tengo alambrado todo lo que te di
Que ya cruze frontera

Con una nota que decía dime un secreto
Y cuando te lo dije me tiraste un cross derecho
Caí medio mareado asombrado por los hechos
Saque la pistola pa dártela en las bolas
Pero escapaste por los techos gritando tu nombre
Puto el madafaka que entre los buenos se esconde

No se le nota que es un Madafaka

Tal vez, para nunca olvidarte
Aquí, soltaré tu mirada
Tendré, que volver a la nada
Despacio atravesemoslo
Por que sufrir si es desigual
Al sueño roto a la mitad
Lo entenderás al despertar
A otro cielo te veo llegar
Por eso sigue, sigue y nunca mires hacia atrás
Sigue, sigue olvida lo que te hace mal
Sigue, sigue y nunca digas nunca jamas

Será descifrar este juego
Y así nomás congelar el momento
Condenados a una historia sin tener final

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Les Moulins de Mon Coeur

First breath of air
I'm so aware of
New beginning

I've turned the page, a change came with the wind
It's not the end, it's a new beginning

And turned a bitterness to innocence I knew
The path was open to move on
Allow me to offer you my hand
Let me introduce myself again

Only to fall and burn one day
Do we shine, not knowing
Our own light

What is forever
When every sky shows
As soon as one light ?s out
Another one glows
All of us wonder where do we go
Is it dark, is it light, nobody really knows

When we wish upon a star
For our souls to meet again not far
Does it come true or is it just
A nursery rhyme
And when my time on earth is done
Is a shooting star what I become
Was an impression made, or do I just fade
From your mind

As soon as one light ?s out

And an evening breeze stopped by 
And brought some sweet relief 
In the silver light I finally let go of the heat

So we're tap dancing on a highwire
We could go tumbling down
But something makes me want to go higher
Think it's having you around

Now that we've touched, now that we've kissed
What does your heart say now
Now that it's come to this

Is it the same, or has something changed
Now that we've let our guards down
I just wanna know, what does your heart say now

We're just as much the forest, as we are the trees 
Every little seed trying to find 
Where the light comes from 

[Chorus]
And it's a world of hurt, nothing works 
It's a lonely little planet made of dust and dirt 
Who'd ever think that in the midst of all this 
Something as beautiful as love exists 
And when I hold you, and you hold me 
Heaven doesn't seem like such a mystery 
Darling in a world of hurt 
You make me feel so good 

Day one of our love, 
Two heartbroken people scared to trust too much 
Oh but here it comes that feelin' again 
That every lover swears will never end 
We thought we'd been there, done that, 
But when we kissed 
We knew we'd never been here,
We've never done this 
All the walls come tumblin' down 
When you love someone 

[Chorus]",World Of Hurt
Ilse DeLange,"I'd lived my life convinced I'd find
Your love somehow, some way
I held on to the faith that you
would show yourself one day
Something in me believed
This night was meant to be

[Chorus: ]
You are the promise I made to my heart
You are the vision I saw in the dark
You are the reason I waited so patiently
So many nights when I closed my eyes
It's you that I have seen
I am the dreamer
You are the dream

It wasn't always clear to see
Were I was headed to
But of all life's roads somehow I chose
The one that led to you
It doesn't matter how far I've been
I found my journey's end

In the morning when I wake
I am taken without warning
By the light in your face

Sometimes it scares me darling
This feeling of constant ache
As if you came much closer
My heart would surely break

It never ceases me to amaze me
When it`s said and done
After all this time when I am with you
I am always overcome

Used to feel like I was drifting
Always in and out of love
Ever since you`ve been with me
I can`t stand to leave you arms

It never ceases me to amaze me
When it`s said and done
After all this time when I am with you
I am always overcome

All this love
All these years
Made my life something real

If I had never found you
Don`t think I would believe
Love so strong could surround me
That I could lift me off my knees

Ilse DeLange,"The only thing that keeps me down is gravity
Without it I might fly around
Above life`s raging sea

You`ve let my spirit go
So I can be the untied melody
A song that rises
From my heart
Through these lips
Back to you

[Chorus:]
Beyond gravity, lifting me
Up above the clouds
And if ever we fall, we`ll come to rest
Above the raging sea
And beyond gravity

I`m a picture
Made of broken things
A fallen feathers from an angel`s wings
The shattered pieces of my past
Are held together like stained glass
And as your love shines through me
I reach out for the colours of you
So I can be, the untied melody
A song that rises
From my heart

Ilse DeLange,"What we have here is a misunderstanding
A lack of communication, what we have here is
Two people talking and nobody listening
Screaming and yelling things hard to take back

There's worse things than dying
When you've lost your reason for living
There's no point in fighting
When reasons for staying are missing

I'm leaving
There's something out there that I'm needing
There's more to life, there's got to be more to life
Than breathin'

There are still echoes of you and me laughing
Bouncing off walls of canyons in my mind
Stirring up memories of love long forgotten
How'd we let go of something like that

There's worse things than dying
When you've lost your reason for living
There's no point in fighting
When reasons for staying are missing

Putting back together hearts broke long ago

And's a bad thing to let go

There will always be lovers
With borders of their own
And you may charge across
In a golden chariot
But you will never be home

I had hope like a prayer unheard
Now this is nothing

When I got my first taste of you
You were just what I was lookin' for
And once I had a little I had to have more

'Cause I'd wake up moanin' in the middle of the night
The sound of your name was all that sounded right
Ran back to your door all soaked with sweat
Had to have your kiss before I starved to death

When you're livin' on love and it's all you need
A constant hunger that you've got to feed
Livin' on love and there ain't no doubt
It's the one thing you can't live without

You can have the world
But you still wouldn't have enough
None of that matters when you're livin' on love
Nothing else matters when you're livin' on love

Some folks just don't seem to understand
How I seem to survive on the touch of your hand
I don't need to eat, I don't need no rest
If I can get my fill of your tenderness

When I get wore down and feelin' rough
A long cool drink from your lovin' cup
Makes me feel better, makes me feel strong
Have mercy on me if I find you gone

With a kiss you'll wake to see

Take me by my hand, you'll know why

To not would be a crime, to wait would be a shame

Man you never compromise

Your torments and go on

I want to shelter you

There’s nowhere we can hide

Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made

Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth

You've got to love and adore and the rest is a lie
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me

I dime for advice,
That was you.

To prove that I was sane.

Left in a hurry.

Kiss on the cheek.

A game of cards was played
A knock on the door and entered in
A man of wealth in spades

Upon bending down a player saw
The stranger's feet were hooves

I was walking alone
And I was trying to find what I wanted to do with my life
So I know why you need to find a reason inside
For all the arguing and fights

You never want to be living a lie
You don't want to become all the things you despise

You need to believe
And follow your dreams
Follow the path that will lead your heart
Then you can find
The answers inside
They will be told by the voice of your heart

If they don't understand what it means to you
You don?t wanna lose your self-respect
When the shadows are closing in on you
I know that you aren't beaten yet

(Follow the voice, from your heart)
(Follow your dream, from the heart)

You are never alone there's no reason to hide
There are others who see from your eyes
And if you believe, if you stay with your drive
You'll keep your dream alive

Starts to coagulate

As my soul discorporates

Resurrected from the souls of the damned, comes the fury of their dismay

My soul now free to roam

I begin to seek what's been taunting me
My lifeless corpse no longer binding me

My incarnate life no more, my existence now deceased, now that I am gone I exist in misery. My unpleasant realization and my suffering begins, salvation never reached
And my kingdom never found.

I've sinned and sinned
I've sinned and I will again

You hypocrite, you never did

Your truths are lies
Your lies are so pathetic
I'll never give up my soul for you

One above, how mighty are your wonders
Your kingdom is everlasting, yet so empty
Your saints have chosen sin over glory
Your strength has diminished, my fallen one

Clearly you'll see how it unfolds
Brought down from above to see how it is

Don't you feel passion
Don't you know love

Down with the leaders who rape their own men
Down with your idols, down with your ideals
Down with the thieves who rob us of life

Fortress to fortress with no ground to gain
On missions of hatred that lead us to ruin
A course that would change if we bring them down

Immolation,"The kingdom falls and with it goes the darkness of the world
It's malignant soul had burned so bright in the glory of it's day
Wars were fought in it's name and life was cast aside
So many lives were sacrificed to keep the kingdom strong

The kingdom falls and with it goes the shadow that it cast It's king alone, to stand in shame, a symbol of the past
The pulse that beat for centuries had died out long ago
And now divided the people see the truth behind the show

Watch them scramble for cover
Watch them try to hold it together
Frantic to stop it's collapse
But change has finally come

Divided it will fall
It's fabric rips and tears
The beating of it's heart
Will never again be heard

Foundation built on the flesh of the past
Twisting it's purpose through years of neglect
Conflict of power, true soldiers are scarce
A kingdom divided will not stand

The kingdom falls and with it goes the arrogance it reeked The darkness that was hidden deep now on the surface flows
Humbled now before the world it shows its ugly face
Tear this cancer from the world and purge it from our lives",A Kingdom Divided
Immolation,"Burdened by the world, too weak to deal with life 
Bow to show your love, bow to show devotion 
Drowning in the sickness that vomits forth deceit 
Fear not what is said, but fear what you believe 

Ravaged by their words and into their open arms 
Like thieves they'll steal your mind and use it to control 
An endless sea of faces, an endless sea of loss 
Take your place in line and serve them until the end 

Do you think you follow greatness 
Do you think you follow the divine 

Do you think you are the chose 
Do you think you are the few 

A genocide of faith 
The faithful wait their turn 

Just like slaves...hand in hand 
Just like ghosts...souls in hand 

You take their lives 
You take our hearts 
You have no shame 

You shake the world 
Dramatic stage 
For your own gain 

You say you're men 
We know you're cowards 
You pitiful fools 
The true strong remain 

Just like slaves...hand in hand 
Just like ghosts...now you're damned

The signs you won't leave, we still seem to find

Such distance between us, but we know you are here
We feel your presence, it guides us along
But why won't you answer or send us some hope
We'll just keep searching for what we know is there

Why has our day not yet come
We've sacrificed our fathers and sons
We spill blood but shed not a tear
Our anger grows, but so does our fear

Can you feel it closing in?

And one by one we’ll fall, giants side by side
And one by one we’ll fall, the irony of our end

Rage of silence builds
A calm that’s so deceitful
We’re our own prey
Watching the night fall
We can not stop this
It pulls us under
The tides now turning
Poised to strike us down

And one by one we’ll fall, we’ll slowly disappear
And one by one we’ll fall, our darkest day draws near

We had it in our hands; we thought we had the power
But control was an illusion that finally defied us
Took it all for granted, too little was too late
Finally catching up to us, grandeur has a heavy cost

Burn the world around us, incinerate the skies
Fading into nothing, but what did we expect?
Now the final fury of our final hopes
In awe of what we’ve done, so beautiful to watch",At Mourning's Twilight [DVD]
Immortal,"Aeons ago the legends tell we rode onward
Led astray by the northern chaos gods
Calm before the storm we came from the north...
Horses roamed in the open landscaped

The scald sang to their kings
Only he who battle wins
The scald sang to their kings
Let the battle he fought to the won

Tremble with fear for the banner of our kings
War now calls heed to the battle
Hear our swords clinging in the wind
Men cast from their saddles horses roar and scream
Descendants of wrath and the kingdoms of fear...
The might we possess burn like fire
The will remain in our northern hearts...
More scalps to be won - an eye for an eye

Aeons ago the legends tell we rode onward
Led astray by the northern chaos gods
One by one by the northern tribe you fall
One by one... die by the strongest of them all
Still there's only greatness sunged in those who fell
Who battled strong to win these wars...
One by one we took your lives

Grey mist swirl across the meadows...
Where battles once ruled the steps
Where the ancient armours of bronce
Are buried and corrored by time
Strong where those who won the war...
And the legends tell only of wrath
As brothers of the northern tribes...
They guarded the horders of chaos
We leave this Battlefields ground
Red where the rivers of blood
Unforgotten by the ones...
Born of strength and glory",One by One

Immortal Technique,"I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
His primary concern, was making a million
Being the illest hustler, that the world ever seen
He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams
A corrupted young mind, at the age of thirteen
Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend
She put the pipe down, but every year she was sober
Her sons heart simultaneously grew colder
He started hanging out selling bags in the projects
Checking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects
He was fascinated by material objects
But he understood money never bought respect
He build a reputation 'cause he could hustle and steal
But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal
So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
You see me and niggas like this have never been equal
I don't project my insecurities at other people
He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential
The product of a ghetto breed capitalistic mental
Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
Dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
But he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed

Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
Devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot

So Billy started robbing niggas, anything he could do
To get his respect back, in the eyes of his crew
Starting fights over little shit, up on the block
Stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock
Working overtime for making money for the crack spot
Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine
Fulfilling the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
Tired of the block niggas treating him the same
He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love
They told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs
Any bitch nigga with a gun, can bust slugs
Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood
Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in a club
But only a real thug can stab someone till they die
Standing in front of them, starring straight into their eyes
Billy realized that these men were well guarded
And they wanted to test him, before business started
Suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted
So now he had a choice between going back to his life
Or making money with made men, up in the cyph'
His dreams about cars and ice, made him agree
A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three

Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
Devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot

They drove around the projects slow while it was raining
Smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment
Until they saw a woman on the street walking alone
Three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home
And so they quietly got out the car and followed her
Walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her
They wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor
This is it kid now you got your chance to be raw
So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair
And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
She struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs
They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
Screaming shut the fuck up and stop moving around
The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed
So Billy stomped on the bitch, until he had broken her jaw
The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing
They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving
Blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently
And then they all proceeded to rape her violently
Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn
Ripping her up, and choking her until her throat burned
A broken jaw mumbled for God but they weren't concerned
When they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and bruised
One of them niggas pulled out a brand new twenty-two
They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through
And if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead
And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head

I'm falling and I can't turn back
I'm falling and I can't turn back

Right before he pulled the trigger, and ended her life
He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice
And he felt strong standing along with his new brothers
Cocked the gat to her head, and pulled back the shirt cover
But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter
Cause he was starring into the eyes of his own mother
She looked back at him and cried, cause he had forsaken her
She cried more painfully, than when they were raping her
His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate
His corruption had successfully changed his fate
And he remembered how his mom used to come home late
Working hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth
He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
And crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared
But only the devil responded, cause God wasn't there
And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
They say death takes you to a better place but I doubt it
After that they killed his mother, and never spoke about it
And listen cause the story that I'm telling is true
Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom too
And now the devil follows me everywhere that I go
In fact I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows
And every street cypher listening to little thugs flow
He could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know
The devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked
White, brown, yellow and black colored is not restricted
You have a self destructive destiny when your inflicted
And you'll be one of Gods children and fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
So when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
Because the dance with the devil might last you forever",Dance With the Devil

It's on now mother fucker
Lock and load!

This is the point of no return I could never go back
Life without parole up state shackled and trapped
Living in the hole, lookin' at the world through a crack
But fuck that, I'd rather shoot it out and get clapped
I've gone too far, there ain't no coming back for me
Auschwitz gas chamber full of Zyklon-be
Just like the Spanish exterminating Tynos
Raping the black and Indian women, creating Latinos
Mother fuckers made me out of self righteous hatred
And you got yourself a virus, stuck in the Matrix
A suicide bomber strapped and ready to blow
Lethal injection strapped down ready to go
Don't you understand they'll never let me live out in peace
Concrete jungle, guerrilla war out in the streets
Nat Turner with the sickle pitch fork and ma chatte
The end of the world, mother fucker you not ready
This is the point of no return and nobody can stop it
Malcolm little running up before Elijah Muhammad
The commedent killed the dinosaurs, changing the earth
They love to criticize they always say I change for the worse
Like prescription pills when you miss using them nigga
The temple of nights when they took Jerusalem nigga
And figured out what was buried under Solomon's temple
Al Aksa the name is no coincidental
I know too much to government is trying to murder me
No coming back like cutting your writs open vertically
How could the serpent be purposely put in charge of the country
Genetic engineered sickness spread amongst me
My people are so hungry that they attack without reason
Like a fuckin' dog ripping off the hand that feeds him
Immortal Technique is treason to the patriot act
So come and get me mother fucker cause I'm not coming back

This is the point from which I could never return
And if I back down now then forever I burn
This is the point from which I could never retreat
'Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die and succeed
Living the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on it can never be the same as before
'Cause the place I'm from doesn't exist anymore

This is the point of no return nigga you better believe this
Mary Magdalen giving birth to the children of Jesus
The evolution of the world, bloody and dramatic
Human beings killing monkeys to conquer the planet
The kingdoms of Africa and Mesopotamia
Machine gunnin' your body with depleted uranium
This is the age of micro chips and titanium
The dark side of the moon and contact with aliens
I started out like Australians, criminal minded
Broke into hell, tore it down, and built and city behind it
South Paul, murderous, methodology nigga
Remember that I'm just a man don't follow me nigga
'Cause once you past the point you can never go home
You've got to face the possibility of dying alone
So tell me mother fucker, how could you die for the throne?
When you don't even got the fuckin' heart to die for your own
It rains acid, one day the earth will cry from a stone
And you'll be lookin' at the world livin' inside of a dome
Comperized humanity living inside of a clone
This is the place where the unknown is living and real
Worm went to planet X and the seventh seal
Universal truth is not measure in mass appeal
This is the last time that I kneel and pray to the sky
Cause almost everything that I was always ever told was a lie

This is the point from which I could never return
And if I back down now then forever I burn
This is the point from which I could never retreat
'Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die and succeed
Living the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on it can never be the same as before

And now we enterprise the aftermath, one in the same
Living the revolution 'till we catch one in the brain
And even then my spirit will return in heavenly form
And wipe the chess board clean, of my enemies pawns
The red don communist threat, burried and gone
So they invented a war, the government can carry on
It makes me wonder if the word of god is lost in the man
This is for the children of Iraq, lost in the sand
This is for the illest emcees that'll never be known
And this is for all the soldiers that'll never come home
I wrote this for Momia, stuck in a beast
For people who, march in the streets, and struggle for peace
For hood niggaz, born rugged, never rocking Versace
Eddie Ramierez's cousin George, and my old friend Sashi
Chris from the block, and all my niggaz stuck in a cell
Paul Wolfowitz, motherfucker I'll see you in hell
My destiny is to show the world, that the music is real
Go back in time and play this shit, for the slaves in the field
And for my children in the future, waiting to breathe
People slowly dying hanging on, waiting to leave
Believe when I'm gone, and this album's on a library shelf
I'll be one with god and one with you and everything else

[Hook]

[Immotal Technique talking]
Yeah..
Revolutionary Volume 2 has been brought to you
By the type of motherfuckers who ain't scared of shit
And if you playing this album, and I'm no longer here
And sometime far away from when I recorded this
Remember that history
Isn't the way the corperate controlled media made it look like
Read between the lines and free your mind
Revolution is the birth of equality
And the anti-thesis to oppression
But this is only built for real motherfuckers
So when I'm gone, don't let nobody I never got along with
Try to make songs kissing my ass, recycling my beats or my vocals
The shit is real over here man
Thank you for listening, and thank you for supporting independent Hip Hop
The heart and soul of our culture
Keeping the truth alive
Goodnight my people.. goodnight..

[Intro: from the film ""Scarface""]


Host: I've heard whispers about the financial support
your government receives from the drug industry.

Guest: Well, the irony of this, of course, is that
this money, which is in the billions, is coming from
your country. You see, you are the major purchaser of
our national product, which is of course cocaine.

Host: On one hand, you're saying the United States
government is spending millions of dollars to
eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the
same time, we are doing business with the very same
government that is flooding our streets with cocaine.

Guest: Mmm-hmm, si, si. Let me show you a few other
characters that are involved in this tragic comedy.

[Beat starts]

*Two Men Speak in Spanish*

[Immortal Technique - Worker]
I'm on the border of Bolivia, working for pennies
Treated like a slave, the coke fields have to be ready
The spirit of my people is starving, broken and sweaty
Dreaming about revolution (REVOLUTION!) looking at my machete
But the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms
And if I ran away, I know they'd probably murder my moms
So I pray to ""Heso Preisto"" when I go to the mission
Process the cocaine, paced and play my position

[Pumpkinhead - Cocaine Field Boss]
Ok, listen while I'm out there, just give me my product
Before we chop off ya hands for worker's misconduct
I got the power to shoot a copper, and not get charged
And it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad
So to feed your kids, I need these bricks
40 tons in total, let me test it, indeed I (*sniff*)
Shit, this is good, pass me a tissue
And don't worry about them, I paid off the officials

[Diabolic - Peruvian Leader]
Yo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of some of the foulest
Elected by my people...the only one on the ballot
Born and bred to consult with feds, I laugh at fate
And assassinate my predecessor to have his place
In a third-world fashion state, lock the nation
With 90% of the wealth in 10% of the population
The Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully
The finest type of China white and cocaine you'll see

[Tonedeff - American Drug Distributor]
Honey I'm home, nevermind why our bank account's suddenly grown
It's funny, we're so out of this debt from this money we owe
Woulda ya...mind if I told you I had two governments overthrown
To keep our son enrolled in a private school, and to keep ya tummy swollen
c'mon, our fuckin' home was built on the foundation of bloody throats
The hungry stolen of they souls, of course this country's runnin' coke
I took a stunted oath to hush the one's who know
But CIA conducts the flow of these young hustlers who lust for dough

[Poison Pen - Drug Dealer]
I don't work in the hood (Hit my connect)
Plus what's really good, they supply for the hood
These dudes fucking crack me up, scrutinize like we inferior
Petrified when we meet in my area (calm down)
My dude's'll shoot until I say so, got the loot? 
Give me the YAY YAY like Ice Cube, so don't play with my llello
We won't stop for you bastards
Must choose (?), chop it and bag it

[Loucipher - Undercover Police Officer]
Taking pictures and tapping phones 
Debating snitches and cracking codes
Past a couple, blast the fo', 
Want any hustler stacking dough with probably crack the blow
And my overtime is where your taxes go
I gain your trust
Get you to hand weight to us because we paid up front
On the low with cameras taping ya
Getting pop away? The prison sentence is going to
Make the officer leave with two ki's out the evidence room

[C-Rayz Walz - Prison Inmate]
Out the evidence room (*Said with Loucipher*)
Went my fame, truck, boat or plane, they watching you
You think you got work? They copping too
We control blocks, they lock countries
Ya own companies, we had nice cars and sneaker money
Now there's players out there, talking 'bout the holding
With bugs in they house like they down South with windows open
Your dough ain't long, you wrong, you take shorts and (?)
Feds will be up in your mouth...like forks and spoons
So enjoy the rush, live plush off Coke bread
Soon you'll be in a cell with me, like Jenny Lopez
In school, I was a bully, now life is fully a joke
I keep a flow on a boat for Peruvian Coke
Players do favors for governers and tax makers
Fat Quakers smoke crack and sex acts with bad mayors
The walls got ears, you big mouths probably scared
Not prepared to do years like Javier

[Immortal Technique Speaking] 
The story just told is an example of the path that
drugs take on their way to every neighborhood, in
every state of this country. It's a lot deeper than
the niggas on your block. So when they point the
finger at you, brother men, this is what you've got to tell them:

[Wesley Snipes - from ""New Jack City""]
I'm not guilty. YOU'RE the one that's guilty. The
lawmakers, the politicians, the Columbian drug lords,
all you who lobby against making drugs legal. Just
like you did with alcohol during the prohibition.
You're the one who's guilty. I mean, c'mon, let's kick
the ballistics here: Ain't no Uzi's made in Harlem.
Not one of us in here owns a poppy field. This thing
is bigger than (Immortal Technique). This is big
business. This is the American way.",Peruvian Cocaine

",Revolutionary (Intro)
Immortal Technique,"Immortal Technique and DJ Green Lantern
Third world mother fuckers!

I'm from where the gold and diamonds are ripped from the earth
Right next to the slave castles where the water is cursed
From where police brutality's not half as nice
And makes the hood in America look like paradise

Compared to the AIDS-infested Caribbean slum
African streets where the passport's an a American gun
From where they massacre people and try to keep it quiet
And spend the next 25 years tryin' to deny it

I'm from where they cut your hands off if you make a fist
And niggas throw 'coca cause the job market doesn't exist
Except slave labor modern day company store
And peace keeper's don't ever, ever come here no more

From where the bombs that they used to drop on Vietnam
Kill us children born deformed eight months before they born
I'm from where they lost the true meaning of the Qur'an
'Cause heroin is not compatible with Islam

And niggas know that, but throw that poppy seed anyway
'Cause that food dropped parachute does not come everyday
I'm from where people pray to the gods of their conquerors and practically
Every presidential a money launderer

From where the only place democracy is acceptable
Is if America candidate is electable
And they might even have a black president, but he's useless
'Cause he does not control the economy stupid!

Lock and load your gun, where I'm from, the Third World son
Been to many places but I'm Third world-born
Guerrillas hit and run where I'm from: the Third World son
You polluted everything, and now the Third World's gone
The waters poisoned where I'm from son
Seven hundred children die by the end 'this song
Revolution will come, where I'm from: the Third World son
Constant occupation, leaves the Third World torn

I'm from where the catholic churches are some racist shit
They helped Europe and America rape this bitch
They pray to white Spaniard Jesus, who's face is this
But never talk about the black Pope Gelasius

I'm from where Soviet weapons still decide elections
Military is like the Mafia, you pay for protection
Catamite, sex tours, is what the country sells
And rich white businessmen make the best clientèle

I'm from where they too pussy to come film Survivor
And they murder Coca-Cola union organizers
I'm from where the justice system esta podrido
Fuck government niggas, politic over perico

(Spanish)

Cause Rico laws don't apply to the CIA
And mother fuckers make sneakers for a quarter a day
I'm from where they overthrow democratic leaders
Not for the people but for the Wall Street Journal readers

From where blacks, indigenous peoples and Asians, were once
Slaves of the Caucasians and it's amazing how they trained them
To be racist against themselves in a place they were raised in
And you kept us caged in

Destroyed our culture and said that you civilized us
Raped our woman and when we were born you despised us
Gentrified us, agent provocateur divide us
And crucified every revolutionary messiah

So I'm a start a global riot
That not even your fake
Anti-communist dictators can keep quiet
Fuck your charity medicine, try to murder me
The immunizations you gave us were full of mercury

So now I see the Third World like the rap game soldier
Nationalize the industry and take it over!

Lock and load your gun, where I'm from, the Third World son
Been to many places but I'm Third world-born
Guerrillas hit and run where I'm from: the Third World son
You polluted everything, and now the Third World's gone
The waters poisoned where I'm from son
Seven hundred children die by the end 'this song
Revolution will come, where I'm from: the Third World son
Constant occupation, leaves the Third World torn",The 3rd World
Immortal Technique,"This is an invasion
An occupation
Immortal Technique
The evil genius DJ Green Lantern
And you're now understanding guerrilla warfare
Is being spread by the superpowers of the industry
To the third world underground of the streets

This is for all those who have been labeled extremists
Maniacs, terrorists, shit
Welcome to the third world

Invasion, a ramp of monetary inflation
That brought us all to the footsteps of this nation
Peruvians, Haitians, Ecuadorians
Nicaraguans, Colombians, Salvadorians

They call us terrorists after they ruined our countries
Funding right wing, paramilitary monkeys
Torture the populaces, then blame the communists
Your lies are too obvious, propaganda monotonous
And that's not socialist mythology
This is urban warfare, to the streets of your psychology
So I'm like the legs of a paraplegic really
'Cuz I'm still part of you, even if you can't feel me.

You can never debate me, the M4's at your baby
Like troops and gats in Iraq do daily
So you can marginalize the way you portray me
But don't get Hollywood and try to play me
We could shoot it out in a dinner, like juice in the 80's
New jack city, classic crack mack villian
Shouting BET mount black on the Rap City

You got a contract to kill me, motherfucker that's fine
'Cuz there's a contract to kill your family when I die
So when your car explodes, don't be surprised
Soldier, I'm like marine core C4, even blow this spot with the beat rocking at 3,4
Canvas the flow, like the ghost of Michaelangelo
This is the anthem, Immortal Technique and Green lantern
Don't say shit bitch, you don't want the che che to come and fft
You know what I sick with, lyrical tuberculosis
Cocaine overdoses, blood come out your noses
That's when death approaches
March to my death, smiling
Laugh at the M's viling
There's no escape from this political asylum

Revolutionaries don't fear execution
Cuz the death of my (? )is a good constitution
It's just the beginning of spiritual evolution
God will reincarnate me as revolution

You can't take out a revolution
You can't kill an idea
Fuck, is you stupid?
You kill that man
He becomes immortal

Ignore the triplets
This is a fully loaded four four
Third world underground hardcore
Street hop locked and loaded
Motherfucker you should know it
Flash the door to the game
Open it overthrow it",Death March
Immortal Technique,"Harlem once was red line district rated
Designated ghetto like the yellow star of David
And you wonder why people don't own their homes
'Cause the racist bank wouldn't fuckin' mortgage a loan

Until after the invasion of gentrification
Eminent domain intimidation
That's not negotiation
And it's frustrating to look at every day
Like watching a porno on 56K
Biohazard labs instead of storerooms
What's next motherfucker projects as dorm rooms
You ain't fooling nobody in this community dude
With your little fake Manhattanville community group
Ivy league real estate firms are corrupt
They lay siege to your castle like the Moors in Europe
They treat street vendors like criminal riff raff
While politicians get the corporate kickbacks

[Chorus: ]
Harlem Renaissance a revolution betrayed
Modern day slaves thinking that the ghetto is saved
'Til they start deporting people off the property
Ethnically cleaning the hood, economically
They want to kill the real Harlem Renaissance
Trying to put the Virgin Mary through an early menopause
The Savior is a metaphor for how we set it off
Guerilla war against the rezoning predators

When I speak about Harlem, I speak to the world
The little Afghan boy and the Bosnian girl
The African in Sudan, the people of Kurdistan
The third world American indigenous man
Palestinians, Washington Heights, Dominicans
Displaced New Orleans citizens
Beachfront Brazilian favelas that you livin' in
The hood is prime real estate they want back in again
I didn't write this to talk shit, I say it because
Some of y'all forgot what the Harlem Renaissance was
We had revolution, music and artisans
But the movement was still fucked up like Parkinson's
'Cause while we were giving birth to the culture we love
Prejudice kept our own people out of the club
Only colored celebrities in the party
And left us a legacy of false superiority
W.E.B. Du Bois verses Marcus Garvey
And we ended up selling out to everybody
The Dutch soldiers and the John Gotti's
Bankers ? modern day gangsters, a mobile army
They want to move us all out the NYC
Like they did to the Jews with the Alhambra Decree
So support your own businesses and do the knowledge
'Cause the real Harlem Renaissance is economic

You ain't got the right to bear arms, huh?
Sometimes you might have to brandish a motherfuckin firearm
(Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots)

[Chorus: Immortal Technique]
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots
Lick shots for the revolution
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots
But watch, where the fuck you shootin
Yo where you aimin at? Where you aimin at?
Where the fuck you niggaz aimin at?
Where you aimin at? Where you aimin at?
This is only for the hardcore wherever you at, yeah

[Immortal Technique]
Random one cop killa, hip-hop has never been realer
Volume 2 shot up the president like a gorilla
New York police state capital tried to swallow me
Locked me longer than Puerto Rico been a colony
Thirteenth Amendment slavery property
And now they signin rappers that promote their philosophy?
Fuck that, nigga hip-hop is not Republican
That's just the white motherfuckers that own the publishin
And get the fuck out, if you want the foreigners gone
I paint the White House black and park my car on the lawn
Marry a Muslum girl and fuck her five times a day (WHAT?)
Every time right before we shower and pray (HA!)
You damn right the AK, symbolizes Jihad
But a holy war, is a conversation with God
You bitch niggaz misinterpret what you don't understand
Stackin the wrong sign can end up, shootin your man
Shootin each other, shootin your brother
Aim the gun at the right motherfucker
And leave him colder than the prison in Russia
Or America's white power structure
Niggaz love to say ""Fuck revolution!""
Until the jury comin and move for the prosecution
And them brothers act like a born-again Huey Newton
Forgot about the bullshit music they was producin
But my niggaz aim precisely, through the confusion - AND

[Crooked.I]
I got a hundred shooters with me, Rugers shoot you through the kidney
Stand in front of the judge and lie quicker than Scooter Libby
I'm runnin through the city - dear God
If I murk the racist Rush Limbaugh I wonder would you forgive me? (Huh?)
Somebody told me glim back as the plan's over
See ya, time to let him see a damn soldier
Flip your Landrover, I told ya I blam toasters
Gun pop off like the mouth of Ann Coulter
This is my gangsta religion
See I aim with precision, point blank the position
I'm black as them ancient Egyptians
Before European historians went and changed the description
I'm blamed for the 'caine in the kitchen
The C.I.A. playin with the pigeons, same pain that I'm pitchin (yea)
Listen, you dudes better watch the hook
I'm a boxer, coppers'll come up, Hoffa look
They wanna get rid of this conscious crook
Like I'm a Gnostic, apocryphal, non-canonical Gospel book
But I ain't goin nowhere, that's the motherfuckin truth
America don't care for its inner city youth - so I

Yo, XL eternal my journal, Sojourner, Nat Turner
Cop murdered by the certain burner turned in the back of his sternum
He flirted with pullin me over for bein brown, I bust
Now he in the back of the truck with Don Imus
I must, take aim when I lick shots
Throw stray bullets like when Nas got off of Pharoahe Monch
These pigs wanna see us dead inside a jail cell
Turn us from Shawn Carter to Shawn Combs to Sean Bell
My temper 'bout to break like levees in New Orleans
Catch Jimmy Iovine when he refinance his mortgages
Kid illusion is dead, we movin with the blue and the red
Latin Kings, Giuliani with a gat to his head
Y'all don't lick shots like killers aimin at the Feds
Y'all lick shots like Jenna Jameson and Superhead
Pigs slice to Venice and beef at the benefits meet
Buried him on Venice Beach with the flies and the bees

Fuckin' up our lives
I'll take a piss in your oil fields
I want some motherfuckin' payback so, yo

I wanna run for president, and the focal point when I'm campaigning
Is to put FEMA to work on a plantation at Camp David
Demand payment for New Orleans with the best of swordsmen
Launching missiles at the White House while Tech's performing
On the lawn and I just let 'em burn till death's confirmed
Laid to rest with worms cause otherwise they'll never learn
I'll form a cruel intent, put anthrax through the vents
From out a package I got in the mail that you just sent
But I got a better punishment for these Republicans
I'd let 'em live so they can see us overthrow the government
Let's fuck with them, have the first lady beat me off
Till my semen's launched, then I skeet across her face like Peter North
And I won't leave a doubt what we about when I cream her mouth
Or leave her trout bleeding out on Condoleezza's couch
I'll seek this route without regrets, and drink a brew then think of you
Cause if it's the last fuckin' thing I do I'll

Nigga, I never forget nothing nigga

Fifty-one percent of the World Bank is owned by the U-S treasury
Robbing third world countries out all they resources and equity
When Afghanistan was fighting the Russians
Reagan and Bush gave Bin Laden weapons and told him get to bussin'
We even called 'em freedom fighters
Financed the cost with CIA imported cocaine
That whole Iran Contra Scandal, niggas took the blame
Started a war on drugs
Meanwhile Russia's defeated, America thinks more oil for us
Take over, set up a public government, Arabs ain't bearing it
So the same freedom fighters, George W. call 'em terrorists
Poetic justice, payback's a bitch, these fuckin hypocrites
Like Bill O'Reilly, right-wingers deserve what they get
Rush Limbaugh, drug addict, Giuliani, sex scandal
I wanna thank white supremacists then show you how my tech's handled
My neck's nano-technologically designed
It spits SARS to all you stupid ass execs that capital resigned

I am vindictive, faggots!

Huh, ha ha ha
Yeah I got something for you motherfuckers ha ha
You want it? Here you go!

The first payback that I would accomplish
I'd draft children from the senate and congress
Pompous religious right made suicidal
When I exposed Joe Cephas for ghost writing the Bible
Making nuclear silos, bomb the world with hydro
Chinese dragon sized blunts in Maracaibo
Huh, and everyone flashing a gun on a D-V-D
I'd make them niggas shoot it out with N-Y-P-D
And every fucker that didn't buy my C-D
I'd stab the revolution in their neck with an I-V
See me, own the world, I'd give it back to the poor
I'd give a last name to every single son of a whore
Hard to the core, fuck with the gay list
Niggas pop on they block but they globally nameless
I'd show the hood real gangsters and make 'em famous
Langley Virginia, where my connect for cocaine is
I'd make everybody fuckin' have the world darkening
I make rap-about lyrics, not beats and marketing
Replace every raped virgin's broken hymen
Holding De Beers reclining, while they choke on they diamonds
My designing's like Francis Ford Coppola rhyming
Building a universe inside solitary confinement
I'd reverse Rockefeller laws and bring Mumia home
And serve the President free styling off a the dome

A message to the outgoing president
Hey I got a great idea nigga
Kill yourself
Ha ha ha, you know it's so funny, 
I thought about it the other day
You should probably kill yourself
Ah why don't you kill yourself?

Get his thrills,

In disgrace with me
Over there stands my angry angel

More and more for the pain
To release himself, from this shell
Time after time, you may glare at

Drawn up from hell

Dead in the stare of a thousand miles

Around old magazines.

Data mining from old memories

Hm, sunflowers and a smile catching
Hm, welcoming a heartbeat to the family
Light tie lanterns, wish bound in the night

Who, what, when?
All in one stir of a teaspoon
I'm shaken and gasping for air

Lifeline, before and after
In an instant of great white gravity (gravity)
Hold tight, 'cause all is against me

Woah, and keep breathing,
And keep breathing

I will, on one day,

I've still got some go in me yet

For that moment of broken tragedy (tragedy)
Bright-eyed, the world is against me

Are just some of the things I like
So the more that I see of them in my day
The better I sleep at night

Mum, dad, Giles, (Lizzie) and Juliet (Uncle James)
Are just some of the people that I love
So the more of all them I can get in my day
The better I'll sleep at night

I can moonwalk, build castles, play ping pong, talk to animals,
Hold my breath for a really long time, and tell the future
Are just six of the things I can do

Popular, blonde hair, all the pretty girls sit over there

What do I do to make you hate me so much?
Is it the clothes I wear? (The way I speak?)
Wonder bra thrown 'round the German classroom
Me wouldn't understand
I'll never live it down
Hiding in the bushes
Or tip-toeing down the corridor
Stop it, you'll make me laugh
(Why would I ever need to know this?)
And somehow I'll get through
I never want this to end
This night, this music, with you in my arms
Switch in to the real world
No idea what I'm doing
But here it goes (there she goes)

I've found the place, feels like home
But I caught you kissing her
So suddenly I'm on my own
There's just not enough hours in the day
Things are going great, I can't complain
When I stumble to bed, I sleep like a baby

Make love, make money, make a difference
Finding my feet
Connect (connect)

Make money, make a difference

I find myself gazing out of the window for no reason
When did I stop eating bread, and cheese? I love cheese
I want to have children,
But I don't want to have children, you know?

Online, offline, like I'm not really here (A choir)
Awake or sleeping, somehow can't tell the difference (A question)

I am their defenseless host
Through my open wounds they let themselves in
Sheltered (sheltered), they mock me (they mock me)

Crooked frames and cracked glazing
Slithers of wistful window gazes glint in borrowed light

Where doorways with no door stage a ballet of leaves,
Who pirouette in the footsteps of once glorious days

I'm cracking up, and can seem threatening

I'm falling apart

I'm scary at night
Take dark, forbidden
Keep out, keep out!

A has-been, a once was, the leftovers, an eyesore, bleeding, oxidising,
A few remaining, unloved, emotionally damaged, a waste of space,

",Impaler of Souls
Impaler,"Time is suffocated
Actions forbidden
Subconsciously paralysed
Internally rotting
Sucked in and churned out
By the force of lies
Swarming ignorance
Imaginations dies
Chaotic supremacy
Controls the population
Decrepit fools
Have mass domination
Intimidating
Antagonizing
Blindly we obey
We must rid ourselves of this inner decay",Internally Rotting
Impaler,"Inferno unleashed, a new dawn of time
The past is lost, the future's not mine
Burn the innocent, a sadistic reign
Murder by numbers enjoying your pain
Black night of judgement spawns death from the beast
My blood shall be swallowed on my soul they shall feast
Sun peels back, earth sinks to sea
Drowned in madness, inferno consumes me
Condemned forever
Drained of all hope
No doubting our fate
Is at the end of the rope
Visions of nightmares
Malignant dreams
A world in chaos
Ripped to the seams",Malignant Dreams
Impaler,"Rejoice in the sight of the mangled and stamped
Raging skull drillers in bloodied goat masks
Skinning fathers, cast them into red fires
Behold, the hog headed God shall reign
Repel your faith
Death blanked from your mind
What you reject still exists

Can't you see
The sound of liberation is the collapse of the church
Consumed in perverse conflagration
Christendoms debauch
Christ, so he rose from the dead?
Why does death now create fear?
Faith which does not doubt is dead faith
You can't accept, forced to hear

Carnal deity feeds upon energies
You refuse to see
The sights of liberation is the collapse of the church
Consumed in perverse conflagration
Christendoms debauch",Repel Your Faith
Impaler,"Total carnage, a stranglehold
Violent rat race rages uncontrolled
Eternal fires forever burn
Pain and war wherever you turn
Hour of dread twisting your brain
Self induced horror, needless pain
Will you survive this game of death?
Total carnage, draw your last breath",Total Carnage
Impellitteri,"Take a look at the world today, a lot of love seems to slip away
When the feelings start to fade, they start to run
It's not the way it's supposed to be, the flames of love only set you free
To make the choice that you want to be my only one
Life, they say, it can take it's toll, I'm holding on, I won't let you go
It's only you that can touch my soul, my love

I'm forever yours, I love you now for eternity
I'm forever yours, in time my love you'll see
I'm forever yours, I love you more than I ever did
I'm forever yours, it's always you and me
Forever yours

I remember when I began to see, the love we share it was meant to be
If only you would stand by me we'll beat the odds
Trust in me as I trust in you, you've got my heart and you know it's true
Together we can make it through, no matter what
The promises and the life we share, together we can go anywhere
It's only you that I give my soul, my love

I'm forever yours, I love you now for eternity
I'm forever yours, in time my love you'll see
I'm forever yours, I love you more than I ever did
I'm forever yours, it's always you and me
I'm forever yours, I love you now for eternity
I'm forever yours, together, you and me
Forever yours",Forever Yours
Impellitteri,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.

Impellitteri,"I get the same old dreams
Same time every night
Fall to the ground then I wake up
So I get out of bed
Put on my shoes and in my head
Thoughts slide back to the break up

These four walls are closing in
Look at the fix you put me in

*Since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
I'm out of my head
Can't take it
Do not be wrong
But since you've been gone
You cast a spell so break it

Since you've been gone
So in the night I stay
Beneath the back street lights
I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon
But night comes around too soon
You don't know what you mean to me

Your poison letters
Your telegram
Just goes to show you don't give a damn

(Repeat *)
Since you've been gone
If you ever come back
Baby you know, you'll never do wrong

Out on the boulevard, the hammer's coming down

Let me take you to the mansion in the sky

Impellitteri,"When you're lost inside the dead of night
You can hear the city rage
Another one kills and another one dies
And another one shares the pain
See the murder and the rape and a cop on the take
Don't you know that it never ends
The sun will rise and the sun will set
But there's madness in the hearts of men
Caught in the circle with no end in sight
Better turn yourself another page
I'm sick and tired of all the hopeless talk
'Cuz nothing's ever gonna' change

Think I'll fly away into the setting sun
Away from the dark of the night
'Cuz the only time that I feel alright is with you

Caught in the middle of an endless fight
It comes down to time and chance
Got a lot or a little, better enjoy life 
'Cuz you don't know whether love or hate
Is waiting outside your door
So you better pray, there's no delay
From the one that's worth living for

Gonna' fly away into the setting sun
Away from the dark and the night
'Cuz this crazy world lives under the gun
It's only a matter of time
Gonna' fly away into the setting sun
Away from the dark and the night

Stuck in the middle in the dead of night

But they don't know all the pain I feel

Will it be the answer the the mystery

Together we can have it all

Hearing your voice in the night 
Leading me into the light of love

Impellitteri,"There I was in the Garden of Eden, the serpent, more crafty
than any of the wild animals that the Lord God had made
There she was Eve, in paradise, and willing to give me a
listen. So I said, ""Did God really say you must not eat from
any tree in the garden?"" And she responded, ""We may eat fruit
from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. You must
not touch it or you will die!""...""Ha! I say!""

I am the prince of earth, the ruler of the air

Searching for someone to devour and destroy
And in return I give you nothing

Master! Master of disguise!
Twist eternal truth into white lies
Master! Master of disguise!
Turning into gray, the black and white

I send delusion as I lead the world astray
You know my heart's filled with fury!
All sorts of evil I provide temptation for
I am the test of human freedom

Twist eternal truth into white lies
Master! Master of disguise!
Turning into gray, the black and white

I was covered with loneliness

I'm not asking for your sympathy

Life passes by when you're slaving to the grind
What really matters when I cross the finish line

When I'm reaching for the answers I can never trust my lust

I'm alive yet, I wish I was dead,

Imperanon,"As day turned to night, I saw the end approaching
No hope for us, but yet our faith stays strong

Kill them, hatred, flows inside my veins,
This will be the end of our days
All is lost but this blood will stain
My hands, my heart.

Die by my hand, all you hopeless ones
Deep down, my heart, darkest blood it runs
Through my veins its fire's burning bright,
You won't live through the night

My eyes are blind, I won't survive

Years ago my life was torment
In the shadows I wait for my moment
To take your life, to make you pay
Under the cold moon you lay

I care not for the emptiness inside
For in the end of this night
It will be gone, I will be whole
Your blood to mend my broken soul

As day turned to night,
I saw the end approaching
No hope for us, but yet our faith stays strong
No blade to take my life, no pain to make me suffer
This was the end and yet our faith stays strong

To sear my flesh, to open my vein

Can spin faster and makes some more

Hear you howlin` 
I can hear you crawl in the night 
 
As the ice cold wind comes and sweeps through the land 
There`s a whisper that grows to a scream 
From the plains where life is a fraction of time 
Comes the call of the crawl from the wild 
 
Hear you howlin` 
Hear you howlin` 
I can hear you crawl in the night 
 
As the frontier was made for steel towns and roads 
They were scattered and thrown to the wind 
And they gathered again in the deep of the woods 
On a hungry hunt for revenge 
 
Hear you howlin` 
Hear you howlin` 
I can hear you crawl in the night 
 
The tribe that was wiped has now stamped up again 
They`ll come raging through cities and towns 
When the hunger keeps burning in the hours through the night 
Tell me then which side are you on? 
 
Hear you howlin` 
Hear you howlin` 
I can hear you crawl in the night 
 
The hunger of the wild world 
Will never let you down",Wild World

Märk hur vår skugga, märk Movitz mon frère
Inom ett mörker sig slutar
Hur guld och purpur I skoveln, den där
Byts till grus och klutar
Vinkar Charon från sin brusande älv
Och tre gånger sen dödgrävaren själv
Mer do din druva ej kryster
Därföre, Movitz, kom hjälp mig och välv
Gravsten (gravvård) över vår syster
Lillklockan klämtar till storklockans dön
Lövad står kantorn I porten
Och vid de skrålande gossarnas bön
Helgar denna orten
Vägen upp till templets griftprydda stad
Trampas mellan rosors gulnade blad
Multnade plankor och bårar
Till dess den långa och svartklädda rad
Djupt sig bugar med tårar
Så gick till vila från slagsmål och bal
Grälmakar Lövberg din maka
Där, ditåt gräset långhalsig och smal
Hon än glor tillbaka
Hon från Dantobommen skildes idag
Och med henne alla lustiga lag
Vem skall nu flaskan befalla
Torstig var hon och uttorstig är jag
Vi är torstiga alla

Impotent Sea Snakes,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly, vividly
Emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far, like a distant star I'm wishing on tonight

See, normally a brother wouldn't talk about his first time
But I'll just be real wit' y'all and say what's on my mind
Now I remember like yesterday, just a little man
I had no clue, just quite didn't understand

Looked up to big bro for a little advice
He said, â??Young bro, whatever you do, just make sure you're strapped twiceâ??
I was a little nervous about it, bein' my first time
But I said, â??What the hell, this girl is too damn fineâ??

My very first time

My very first time
I can't wait till the day when I see you again, remember

It was just that special (Special to me) to me as it was to you (Oh), girl (Yeah)
My very first time
I will never forget my first time

It was Sunday afternoon, moms and pops were gone
We had to be on the low â??cause they were on their way home
We started kissin', then it led straight to the bed
I can't believe this happened, so I'm thinkin' in my head

Lasted like a minute, but it seemed like forever
We almost got caught, but I'm just too damn clever
Her parents came home from church and I was outta there like a drop of a dime
Man, I will never forget my first time

This goes out to my folks, do you know
And you know I will see you again (See you again, no, no)
And no matter how far, people get no regrets
I will never forget (My first time)

My very (Oh, yeah) first time
In the house, on the couch, in your parent's bedroom (Remember ), remember
My very first time (I know you remember, girl)
I can't wait till the day when I see you again, remember

My very first time
It was just that special to me as it was to you, girl
My very first time
I will never forget my first time

See, some of you might have started early
Some of you started late
But I know when I started
That I thought it was great

This goes out to all my little brothers of the world

In Extremo,"Ich fing ihr Herz an einem Sommertag
Der auf dem Wasser so mÃ¼de lag
Die Luft erbrach sich fast vor Fruchtbarkeit
Und unsereins der hat schon lang nicht mehr
Sich in ein Weiberfell hineingewÃ¼hlt
Sie sang ihr schÃ¶nstes Lied so schwarz wie Teer
Bis die Nacht herunterfiel
Da lag sie da ohne ihr Kleid

Ich hieb Drei Zweige ab vom Strauch
Und legte sie dann auf ihren Bauch
Sie war so jung und alt genug
Und auch der Nabel war versteckt vom Haar
Und tief darunter lag der Muschelmund
Egal was ihr so von mir denkt
Sie hat mir nicht nur eine Nacht geschenkt
Leider schnell wie Schnee der zerrinnt

:Nur ein Traum am bleichen Teich:

Zuletzt hat mich das Luder doch genarrt
Ohne ihre Mund, das Gras war hart
Und auch das Wasser ist kein WeiberschoÃ?
Wenn man sich am bleichen Teich verirrt
Mit einer Mondfrau paart vielleicht
Wird dann mein Herz die Schmerzen los
Und singt der Liebe bald ein neues Lied
Wie ein Netz die Muscheln aus der Tiefe zicht

Dass jeder wind daran vorber lief

Und wie es heiss zu mir herberrann

Weils solche liebe nicht mehr gibt
Ich hab mich in dein rotes haar verliebt

Im feld den ganzen sommer war
Der mohn so rot nicht wie dein rotes haar
Jetzt wird es abgemht das gras
Die bunten blumen welken auch dahin

Und wenn der rote mohn so blass geworden ist
Dann hat es keinen sinn
Dass es noch weisse wolken gibt
Ich hab mich in dein rotes haar verliebt

Du sagst dass es bald kinder gibt
Wenn man sich in dein rotes haar verliebt
So rot wie mohn so wei wie schnee
Du bleibst im winter auch mein rotes reh

Ich komm zu dir nur in der Nacht
Ich warte dass die Sonne untergeht

Am weiten Himmelszelt

Bis die Nacht zerfällt

Wenn der Atem lusterfüllt

Der saß auf seinem Throne finster und bleich
Was er sinnt ist Schrecken, was er blickt ist Wut
Was er spricht ist Geißel, was er schreibt ist Blut

Einer hat schwarze Locken, der andre ist grau von Haar
Der Graue sprach zum Jungen: ""Sei bereit mein Sohn,
Spiel die besten Lieder, stimm an den vollsten Ton!""

:Es regnet, es regnet Blut
Es regnet den Spielmannsfluch:

Es spielen die beiden Sänger I'm hohen Säulensaal
Auf dem Throne sitzt das Königspaar
Der König so prächtig wie blutiger Nordenschein
Die Königin so süß wie der Sonnenschein

Sie singen von Lenz, Liebe, Heiligkeit
Sie zerfloss in Wehmut, Lust war auch dabei
Ihr habt mein Volk geblendet, verlangt ihr nun mein Weib?
Der König schreit wütend, er bebt am ganzen Leib

Es regnet, es regnet Blut
Es regnet den Spielmannsfluch

Des Königs Schwert blitzend des Jünglings Brust durchdringt
Statt der goldnen Lieder nun ein Blutstrahl springt
Der Jüngling hat verröchelt in seines Meisters Arm
Dann schreit der Alte schaurig, der Marmorsaal zerspringt

do verfluchter Mörder, do Fluch des Spielmann Tun
Umsonst sei all dein Ringen, mit Blut befleckt dein Tun
Des Königs Namen meldet kein Lied, kein Heldenbuch
Versunken und vergessen - das ist des Spielmanns Fluch

And you fear you're the next one

It's in your dream
There's just one question
Should I kill
Or should I be left behind

Sick and tired
Of all your complaints 
This is the hour
We bring it down

I've come to realize
Every little glimpse, you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected, cloud connected

You seem to be
So introverted
How come we fail
With all that is given

You crossed the line
You remember my name
Time runs backwards
As long as you are heading that way",Cloud Connected [Club Connected Remix]

Been haunted by a million screams

Burning into the night.

Too many people

Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in.

Superman where are you now
Everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, men of power
Are losing control by the hour.

This is the time
This is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go round
Tell me why, this is a land of confusion.

And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying

I remember long ago 
When the sun was shining
The stars were bright
All through the night
And the sound of your laughter
As I held you tight
So long ago 

I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know, we'll never keep.

Too many people

Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for.

Sell me the infection, it's only for the weak 
No need for sympathy, the misery that is me 
No need for sympathy, it's only for the weak 
On bleeding knees I accept my fate 

I've lost the ability to paint the clouds

A world out of my mind
Ready to explode in purity to fill the holes inside

An ever moving stream with glowing rays of light
Emotions tied to pass lies and I know I should let go

Tamed with confidence of a brighter future

I found a flame in the burnt out ashes... burn out, burn out!

Fueled, these new shores burn, dark past lies cold
Shadow, my sweet shadow, to you I look no more

Another dawn collapses
Do I need to be reminded
A glimpse of my safe home
A path to hide all anger

I found a flame in the burnt out ashes... burn out, burn out!

Fueled, these new shores burn, dark past lies cold
Shadow, my sweet shadow, to you I look no more

In circles I catch
A torch carried by the immortal
From depths that I created
In vain echoes fade

Cause I blame him
For all I don't want to know

Life's wrapped in a riddle,
Easier said than done,
Hate to play the victim,
Rather run and hide.

Until we are erased
But it doesn't mean a thing

And I can't remember
What the skies looked like
Will I find out That I'm late for salvation?

What if tomorrow never comes?
Don't let it slip away

This is my world now
I can't let you bring me down
This new faith guide me through
Things will come my way
Put it down and join the lie

Someday I will
I'm gonna take the world on
Someday I will

When the curtain falls
With denials blindfold
It greets another day

Don't believe the mask
It attempts to really lie
The perfect ten
When reality caves in

Don't tell me, tell my ghost
'Cause I blame him
For all I don't want to know
I found secrets about lies under told

Life's wrapped in a riddle
Easier said than done
Wait to play the victim
Just run and hide

Don't believe the mask
It attempts to really lie
The perfect ten
Where reality caves in

Don't tell me, tell my ghost
'Cause I blame him
For all I don't want to know
Well, I found secrets about life under told
Let them take me far away

Call back in place
It's easier to cope behind the curtain
Wipe the worries away
No thought about a consequence

Don't believe the mask
It attempts to really lie
The perfect ten
When reality caves in

Don't tell me, tell my ghost
'Cause I blame him
For all I don't want to know
Well, I found secrets about life under told
Let them take me far away

Approaching constant failure
Tell me which side I'm on
Who is friend of foe?
Approaching constant failure

Between love and hate
Which path to follow?
How can I keep balance in this race?
Come faith, I'm dying... 

Slowly

In many ways I'm the burden
That divides us from the light
In many ways you're the halo
That keeps my spirit alive

Temptation,
Play the good or evil part
With me, you evoke the dark
Erase the free will watch me heal

Tell me which side I'm on
Approaching constant failure

Amused by the trials and tribulations
If I survive I fly from here
But as the chosen pessimist
I carve my name in stone
I carve my name in stone

How can I keep Balance in this race?
Come faith, I'm dying... Slowly",The Chosen Pessimist [Vinyl Remaster 2016]
