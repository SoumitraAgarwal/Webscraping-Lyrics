Lucinda Williams,"I can't keep walkin' down the street 
'Fore some pretty daddy start breakin' down with me 

Stop breakin' down
Please, please, stop breakin' down
I got the stuff that'll bust your brains out, baby
Make you lose your mind

These no good men love to ape and clown 
They don't do nothin' but tear my good reputation down 

Stop breakin' down
Please, please, stop breakin' down
I got the stuff that'll bust you brains out, baby
Make you lose your mind

I can't walk the streets now, I can't consolate my mind
'Fore some no good man starts breakin' down 

Stop breakin' down
Please, please, stop breakin' down
I got the stuff that'll bust your brains out, baby
Make you lose your mind

I give my baby the ninety-ninth degree 
Then he rose up and brought a pistol down on me 

Stop breakin' down
Please, please, stop breakin' down
I got the stuff that'll bust your brains out, baby
Make you lose your mind

I can't keep walkin' down the street
'Fore some no good man start breakin' down with me

Stop breakin' down
Please, please, stop breakin' down

Lucinda Williams,"I been lookin for my old man
I can't find him nowhere
I think I'll go Chicago
And look around over there

If I can't find him
Go back on the river and sit right down
That man keep a worryin' poor me
I'm gonna jump overboard and drown

My man, he come sit down
He come sit down right beside me
He said: ""Would be good, Mama
If you just come with me""

And I go with my baby
What man like a woman with a sassy child
I won't have to ask him no questions
Man, because he knows the reason why

I feel so disgusted
I don't know what to do
I think I'll go uptown
Try to find me somethin' new

Meet a man with a Cadillac
Whoah man, and plenty money too
I won't have to wake up 
Early in the mornin'
'Cause I won't have nothin' 
In the world to do",Disgusted
Lucinda Williams,"What a beautiful thought I'm thinking 
Concerning a great speckled bird 
Remember her name is recorded 
On the pages of God's Holy Word 

All the other birds are flocking 'round her 
And she is despised by the squad 
But the great speckled bird in the Bible 
Is one with the great church of God 

All the other churches are against her 
They envy her glory and fame 
They hate her because she is chosen 
And has not denied Jesus' name 

Desiring to lower her standard 
They watch every move that she makes 
They long to find fault with her teachings 
But really they find no mistake 

She is spreading her wings for a journey 
She's going to leave by and by 
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning 
She'll rise and go up in the sky 

In the presence of all her despiser's 
With a song never uttered before 
She will rise and be gone in a moment 
Till the great tribulation is over 

I am glad I have learned of her meekness 
I am proud that my name is on her book 
For I want to be one never fearing 
The face of my Savior to look

When He cometh descending from heaven 
On the cloud that He writes in His Word 
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him 
On the wings of that great speckled bird",Great Speckled Bird
Lucinda Williams,"Honey, make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet on your floor

Honey, I can't lay down on your bed
You know that I can't lay down on your bed
Yes, you know that I can't lay down 'cross your pretty bed
'cause my good woman she might kill me dead

And don't you let my good gal catch you here
No don't you let my good gal catch you here

Then maybe my good gal she won't know

Lucinda Williams,"Won't you be my chauffeur
Won't you be my chauffeur

Yes he drives so easy I can't turn him down

But I don't want him
But I don't want him
To be ridin' his girls
To be ridin' his girls around
So I'm gonna steal me a pistol, shoot my chauffeur down

Well I must buy him
Well I must buy him

Wanna let my chauffeur
Drive me around the
Drive me around the world
Then he can be my little boy, yes I'll be his girl",Me and My Chauffeur Blues

Lucinda Williams,"I got ramblin', I got ramblin' on my mind
Little boy, little boy, I got ramblin' on my mind
I hate to leave you, baby, but you treat me so unkind

I got mean things, I got mean things on my mind
I got mean things, I got mean things on my mind
I hate to leave you, baby, but you treat me so unkind

I'ma pack up my bags, I'ma leave with the morning train
I'ma pack up my bags, I'ma leave with the morning train
I hate to hear it, baby, when you call me so-and-so name

I'm goin' down to the station, take the fastest metal train I see
I'm goin' down to the station, take the fastest metal train I see
I got the blues for Mister So-And-So, he got the blues about me

Lucinda Williams,"How many times
Have you heard someone say
If I had his money
I'd do things my way
How little they know
That it's so hard to find
One rich man in a hundred
With a satisfied mind

Once I was living
In fortune and fame
And everything I could dream of
To get a start in life's game
And suddenly it happened
I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far
With a satisfied mind

No money can buy back
Your youth when your old
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a heart that's grown cold
And the world's richest man
Is a pauper at times
Compared to the man
With a satisfied mind

When my life is over
And my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones
I'll leave there's no doubt
But there's one thing for certain
When it comes my time
I'll leave this old world
With a satisfied mind
I'll leave this old world
With a satisfied mind",Satisfied Mind

Lucinda Williams,"Tryin' hard to be a happy woman
But sometimes life just overcomes me
Everyday I'm workin' just to pay my dues
Lay down at night, my mind is so confused
Goin' down south with the New York City blues

Gotta hit the road before I blow a fuse
I might buy me a Cadillac or a Chevrolet
I don't care what model as long as it takes me away

I've been hiding my heart in a trunk
Can you come see me when my ship has sunk
You can give me lovin', that I can't refuse
And love is the one thing that's sure to cure my blues
Goin' down the road with a heave heart

Tryin' to find lightness in the dark
Tryin' to live my life, tryin' to get satisfied
My mind is in the city but my heart is in the countryside

Tryin' hard to be a happy woman
But sometimes life just overcomes me
Everyday I'm workin' just to pay my dues
Lay down at night, my mind is so confused
Lay down at night, my mind is so confused",Happy Woman Blues
Lucinda Williams,"How long have you been hangin' around
Your eyes fixed to the cement ground
Your heart is warm, your hands are cold
You know the truth, but the story gets old
You stood on the corner for a long time
People passin' by you gave you nickels and dimes
They think you're one of the nameless
Cause you got no record and you ain't famous

[Chorus]
Oh, bill, I know how you're feelin'
Your heart's on fire and your head is reelin'
But with the spirit to guide you
And a friend beside you
You know you'll win
If you're only willin'

The sun's so hot and my heart is thumpin'
Let me buy you a beer or somethin'
You've been travellin' a hard road
Sit down, bill, lighten your load
If you need a friend, give me a call
I got your picture on my wall
From one compadre to another
I love you, bill, as I would my brother

[Chorus: x2]",Hard Road
Lucinda Williams,"Howlin' at midnight, winter creepin' in
Feel like I've gone and lost my best friend
My best friend, lost my best friend
This car's headed down the wrong track again

I ain't got nobody, I'm nobody's girl
Gonna get in my mercury and drive around the world
Around the world, all around the world
When I reach that mountain top I'll stand with flags unfurled

She's up in new york city tryin' to make it big
Wrote me a letter yesterday sayin' I ain't got no gigs
Ain't got no gigs, I ain't got no gigs
If you want to send me somethin', make it a two dollar rig

She's up in new york city tryin' to be a star
Told me you're wastin' your time where you are
Where you are, where you are
Gotta get yourself out of all those texas bars

Howlin' at midnight, winter creepin' in
Feel like I've gone and lost my best friend

Lucinda Williams,"I think I lost it
Let me know if you come across it
Let me know if I let it fall
Along a back road somewhere
Money can't replace it
No memory can erase it
And I know I'm never gonna find
Another one to compare
Give me some love to fill me up

Give me some time give me some stuff
Give me a sign give me some kind of reason
Are you heavy enough to make me stay
I feel like I might blow away
I thought I was in heaven
But I was only dreaming
I think I lost it

Let me know if I let it fall
Along a back road somewhere
Money can't replace it
No memory can erase it
And I know I'm never gonna find
Another one to compare

I just wanna live the life I please
I don't want no enemies
I don't want nothing if I have to fake it
Never take nothing don't belong to me

Everything's paid for nothing free
If I give my heart
Will you promise not to break it
I think I lost it
Let me know if you come across it
Let me know if I let it fall
Along a back road somewhere
Money can't replace it
No memory can erase it

Lucinda Williams,"Can you relieve me, baby
Take your heart from your sleeve
And put it on the line
Put it right here beside mine

I knew it from the start
Whoever's holding the cards, please deal me the King of Hearts
Please deal me the King of Hearts

If you came to my door
And you asked me for more I'd lay down beside you

And if I had lots of gold I'd make a rich man of you

Lucinda Williams,"Oh, my sweet Lafayette, how I'm going to miss you.
You feel so good, Lafayette, now I've come to greet you
Tell all my friends I've come back again
I couldn't stay away, I was gone only a day
But I'm comin' back to my sweet Lafayette

I'm goin' down to Lafayette, I don't care how long I'm gone
It's so hard to leave you, Lafayette, now I know where I belong
When that sweet fiddle sounds and Clifton gets down
That music sounds so good to me, I just might dance until three
And I gotta get back to my sweet Lafayette

Oh, those boys in Lafayette, smilin' so pretty
Those sweet boys in Lafayette, they sure do look good to me
We danced all night long to a sweet Cajun song
Drinkin' and jivin' 'til dawn, I could dance on and on
Doin' a two-step in my sweet Lafayette
Take me back Lafayette, way down on the bayou
I'm your girl, Lafayette, I'm gonna hang around you
Eat that gumbo and rollin' and tumble
And do crazy things every night, soon I'll be feelin' alright

When I get back to my sweet Lafayette",Lafayette
Lucinda Williams,"[Chorus] 
Louisiana man with a style his own
Not like some other men I've known 
With his cowboy boots and his hats he wore so well
Caught me eye on the very first day 
And I never will forget the way 
He played guitar and he sang just like an angel

Thoughts of you flicker past
Goin' on down the road so fast
The trees and the bushes and the telephones poles fly by
I never seem to have the time
I'll just have to keep you on my mind
How I wish I could keep you by my side

[Chorus]
 
Country man with a heart of gold 
One more kiss before I hit the road 
Hold me one more time before I go 
Nights will be longer now 
But I'll get along somehow 
I've learned how to do it all before

Lucinda Williams,"Maria, you're still wild and restless
And I can just see ya ridin' in a rodeo
You might even make it down to Texas
Or you might head out west to New Mexico

So pack up all of your belongings
A pick-up will take you where you want to go
You can ride out when you hear mountains calling
Out to Canada or the canyons of Colorado

New York City was always your home
But in your heart you know you were born to roam
And you're gonna leave as soon as you get the money
After you sell everything you own

Maria, is loneliness a virtue
Or does it steal you blind and leave you split apart
Maria, can you give me an answer
Are the songs we sing worth the broken heart

The highway has always been your lover
And someday you may know his name
Wherever you stay it wouldn't really matter
'Cause all those cities start to look the same

Some folks will try to take your heart away
And just when you think you've really got it made
You wake up and find madness in the morning
But damn the pain and damn those restless days
Damn the pain and damn those restless days",Maria
Lucinda Williams,"[Chorus]
Just another one night stand
Just another man to forget
Just another empty hand
With nothin' left to bet

It doesn't really matter what i say
There's no one here to blame
I'll just close the door and walk away
Let down once again
I can't even say you lied to me
'Cause you ain't said nothin' yet
You never even tried for me
There's nothin' to regret

[Chorus]

I'd like to speak to you someway
But the words won't come out right
How can it feel so wrong today
When it felt so right last night

No silken strings to bind
No promises unbroken
No messages to find

If I could take just one last look
But you left me just one last trace

Your words run through me like the blood in my veins
I could swear I knew your love before I knew your name

Before I knew your name

Everyday I miss your smiling face
No one here can ever take your place
The sun can shine down over my town
But it never shines in my days

I won't demand you I'll try to understand you

This ain't the first time I've been undermined
Sad eyes and crooked smile that I remember well

You can't fool me, I see it in your eyes
You can't fool me, I see it in your eyes
Everything I thought we had has all been cast aside

You can't fool me, I see it in your eyes

These boots are the same boots I was wearin' then
And this beer I'm drinkin' is still the same old brand
But these blues are something new, they came around when I lost you

Am I too blue?

Is the night too black?
Is the wind too rough?

Have you had enough?

Do you miss my touch?
Do you wanna stay?
Do you have so much
Still left to say?

Lucinda Williams,"I changed the lock on my front door so you can't see me anymore
And you can't come inside my house, and you can't lie down on my couch
I changed the lock on my front door

I changed the number on my phone so you can't call me up at home
And you can't say those things to me that make me fall down on my knees
I changed the number on my phone

I changed the kind of car I drive so you can't see me when I go by
And you can't chase me up the street, and you can't knock me off of my feet
I changed the kind of car I drive

I changed the kind of clothes I wear so you can't find me anywhere
And you can't spot me in a crowd, and you can't call my name out loud

I changed the tracks underneath the train so you can't find me again
And you can't trace my path, and you can't hear my laugh

And you can't touch me like before, and you can't make me want you more

He wasn't brought up right he never got enough love
The screams and the bruises and the broken bottles
These were things he understood
From busted chairs to a broken heart
He got away as soon as he could

Shot a kid near a liquor store one night

Lucinda Williams,"Back in Memphis she was a pearl
She was everyone's favorite girl
Now her eyes have a vacant stare
What she wouldn't give to be livin' back there
She married a man when she left home
She wanted someone she could call her own
He was good to her when he wasn't drunk
He'd hold her and tell her how pretty she looked
Back in Memphis where she grew up
The life she knew was just not enough
Back in Memphis when she was a girl
She thought one day she'd own the world
She'd look at the TV and magazines
And she'd believe all the pictures she'd seen
She'd be wearin' silk and perfume so sweet
But those things don't mean much out here on the street

Back in Memphis she had fun
Goin' around, tellin' everyone
She was gonna buy dresses that zip up the side
And wear red lipstick, have a nice car to drive
She bounces her baby on her knee
Sayin' maybe today we'll get lucky, you'll see
I promise it won't always be like this
Come here, sugar, give Mamma a kiss

I couldn't believe what he just said
Sonny shot himself with a 44
And they found him lyin' on his bed

I could not speak a single word
No tears streamed down my face
I just sat there on the living room couch
Starin' off into space

Mama and Daddy went over to the house
To see what had to be done
They took the sheets off of the bed
And they went to call someone

Some of us gathered at a friend's house
To help each other ease the pain
I just sat alone in a corner chair
I couldn't say much of anything

We drove on out to the country
His friends all stood around
Subiaco Cemetery
Is where we lay him down

I saw his mama, she was standin' there
His sister, she was there too
I saw them look at us standin' around the grave
And not a soul they knew

Born and raised in Pineola
His mama believed in the Pentecost
She got the preacher to say some words
So his soul wouldn't be lost

Some of us, we stood in silence
Some bowed their heads and prayed
I think I must've picked up a handful of dust
And let it fall over his grave

I thought he was mine
Thought I'd always be his valentine

I told him no way baby that's your own death you see

I couldn't believe what he just said
Sonny shot himself with a 44 
And they found him lyin' on his bed
I could not speak a single word 
No tears streamed down my face
I just sat there on the living room couch 
Starin' off into space
Mama and Daddy went over to the house 
To see what had to be done
They took the sheets off of the bed 
And they went to call someone
Some of us gathered at a friend's house 
To help each other ease the pain
I just sat alone in a corner chair 
I couldn't say much of anything
We drove on out to the country
His friends all stood around
Subiaco Cemetery 
Is where we lay him down
I saw his mama, she was standin' there 
His sister, she was there too
I saw them look at us standin' around the grave 
And not a soul they knew
Born and raised in Pineola 
His mama believed in the Pentecost
She got the preacher to say some words 
So his soul wouldn't be lost
Some of us, we stood in silence 
Some bowed their heads and prayed

And let it fall over his grave

And see what a quarter will do
I don't want to talk

Feeds me when I'm hungry
And quenches my thirst
Loves me when I'm lonely

When the red sound disappears from the sky

Raven feathers shiny and black
A touch of blue glistening down her back

And we don't talk about hell

For all the world to see

And feast on black cherries
And swallow the manna from heaven
And spit out the seeds

You spread your anger on sharp-edged knives
Cut my skin and make it bleed
Like pilate in his self righteousness
You're a traitor and a thief

Choking on your unplanned words
Coughing up your lies
Tumbling from your mouth a flurry
Of broken butterflies

But the blood that flows I cannot hide
That blood that covers me
Nourishes the butterflies
And they are healed and are set free

I wish you had what Ruth possessed
But then I don't expect that of you

And the love that you refuse

Will you ever learn to just forgive
Will you open your beautiful eyes
And bleed the way Christ did
And fix the broken butterflies",Broken Butterflies

To see if the camellias were in bloom

By the sweet honeysuckle that grew all around
Were switches when we were bad

I took a bus to Baton Rouge

All the front rooms were kept closed off
I never liked to go in there much

The company couch covered in plastic
Little books about being sved
The dining room table nobody ate at
The piano nobody played

There was this beautiful lamp I always loved
A seashore was painted on the shade
It would turn around when you switched on the bulb
And gently rock the waves

The driveway was covered with 
Tiny white seashells
A fig tree stood in the backyard
There are other things I remember as well
But to tell them would just be too hard

Follow me wherever I go

Hide deep deep down in my soul

And sugarcane
Grapes and honeydew melon
Enough fit for a queen

'Til branches bend and fruit falls to the ground
Baby, sweet baby

Come to my world and witness
The way things have changed
'Cause I finally did it, baby
I got out of La Grange

Got in my Mercury and drove out west
Pedal to the metal and my luck to the test
Baby, sweet baby

Lucinda Williams,"I've been waiting for you to come back
Since you left Minneapolis
Snow covers the streetlamps and the windowsills
The buildings and the brittle crooked trees
Dead leaves of December
Thin skinned and splintered
Never gotten used to this bitter winter

I've been wasted, angry and sad
Since you left Minneapolis
I wish my thoughts were pure like the driven snow
Like the heavens and the spring's virgin buds
But they strangle me with their sin
Fill me up with poison
Black clouds have covered up the sun again

I can always trace it back
To that night in Minneapolis
Here on the seventh floor in a room I can't call mine
Deadbolt on the door, do not disturb sign
Shaking and trembling
On the clean white linen
Slivers of starlight across the ceiling

A dozen yellow roses
All that's left in Minneapolis
I wish I'd never seen your face or heard your voice
You're a bad pain in my gut
I want to spit you out
Open up this wound again
Let my blood flow red and thin
Into the glistening
Into the whiteness
Into the melting snow of Minneapolis",Minneapolis

Your little tennis shoes and your pick-up sticks
You were screamed at and kicked over and over
Now you always feel sick and you can't keep a lover
Every Christmas there were presents to unwrap
But the things you witnessed when you were five and a half

Someone deserted you, the damage is done
Now you don't deserve to be loved by no one
Hands that would feed you when you were two
Were the same hands that beat you black and blue

You're overly sensitive and overly concerned
Few precious memories, no lullabies
Hollowed out centuries of lies

I've seen you in the kitchen cookin' me supper
I listened to you bitchin' and I watched you suffer

Did you only need me for those three days?

Maybe a little music might help

the edges of the sun then
I wanna get swallowed up in

Go out into the street
Get a lump in my throat
And look down at my feet

So I can ride around

And turn up the sound

Drive up the coastline
Maybe Ventura
Watch the waves make signs
Out on the water

Give me back my power

Know when to stop
How would blood know
Which body to flow outside of

Which back door to walk through

Better spent on groceries or covering the bills
Instead of little luxuries and unnecessary frills

Lily of the valley and long black limousines
It's three or four months' salaries just to pay for all those things

So don't but a fancy funeral, it's not worth it in the end

If a prostitute was Queen

If the rains brought down the moon
And daylight was feared
And the sun rose too soon,
And then just disappeared

And the Pope should cum
If hobos had wings
And God was a bum

If houses became trees
And flowers turned to stone
And there were no families
And people lived alone

If buildings started laughing
And windows cried
And feet started clapping
And out came inside

If mountains fell in slivers
And the sky began to bleed
And blood filled up the rivers
And prisoners were freed

If the stars fell apart
And the ocean dried up
And the world was one big heart
And decided to start

And children grew up happier
And they could run with the wolves

And givin' away what he cant use

Is my love in Birmingham
Making honey from the bees
Over joyed to be my man
And rollin' up his flannel sleeves

Is my love in Gainesville
Pretty, radiant and warm
Drinkin' whiskey til hes had his fill
Inspired by a summer storm

[Chorus]",Where Is My Love?
Lucinda Williams,"I would rather suffer sweet silent solitude
Deathly defiant from drowning out
Filthy sounds stumbling, ugly and cruel
Between the lips of your beautiful mouth

Deep down within me words move in phases
Frozen and still until they decide
To melt and drip over the pages
Until that moment they live inside

My words enjoy the feel of the paper
Better than me, lay with your consonants
Once they get going they never waver
And they slip in between your if, ands, and buts

When my words are hiding between the lines
Then I'm afraid they won't hear me call
What if they fail me without a sign?
What if they hardly surface at all?

Screaming and throwing your weight around
My words choose knowledge over politics
You can't kill my words...they know no bounds
My words are strong and they don't make me sick

They still remain my only companion
Boiling truth to the very end
They'll never ever completely abandon
Ever give up the paper and the pen",Words

Some things will stay the same

When I see you walk across the floor
And put your hand around the doorknob

You head down the drive and hope
The Chevy decides to start
I'm just at the end of my rope
And you're just tugging at my heart

You turn around to wave goodbye
You look at me and linger
The morning hears you sigh
And sunlight reflects off the silver on your finger

And from what I hear, your latest dish
Lives for you, and scares you half to death

You bend over backwards to make a statement
Hang from the rafters and lick the pavement
Split your lip and barely catch your breath

Your lovely eyes, they close like petals
Your sweet surprise could win you medals
You strut your stuff and fan your peacock feathers

Even if you fake it to get attention
Whatever it'll take to get them to listen
Piss on your designer boots and designer leathers

Hey little rock star, what don't you see
This is not all that it's cracked up to be
And I can't say I blame you
For throwing the towel in or buying more fame
by cashing your chips in
But with all of your talent, and so much to gain
To toss it away like that would be such a shame

Juvenile delinquent, misunderstood
Peter Pan and Robin Hood
Will you ever do the things you're afraid to do

Will you ever know happiness, little rock star
Or is your death wish stronger than you are
Will you go up in flames like the torches
That are carried for you

When hero's let us down
And innocence lies rusted
Frozen beneath the ground

And the the fruit trees we planted are withered and rotten
The abuse and magnificent suffer from infection
And the promises were given but never with intention
War becomes common place, secrets overheard
And violence, big business and love is just a word

Why do we marry? 
Why do we fall in love? 
Keep on believing in love
Because love, love is a my soar

Since you came along
No one's even attempted
To come close to the beauty of your song

No hits on the radio
No one knows who you are
No big deal with a video
So you're never gonna be a star

You won't be attending
Meetings with presidents
Of companies pretending
To protect their investments

While they suck the gristle
Off the bones of your art
Unfaithful and fickle
Seductive and smart

They'll say you're a rarity
And sleep in your bed
And strangle your purity
And leave you for dead

They'll call you little honey
And write you a check
Seduce you with money
And fuck your respect

For offering a small glimpse
Through your secret door
Of your intellect and brilliance
You deserve so much more

When you made the decision to get off this ride
Did you run out of places to go and hide
Did you know everybody would be surprised
When you made the decision to get off this ride

When you made the decision to jump ship
Once and for all lose your grip
Did you wax the deck to make it easier to slip
When you made the decision to jump ship

When did you start seeing black
Was it too much good you felt you lacked
Was it too much weight riding on you back
When did you start seeing black

When did you start seeing red
Did you see me standing over your bed
Did you hear anything I said
When did you start seeing red

When did you start seeing white
Tell me baby, what was it like
Was it when you received your last rites
When did you start seeing white

Did you use a compass to get out of this place
Did you ever hear my voice, did you see my face
Did you finally get tired of running the race
Did you use a compass to get out of this place

Did you feel your act was a final truth
The dramatic ending of a misspent youth
Did you really feel you had all the proof
Did you feel your act was a final truth

Was it hard to finally pull the plug
Was it hard to receive that final hug
Did evil triumph over love
Was it hard to finally pull the plug

When did you start seeing black
Was it too much good you felt you lacked
Was it too much weight riding on you back
When did you start seeing black

When did you start seeing red
Did you see me standing over your bed
Did you hear anything I said
When did you start seeing red

When did you start seeing white

Lucinda Williams,"I met my enemy today
Baby sends the little one out to play
Enemy shot two of my buddies down
Baby rides the little one on the
Merry-go-round

By my post, I'm standing guard
Baby hopes for roses in the front yard
I don't know my enemy's name
Baby takes the little one to a
Baseball game

Why am I in this God forsaken place?
Baby washes the dirt off 
The little one's face
Ten year old's in the killing fields
Baby's planning the weekly meals

Bodies in a muddy ditch
Baby's got supper to fix
My buddy's got a hole in his head
Baby's getting the little one ready for bed

Today I shot my enemy
Baby gives the little one a hug for me
Both my buddy's legs got blown off
Baby tends to the little one's cough

I stare down the barrel of a gun
Baby's goin' out to have some fun
I hear ringing in my ears
Baby's face is all wet with tears

I hear echoes of shots
Baby's only thinkin' sweet thoughts
Why the hell did they send me
Here to fight?
Baby kisses my picture and turns
Off the light

I can't look my enemy in the eye
Baby tells the little one, 
Daddy's gone bye-bye
Today I took a bullet through the heart
Baby's gonna have to make 
A brand new start

Non e' una stella
Che al mattino se ne va
Oh no no no no no no

Fatto solo di poesia

Tu sei mia, tu sei mia

Avran luce per guardare gli occhi tuoi

Perche' non e' una promessa

Vento puo' morire, ma vivra'

Quanto il mondo
Fino a quando gli occhi miei
Avran luce per guardare gli occhi tuoi.

Perche' io sono innamorato

Che ne sai della nostra ferrovia?

Lucio Battisti,"Il carretto passava
E quell'uomo gridava ""Gelati"".
Al 21 del mese I nostri soldi
Erano già finiti.
Io pensavo a mia madre 
E rivedevo I suoi vestiti,
Il più bello era nero
Coi fiori non ancora appassiti.

All'uscita di scuola 
I ragazzi vendevano I libri,
Io restavo a guardarli 
Cercando il coraggio per imitarli
Poi sconfitto tornavo a giocar
Con la mente e I suoi tarli,
E la sera al telefono 
Tu mi chiedevi
""Perché non parli"".

Che anno è 
Che giorno è
Questo è il tempo 
Di vivere con te.
Le mie mani 
Come vedi
Non tremano più
E ho nell'anima
In fondo all'anima
Cieli immensi
E immenso amore
E poi ancora
Ancora amore
Amor per te.
Fiumi azzurri
E colline 
E praterie
Dove corrono dolcissime
Le mie malinconie.
L'universo 
Trova spazio 
Dentro me,
Ma il coraggio di vivere,
Quello, ancora non c'è...

I giardini di marzo
Si vestono di nuovi colori
E le giovani donne in quel mese
Vivono nuovi amori.
Camminavi al mio fianco
Ad un tratto dicesti
""Tu muori. Se mi aiuti
Son certa che io
Ne verrò fuori"".
Ma non una parola chiarì
I miei pensieri,
Continuai a camminare 
Lasciandoti attrice di ieri...

Quel che anch'io non so capire

No non ti svegliare mai

I miei occhi stan piangendo
A me sembra di strappare
Qualche cosa dentro me
E vorrei gridare

No ma se guardo quella porta
Io la vedo già aperta
Ed ho voglia di fuggire
Di lasciare dietro me

Tutto quanto insieme a te
Di partire solo
Ah quando s'alza il vento
Ah quando s'alza il vento
No più fermare non si può

Lucio Dalla,"Ti ho guardata e per il momento
Non esistono due occhi come i tuoi
Così neri, così soli che
Se mi guardi ancora e non li muovi
Diventan belli anche i miei
E si capisce da come ridi che
Fai finta e che non capisci, non vuoi guai
Ma ti giuro che per quella bocca che
Se ti guardo diventa rossa

Morirei 
Ma chissà se lo sai? 
Ma chissà se lo sai? 
Forse tu non lo sai
No, tu non lo sai

Poi parliamo delle distanze, del cielo
E di dove va a dormire la luna quando esce il sole
E di come era la terra prima che ci fosse l'amore
E sotto quale stella, tra mille anni, se ci sarà una stella, ci si potrà abbracciare? 
E poi la notte col suo silenzio regolare
Quel silenzio che a volte sembra la morte
Mi dà il coraggio di parlare
E di dirti tranquillamente
Di dirtelo finalmente
Che ti amo
E che di amarti non smetterò mai 
Così adesso lo sai, così adesso lo sai",Chissa' Se lo Sai
Lucio Dalla,"Ti hanno visto bere a una fontana 
Che non ero io
Ti hanno visto spogliata la mattina 
Biricchina biriccò

Mentre con me non ti spogliavi 
Neanche la notte
Ed eran botte, Dio, che botte

Ti hanno visto alzare la sottana
La sottana fino al pelo, che nero
Poi m'hai detto ""Poveretto
Il tuo sesso dallo al gabinetto""
Te ne sei andata via con la tua amica
Quella alta, grande fica

Tutte e due a far qualcosa di importante
Di unico e di grande
Io sto sempre in casa, esco poco
Penso solo e sto in mutande

Penso a delusioni, a grandi imprese 
A una thailandese
Ma l'impresa eccezionale, dammi retta
È essere normale
Quindi, normalmente 
Sono uscito dopo una settimana
Non era tanto freddo, e normalmente 
Ho incontrato una puttana

A parte i capelli, il vestito 
La pelliccia e lo stivale
Aveva dei problemi anche seri 
E non ragionava male

Non so se hai presente 
Una puttana ottimista e di sinistra
Non abbiamo fatto niente
Ma son rimasto solo
Solo come un deficiente

Girando ancora un poco ho incontrato 
Uno che si era perduto
Gli ho detto che nel centro di Bologna 
Non si perde neanche un bambino
Mi guarda con la faccia un po' stravolta 
E mi dice ""Sono di Berlino""

Berlino, ci son stato con Bonetti
Era un po' triste e molto grande
Però mi sono rotto
Torno a casa e mi rimetterò in mutande

Prima di salir le scale mi son fermato 
A guardare una stella
Sono molto preoccupato 
Il silenzio m'ingrossava la cappella
Ho fatto le mie scale tre alla volta 
Mi son steso sul divano
Ho chiuso un poco gli occhi
E con dolcezza è partita la mia mano",Disperato Erotico Stomp
Lucio Dalla,"E' bruciato
Anche l'ultimo fiore
Grigio fumo
H il colore del sole
Sono solo
In un mondo che tace
Finalmente h scoppiata la pace
Aspettavo
Che venisse il momento
Ora parlo
Solamente col vento
Finalmente
Questo mondo h piy bello

Piy non odia il fratello

Cosa farr
Non lo so
Cosa dirr
Niente, niente, niente

Son salito
Su di un tram che non parte
Sto seduto
Come sempre in disparte

Tutto quello che dico
Ho paura
Io mi sento nemico

Non lo so
Cosa dirr

Lucio Dalla,"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair
All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

Lucio Dalla,"C'è una casetta piccola così
Con tante finestrelle colorate
E una donnina piccola così
Con due occhi grandi per guardare

E c'è un omino piccolo così
Che torna sempre tardi da lavorare
E ha un cappello piccolo così
Con dentro un sogno da realizzare

E più ci pensa, più non sa aspettare
Amore mio non devi stare in pena
Questa vita è una catena
Qualche volta fà un po' male

Guarda come son tranquilla io
Anche se attraverso il bosco
Con l'aiuto del buon Dio
Stando sempre attenta al lupo

Attenti al lupo
Attenti al lupo
Living together
Living together

Laggiù c'è un prato piccolo Così
Con un gran rumore di cicale
E un Profumo dolce e piccolo Così
Amore mio è arrivata l'estate
Amore mio è arrivata l'estate

E noi due qui distesi a far l'amore
In mezzo a questo mare di cicale
Questo amore piccolo così
Ma tanto grande che mi sembra di volare

E più ci penso più non so aspettare
Amore mio non devi stare in pena
Questa vita è una catena
Qualche volta fa un po' male

Guarda come son tranquilla io
Anche se attraverso il bosco
Con l'aiuto del buon Dio
Stando sempre attenta al lupo

Attenti al lupo

Lucio Dalla,"Balla balla ballerino tutta la notte e al mattino
Non fermarti balla su una tavola fra due montagne
E se balli sulle onde del mare io ti vengo a cercare
Prendi il cielo con le mani vola in alto più degli aeroplani
Non fermarti sono pochi gli anni forse sono solo giorni
E stan finendo tutti in fretta e in fila
Non ce n'è uno che ritorni
Balla non aver paura se la notte è fredda e scura
Non pensare alla pistola che hai puntato contro
Balla alla luce di mille sigarette e di una luna
Che ti illumina a giorno balla il mistero
Di questo mondo che brucia in fretta quello che ieri era vero
Dammi retta non sarà vero domani
Ferma con quelle tue mani il treno Palermo-Francoforte
Per la mia commozione c'è una ragazza al finestrino
Gli occhi verdi che sembrano di vetro
Corri e ferma quel treno fallo tornare indietro
Balla anche per tutti i violenti veloci di mano e coi coltelli
Accidenti se capissero vedendoti ballare di essere
Morti da sempre anche se possono respirare
Vola e balla sul cuore malato illuso sconfitto poi abbandonato
Senza amore dell'uomo che confonde la luna con il sole
Senza avere coltelli in mano ma nel suo povero cuore
Allora vieni angelo benedetto prova a mettere i piedi sul suo petto
E stancarti a ballare al ritmo del motore ed alle grandi parole
Di una canzone canzone d'amore ecco il mistero
Sotto un cielo di ferro e di gesso l'uomo riesce ad amare lo stesso
Ama davvero senza nessuna certezza
Che commozione che tenerezza",Balla Balla Ballerino
Lucio Dalla,"Chissà chissà domani
Su che cosa metteremo le mani
Se si potrà contare ancora le onde del mare
E alzare la testa
Non esser così seria, rimani

I russi, i russi, gli americani
No lacrime non fermarti fino a domani
Sarà stato forse un tuono
Non mi meraviglio
È una notte di fuoco
Dove sono le tue mani
Nascerà e non avrà paura nostro figlio

E chissà come sarà lui domani
Su quali strade camminerà
Cosa avrà nelle sue mani, le sue mani
Si muoverà e potrà volare
Nuoterà su una stella
Come sei bella
E se è una femmina si chiamerà Futura

Il suo nome detto questa notte
Mette già paura
Sarà diversa bella come una stella
Sarai tu in miniatura
Ma non fermarti voglio ancora baciarti
Chiudi i tuoi occhi non voltarti indietro
Qui tutto il mondo sembra fatto di vetro
E sta cadendo a pezzi come un vecchio presepio

Di più, muoviti più fretta di più, benedetta
Più su, nel silenzio tra le nuvole, più su
Che si arriva alla luna, sì la luna
Ma non è bella come te questa luna
È una sottana americana
Allora su mettendoci di fianco, più su
Guida tu che sono stanco, più su
In mezzo ai razzi e a un batticuore, più su
Son sicuro che c'è il sole
Ma che sole è un cappello di ghiaccio
Questo sole è una catena di ferro
Senza amore
Amore
Amore
Amore

Lento lento adesso batte più lento
Ciao, come stai
Il tuo cuore lo sento
I tuoi occhi così belli non li ho visti mai
Ma adesso non voltarti
Voglio ancora guardarti
Non girare la testa
Dove sono le tue mani
Aspettiamo che ritorni la luce
Di sentire una voce
Aspettiamo senza avere paura, domani",Futura
Lucio Dalla,"È la sera dei miracoli fai attenzione
Qualcuno nei vicoli di Roma
Con la bocca fa a pezzi una canzone
È la sera dei cani che parlano tra di loro
Della luna che sta per cadere
E la gente corre nelle piazze per andare a vedere

Questa sera così dolce che si potrebbe bere
Da passare in centomila in uno stadio
Una sera così strana e profonda che lo dice anche la radio
Anzi la manda in onda
Tanto nera da sporcare le lenzuola
È l'ora dei miracoli che mi confonde
Mi sembra di sentire il rumore di una nave sulle onde

Si muove la città
Con le piazze e i giardini e la gente nei bar
Galleggia e se ne va
Anche senza corrente camminerà
Ma questa sera vola
Le sue vele sulle case sono mille lenzuola

Ci sono anche i delinquenti
Non bisogna avere paura ma stare un poco attenti
A due a due gli innamorati
Sciolgono le vele come i pirati

E in mezzo a questo mare
Cercherò di scoprire quale stella sei
Perché mi perderei
Se dovessi capire che stanotte non ci sei

È la notte dei miracoli fai attenzione
Qualcuno nei vicoli di Roma
Ha scritto una canzone
Lontano una luce diventa sempre più grande
Nella notte che sta per finire
E la nave che fa ritorno
Per portarci a dormire",La Sera Dei Miracoli
Lucio Dalla,"Caro amico ti scrivo 
Così mi distraggo un po' 
E siccome sei molto lontano 
Più forte ti scriverò 

Da quando sei partito 
C'è una grossa novità
L'anno vecchio è finito ormai 
Ma qualcosa ancora qui non va

Si esce poco la sera 
Compreso quando è festa 
E c'è chi ha messo dei sacchi di sabbia vicino alla finestra
E si sta senza parlare per intere settimane 
E a quelli che hanno niente da dire del tempo ne rimane

Ma la televisione ha detto che il nuovo anno 
Porterà una trasformazione 
E tutti quanti stiamo già aspettando
Sarà tre volte Natale e festa tutto il giorno 
Ogni Cristo scenderà dalla croce 
E anche gli uccelli faranno ritorno

Ci sarà da mangiare e luce tutto l'anno 
Anche i muti potranno parlare 
Mentre i sordi già lo fanno

E si farà l'amore ognuno come gli va 
Anche i preti potranno sposarsi 
Ma soltanto a un a certa età
E senza grandi disturbi qualcuno sparirà
Saranno forse i troppi furbi 
E i cretini di ogni età

Vedi caro amico cosa ti scrivo e ti dico 
E come sono contento di essere qui in questo momento
Vedi, vedi, vedi, vedi
Vedi caro amico cosa si deve inventare 
Per poter riderci sopra 
Per continuare a sperare

E se quest'anno poi passasse in un istante 
Vedi amico mio come diventa importante 
Che in questo istante ci sia anch'io

L'anno che sta arrivando tra un anno passerà
Io mi sto preparando 
È questa la novità",L' Anno Che Verrà
Lucio Dalla,"Cosa ho davanti, non riesco più a parlare 
Dimmi cosa ti piace, non riesco a capire, dove vorresti andare 
Vuoi andare a dormire 
Quanti capelli che hai, non si riesce a contare 
Sposta la bottiglia e lasciami guardare 
Se di tanti capelli, ci si può fidare 

Conosco un posto nel mio cuore 
Dove tira sempre il vento 
Per i tuoi pochi anni e per i miei che sono cento 
Non c'è niente da capire, basta sedersi ed ascoltare 
Perché ho scritto una canzone per ogni pentimento 
E debbo stare attento a non cadere nel vino 
O finir dentro ai tuoi occhi, se mi vieni più vicino 

La notte ha il suo profumo e puoi cascarci dentro 
Che non ti vede nessuno 
Ma per uno come me, poveretto, che voleva prenderti per mano 
E cascare dentro un letto 
Che pena che nostalgia 
Non guardarti negli occhi e dirti un'altra bugia 
Almeno non ti avessi incontrato 
Io che qui sto morendo e tu che mangi il gelato 

Tu corri dietro al vento e sembri una farfalla 
E con quanto sentimento ti blocchi e guardi la mia spalla 
Se hai paura a andar lontano, puoi volarmi nella mano 
Ma so già cosa pensi, tu vorresti partire 
Come se andare lontano fosse uguale a morire 
E non c'è niente di strano ma non posso venire 

Così come una farfalla ti sei alzata per scappare 
Ma ricorda che a quel muro ti avrei potuta inchiodare 
Se non fossi uscito fuori per provare anch'io a volare 
E la notte cominciava a gelare la mia pelle 
Una notte madre che cercava di contare le sue stelle 
Io li sotto ero uno sputo e ho detto ""Olé"" sono perduto 

La notte sta morendo 
Ed è cretino cercare di fermare le lacrime ridendo 
Ma per uno come me l'ho già detto 
Che voleva prenderti per mano e volare sopra un tetto 

Lontano si ferma un treno 
Ma che bella mattina, il cielo è sereno 
Buonanotte, anima mia 
Adesso spengo la luce e così sia",Cara
Lucio Dalla,"Qui dove il mare luccica
E tira forte il vento
Su una vecchia terrazza
Davanti al Golfo di Surriento
Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza
Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce
E ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assaje
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint' 'e 'vvene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Pensò alle notti là in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
Nella bianca scia di un'elica
Sentì il dolore nella musica
Si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da una nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte
Guardò negli occhi la ragazza
Quelli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso uscì una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assaje
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint' 'e 'vvene sai

Potenza della lirica
Dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano
Così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole 
Confondono i pensieri
Così diventa tutto piccolo
Anche le notti là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita
Come la scia di un'elica
Ma sì, è la vita che finisce
Ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice
E ricominciò il suo canto

Te voglio bene assaje
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint' 'e 'vvene sai

Te voglio bene assaje
Ma tanto tanto bene sai

Lucio Dalla,"Telefonami tra vent'anni
Io adesso non so cosa dirti
Amore non so risponderti
E non ho voglia di capirti

Invece pensami tra vent'anni pensami
Io con la barba più bianca
E una valigia in mano
Con la bici da corsa
E gli occhiali da sole
Fermo in qualsiasi posto del mondo
Chi sa dove
Tra miliardi miliardi di persone
A bocca aperta senza parole
Nel vedere una mongolfiera
Che si alza piano piano
E cancella dalla memoria
Tutto quanto il passato
Anche linee della mano
Mentre dall'alto un suono
Come un suono prolungato
Di un pensiero che è appena nato
Si avvicina e scende giù

Ah io sarei uno stronzo
Quello che guarda troppo la televisione!
Beh qualche volta lo sono stato
Importante è avere in mano la situazione
Non ti preoccupare
Di tempo per cambiare ce n'è

Così ripensami tra vent'anni ripensami
Vestito da torero
Una torta in mano
L'orecchio puntato verso il cielo
Verso quel suono lontano lontano
Ma ecco che si avvicina

Con un salto siamo nel duemila
Alle porte dell'universo
Importante è non arrivarci in fila
Ma tutti quanti in modo diverso
Ognuno con i suoi mezzi
Magari arrivando a pezzi
Su una vecchia bicicletta da corsa
Con gli occhiali da sole
Il cuore nella borsa

Impara il numero a memoria
Poi riscrivilo sulla pelle
Se telefoni tra vent'anni
Butta i numeri fra le stelle

Sotto un cielo di tutte le stelle
Di un'inquietante primavera",Telefonami Tra Vent'anni
Lucio Dalla,"Non so aspettarti piu di tanto
Ogni minuto mi dà
L'istinto di cucire il tempo
Di portarti di qua

Un materasso di parole
Scritto apposta per te
E ti direi spegni la luce
Che il cielo c'è.

Stare lontano da lei
Non si vive
Stare senza di lei
Mi uccide

Testa dura, testa di rapa
Vorrei amarti anche qua
Nel cesso di una discoteca
Sopra al tavolo di un bar

Lostare nudi in mezzo a un campo
A sentirsi addosso il vento
Io mi chiedo più di tanto
Che se muoio son contento

Stare lontano da lei
Non si vive
E stare senza di lei
Mi uccide

Canzone cercala se vuoi
Dille, che non mi perda mai
Va, per le strade tra la gente
Diglielo veramente

Lo i miei occhi dai tuoi occhi
Non li staccherei mai
Adesso anzi me li mangio
Tanto tu non lo sai

Occhi di mare e sensa scogli
Il mare sbatte su di me
Che ho sempre fatto solo sbagli
Ma uno sbaglio che cos'è?

Stare lontano da lei
Non si vive
E stare senza di lei
Mi uccide

Canzone trovala se vuooi
Dille che l'aaaamo, se lo vuoi

Vaaa per le strade tra la gente
Diglielo veramente
Non può restare indifferente
E se rimane indifferente non è lei

Stare lontano da lei
Non si vive
E stare senza di lei
Mi uccide

Stare lontano da lei
Non si vive
E stare senza di lei
Mi uccide

Lucio Dalla,"Santi che pagano il mio pranzo non ce n'è
Sulle panchine in Piazza Grande
Ma quando ho fame di mercanti come me qui non ce n'è

Dormo sull'erba e ho molti amici intorno a me
Gli innamorati in Piazza Grande
Dei loro guai dei loro amori tutto so, sbagliati e no

A modo mio avrei bisogno di carezze anch'io
A modo mio avrei bisogno di sognare anch'io

Una famiglia vera e propria non ce l'ho
E la mia casa è Piazza Grande
A chi mi crede prendo amore e amore do, quanto ne ho

Con me di donne generose non ce n'è
Rubo l'amore in Piazza Grande
E meno male che briganti come me qui non ce n'è

A modo mio avrei bisogno di carezze anch'io
Avrei bisogno di pregare Dio
Ma la mia vita non la cambierò mai mai
A modo mio quel che sono l'ho voluto io

Lenzuola bianche per coprirci non ne ho
Sotto le stelle in Piazza Grande
E se la vita non ha sogni io li ho e te li do

E se non ci sarà più gente come me
Voglio morire in Piazza Grande
Tra i gatti che non han padrone come me attorno a me

Lucio Dalla,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

Lucio Dalla,"Dice che era un bell'uomo e veniva
Veniva dal mare
Parlava un'altra lingua
Però sapeva amare
E quel giorno lui prese a mia madre
Sopra un bel prato
L'ora più dolce prima di essere ammazzato

Così lei restò sola nella stanza
La stanza sul porto
Con l'unico vestito ogni giorno più corto
E benché non sapesse il nome
E neppure il paese
Mi aspettò come un dono d'amore fin dal primo mese

Compiva sedici anni quel giorno la mia mamma
Le strofe di taverna
Le cantò a ninna nanna
E stringendomi al petto che sapeva
Sapeva di mare
Giocava a fare la donna con il bimbo da fasciare

E forse fu per gioco o forse per amore
Che mi volle chiamare come nostro Signore
Della sua breve vita è il ricordo più grosso
È tutto in questo nome
Che io mi porto addosso

E ancora adesso che gioco a carte
E bevo vino
Per la gente del porto
Mi chiamo Gesù bambino
E ancora adesso che gioco a carte
E bevo vino
Per la gente del porto
Mi chiamo Gesù bambino
E ancora adesso che gioco a carte
E bevo vino
Per la gente del porto
Mi chiamo Gesù Bambino",4 Marzo 1943

E i cretini di ogni età

Vedi caro amico cosa ti scrivo e ti dico 
E come sono contento di essere qui in questo momento
Vedi, vedi, vedi, vedi
Vedi caro amico cosa si deve inventare 
Per poter riderci sopra 
Per continuare a sperare

E se quest'anno poi passasse in un istante 
Vedi amico mio come diventa importante 
Che in questo istante ci sia anch'io

Lucio Hopper,"Now Keely waits it out
Well she's only young enough for somethings
Healing the sick and dumb
In low on the radar, the smoking gun
We’re moving fast enough to function
Fast enough to function
Maybe it's me 'cause
I seem to think in twos and threes

So find your open door
In through the skin-tight sound
And keep that love underground

Busy scenery
So transfixed on transparent things
An eye for her tiger a bee for her bloom
She crosses her fingers and crosses the room

So catch your salted tears
Before they hit the ground
And keep that love underground",Lovely Day

But, boy, my bitches know the difference
Between real pimpin' and movies
It's the difference between real leather
And that shit at yo' house.
I don't know what why'all doin' up there,
But we really pimpin' in the South.
Every since I was 17,
I been stackin' my green:
Went for servin' rocks to fiends,
And rockin' club full a teens.
Went from bumpin' Screw in Houston,
Sippin' promythazine,
To ridin' in a 8 600 with sheath,
To smokin' on sticky green.
I'm still Pimp see, bitch
I'm claimin' P.A., they hate us;
But, me and cool Ace rollin' a Lexus
Sittin' on all gold Daytons.
Bitch, take a look around
Those hoes steady choosin'.
This is the conclusion: pimpin' ain't no illusion.

[Chorus: (x2)]
[Bun B:]
If you got any love fo' that broad you wit'
Nigga, move her 'fore you lose her,
'Cause a beggar ain't a muthafuckin' chooser.
Third leg is a bitch abuser, infamous
In cities where big pimpin' is my hoes clean.
No AIDS, herpies, cyphillis
Come catch a wif a this...
Damn, can't you taste it?
Now yo' money's up in smoke
Like you freebased it.
Now bitch replaced it
Wit' a sexual favor
But don't get mad at real pimpin', nigga
Check yo' behavior...and savor
The aroma from Promona to Tacoma;
Got my pimpin' diploma for bein' a Cadillac chromer.
Fuck a Sonoma...
I'm on a mission for Benzes
Knowin' 'xactly where my ends is, ballin' relentless.
And then my friends is
Slappin' niggas with glass chins
It's funny...sendin' tricks home
Broke and defenseless; and, ever since this
Boy been pimpin' the pen,
I promise never to ever leave home
Without my pimpin' again...that's why...

[Chorus: (x2)]
[Too $hort:]
You know, I got to tell you players what I'm talkin' about:
My bitch got bold opened a bank account.
When I found the bitch checkbook,
I didn't get mad
'Cause there was no doubt that I be gettin' the cash.
I broke it down to her,
She gave me the dough;
Do you remember what you was
Before I made you a ho?
You was a broke bitch,
You couldn't even smoke shit,
Couldn't stay fo-cused,
And, don't forget it, bitch...
Yo' whole life changed the day you met me.
Now you think you need a bank account,
Baby, I can't see
You managin' this money...it's too much.
All you do is look good...
And then you fuck.
Git my money, git yo' money
It's all the same.
The shit ain't even funny when you talk about this game.
They call me Too $hort, baby
I'm still in it.
Ain't no camouflage, nuttin' but this real pimpin'...beeyatch.

If you made mistakes don't waste time on regret 
Just keep straight pushing through all your problems 
If nothing else eventually time will solve them

As long as it's not the only way that you've tried, bro

Don't waste your life being depressed 
Find your way to happiness 
Slow down and find the rhythm in your life

From a million miles away

Is the same as the blood in me
I mean the blood, the blood that runs in you
Is the same as the blood in me
Oh my son I' m sorry

Have visited me many times 
To talk about it

I had before trying
To please everybody

Some say no no no

I cry but my crying
Never helps me none

Over and above all

She heard it all being said to her
Saw it all happeneing in her life
Like every woman
She's been trapped in this fairy tale
Find a frog, kiss it
And hope it would turn into a handsome prince
How many frogs had she kissed in her life
None of them turned into a handsome prince
The little girl made a decision in her life, oh
And she promised to keep it

I'm gonna kiss no frog

Everything went the way she wanted
Every dream was what she wanted
But when it came to finding someone
To spend her life with
Same old story

And hope it'll turn into a prince, oh
Better to be alone and happy
Then being with someone and being unhappy
All your life

Man with the words of wisdom
They found his long black coat
On the banks of the river

'Cause he never came back
In it's pocket they found notes
He'd written some time ago
About his so called friends

It read, love all your friends
But never trust any one of them
Which got me thinking about
My very own friends

Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Who is the deadliest of them all
I ask you now, tears in my eyes

Billy old Billy, Billy old Billy
Man with the words of wisdom
See them coming
Hear them talk

Never believe a word they say
He told me one day
Even behind the smile
That he wore on his wrinkled face

Everyday, you could see the scars
Of hurt from the past
Which got me thinking of
My very own, so called friend

Mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the deadliest of them all
I ask you now, tears in my eyes

Since the day we met
I've never been my old self oh hoo

You don' t have to believe in everything
I say right now
Cause to you I' m just another man

Until I prove myself to be
Worthy of your love you see
I' m not the kind of guy
That will bring you
Flowers everyday
I' m not the kind of guy
That will tell you
I love you in many fancy ways
Oh girl !!!
I've got to tell you this
I love you !
I want you
I love you !
I want you
Oh hoo hoo

[Chorus:]
I' m your Romeo
Could you be my Juliet
I know what women want
I' ve been around long enough
To understand it
But I want you to tell me
How to love you
'Cause I want to love you
The way you want to be loved
It is better to have loved & lost
Than never to have loved at all
I' m not the kind of guy
That will bring you
Flowers everyday
I' m not the kind of guy
That will tell you
I love you in many fancy ways
But my girl
I've got to tell you this
I love you !
I want you
I love you !
I want you
I think I' ll prove myself
To be worthy of your love

Lucky Dube,"I lie awake at night
And I think about it
Where I have been
And who I've been with
'Cause all around me
I see them dropping like flies
Everytime they tell us
We say it doesn't exist

And all we want to do
Just to have some fun
Reverend Jackson says
The time has come
That the holy book
Has been talking about
The good Rev. also said
Where there' s pleasure
There will always be danger
On his knees I heard him pray so hard
He said God save your children

[Chorus:]
Save us from the sins of the flesh
Things we have learned
From our good & loving parents
When temptation comes
It all becomes useless
Like an ashtray on a motorbike
Everything you do remember
The body bag hangs
Next to the first aid kit
It' s your life
It' s your world
I' m just passing through

I've been down too long
It's time to rise above it all
I put a big smile across my face as
I walk down joy street yeah
Follow me if you can
But leave all the burdens behind
Don't look to the past
It'll make you pasteristik
Look to the future
It'll make you futuristik

Holding hands and kissing
The other one looks
The other one smiles
When the other one smiles
The other one blushes
I didn't want to know
What's going on
As long as they' re happy
I don' t want to look up to politicians
They' re gonna feed me
Political bull
And I will have
Political diarrhea
Don't look to the past
It'll make you pasteristik

Lucky Dube,"Walking in the darkness
Like a predator from the wild
Looking for those who are gasping
For the last breath to take them away
Some to a better place
Some to a place where
The fires never stop burning
You can cry for help
No one is listening
'Cause everyone is deaf
From the death that is surrounding them
No angel takes you home
No angel takes you to heaven
But the soul taker comes
And takes your soul away
His eyes shines wild fire
And he' s here to take you away
He' s the......

Soul taker takes your soul
You gotta be ready",Soul Taker
Lucky Dube,"It takes a million people
To build up a good reputation
But it takes one stupid fool
To destroy everything they done
The world knows your people as
The most violent in the world
The world knows your nation as
The most oppressive in the world
Take it upon yourself
To restore your nation's dignity
Yo ho ho ho ho ho ho

Teach the world
Teach them right

It takes a million lives
To get the respect you deserve
When people see your kind
Some of them would run a mile
The world knows your people as
A nation of crooks
Everyone around you should
Always keep their eyes opened
The world knows your nation as
A nation of drug lords
Everyone blames your people
For the destruction of the world
Take it upon yourself
To restore your nation's dignity
Ho ho ho ho ho ho

If you know what's good for you
Stay out of his way

I can tell he's looking for a fight
Look at his face

So many years ago

Lucky Dube,"They've been married
For seventeen years
But you can see
She doesn't trust him at all
And you can see she doesn't believe that he is not cheating
You can't blame a poor girl
He's been a busy man all his life, just like the rest of us
One day she caught him with another girl
He said it was his mother
She caught with another one
He said it was his sister
He's in deep water again
I don't know what he gonna say today but 
I won't be surprise if he gets out of this one like the other ones
Cause I know he's the Houdini
Of cheaters, hear him now when he says

Lucky Dube,"Family ties 
Ever since they were born
She was worried about their friends
Even when they turned twenty five
She was worried about the company they'd keep
One day it was three in the morning
The door bell rang
She got up in a sweat
Blue lights flashing everywhere
The boys in blue standing at the door
The look on their faces scared her enough
Before they told her what she was always afraid of

Chorus
Do you know where your son/daughter is tonight
I'm afraid they won't be coming home tonight
Ever since she was brought to this home
She's been cursing every woman with a child
She says they brought to this world the curse
That have stained the good name of mankind

One day it was three in the morning
The guard came running to tell us she's gone
Blue lights flashing everywhere
All over again
The boys in blue, looking for her
The look on their faces
Scared us enough when they told us to strengthen our family ties

I'm afraid they won't be coming home tonight",Family Ties

Do you see the smiles on their faces
after you have done what you do best
do you see satisfaction on their faces
after you have blessed themw ith your gift
you don't think iit's much
but to them it means the world
they wake up in the morning and wish you were there
don't have to lie to gain their trust
you have never won a Nobel prize
they have never seen you on the TV
your little contribution makes their lives a little bit better every day

Lucky Dube,"No glove, no love
You've been hearing this so many times
Don't you think it's time
To be a little more responsible
Too many people die these days, oh
If you read the papers, check out the news
The numbers are there 
Every number, represents a human being
Who was a father, who was a mother
A son or a daughter of this land...oh
You don't make the commitment but your body does
Even if you're dead silent

You are here today, tomorrow you are gone
You don't want to be another number in the book (x3)

Lucky Dube,"Soldier 
Stand for the truth you stand alone
Government will cover up
I saw a man sitting in a room
Holding a gun to his head
He said man, oh man
What am I gonna do
I can't change the past but I can change the future
If I pull this trigger right now, right here
Everything will be over
Not a day goes by I don't see them in my dreams
Not a day goes by I don't hear them screaming in my ears
Begging for mercy, pleading innocent
Since my heart is made up to be as cold
As the barrel of this gun I hold
I would pull the trigger anyway

Chorus
I was a soldier, following instructions from a man
We have known as the general
So many medals, so many praises
Nothing can take away the guilt
That I feel inside me

Against human kind
Not a day goes by, I don't see them in my dreams
Not a day goes by, I don't hear them crying in my ears",Soldier

He said sir, can you spare me a dollar
I got to make in time for my grade eight class
I am fresh out of cigarettes
And I can't be late

He thinks it's her mother's
But no, it is her own

With his trembling finger
He wipes away the tears

One that will stay with me for a long time

To be living in a world where little children
Don't have to die, because their parents are poor
When we came to this world
We were prepared to fight a battle.
But we found a war
When we came to this world,
We were prepared to fight demons
But we found the devil himself

But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

It takes me along back to where I long to be

So carry me back to Texas
Where waves the Lone Star flag
Carry me back to Texas
With that Texas playboy rag

Lucky Peterson,"Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, let me stand
I'm tired, I'm weak, I'm lone
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

When my way grows drear precious Lord linger near
When my light is almost gone
Hear my cry, hear my call
Hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

When the darkness appears and the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
At the river I stand
Guide my feet, hold my hand
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

Lead me on, let me stand

Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light

Lucky Peterson,"We are amazed but not amused
By all the things you say that you'll do
Though much concerned but not involved
With decisions that are made by you
But we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
""You haven't done nothing""!
It's not too cool to be ridiculed 
But you brought this upon yourself
The world is tired of pacifiers
We want the truth and nothing else
And we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
""You haven't done nothing""!

We would not care to wake up to the nightmare
That's becoming real life
But when mislead who knows a person's mind
Can turn as cold as ice un hum

Your dreams will take you very far
But when you wish upon a dream
Life ain't always what it seems
What'd you see on a night so clear
In the sky so very dear

Why don't you listen to these words and heed

The roughest place in town

Some woman shot my baby
Left on that jokers arms

Lucky Peterson,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton, and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And mama hollered out the back door, y'all, remember to wipe your feet
And then she said, ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today, Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And papa said to mama, as he passed around the blackeyed peas
Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please
There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow
And mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And mama said to me, child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all morning, and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge

A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
And brother married Becky Thompson they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round papa caught it, and he died last spring
And now mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billie Joe

Lucky Strikes,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme

Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Who tell you fate supplies a mate

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

That I can be anything, anything, anything

I'm gonna lasso your heart like a rodeo
I'm gonna give you some till you want some more
Cause all I see is an open door
And I see where it's leading me
All of this energy, been bottled up way too long
It's powerful, powerful
You see what I'm getting at
I'm ready for all of that
If I'm not a star, you're blind

And glitter in my hair
I bought a one-way ticket
And I just got here
I'm gonna run this town

And I'm kicking in doors
And kissing your ass ain't what my lipstick's for
I'm gonna run this town

I'm gonna run this town
Run this town tonight

I'm climbing high but there ain't no net
You like to see me jump a bit
Well everyday's just like Russian roulette
I'm gonna play, play, play with no regrets
Cause I'm tired of second best
Tired of sitting, bitch
Tired of hypocrites
Twisted like licorice
I'm crushing them in my fist
Hushing their ignorance
You had your chance, now's mine

I've got rings on my fingers
And glitter in my hair

Tonight, nothing's standing in my way
There's no obstacles anymore
In a minute, I'll be on my way
To the moment I've been waiting for

I've got rings on my fingers
And glitter in my hair
Bought a one-way ticket and I just got here
I'm gonna run this town

Lucy Hale,"We were burning in a '94 Corolla
Three hours deep into South Dakota
I was working on a lukewarm Coca Cola
In the dog days of July

And my dad was a Superman stick shift driver
Stay at home Louis Lane beside him
Kissing to the rhythm of the billboard signs
As they went blurring by
Even when he would stop to pull over
He never took his hand off of her shoulder

You can see for miles
You can reach the dials
Sit back and smile from the front seat
You can chase the sun
You can feel the hum of the axles
Underneath your feet
When you're sitting shotgun
You seem pretty and free
But you learn to love from the backseat

So blink one day and I'm rolling along
With a part time job and blue pom-poms
Like every day's a knock off Mellowcamp song
With his hand right on my knee

And we made the age old prom-night promise
Put the corsage right where I want it
We found a road with nobody on it
And we didn't stop to think
And I didn't care when he killed the motor
Shut off the lights and we climbed over

You can see for miles
You can reach the dials
Sit back and smile from the front seat
You can chase the sun
You can feel the hum of the axles
Underneath your feet
When you're sitting shotgun
You seem pretty and free
But you learn to love from the backseat

Up here I see it clear
Through the rear-view
It's good to take the backseat
When you get to

You can see for miles
You can reach the dials
Sit back and smile from the front seat
You can chase the sun
You can feel the hum of the axles
Underneath your feet
When you're sitting shotgun
You seem pretty and free
But you learn to love

You can see for miles
You can reach the dials
Sit back and smile from the front seat
You can chase the sun
You can feel the hum of the axles

One will go where one will go
One is misery, one is loving

Where nobody hurts anyone
Can you feel it, do you see it?

I'd call you if it weren't so very late
But telephones won't bring you close to me
I recall the nights we stayed up late
Wide awake but still dreaming
There was nothing on this earth
That could make me tired
But memories don't come so easily
So goodnight goodnight
Wherever you are sleeping
And I hope that if you dream you dream of me
Goodnight goodnight
Wherever you are sleeping
And I hope that if you dream you dream of me
And I hope that if you dream you dream of me",Goodnight

Lay down upon your bed
May the rhymes of childhood songs
Dance inside your head

I know that you're afraid
But the heart will bring you home again

The heart is built that way
The heart will bring you home again
It hasn't failed us yet

The heart will bring you home again
The heart does not forget
So close your eyes my darling
Close your eyes and dream

The world is full of promises
And love is all it seems
Yes there will be the hard roads
That lead us all astray

But the heart will bring you home again
The heart is built that way
The heart will bring you home again
It hasn't failed us yet

The heart will bring you home again
The heart does not forget
The sun will rise my darling
And glisten off the streets

So close your eyes and believe in love
And feel safe inside your dreams
Cause no one's going to harm you
Or carry you away

I met a holy man
His blindness was his wisdom
I'm such a lonely man

[Chorus:]
You will see light in the darkness
You will make some sense of this
And when you've made your secret journey
You will find this love you miss

And as the world was turning
It rolled itself in vain
This does not seem to touch you
He pointed to the rain

And in the days that followed
I listened to his words
I strained to understand him
I chased his thoughts like birds

Lucy Kaplansky,"Never been so lonesome
Never been so blue
It's midnight on the highway
I'm coming back to you
Stuck in Ozona Texas
Out on highway 10
I'm going to Arizona
To win you back again
Last time I saw you
Your voice was cold as ice
And you spoke of some old lover
Like a lonesome paradise
Now I'm standing on the highway
And the only light I see
Is just a cold and heartless moon
Shining down on me
Never been so lonesome
Never been so blue

I burned with every stride
And now I see this anger
Is the horse I choose to ride

Well if you find it, take it, it's on me
In the meantime don't bother me

Lucy Kaplansky,"I like the way you play your songs
I like the way you sing
You look so good in colored lights
And the brilliant spotlight rings
And up there your eyes are fiery
And hotter by degree
But weary and so confused

When you feel it start to go
To feel the heat of all those lights
Long after the show
And you need it so much now
You don't even know

You could come away with me tonight
I can make it all right
You don't need a spotlight

Far from New York streets
And head on a highway
Where the sky and road still meet
And the sky out there is bright
And the moon's about to rise
It's all there waiting
If you look into my eyes
Cause here in the city
There isn't much to see
Here in this apartment
You can hardly breathe
And the only lights you see tonight
Are on the ceiling moving slow
Flashing signs and headlights
In an eerie neon glow

And welcome me back to town

And a good saloon in every single town
And I remember something that you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with those waves of grain
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee
We flew straight across that river bridge,
Last night half past two
The switchman waved his lantern goodbye and good day as we
Went rolling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
And I know just what I have to do
And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something that
I've never been shown
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue see
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee
The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
And headed out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
And I remember something that you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true

Not a piece of coal
Looking for a lover, looking for a home
Just some peace here in this old world

The sun will melt the glaciers
The mountains turn to dust
The rivers carve the canyons
What I do not live is lost

Mother, please protect me
Mother, please defend me
Mother, please don't abandon me

Only half a life has been my own
And half I never knew
Split the atoms of this half life
Let the phoenix rise anew

There's a face of love and kindness
There's a mother deep inside
And she knows a ruby when she sees one
And her arms are open wide

Mother, please protect me
Mother, please defend me
Mother, please don't abandon me

Just some peace here in this old world
Just some peace here in this old world
Just some peace here in this old world

Lucy Kaplansky,"Sadness is a little boy looking  
Out the window high above the city,
Counting statues of people on the buildings, 
Thinking that the people are forever,

He wants his father to be a statue, 
On the rooftop of his fatherless home,
So that he can always see him, 
So that he will never leave him,

Late at night in the darkness of his dreaming, 
His father's words fall down in a rainstorm,
And the words become hands that will guide him,
Through his life in the world just beginning.    

[Chorus:]
 
You cannot live in bronze or stone, 
Make your life in flesh and bone.

Stranded is a man no longer searching 
For the life he had hoped for and imagined
Courting fear instead of a woman, 
Holding sorrow as his only companion

Counting days like his money in the markets, 
And watching life from the window in his office,
Maybe one day I'll have the courage, 
Maybe one day I'll sail across the ocean.

But I feel safe in the light of my computer, 
This is how I choose to live,
Fixed in stone a man will wither, 
Running waters are the life of the river.

You cannot live in bronze or stone, 
Make your life in flesh and bone
Remember me...

Frightened is an old man limping 
Through the park on a dark December day,
He stands frozen at the base of a statue, 
And he hopes for a warm hand to help him,

Tonight he will dream that he is flying, 
Over banks of a river he remembers
His father's voice will echo all around him,
His father's hands will hold him in the sky,

Now I can sail across the ocean, 
Now I will sail across the ocean,
Now I am sailing across the ocean.

I cannot live in bronze or stone, 
I must live as flesh and bone.

You were listening like you had nothing better to do
You were feigning interest badly,
I guess interest is too hard for you

Watched the way your mouth made faces at me
Watched the way your eyes looked through me
Looking for something new you could take from me...

And I know what you are
You're the thief who steals from your friends
I know what you are and
Everything in the world does not belong to you

Were just scraps you didn't want anyway
All the people you discarded
Guess you never thought you might want them back some day

Well, to tell you the truth, I don't know what for
I've knelt down with all the others

And reach the days
When everything was new
When witches were birds that lived in trees
When dreams were movies God made for me
I talked to dogs
I knew why trees and kids cried
Why snow was white why people died
In show and tell
I talked about the shapes of clouds
And all the schoolyard angels who protected me
I am here and this is mine
I'm everywhere flying in line
Always looking for a place to rest
I hid in trees and built my nest
I made my nest of buried things
And the roots ran like secrets
Through six year rings
I found that secret places were better places
Nicer places that villains could not find
I do not lie

On that tiny stage with a borrowed guitar

Pockets full of gold and a dead man's face

I would tell you that I'm sorry, but I know what you would say

Lucy Kaplansky,"Somewhere out there in the world tonight
Just out of my reach
I hear your heart beat
It's coming in loud and clear tonight

Pounding in my brain
Calling out your name
And in the darkness something binds you to me
So that I can find you

When you want me I will be there waiting on you
Somewhere out there 
Somewhere out there in your heart tonight
Where I have never gone

You are not alone
It's tearing me apart all right
But darling what can I do
When I'm so far from you

And when I lay me down to sleep
My one and only prayer is you'll keep
Safe from harm until I get wherever you are

Somewhere out there 
Somewhere out there [Repeat; x 2]

If you're scared or if you're only
Tired of fighting, seeking shelter

Lucy Kaplansky,"There is no one else around
The road is quiet, the only sound
Is wind that sounds like cars that sound like breathing
The desert air is hot and dry
Two lanes weaving earth and sky
The stars are all that's keeping time till morning
And I turn and look beside me
And you're sleeping like a baby
And you haven't heard a word that I've been saying
And the way you look tonight
Fast asleep in the dashboard light
Well I can't speak, and that's how I feel

Open your eyes and look at me, and look at me
Open your eyes and look at me
'Cause I have and hold this love for you
Before this ten year night is through
I'm telling you
Take it from me, take it from me

We're ten years older I know we are
Than the night we met in that downtown bar
You thought I was some kind of star, that's what you said
I felt your skin, I felt the heat
As you pulled me out into the street
And you kissed me there till I was weak 'cause I asked you to
And later on on your kitchen floor
Two flights above the grocery store
I felt things I never felt before, and still do

Open your eyes and look at me, and look at me
Open your eyes and look at me
'Cause I have and hold this love for you
Before this ten year night is through
I'm telling you
Take it from me, take it from me

we're all rushing somewhere
But the way I feel tonight
It's like I""m already there",Ten Year Night
Lucy Kaplansky,"Enough with the mood lighting, I'm not in the mood
Apparently I don't have the right attitude
Do you think this is a sense, maybe that's what we need
Then we could channel some of the dead air between you and me

Dry your new age tears, let's stick to the facts
Don't need your phony pearls of wisdom, you can have them back
Don't want your earnest sympathy, keep it to yourself
If I'm gonna be alone I'd rather be my myself

[CHORUS]
Turn the lights back on
Turn the lights back on
That trusting girl you knew is dead and gone
She's dead and gone 

You've read The Road Less Traveled
You think you know everything
A little knowledge can be such a dangerous thing
If you'd look in the mirror I could tell you what you'd see
It'd be a real education, tuition's free

How could you just sit there all those years
And watch me throw away
Everything I wanted and worked for
And the dreams I couldn't even say
Didn't it ever occur to you to once ask me why
I guess it didn't, and I think that's maybe worse than a lie

[CHORUS]

I was deaf, dumb and blind when I came to you
I trusted you, you said I was supposed to
But you couldn't understand me, you couldn't even see
Your hand before your face, much less me
So you told me all this stuff about you, pretended it was about me
And I'd have been better off with nothing

Lucy Kaplansky,"A house, not a home
Was the picture Satan painted
For sweet little sister and me
Our daddy would frown
While mother was prayin'
His heart was so hardened
That he would not believe

In anger he'd swear
His voice cold and loud 
His Sundays were spent
Out with the gamblin' crowd
I've never seen my daddy
Inside a house of God
For Satan held his hand
Down the path of sin he trod

Not long ago
Our circle was broken
When God called on mother one night
In a voice sweet and low
Her last words were spoken
Asking our daddy 
To raise her children right

The angels rejoiced 
In Heaven last night
I heard my daddy pray
Dear God, make it right
He was smiling and singing
With tears in his eyes
While mother with the angels
Rejoiced last night
While mother with the angels
Rejoiced last night

Lucy Kaplansky,"You can have my heart
It isn't new
It's been used and broken
And only comes in blue

It's been down a long road
It got dirty on the way
If I give it to you will you make it clean
And wash the shame away

You can have my heart
If you don't mind broken things
You can have my life
If you don't mind these tears
I heard that you make old things new
So I give these pieces all to you
If you want it, you can have my heart

So beyond repair
Nothing I could do
Tried to fix it myself, but it was only worse
When I got through

Then you walk right into my darkness
And you speak words so sweet
And you hold me like a child till my frozen tears
Fall down at your feet

You can have my heart
If you don't mind broken things
You can have my life

Lucy Kaplansky,"Snow bound siren in the winter dawn
There's a blizzard blowing in from off the river
It's ten below out on these city streets
But the feeling in your heart is even colder

The sunrise screeching down the line
And the fog banks running out of time
But you won't be here when they creep in tomorrow
You're tired of dreaming someone else's dreams

When they really don't include you any longer
Miles from home, you're sliding down with each day
And you need a woman's love to make you stronger
And lately you've been getting doubts

A voice inside keeps calling out
That someone else's dreams don't get you nowhere
So, shut the suitcase, kiss the year goodbye
Don't let nobody stop you at the doorway

And close the shutters on this empty room
Where these crazy dreams come crawling to devour you
And head on out across that line
Where she's been waiting all this time

And tell her that you want her there forever
It's still two hours till this plane gets down
Can hardly bear to wait another minute
Your sweet loving babe is all that I need

Darling, it's been building up inside of me
Tonight, we'll go and paint this town
We're gonna drink champagne till we both fall down
And we'll find some other crazy dream tomorrow

Lucy Kaplansky,"I've spent my life following things I cannot see
And just when I catch up to them they slip away from me
I've been down a thousand trails I've never walked before
I found out that without fail they lead me to your door

And the world keeps turning round and round
It leaves me hanging in the air
My heart keeps turning upside down
And you're still standin' there

Lately I see all the signs, I feel it in the wind
The same thing happens every time that you come back again
I admit that there are nights when I sit up and cry
But sometimes I turn out the lights and pray you'll pass me by

And the world keeps turning round and round
It leaves me hanging in the air
My heart keeps turning upside down
And you're still standin' there

Since you're gone my empty arms
Have nothing left to hold
And your memory cannot keep me warm
But it never leaves me cold

And the world keeps turning round and round
It leaves me hanging in the air

Lucy Kaplansky,"I had something, it fell from me
Something strong
Like a pounding drum, like ringing bells 
When I was young
I had something and it was gone

I had something  made me walk all night
Made me run from home, made me fight
I had something
Made me feel alone
Like an orphan waiting for a home

Every footstep that I take
Completes the circle my life makes
Every living thing has ties that bind

And it told me I was saved
Not by God
And not by words
Not by any living thing

And not yet known
Another orphan waiting for a home

Lucy Kaplansky,"Late afternoon back in New York town
Waking up as the wheels touch down
Pick up my guitar and walk away
Wish I was going home to stay

Line of taxis I wait my turn
Tar and asphalt, exhaust and fumes
Beside the road on a patch of ground
Taxi drivers are kneeling down

Beneath the concrete sky I watch them pray
While the people of the world hurry on their way
I think they're praying for us all today
The stories that fell from the sky that day

Chorus:
This is the land of the living
This is the land that's mine
She still watches over Manhattan
She's still holding onto that torch for life

Back home fire's still burning
I can see it in the air
Pictures of faces posted everywhere
They say hazel eyes, chestnut hair
Mother of two missing down there

I pass the firemen on duty tonight
Carpets of flowers in candlelight
And thank you in a child's scrawl
Taped to the Third street firehouse wall

There's shadows of the lost on the faces I see
Brothers and strangers on this island of grief
There's death in the air 
But there's life on the street
There's life on the street
(chorus)

Then I got in a taxi, said Hudson Street please
He started the meter and he looked at me
I glanced at the name on the back of his seat
And looked out the window at the ghost filled streets

I noticed the cuts on his hand and his face
And I said You're bleeding, are you okay?
He said ""I'm not so good got beat up today
And I'm not one of them no matter what they say

I'm just worried about my family
My wife's in the house and she's scared to leave""
And I didn't know what to say
I didn't know what to say
I said a prayer for him anyway

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good

I generally thought I was dying

Last night I told you I need you, that's the last time I drink tequila

I start crying and verbally assaulting
Last night I asked you to marry me, that's when I remembered the brandy

Drinking too much and socially smoking
Wish I could stop an start to behave and then wake up

I shouted at you 'do me a favor' and that's when I fell off the pavement

Wish I could stop an start to behave and then wake up

Wake up in the morning and be in my own house
Do one last shot and know when to stop
No more photo's on facebook of me doing the robot
No when to leave and when to lock my front door
Stop waking up in cheese and in a bed full of people
Sitting in a cupboard with my weird bestfriend
But I'm only young so I'm not gonna pretend I

With a compass point driving ink into my arm

Don't talk too much, never been that close
Pouring spirits while I follow the Northern star

And as the birds fly south
I've been missing a small house

There for the factory steel and the engineers
Well I'm coming back to something beautiful

Are all the things I'd sacrifice
I'd trade it for the way you make me feel

Falling through the hour glass
Used to be beneath my feet along the shore

Wishing you could show me how to stay,
But I can't anyway,
Not this song,
Don't you know that I get weary,
I get so lonely but it's just no use at all

[Chorus]

You try to make sense of it you try,
But it's not really me who's saying goodbye,
It's like I got some kinda split personality,
You know nothing ever gets control of me like this,
What can I do?

Thinking that I want you,
And you know that I coulda got what I want",Trouble With Me
Lucy Woodward,"Please just let me stray,
Look the other way,
I gotta do this alone,

You're the perfect man,
But I'm not ready to go,
And settle down with you,
So close your eyes,
Close your eyes

I'm not who you think I am,
Let go, get out while you can,
Trust me, you don't,
You don't want to see this,
I'll be trying everything,
Knee deep into anything,
Trust me, you don't
You don't want to see this

I can't help myself,
I feel like someone else,
You're gonna thank me someday,
I'm saving you the heartache baby,
If you're still around,
While I'm slowing down,
I might follow you home,
But don't wait up for me,

Don't put up a fight,
Please don't kiss me goodnight,

No, you can't change my mind,
Don't even try it

Lucy Woodward,"I ain't no queen of hearts, I go through stages
I fall in love then complicate it
Yeah, you know the feeling
Without much hope just blind ambition
Pretending that there's nothing missing
I always kept believing that
More, I thought if I had more I wouldn't get so bored
But everything just left me empty
Love walkin in and out of my door
Wasn't good enough no more
Well I don't trust myself life really sucks and

First time I did it but I didn't do it
Last time, that's when I really blew it
This time I'm gonna do it different 'cause I know, I know, I know
If I put everything I have into it
Eventually I'm gonna get what's good for me

I'm just tryin to be creative
But everyones so oppinionated
Want to tell me what I'm feeling
'Cause one man's junks another's treasure
When its done its hard to measure or keep on believing that
More, if only I had more, I wouldn't get so bored
But I know its gonna leave me empty
Life, walkin in and out of my door wasn't good enough no more
Well I don't trust myself I'm gonna get stuck and

First time I thought it but I didn't do it
Last time, that's when I really blew it
This time I'm gonna do it different 'cause I know, I know, I know
If I put everything I have into it
Eventually I'm gonna get what's good for me

'Cause I don't want to live my life wondering if only I woulda, I shoulda, I coulda
But I didn't 'Cause I only blame myself
Again

First time I thought it but I didn't do it
Last time, that's when I really blew it

If I put everything I have into it

Lucy Woodward,"All day long I sit home
Channel surfing alone
Waiting for your unexpected
Visit through my window

You take me and undress me
Educate and test me
Breathless and bewildered
Then like magic you're gone

It doesn't really matter
When you come or where you go
And it doesn't really matter
I really don't want to know

Cause you're the only thing
That gets my boring life
Hot and bothered
So baby come back
And hot and bother me

Its 3 a.m. I wake up
I get myself all dressed up
I wait for you to kiss and burn me
Melt off all my make-up

Your crazy thoughts are unkind
But in the back of my mind
I think that you would love me, need me
Its just a waste of my time

And it doesn't really matter
When you come or where you go
And it doesn't really matter
I really don't want to know

Cause you're the only thing
That gets my boring life
Hot and bothered
So baby come back
And hot and bother me

And maybe its what I deserve
For all the times that I've
Hurt, and burned, and toyed
And played with your heart

Look at me caving in
You win...

Oh, you're the only thing
You're the only thing
That gets my boring life
Hot and bothered
So baby come back
And hot and bother me

Baby won't you come back
Baby won't you come back
Baby won't you come back through my window and bother me

Baby won't you come back
Baby won't you come back
Baby won't you come back and hot and bother me

I wish there's a pill I could take.
So I'd forget about you three times a day.
It might help me get through the night, ooh
I guess I'll just have to wait
And get a little bit stronger every day
Until I find the way to live without you.

You don't have to call anymore,
To check up on me.
While I'm in the middle of a slow recovery.
Maybe it's a symptom of you getting over me.
That you want to resuscitate your love for me.
The doctor says I need to take better care of me.

So I'm trying,
To keep my head together, ooh
Getting over you
Has got me under, under the weather

You don't have to call, no.
You don't have to call, ooh

I was only five but I knew
I'd rock her to sleep, say goodnight to the stars

Big old world in front of me that asks me what I want to be
Every time all I would say is

Babies, I want babies
I'd be the luckiest lady
Babies, I want babies
Pudgy and sweet I knew they would complete me somehow
I want babies right now

I'm finally looking seventeen
But something's different about me
With the boys on the couch making out
Everybody's getting high and drank too much of daddy's wine
But all I am thinking about is

Babies, I want babies
To have and to hold and to save me
Babies, I want babies
Cute little feet, I knew they would complete me somehow
I want babies right now

Right now
Someone to spend all my days with
Something to fill all the spaces
I got myself a full time job
Been hardly in and out of love
Still I can't fill the space
Other things can lead to happiness
Lots of money and success
But all I keep thinking about is

Starve for days to catch a break
Waiting in that boat alone
Fish know something you don't
They told me there aren't many of us down here
All the good ones have been hooked
But I threw back the finest one
Now I'm the one who's been cooked

It's too late my baby's gone
He got away, he got away
How'd I blow it, now I know that he's the one
But I took too long

Well everybody's got a notion
Of how the story's meant to be
But I got blinded by the stars
And missed the part meant for me
Yes I got all swept up with emotion
But it's too hot for me to face
Might of had a better plan
If I wasn't caught up in the chase

It's too late my baby's gone

How'd I blow it, now I know that he's the one

Baby, he called me baby
When we were planning our registry
In tennis doubles and in couple's therapy
I'd make a special kind of wish list for Christmas
In our Casa Suburbia
And the neighbors would say that they can't possibly go
To bed and read

He got away, he got away
It's too late my baby's gone
He got away, he got away
I could kick myself, 'cuz yeah, I was horribly wrong

It lights a spark, leaves a residue
It burns in me, all the embers of you
It's a darkest lullaby, tucks me in but still I lie awake
'Cuz that morning sun will rise
And I hope I'm not the same as yesterday

Yes I'm hard on myself but that's just the way I am

Click, click
DTP nigga!

I started with ten mack tens
And ten clips and ten pens
Got ten times richer in the span of ten years
Bitch I'm ten times two on a scale of one to ten
I'll battle ten crews with the strength of ten men

At nine, I was into crime, sex, and drugs
Pushin' an '89 Box Chevy sittin' on dubs
Nine thugs all ski masks, black suited with gloves
Break the imprinted chest with at least nine slugs

Man I ate eight clips with eight chicks
Watching eight flicks
You's 8-6 if you ate pussy with fake lips
I figure eight when my mind goes in circles
Did I do that or was it Mystikal and Urkel?

On to 7 AK 47, so what?
I got seven hoes stoppin' by at seven to fuck
Then put seven in your chest seven days a week
And add a foot for good measure you'll be seven feet deep

It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door
These DTP niggas come ready for war
So don't start the fucking game
If you won't settle the score

I got six hoes distributing on six blocks
It's blistering from cops tryin' to stop these rocks from distributing
Six gun shots left
One pint of Vodka before this pimp will hit
It's street justice, now it's six hole in your casket

Give me a high five and I'll put that nine lower than your esophagus
Then smack you so hard that you have to come with 2Pacalypse
Five stars, twenty rims, five cars
I'd add more but I had to subtract one from five bars

I got four forty-fours on a rip on the floor
For you niggas talkin' shit
I'm fixin' to show you what for
I did four months in the bing instead of a hearst
Now it's DTP for life, dog for better or worse

I fuck three best friends
Ran on all three the same game
In these streets I'm a murderer
I got three alias names
I'm three times insane
Three shots will cave your brain
On 3 fire and ready, cock back and aim

It goes 10-9-8-7-6-5-4
3-2-murder 1 lyrics at your door
These DTP niggas come ready for war
So don't start the fucking game
If you won't settle the score

I'm packing two twenty-twos and twice the ammunition
But at Friday the 13th
What's up now superstition?
I'm a two timer with a couple of twins
Double jeopardy
With a pair of two deuces in the two seater Benz

I got one motto get dough till your gone
I got one main lady the rest of y'all is hoes
I'm numero uno with one more before I go
If you think I ain't the one bitch you too slow

And all you zero ass niggas ain't nothin' to me
Because I chop up O's, move dro', and chop keys
0-6 is my clique along with PC
Pretty Rick, Calil, V-Slim and Shondrez

It goes 1 to 10 and 10 to 1
Ludacris, Fake Feeze, and that nigga I-Twain
It goes 1 to 10 and 10 to 1

Ludacris,"[Chorus: x2]
I hate it when it's too many niggas, not enough hoes
Too many rookies, not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all y'all can suck my dick, bitch!

I got a whip like Miracle Ludacris lyrical FOOL
We dirty south shut yo' mouth we rock jewels
No holds barred but obey the block rules
Cock tools put chlorine in record pools
Are there anyone like ya (Hell no!)
I treat humans like students (Fail y'all)
So turn ya books to page 69 and start sucking
When Organized drop the tracks then start ducking
When Ludacris get in the bed start fucking
You wanna be starting something Get out the booth 
And lemme tell y'all the truth, we kick down do's
Save all the H20 for front rows
Live in the bank and watch for stank hoes
Stay chromed out and that's on or off road
If you know what I mean proceed to stay clean
Light skinded nigga turn red but get green
Inhale some of that 'dro but blow steam
Love a combination big ass and tight jeans

[Chorus]

Boy you done lost yo' mind
No I've lost my virginity
And I shot click like that fool shot Kennedy
What's the remedy Hennessey Coke
If you cut all your money you'd still be half broke
Ashes to ashes smoke or get smoked
We come by the masses you come and get choked
If you take me for a fool I'll take you for a joke
Tired of fast food so they cooked up dope
So now we eating lobster shrimp and things
And watch for impostors that's been in the game
We invented the game and y'all just got hip
(Man what's that smell) Probably your upper lip!
Cause I love to walk around like my shit don't stank
Even if it's cigars and that purple color dank
Chilling in the gut with no trace of Tom Hanks
So put this in yo' jaw like wieners and beef franks

[Chorus]

I put too much sugar in my Kool Aid
And party like a kid wit a high top fade
Arrive to a show and I like to get paid
Arrive to a hoe and I like to get laid
Ride up on my back like rugs and floormats
I'm on the right page but what's my format
I wave to the ocean cause I'm where shores at
And women go nuts just like my bozack
Did you know that?  Man I'm the gift of change
Electric stoves so give me the keys to the Range
Shagadelic, beautiful but strange
Went to Magic City saw Nikki and Blue Flames
Rearrange, same broad different night
Pass the E&J and let a nigga get right
The bomb threaten dude that's on yo same flight
The highlight's that I live a high ass life

Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play

You wanna rush me, you can't touch me, trust me
Cause you way too dusty, and rusty, and musty
You better shop that make you pop up from lock up
But you tell your folks to hold you're jack up to back up (to back up)
I'm ready, so sit down or go ta' your room
It ain't nothing
A a watch out watch out, boom
Call me the hit man, cause I make you wanna call time-out
Then I make your mom cry-out, when I take your whole spine out
Then watch me take ya, and fake ya, and shake ya, and break ya
And see you on home to your maker
You should give up now for talking shit like that
But then you nothing, you garbage you better watch ya' back

(OK, OK now)
Now it's the Pastor, shook 'em, showing my moves
I'm in that 2000 excursion
Riding on 22's, I hear the boom
But booms just get me more crunk
It's the DSGB forever
Riding on pump
I stunk, or did I say stunk, I meant stank 
I think I'll take it please, or in another coffee break
You ain't, but you can pretend to be homey
I'm stiff arming these busters just as soon they get on me

With ho tendencies
Hos are your friends, hoes are your enemies
With ho energy to do what ya do
Blew what ya blew
Screw what ya screw
Y'all professional like DJ Clue, pulling on my coat tail
An why do you think you take a ho to a hotel?
Hotel everybody, even the mayor
Reach up in the sky for the ho-zone layer
Come on player once a ho always
And hos never close they open like hallways
An here's a ho cake for you whole ho crew
An everybody wants some cause hoes gotta eat too

[Chorus: x2]

Cant turn a ho into a housewife
Hos don't act right
There's hos on a mission, an hoes on a crack-pipe
Hey ho how ya doing, where ya been?
Probably doing ho stuff cause there you ho again
Its a ho wide world, that we living in
Feline, feminine, fantastical, women
Not all, just some
You ho who you are
There's hoes in the room, there's hoes in the car
There's hoes on stage, there's hoes by the bar
Hos by near, an hos by far
Ho! (But can I get a ride?)
NO! (C'mon, nigga why?)
Cause you'sa

You gotta run in your pantyhose
Even your daddy knows
That you sucking down chocolate like daddy-o's
You hos are horrible, horrendous
On taxes y'all writing off hos as dependents
I see the ho rising
It ain't surprising
Its just a ho-asis
With ugly chicks faces
But hos don't feel so sad and blue
Cause most of us niggas is hos too

Good luck, time to get hood stuck
Caldasac trap, Mr. Good Stuff
Ludacris give me 20 push-ups
Last summer, got the hook up
You know what I did
Who'd ever thought up they grew up on one of the BeBe Kids
Type of rat, sat on my ass
And fiendin' for cash
Almost got signed with Puff Puff, but I think I'll pass
Now what we got 'round here is a 20-20 twins
and whats up in my hand, is a bottle of Gin
I love women so I'm in it to win it
In it to green
In it to get in it and get in it again
You got two booties so you whipping yo chin
And I don't blame you
I lay in the sand, y'all lay in the snow and make angels
My ice piece dangle
make my chest look older
Touch it and fall apart like yo High school folder
I'ma Trojan man, BHS hall supplier
Shady park resident and southside Rider

Get back, time to get hood jacked
Gold chain, took that
World of Ghetto fabulous Dopeboys and Hoodrats
Be careful what you look at
cause you looking to long
You might go blind in my briefs cause my dick is too long
I'm getting nutt while I'm singin this song
and there is enough for everybody in da party 
while y'all hitting th bong
But y'all be hitting my schlong
you play the flute quite nicely
When teeth interrupt, you can watch as I get fiesty
Oh no, you suckers didn't request back up
Broads I seem to rack up
When I pull the gold actor
Get slapped up
Drove up the wall
Put it in Reverse
you can hope for the best, but expect the worst
You at a place like some D's on a Hurst
Its quite funny
Phat Rabbit, playboy bunny
It seems as if that's what I need
Filthy south and D's
That's why I roll in from the Southside breeze
Give it to me now

Your pick time to get hood sick
Hit'em wit a good lick
Clean out yo house from the couch to the toothpick
EastSide Ruthless
WestSide leave 'em clueless
My Northside mackers got dis broads acting foolish
And do this for a living
while you stuck up in yo cubicle
Nightlife running dis streets, it sounds beautiful

So you can feel what it's like, with instinct but no guts
A sac wit no nuts or a mack wit no sluts
Give me a full-body massage, I still can't be touched
They call me Seymour Butts, cause I get mo' ass than most
They say I'm next and got that butter love, and get too close
Follow the leader cause I'm meaner than medulla oblongota
My Tribe's on more Quests than Midnight Marauders
It's all pina coladas, no cops and robbers
Taking trips back and forth from here to the Bahamas
I hump more than llamas, get rolled more than tires

I slap authority like Gabor, Zsa Zsa
Half Allah, Half Anti Christ Superstar
Rocking the microphone with a hand like Dr. Claw
While I'm hitting trees, harder than Sonny Bono
Double Dragon, mixed up with an Abobo
I kill villains in slow-mo for talking crazy in my Dojo
Got nothing to lose, like I'm a boxcar hobo
When I get Ludacris with bridges on the promo
Niggas wanna clown, I'm Homey and Bozo
Cause in the grand prize game my life calling like Jo-Jo
The name sticks like Toto
I keep it realer than alien autopsy photo
You similar to a Spice Girl going solo
You lost like BEBE, or a dog named Toto
My statue of liberty is Rebecca Lobo
We Cop Robo, virgo
Bust ass like a motherfucking homo, como estas?

Built to destroy these kid's blocks of Legos
Lego my Eggo cause I say so
Hold the microphone, 4-Ize, I stay gifted
Manifested, elevated, I uplifted

Then I know you gonna mark my words

Just lay it on down, just lay it on down 
While we relax to the tight raps, and the fat tracks
That a nigga Timbaland put down
Oh yes, let's get it on down to the nitty grit
Don't have time for the petty shit

Get the cut up, then I cut out
Why you standing there wit yo' butt out (whoo)
And it's always in the back of my mind
Whatever the place, whatever the time
Even in College Park after dark I'ma get that sunshine
Closer than close, closer than most, then I'm all up in ya
But beginners give me a thigh, breast, and leg like Mrs. Winter
And let dinner be served
Can I get it on a platter, shatter your bladder
And put so much light in yo' life I'll make the roaches scatter
The wetter the better, I'm ready to get ya
Gotta have that rabbit like that cheddar
So I can freak you like I just met ya
Hot like a sauna get comfy like in a Cadillac

Kinda like that coochie, you wanna be my hoochie?
Better than my adversary
Don't be so scary
I, never thought that you could act up
Make a nigga wanna back up
Keep it tight through the night while I wet this track up
So we can slip and slide, make you wanna dip and dive
Tripping while we rip and ride, 'til I get you to cum inside
Got you where I want yo' ass
In the case of an emergency, break the glass
Keep yo eyes on the present and erase the past
And be happy if we got mo' blunts to pass
Get done up and run up
In the guts 'til yo' butt don't shake like it used to
I wake 'em up like a rooster
Take it slow, not faster than a turbo booster
No worry, no hurry - no pain, no gain
Better keep yo' eyes on strain
Cause ain't a damn thing changed, mayn
Sit back, relax and just take off yo shoes

Staying throat on the 'dro and keep that thing on the flow

Getting buck wild no matter where we are

In a dark ass club on the back of a bar

Check me out, look

It goes love, hate, pleasure and pain
Fo' albums in the can and I'm STILL in the game (what up?)
And last album, they don't like me to tell this
Debuted at number one and sold more records than Elvis (shut up!)
That's what they telling me, switch up your melody
Through with misdemeanors, they trying to give rappers felonies
So they can lock us up one at a time
But true writers stay free in every one of our lines
And if you not feeling I'm the cream of the crop
I'll knock rappers off your list 'til I get to the top!
Still you looking at a man that's financially stable
Only nigga getting checks cut from four different labels
That Pillsbury dough, women poke my guts
Still I walk around the streets like I'm broke as fuck!
So if you see me in your town and I appear to be moody
It's cause I'm thinking 'bout plans that's bigger than Serena booty
Me and Shaka still starving and looking for meals
And heads up! Ludacris is almost out of his deal
I'm over ten million sold, every album is CRACK
And for now I'm bout to carry Def Jam on my BACK
Mad rappers I hear you talking way down at the bottom
Though I make big money, still handle small problems
The rambling at the mouth, I don't play that shit!
I'm the best and I ain't really got say that shit!",Intro

They want to know why I rhyme like that, shine like that, 
Climb like that, 'cause the world is mine like that 
(Yours like that) mine like that

You can get your whole crews, even niggas that owe you
They ain't paid you shit you can drink some cold brew 
And throw on them old shoes and jump in the whip
You can come and find us, be right behind us and insert the clip
You hear something that went ""clack"" ""clack"" ""clack""
Somebody went down but it wasn't us
You can settle 'bout two meals get hooked up with a good deal
Start stackin' dough you can ride your mobile
Get 20 inch big wheels and collect some hoes
You can even start eatin' good and smokin' good 
But you pressin' your luck and you say wha'

Somebody goin' to jail shit but it wasn't us
You do track after track, and walls get plaque after plaque

It was yours to earn but the records stores gettin' returns

Going on worldwide tours and see your face on every magazine
Or you can flip to channel after channel 
And see that ass on the TV screen
You can pay for expensive videos 
And have whole lot of big bootie hoes
But when the shit start coming to a close 
Shit but it wasn't us
You can use your back-up plan, even call him your back-up man
And start thinking quick
You can call on your back-up hoes, even call the back-up pros 
And tell 'em to suck a dick
And you tell just to get these
And you tell just to pay the fees
And to pay their dues, and they catching those STD's

Do you know how to leave, do you want to ride...ride

Ya see, it started off in St. Paul from the street of Old Nash
And it feels so good to escape and just kick it and laugh
My clan had to bring the ruckus cause we had the cream
All you can eat over at Ryan's or some fish at Gaseen's
And I had to fix a goodie bag and make decisions and haste
'Cause soul food ain't the motherfuckin' thang to waste
So let's get looney up on the set cause I got five on the fire
Will slide to East Point and make our way to Black Rirer

Lookin' like Outkast on the spot smokin' blunts and
Hit the liquor store got up, got out and got something
That eightball, so I can do some space age pimpin'
My blood stay young off 45's Colt and chicken
Camels and Rolls filled with d's and Vogues
And playas mackin' them hoes, in dyke clothes
Comin' up slammin' Caddy doors
In Southwest, we'll take it to yo chest
And we got it locked like some niggas on house arrest

It's just one of those days when I can kick it like this and like that
It's a free day, my folks got rowdy way back
I right off of Cascade or Ralph David Abernathy
I shall proceed and continue to keep my roots nappy
'Cause afros in all seasons, they keep me warm
Some livin' that thug life so how long will they mourn
I still ride, that's why I bounce my way to bank-bed
I'm so bad that I'll knock you out, that's what my mama said

Sippin' on brandy, sunny days with my best friends
Today you see and then you cruise through the West end
They should've said it was Six Flags Over Georgia
Then underground, my Tuesdays would be packed when I got older
If I told you one, I told ya ass a thousand times
I got em' all in check, when it comes to bustin' rhymes
Don't sweat the technique cause I just move the crowd
My mob's deep of alcoholics, people label us loud because we ride

See I felt my bones jump as I crossed the road
I heard the squad was wiped up, so I flipped my mode
On my way to d-e-cee, baby can't you see
That Decatur is totally to be	b-i-g for thee
Lost Boyz ridin' around in Jeeps, Lex Luth's, and Beamers
Yo cars get scooped just like Regina carpet cleaners
It's Stone Mountain Cats puttin' it down
They played Kurupt so I just gave all my dogs a pound

Now my conflict was crucial off some hay I smoked
I should be gettin' it, 'cause life is too got damn short
And now my mind's playin' tricks and my boys actin' ghetto
Back to the see-P, I put the pedal to the metal
God bless the child that's just got his own
Since I was a juvenile makin' cash money at home
I'm from a boy to a man, I've reached the end of my road
It's Ludacris signin' off till the next episode, let's ride

Where all the pimps and the playas just dwell
We get the cash and the ass then bail
We leave a trace but never leave a trail

And women give me face 'til their face turns blue
They can't breathe, dick to mouth resuscitation
A tight squeeze what stops the lengthy conversations

I Playstations, duck cops and lose agents
I'm Doctor Love, I close curtains and fuck patients
When I kick and rip and flip an indispensable rhyme
My black ass is so hungry I'll take a bite out of crime

And it'll hurt if I swallow, but even more if I choke

You run with niggas that's more chicken then pot pies
Bok bok bok I'm shakin' your tale feathers
I got big balls, I'm a SAC King like Chris Webber

When niggas sold quarters and dimes and smoked nickels
My cars got big TVs and satellites
I got a Wheel of Fortune 'cause I flipped O's like Vanna White

High rights, low lefts, even stevens and fades
Troops, Lottos, and BKs, those was the days
Hi-tec boots spray painted witcha names
T-shirts airbrushed that read the same
Thick herringbone chain, one gold with yo' initial
Harris Photos, group shots, can you remember?
Barry him told his bitch go to the prom and die
Didn't lie shot his-self in the head with the 4-5
When she disobeyed, had North Clayton crazed
Just to reiterate dog those was the days
Fo' the invasions of haters, man crews from all around
Used to get down at True Flavas, bumpin Key Lo
Rockin Damage, Cross Colour and Paco
While playboys stepped in talent shows
Prom night, tux and Kangol was so cool
Fuck them new model cars we ridin' old school (old school)

We were tryin so hard
Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids

In 3 months we stayed in Jamestown
Hamwood and Diplomats
Played with Transformers, G.I. Joe's and Thundercats
We was lovin' that
Before they started jackin' jacks
For notes from Red Oaks had folks scared to come through
College Park after dark, Crown Victorias police unmarked cars
Be aware, Wayne Williams was out there, but we ain't care
Kids was gettin' stabbed and ditched out there too busy playin'
Double dare ya touch shorty on the ass, that's a bet
Want your Kool-Aid and sugar, smack your hands and say ""sweat""
It's mine now place it in my Louis Vuitton pouch
Thump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch
Slouch socks, box Chevy Caprice
Hot Niss, cut da whole Disturbin' Tha Peace

No comments, it's Lil' Fate payin' homage to College Park

I had a Long John but no Silver, no gold or plat
I was simply red from the years I been holdin' back
With two sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches
And set fires in garbage pails and cabbage patches
A child of the corn been wild since I was born
Climbin' over barbed wire, clothes got torn
Shoes got muddy and my clique turned cruddy
Wherever I go they went they my buddies
I brush teeth, brush naps and calm streets
Dreamin' of Cadillacs, wood wheels and plush seats
Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats
Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf
When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for action
Starin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one
Wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys
And be with the people makin' all that got damn noise, man

Down to your belly button, then I'm un-snappin' your bra
Thinkin' your titties are tryna tell me somethin
Hard nipples, colder then ice-sicles
Workin' it with my tounge, you can just tell me if it tickles
Freaky deaky kinda sneaky, Ludacris and the gang
Disturbin' the peace, we runnin' the streets and steady slangin' them thangs
But you gotta keep the noise down, in order to keep the boy down
Its joy all around, and you know how it sounds, if you just

Yeuh, yeuh yeuh yeuh yeuh! Here we go, here we go
Ludacris, 4-Ize, D.E. what you want now now now now

Check it
You see I live a life filled with chicken and malt liquor
And women that are real life scratch'n'sniff stickers
I shoot videos and get knobs slobbed in trailers
Then hit stage and break a leg like Lawrence Taylor
You pricks is all talk, and it's bad for your health
See I ain't gotta say shit, money speaks for itself
With all models I make I'm great like five lakes
You got rims on ya truck? Man I got rims in my skates
You rolling on dubs, I roll right into clubs
Dirty as home with more rings than ya tub
You think it's all practical jokes and big bloopers
But I smack bitches with no titties that work at Hooters
Just get a couple of girls that shaking they thangs
Then I put 'em on camera and cut two frames
With some gasoline drawers I'll be going to Hell
Ludacris, fuck like a nigga fresh out of jail
I got Junkyard Dogs, I'm rowdier than Rod Piper
And my baby's assed out, 'cause I rub my cars with her diapers
So you can pray for now if you sinned in the past
""Word of Mouf"" time to wipe that silly grin off yo' ass

These rap cats is soft like R&B singers
It's 4-Ize, I've worked for wings and chicken fingers
I reps mo' parts so Chi-Town could get seen
I'm a Dirty Bird now but I keep shit clean
I rip meanface niggas one by one
Or two by two, I'll take 'em however they come
Instead of a gun, I'll pull out a stick from woodworking
The black Hacksaw Jim Duggin stay lurking
Creepin, I'm in the shadows, the nightshade
You want the tail in the back or, a light fade?
Cause Tony Scissorhands is the barber, the butcher
I kill ya smoke a blunt and forget where I put ya
I'm Soopafly like Snuka, I smack hoes
The black rolls with the dozen attack flows
I rock Shaq's clothes when I Alter Beast
Power up, get big, it's Disturbin' Tha Peace",Word of Mouf (Freestyle)

PlayStation 2 up in the ride, is that Lorenzo-kitted?
Is that your wife, your girlfriend or just your main bitch?
You take a pick, while I'm rubbin' the hips
Touchin' lips to the top of the dick and, whew

Now tell me who's your housekeeper and what you keep in your house?
What about diamonds and gold, is that what you keep in your mouth?
What in the world is in that case, what you got in that case?

Ah, you just came home from doin' a bid
Tell me whatcha gon' do? act a fool
Somebody broke in and cleaned out your crib
Boy whatcha gon' do? act a fool
Just bought a new pair and they scuffed your shoes
Tell me whatcha gon' do? act a fool
Now them cops tryna throw you in them county blues
Boy whatcha gon' do? act a fool

Talkin' about gats, traps, cops and robbers
It's 9-1-1, please call the doctor
Evacuate the building and trick the pigs
Since everybody wanna piece, we gon' split ya wigs
See some fools slipped up and over-stepped they boundaries
You about to catch a cold, stay the f*** around from me
Ya peeps talkin' 'bout what kinda s***s he on
You disappear like ""poof, b**** be gone""
You think twelve gon' catch me, gimmie a break
I'm super-charged with the hide-away license plate
It seems they wanna finger print me and gimmie some years
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears
I got suede on my roof wood grain on the dash
Sheep skin on the rug, +golden grain+ on the stash
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride
We go front, back and side to side, what

Some punk just tripped up and made you spill your drink
Tell me whatcha gon' do? act a fool
Now your car just stopped on a empty tank
Boy whatcha gon' do? act a fool
If you got late bills and you lost your job
Tell me whatcha gon' do? act a fool
If you about to get drunk and you ready to mob
Boy whatcha gon' do? act a fool

Let's take it to the streets 'cause I'm ready to cruise
Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I love to park it
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
With the petal to the floor, radar in the grille
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
It's my car's birthday so we blowin' them candles
More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle
Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep
Nos tank in the back, camel hair on the seat
And when I pull up to the club, I get all the affection
'cause the women love the paint and they can see their reflection
I'm about to take off, so f what ya heard
Because my side mirrors flap like a f***in' bird
And the fools, we gon' clock one and we'll pop one
'cause my folk ridin' shotgun with a shotgun

You just got hustled for a wire of cash
Man whatcha gon' do? act a fool
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash
Say whatcha gon' do? act a fool
Now them gulls up the block still runnin' they mouth
Boy whatcha gon' do? act a fool
If anyone talk bad about the dirty south
Tell me what I'm gon' do? act a fool

I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the streets still smoking
See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is tipsy
Off the off ramp doin' about a hundred and fifty
Rollin' through east pernium, on way to ben heel
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin' and we startin s***
I even got a trailer hitch with the barbeque pit
Now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is fire 'cause we stomped you out
And yeah, we blow trees and beez, that's fantastic
So gulls hold ya weave while I'm weaving through traffic
I kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart
You'll be like lil john cue and get a +change of heart+
It's one mission, two clips and some triple beams
I'm about to blow this whole s*** up to smithereens

The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Tell me whatcha gon' do? act a fool
Man, that ain't sticky, that's just sticks and steams
Boy whatcha gon' do? act a fool
Catch ya man with another b**** up in ya bed
Ladies whatcha gon' do? act a fool
If the bottles all gone and your eyes are red

But being broke with no food is just a thing of the past
Plus I'm the new phenomenon like white women with ass
And y'all praying that I flop? Blow it out ya ass!
In New York I buy clothing, in Cali I get green
In Atlanta I get sleep, in Texas I sip lean
All these rappers wanna know what I'm getting for sixteens
Try 80, want a discount? Blow it out ya ass!
See in just six months I infiltrated the system
If you find somebody better, then I'm sorry I missed 'em
Niggas hate giving me props cause I might use it against them
C'mon, get Ludacris out! Blow it out ya ass!

Plus his money keeps flowing like Niagara Falls
We all know Jesus saves and Ludacris withdraws
I'm 'bout to go on vacation, blow it out ya ass!

And Latinos always waiting for my CD's to drop
White people love the flow, they say, ""Dude, you fucking rock!""

It's too many holes in my socks, and I'm ready to box 
Anyone tellin' me I need better shoes 
And I ain't the only one trippin', or makin a fuss 
My older cousin need some cheddar too 
He thinkin' 'bout comin' up on the lick, to get it quick 
It involves that local corner store 
I overheard him say he knew who works there 
And whatever they do, don't let the owner know 
I hope he come back with enough to let me borrow some change 
At least for the summer 
And if he don't let me borrow nothing, but ask me what I want 
I'ma tell him I wanna

Ludacris,"It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me?

It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me?

I'm still back for the first damn time
So grab a hold of your seats while I open your mind
And take you back to when I dropped down from heaven
And I came out my moms and had a mic as my fucking weapon
When I was three I was just a little G
But if you looked in my eyes you'd see the future of a real MC
And at the age of nine I wrote my first rhyme
Soon rapping became one of my favorite pastimes
Every where that I went spitting and babbling
Showing my ass, growing up then started traveling
From one city to the next, Luda landed in the ATL
Where the pimps and the players dwell
I made a tape, did shows and got exposure
And kept learning as my black ass got older
No matter what I just kept at my trade
I made mistakes but stayed sharper then a Ginsu blade

It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me?

'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me?

Age fourteen, my talent show a beast outta cage
I would of won but disqualified for jumping off stage
But I ain't care, cause this game has started to open it's arms
When I was at Banneker High School pulling fire alarms
So I could get a crowd around me, make a name for my block
People told me ""keep flowing,"" they ain't want me to stop
Was back when Big Nose John was my human beat box
We'd skip school, hit open campus and watch out for street cops
Now I'm known around the town as that nigga that raps
From the hills that made high to them G roll traps
And I was still making demo's, perfecting the craft
And some said I wouldn't make it, they would giggle and laugh
So I picked up a couple books by Donald Goins
Bout the business of this shit, how to flip a few coins
Before the age of eighteen, I was destined to make it
My bank account read Disturbing The Peace, incorporated

It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me?

It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets

So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me?

Age eighteen, I'm strugglin', just to survive
But got a gig workin' for change at 97.5
Now I'm rapping on the radio, increasing their numbers
Still Ludacris but alias was Cris Luva Luva
Late nights I'm in they studio and using they tools
Me and Puma smoking weed and breaking all of their rules
And I was krunk, all the big wigs was hearing my songs
But nobody did shit and they was taking too long
So three years went past, and I saved enough cash
To make my own record label and put myself on blast
The album was independent, it was just for the streets
I sold a one thousand copies in my first fuckin' week
Then went on to sell fifty, put the cash in my hand
All the record companies bite me, but I chose Def Jam
And the main reason that I made it and I love the A-town
Was 'cause the block had its eye brows down, ya heard me?

It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me?

'Cause life is like a big fight
I'm stickin'-and-movin', tryin' to get my shit right
My family's been houndin' me, friends they done turned against me
Kinda like they hearts was on a full tank, but now they empty
And they say I've changed, but like twins I'm just the same
It's because of my job, mo' money mo' prob in this dirty game
This industry fucked up
That's right I said it, and it's fake as ever

But if you looked down from heaven, you'd still be proud of me

This whole world around me, diseased, and crumblin'
Babies doin' dope cause daddy did it right in front of them
Everybody want to blame music for they bad kids
Sittin' up in the court talkin' 'bout Eminem made me do what I did
My own hard times rolled in like the fog
Try to think of others, but I can't get past my own thoughts
My momma, in 1967, pickin' cotton
While other blacks was gettin' liberated, boycottin'
My old man was a player, ain't no hidin' that
He started tootin' then he graduated to smokin' crack
I never saw him, never needed to see that muh'fucker
He left me and my mother stuck down here in this fuckin' gutter
I tattoed it on my arm so I can't forget it
It's in my mind and my heart so I'm forever with it

A drum machine, the old fo'-track, and a pack of new tapes
In the middle of, 1988, in a corner cafe
We made beats, and hung with old heads, and stayed out late at night
Do talent shows, fo'-way split the dough, that was our way of life
My momma stayed, home full time so she could raise me
Knowin' without a, household father, things could get crazy
Sometimes I listened, sometimes I thought I knew it all
But nevertheless, momma was with me through it all
I graduated out of nothin', not out of school, it was like
Tweleve, thirteen, fourteen years I'm thinkin' cool
I might as well, be focusin' on me tryin' to get paid
Usin' these rhymes I've been writin' since in the seventh grade
Our team played, and had physical sex with minimum wage
It was just like a piece of pussy
It fucked me long as I stayed

Ludacris,"Hi, my name's Ludacris, and I'm high as giraffe pussy
And I'm close to the edge, so yo' parents can come push me
I curse so much just to get on they nerves
I got kids ""Actin' a Fool"" from the traps to the burbs

My filthy mouth, it won't fight cavities or beat plaque
So I shot the tooth fairy and took my old teeth back
I'll take a shit on the equator, the size of a crater
And make government officials breathe harder than Darth Vader

It's the chicken and the beer that makes Luda keep rappin'
But no pork on my fork, I don't even speak pig Latin
I go fishin' on my lake, with yo' bitch as the bait
Plus I eat many MC's, but I don't gain no weight

The number one chief rocka, clean out yo' rap lockers
I'm as stiff as a board, y'all more shook than maracas
But my trick ain't for kids, if you dig 'em, you'll get smacked
I'll clock ya, I'll spring forward, you fall back

Every album that I drop has got more than ten bangers
That's cause I'm a shot caller, y'all fools is Crank Yankers
Ain't a damn thing changed but the ice on my chain
To get chicks from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine

Now I roll up torpedoes, get blunted with Rastas
For a hefty fee, I'm on your record like Bob Costas
I own so many jerseys I'm a throwback mess
I hit the cleaners and tell 'em I want a full court press

So momma toast your glass while I'm countin' my cash
'Cause every single is a smash, I'm hot as a camel's ass
The competition never just want to admit that they lost
And that they last about as long as my part in the wash

From yo' car to a crap game, no one rolls wit' you
One of Mini-Me's shoes got more sole than you
So by the time you figure out why your record ain't spinnin'
I'm in the strip club smokin', with President Clinton

So stand clear of the long sideburns and goatee
They may the mold of the penis enlarger off me
I'll be in another room when I hit from the back
Not to mention my refrigerator's taller than Shaq

So yippie-kay-yay, yippie-yie-yie-yo
If you can't swim, don't smoke my hydro
I've been lookin' for a woman just to put my stamp on
But a lot of y'all are mo' stuck up than tampons

So wash all ya sins away and stop playin'
If God's line is busy you might have to two-way him
Then catch me in your backyard, playin' croquet
And when I'm drunk tell them kids, ""Drugs are bad, mmm'kay?""

Or watch me swing my chain at the Roscoe's off Pico
Got seven cars, get all my rims at Chrome Depot
And people think I'm bad, they say ""Oooh he's so evil!""
'Cause I go on blind dates, with actual blind people

But my album's out the store, yours be on the shelf
I heard you masturbate a lot, so y'all keep to yourself
'Cause these women want a man that stay up and stay strong
Like the NBA, you gotta play hard or go home

All that shit that y'all talkin', y'all can pop it to them
'Cause Ludacris will beat you down with a prosthetic limb
I put my foot so deep in yo' ass that you can smell it
And yo' breath will turn to Foot Locker water repellent

I'm the man, I got money far as the eyes can see
And I'm in a group, I split dough with me, me and me
So much money in my jewelry that I'm damn near sorry
So I'm a trade my earrings in, and get a Ferrari

I buy cars with straight cash, have meetings with Donald Trump
y'all meet with Honda, no payments for 12 months
Take a look at yo' life and no wonder you so sad
Y'all put up with more shit than a colostomy bag, fool!",Hip Hop Quotables
Ludacris,"Fresh off the streets, just finished a show in Long Beach
Ready to relax, kick up my feet
Maybe smoke a blunt or two, that's what I want to do
Broke out and called up the homeboy Snoop (What happenin' nephew?)
Oh, nothin' just called, lookin' for some women who can fondle my balls
(Well you hit the right dogg, I can help you with that
Gimme 15 minutes, and I hit you right back)
Off to the hotel, I was ready indeed
Slapped the button in the 'llac to control the speed
Put one up in the air, the cops just stared
Waved my hands out the roof like I just ain't care
Got to the tele and I slid through the door
On to the elevator, hit the penthouse floor
And what would happen next only time could tell
'Cause I got up to my room, and I was mad as hell (Ah! Damn!)

Who let these hoes in my room? (These hoes)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Did you let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (I wanna know)
Who let these hoes in my room?

Now it was five B.A.P hoes and they look like trash
But one was midget, so we'll just say four and a half
I was stuck speechless, couldn't believe my eyes
What'd I do to deserve this unpleasant surprise?
And I was thinkin' to myself, ""This is just my luck""
Then my nigga bust in like ""What the fuck!?""
(Oh shit it's Snoop!)

Who in the hell let them booger bears out they cell (Not me)
And what they doin' in ya' room? Nigga make 'em bail (Yeah)
Got some fine bitches, dime bitches on they way (Okay)
And told security, ""Let 'em in, with no delay"" (Ha Ha!)
So when they get here, they'll probably be like half naked
Don't mean to trip out, but bitch y'all got to dip out (Dip Out!)
Catch the elevator up one floor
Presidential with the slidin' key for the door (Oh No!)
What the fuck goin' on? Shit, all around the world Luda, then it's the same song
Them bitches was so ugly, I told 'em to go home

Who let these hoes in my room? (Man who let these hoes in my room man?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Did you let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Who let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room?

Now, these chicks wouldn't leave, they was ready to clown
One was 5'6 and weighed three hundred pounds
(No she didn't come through with a thong on
She did for the hell of it, big fat whale of it)
You can't separate me, I'ma separate you
Bitch ya' pussy smell like Pepe Le Pew
(You filthy, nasty, sick in the head
Sitting in my dressing room with dick on ya' brain)
She said ""I want you to climb in this underwear, silly""
But I was turned off by her tupper-ware titties
(Fake bitches, break bitches, make bitches
Kick rocks, when they fucked up in they face
Tick-tock, you gots to get up out my space
Hey Ludacris let's get the fuck up out this place, let's bounce)
Then it got to my head, and something reminded me
I know who let 'em in, it was Bill O'Reilly (Faggot)
(Ya' white bread, chicken-shit nigga!)

Who let these hoes in my room? (Who let these hoes in my room?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Did you let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (I need to know, who let these hoes in)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Ay, y'all gotta go)",Hoes in My Room

I tried to kick the habit, but it keep calling me

I want everybody to stand up and be counted tonight
Brothers and Sisters if you know you got your thing together
I want you to stand on up, now I got somethin' to tell ya'
I told ya' how to think about it, now I want to tell how to get the thing together
So come on now and get up to it y'all

The incredible, untouchable nigga spittin' venom out his body wit' the dopest flows
And wonder why the line's around the corner
Cause the little motherfucker has the dopest shows
So one time for my independent women and all the single mothers who be gettin' that cake
Two times for my dogs pullin' triggers
And my niggaz in the kitchen that be flippin' that weight
East coast, west coast, mid west, dirty south
Then we took it all around the world
I got fans in retirement homes, to teenagers, to little bitty boys ans girls
Droppin' lyrical bombs up in ya' hood,
Non-stoppin', I'ma hit 'em till the block explode
Hip hop, R&B, Pop-tart, what you want?
I even got a little rock 'n' roll
The most creative, original, got 'em takin' subliminal

Cause they can't get what I got's
They want it so bad, four million dollar pad
And enough to retire off two albums, gone, wave ya' white flags, I'm hot!
And everytime I rhyme I'm puttin' rappers in the ground
Wit' lines that got 'em hooked like dope
They gotta make up they mind, because they runnin' outta time
And I'm about to make 'em choke
Better turn your stereo louder, listen up and let me preach
Let's get arrested for Disturbin' the Peace! (C'mon)

Man! This Disturbin' Tha Peace shit gettin' on my nerves
Boy I tell you the truth, know what I'm sayin'?
While he doin' shows, I'm in these streets, know what I'm sayin'?
While he on tv, I'm in these streets
And then my broad, my kid walkin' around singin' it
Boy, if they sing another verse, boy I swear
Know what I'm sayin'? I'm on another level though
I gotta car wash, I gotta shop on O' National
I got my own record label, you heard of us
The Posse Family Cartel, you know what I'm sayin', we real
Who this nigga thing he is?

I'ma house hold name, wit' game spittin' outta my mouth at all times
I spit it out and about, and spit outta the south,until they recognize the danger signs
So feel a tingle in yo' s-spine, by the way I talk
And it's pimpin' in my blood, you can tell by the way I walk
Oh lawd, more styles than a barber shop, call the cops
People in the way want to baller block
Little do they know that I'm callin' shots
And I'm not to be fucked with
If you see me comin' 'round the corner, then duck quick, perpetrators can suck dick
I tried to tell 'em, but they don't want to listen
I tried to shine 'em, but they don't want to glisten, while the high hat keeps on tickin'
And the kick drum keep on pumpin', I'm dumpin' on the closest fools
Cause rules were made to be broken, but you can't make broken rules
Hear what I'm sayin' or heard what I said
Hear what they playin', 'cause through this music I'ma still be heard if I'm dead
Call ya' producers, 'cause I'm hurtin' these beats
I said it once, I'll say it twice, biatch, Disturbin' Tha Peace

Hit by the Neptunes, hit by guitars
Afro, picks, afro, chicks
I let my ""Soul Glow"" from my afro, dick
Rabbit out the hat pulling afro, tricks
Afro-American afro, thick
Overall country, overall jeans
Overall Georgia, we overall clean
""Southern Hospitality"" or overall mean
Overall triple, overall beams
Thugged out niggas wear thugged out, chains
Thugged out blocks playing thugged out, games
All black tinted up thugged out, Range
DTP stay doing thugged out, thangs

Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy popping on a handstand

On a handstand
On my American bandstands
Summer-salts, cartwheels bitch just keep on dancing
Chinese splits-splits slide on down that pole-pole
And feel this dick-dick getting out of control-trol
Oh no keep going till a nigga like me say stop
Let it kiss the sky and then make it drop
Tuck and twist if you don't like it, you're fuckin' Cris
I'm rubbing clits so stay and catch don't try to duck and miss
Do your stretches don't pull no hamstrings
You got me moving, in fact you doing the damn thing
Stronger muscles exercise every part of your body hurts
Let's do this sweating, thank God your bath and body works
I like a woman that makes her own doe, don't need a lot of help
But your heart'll melt if I put a thousand in your garder belt
Lip gloss traces, your pierced in 11 places
And your lips downtown just made some familiar faces like whoa!

Trying ta be that bitch, can't no bitch come fuck wit me
When I pop that Cris I'm only business and bubbly
When I'm in the 6 wit 20's spinning I'm luxury
'Cause I got that head game
Fuckin' up that bed frame
But don't get me wrong, shawty gon' let that lead aim
Better learn that game shawty
Better get your man shawty
'Fore he end up tamed and be gone all in the brain shawty
This here be futuristic
This business so explicit
The way I break it down for you bitches, it's so explicit
Let it go now front, back, watch me drop it like that
Show me where the money at
Boy come wit them hunnid stacks
Breakin' wit that pussy popping
That pussy dropping to the flo'
And got these niggas slobbin'
He wantin' mo', without that dope, papi can't nothin' happen

Every time we hit the club
We at least 50 deep
Smokin' purple, potent, green shit got everybody geeked
In the club 7 days a week, find DTP up in this beesh
That ho popping, dropping, Goddamn shawty who is this?
Redbone wit a Scorpio tatted on her tummy
I'm sitting slouched back in the chair, stunting, waving money
And shawty star, zig zagging her derriere for me
A bowlegged thoroughbred and said her name was ""Strawberry""
Up her pussy, shawty pushed in a whole bottle of Moe'
Reached in my pocket grabbed a G and then threw it on the flo'
""Here, you deserve this doe. Now jump on stage and work a pole""
Face down, ass up hoe, hands on poles
Now pop that coochie, you know the procedure
If you want this cash, gotta make that ass shake like a seizure
Either magic or please us
Find me spending cheese up
Maxing out my visa
Tricking on strip teasers

DTP we got them guns that go

Yea I'm all about that pistol player, cold blooded killer
Niggaz recognize my name, I dub the young dealer
You better tell ya man that with the gauges I'm nice
Ill shoot up y'all white shirts until y'all look like dikes
But I'm through with all the talking time to show all you niggas
I 2-0, I'm like J-Lo...going through niggas
DTP we ain't plying if you try to get our pen
A.K's get ta spraying like,
Bottom line that mean I'm bout it, any nigga want it, doubt it
Bust you in the broad day, on the street that's fully crowded
Find our hole and fagots there, just for thinking its rap
And tell that pretty bitch thug we got some pretty big gats
Chaka say I'm shot out, and I tend to agree
So you should what you saying if it's intended for me
So be careful what you starting, let my fingers do the walking
And that oozy get to talking like

Hammers, jam 'em, snatch 'em, grab 'em
Can the an and fuck 'em, damn 'em
Press him, man him, scared him, teared him, kneed him up
Bake him, take him, beat him up, I hate I hate, I eat him up
A-B-C-E-F shawty is you a G or what
Now it's just me and my nuts, that's all I got in this world
I'm pulling pistols out my stomach and throwing them bitches up like earl
Serving the club, head shot, scattered, covered, run, scram 'em
I'm 38, hot with a pearl handle,
And I'm throwing text like a NBA ref
I got, all gold guns like they came from Iraq
Artillery, could it be I got all kinds of these pistols
I point my gun at ya homeboy make ya own folks hit ya
And ain't taking no more pictures, if you snap I'ma click
Anyway, plus I got bullets in the clip the size of Lil Fate
And I'm webbing choppers like helicopters
You goin' need hella doctors, when the glok go

Say on the set bitch, better watch your lip that text be quick
20 over there, Tity over there, Luda over there, ain't no exit trick
Us you don't mess with, we got them guns like action flicks
Reload with the next clip, I'm the ro nigga to flex with bitch
Come on and test this, my gun I'm having sex with shit
Put a bullet in (in) shoot it out, got them long horns like Texas bitch
Look at my necklace, maybe hit a nigga disrespect this click
My pistol grip sound like this, now what
Who want that they fucked, when I cock and load the cake, bust bust
Y'all cowards play tough, and my peeps we come to spray stuff up
Y'all lives made up, like ugly hoes with make-up bra
We'll suit you up then toss yo ass in the lake tough nut
I'm wrist rocky, like Sylvester Stallone
So there for you should invest, in a vest for ya dome
Cause I know you marks planning on getting me when I'm landing
Beast the nick, but my cannon go

Fuck a medic, we goin' call yo ass a taxi cab
Bleeding so hard you'll need a life size maxi pad
So flip the script and tell your woman its your time on the month
A.K. 47 for the niggas who's really looking for heaven and a 9 for you chumps
Got killers in my squad and I'm the nicest one in my group
But I got bananas for you niggas and I ain't talking bout fruit
Ill pay your cab back with the black mack
Till your back crack, got the gat back like, clack, clack, clack
Swallow a hallow make 'em digest with a 50 caliber
Yo futures not looking so good, tomorrows not on your calendar
I, do away with the amateurs, they breathing too long
Ill leave 'em coughing like the sound effects you hear in this song
My Shotguns are cold and hard, but my Desert is easy
And my triggers are always talking about some squeeze me, squeeze me
And for these fakers talking greezy, I'm starting the show
My Oozy got a drum roll, it goes",We Got
Ludacris,"I'm never goin' nowhere so don't try me
My music sticks in fans veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin' to sign me
Respected highly, Hi MR. O'Reilly
Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin' to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (blaow!)
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so mean in my white tee
Nobody light-skinded reppin' harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me!

Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Alright)
Rappers swearin' they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)

I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot!

Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steerin' column on yo' Impala
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell 'em holla
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha
Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
I'm double-X-L so I call 'em my ""Eye Candy""
Brush my shoulder and I, pop my collar
Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars

Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Alright)
Rappers swearin' they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)

I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot!

Causin' lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards
These women tryin' yo get me out my Pelle Pelle
They strip off my clothes and tell me, ""Get in my belly!""
Stay on the track, hit the ground runnin' like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time and I've never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen ah, boys and girls
Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world!

Ludacris,"Yeah, umm,
Think I'ma try something that I ain't, that I ain't never did before on this one
Let's go

Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire).
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire).

Got a lil' bit of blueberry yum yum, and I never would of thought that it could taste this good,
Thank God for the man who put it in my hood,
It's got me singing melodies I never thought I would.
I'm feelin' sorry for the homies who be smokin' wood.
Chop chop, break it down for a player like me ye ye ye ye ye ye,
I'm 'bout to find me a woman that skeet skeet skeet skeet skeet skeet skeet,
I'ma keep smoking 'til I reach my peak peak peak peak peak peak peak peak peak,
Or 'til I'm stuck, and my body feels weak weak weak weak weak weak,
Headed down to the dungeon, wonderin', if they got some more,
Well, if they don't, then I'ma have to settle fah some dro.
But it just ain't cool 'cause right on afta, I'ma have to go
And continue on my mission, fishin', for the yum yum, but I'm movin' slow.

Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire).
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire).

(Yes) Fire, fire got me so tired, I'ma stop, drop, and roll,
Put a wet towel under the door.
Don't pass it, I can't take it no more,
Somebody take a trip down to the store.
Hurry please 'cause I need some snacks snacks snacks snacks snacks snacks snacks...
And how long will it take to get back back back back back back?!?
Yes indeed, I'm a lil' off track track track track track track track,
Off this beat and I'm full of dat Yak Yak Yak Yak Yak Yak Yak Yak,
Get on in that stankin' Lincoln, crank it up and ride,
And it ain't enough room to fit the, other chicks inside.
I'm so hungry with the munchies I'ma eat everything, in sight.
Me and my blueberries together and everything's, alright.

Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire).
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire).

Get the propane, rollin' things and let's blow this place up,
You already know what's up.
I might f had to pay some extra bucks,
But I really don't give a fuck.
Cause a brother feels great great great great great great great great,
But I'm barely awake wake wake wake wake wake wake wake wake,
All bent outta shape shape shape shape shape shape shape,
So stomp on yo' brake brake brake brake brake brake brake,
If you toting good, then all the smokers, let me see ya flame.
Don't know what you got, but my bag'll, put yo' stuff, to shame.
All the different kinds and other flavors, they don't mean a thing,
You can't compare it, don't stare, 'cause I got the ultimate Mary Jane.

Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).

Ludacris,"[Chorus: x2 Nate Dogg]
It's gonna get in ya, child of the night
And the hood rolls on
How do I begin to, do this shit right
Get my hustle on

[Ludacris]
Look here!
Now I'm a man of many talents and a man of my word
But on my path to see the light sometimes my vision gets blurred
It's all a part of growing up and seeing life at it's worst
Then trying to iron out my wrinkles, putting family first
It seems like the whole world is out for sinking my boat
But with God as my navigator I'll be staying afloat
And I admit to being caught by many foolish distractions
Then I'm forced to pay the price as the result of my actions
I'm battling with myself and every DAY it's a war
Curiosity killed the cat, why am I Curious George?
Gotta keep my nose up outta things that ain't none of my biz
And just cause something looks don't really mean that it is
Get through the agony and anger, the pain and strife
And take the necessary steps to try to change my life
I got some questions for you Lord cause my mentality's hood
So why is everything that's bad for me feel so good?

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Now I'm a only child, so excuse some of my selfish ways
I got spoiled when I was young, spoil myself today
Oh but I feed at least a thousand stomachs and how I've done it
Is from the ground up a hundred miles and running
Dodging and ducking everybody trying to hammer me down
A self-made millionaire, baby look at me now
Can't tell me nothing still hungry as the day I began
Cause all I ever really needed was a pen in my hand
And a, pad in my lap, didn't matter in fact
Me and my momma lived in one room, and what's badder than that
Was a young man forced to grow up at the age of 12
Trying to get in where I fit, streets giving me hell
But yet I give it right, back, so how you like, that
Continue doing wrong 'til I was on the right, track
Tell me 'bout heavy money I might give it a push
But a, bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Come on

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
No matter how much older we get man, we all still children at heart
We all make mistakes, it's all good

Now I've tried plenty of times to get rid of my bad habits
Living life on the cutting edge, taking a stab at it
And learning from my mistakes, try not to make 'em twice
Just admitting when I'm wrong, trying hard to make it right
And baby, nobody's perfect in this world of ours
There's plenty people getting stitches in this world of scars
But over time, pray to God that he can heal your wounds
Try to love and love again until they seal your tomb
Cause life is short if you don't know this it'll pass you by
That's why my head is in the clouds trying to pass the sky
Never blinking for a minute, keep my eyes on my foes
They want to catch me in the open, bring my life to a close
Meanwhile that's why I'm bringing so much life to my shows
I've seen smiles I'm making changes turning glitter to gold
Don't let these devils play you down or belittle your soul
Just be happy with yourself and it's so simple to grow
Come on

Ludacris,"Ooh you feel that as I take you to them dirt roads deep in your southern roots 
When nobody said life was going to be easy 
And we travel to this emotional roller coaster called life 
And we have our ups and downs 

Just keep in mind 
When you hit rock bottom 
There ain't no where to go but up baby 
Just all you about how you deal wit it you feel me... listen here 

[Chorus]
When life seems hopeless 
It make a n**** lose focus 
Empty beer bottles and roaches, helps to get it off my chest cause 
I'm so stressed and all I here is ""f*** the world"" [Repeat: x2]

Man ever since life been a gamble 
My life been in shamble 
Double edge sword burnin' both sides of the candle 
""But Cris, you can't handle the truth"" 

Don't want to face reailty 
So lord accept my apology 
Please like when police say freeze 
And I ain't do s*** 

But I'm down on my knees 
Its a crooked system but gin straight take the pain away I charge the game 
And put my problems on layaway 
A black man but I feel so blue 

So I smoke green and purple til my dreams come true 
Then my eyes turn red 
Sky turns grey 
Children slangin' white in the hood 

We call it yeah drink old gold 
Down my yellow brick road 
Then rewrite my script til my story's untold 
See I got a little money and my life sped up now 
I'm fallin' and I can't get up

[Chorus: x2]

I had to dream about a dope fiend 
And its strange 'cause he can barely write or read 
But seems to get folks about anything curious about him 
I wanted to talk to him but he was to busy fo that 

But I was more then welcome to walk with him 
As we walked 
He talked and I just listen 
He said there's a big difference between crackas and n****s 

See he said white folks look out fo the white folks but uh black folks blang wit tha black folks 
When they ain't enough black roakz 
When you ooh to make a long story short 
We need pay more attention and do things that are more completes and he told me 

You know I wouldn't say something that wouldn't work and I wouldn't damn sure waste my time telling something that would hurt you 
But you would fall for anything 
If you don't stand for something 

But that's for certain but n****s don't be listen and that s*** be hurting 
No all of us but some of us 
And if we don't hurry up 
They going to bury each and every one of us 
 
[Chorus: x2]

Sometimes I can't deal wit my daily issues 
Just being sober lifes a b**** and I can't control her 
I wish I could and sometimes to cry on 
We need a shoulder 

The government stand us up 
To run us over 
And in the hood they don't seem to understand 
Goddamn!

What's really got me wondering 
Is if its a part of a bigger plan man 
I smell some thing fishy goin on and its way beyond blowin' away the smoke from these swishers 
Goin' on it ain't much I can do about it but preach the word of telling my people to spend ya money 

Wisely don't be obscured
By some things that depreciated like what like a home to open ya eyes to 
What's the f***s that's goings on 
'Cause the constantly getting rid of us one by one Whether Its drugs or diseases or gun by

Gun I ain't no saint either I feel that 
I'm even doing wrong by usin this chorus to get through this song

[Chorus: x2]

You know y'all going to mess around and complain about slavery that was over 40, 
50 years ago black folks need to move on
Y'all keep playin wit a crackerthey going to have yo a** tied up 
Wired up to them back roads south Florida, Georgia

And they made hem laws say they can't do anything for you
Can a church get a amen and god for them thugs too
Amen",Hopeless
Ludacris,"[Chorus: x4]
In this life one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts

Now everybody wants a piece of my pocket
And it don't help when I'm screaming on these records that I'm rich
Calling people from my number now I block it 
Cause there's nothing worse then getting haunted by a stalkin' ass bitch (oh yeah)
Cause good game I'm talk it and yet you're so true some women will have you feeling blue like Crips
I lay my feet upon the path and I walk it.
I spread my wealth out or someone close will have me layin' in a ditch
I have my friends steal from me
Snatch my credit card out my wallet hit the town and leave outstanding bills for me
They say I got the cash for it and 
I can't recall one single member of my family that never asked for it
They've been kicking down doors and bustin' out flows 
They can't get me on the phone so they surprise me at my shows
And everybody needs a loan plus they say they won't blow it
All I hear ""c'mon 'cause you know I'm good for it"" (man)

[Chorus: x4]

Now don't get me wrong 'cause being rich is such a beautiful thing
But more money, more problems people drive me insane
Not giving no handouts no more so take advantage and flee
My goal's to set my friends up to make some paper like me
Put them in position and make their wishes come, true
So they can have multiple accounts gain interest over night
Given a million dollars, what you gone, do?
Map your life for your kid's kids or would you spend it over night?
Now see me I do both I got unlimited funds 
My daughters life was set before her stankin' butt turned one 
And it don't help that I got 4 or 5 retirement funds
So if I choose before I'm 30 I can lay in the sun
My dividends can show and prove the real meaning of fun
That's why I live by the sword but you can die by my gun
The IRS'll never sweat me or even put up a fight
Cause I'm sure I pay more in taxes then you made in your life
Because

[Chorus: x4]

[Verse Three]
Now women these days don't want a man without a nice paycheck
So he splurge even though our lives ain't in the right place yet 
Buying jewelery and some cars just to impress these whores
Meanwhile your child's poor like, ""Daddy, what you left me for?!""
Yeah but it all comes back that's why I named my daughter Karma (yup)
Who teaching me the lesson of life and making me smarter
I sweep her off her feet 'cause I'm her knight in shining armor 
And I have your fucking head if anybody tries to harm her
Got to teach her about the game that most of us niggas are spiting
About these scandalous ass women that get money through gifts
They suck a cold hard wood for some cold hard cash
Or ride a brother good to put a foot up on the gas
So that brand new ride pick up our friends
While you're slippin' she slides
Drop top Benz gold diggers inside
Crazy what the world will do for money
Thinking that everything will be alright

If you got diamonds and they shining throw your wrist up!

[Ludacris]
Hey hey
It's Luda Luda get it right I'm Mr. Money Machine
And I'm steady looking for two women I can come in between
You can catch me chilling up in the cut but I'm always ready for action
I'm stunt, like Jackie Chan and lay low, like {?} Jack-son
Maxing and relaxing, haters, do they really want to test me man
I got an arsenal waiting, do they really want to catch me man
No, I, don't, think, so
I've, got killers on the pay-roll if there's a, problem then say-so
I, make dough until there's none left
I run with plenty gangs that's holding things
And rearrange your frame in one breath
So to keep on breathing I suggest you take this beating
'Tis the season for bleeding and we've been looking for a reason

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Hey hey
Come holla at me, I'm a star, I got the hood on smash
You know me! My whole car smell like a wood shop class
I point 'em out like her, her, that girl with the mouth
Plus you and your friends
Let me show you some whips that don't come out 'til the year of 2010
So I'm flocking 'em in, 'til the drop top is rocking again
Boy I got it locked, if you think not, then you'll get popped in the chin
And I'm clocking these ends, my record sales are blocking 'em in
Gotta thank those blessed to walk the streets to those that's locked in the pen
My entourage is game faces, mean mugging, mean mugging
Now the media is convinced that we thuggin', we thuggin'
Momma told me grow up to be something, be something
I went diamond with this album so we bucking, we bucking

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
I'm so far ahead it's only RIGHT for you to hate on me man
When I'm pushing 90 by myself up in the H.O.B. lane
They trying to figure how many mo' women that I can take on my plane
Being one of the few rappers responsible for changing the game
Now desperate artists trying to sue but they just making some claims
Can't get in the spotlight for nothing and it just makes 'em insane
That's why some of the niggas resort right back to baking that 'caine
And selling it off to junky monkeys who keep baking they brain
As they grow older they'll be feeling a lot of aching and pain
So right at the head they might as well just be aiming that thing
And you ain't helping the process out by always caking these dames
But it is hard giving up the place where they be shaking they things

Cause I've been places where you'll never imagine, but I'ma start at home,

You are the woman that I'm really pursuin, 
I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name, 
If you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange, Hey!
See I'm the man of this town, 
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around, 
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinking of me, 
We got people to meet and many places to see, Hey!
I'm really digging ya lips,
But be careful where you walking when you swinging them hips, 
I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causing a crash 
Wit ya traffic jam booty, heads pausing so fast, Hey!
I wouldn't trade you for the world I swear it, 
I like ya hair and every style that ya wear it,
And how the colors coordinate wit ya clothes, 
From your manicured nails to ya pedicured toes

You hear the song so dance, 
Don't always think I'm trying to get in your pants,
Cause see me my pimpin's in 3-D, 
I'm taking you places you only see on T.V., 
Trying to show ya that living is trife,
How many guys you know that can bring the travel channel to life, 
One day we on the auto-bind swerving driving, 
Next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands, 
If you with me ain't no time to sleep, 
Especially at wet willies on Miami Beach, 
But I drive you off and pay you no attention 
If I make it to Atlanta's Brina Brothers convention, 
Then jump in the car and just ride for hours,
Making sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard, 
Hawaii to D.C. it's plenty women to see, 
So if yo ass don't show up it's more women for me, Hey!

While the ladies all begging me to masha tucks, 
I had sad Beginnings when I rap wit no fans, 
Now it's all happy endings in my lap in Japan, Hey
I used to think that it was way too cold 
Til I went to Canada and say some beautiful hoes, 
Now I Hit the Caribbean every year in Toronto, 
Then fly t Illinois to get a taste of Chicago,

Look like he been swimming In shoulder height water, 
Please tell that nigga, put yo hands down, 
If you smell like you been At work all day and your car, 
Please put your hands down, 
Now look up at the pinky fingers that Are still in the air, 
If you see him ashy around the knuckles, 
Like the nigga wash half of his
Hands and lotion three quarters of his body, 
Please say put yo hands down, 
If yo spinning rims Spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin, 
If you are dancing on the dance floor and you look to Yo left and yo right 
And you do not see a woman in sight, 
Guess what you guessed it you are not
Pimpin, if your Vodka and cranberry is really really dark like blood, 
That's because you didn't Order Vodka buddy, 
That's why it's three dollars a glass, 
Put your hands down, now look down, 
I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time ok,

Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (bet a stack)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (bet a stack)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)

[Ludacris]
Let it rush through your veins, cause I'ma be the one
To step up and put a hundred thousand dollars on the game
Got a pocket full of change and they see-note stacks
Busting dominoes, spades, Cee-lo, craps
We shooting pool at the Luda-plex, I slap a hundred on the table
Just to see if any fools want to do it next
I got games galore, I got game for sure
And when I win I spit game to whores (yep)
Or double it back, I'll double the stacks
Throw a dub, a big face or double the stack (boy)
And we can 'bout anything that you want to do
But come up short and oh the things that the gun'll do
Throw in the towel cause I'm making 'em sweat
Or put your house on the line and I can cover the bet
So hurry up and come get some, if you want some
You know the phrase, scared money don't make none!

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Throw some money on the books, cause I know how to call 'em
Somebody tell my fam I got a gambling problem
I don't know when to STOP, maybe when somebody's
Drug away by the COPS, or when I'm blowing steam
Counting green in the DROP, because whether legal or illegal
All my people bring the strength to the block
Yes sir, I thought you knew it, we loco
We'll bet on anything, just to see if anybody's goin' do it
It's people living they life coming up off change
And hustlers paying they bills coming up off games
Whether it's Madden or it's Live, tell 'em pick up the sticks
They call me Mr. Put-Down-Two-And-Pick-Up-Six
Then walk away with a clean slate, catch me out in A.C.
Calling yo' bluff with Puff eating cheesecake
So all my ramblers, runners and money scramblers
Put your drinks up to all compulsive gamblers

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
I'm up in Vegas with a stack of black chips
Breaking the whole casino and doing back-flips, man
Cameras eying us, sidebetters trying us
The more chips we stack, the more drinks they buying us
Trying to get me off my grind, but it won't work
Cause I can drink a fifth of gin and it don't hurt
I'm still breaking 'em, and dice still shaking 'em
I'll step in any place, just ask X what I say to 'em

[Ludacris (Dj Quik)] 
Gotta keep it a secret (woo!)
Hey man let me ask you something man
You ever have one of them days where you felt like
You might to got rid of all the bad seeds in your life?
You know what I mean like you just got your paycheck
Paid off a car note or something
Just jumped out the shower feeling fresh than a motherfucker
With ya good shoes on, what you know what I'm talking bout?
(You mean like, paid off a Cadillac car note?)
Like a Cadillac, like you ready to throw a party
Like call everybody you know, don't even plan it, just do it
(In Compton we call that ""spur of the moment"")
Well let's do it, spur of the moment, what up?

[Ludacris]
Well you can bring the drinks a little mo' my way
More I say, on another hot sunny Cali-for-nye day
Just touched down, called up my 8-1-8
Fo' a date with some other bust downs
And I cruised up the block, car lost up the top
I take the breeze, quick break the trees
Feel good as we flipping through the Robb Repo't
My baby momma ain't tripping on child support

[DJ Quik]
Because she can't support that garbage, she should come pay homage
When we pair 'em, we goin' share 'em, when I'm finished we all switch
I ain't really got the time, yo I'm chilling with Luda
'Cris stop and twist the Buddha got me feeling like this is it
If we goin' party, we goin' sip, we got a bar
We all in shape, we goin' go far, you can't stop the car
We on the freeway, if you get out you burnt
You would of thought you would of learned me when my hair was all permed
I think y'all bullshittin with it dog

[Chorus: Ludacris (Kimmi)]
It's on tonight, get licked, get gone tonight
(And for once, in my life, everything's gonna be, alright)
G'd up, my mind is freed up
(From the day, through the night, everything's gonna be, alright)

[DJ Quik]
Arabian Spruce, Seagram's bumpy and juice
We used to bag and then truce, we used to sag and get loose
Not the kind of cats that would jump in your bag for your jewels
But to put some money in it for your drink and your shoes
We get the News like MTV, every ten to the hour
We play Mario Brothers, we eat the 'shroom and get power
Now eat your sour powers, and use your dental floss
What does being mental cost? If you ain't knowing you already lost

[Ludacris]
So stay with me, and let's get tipsy
Remembering the days on the block sipping whiskey
Running 'round grinning, running 'round sinning
Getting lit, then I wonder why my head kept spinning
But I'm all grown up now, less throwing up now
Record blowed up, so my hood throwed up
Now let's break loose cause your boy's arrived
And tonight we goin' celebrate being alive right

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
It's just one of those days, without a care in the world
You ain't gotta look mean, I know you care for your girl
But she's looking this way and I'm gonna come get her
Fresh haircut, so I'm feeling quite differ
Can't nothing go wrong cause my strap's on my back
And if fools want to scrap then my tool will attack
But forget the click-clack, ain't no need for the steel
Just a straight house party and some meat on the grill

[DJ Quik]
If it's Los Angeles, watch a boss handle biz
I'ma put this on my kids, stupid it's an outfit
If you ain't been around the world keep yo' mouth zipped
Cause I do ? elevation
You see I'm not normal and I'm not a homo
I'm mo' apt to shoot a porno with you in cornrows
And call it ""More Hoes: Volume 5, Volume 6""
And show it in the back of my truck, at the picnic

Fuck with me and get found in the Chattahoochee River
This 7 inch shank, will put a stop to his ticker
But shoties to the body make him drop much quicker
Yeah I appear to be a nice lil nigga
Fuck with anything I love, I'm a stone cold killa
Eating off of 'Sace, sleeping on chinchilla
8 figga nigga, I'm a multi milla
See me in the street, it can't get no realer
Giving back to my hood with a pocket full of scrilla
My neighbors say my house can't get no bigga
I do good ass bidness, with a bad ass temper
Please tell ya bitch, stop playing with my zipper

die for his daughter, just to let her breathe
And I'd definitely die for Jesus cause he died for me
Give my eyes to Stevie Wonder just to see what he's seen
But then I'd take 'em right back to see Martin Luther's dream
I'd dream that I could tell Martin Luther we made it
But half of my black brothers are still incarcerated
Locked up in a cell block, lost from the shell shock
Some sold they soul, others used to sell rocks
Look up in my mailbox, I get letters from my cause
and every week said he wanna hit the streets
But he never struck a deal cause his mouth will never squeal
Put some money on his books and help him out with his appeal
Send some pictures of the fam and nasty pics of Shawnna
If you ever have to leave I got your mother and your daughter
Born in this way of living and our youth is stuck
To be safe it's safe to say the justice system's fucked up!

The canteen ran out of menthol's
Can't see how grown men wash other men drawers
Niggas play the phone room reckless and get hit with new indictments
Talking about old connects and new prices
Stress'll take a young nigga, give him an old face
Or stress'll take a dumb nigga, give him a new case

Cause they got mo' heart, than them fake ass dudes
They send no letters, no books, and no money for no food
Cause commissary is so very necessary
It's so close to bein slavery, in Texas nigga it's scary
I reached out to C-Murder right before I came home
And when him home, let me go I make sure that his books was on
And three months later that nigga came home too
Ain't no limit to this shit cause now his dream's coming true
I'ma keep riding with Bun cause UGK will never stop

Get 'em up, get down, turn around and put your face in the pillow
Cut 'em up like Jason, just face it that boy Luda's a killer
Half man, half gorilla, beating all on my chest
Pleasing all of your flesh, squeezing all on your breast
Giving you reasons to rest, and ain't never say no to papi
Wake 'em up like Folgers cause I fold 'em like origami
Hey mami let's get it popping like Orville Redenbacher
The way you move once you started nothing could ever stop ya
Sweeter than Betty Crocker, and I'm ready to belly flop ya
Just mention today but for now I forever gotcha

(Whoo!) Verse two, it's like this

Gotta get 'em up out of them clothes, if I throw a couple dollars then pose
We could drink a couple bottles and go, and ride off in the Impala on vogues
And Rolls, gold is all on my neck, all on my wrist
So just let go of yo' hoe, don't hog her to death, lend her to Chris
Just for a little while for a little bit
Just wanna see her smile and get the bigger fish
She said that you had a little dick
Now how in the hell can she benefit from something like that?
I be up in that cat, make her put a hump in that back
Black, I swing low and sweet chariot, meet me at the Marriott
Key access, I'll be at the very top
Don't hesitate to stop the elevator either
I'll show you the ups and downs, you'll be my elevator diva

All I need is a couple hours baby, for real

Come up out that Prada, Chanel, Chloe, Louis and Gucci
Escada, Dior, Fendi, that Masconi and Juicy
Rocking Republic, True Religions and Citizen's jeans
Your Jimmy Choo's are so sexy but Giseppi's is mean
La Pearla lingerie, ya panties and bra matching
Put down your clothes and I'll put you up on the latest fashions
Cause with cameras and action, I'm a deadly assassin
I love your clothes but what's underneath I love with a passion

But you gotta understand us rappers ain't never had nothing
And one's loss is another's gain so we gotta grab something
Lord, got so many questions I need the answers to
And sorry for the things I put my baby's mama through
I feel that women are really the strongest human beings
But why do you make 'em so emotional, and other minor things
I guess it's your way of saying we gotta love 'em and gotta praise 'em
Cause without 'em we'd be nothing, plus our kids they gotta raise 'em
While we, out and about and seeing what life has to offer
But if you offer a new life then what we need is better fathers

I'm only human, I'm not always in the best of moods

And sorry for cursing sometimes but feelings make me shout 'em out
Forgive the people that wanna blame everything on rap music
If they didn't live it they can't relate or even adapt to it
Forgive those who don't think I'm great and wanna see me go
Forgive Oprah for editing most my comments off her show
Don't get me wrong, I know some people got a image to hold
But those who criticize the youth might just be getting too old
We still traveling through life, finding what's right or wrong
I know some folks may not agree or even like this song
But I'm just speaking MY truth, cause I heard it sets you free
And my conversation's with God, even though he speaks through me

[Chorus 2]

[Bishop Eddie Lee Long]
What you just heard is real life
It's real life for you, it's real life for many
It's about where you been, yet at the same time you
Hey, you find yourself, in the midst of conflict and turmoil
Yes I'm talking to you, in the midst of conflict and turmoil
Cause you realize hey, it's, time to change right now
And in the middle of that I wanna say this
The Bible says that when I was a child, I spoke as a child
I understood as a child, I fought as a child
Hey, but when I became a man
I put away those, childish things
Did you not know that your environment has shaped you?
Where you were born, in the projects, in the ghetto's
In the upper downtown, wherever it was
The people around you, the things around you
Cause you to do strange things because, you were seeking to learn
But what you learned, was on the streets, and not in the book
God called you a prophet
When you open up your mouth, everything of God comes out
And it commands attention, it commands change
I'm talking about the power, that's inside of you
And in the midst when you're, starting to understand
That I caught the wrong message, and now it's time
I'm hearing from God, what amazing experience, as you hear from God
He said, ""Is there forth any man be in Christ, he is a new creation""
Old things are passed away, somebody needs to hear that and behold
Everything becomes new, and when everything becomes new in you
It's time to stop the killing
I said it's time to stop the stealing
It's time to stop disrespecting our women
It's time for us to come home and raise our children
It's time for us, to really mold our communities
It's time for us, not to get hooked up in religion
But to get hooked up in relationship, with God
And the amazing thing about it
Is wherever you find yourself right now, you can confess
And you can tell God ""I'm sorry;
I had the wrong cue, I was doing the wrong thing
I was going after things that I thought were right, but it wasn't right
And now that I'm getting it right, I'm asking you to forgive me
And I may have done the things, that they said I did
But I'm not, who they say I am; I am who you made me to be
And I'm changing in that, and it takes a few moments
But every time I fall down, I'll get right back up
And every time I make a wrong turn, I'll get myself back in line
Because I recognize, I have been called, for such a time as this!""
You can't resist the change
And you're not condemned by your yesterday
If you can grab hold of your now, and move in your destiny
Move, change, and be, now!

Searching so long, lost in the clouds
Trying to stay strong, and make you proud, make you proud!
Took me some time (took me some time) now I see

Just figured out that I'm ahead of my time, wit a flow so fast I'm ahead of my rhyme. 
Ya clock is off beat, better set it to mine. 
With a 6 year run havin' a helluva time. 
Cause I'm always looking for some girls gone wild.(gone wild)
I'm just trying to make these girls all smile(all smile). 
And I'm gonna get high, till I make'em touch the sky, 
Then I make'em wonder why, why why am I so fly?

We goin' hit the door. And then hit the floor, you'll get hit below. 
I got somebody I want you to get ta know, me

Y'all already know what it is 
I'm a tell you, nigga 
C.T., know what it is, 'bout 17-5 
Homey fronted me a sip, shit, I made it a bird 
That's seventeen and a half, all I need is the word 
Say, the ice is cool but them pots is hot 
You better cook slow but that money come fast 
I got what you need; I hope you brought all the cash 
You know the kid pimpin' all over the world 
A hundred carats got me all over your girl 
Yeah, five freaks and my Gucci duffle bag 
A corporate thug; I run with a Playaz Circle 
I got a Field Mob that'll disturb your peace  
Blowin' Sean Jay, all we do is smoke 
Finish countin' my bread, and I was gettin' some head 
Whassup? 

[Chorus]

[Ludacris] 
I'm a be all the way real with this, look 
When I came into the game, they ain't do nothin' but doubt me 
Now the whole game's changed and it ain't nothin' without me 
Pickin' up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown 
Only reason you on that song is 'cause I turned that down 
I went from Hot Wheels to big wheels, Hyundais to Bentleys 
And five course meals, no more Popeye's and Blimpie's 
From alright to handsome, from one room to mansions 
From hangin' on the block to throwin' parties in the Hamptons 
From broke as a joke to rich as a bitch, I bought a 
Plane and a boat and six other whips, no Marta 
From dice on the curb to stackin' up chips, but harder 
From birds on my nerves to chicks on my dick! 
Guard your women, dog 
I went from ashy to classy 
Went from a kiss on the cheek to doin' the nasty 
Reach your hand up in the air, and you can play with the stars 
It's not the hand that you're dealt, but how you're playin' your cards, boy! 

[Chorus]",Grew Up a Screw Up

I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
But you's a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind
I got on my right side, pourin' some cups
My whole hood is to my left, and they ain't giving a fuck
So feel free to get lose and get carried away
So by tomorrow you forgot what you was sayin' today
But don't forget about this feeling that I'm making you get
And all the calories you burn from me making you sweat
The mile high points you earn when we taking my jet
And how everywhere you turn, I'll be making you wet

Ya want to, but I really want you
Just be thankful that Pharrell gave you somethin' to bump to, hey!
Luda, I'm at the top of my game
You want my hands from the bottom to the top of your frame
And I just wanna take a lil' ride on your curves
And get erotic, giving your body just what it deserves and
Let me give you some swimming lessons on the penis
Backstroke, breaststroke, stroke of a genius, Yup!
Call me the Renaissance man
Get up, and I stay harder than a cinder block, man, hey!
I'm just a bedroom gangster
And I been meanin' to tell ya that I really must thank ya when ya

Please don't stop it until it hurt, girl
You, you been lookin' a little tipsy
So if you could jus' shake it a little this way
See I'm a member of the BBC
The original bread winna of DTP
And you the center of attention that's distracting the squad
'Cause everybody in the camp is like, oh my God, she could...

Ludacris,"[Chorus: x2]
Stop moving so slow
I got mouths to feed
Hurry up and lets go
I got mouths to feed
Rain, hail, sleet, snow
I got mouths to feed
So you already know I'm bout to get to that paper

Listen, look I gotta feed my family by all means necessary. 
Cause pay checks are coming up shorter than February.
Can't get a real job, I never finished school.
Can't get no new close, I wore the same tennis shoes.
But now the games changed, 
I'm all about the hustle.
And even honkey knows best, I'm all about the muscle, 
I'm all about my team, 
I'm all about my green. 
I'm 'bout supply and demand, 
I'm 'bout to serve the fiends.
And I'm a working dream
I keep the circuit clean.
See I'm the fucking future, I'm a working machine
Don't trust a soul I'm the only one watching my cream so I stay in heavy rotation like a washing machine

[Chorus: x2]

Mother fucker, I'm a monster in this game,
I turn twenty into fifty
Fifty to a hundred and a hundred to a Bentley
Bentley to a building and a building to a scraper.
Can't keep up with the news but I get that daily paper.
And you's a daily hater cause my foot game is major.
After a while crocodile, see ya later alligator.
My baby need new shoes, her momma need Giuseppe's
Mercedes need new shoes surrounded with Pirelli's
A finger to the world I paid my dues and I'm ready
To pack up all the tools and just cruise in the Chevy
Million dollars deals making moves on my cellie cause I owe it to my girl to put food in her belly

[Chorus: x2]

Wake up and smell the coffee. its time to make the donuts
A kid who had a kid, my kid made me a grown up
You ever threaten mines I won't resist to put the chrome up
My guns'll be like gang signs (always getting thrown up)
Atlanta put your zone up
We true to these streets
I got 12 hungry artists, whole crew gotta eat
So hell no I don't sleep I'm like an energizer battery
Got 19 employees I gotta pay they salaries
My momma quit her job and I retired my pops
Got killers on the payroll, I hired some cops
I accept responsibility, they all pay rent
So if it don't make dollars then it don't make sense.

Now little Lisa is only nine years old
Shes tryin' to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone, and they never met her family
Mama's always gone, and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin' and nobody will listen
Mama on drugs, gettin' high up in the kitchen
Bringin' home men at different hours of the night
Startin' with some laughs, usually endin' in a fight
Sneak into her room while her mama's knocked out
Tryin' to have his way and little Lisa says 'ouch'
She tries to resist, but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom, but her mama don't believe her
Lisa is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back

Little Nicole is only ten years old
She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty, and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic step dad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions; she makin' up excuses
Bleedin' on the inside, cryin' on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she about
Her name is lil' Stacy, and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight till the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back

Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops Ex to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin' sex with a boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep, and she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection; he's usin' no glove
Never thinkin' 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin' for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by, and her belly gets big
The father bails out; he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin' her mama will blow it all outta proportion
Plus she lives poor, so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She say she's about to run away and never come back

This morning I woke up on the wrong side of the bed (bed)
I'm sick of people putting lies in my head (head)
I don't really wanna work; I'm tired
I hate my nine to five
And I'm thinking 'bout killin' my boss today

I'm thinking 'bout killin' my boss today (it's just a thought, man)

Yesterday my best friend died (died)
Somebody came and took his life (life)
Now I'm looking up at the sky
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
And I'm asking, why did you take him away?
Why did you take him away?
I'm asking, why did you take him away? (Why'd you take him?)

Is it 'cause I'm wasting my time away

Is it 'cause I'm wasting my time away (too lazy)
Wasting my time away? (I can't help it)

My grand mama's nerves are bad (bad)

It's about to be some grown folks talking here, okay?
All right

Yeah, things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be (okay)
Like all these faking ass rappers in this industry (tell 'em!)
Talking 'bout what they got and they ain't got a damn thing
How you own three cars but you don't own your own name? (woo!)
Get your business right boys, the first class is in session (okay)
Get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession (hey!)
Start up your own company, trademark the name
That's goin' run ya about a grand so start saving your change (DTP!)
Open a bank account quick and then follow these steps (uh-huh)
Sign yourself TO yourself and start signing ya own checks (woo!)
Hit the booth and start recording at the speed and need
Whatever gets your juices flowing, could be speed or weed (what else?)
Get it mixed and mastered (hey) pressed up and plastered (okay)
Sell it to your whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard!
Show all the non-believers what you destined to be (hey!)
And in just a couple years you could be rich like me!

See mostly all your favorite artists got some serious problems (yup)
Their money could be the problem but money can't solve 'em (nope)
Some get addicted to drugs and flat out lazy (woo)
Some taste a little fame and go flat out crazy (woo!)
I'm close cause those close wanna live off my fame (yup)
And that type of shit alone'll drive a nigga insane (crazy!)
Not to mention all the vultures, the scandalous promoters (okay)
Crabs'll try to sue you, magazines'll misquote ya
Most of these label heads, they don't care nothing about ya (nah)
If you stop selling records they'll act like they don't know ya
It's hard mixing business with pleasure so don't play
Me and my crew argue and fight like every other DAY (for real!)
Rappers ain't above the law but our life is so fast
That we got a special task force of police on our ass (true that)

I wish his ass well but I don't want nothing to do with him (woo!)
Some don't own they publishing me?  I never fool with 'em (nah)
I'm down for my artists, try my best to stay true to 'em (believe it)
Cause outside my label competition is irrelevant (DTP!)
Unless I'm still in competition with my president (what up Jay?)
And believe that I'm supporting the Hova

The time has come, for life to begin 
The time has come, for the war of the gods 

It's that time 
I'ma take the subtle approach first 
'Cause I'm just gettin' started 
Let's go 

Look, I'm the best and there's nothing that you can do about it 
Never needed a publicity stunt, let's tell the truth about it 
Even in the core of the streets, you can't sway the youth about it 
But keep runnin' yo mouth, and I swear I'ma knock a tooth up out it 
I never claimed to be nuthin' but who the fuck I am 
Never sold cocaine in my life, but I'm still the fuckin' man 
Understand, nuthin' you did makes you better nigga 
You claim the streets, but the streets respect that chedda nigga 
Luda got twice as much yo life you can charge it to 'em 
I fit four of your houses inside my daughters room 
And still have room for young Karma to play 
Givin' back to the children of tomorrow, for good karma today 
So you can say what ya wanna say, and you can talk that talk 
But real niggas ain't doing no talkin' cause we walk that walk 
Album for album you can see I got a multimillion plan 
So call yourself whatever you want 'cept the multimillion man 

How many times is you goin' rap about busting your gun 
How many times is you goin' trap without busting your gun 
Only shots you ever took were subliminal to the general 
Disrespectin' those doin' real time with real criminals 
And I ain't never did a day in my life 
But it should be illegal to walk a day in my life 
I paid the price and the cost to be the boss so you can rest your mouth 
I'm universal, Luda never limits himself to the south 
I give a damn about ya hootin' and hollerin', and it ain't botherin' me 
I hear you talkin' but you ain't made it to three 
You know where I live, but you ain't made it to me 
You ain't made nigga 
I'm havin' a house party, kid come get played nigga 
You got played, my record label never jerked me 
So shoot me, stab me, but words will never hurt me 
I feed off your energy, my powers with God 
So it's even better if you make ya diss record real hard

See even without the bass and all that treble I'm as hot as the devil
And I work for the top floor, homie get on my level
I've been stripped away of powers 'cause I gave you my blessin'
So it'll take more than majority vote to win this election
Man, mix tapes or not my resume is too hot
And I warned them that I was coming, I got the number one spot
So unless you using tampons, quit acting stuck up
And do like your records say, or shut the fuck up",War with God

And I'm like ""Yea but don't trip if I happen to yank a track out""
When I get done its smooth sailing once I pull that 'Lac out

Bravo, make make make it clap I'd break break break ya back
Then tuck tuck tuck you in so you can take take take a nap
Then back to making dividends I'm in the wind

How does it sounds when you making love on a Million dollars
I can only imagine lets make it real baby
Like D'Angelo ""How does it feel"" baby
I know I talk a lot shit but I can back it up (up up)
Like BBD flip it, rub it down, smack it up (up up)
You so bad when you call me for duty
You so fine I'm so sad that you feeling so woozy

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Don't get caught up in the gossip, them chicks is jockin' girl
They just jealous, everybody hates when Cris is rocking ya world
Hey girl, hey friend, how you doing, where you been
Enough of that talking, lets begin, break it in
Shake and spin, take it in, say amen
Then I'll make you say goodness gracious
Look me in the eye and make them nasty faces
I'm so glad that your body's so juicy
You so fine I'm so sad that you feeling so woozy

Welcome to Atlanta, GA

I hit heavy in the trunk so I say I'm heavy hittin'
My car just got a Jheri curl the paint's still drippin'
My whip so clean I turn lovers into haters
Then I make 'em come around like curl activator
There are none greater; I'm the freshest on the scene
Rap gaming Jones I'm the freshest on the team
But really I'm a coach spitting game to the players
And I'm yellow with that purp like I came with the Lakers
I'm out to get that paper, the mule and the acres
I'm repping for the rich, red, monkey bathing apers
So catch a contact like you inhaled Luda vapors
Cause rapers get smoked like I rolled in some paper
Put 'em in a ash tray throw away the roaches
Move them out my pathway show them who's the dopest
I bring home the bacon and protect it with the toasters
Like the lens on your camera, fuck, boy I'm so focused!

I'm in love with kush and Kate Fox
If ya need anything hit the safe deposit box

Came home with a duffel that was one point something

Mobster acknowledge I'm popping them dollars
Pop collars I touch hoes like crep flow

Got the streets on fire like raw scalps with a perm
I'm big worm and that big body slayer
Rip it open and you keep playing with my money
Smoke it like I'm a joke
I go for broke on the boulevard
In the paint and have a bitch nigga sliced from his eyes to his tank
You think I came at 225 pounds of trouble
Can't find a triller nigga than me if you had the Hubble
I been repping the dirty and I ain't finna to slow down
So if you ain't with it get out the way it's about to go down
You can get your issue like your ass subscribed
And when we ride there's nowhere that your ass can hide

Played pussy your bluff even if it's your period

And to top it off Brad left Jen for Angelina!
What the hell is going on in this World?!
This just can't be! If Will and Jada can do it, then why can't we?!
Hillary is still with Bill Clinton,
How did they do it? He got his dick sucked and the whole damn world knew it!
Now Paul McCartney losing half of his life,
All because he got divorced from his wife,
Somebody said ""it's cheaper to keep her"",
But not in K-Fed's case (nope!)

Nick and Jessica, Trina and Wayne

Even the Eagles broke up and got the Fuck back together,
Selling millions of copies And getting that cash

Or ride down Slawson,
Or to Casino,

Really doesn't matter,
Long as shots don't ring out,
Nigga I stay strapped,
I don't wanna pull the thing out,
Well keep the heat heat,

And grab somethin to eat,
But check ya rear view mirror,

Rollin in that dark blue,
SS Impala and,
All up on tha bumpa,
Man I'm just sayin,
Tell me you know this nigga,
Naw they betta stop playin,
He sped up around,
And drove right in front of us,
Could be one time,
Just tryin to bust one of us,
Till he smashed the brakes,
And we almost hit him,
Throwin signs out the window,
like something was wrong with him,
Before we jump out,
And get ready to clown,

Deep in your ocean I'ma find your buried treasure
So hop up on the dresser throw your legs up to the top (top)
Stretch it out like calisthenics, better that Luda wet it and get it
And have somebody call the medic (Medic!)
My head is in the right direction, my quarter's in your jukebox
Girl, you are my number one selection
I'll play you over and over, put your head on my shoulder
Slide down and give me head in the Rover (Rover)
And I'm a soldier, see it ain't no limits to the things we could do
And I made this record for you's, and a we can break it down
To the nitty gritty one time, and when it comes to the sexing
I get busy with mine, do you get busy with yours?
I guess we destined to see, baby girl you a destine to be

Playing the sweetest melody, is definitely heavenly by far (far)
Further than the moon, and I never fake it, but I take it
When you get naked cause your body's like boom (boom!)
How could I resist it, I'll be there in a instant
When you call, like tornadoes you got me twisted
I know you missed it, so I'ma give it good
You'll go ballistic, because I give it hood
Just like a nigga would, and like a nigga should
If you hear screaming then Luda's up in your neighborhood
Good gracious, yeah I do it right, and all night you are (back to hook)

It's courageous how you drop the phone and rush over
Crazy how you make me high when I'm sober
Just when I thought, I've seen it all, you put it down on me (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Addicted to the kisses your blow got me swole up
There's only one material, that's what you are to me

But you dont play netendo games
Load them up and fill them up to the top

See I was shitting shaving
Hit the coner for a block exchange
Amazing what my people would do
For some pocket change
But maybe this aint the life you choose
This is the life you stay strapped and pack a knife
Or end up with a bloody nose
Street survival or survival of the street
And only the strong survive
There's no survival for the weak
Catch a sneak eak at death if ur not on ur p's & q's
They carry banana clip and niggas will peel u for ur shoes
This is the blues but not all hill street
U can call it kill or be killed street
Lost a pint of blood let it spill street
Stop and wake uuuuuuuuuup

And it will take a fortune to get rid of all the pain

You say the only family u got is in the game

Downtown atlanta, big city, bright lights,
Mixin' henny wit the sprite,
While I'm drinkin' and drivin',
No police lights,
No police sirens,
I'm headed to the club, lokin' for a freak,
To spread a lil' love, to spread a couple cheeks,
Pull up to the spot, 26's like beam,
Eyes on me like ""bitch, do you see em'?
Stroll to the front dor headed to the vip,
Bought a couple bottles and I tok a couple sips,
Strokib' out the room and what do I see?,
A nice round butt and a pair of double d's,
So, I crept up like shawty what's happenin'?,
You killin' that dress and I love it with a passion,
Then she turned around and her face was aight,
She had a gap toth and a mean overbite,
But I was like hm!

If I take one more drink,
I'm gon' fuckin' you,
Is that what you wanna do shawty?,
If I take one more drink,
I'm gon' fuckin' you,
You too!

Woke up the next mornin' and all I can remember,
Was takin' shots and tippin' the bartender,
Surrender to the woman, end up bringing me home,
Cause' she started lokin' better, every shot of patron, (yep!)
I jumped up wit a devilish grin,
Cause' tonight, damn right! I might do it again!
So I called up the homies, (whaddup??) let's ride,
We can hit the sports bar, over on the southside,
Get a couple of coronas, couple of limes,
Went up to the bar, saw a couple of dimes,
So I, slowly walked up and said hi!
My name is Ludacris and I'ma hell of a guy,
One said I know who you are,

And right now, it's to bad, I got a man,
And I said I understand,
But where the hell is he at??
Cause' in a minute, if he dont show up, then man

(don't make me do it, don't make me do it!)
If I had one more drink

One more drink I'ma get cha,
Home, then I'll split cha,
Grab the camera phone,
And take a bunch drunk pictures,
Cause' hennessy mixed wit a whole bunch of buddha,
Equals you, mixed with a whole bunch of Luda,
And you know how far one drink could go,
Start slurrin' my speech, slowin' up da flow,
Hikin' up these skirts,
Climbin' up your shirt,

So guess what babygirl

From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your block,
Put the needle on a record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini,
And if she really gettin' low then I'm a shoot a video and put it all on T-V,

Our hot-line is lit the fuck up
With people with relationship issues
Caller number one, you're on the air

Yeah, man, y'all tell me if I'm crazy
Because this girl in here trippin'
You know what I'm sayin'
I'm a real man
I take care of my home
I take care of my kids
I pay all my bills
I mean, I ain't gonna lie
I may check a little female from time to time on the side
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
But what man don't?
So how can I break this down to her?

Ludacris, how do you feel about
This particular situation?
Get your money right, ladies
Learn to sign your own checks
But don't call me after midnight unless we havin' sex
Don't ever assume nothin', no
Man gon' be a man,
A groupie gon' be a groupie
A fan gon' be a fan
These tricks gon' keep on trickin'
Those hustlers gon' keep hustlin'
As long as there's new coochie
Dogs gon' keep fuckin'
So don't be all up in my phone
Replyin' to women's pages
I thought your mama taught you
You should never talk to strangers
Don't you ever ask no question
That you really don't want the answer to
So stop poppin' off at the mouth
Like Neno Brown I'll have to cancel you
Handle you, stop the ride, leave you on the avenue
Half of you always wantin' some nigga to pampa you
And that'll do for him, but not for me
I'll probably baffle you
And if he wants to act a fool
I'll show 'em what the gat will do
Run along, go find somebody to snitch on or go chit-chatter to
Then your name will follow a
What ever happened to

Exactly, that's just what she need to hear
Damn right, player, a'ight, thank you
For callin', next caller

Yeah, I hear you
But let's talk about the fake-ass brothers
With the twenty four's, but cannot pay the note on they lease
And my nigga with his high style chains
And I can't get him to pay his damn child support
That's why we makin' mo' money and ownin' our own property
And right just as nice, so now
I guess if we want to, we can bare ya too now

Interestin', Shauna, you wanna
Stick on this one?

Get your money right niggas
Get a bitch that can keep up with you
I'm tired of thinking to myself
Why in the hell did I ever fuck wit' you
Don't step wit' you
Sick of your childish games and all the stuff you do
I probably mentioned your name
But, true to the game, I've had enough of you
I've seen your type before
Doin' the fours all over the floor
He's flashin' his chain's, he's flashin' his dough
He drinkin' the fifths, then drinkin' them all
But what you don't know, this nigga fraud
He can't even afford to smoke
Back in the hood all the hustlers and G's know he's a joke
That's why I treat a nigga
Just when he eat it I tell him 'beat it, nigga
Real bitches, true to the game
That's how you G, nigga
D-T-P stayin' the zone like we own P-C-P
Chrome on the S-S Shawn, I blow the P-C-P
Y'all niggas ain't on my level, I do it so hood
Pineapple and berry weed, we feeling so good
Lightning is Sup-doo, I get my own stack
That's why I leave them two hundred
I never call back
That's right Shauna pussy rule the world

Yes, it does, next caller
What's up?

Man, what's up? 
This is Marv
I wanna know the y'all that somebody talk to
This triflin'-ass woman like me
I'm a good man
But all these good men get treated like shit
Our friends callin' at 3:30 in the morning
Marcus don't wanna talk about no numbers
Marcus wanna talk about that ass
And I ain't havin' it
Ya got someone to talk to
These women, because they need to be told
I twenty you better
Talk to 'em

Get your money right, ladies
Tell the man to get gone
But don't you show up to my crib with your period on
This is lesson one, baby
Listen, how should I begin?
Ain't no such thing as a platonic friend
You're lying to yourself if you don't think you want more
So don't you call me insecure when he show up at your door
You all claim to have substance, self-respect, and some class
But half-naked in the club, and steady shaking your ass
Screamin' I ain't done enough to touch you under your skirt
But who the hell are you to tell me what my money is worth?
I'm on the streets and you trippin' I don't make you feel safe
I stay at home and you complaining that you think we need space
I'm that sayin' that it's fair, but that's the way that it is
Ain't no nigga tryin' to marry you with four or five kids
It may sound a little harsh, but it's straight from the heart
A nigga didn't write the scripts, so I'm just doin' my part
Yeah

Preach, my brother, preach
All you women out there heard that
And you better believe they did
And some millions of people listening
That's our show for this year

I made my mind up thinkin' I'm on the right track
So then I leave you, but then come right back
And I don't like that, I swear I'm so confused
Don't know what I want or what's the right thing to do

Pack your clothes like you really 'bout to leave this time
Know you messed up but actin like it's me this time
It's a revolvin' door, that keeps spinnin' 'round
Are we gon' be together, or are we finished now?

Then he made his tongue above his nose, I said ""You know you wrong""
But I'm really like sho' you right, tell me where you wanna go tonight
Anywhere, any place, I can see it in your face you are the prototype
To the ceiling I'm so so high, so-so feelin like I'm so so right
Please tell me why the 'dro so fire, I can't stop zonin and I don't know why
Ay look - beep beep get up out my lane, y'all hoes can't do it like me
If you're thinkin I'm 'bout the game, take a look at my U-N-I-T
That's right I'm back on deck, but don't get it twisted the strap on deck
The mac on deck, the pack on deck, and e'ry damn day keep a rack on deck
And that's on Jeff, that's on we, that's on Hoover and that's on me
That's that wood that match them seats, and that's in the Caddy and that's on 3's
No matter what they said I been gettin my bread, get my paper, get my check

He don't know how to act
And I don't know how to stop, and I don't know how to quit

'Cause I'm dat bitch that still keep a mean fetish
Still stack lettuce, still stack cheese

I dun had about four five six shots
Yeah I'm getting wasted
Red pills, blue pills yeah I'm in the Matrix
Two swisha, three swisha, four swisha, five
So turn my music up and tell these hoes to get live
Got a pocket full of hundreds and some bottles on ice, ice
Conjure and lime got a nigga feeling nice, nice
Dessert on my hip so if you gamble roll the dice
When I let it off once, make a nigga think twice, twice
You got more dough then homie you gon have to show me
You never say it rains like Tony Toni Tone
My Chevy's outside and it's sitting on Kobe's
And I keep the hood with me like Obi Wan Kenobe
Wood grain trim, seats softer than your butt butt
Make the car rattle from the speakers in my trunk, trunk
Swishas burning slow and it got a nigga stuck, stuck
But don't be a fool cause the tool's on tuck tuck

Tell that slow bitch to bring another round
We gon' party til the suns up
Ladies rub your titties and gangsta's put your guns up
Money, money, money if you got it throw your ones up
And if they ain't got it tell 'em shut up you dumb fuck
My money stays in hand you could say I got a grip, grip
Out to scoop my chips you could say I got a dip, dip
Cause I talk money while these haters talk shit, shit
And if they keep on talking I'ma empty out a clip, clip
But I don't want no problems I'm just trying to get my game on
Take a couple shots and use the alcohol to blame on
Holla at some chicks then find a bitch to put my name on
Then I'ma be I'ma be the one she put that thang on
I got the perfect song to make you want me want to shake, shake
Take her to the crib I don't take her on no date, date
We all up in the club til the glass and table break, break
And all they wanna know is how much more that I can take, take

[Chorus]

Now keep the camera's flashin' we about to shoot a movie
A thick chick let me sip my glass on her booty
She stuck upon my hip and she swear she ain't no groupie
While I'm stuck up on the VIP, but everything is all Gucci
So I gathered all the women and we about to take a shot, shot
Gone out my mind, who's there nigga knock knock,
Don't you hear that 808 beatin' down your block, block
Keep the party going cause the party don't stop, stop

Ludacris,"So I'm just sitting in this rehab class
Trying to get myself unhooked on ass
So then my teacher asked me a question
Like Ludacris are you over there sexting
Ha ha O-M-G l-o-l K-I-T Smiley faces X and O's L-M-F-A-O
My girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone
I said my girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone

So I'm getting treated for my sex addiction
In a private clinic and I need you to be sensitive about my condition
Cause I'm in it to win it and I really don't want to
Further disappoint my fans
And my teachers a cougar so I wish she'd lend a helping hand, a helping hand
Damn, calm down, B-B-C T-X-T or M-S-G
After class come with me and can I get a little bit of T-L-C
She replied what the fuck
F-Y-I you're gonna flunk
S-M-H it's such a shame
You ain't learned a damn thing

So I'm just sitting in this rehab class
Trying to get myself unhooked on ass
So then my teacher asked me a question

I said my girl went through my cell phone

So I'm sitting in the crib just chillin' and I'm minding my business
Got a text with a tongue out from a number I didn't recognize
I replied who is this
Quick back got a hit back
Said this is Stacy and I've been missing you
Had to change my number so I went and got a new phone and new tattoo
A what, a new tattoo wow,
Awh yeah, hurry click
Can you send a nasty pic
So I can see right where it is
And I promise I won't show my friends (yeah right)
She replied, well OK B-T-W by the way
S-M-H it's such a shame that you ain't learned a damn thing

So I'm just sitting in this rehab class
Trying to get myself unhooked on ass
So then my teacher asked me a question

My girl went through my cell phone
I said my girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone

So I pull up to the club stunting in a yellow Lamborghini
Half bent, black tint, fine pussy make it a little hard to see me
Stepped out, fresh out headed straight for the door and to the VIP
Next thing I got a text from a freaky Latina saying is that you I see
Is that you papi
So I B-B-M'ed abbreviate yep and before the night gets too late
Let me hit you with a little Q and A
Can I tap that ass t-t-a
She replied it all depends
It's me plus one can I bring my friends
And all I can think was that it's such a shame
That I ain't learned a damn thing

So I'm just sitting in this rehab class
Trying to get myself unhooked on ass
So then my teacher asked me a question

Knowin' that you got someone to talk to ain't that what you want? 
I'll be your lover, your provider, and your confidant. 
And I won't judge you cause I know that ain't nobody perfect,
But you got some perfect imperfections that makes you worth it. 
I wanna see yo body in all the positions that you like it in,

You like it rough I give it rough and I start to pull your hair,
Cause ecstasy's your destination and I'ma take you there,
Tell me a secret baby

Tell me somethin' that nobody else knows, 
And think about it just as soon as the door close.

Imagine all the possibilities and the freaky things that we could do. 
Blind folded,
Handcuffed to the head board never let you go until you scream my name, 
Maybe you think I'm playin' but this is really far from a mothafuckin' game. 
Ain't a damn thang changed still nasty as I wanna be. 
And I got just what you want baby girl you want it,
See it'll turn you on and it's gonna be on as soon as I take it off. 
Just give me your body its guaranteed that I'ma
Break you off, off, off, off, off until the sun rise,
And I'm not here to disappoint just give me one try. 
One kiss one pinch and you could take it or leave it,
But before you make up your mind just tell me one secret,
Ne-Yo holla at 'em.

And think about it just as soon as the door close.

Cause I'm dat bitch that still keep a mean fetish
Still stack lettuce, still stack cheese

Some will die over oil
Kill over land
Charge you for taxes
And blame Uncle Sam
Read you your rights
And charge you for nothing
Now who's really gangsta and tell me who's frontin'
Murder your sons, ravage your daughters
Here overseas and across the waters
Tanks and missiles
Bombs and grenades
Inject your land with guns and AIDS
You betta' pray to the most high or who ever you praise
'Cause politicians can't help you they puppets to slaves
Trying to get paid and you are too
Whatcha gone do when the gun is pointed at you (like bank robbers)

Turn on the news
Ride through the hood
I witness the blues
How can you ignore it
It's easy to spot it
A trap house, a liquor store and your city's got it
And my city's got it, and their city's got it
This world is chaotic
And love is symbolic
So life don't get cherished,
So our babies perish, and your babies perish
Now tell me who's careless
Now who should I pray to
What should I pray for
You can't pay the preacher for your redemption
I know where we're headed
I already read it
The good book done said it (like cowboys and Indians)

They say tomorrow's not promised today
But today I promise if we don't make our own way
Somebody'll take it from us
Snatch it like rats to cheese
So, lord help me please
Cause I rather die on my feet than to live on my knees
Living like I'm bulletproof cocking the glock and aim n shoot
My future's ever clear 180 proof
So I open the bottle then swallow my pride and drink the pain away
I take shots and just lay up then fade away
Dreaming of betta' days
Dreaming of betta' pay,
But we got our work cut out for us so we betta' pray
Pray to uphold the weak, not for eternal sleep,
But if I die I pray the lord my soul to keep

Sip slow but I'm drivin' all in the fast lane

Ludacris,"When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

I done took all I could take from you
Need a little bit more than a break from you
Matter of fact fuck you, don't need you in my life
You done did so much wrong I hope you get it right
But not at my expense, I did all I could do
You just took me for granted, you thought I was a fool
When I did everything in my power to help and please you
But I don't know you no more, fuck it, I caught amnesia
Too many emotions I try to bury
But the higher I climb, the less weight I'm trying to carry
And niggas holdin' on for dear life, bringin' me drama
But I'm only responsible for my daughters Cai and Karma
Nigga you's a grown man, get yourself together
Forget about the past, now's a better time than never
Matter of fact, it's time to start making better decisions
So put your fires out, and stop burning 'Cris' bridges
You little bitches

When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

Yeah, this industry's full of bullshitters
And all this time you thought you had me fooled niggas
In my Ferrari, partner thought he saw a spaceship
'Cause I move in speed not to get caught up in this fake shit
Smiling in my face when I'm around y'all
But soon as I leave, niggas be prayin' on my down fall
Is it cause you'll never sell as many records?
My bitches always look better, you fail at business endeavors?
Or that people thought you were clever, but now they know you stupid?
And misery loves company now that you're going through it?
Somebody tell these rappers I worked hard in these Louis
So get out of here, you don't want no parts in this shit, do we?
I see them drugs got y'all trippin' too soon
That's why you find me in the club, every once in a blue moon
So while you contemplate making your first million
I'll be somewhere contemplating on making my first billion
And then, trillion

When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

The biggest mistake we make as individuals
Is thinking everyone lives by the same principles
But when I talk by the same teachers or principals
For you to know it's not the money, it's the principle
So I can't expect you to know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Our issues are deep within, we can't just talk 'em out
Niggas is fighting inside, we can't just walk 'em out
These bridges burning so fast, we can't just stomp 'em out
As if you know what I'm talkin' 'bout

When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go",Burning Bridges
Ludacris,"I keep dwellin' on the past, babe
Know what I need, yeah

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had h*** and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence, some befriended me
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
Believe in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking 'bout ""that's supposed to be you, girl""

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
Need solutions, less problems
'Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em
Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me",Good Lovin
Ludacris,"Yeah, I used to care so much what people thought about me
Now I really could give a fuck
Now when I own over 15 million in real estate
And bought all The Fast & Furious trucks
See, everyday I put in work and my salary grows
So excuse me I'm not caught up on reality shows
See the reasons family values on the south side
I live in Atlanta but do not have an Atlanta's house, why?

I'm not married, I've never been engaged
But your dumbass believes whatever's on the front page
See some of these bloggers don't even believe their own lies
Turn the computer screen into a mirror, look at your own lives
'Cause technology exceeds all humanity
But there's a thin line between genius and insanity
Now private pics on my private, no longer private, man
Hope I can gets some privacy up on my private plane

Oh, living in the spotlight
Oh if it's too hot, too hot tonight
I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
Let me live 'til I die

I'm doing interviews
Getting asked the same questions from 10 years ago
Wondering to myself what the fuck I'm there for
(What am I here for?)
Now that my daughter's a CEO at the age of 10
And I got restaurants inside Atlanta's airport
That repetition will drive any human being nutty
I'd rather be in my own crib, on my own couch
Thinking I got that ""do what the fuck I wanna do money""
Yeah, and then I went to Quincy Jones' house
Realize I didn't have shit, got some work to do
Soon as you get some money
Is gon' be someone with more than you
Sci-fi movies, the fans said this album is overdue
And if you don't put some music out
These niggas gon' be over you
Talking about where that old Luda, for the rapper's sake
But Usher told me if I don't evolve I'll evaporate
I've gotten better, motherfucker if you listen
If you're smart, and went to college better use your intuition

Oh, living in the spotlight
Oh, if it's too hot, too hot tonight
I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
Let me live 'til I die

Yeah, my own expectations I exceeded them
And when people say Luda's underrated, I'd agree with 'em
They said I'm so visual they overlook the lyrics
But every verse you get a sample if your mind can clear it
Then steer it in the direction of your memory
And I'll be satisfied when I'm celebrated for centuries
Wrote a song for my girl she couldn't stand straight
My man said, ""don't release it, you'll ruin your female fan base""
I said, ""man, my female fan base gon' be here forever""
'Cause even though I'm with one, to them we're still together
And who am I to tell 'em different if my voice can freak 'em
Long as I can continue coming through all of that speakers
I'm a man of choice words but I speak the truth
And I ain't scared of shit except God and a life jail suit
Especially when all of my bills are paid for
And God answer everything that I pray for

Oh, living in the spotlight
Oh, if it's too hot, too hot tonight
I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'ma be alright, I'ma be alright
Let me live 'til I die

Oh, living in the spotlight
Oh, if it's too hot, too hot tonight

Ludacris,"Yeah, I'm ready to do it all over
My heart colder, hip-hop I'm part owner
Southern rap specialist, verses intelligent
Elegant, it's Ludacris, don't ever question my relevance
No pun intended, if no one's offended, get offended
Don't get it twisted, guns can get extended
Ready to die for my respect, my value, my worth
Unequivocal, lyrical beast on every fuckin' verse

I throw the curse just to stretch the emotions
Somebody said I'm washed up, I told 'em pass me the lotion
'Cause the industry's dryin' up and these verses are moisturizer
Then hand me your favorite rapper and Luda will posterize him
I'm dunkin' over you critics, dozin' off when I'm spittin'
My fans locked behind these bars, I put my life in a sentence
Good riddance, I wake 'em up if they step to the plate
'Cause sleep's the cousin of death and I could never relate
Luda!

See the only people I owe my loyalty to are the ones who made me question it.
Loyalty goes both ways but never push a loyal person
To the point when they no longer give a fuck.
There comes a time in life where you walk away
From all the drama and the people who create that shit.
Destroy what destroys you!
You'll never see all the great things ahead
If you keep looking at all the bad things behind you.
They say the hardest things in life is know
Which bridge to cross and which ones to burn.
So may the bridges I burn light yo motherfuckin' way!
(So what's the number one cause of all these problems?)",New Beginning Intro
Ludacris,"They say ""Luda, would you rather have the money or the fame?""
And I steady try to tell 'em that it all just depends
'Cause every time I make a little more money I seem to be losin' more of my friends
So I'd give it all up to repeat life over and they'd say ""Dude is a fool""
I can't trust another motherfucker livin' in this world and this really got me losin' my cool
What would you'd do if you were in my situation
And the minute everyone you ever loved to say you looked up?
You drink your pain to the bottom of a bottle and the Conjure would have you fucked up
So I'm lookin' for love in all the wrong places, pop pills, drink liquor by the cases
Get high, make a woman get low, in the strip club lookin' for familiar faces
People know me on a first name basis but all they ever really want's my cash
""Let me borrow just a couple hundred dollars and you know that I'm a pay you back"", my ass
This world so superficial, this world done lost my trust
They say ""Ludacris, you changin'"" but I really don't give a fuck!
What the hell am I suppose to think? What the hell am I suppose to do?
I'm hearin' that the Devil's in disguise and I'm hearin' that the nigga look just like you
They know I walk throw the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I don't go astray
And I get down on my knees and pray and I say

(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away
Wish my problems would go away, away, away

Doc say I need to change my diet, cause I'm really not eatin' right
Mama said I need some peace and quite, cause I'm really not sleepin' right
What's the use of havin' all the money and the power in the world if I can't abuse it?
Seems like the, only thing that's, keepin' me together is my music
If it wasn't for that I think I would lose it; if it wasn't for that I would go crazy
When nobody make good on they word and the industry'd make you feel like fuck you pay me
'Cause I gotta feed family, some of the same ones that abandoned me
That still lookin' for a hand out, 'til you found out that there ain't shit ya handed me
Hah, still mad at me? But I'm tryin' to be the man I plan to be
But can't do it if you callin' me for dumb shit, thinkin' it's innocent, I'm a plea insanity (ohh!)
Too many distractions, and it feels like everyday
So I get down on my knees and pray and I say

(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away
Wish my problems would go away, away, away

I finally made it to the top of the CEO position
But when things don't go their way, these artists got all these suspicions
So the weed keep me at peace and I think I need an intervention
Who the fuck put me in charge of makin' all of these decisions?
My position got me stressin' like it never did before
Not to mention my best friend drowned and death was knockin' at his door
And it seems like someone in my family is passin' away like everyday
So I just look up to the sky and get on my knees and pray and I say!

Flow tighter than four fat bitches sittin' in a Civic
My flows are unimaginable, Hannibal Lecter shit
Eatin' emcees for breakfast, bitch
Since I was born to touch the mic
The first time it's been a problem
Your life was a mistake
Your pops should've wore a condom
You niggas think you hard
I think you better come harder (Go hard)
I leave rappers confused like will.i.am barber
Ah, fuckin' with Luda's not a great look
A verse'll make your fans unfriend you on Facebook
Click, my styles are goin' into labor
So if stars won a war, I made daddy like Darth Vader
And since I'm always high, it's kind of hard to overlook me
For over a hundred stacks, it's kind of hard to overbook me
And a whole 'nother house for my cars is on my checklist
Cause to fit 'em in one garage is like a nigga playin' Tetris
But they say patience is a virtue
Cause I got your bitch stayin' out way past her curfew
Guess I was a thief that got away with these words
Slangin' chickens out my whip like I been playin' Angry Birds
In a black Rolls Royce, Dark Knight like Batman
Everywhere you turn, the Ghost follows like Pac-Man
And I sleep with the John Dillinger
And always keep an eye half-open like Forest Whitaker
No, you boys ain't ready for combat
Be more worried if I renew my Def Jam contract
What path is he on? Opponents, I laugh and be gone
They handin' in the towels like they work in Bed, Bath & Beyond
But in the midst of all the melee
Y'all niggas just bitches with dicks like Sheneneh
Your rap styles are phony, your lines are just dead
And I be on them lines like a nigga just played
Guess I'm tryin' to say I'm advanced, you intermediate
You wouldn't know the real me if your bitch Wikipedia'd it
Just know that I never tried to be hard
Probably cause Mr. Glock 40's my security guard
You'll get chopped like judo
Gangs in my hood make you reverse
And change your color like the block's playin' Uno
And, yes, some of my friends is still sellin' them drugs
But I just say they Weight Watchers like Jennifer Hud
They show me love
That's why I'll always stay reppin' until the death of me
Rappers talk shit, but ain't nobody ever stepped to me
I hereby command all my fans' to inject it
Overdose on Red Bull in your veins if you ever slept on me
Yeah, my mind is sharper than a guillotine
All the knives extended from the knuckles of Wolverine
Not a X-Man, but, man, I got that X
I'm on my hardest, switch labels, but I still get a cheque
The more albums they sell, the more we all win
And I can be seen in thirty rocks like Alec Baldwin
Or watchin' CBS in a Cadillac DTS
I plan to reach the world, man, your plan is MetroPCS
I changed my music up cause I was gettin' bored
You may not like the way I shoot, but my points go on the board
My name still engrained and these books will be the outcome
And this one verse is harder than a lot of niggas' albums

Hungover and missing flights and cutting our show money

And put us in a position to make some real life decisions (hmmm)

Hanging out the window front and central like a late-night Wendy's drive through

I could skydive off of the top of the roof, rims taller than King Kong
Riding around looking for an ass that I could sit my drink on

Rolling through my hood, I told 'em pimpin' ain't that easy

With my wrist glowing and my fist throwing
And my Lamborghini Aventador sneak it on the block
Been going and I been flowing I gotta say that Ludacris, a nigga never gonna stop
Hanging with women that's loving them drugs
Neighborhood call me the plug of the plug
Poppin' a pill and then jump in the tub
We buy out the bar, we buy out the club
Got a black, AMX, I left home, no Visa
Talk money, and my money, talk back, like Caesar

You sipping man, quit tripping man, stop acting like a ho
Waitress said another round? I said you already know

You see I started from nothing and made it up outta the hood
Dollar and a dream and I made what I could
Fifty to a hundred, then a hundred to a grand
Then a grand to a milli, nigga really what's good
It's wood in the whip the wood like a wood shop
Neighbor's all think that I cook rocks
No peace in the streets
Really got me thinking ain't no such thing as a good cop
My neck froze and no ice steel
Flows, rappers just bite still
Platinum plaques, three Grammy's
I tell you I Made It like Mike Will
With coupes all on that freeway
Pockets on Gabby Sidibe
Got cake and women blowing like everyday is my b-day

We be getting mighty bold (When the liquor get up in her)

With her legs sprawled out like the Air Jordan symbol
She be twenty thousand feet in my apartment in the sky
Y'all hoes just drink and drive, my woman just drink and fly
She a lady in the street ain't nothing fake about her booty
She call me for special ops, I told her that's my Call of Duty

Ludacris,"Did some movies and started missing this rap shit
Back to rap then starting missing them movies
Left these hoes to settle down with just one chick
Get with one chick started missing them groupies
Stop drinking for a year and I was all sober
Next year I got drunk and did it all over
Yesterday I quit smoking and swore I had enough
Till I smelt it in the club and had to take a puff
I got rich and learned life was a bitch
Now everybody's after all of my ends
(Get yo hand out my pocket!)
When I was broke all love from my folks
But nowadays I'm losing all of my friends, let the story begin

The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly

The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high

Bye bye butterfly

Start exercising and winning got me a six pack
Was eating healthy and did away with the junk
Then I got lazy and started to wanna kick back
My six pack reverted back to a gut
When I'm at the crib I'm mad I'm not at the club lit
When I'm at the club I'm mad I'm not at the crib
I used to be out partying every damn night
Now sometimes I'd rather be with my kids
I got checks gained a lot of respect now everywhere I go they holla my name (Luda!)
But sometimes wish that I was disguised for peace of mind over fortune and fame
Guess what I'm really saying

The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly

The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side

Last year got the Ferrari that I always wanted
Drove it crazy got sick of it had to trade (Give me my Ac'!)
All my fans convinced me to grow my hair back
Grew it back then started missing my fade
I got hits start trippin' I wasn't underground
Got underground start trippin' I need hits (We outta here!)
When you down and people give you the runaround
But feels great to know who really gives a shit
You cut the grass and the snakes will show
And know your neighbor's fertilizer is fake (Don't let it fool ya!)
We always searching what we never had
Always ignoring what's in front of our face
We've been conditioned to think

The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side

I'm just going to get right to it
Luda!

Ain't nobody fuckin' with me when it come to getting lyrical
Murdering the rapper and killing beats nigga!
I'm cinematic making everybody panic
I be bustin' like a fully automatic feel the heat nigga!
We can battle in the Phantom in Atlanta the rover
in Minnesota or the Arizona streets nigga
They sayin' all these offensive lines I snapback it's the quarterback sneak nigga!
One time for the sneak dissers Ol' puss ass fuckboys say my name!
Anybody coming at me know I never back down killing a rapper is my claim to fame!
You lame
And my flow is what expose in these hoes even on a nigga worst day
They say Luda don't want it no mo'
No nigga I'm as hungry as the first day
What you want how you want it you can get
I'm the definition of a real g from the south side
The crime scene be the studio get the yellow tape
and the chalk and I'm leaving everybody outline
I'm all about mine
Getting paid getting laid getting clothes getting hoes getting green back
Used be like everybody is a lil kid now Big Boy, outcast like three stacks
Laying all it in the Cadillac with a red bone
giving me dome my music on with the seats back
Ludacris this is album number 8 and my pockets gonna be straight
Even if a nigga leak that
Timmy all up on the David Banner track with Janet Jack
in the back like ""Damn Luda freak that!""
Break it down like you dropping to the ground
but we like the 808 in Atlanta so bring the beat back
Sample had to eat that
Couldn't control all of the leader
But put any other rapper on the track and
I guarantee they'll never know how to treat that
I'm a boss I'm a king I'm a legend Imma drill it in your head till you dose off
And I just so happen to be the type of rapper
that make your women want to take her clothes off
So let's get to the action
Let's get to the show
I'm been getting to the Forbes list six year straight let's get to the do'
Shout out to the Luda Nation
All my fans just got live
And they waitin' for everybody to put me in the rapper category of ya top five

Let me get it back

Ever since I
Came in the game it ain't never been the same
Can't nobody do it like me
Is it ever gonna be another Luda you know that'll never happen that's highly unlikely
Knowing that I'm better than everybody you put me up against I'm in the hall of fame
So fuck call to call we can go bar for bar
I'll put your name up on the wall of shame
And everyday is the same thing
Looking for another way for me to make paper
I think it's time for every single rapper to go to church
Whoever is my opponent you better pray first
They like ""Luda why you rapping so fast?""
I'm like ""Bitch why you listen too slow?""
I'm the truth in the booth and they can't keep up
hardly cause I always hit em with a new flow
And the two door with the coup low with the Hublot
off the window with the two low
Blades from the top like judo listening to Bruno on the way to school though
Getting kudos from a few hoes and they from the choose though
Cuz I'm numero uno and the crew know it's a couple loop holes
When it come to fluke hoes cuz some of they pussy bite like Kujo
But back to the you know who
I can't stop till you tell me I'm the greatest
If you need a reminder then put the whole song on repeat and continue to play this
Better turn your stereo louder
Listen up and let me preach
And let's get arrested for disturbing the peace",Ludaversal (Intro)
Ludacris,"Ey man, if you got a problem with somebody
Whatever happened to approaching them?
Looking at em eye to eye
Too much tweefin' going on in this world
Thumb thuggin' is at an all-time high
They startin' to take this shit a lil too far Jack
Rappers all in they feelings
Well here goes a little lyrical healing

And hip hop is, uh
Too many rappers gettin' sensitive
Ya'll should start a pussy ass nigga initiative
Cuz even when I'm not mic'd up
I'll fuck your life up
Come to your show when ya crowdsurfin' and hold a knife up
I tell your momma you ain't shit
I hope you skydive and all land in an alligator pit
Your album ain't shit, you couldn't sell it at an auction
Your five minutes is up, like Antoine Dodson
Meanwhile that Mary Jane got me wiser
And Mr. Jack Daniels is my spiritual advisor
Now everybody said I'm strapped and I'm too scary
And keep a hand under the pillow like the tooth fairy
Your favorite rapper say I'm sick and they ain't no antidote
They kidnapping my flows they ain't even leave a ransom note
Your shit is faker than the knockoff man
I'll make you niggas quit rappin' start a hot dog stand",Lyrical Healing
Ludacris,"If we look to the stars, you'll find that you're not far from them
And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them
And not long, and not long, and not long, and not long, and not long

Long days half sober nights
Unsigned, performing at every open mic
God is all I needed to believe in me
Haters I tuned them out they were on another frequency
My momma never winded my decision
And all the bright lights never blinded out my vision
Music was my passion and my first crush
I'm just tryna ride the waves baby surfs up
When I'm down music gets me worked up
Plus at all my shows, gets women to pull they shirts up
What can I say I'm turnt up
I'm on fire these other rappers is burnt up

If we look to the stars, you'll find that you're not far from them
And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them
And not long, and not long, and not long, and not long, and not long

Yeah what an imagination
I'm a dreamer losing my concentration
Head in the clouds to trace my observations
Just connect the dots to all of the constellations
Looking for signs that's astrological
And I don't dream big, my dreams are astronomical
So when critics write articles of my chronicles
I wonder if my hunger is felt in they abdominal
Hiding from life's daily distraction
Where thoughts become things from the power of attraction
And I'm attracted to money and beautiful women
Ha and toasting to new beginnings, yeah

If we look to the stars, you'll find that you're not far from them
And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them
And not long, and not long, and not long, and not long, and not long

Look it's not long 'til the fights over
But turbulence is non stop till the flights over
So when passengers panic just stay silent
And realize its never too late to become the pilot
I fly higher take control of my destiny
The first step I needed me to invest in me
It's still a every day struggle for wealth
But rather struggle working for me than working for someone else
And I'm steady tryna ease the stress
So I open up all the doors with the key to success
If it hasn't been done then I'mma do it first
'Cause I'm the master of the Ludaverse

If we look to the stars, you'll find that you're not far from them
And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them
And not long, and not long, and not long, and not long, and not lon",Not Long

You're still living through me
Listen!

Look, I lost my father to the bottle
I'd hug him everyday like I might not see him tomorrow
Got enough sorrow for a lifetime
'Cause when he was living I'm thinking how do I get him to listen
When he was seldom in his right mind
My early years I was too young to understand
But I remember the smell of beer and seeing all them empty cans
Waking up, crying in the night, hearing arguments
Hands off my momma, somehow knew he was the cause of it
Got a little older and he got a little worse
Drinking must be his remedy, he got a little cursed
Well, tell me what's the cure for a man who miss his pops
The beat goes on, but the drinking's gotta stop!

If I had have known I wouldn't see you tomorrow
I would've grabbed a hold of your heart, and put your love in a bottle, hey
But now you got me drunk off that pain, gone off that sorrow
Wishing every day you were here with me
But now that you're gone, I lost my heart to the bottle, to the bottle

Yeah, I lost my father to the bottle
Functioning alcoholic's what they call it far as I know
Became a teenager and started to understand
But even through drinks he still taught me to be a man
So before the hospital, where the paramedics rushed him
Any and everybody who met him, instantly loved him
Ironic how conjure would have made him even sicker
'Cause who gon' tell him he can't drink none of his son's liquor
And tell me without my father how am I supposed to manage?
He had the biggest heart, but also had that liver damage
Tell me what's the cure for a man who miss his paps
The beat goes on, but the drinking' gotta stop!

If I had have known I wouldn't see you tomorrow
I would've grabbed a hold of your heart, and put your love in a bottle, hey
But now you got me drunk off that pain, gone off that sorrow
Wishing every day you were here with me
But now that you're gone, I lost my heart to the bottle, to the bottle

Not a day goes by that I don't miss you, and don't wish you were here with me
No matter what you did, I forgive you!

I lost my father to the bottle
Tell your parents you love 'em
You might not see 'em tomorrow!
I swallow my pride, try to put my problems aside
But I feel so hollow inside
Gotta keep my eyes on the prize
'Cause I'm steady wishing you were here
To see the goals that I plan to reach
You left the day after I put you in my Grammy speech
It's almost like you waited just to see me win
Well, pops I can't wait until the day we meet!

If I had have known I wouldn't see you tomorrow
I would've grabbed a hold of your heart, and put your love in a bottle, hey
But now you got me drunk off that pain, gone off that sorrow
Wishing every day you were here with me
But now that you're gone, I lost my heart to the bottle, to the bottle

Can't get over you you you, hey
Love in a bottle, hey hey
Oh, we miss you!

I wanna see you again
(I wanna see you tomorrow)
I wanna see you tomorrow

Welcome to my world Ludaversal!

Listen
I think I got the best job in the world
'Cause I ain't gotta take the piss test
Michael sending me Jordans every 1st of the month
Said his kids love me, ain't paid for a pair of kicks since
Why is it that when 'em niggas gettin' rich
The whole world just wanna get you some free shit? (Hahah)
Ain't that 'bout a bitch
Especially when they told me I'll never do shit, or be shit
I made it and never took you for granted
Took off and I never landed, supply whatever demanded and no one's ever handed it to me
I kicked it off with me and my special team and shot the [?] to me
Touchdown on my old turf, money and bitches sucking me in my microphone vest
And know I'm not surprised that my old [?] taking niggas to school, go do your homework

Almost everyday I'm waking up in another city
Another country, a different climate and a time zone
Jet lag but I'm out of the bed fast for bad foreign bitches that I'm eager to lay my eyes on
So I opened up the blinds to the sky on
Wish that I could talk to God on my iPhone
I thank Him for all of his generosity
And for satisfying most of my curiosity
Fans asking me what it's like to be me
I always tell 'em it's more good than bad
They say I want what you got
I tell 'em you'll never have shit if you don't appreciate what you have
So I have learned to appreciate all the simple things
Like some good head and a fine wine
We all going through life searching for answers
And I been all around the world trynna find mine

Seems like everyday is a holiday
Celebratory popping bottles and model days
Stereotypical rap shit personified
From 8 albums committin' lyrical homicide
These airports like international mazes
Now my passport needs additional pages
Then I'm staring out at another horizon
Staying fly even in the no fly zone
Bodies on board but my mind's gone
Ain't no better feeling than when I fly home
Staring out the window of the plane in the rains even the clouds need a shoulder to cry on
I'm crying cuz I'm living out my dreams
But this life is not easy as it seems
It's sorta similar to a crack game
Ain't no slowing down when you living in the fast lane

Yeah, and I been going around in circles

And we have a responsibility to live it
From the first breath to the last
Our future is built on the foundation of our past
Experience is a professor, and its test's at a highest pressure
While we can't afford to crack
We must bear not to break
Like a reed in the wind we go with the flow
While still reaching for the light
Avoid useless conflict while never running from the fight
The struggle that forever brought me to just beneath the surface
I'm dedicating to the service of self and to my people
And to never feeding the beast of unnecessary evil
We say the motion of [?]
Take the action to display our character
From the first second that we start to feast until the day that we break this barrier
So disparaging is a civilized savage only strive to become average
I'm not happier as a maverick
A cowboy that uses his cabbage to get more green than most millions done seen
The good kind and never the bad bitch
The best that life has to give are the blessings of this life that we live
And everyday I'm [?] not lose my way I've had to learn

E querer desistir?

Que terrível arma é

Ludmilla,"Mais uma vez você mudou
E a gente não se fala mais
Da outra vez você jurou
Que o que passou ficou pra trás

Eu avisei que era melhor
Esquecer e só viver em paz
Cadê você que deu um nó?
Cria os sonhos e depois desfaz

Mas te confesso que um beijo
Já me desperta um desejo
Do que a gente faz
Mas se for pra ser desse jeito
Sem compromisso eu respeito
Mas não quero mais

Eu não quero mais
Te amar demais, me entregar demais
Pra você dizer que tanto faz (eu não quero mais)
Não quero mais
Eu não quero mais
Te amar demais pra sofrer demais
Por alguém que diz que tanto faz (eu não quero mais)
Não quero mais

Mais uma vez o nosso amor
Se perdeu porque eu falei demais
Mais uma vez não dei valor
E você quer me deixar pra trás

Sem teu calor tudo é pior
Tua indiferença dói demais
Cadê você, meu grande amor
Eu prometo que não erro mais

E te confesso que um beijo
Já me desperta o desejo
Do que a gente faz
E se for pra ser do seu jeito
É só dizer eu aceito
Pra te ver em paz

Eu não quero mais
Te amar demais, me entregar demais
Pra você dizer que tanto faz (eu não quero mais)
Não quero mais, nunca mais, eu
Eu não quero mais
Pra sofrer demais
E dizer meu bem que tanto faz (eu não quero mais)
Não quero mais, nunca mais

Eu 'to aqui só a dois passos de você
Você 'tá aí a dez mil milhas pra entender
Pra decidir se vai fugir ou vai querer

Eu 'to aqui a um passo de te esquecer
Você 'tá aí a um segundo de ver
Que eu sou capaz de dizer não quero mais

Eu não quero mais
Me entregar demais
E depois dizer que tanto faz (eu não quero mais)
Não quero mais, nunca mais

Eu não quero mais (não quero mais)
Te amar demais pra sofrer demais (quero mais, quero mais)
Por alguém que diz, que diz que tanto faz (eu não quero mais)
Não quero mais",Não Quero Mais

Hi
You must be new I guess At least you're new to me
Saw you unpacking your car So I said to myself
Maybe I should help her out Since we're neighbors now
And all the other people here are elderly And probably a little standoffish
And I've got nothing to do (and whatnot)
By the way I live in 207 My name is Greg
Wherever are my manners Let me get that heavy box

I'm a go-getter guy
With a gun on my hip
But just searching for that someone
To be firing it
I've narrowed down the field
And I'm taking a glance
And I'd say you've got a pretty good chance
To be my girlfriend

What's up Didn't mean to sneak up on you there
I looked downstairs and saw you leaving
So what's up
I haven't seen you at the pool Since the barbecue
Not that I've been checking Here's the deal
I've got this thing For work this weekend And I was wondering If you don't have Anything going on That maybe
OK, hey that's cool You're busy
But we should hit up Jose O'Flannegens For Jello shots Your call
It's OK not this week
But Monday You could come over tonight I'll be watching cop dramas Smoking fatty fatties

And I really think
That you could use A guy like me

A man to take you home A hand for you to hold
And I'd never Leave you alone!

Ludo,"I'll tell it like it happened, it was Darius and Noland and me,
Just a few po' boys trying to get up out of Missouri.
Took 55 to Louisiana, stopped by the highway to eat.
They both had craw fish, strictly chicken for me.
Back out under thunderheads, the radio was Southern soul.
They interrupted Clarence Carter with a strange-ass local show.
They were sayin'

""Come down to Lake Pontchartrain.
Rest your soul and feed your brain.
That's where you will get to see everything the water can be.""

The rain was comin' down, the wind was howlin' outside of Slidell.
It was the kind of night that makes you think the whole world's goin' to hell.
We got off on an exit 'cause we couldn't read the map so great.
Near the Choctaw Motel, we parked to deliberate,
When out of the bayou came a man like the lake had a tongue.
He was right up on the glass, all yellow-eyed, black teeth, bangin' on the windshield,
Screamin' like a demon at the top of his lungs,

""Come down to Lake Pontchartrain.
Rest your soul and feed your brain.
Free for you and all your friends.
Craw fish 'til the bitter end.
Come down to Lake Pontchartrain.
Wade to where the shallows break.
That's where you will get to see everything the water can be.""

I was drivin' out of there as fast as a Camry could,
But the interstate was flooded, so I had to take the road through the woods.
Bad move in retrospect; the road disappeared in the rain,
And I stood on the brakes when I saw the sign:
""Lake Pontchartrain""
Darius was yelling that he saw somebody out in the swells,
He jumped out, runnin', and Noland was goin' as well.
""Come back!"" Why the hell would they leave the car?
And that's when I heard it, make no mistake
The voices were calling them from under the lake

Come down to Lake Pontchartrain

Come down to Lake Pontchartrain

Come down to Lake Pontchartrain

Come down to Lake Pontchartrain

The craw fish were screaming, the waves danced in time.
My friends went in deeper, the water, it climbed.
I watched in terror. The lake opened wide
And horribly roaring, it pulled them inside.
That's how it happened! Why would I lie?
There were no bodies, I've got none to hide.
I'm just a boy, lost his friends in the rain.
Any more questions, just go and ask Lake Pontchartrain.",Lake Pontchartrain

Waitin' desperately to get out of town.

Consider what you might have found.

It wasn't meant to end this way
But we can save it if we try
Foolish mistakes we make

Two stubborn people (were trying to hide)
The feelings were feeling inside

And anyone can see
We still love each other
And anyone can see that we still do care
And anyone can see
It's all still there
Don't say it's gone
This great gift of love we've got going on (we might hurt each other)
When we start to fuss and fight (but it just doesn't matter)
When were making love it doesn't matter who's wrong or right

And baby you better believe me (we might hurt each other)

Que prefieres alguien como yo que te haga reír

Y me preguntas si me puedes abrazar
Digo que sí y te acercas a mí

Sólo me buscas cuando me necesitas
Si estás triste o te sientes solita
Hace tiempo que no sé nada de ti
Si todo está bien con él ni pasas por aquí

Ni un texto, al parecer no existo
Yo no te molesto ni insisto
Sólo deseo que tengas otra pelea
Es la única oportunidad para que te vea

Qué iluso soy, soy un sángano
Que pierde el tiempo en vano
Sólo me sirve que tarde o temprano
Él te haga sentir mal y así yo gano

Pero en realidad no gano, qué va
Sólo me usas y luego te vas
Para ti soy tu desquite y nada más
Tan sólo soy tu paño de lágrimas

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Forse non sarà domani
Ma un bel giorno cambierà

Preferirei sapere che piangi
Che mi rimproveri di averti delusa
E non vederti sempre così dolce

Mi fa disperare il pensiero di te
E di me che non so darti di più

Y es que odio el aerosol
Que combate tu calor

Que te sujeta para sí

Luis Alberto Spinetta,"No sigas siempre en la pared
tan fría está
no le digas nada a la pared
no escuchará
sin embargo en las sombras
se escucha una música como si ya no estuviera aquí
no sigas solo en la pared
no tiene caso
no el pidas nada a la pared
no escuchará
se oye acaso un gemido
detrás de la nada
sólo cuando estoy lejos de ti...
inmóvil siempre
al pared se cansará
no te vuelvas como la pared justo ahora
un insólito abismo testea los cuerpos
que tan sólo habitan lo que fue
siempre en la red
siempre en la pared
siempre en la pared
no beses sólo la pared
no tiene caso
tan blanca como la pared te cansarás
no le pidas un surco no pidas palabras
sólo un viejo
musgo nacerá
oh !",Siempre en la Pared
Luis Alberto Spinetta,"Casualmente yo te conocí
Una noche como hoy
Tu vestido eléctrico me hirió
Vos bailabas y decías
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby

Luego te mudaste con tu séquito
A mi lujosa mansión
Hasta casi entro en tu narcogate
Vos bailabas y decías
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby

Chiquitita pero se que me extrañas con 
Todas las fuerzas de tu alma eah"" 

No se que en lo que pensaba en entregarte 
Todo el alma en darte todo mi cariño por la 
Conciencia que me lastimaras extrañare mucho

Solo en la cama cuando me aranabas la espalda

Tu prefieres una soda, 
No buscas impresionarme

Y lo que me gusta mas 
Es esa timidez que no te deja hablar, 
Pero me lo dices todo 
Cuando yo te beso con intensidad 

Es tu timidez lo que provoca que 
Te ame cada día como nunca ame, 
Escondes tus piernas bajo la mezclilla 
Y para que me mires jalo tu barbilla 

Es tu timidez la que me vuelve loco 
Te da tanta pena mirarme a los ojos, 
Pero se que me amas por que tus latidos 
Son a mil coronas cuando estas conmigo, 
Cuando estas conmigo

Están detrás de esos lentes

Me ha robado el alma un gran suspiro

Hace que su cuerpo se derrita

Que está su nombre
En todas mis libretas

Cómo le digo
Que me trae loco

De sus lindos ojos

Cómo le hago

Que escribo te amo

Cómo le puedo
Comunicar
Que ella es la niña
Que me ha vuelto a enamorar

(Luis Eduardo Aute)

Y van pasando los años
Y al fin la vida no puede ser
sólo un tiempo que hay que recorrer
a través del dolor y el placer;
quién nos compuso el engaño
de que existir es apostar a no perder.
Vivir es más que un derecho,
es el deber de no claudicar
el mandato de reflexionar
qué es nacer, qué es morir, qué es amar.
el hombre, por qué está hecho
y qué eres tú, libertad,
libertad, libertad, libertad.
La idea no es razonable,
tampoco el verbo fundamental;
¿es el alma principio o final,
o armonía del bien frente al mal?
qué es el amor insondable
que empuja al cuerpo a ser incógnita
inmortal.
El siglo está agonizando

Luis Eduardo Aute,"No se me ocurre otra manera 
De seguir en pie de guerra 
Que cobijarme entre tus brazos 
Practicando el cuerpo a tierra
Y camuflarme con tu carne 
En su pasión más incivil 
Para hacer frente a la jauría 
Cuando escape del redil. 

No se me ocurre otra manera 
De seguir en la trinchera 
Con un beso por fusil

No se me ocurre otra manera 
De seguir no sé hacia dónde
Que ir tras el humo que señala 
El fuego que tu cuerpo esconde 
Para encontrar la luz fugaz, 
De algún relámpago de abril 
Que me descubra un claroscuro, 
Una silueta algún perfil. 

No se me ocurre otra manera 
De vencer la eterna duda 
Que someterme a la verdad finita 
De tu piel desnuda, 
Más poderosa que la tiranía 
De cualquier reptil 
Encaramado a las basuras 
De su torre de marfil",Con un Beso Por Fusil
Luis Eduardo Aute,"De pronto vi prodigios,
Mareas de sombra y de luz
Subiendo por tu cuerpo
En el centro de un contraluz
Oculto, a tus espaldas,
El sol levantaba un altar
La luna en tu pupila
Era una perla flotando en el mar
Y desperté 
Del sueño o maravilla, 
No lo sé 
Y me volví, 
Dormías dulcemente 
Junto a mí 
""Despierta, amor"" 
Te dije y todo ardía 
Alrededor. 
Volvieron los prodigios, 
Pero ahora eran pura verdad 
Tu cuerpo era la tierra 
Y yo, el centro de gravedad 
El tiempo se detuvo 
Creando un instante inmortal 
Tu cuerpo era el principio 
Y el mío, su punto final 
Y me dormí, 
Vencido por el sueño 
Junto a ti 
Luego soñé, 
Soñé que despertaba 
Y te busqué 
Te fuiste, amor 
Y sólo hubo ceniza 
Alrededor. 
Y ya no vi prodigios 
Ni luces, ni sombras, ni mar 
Tu cuerpo era un vacío 
Y su centro, el frío polar 
El sol de medianoche 
Cayó en un eclipse total 
La luna dibujaba una guadaña 
De juicio final.. 
Y desperté 
Del sueño o pesadilla, 
No lo sé 
Te descubrí 
Velando mis terrores 
Junto a mí 
Volviste, amor 
Y ardía el Universo

Luis Eduardo Aute,"Más que amor, lo que siento por ti.
Es el mal del animal, no la terquedad del jabalí, ni la furia del chacal...
Es el alma que se encela con instinto criminal, es amar, hasta que duela
como un golpe de puñal... ay, amor, ay, dolor...
yo te quiero con alevosía...

Necesito confundir tu piel con el frío del metal
o tal vez con el destello cruel de un fragmento de cristal...
Quiero que tus sentimientos sean puro mineral
polvo de cometa al viento del espacio sideral... ay, amor, ay, dolor...
yo te quiero con alevosía.

Luis Eduardo Aute,"Hoy tengo un día de ésos en que mandaría
Todo a hacer puñetas
Incluso firmaría con placer el acta
De mi rendición
Diría ""adiós a todo eso"" como Graves
O incluso en plan asceta
Me subiría a una columna en el desierto
Como un San Simón
O, como Onetti, acaso intentaría no dejar
Jamás el lecho
O pillaría el primer vuelo al Himalaya
Para hacerme Zen
Pero, maldita sea, cómo dar el salto
De lo dicho al hecho
Contigo, ahí, desnuda, repitiéndome: ""amor mío
Ven, ven, ven""

Sólo por ti sigo aquí
Imán de mujer, imán de mujer
Me voy a perder
Pero sin salir de ti

Que el mundo fue y será una porquería
Ya lo dijo Enrique Santos
Y hoy tengo un día de esos en que sufro
Toda esa poesía cruel
Aunque que temo que yo mismo soy quien
Me produzco más espanto
Al verme comprendiendo las razones de Caín
Matando a Abel
Me fugaría a Transilvania para convertirme
En un vampiro
Para no ver tras el espejo al bicho infame
Que dice ser yo
Pero me abrazas y aún sabiendo que tus brazos
Son un mal retiro
Me tiro a tus infiernos donde habita
El diablo que te re-creó",Iman de Mujer

Que duro es quererte así
Contigo pero sin ti
Amando tu cuerpo
Pero tu a años luz de mí

No quiero saber porque
Para que arriesgarme a que me respondas
No lo se….

Prefiero sospecharte en otros brazos
why partirme en mil pedazos
A seguir muerto de pie

Como romper con tu indiferencia
Como vencer …. esta mala querencia por ti
Querencia por ti

Carencia de ti
Querencia por ti

Te miro pero no estas
why veo un puñal detrás
Dispuesto a asestarme el golpe
De un nunca jamás

Tu tibio dejar de hacer
No es más que una forma lenta de desaparecer
Una manera de emprender la huida
A través de este suicida
Sin un lacro de placer

Como vencer está mala querencia por ti

Tu voz resucita mis músculos dormidos 
mis latidos sepultados.

I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned

That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

De eterna evolución

Raro, inmensamente humano
De paz y sobresaltos

Mi mundo es complicado
Difícil de explorarlo
Difícil de vivir

Pero es mío es el mundo mío
Lleno de triunfos y fracasos
Virtudes y pecados
Y en el no cabes tu

Que trabajo te cuesta ser original
Hacer una locura y soñar
En tu mundo no hay
Nada de espontaneidad
Tu mundo está vacío

Y tú no entiendes nada del mío
Yo tengo un mundo mío
Y voy a compartirlo
Con alguien como yo

Sueños de amor y fantasías
Serán las normas mías
Para regir mi vida

Así es el mundo mío solo mío
Y en el no cabes tu

Frágil lleno de virtudes
Y de pecados pero nunca tan vacio

Y por no apreciar todo este calor
Hoy todo es dolor en tu mundo frio

Expresar lo que por mucho tiempo he estado sintiendo

Sentirás que tu cuerpo poco a poco irá bailando

Viviré porque hoy se ha escalado otro peldaño

Matar el amor que por ti siento
Solo, me encuentro solo
Sigo aquí, solo estoy

De soledad añorando el pasado
Solo me encuentro solo

No tema usted si al llamar solo el silencio responde 
Y es que estamos amándonos 
Y en la piel sepultando penas 
Y es que tu encierras tanto amor en tus venas 

Tu me quemas 
Cuando me rosan tus rodillas 
Tu me quemas 
Cuando me abrazas y me mimas 
Tu me quemas 
Ni el agua de los mares calmara esta hoguera 
Tu me quemas 
Tu me quemas 
Tu hierbes en mi sangre al mirarte nena 
Me vuelves loco y no convino mis ideas 
No se lo que me pasa y pierdo la cabeza 
En tus brazos, tu me quemas 

En una cama de hotel tu y yo en silencio en el alma 
Dos cuerpos muertos de sed entre unas sabanas blancas 
Casi dos meses después cuando ni tu lo esperabas 
Te convencí de mi amor casándonos de mañana 
Y seguimos amándonos y en la piel sepultando penas 
Y es que tu encierras tanto amor en tus venas 

Tu me quemas 
Cuando me rosan tus rodillas 
Tu me quemas 
Cuando me abrazas y me mimas 
Tu me quemas 
Ni el agua de los mares calmara esta hoguera

(es que encierras tanto amor que tu me quemas) 
Chica contigo yo me siento un hombre nuevo 
Por que te hago sentir bien mujer 
(es que encierras tanto amor que tu me quemas) 
Tu me quemas con todo lo que encierras dentro de ti 
Y entre mas lo hacemos todavía mas queremos 
(es que encierras tanto amor que tu me quemas) 
Tu forma de querer es lo que yo había soñado 
Por eso es que te amo 
(es que encierras tanto amor que tu me quemas) 

(jugando a besarnos y a darnos cariño muchacha) 

(seguimos) 
(es que encierras tanto amor que tu me quemas) 
Nuestros cuerpos expresan emociones 
Y encuentran afinidad 
(es que encierras tanto amor que tu me quemas) 
Por eso, por eso,por eso es que nos gusta 
Cuando lo hacemos ya que sabemos disfrutar 
(es que encierras tanto amor que tu me quemas)

Que siempre vamos por mas

Luis Enrique,"Amiga esa noche hacia frio y yo estaba perdido
Me sentía triste y decidí buscar amigos
Tomar algunas copas y vine hablar contigo
Amiga tu bien sabes lo importante

Que ella era en mi vida
La perdí como perdiste tú a cien serias
Y vine a desahogarme contigo amiga mía

Una copa me diste y brindamos
Y juramos los dos olvidarnos
Io de ella y tu de el
Y bebiendo otra vez

Con el vino el dolor
Se fue ahogando
De repente te estaba abrazando
No sé cómo hasta el suelo llegamos

Te empecé a desnudar
Y empezamos a amar
Como locos los dos enredados
Amiga, amiga

Amiga esa noche no éramos nosotros eran las copas
Por que cuando yo te amaba a ti veía a otra
Y tú cuando besabas, besabas otra boca

(Nos perdimos entre copas y abrazos en la soledad, amiga)
Olvidando yo a ella y tú a él y bebiendo otra vez tu boca fue mía
(Nos perdimos entre copas y abrazos en la soledad, amiga)
Ay amor ce bien se borro el triste dolor ce mi alma sentía

(Nos perdimos entre copas y abrazos en la soledad)
Te tuve que amar
(Amiga)
Abrazándote llego el amanecer, desperté y no lo creía

(Nos perdimos entre copas y abrazos en la soledad)
No, no, no pude aguantar
(Amiga)
Abrásame fuerte y bésame con todo tu voz me decía

(Nos perdimos entre copas y abrazos en la soledad)
Y te escuche suspirar
(Amiga)
No es una sola, no es una sola puede pasar más de una vez en la vida

(Nos perdimos entre copas y abrazos en la soledad)
No hay nada ce reprochar
(Amiga)
Todo termino como empezó, siempre serás amiga mía

Luis Enrique,"Siento que has cambiado nunca fuiste mía
Como hoy pero ante todo a terminado sin razón
No encuentro explicación me llevas el corazón

Nunca fuiste mía tan solo mentías mientras
Yo creía en tus palabras de amor
Pero aun no puedo olvidarte hoy te extraño amor

Fui una aventura más en ti un juego fácil por vivir
Sólo fingiste amor mientras yo confiaba en ti

Nunca fuiste mía tan solo mentías mientras
Yo creía en tus palabras de amor
Pero aun no puedo olvidarte hoy te extraño amor

Fui una aventura más en ti un juego fácil por vivir
Sólo fingiste amor mientras yo confiaba en ti
Fui una aventura más en ti un pasatiempo en tu vivir
Sólo fingiste amor mientras yo

Una aventura más en ti
Solo fui, solo fui
Siento que has cambiado tu nunca fuiste mía, mía
Como hoy

Una aventura más en ti
Sin razón yo fui
Solo fui

No encuentro explicación
Me llevas toda mi vida todo el corazón

Una aventura más en ti
Solo fui, solo fui
Nunca fuisteis mía
Sólo mentías mientras yo creía

Una aventura más en ti
Sabes bien que fui
Solo fui

Un pasatiempo
Un juego tan fácil por vivir
Porque fui
Solo fui

Una aventura más
Un pasatiempo en tu vivir
Fingiste cariño y nunca sentiste así

Solo fui
Como un barco de venida

Entre vicios raros, mujersuelas why cantinas

Que de algo hay que morirse en esta vida

Esta vez ni un beso ni un adiós
Se le hacía tarde y los minutos
Aumentaban su preocupación

Al volver con él, hace pedazos mi vida
El no es más que una rutina sin amor
Y me tiene a mí, un laberinto es mi vida
Sin entrada sin salida me estoy muriendo sin vivir

Aquí estoy yo con mi dilema
Comprometiendo más mi corazón
Y sigo pagando un alto
Precio por su amor

Aquí estoy yo con mi dilema
Llego el momento de una decisión
Yo no hablo por hablar
Y mis palabras van mi amor es el o yo

Esta habitación me vuelve loco
Me destruye tanta frialdad
Nunca he pedido lo imposible
Donde está su sensibilidad

Y mis palabras van mi amor

Aquí estoy yo con mi dilema
Perdido en el silencio sin saber lo siente ni lo que piensa
Aquí estoy yo con mi dilema
En esta habitación vacía se desgarra mi alma sin su presencia

Aquí estoy yo con mi dilema
Si se queda o se va necesito su respuesta sincera
Aquí estoy yo con mi dilema
Me destruye la frialdad el desamor y su inconsciencia

Aquí estoy yo con mi dilema
Le llamo me llama, quiero

Noté el desorden y tú, la mujer habilitada
Dos desayunos señor, para la suite 911
No toque usted al llamar, sólo el silencio responde

Es que estamos amandonos
En la piel se ocultan tus penas
Es que tú encierras tanto amor en tus venas

Tu me quemas, cuando me rozan tus rodillas
Tu me quemas, cuando me abrazas y me mimas
Tu me quemas, ni el agua de los mares calmará esta hoguera
Tú me quemas

Tu me quemas, tú hierves en mi sangre al mirarte, nena
Me vuelves loco y no combino mis ideas
No sé lo que me pasa y pierdo la cabeza en tus brazos
Tú me quemas, nanánanana

En una cama de hotel, intuyo el silencio en el alma
Dos cuerpos muertos de sed entre unas sábanas blancas
Casi dos meses después, cuando ni tú lo esperabas
Te convencí de mi amor, casándonos de mañana

Y seguimos amandonos
En la piel se ocultan tus penas
Es que tú encierras tanto amor, en tus venas

Tu me quemas, cuando me rozan tus rodillas
Tu me quemas, cuando me abrazas y me mimas
Tu me quemas, ni el agua de los mares calmará esta hoguera

El que tenga algo que decir
Que se calle la boca

La boda de ella tiene que ser la mejor
Va a estar llena de cariño y también de mucho amor
La boda de ella siempre va ser comentada
Pues va a ver mucho champán y también piña colada

A la boda de ella yo no voy a poder ir
Porque ella fue mí querer y me lo tiene prohibido
La boda de ella yo me la voy a perder
Y pude haber sido yo quien se casara con ella

La boda de ella tiene que ser la mejor
Necesitaras una madrina también un padrino
Y un alcahuete que te cargue los anillos

La boda de ella tiene que ser la mejor
Si tú me acostumbraste
A tener que agacharme en el balcón

La boda de ella tiene que ser la mejor
Pasarán más de mil años muchos más
Y a tu carácter nunca se acostumbrará

La boda de ella tiene que ser la mejor
Paso por la calle y me tira una mirada bien mala
Que le pasa a ese señor

La boda de ella tiene que ser la mejor

Novia que esconde su pecado
Hasta después de la ceremonia

Hay que buscarle la vuelta

Cambia de color cambia de guru de chaman 
Cambia el norte y cambia el sur 
Y veras que va cambiando todo",Cambia
Luis Enrique,"No te lo voy a repetir
Tú eres la única persona
Que a mis locuras se acomoda
Porque conoces mis defectos y mis luces

No te lo voy a repetir
Que tú eres lo único en el mundo
Que me ha llevado de la mano a algún lugar
Y que a mi vida puso un rumbo

Y te lo voy a repetir
Porque tú nunca me has creído, corazón
Porque tú sientes que no tengo la razón
Y cada vez que tú te marchas, pierdo yo

Como volver a ser feliz
Cuando este día se parece al fin del mundo
Como volver a ser feliz
Si tu partida me ha tirado a lo profundo

Solo tú sabes mi amor
Como volver a ser feliz

No te lo voy a repetir
Voy recogiendo las cenizas
Porque esta vida va de prisa, corazón
Y no sanan las heridas

No te lo voy a repetir
Que por ti vivo muriendo
Este exilio se hace eterno, por favor
Ponle fin que ya no puedo

No te lo voy a repetir
Porque tú nunca me has creído, corazón
Porque tú piensas que no tengo la razón
Y cada vez que tú te marchas pierdo yo

Cómo volver a ser feliz
Cuando este día se parece al fin del mundo
Cómo volver a ser feliz
Si tú partida me ha tirado a lo profundo

Solo tú sabes mi amor
Cómo volver a ser feliz

Más que hablar, solo intento despertar
Algún motivo en tu conciencia
Sólo quiero en recompensa
Encontrar lo que tú eras, como, cómo

No se puede vivir así,
Como volver a ser feliz
Si tu partida me ha tirado a lo profundo
Y así no puedo vivir, no puedo seguir

No se puede vivir así
(Te digo que no puedo)
Cómo volver a ser feliz

Porque sin ti vivo muriendo
Porque que este exilio se hace eterno
Y solo tú puedes ponerle fin

Oye
Cómo volver a ser feliz
Alberto dime

Cómo volver a ser feliz
Me duele tanto vivir así y es que sin ti
Todavía no he vuelto a ser feliz

",Cómo Volver a Ser Feliz
Luis Enrique,"Tanto amor entre nosotros dos
Rumbo sin direccion de un largo viaje
Una trampa del destino conocerte
Sabiendo que siempre seras mia sin tenerte

Entre dos mundos se dividio
Y la indecision de darme amante
Intentaba separarme de ella entiendo
Pero nunca traicionandome con celos

Como amigo si como amantes no
El amor que vivi contigo me lo llevo yo
Como amigo si como amantes no
Yo sere para ti lo prohibido

El que te enseño
A sentir por primera vez
Y a querer pero no a tener
El amor que sueñas

Entre dos mundos se dividio
Y la indecision de darme amante
Intentaba separarme de ella entiendo
Pero nunca traicionandome con celos

Como amigo si como amantes no
El amor que vivi contigo me lo llevo yo
Como amigo si como amantes no
Yo sere para ti lo prohibido

El que te enseño
A sentir por primera vez
Y a querer pero no a tener
El amor que sueñas

Como amigo
Yo te ame
Como amigo
Sere tu amigo

Como amigo
Sere tu mejor amigo pues
Ser tu amante no quiero
Ya no voy a retroceder

",Inocencia
Luis Enrique,"Hermoso Bouquet
A ti te traemos
Bellísimas flores
Del jardín riqueño

Hermoso Bouquet
A ti te traemos
Bellísimas flores
Del jardín riqueño

De todas las flores
Yo te traigo un ramo
Recíbelo bien
Que éste es tu aguinaldo

Traigo lirios blancos
También azucenas
Las ramas de noche
Flor de yerba buena

Entra tantas flores
Hoy nos despedimos
Como se despiden
El nardo y el lirio

",No Me des la Espalda
Luis Enrique,"No sé si está fallando 
Algo tuyo ya no es lo mismo 
Y quiero saber que nos sucede 
Si es que como antes tu a mi me quieres 

Tengo en mi cabeza 
Dudas, frases, que me dijiste a oscuras 
Ojos azul marino que por las noches 
Me dieron frío 

No te escondas quiero verte bien 
La cara 
No te vayas que yo iré detrás de ti 

Ya no importa si me dices que 
No me amas 
Solamente quiero reclamarte 
Todo lo que hice por ti

Que te vaya bien sin mi 
Si te veo no te conocí 
No es tan fácil pero es parte de este juego 

El teléfono nunca más sonó 
Ella por mi calle nunca más pasó 
No es tan fácil formar parte de 
Tu juego 

Quédate con mi cariño 
Tenlo y ponlo donde tu quieras 
Solo me arde en mi cabeza 
Tus pensamientos que se me queman 

No te escondas quiero verte bien 
La cara 
No te vayas que yo iré detrás de ti 

Ya no importa si me dices que 
No me amas 
Solamente quiero reclamarte 
Todo lo que hice por ti

Que te vaya bien sin mi 
Si te veo no te conocí 
No es tan fácil pero es parte de este juego 

El teléfono nunca más sonó 
Ella por mi calle nunca más pasó 
No es tan fácil formar parte de 
Tu juego 

Es parte de este juego 
No no es fácil 
Es parte de este juego 
No sé que está pasando hoy 
Algo en ti ha cambiado 
No escondas mas la cara 
Y dime que no me amas 

Hoy quiero reclamarte 
Quiero desahogarme 
No puedo estar a oscuras 
Quiero borrar mis dudas 

Yo sé que es parte de este juego 
Yo sé que es parte de tu juego 
Es parte de este juego 
De tu juego 

Dímelo ahora si 

No es fácil ser parte de tu juego",Parte de Este Juego
