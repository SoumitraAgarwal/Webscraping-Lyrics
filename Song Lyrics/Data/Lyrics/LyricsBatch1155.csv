Screaming Jets,"Know our first stop 
Fire Base Green, 
Got my AK-47 ready and clean.
Watching the treeline, 
I'm waiting for a break, 
I've got my finger on the trigger, 
And I just can't wait. 
There's gonna be no more fuckin' around, 
We're gonna get those commies and mow 'em all down.
Don't give a shit we want 'em to hit, 
We want 'em to hit, 
We want 'em to hit. 
At Fire Base Green, 
Lay Charlie clean, 
Tonight we go, 
We go to the Blue Sashes.
Know our first stop Fire Base Green, 
Got my AK-47 ready and clean.
Watching the treeline, 
I'm waiting for a break, 
I've got my finger on the trigger.
There's gonna be no more fuckin' around, 
We're gonna get those commies and mow 'em all down.
Said at Fire Base Green, 
Lay Charlie clean, 
Tonight we go, 
We go to the Blue Sashes. 
My Sarge got dusted off, 
I tie on my blue cloth, 
You know it's in my head, 
It's in my head, 
It's in my head. 
At Fire Base Green, 
Lay Charlie clean, 
Tonight we go, 
We go to the Blue Sashes.",Blue Sashes
Screaming Jets,"I watch my t.v. screen, life flashing before me.
So tell me what does that mean? And why does it bore me?
Come on, let me show you how to do it.
I hear the radio and the songs they play, makin' my stomach turn.
I just want to hear some Rock 'N' Roll, I watch my radio burn.
Come on, let me show you how to do it.
Come on, let me show you how to do it.
I see the plastic people, leading plastic lives.
Substitute child, disposable wife.
Follow your t.v., it is your guide. The family cries when the t.v. dies.
Come on, let me show you how to do it.
Come on, let me show you how to do it.",C'mon
Screaming Jets,"Well it's a hot night, 
Excitement,
And in the heat of the night, 
The flames ignited. 

I see you smiling, 
Standing there with so many beside you.
How can I choose from plastic faces and 
Christmas presents done up in June?

I don't know why I am what I am but that's alright.
But I can tell you this. 
You either got it or you ain't. 
You either got it or you ain't.

There's a cool breeze,
Blowin' through the city,
And in the heat of the night,
It sweetly kisses my skin. 

Mini-skirts, long legs and painted faces, 
Sin, sin, sin.
Well, I don't go just anywhere and I don't please just anyone that's right.
So if you fit the bill, 

Well c'mon baby show your skill tonight.
Tonight, tonight. 
You either got it or you ain't - have you got it? 
You either got it or you ain't 

Oh, show me.
It's such a hot night,
I'm undecided,
But in the heat of the night, 

I get so excited. 
I look around and see the scene of pretty faces and make-up dreams,
Of all you people, standing there, 
You looks won't get you anywhere at all.

Well I don't preach philosophy and I don't tell anybody just what they should be, 
But I can tell you this.
You either got it or you ain't, 
You either got it or you ain't, 

You either got it or you ain't,
And that's just about all.",Got It
Screaming Jets,"I won't say no more about, what we're talking 'bout.
I won't say another word. 
All my dreams that I try and tell you 'bout, you don't understand a word.
All the time and all the bridges over,

Water through our hearts and minds,
Now I see that all we had was nothing,
When all the time and all the lies. 
So I tell you now.

I won't say no more about, what we're talking 'bout.
I won't say another word.
All my dreams that I try and tell you 'bout,
You don't understand a word.

You and I and others we have been there,
We've hit the bottom and not the top,
So who would have thought 
That all we had had fallen,

When all the dreams I have, I'm goin' up. So I tell you know.
As you sit there smiling,
Not a thing can make me see that you have changed.
Break away from death's road.

We had dreams about that fame and fortune,
Said I'm gonna make it and be a star.
All of our names remembered by the people.
I should have known that we could never go that far.",No Point
Screaming Jets,"Is there such a thing as senility, 
Is it an old mind is it there all the time?
Is there such a thing as the human race, 
Brothers and sisters.

People say I live in a fantasy world, 
I just do what I do. 
I don't like to be told
Others stop and say my whole life is a dream, 

But you don't understand. 
So that's why
You look at me and tell me what do you see?
Why don't you let me be cause I'm not the only one.

Look at me and tell me what do you see, 
Why don't you set me free
Well the cold hard facts of make believe.
I'm down on my knees and I'm begging please.

I reach this place and I'm off my face, 
But no-one can tell me.
I know that I have to come back home, 
'Cause sometimes I don't like being alone

Every now and then I need someone else, 
I get tired of myself, 
So tired.
You look at me and tell me what do you see, 

Why don't you let me be
'Cause I'm not the only one.
You look at me and tell me what do you see, 
You gotta set me free

You look at me and tell me what do you see, 
Why don't you let me be.
I'm not the only one.
You look at me tell me what do you see, 

Why don't you set me free?
Gotta break free
You know what makes me sick?
I see the nameless faces in empty places, 

With the colourless skies above
Feeling hungry and cold why wasn't I told about all push and no shove?
Don't tell what you want me to be, 
I'm not the only one

I don't care what you see in me, 
I'm not the only one
So don't tell me what you want me to be
I'm not the only one.",The Only One [*]
Screaming Jets,"Cold steel rails in front of me, my steel city left behind. 
Miles and miles of miles to go, it's another lonely night. 
I see the tunnel up ahead is dark, it opens up and swallows me whole.
Can't see the light at the other end now. Sometime its gotta show. 

I see my light shining through. 
Shine on. 
Shine on.
I've got the time to say to my friend, 

Hey friend, that this ain't no easy road,
But it's the way I must travel, even if I have to ho alone.
I've seen the dreams of a broken man, broken, shattered and torn,
Have to stand on my own two feet, some time my day is gonna dawn. 

I see the day is coming, won't have to wait no more. 
I feel the rays-a-burning, burning through my open door, shine on through, shine on through. 
Three days, 1500 miles quickly turns into a week. 
Don't know my direction and I just can't get no sleep. 

This petty ego is thriving on a teenage dream, it won't be long before we arrive, 
Down on loser's street, yeah.
I see my light shining through,
I see my light shining through, 

I see my light shining through,
My light a-shining through, 
See the light shine through, 
Shine on.",Shine On
Screaming Jets,"That's right. 
Her name is Sister Tease, 
She really knows how to please. 
Yeah she'll kiss your lips, 

She'll have you doin' backflips,
Yeah, but that's her game, 
Oh she'll drive me insane.
When she grabs my mane, 

I'm goin' outta my brain.
I feel the blood rush past, 
Oh, I hope I can last, 
But the end is near, 

Come on sister dear.
Oh Sister Tease, 
She really knows how to please.
Sister Tease, 

You drive me to my knees. 
C'mon sister please, 
Be my tease. 
Well I'm in my room, 

And she rides my broom.
Oh what a witch, 
The dirty little bitch.
But what a way to be pleased,

Come over here, 
Sister Tease.
Well I'm in my room, 
And she rides my broom.

Screaming Jets,"What a lovely way to start a Saturday, 
And what a lovely time I'm having too.
There is no other way I'd spend my Saturday, 
In fact there's nothing else I'd rather do.

That may be so but what about the turns and the temptations, 
You keep hanging there.
Starting out it doesn't take the best of me, 
The hard part's when it gets towards the end. 

Starting out it doesn't take the best of me, 
The solitude ends up my only friend. 
Maybe I'm supposed to be your enemy, 
Maybe I'm supposed to be your friend?

Maybe you don't want to know me, 
And maybe you're set on demands,
And maybe you don't even understand. 
That may be so but what about the turns and the temptations, 

You keep hanging there. 
Starting out it doesn't take the best of me, 
The hard part's when it gets towards the end. 
Starting out it doesn't take the best of me, that's when the solitude ends up my only friend,

My only friend, 
My only friend.
Starting out it doesn't take the best of me, 
You know the hard part's when it gets towards the end. 

Starting out it doesn't take the best of me, 
Well I said, 
The solitude ends up my only friend. 
Starting out it doesn't take the best of me, that's when the solitude ends up my only friend, 

My only friend, 
My only friend.",Starting Out
Screaming Jets,"Well I've got all these thoughts 
Turning in my head,
I have to write it all down, 
Trying to keep my head above the water, 

Stuck in a one horse town.
I know I've got something but I can't put my finger on it. 
But everytime I think about it, 
It disappears. 

Stop the world, cause this is where I get off. 
Well you can all carry on, 
But just stop the world. 
Well I can feel myself, 

Tumbling and fall,
But I can get back up on my feet, 
'Cause I got something I'd like to show you all.
I know I've got something but I can't put my finger on it. 

But everytime I think about it, 
It disappears. 
Stop the world, 
'Cause this is where I get off. 

Well you can all carry on, someone please stop the world. 
So c'mon stop the world, cause this is where I get off, 
Well you can all carry on, but just stop the world. 
Stop. 

Stop.",Stop the World
Screaming Jets,"I find it hard to eat, and I just can,t sleep
My world is upside down
I'm trying to be the real me
Am I true or just a clown
A weaving path before me lies
A life of highs and lows
What will it make of me?
I really just don't know
I look at the sunshine
But I live for the night
All the things I do to myself
Am I wrong or am I right?
Indecision has me, confusion a state of mind
I hope someone can help
I look, I feel, but I don't find
What I really want 
What I really need
I don't ask for to much
I feel no greed
I just want the best for you and that's all
Well, I have been there and back 
Too many times before
But it always comes around, knocking on my door
It scared me then, just like it scares me now
Amid this danger and obsession
What am I doing?
What I really want
What I really need
I don't ask for to much
I feel no greed
I just want the best for you and that's all
No more chances are left for me
Oh no, you really just don't seem to see the need
Too many lonely times
I have crossed over the line of sensibility
My coffee's hot and my bed is cold
I was young but I've grown so old
It scares me now
Oh, I tell you that it scared me them
I hope someone's gonna help
I look and feel, where can I find it ?
What I really want (really want)
What I really need (really need)
I said that I don't ask for to much
I feel no greed
Just give me the best of you
I just want the best of you.",Best of You
Screaming Jets,"Blood drips down venetian blinds
I cut myself on the glass I grind
I'm on my knees on the floor|
Carpet stained with whiskey and blood
I don't know why I'm doing so much
I hurt but I feel no pain
When I see the morning rise
And I kick myself and I realize
I'm out on that road alone again
So I search my mind, destroy my soul
Turn my collar against the cold
I can't get of the road I'm on
I find solace in an empty shot glass
So I'll just keep dreaming on, dreaming on, dreaming on
I'm to scared to close my eyes
I get nightmares in starry skies
When will all of this end?
I'm on this merry-go-round
I'm up and then I'm down
I can't tell what's happened to me
I see no future in a death wish user
I'll just keep dreaming on, dreaming on, dreaming on
Said I'm dreaming on
Well it seems more or less, that I'm traped by my
own regrets, and I just can't see it any other way
Well I don't know why I can't say no
But it's just like a fever and it grows
It's getting stronger everyday
Too scared to close my eyes
I have nightmares and its' no surprise
Oh is it ever going to end
I'm on this merry go round
You take me up and you're taking me down
And I can't tell what's happening to me
But there's no horizons
Cause there's to much lying
I'll just keep dreaming on
Yeah now, I can see no future and that's for death wish users
I just keep dreaming on, dreaming on
Yeah dreaming on 
Said I'm dreaming on ,on & on & on",Dream On
Screaming Jets,"Sometimes, things get a little hazy
Sometimes, I think I'm just a little crazy
I don't even know my own name
Soon all of me will go up in flames

Wearing scars, on my arms and in my eyes
Are you friends or enemies in disguise
So hard, when everything just runs against me
Jealous words, turn into a love/hate frenzy

Won't someone, lend me a helping hand
Time is up, to the time that's left undone
Time to grab my hat, grab my coat, I gotta load my gun
Silly things always always are the ones that turn out worst

And it seams
The ones that love you always hurt you the most
Won't someone, please understand
Won't someone, lend me a helping hand

Won't someone, please take the time to think
That your actions and words
They don't always say what they mean
Since I was a child, I used to dream of many things

Superstars, the bizzare, kings and their pretty queens
Now it seems, I need a shot, a drink to jog my thoughts
Why does this happen all the time
Is ti, is it just because 

Because no-one will understand
Won't someone, lend me a helping hand
Won't someone, take the time to think
That your actions and words

They don't always say what they mean.",Helping Hand

Voices scream insane
Calling out to let me go
Just let me go

I have thought for far to long
Is it right , or is it wrong
Now I think that's my mind
It's just loosing time

But it takes so much time before you realise
Why some things never change
They always stay just the same
The first taste of death is sweet

Feel it burning , an internal heat
Driving me into white light, killing time
Well , it takes so much time before you realise
Why some things never change

They always stay, just the same
There's no comeback
When your playing with a stacked deck
If you loose , you only cheat youself

Come with me, take my hand
Help me to make a stand
I can't give in, cause my mind and my heart
Mind and heart bleed

Well, it's no surprise my friend
Another hero dies
What goes down comes back around, and it never
No, never lies

I didn't want to say that I was wrong

I don't have to act like I'm having fun 
Sitting here in the sun

In the jazz land I kept flashing to Angel Heart 
In the heat you'll watch the fans go round and round and round

It's not that I'm uneasy 
You know that I would never give up hope 
It's just the empty promises 
Of the main men I think I've had enough 
It's always the same 
It's never too easy

I never want to meet 'em like you

But at least you've got a heart 
To tell you what's wrong

It's not that someone's right or wrong

They don't want to find out that you're doing OK 
Will you be the first one when things get me down
Will you be the first one to bring me around
Resurrect my sense of believing
Cause' I sure could use the feeling
Got to get a handle, got to climb up another rung
I'm tired of being down, I don't want to drown
I'm gonna walk, gonna walk, like a walking time bomb
I don't want to go off, but I will if I'm forced to run
Will you be the first one when things get me down
Will you be the first one to bring me around
Resurrect my sense of believing
'Cause I sure could use the feeling
Something in the way I feel, makes me want to run
There's something in the way you lead me
That stop's my head from making my body go 
How about a sad song to make me get further down
Got to get ahead got to climb another rung
Will you be the first one when things get me down 
Will you be the first one to bring me around
Resurrect my sense of healing A Bm 'Cause I sure could use it 
Will you be the first one when things get me down
Will you be the first one to bring me around 
Resurrect my sense of believing
'Cause I sure could use the feeling",Sad Song

Don't give your faith to a stranger,
They just might take it when they leave and you won't have a leg to stand on,
They'll shatter everything that you believe.
Try not to forget where it started 'cause that's gonna be where it ends.

Look into my eyes to scorn me? 
Do I have to get down on my knees?

Well I know his son and I stole his daughter
I'd see him as I was driving past
He was always workin' on and workin' on and workin' on

An older man but not so old
Well he's lying in the ground now dead and cold
Well what's so hard is we're all confined
By the laws of something that's more divine

Anywhere and anyone, anytime and any reason
Everywhere and everyone has something going on
Anytime the sun don't shine or you're left behind or out of season
Constant changes moving on, shine over me

So I lost my sense of humour
I hope it's gonna find me sometime soon
Those times when you cannot be prepared
They suck the life right out of you

All you ask is to continue
But it leaves you spinning round and round
You don't need that pain within you
You've gotta wash it out, wash it out and kick it down

Anywhere and anyone, anytime or any reason
Everywhere and everyone has something going wrong
Anytime the sun don't shine or you're left behind or out of season
Constant changes moving on, shine over me

Well everywhere and everyone has many types of different reasons
Anytime that it all goes wrong just shine over me
Anytime you're left behind or the sun won't shine or you're out of
Season
Constant changes moving on, shine over me

Anywhere, anyone, anytime you care to mention
Everywhere and everyone has something going wrong
Anytime you're left behind and the heartache and the pain take over
Just stick around and shine over me

Doesn't look so bad with a voice beyond your head

Cracks in your walls greet me just like before
The cycle smiles on your face and in your hair
A different room we're in some other
Anything here that you see is in the wrong reality
Days within a glass cube

You gotta lose your way to find it
You don't think you can but you will

This will be all right for today
It's all right for today (repeat)

We're all round the table and I will slip behind
Broken hearted daydreams in back of all our minds
Welcome to reality it's not a realization
It's everlasting but I would go through
Anything here that you see is in the wrong reality
Days within a glass cube (repeat 2x)

You gotta lose your way to find it
You'll think you can't but you will

So why do you let yourself be treated like a piece of meat
A fucking piece of meat
You call it life I call it rape, I call it prostitution
I don'w know why you hate yourself
Cause you're not ugly at all
So let the sunshine in
And chase away your blues
Smilers never lose and frowners never win
So let the sunshine in
I know it's fucking hard
But now it's time to try and start to
Let the sunshine in
So when you feel fucked up like your life is in the gutter
Think about it for a minute
It's what you say that matters
Don't call it life, call it life, call it prostitution
And you won't have to hate yourself
Beacause you're a beautiful person",Sunshine

and I look the other way
I'm just going home I've had a long day
I'll leave you alone I'll stay out of your way
I'm just going home
is it the way I look or just cause I'm a man
it would be easier to take if I don't understand
why you need to worry
there's a lot of creeps out there
what can I say to show you that this time
you don't have to be scared
try to say something it's all I can do
to yell ""don't be afraid of me I'm not following you""

Were you lying all the time

Was it just a game to you

But I was wrong, but I was wrong

Screwball,"that's my word, I'm motherfucking stressed
It seems like life's tryin to put me through a test
'cause every fuckin day it's just gettin worse
what's worse? Might go out, die hard and end up in a hearse
But no time to think about the consequences
The years in jail, fuck the death sentence
All I know is that I need mad cash in a flash
Befo' I gotta kill somebody ass
Might as well be in jail or dead
'cause if you ain't gettin paid then you ain't gettin ahead (that's word nigga)
Sittin in my room with the lights out thinkin'
I'm alive, but I ain't livin, I'm leakin'
I made my bed and I'ma lay in it
But I ain't gonna stay in it
I might start sprayin shit
I should've stayed in school, but that's a dead issue
Fuck a G.E.D., that's like toilet tissue
All my friends are hoodlums and hustlers
Runnin with a bunch of stupid crazy motherfuckers
Niggaz fuckin their money up, niggaz gettin knocked
And jealous motherfuckers, they want the whole block
Though I could start flippin gettin on a mission

But I need much more, no time for bullshittin'
Niggaz listen...

The H-E-A-T- makes me crazy
I want to bust somethin, figures, touch somethin'
The heat is on, got a niggaz blood rushin'
I want to touch somethin, niggaz bust somethin'

Yo, all I know is guns, all I do is slug
I'd rather plug you with the heater than to have you front
My life revolves around the snub 4th
Stay gettin those outside of New York
Bullets from the cornerstone, I'm bringin home a arsen
Interstate 95 North to the Jackie Robinson
Watch out for D's in caprices in tauruses
Empire mistakes for cops, mad nervous
Back at home sell a few burners
Keep a miz and a seven mil for my personal
Walk with benevolence, holdin twin fifths
380's in the whip, a mini-eagle for my chick
That nigga P is sick, I need a silencer connect, see me
Niggaz be lyin, tellin stories, tell it walkin'
My nigga's into drugs and extortion
Knotty head for them niggaz on the nightshift pumpin'
The heat is on nigga....

[Chorus] - 6X",The Heat Is On
Screwball,"Chorus:

Life's full of love and hate
So we got crums to make
Survival's at stake
We under pressure
Still, we need to treasure
No exceptions, drastic measures
Its my life, no exceptions
Life's full of love and hate
So we got crums to make
Survival's at stake
We under pressure
Still, we need to treasure
No exceptions, drastic measures
You got one life, no exceptions

Now who ran guns with Bounty, did a joint with Rakim
A song with Mariah that had the whole world poppin
Who that be the are-A-Double P-E-are
Niggas fuck with this and they get sent to the E.R.
Now I'm rockin jams with the Screwball fam
They connected so thick, with them men in submission you know who ???
Screwball and the Mobb so sick
We repin' QB son, they wouldn't understand it
We roll so thick that niggas get Noyd
Niggas don't want it 'cause Noyd bring noise
No way, niggas can't stop me, son it shocked me 
They tried, I pulled out and popped three

Chorus

Hey yo
Light the blunts up, cook the coke up
One Times out, so what motherfucker I'm tryin to blow up
And when they show up I put the cracks in the stash
The gats in the grass, when they roll I just blast
With no problem bumpin Primo, to niggas we know
You try, you die like Peschi in Casino
No exceptions to the rule, the Ball to the Screw
Go back like ""check one two""
Street gang to the rap game
Worldwide thang, thugstyle niggas feel the pain
Gotta go hard and sunshine they rain
Blow the block up, fuck niggas, with no exceptions

I'm'a blow my steel, grab the chicken as a human sheild
Break elbows and wheel, no exception is the drill
Is it real, I'm cryin blunt retaliation
Follow ?wallet? for your information
4-1-1, scoop all we want dun-dun
Cash is the issue, while you blab about ya pistol
But you never blast a missile, ship your bagette pistol
Gettin scissors on they gun shot wound, you doomed
With no exception

Chorus

Yo, the streets baptised me to money and war
Gettin yours is a law that we never ignore
We score twice or more, keep it moving twenty-four
We seven days with no rest, still fresh looking
Our names inflamed with the smell of tongue cooking
The hoods rotten, we see the ??? from the crabs plottin
The sneak kill, sabatoge our deal
But we overlook it, 'cause our environment is crooked
And hard to finger who the D's got as a singer
Spillin the beans on the dealers and the fiends
So I move separate and conversate with the connections
On the low key, gettin this money with no exceptions

Chorus

Yeah that's right
We all Screwball up in here
No exceptions baby
My team go to any extreme to get the weight up
Streets don't stop, streets don't stop
No exceptions
Gotta get it, gotta get it
All in it to win it
y'all heard
Streets don't stop for nothin and nobody",No Exceptions
Screwball,"Yea (House of Hits) 
Finally up in this nigga 
On the real all you crab niggas know the deal 
On the real all you crab niggas know the deal 
To my seed May I lead you into no breed of evil 
In the categories and stories I breed my sequel 
You know the money blues blunts broken 22's 
Monkey see Monkey do 
A shorty sipping sunny dew 
Now its V.S.O.P. in a G.S. that's mad smokey 
Murder tree's, Crusin gun in the stash so it won't poke me 
Up in the Marriot, Sweet dirty tint, Don't make no noise cause we dirty 
Tell the ho's to hurry in 
We got the room lit up with perfume, and mad boom 
And there's video taping of booming ass's on the zooming lens 
Rolling on you non descript niggas 
Your marked for death like colombians with bad coke that gip niggas 
Tilt the dutch, twisting up the uwee if your skilled enough 
In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili's bust 

[Chorus] 
On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal 
On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal 2x 

Now its verbal abuse cause the mic's in use 
This is your sorry excuse 
Get your neck put in a noose 
K-L is quick to let loose, to make your blood count reduce 
Over the snare drum 
We reproduce like cum 
Impregnating the track, making it fatter than it was 
Giving life to idea 
Through the verse is what he does 

See a close call about two clicks from my fortress 
We rolling squad deep, on the Kawasaki hourses 
QueensBridge got the drop on you niggas trying to toss us 
We metal down now its time to show these clowns who the boss is 
We live for the shit, Ain't trying to take no lossess 
Accumalating to much cream for you to touch 
Fucking welcome to my clutches, wipe the blood on off my chuckers 
From the ruckus 
Your gone and your crew still love us 
Can't call it, I'm in love with this good life shit 
I'm working with jewels, car, chicken clits, paying rent 
Murdered Presidents, running wild, stacking in piles 
Onyx pendants, and Rubied down shit from the nile 
Kamikaze style, sought the antique three pound 
Yo Nas, lets cop this brick and let the mobb supply the town 

[Chorus: x2] 

(Play some treats on us) 
Drugs in my shirtsleeve 
The side bubble converti 
Eyes low cause the lye blow 
Five-oh know we dirty drive slow 
Write a line sipping a glass of wine 
The block is mine cause I am a live criminal mastermind 
When I rhyme, I perfect this, niceness, I'm blessed with 
Exhale precise shine like cocian white 
Its the life of Pablo, Escobar niggas I know 
With diamond rolexes, that drive infinite's and lexus 
So send my enimies a message 
My Tommy Hilfiger vest, is bullet proof, so when niggas shoot 
I'm still protected 
So never ask why I write so violent 
My brain storm formed on a dorm in Rikers Island 
I remained calm while you tried to bite my style and 
When I performed niggas mic's went silent 
To the kid who made my man ill will bless this 
(On the real) 
When I catch up to your ass you know the deal 

On the real

Screwball,"""Basically over, basically over, basically over""--Raekwon (Scratched my Primo)

The games over, feds took your Range Rover
Your man snitched and your girl's screaming ""I told ya""
About those over the shoulder boulders that you be having
Niggas smile in ya face, behind yo' back they back-stabbing
Laughing, talkin 'bout all ya business
How much you got to score with, to niggas you went to war with
How many guns you got, and where you go to cop
You shoulda seen me coming down the block
You was gettin hot, but you didn't give a fuck
You make a G in a day and spend it up
In a black Benz tinted up, pound of weed twist it up
Henny pourin out ya cup, livin it up
?Daddy Warbuck? style

Chours: repeat x2

I watched niggas rise, I watched niggas fall down (Fall down)
I seen it all, it went down in my town (Where, where?)
Called Queensbridge, where the fugitives live
Where some rap kids (Rap kids) can turn to big wigs (Big wigs)

My niggas rollin dice and fled
Braggin to the nigga with the slice in his head
Now there's a price on his head
For pullin out on Lil Bro
Flashin his heat, he askin for beef
Conference call, ready to brawl
Caught him on a Blaz'a 
He breathing hard like he got asthma
Choice words he spoke, headed for disaster
Last to the gramma I spit
Told him ""Fuck you and whoever you get""
He's like ""Whatever kid""
Fourteen days later
Whole team made they way to my block
Young bucks with guns tucked and cocked
Like they runnin the spot
I'm'a load one bullet for all of y'all
You saw it on my face, war ready
I'm callin the pace, its gettin more steady
Don't bite what you can't chew
Dumb little niggas like ""That ain't'choo""
Yo, recognize what it coulda came to
Put a whole in you, just like a navel

Chorus

Now keeps your eyes on
Screwball, these rap dons, QB  icons
Play the project with a firearm
Fully loaded, I keep a razor that's coroded
I'll slash you with it, 'cause every rhyme is crime committed
Speak it 'cause I did it before, I got on
I ?dub? niggas moms up til they first born
Til they only child, you pull car you'll get a wild
One, I'm at the bottom of the struggle tryin to rise son
A wise one, step ahead, keep my fam fed
Broke bread off this game and I held my head
You want details, then lets negotiate crack sales
New guns that's watched the game, clientale
Yo we rock well, we keep our name ringin bells
>From this mic to the street life, we doin this right
See we swore to these streets to vibe
And draw heat, fuck a peace sign
A waste of time, respect my nine

We'll decrease ya red blood cells if all else fails
Chop up your body send ya frame through the mail

Now where that tank when you still tote gats that ancient
Went from juvenile to a dope delinquent

Ay-yo who shot Rudy in broad daylight for cash?
I woke up this morning and hear the newsflash
They said it happened down at City Hall
He had his wife with I'm from the crowd made him fall
It was chaos and pandemonium blood covered up the podium
Covered his face, and wouldn't show me him
I had to see if it was true
Secret service was mad nervous, so was the boys in blue
Scatterin', like rats and ants, with the lights on
Man hunt the suspect all night long
Interrupted episodes, every channel show
Barricaded the city and blocked every road
Jakes in riot gear, blacks smilin' it is
Reporters cryin out in the street, ?""It ain't Rudy!""?
He ain't dead off, somebody blew his head off and skated out
Commissioner live on channel five when they announced his death
Wifey was stressed, she was right there
She stated: it was like a nightmare
One-time, was combing the streets, had the whole force on the beat
Flyin' in cars and on feet
The D's came through stompin'
Ghetto birds had the projects lookin' like Compton with marksmen
With dirty thirties out the window
I'm in my room smokin' boom, playin' Nintendo, high off the indo
Who shot Rudy?

[Chorus]
From courthouse to your house
Rich house to poor house
QB to Shaolin, Brooklyn Long Island
BX to Money Makin', YO and New Ro
The news final, yo, who shot Rudy?

They speculated it was mob related
Every wise guy with mafia ties, interrogated for lies
Every king and yeta, had the linguistics
Snatchin' they gats for ballistics and expert statistics
Were drawn out, gang unit was all worn out
Investigatin' his body and everybody else
Whoever gave threats, made bets or wages
Cash donators from the campaign stages
Cab drivers and frank vendors who protested
Were roughed up like Abner, gettin broom molested
Sharp lawyer suit-breasted, double-breasted reporters
Was mobbin' daughters and other mourners
Pushin' cameras away, blockin' the sights
Had the riot squad at Washington Heights
Kennedy Airport, stoppin' flights, niggaz was tight
Cause the couldn't sell a dime all night, but that was alright
The devil died and nobody cried
They was real like some Jews celebratin' when the pharaohe got killed
Glasses of Henny were spilled and we got twisted
Smokin' blunts on the corner like we used to cause we lived it
Knowin' he was gone for good ???, it got me thinkin'
Ay-yo, where the fuck Dinkens?
And Harlem World, Shaolin to Brownsville
Did Sharpton and Farrakhan make the shit real?
Was it Khalel? you know he keep mad steel
Did the Bloods or the Crips smoke Rudy on the hill

[Chorus]",Who Shot Rudy?
Screwball,"When the smoke clears
You know who gon' be there
When the smoke clear yo
That's all we got to tell y'all right now
Y'all know who gon' be standing there right

See its our destiny to count G's an' a semi-squeeze
Shoot the breeze, volley how the computers might freeze
So I'm'a store water, guns, can foods and keep order
We spaz out you cats prepare for the slaughter
The struggle savoir, got my temple on the border
Line, ready to corner you off and get ???, said it
Screwball, read the credit, get your whole team wetted (Yo)
You dealin' with some loose cannons (Yo) ready to dead shit

I heard the world was over ahit suppose to blow like supernova's (Uh huh)
I'm on the hill high off the real, pumpin' my bolos (Yeah)
Prediction told us turn into rollers, don't let the street control us (What happened)
'Cause when those crackers pull the plug they gonna creep the holders
I send my deacon donors, black re-bels, who kill de-vels
And move through cells we rule this hell (Screwball)
Make it picture perfect cock it back and lay it out
Bomb the White House run up in the pentagon and spray it out

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey, do all they talk about is Y2K (Y2Kayyy)
Hey hey hey, load it up and let the tech nine spray 
Hey hey hey, do all they talk about is Y2K (Y2Kayyy)
Hey hey hey, load it up and let the tech nine spray

How many times sour limes and coronas
Powerful crimes in America, corna' to corna'
What'choo want to do, cops huntin' you
Aimin' for the kill, layin' still
Permanent forever chill in heavens field
Spreadin' doin' deals, more electric than eels
Respectin' the reals, countin' what'choo build
Prepare was heal journey, with hard times
Examine it, playa's have money at random
Sittin' pretty, sayin' come and get me

Standin' in front of the gates of hell
Smackin' niggas, pullin' out the gat on niggas
Sold crack, plus I'm a rappin' nigga
I got rhymes for days, I got gats that blaze
Ready for motherfucking war
See this is whatcha'll wanted, you know it got to be me (Screw B)
Everybody talkin' 'bout they whips with the TV
I need some of this motherfucking rap money
I'm sick of this motherfuckin' funny crack money
Fuck all y'all bitch ass niggas, y'all don't worry me

Nas dropped Illmatic and let'cha'll faggots have it
He brought the shine back, made the right contact
Had the whole world sayin ""Hey dun, rewind that"" (Rewind that)
Niggas from every hood felt the new vibe
The word spread quick, the Bridge is still live
My dun went gold, then he went platinum
My niggas Mobb Deep had the streets right afta him
OH MY GOD, shits off the hook now
Killing kids, in the Bridge carry rap books now
Another chapter about to dominate
I guess its just in our nature, Queensbridge gotta set it straight
We on some kamikaze shit, moving at a Cormega pace
Infamous Mobb up in this rap race
This is the place where stars are born
I'm'a stay repin my hood until I'm'a dead and gone

You still walkin through life like you was blind
Need you a lucy but you short one dime
Damn, thought about it, ten minutes later
Bumbed a cigarette going up in the elavator

[MC Shan]
Dead dreams, more than sold
You gotta to try and receive ya goal
However you do it, however you may
Don't never listen to what nobody say, uhh
But you chose to lead that fate 
Now you're sucking on a bone when it should'a been steak (steak)
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goal
Stop walking through as you were blind
You should reach for your goal ''cause I'm reaching for mine
You love to, you love to

Smacked the bitches with a bag of phillies

Hook 3:

Aiyyo, we zoned out, in New York we boned out

We goin out (How we go out?)
The cash route, the weed ain't free but the pussy on the house

Hook 1, with Variations in background

If I say jump chick you ask ""How high?""
'cause I can meet a senorita on the prowl or not
Its foul, but take a lie
Every kiss is like medicine to hear you whine
I'm pullin off with benjamins
Don't be dancin on the brass bed
Anotha bumb in the closet
or are you stitchin with a fat head
I can't front though, trump tight, rump was right yo
??? gave me clostrophobia from this tight hole
Blowin up the taste buds with milk duds
Flinchin like a snitch when my dick does
You know you was, two chicks on my dick
Two birds with one stone
And a love song with ???
Straight up, my man's telling me

Hook 3

Hook 1, with variations

We got the 'dro and the henny low
Bunch'a freaks lettin go
In the limo jettin on the grand centro'
Tryin to guess the plane, gettin brain
Its all in the game
Screwball, we entertain niggas
Same niggas, thugged out with the hoes
So we could all jump off, bag somemo' at the next show
Honies love my stee-lo, I dig egos
Any dick up on the first night, feed 'em forced info
Then breeze on 'em yo

We pumpin rap at'choo

Been hard since I came up to ya job to snatch ya

Screwball,"Players keep playin', haters keep hatin'
So much to say, so little time
For the hood that I pray
Haters I spit you die; slow; die; slow

Wash my hands in some in-scent smoke
Pull a leaf off a tree
Flip it over nothing innocent though
City split it over to me
Hennessey spilling over tenements of QB
It's real or more a day
Plenty of ways to die
Plenty of ways to survive
Plenty of ways gettin' high
Straight sip the innocent kind
And the rest unjustified with an alibi, normal racquets
Undercovers with heat in their slumber jackets
Government badges and colored stripe brackets
G's sittin' pretty like cash and (???)
Witty thugs play out; I obey the writer Ala
Swaying in and out, above and beyond
The humidity, really got me jittery
Cold like a barrel of ice
Dark shadows of life
I put my head on a pillow, di-do-do-ditto
What son say, you still know
I catch a chill flowing through my temple
It's real simple
Good faith, common sense, six-triple in the mix
Dippin' through quick aiming to get you; it's the click!

[Chorus]
For the thuns, each one to each one son
Street life is all I know
Ways to move I pay dues; I'm talking to all of you
Warfare is when you go
For the cash ''cause I reach for them... reach for them
Street life is all I know
Full bellies and cellis, close enemies to siece memories
Warfare is when you go

Yo..It's Hostyle ¿que pasa?
No masa; tu eres no problema
¿Cliente hah?
Drama with dada is dangerous
Bang with anguish; Flame with a touch
Deranged ain't enough
Gunpowder laying on my cuff
Call my bluff   
The streets don't stop; it's like a marry-go-round
The beats don't stop; multiply various rounds
Of hard knock, bar locked gates
These are the brakes
Family ties without a trace
Old G's ? With sheets of casper toke
Premeditated plans later dated
Haters waited with iron plated heat
Designed, made miraculously dated in deep memory
So...keep countin' dollars
Keep mine moving scholars of rap
With a lot of gats; holla' back!

[Chorus]

You'll win by all means
Struggle for the cream
Hustle by ways of being
Don't let prophecy end
Don't let the Po-Po knock me again
Don't let the 'nine' cock freely in sin
Missiles through your flesh tissue... military issue
Guess you understand the risk you take
Dissed you on your forehead snake
More dead weight
Pitch fork love; It's for coke thugs
Bitches huffin' & puffin'; huffin' & puffin' about nothin'
Watch you say I hold against you in the court of law
Gun firing; wall to wall
? closed from burn holes
Fires turned on my stone... Fuck That!
'Cause I gotta eat; pockets so swolled
From reasons of livin'
The breath I'm givin'
All the checks I'm scribblin'; it's real baby!

And still survive the bust shots
Spit flames; Niggaz gettin' slaughtered in flames

I come through you town and let murder rain
Acid from the planes

I'll leave you on the corner with your fuckin' brains out
Creep up on you were you love to hang out

Seep through doorways... cracks and crevices
My gage just die from lack of
How many niggaz that you know that can mop a D?
Know we dead ass won't, won't, won't, cop the pleat
But then you never met a nigga that's as cocky as me
Pull a flame, throw it out, make 'em drop and then freeze
Let 'em know I ain't playing; pop one in his knee
Have his team and cops come gunning for me
Have gat men coming; have 'em running from me
Where them missiles come from?

I'm that gangsta nigga; pop slugs in your wick
I'm that gangsta nigga; said fuck what you did
I'm that gangsta nigga your bitch want to be with
New gel like hair grease
Just leave it on a small piece
But the picture's bigger than you
I'm living from Screw, Lou!
Open the gates 'cause I'm sending 'em through
I got the semi and the Henny and a mob that smash
All you over night thug niggaz just won't last
Got enough thuns and gun that'll come and blast
We could duck on you bitch ass niggaz and keep our freedom
Murk you on the low and tell your click when we see 'em
Fuck y'all, kiss our ass, we got cash now!

My time is rare, take time, time to prepare
No time for fear, how many times I said it this year?
At what time ya going to realize that time is near?

Call a time out, Scritti Politti, major climb down
The cracks of the streets waste no time on beats
Mos' Def, most definitely the rap chief
The new release, time to make cream, time to take a piece

And at the same time, time to rebuild, time is rilla
I swear I bring the heat, the tracks to Val Kilmer
You know that time waits for no man, in time you'll see
That you're wasting all you time while you're watching TV

From where I'm sitting now, got a whole clearer vision now

I played the tables hard, wild cards I was flipping now
My partners hittin' pounds, somewhere up in prison now
I'm flippin' high, things switch and change so suddenly
The way you act today is tomorrow's where you wanna be

You company shifts when you start livin' comfortably
Spotlights switch and then you dip right from under me
Don't front for me, I want to be perfectly clear
Time is here, I'm keepin' yesterday in the rear

A current affair, Mos' Def and Lee Majors appear

Flash awards, cash cards, time's a double-edged sword
One day you hear applause, next day when you leave
You catch a L in the see like Christopher Reeves

Do you all believe that these cats threw dirt on my name?
Give 'em time, they couldn't win if I gave 'em point game
At times I used to swerve, now I'm learning my lane
Trapped in time, what a shame with nobody to blame

I waits for no one and fat and slow ones, the rich no funs
The Samurai's and Shoguns, the first stringer no runs
Ayyo gun, you'd better hope to it or you blow, son

Bring me some pollywogs home in a jar

By British home stores just sitting outside
Looking self satisfied
But the point was beside

Down at the shore, some Friday in June
Washed in on the tide, lit up by the moon
She'll find a part as she walks in her sleep
A piece of the reason dragged up from the deep

Small paper packages washed down with gin

Let it settle in this place

All prophecy will fail
And by that light we'll sail

Well, I've seen the end of the men of means
And so I want that thrill and then
You know I want that thrill again

And why everything came apart

You will never need to doubt me

I would never let you come to harm

Seen the dark clouds coming in

Sure I've got the sense to make a record of my own undoing
I should like to mention, a friend or some relation

I go back from time to time to indeces and empty schools
All now are dull sublime, all were then my golden rules
But you know I'm lying, I'm just sick and tired of trying
You could throw a party and maybe I'll be there

Get me out of here
Let me show you my arms

I prefer the water's edge, seven locks and three cliffs bay
No allegiance left to pledge more than that I could say
I was never better, life before the letter
They can throw me comfort crumbs but they can't bake the cake

And longed for the touch of a breeze
Stroking her skin with true lovers fingers
From Parliament Hill down to Greenwich it lingers

For seconds in a small moonlit room
She remembers how love feels for you

The days of the Crow Valley sweetheart
They mean something to someone I'm sure
Long, long ago in fairwater nowhere
He told her so much that it hurts him to go there

For fear that his future is sealed
Back there where the first breeze was born

It was the first big hit of its kind in the pop charts
All that last shit with profit in mind, not heart

Prancing about like they're the next big thing

There a vessel through which a higher power's conveying
""my lyrical content is a miracle, godsent""
My name is scroobius pip and I say fuck all that nonsense

Their lyrical prognosis is like spirital osmosis
In that everything they say evaporates into boasts, its a joke
Ive listened and I cant even find one quote which is
Worth using as a reference or even as a footnote

Scroobius Pip,"Hey There, how, how's it going?
Long time no see.
I know I haven't been around much lately
But, it didn't seem like you wanted me to be
The last time I sent down a message you nailed it to the cross
So I figured I'd just leave you to it, let you be your own boss

But I've been keeping an eye on you, I have, 
And it's amazing how you've grown.
With your technological advances and the problems you've overthrown, 
And all the beautiful art you've created with such grace and such finesse, 
But I admit there are a few things I'm afraid have impressed me less.

So I'm writing to apologize for all the horrors committed in my name, 
Although that was never what I intended, 
I feel I should take my share of the blame.
All the good I tried to do was corrupted
When organised religion got into full swing, 
What I thought were quite clear messages were taken to unusual extremes.
My teachings taken out of context to meet the agendas of others, 
Interpretations taken to many different ways and hidden meanings discovered

Religion became a tool, for the weak to control the strong
With all these new morals and ethics, survival of the fittest was gone
No longer could the biggest man simply take whatever he needed
'Cause damnation was the price if certain rules were not heeded
Some of the deeds committed in my name
Just made me wonder were I went wrong.
Back at the start when I created this, the foundation seemed so strong.
See all the elements were already here, long before I began, 
I just kind of put it all together
I didn't really think out a long-term plan.

I made the sun an appropriate distance and laid the stars across the sky
So you could navigate the globe or simply watch the sun rise
I covered the earth with plants and fruits, 
Some for sustenance and some for beauty
I made the sun shine and the clouds rain
So their maintenance wasn't your duty
I tried to give each creature it's own attributes
Without making them enveloped
I gave you all you all your own space to
Grow and in your own way space to develop

I didn't know such development would cause rifts and jealousy
Cause you to war against each other and leave marks on this planet indelibly
You see, I wasn't really the creater, I was just the curator of nature
I want to get something straight with homosexuals right now, I don't hate ya
I was a simple being that happened to be the first to wield such powers
I just laid the ground, it was You that built the towers

It was You that invented bombs, and the fear that comes with them
And it was You that invented money, and the corrupt economic systems
You invented terms like just-war and terms like friendly fire
And it was You that didn't know
When to stop digging deeper, when to stop building higher
It was You that exhausted the resources I carefully laid out on this earth,
And it was You that even saw these
Problems coming but accredited them little worth
It was You that used my teachings for your own personal gain
And it was You that committed such tragedies, 
Even though they were in my name

So I apologize for any mistakes I made, and when my words misconstrued
But this apology's to mother nature, cause I created you",Letter from God to Man

Scythian,"The devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you 

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

He played Fire on the Mountain run boys, run
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in a bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No child, no

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back
If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been""

Einen für den Euro, wegen dir ist Deutschland pleite

Einen Oli Pocher, einen Boris Becker

Einer geht an jeden Rapper, der Frauen schlagen muss

aber deine Kumpels haben nur mit dem Handy gefilmt

Ja bei dir hilft nur Gewalt 
Und dann vergrabe ich dich im Wald

Gewalt ist falsch nur das wir uns nicht falsch verstehen 
Ist auch keine Lösung sonder meistens das Problem 
Doch ich gucke nicht zu wenn einer unten liegt und blutet 
Denn dieses einemal ist Gewalt vielleicht was gutes 
Die Leute haben recht wenn sie raten sei kein Held 
Doch wenn du einen Menschen rettest, rettest du die Welt 
Mit Karate 
Denn manchmal hilft kein nettes reden 
Schade 
Typen wie dich muss man treten 
Ich habe es auf Englisch,Deutsch und Latein probiert 
auch mit Zeichensprache,Bilder malen du hast es nie Kapiert

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk

Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone

Sea Wolf,"Good Morning Dear
I hope I didn't wake you too soon
Because my mind is growing tired
Too much thinking what I should do
I picture you out there
It must be beautiful this time of year
All those East Coast leaves
Floating round like embers from burning trees
Well the weather out here is just the same
But the garden that you planted remains.

Now it's only work
Each day bleeding into the next
Barely scraping by I tire myself out just so I can rest
But rest it rarely comes
And when it does I cannot go home
Because it's much too quiet
Seems that I'm not suited to being in love
And everyone around me's changed
But the garden that you planted remains.

I think about you
Maybe more than I should
But the smog is getting old
The drugs I'm taking aren't so good
So will you talk to me
Even though you've had a late night
Because I need a little help
Baby, tell me I'll be alright
Cause everything around me's changed
But the garden that you planted remains",The Garden That You Planted
Sea Wolf,"Every time I come back home
I get this feeling I'm alone
Yet all the streets are all the same
And all my friends still know my name

I wonder when I'm at my door
Will this key work anymore
Does someone else now live inside

I think before returning died
I don't know if I'll be back this time
Sometimes I wish that it were cold
And I had someone warm to hold
To watch the clouds move through the skies

To keep my feelings occupied
I'd never thought I'd want to leave
I thought I had all that I need
Yet my apartment feels so small
When I come home and no one's called

I don't know if I'll be back this time
I don't know if I'll be back this time
I might just stay here with you",I Don't Know If I'll Be Back This Time
Sea Wolf,"Well I woke up this morning 
And I made a resolution, 
I said ""never going to sing another sad song again.""

I decided I'd admit it, 
I'm not an intellectual, 
Though the words never come easy unless I'm singing them, 
And the hills that I was born in will never leave me 
No matter how hard I try.

And then my brother was murdered 
While my father was in prison, 
And the girl that I sometimes loved up and moved away, 
And my body filled up with blackness, 
And the darkness it wanted to drown me, 
And I heard my father's footsteps catching up to me, 
And he took me by the shoulders 
And he said ""son, my hands are strong, 
But I hope you have the strength to shake us free, 
Shake us free boy, shake us free my son, you better shake us free.""

And now I'm lying in the van,
Chicago in the springtime,
And the rain outside was falling sounds just like popcorn,
But before I open my eyes I think I make this resolution, 
""no I'm never gonna sing another sad song for as long as I live""

And the light coming through the windows is making everything glow
And he took me by the shoulders 
And he said ""son my hands are strong, 
But I hope you have the strength to shake us free, 
Shake us free, shake us free, shake us free my son.""

Sea Wolf,"I met a girl on Halloween
When she was lost, and I was drunk
And it was dark and cold out when we left

And as we walked the rain started
The leaves softened with every step
And all around us people slept alone with their dreams

The wind came down from up the planes
And blew the leaves all through the streets
I wondered how far leaves could really fly

Would they rest in suburb yards
Or make it to the city
Or would they end up in the river just to float away

She pointed to a small brick house
And said it was where she grew up
The lights were out, she asked if we could stop for awhile

Her hair was still just getting wet
The water running down her neck
Collecting in the hand print in cement beneath her feet

Apparently there'd been a death
Someone close and nothing left
Because she hadn't left him in the end

I saw her blush when I asked
If she always talked like that
She said it only happened when she drank

And later on I felt her hand
Slipping into my cold fist
She promised me a kiss as soon as we got home

Her costume had begun to tear
She ran ahead and turned to me
Her laughter echoed through the empty streets",Leaves in the River

And its stamina that I lack

So won't you run to me tonight?
Tonight could turn but we're just lovers
But I'll only ever be a middle distance runner

Well my heart is beating hard
And I'm off with a shot at the start
And my legs tremble from strain
But by the finish line I'll drain

So won't you run to me tonight?
Tonight let's not talk about next summer
Cause I'll only ever be a middle distance runner

Well I'm so proud tonight
Of the woman you've become
And I'm just too tired to fight

Warm and steady as she rests.

Lulling me to sleep.

Light from a source unseen reflected
By the moon on rocks collected
Near our bodies unexpected
Pulls us from out dreams.

And touched the branches in my cold white fever

Young and free along the river rapids

Drunken nights
The sun stayed up like
A diamond in the sky

I woke up
Where have you been?
I know I'm bored
And my blood is pretty thin

But some nights I swear
There was magic in the air
A fox invites me to part from loneliness
Wolves seem to pick a scent of an owl in my head

Your head's in headlock
You in trouble again?
Now you've lost
Another friend

You felt something
But you're never feeling loved

What things looked like when you were young?
The voice of an old friend
Or the notes to your first song

It's been a while now
Since you asked me to be
Your cat, your dog
Your owl or bumblebee

Lately I've been feeling
Like the day?s gonna come
You'll walk up to me
And erase my memory

Can't wait to feel brand new
I can't wait to meet you again, friend

I think I must have known you
In another life
I think our rocking chairs
Used to rock together all night

With pictures of owls
All over the walls
Tiny ships in bottles
They won't sail too far out

Seabear,"We spread our blankets over the lake
I [Incomprehensible]
I tried to leave but he held my arms
And head in the lake

So I grab on hold to the spider's neck
And ride out of town
?Cause I'm sick and the days are long
I tried and I tried

To squeeze the blue out of the sky
The yellow out of the sun

In that big invisible moment
The kid on my shoulders
With the time we'll make it into sand
Agreed, he took in your hand

Like a rabbit in a human skin coat
He'll dance on the yard
Like a wolf flipping goodbye notes
You'll howl at the sky

So show your cat teeth to the light
And grab into his main vein

Seabear,"Fall down the stairs
It's been a long time since
I got my hands on your teenage poems
It's the only poison that I like

I'm throwing rocks
At broken windows
Picking locks
With footprints from the snow

And I don't believe you live in a library
That sails the sea
Sleeping with a book-blanket out at sea
Like you told me

My little bird
Flew away from me
She made her home
In a poor country

You're breaking branches
On your way down
Just someone new
To throw your arms around

The next time I wake up
I want to be
In a rabbit hole
To the sound of you making coffee

With the warm
Salty sea
It?s waves
Crashing over me

Look what you've done
You punched a hole in the sun
Look what you've done
You punched a hole in the sun

Look what you've done
You punched a hole in the sun
And now it won't shine
For anyone

When you're not sleeping
It?s hard to make it mean something
When it means nothing at all

Hear a call he made
I slept for a year until
I pulled your hair

I fell down the stairs
So glad I found you there
Time to forget
Your mistakes and regrets

Sometimes I swore
You're in my house
Was a trap too

And I had black nights
When my hope had died
You, you're a friendly knife

So I let the werewolf out
I let the [Incomprehensible] have their way
I've looked down on you
From my mountain, I slept by your feet

And when you come out
With your strong winter moon to drown in sound
And I?ll sleep nor lie
When your happy tide twist ashore on the frozen ground
It?s your hollow now so many would dream about

Some nights I swear
There was magic in the air

Pack ya down in the earth, we put work in like Mad Dirt
Odainers twistin like the revolver or the earth
Fuck church, it's a must I burst and curse
Yeah I'm a West Coast Bad Boy but a thousand times worst
Dime piece, gun in her purse, one in her skirt
Cross me, bet ya life that my bitch burst
Got me lockin down the world for the North Pole
Too cold to hold lyrics froze my wrist and my hoes
Number one Thug Lord, fuck wit us!
I won't lie the whole world gonna rush wit us, tell em

Mug in me and get yo fro pushed back like homie
You lil clown ass nigga walkin in bozo shoes
While my niggas out here doin hits, makin the news
What you think you gon' dodge these bullets like Matrix?
Like a condom, I even lay teck on a bitch
Now that's some cold shit, a low lick, a cold hit
Leave a nigga at a funeral cryin with no bitch
Some Thug Lord shit nigga shoot up ya coffin
Niggas cross game get murdered by bosses
Cost's yo mutha fuckin life when you play with the rules
They got a n-uh-nigga still singin the blues

Bitch, next up to bat, Yukmouth destroy the earth with rap
Imagine pain worse than that, my niggas coppin birds of crack

I want my turf back, I hurt that, work that, twerk that
Rolex speed spot like Joe Pesci
AK ready, we deadly, bitch!
I'm like Hannibal, rector eat MC's for breakfast
I'm the hardest artist to sign to a label in Texas
Yes it's that nigga with the platinum grill full of princesses
Invisible set, straight up herbal molescents
In less than 60 seconds I kill em leavin em breathless
Don't fuck with bread, run outta state bit records
With chin checkers in Benz stretches who win cheddar
When fakers scramble liquid hands on niggas with vindettas
I'm like 10 fraredders bustin off at the same time
Payed rhymes, I kick shit off when it's game time

I'm hittin niggas so hard with these you would need Jesus

That's why I'm fuckin you with the 9 millimeter
And I feed a nigga with the heater, he was a long bleeder
And he taste good with fajitas, heat em up now eat
Member me? Nigga that be eatin raw meat
With tiger claw feet so it's easy to creep
You leave me no reason but to leave niggas bleedin
receive grievence with extra Season of the Sicc
I pick em off like Brock Marion
He kept starin so I took care of him, shot him up with heroin
Like malt liqour, to the liver hitter, to the river wit ya
Dip ya down deep, down deep
Where pirana heat they eat they meat
Heat up they seats, they seats with metal from the Southside ghetto
I swear I'll make why'all mutha fuckas yellow
Tired of diggin ditches like the GoodFellows
Not good with mellow, I keep the meat
Keep it hangin in the closet like pig feet

[VERSE 1: Seagram]
Spent 75 on some cakes
Straight raw, 2.2 was each weight
And fuck the law, niggas on my beeper wanna get hooked up
The colas in the beaker with the soda gettin cooked up
It's all about makin g's, I'm the man
27 in the oz's, the bag weighs a gramm
Walk a tight rope cause the feds is watchin me
Cause I'm slingin mo' dope than a pharmacy
I got it on wholesale, takeover's the target
Straight snow sale, nigga, floodin the market
And I can give a fuck, nigga, if you wanna tussle
Jealous of my figures, you're best to check your hustle
We can get down if you run up
I'm from the Town where niggas get down from sun down to sun up
Gotta watch my back, niggas creepin in the strike zone
Always got my gat, they got me sleepin with my Nikes on

[CHORUS: Seagram (2X)]
Every day and night
Livin in the life
They got me sleepin in my Nikes
It's do or die against my rivals
I could give a fuck cause it's all about survival

[VERSE 2: Scarface]
Fuck it, I'm high, mentally stuck, do or die
Who the fuck am I? A young killer on the rise
Look in my eyes, you see the vision of a nigga feelin trapped in his inner self
It's fuckin with my mental health
Born in the city where the niggas die young
Mist-covered street corners collapsed where I slung
And everybody standin stiff waitin on the cake
I'm waitin on a muthafuckin break, ain't no escape
Make no mistakes and leave a muthafucka breathin
They all got to die this evening, cause I believe in
You kill a muthafucka 'fore a nigga come through
With his crew makin your nightmares come true
Now who gon' be the first to die cause I'd extinguished your whole click
Gimme the money, nigga, no shit
I'm in your spot with a Glock, down to bomb
On any nigga needin bomb, sleep with your muthafuckin Nikes on

[CHORUS: Seagram]

[VERSE 3: Seagram]
Gots to watch these pirates tryin to get my treasure
I don't know why it's, but police pressure
Got me feelin like a zero, mayn, no good
But I'm knowin I'm a hero, mayn, in my hood
Now I'm havin dreams of firin at them lames
I used to have dreams of retirin from the game
Now as fast as I got it, I'ma lose it
See, the cash and narcotics made me ruthless
Timer know the real, they heard the situation
'bout the drama in the Ville, I'm 3rd generation
Now they wanna put a jacket on my risen hustle
Cause I couldn't hack it livin in the struggle
Now I live every minute like my last one
Labelled a menace and a threat, and I'ma blast em
Seldom I can smile when the lights is on
And if you're livin like me, you better sleep with your Nikes on

[CHORUS: Seagram]

Yeah, uknowmsayin
Keep your muthafuckin eyes focused, mayn
On this muthafuckin game out here
Uknowmsayin, cause it ain't no joke, mayn
Uknowmsayin, cause you never plan to fail
You fail the plan
You feel what I'm sayin?
So keep it real, mayn
And keep your eyes open for these busters
And these snake-ass niggas, uknowmsayin?
Falsely advertisin as a muthafuckin homeboy, uknowmsayin?
These niggas gon' get they muthafuckin character assassinated out here

Pink blue eyes drink in the aftermath

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grey

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
Baby, to me, you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen?

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah

I've been kissed by a rose on the grey
I've been kissed by a rose on the grey
And if I should fall, will it all go away?

We were older then,
And we lived a life without any doubt.

Of friends I had before.
And I wonder why.
The ones who care don't call anymore.

But you know I overcome the pain.

There can't be a fire unless there's a flame.

And put on your peace wires for a day

Heavenly, trust in me

I see a miracle place to be
Why is it anyone has to die?
Did they ever ask you why?

When will you talk about being free?
Pain isn't all that it's meant to be
Hanging another one out to dry
Is there any reason why?

Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, a man's, a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a little baby girls and a baby boys
Man makes then happy 'cause man makes them toys
And after man has made everything, everything he can
You know that man makes money to buy from other man

Girl, don't fail to get your learnin'. 
Boy, don't fail to see the light.
See the light. Don't fail, don't fail, don't fail.

Why do leaves blow in the summer wind, torn from their end. 
Where have I been?
Why do times learn from certain times, and nothing is for sure.
Only pure uninterrupted acts prevail. 
Don't fail.

Seals & Crofts,"She's not just another girl, she is from another world.
Bringing tidings of love and joy, not to just another boy.
She has got an angel's face, she is in, not out of place.
In this winter she was spring. Mom, you're not a passing thing.

Ce n'est pas une fille quelconque, elle arrive d'un otre monde.
Apportant la belle saison, amour et joi a ce garcon.

Seals & Crofts,"Lookin' up the sleeve of confidence, I jump down from the fence.
Been a long time since I've felt this way, let the feeling stay.
Reaching for the arms of love, livin', dreamin', thinkin' of
The moment I slip on the glove, my fear is gone. 
The grain of hope has grown.

Starin' at the face of happiness, this time it answers yes.
In aging peace my doubts will rest away, let the feeling stay.
Looking through the eyes of truth, I see faith and love and youth.
And all else dries up like the dew, my fear is gone. 
The grain of hope has grown.

And I'll be running, laughing, playing in the sweet green fields of belonging to someone.

The distant feeling's gone, and I can make it from now on.
My world has something new. 
It's all because of you.
The sweet green fields growing in my life will never die.

Lookin' up the sleeve of confidence, I jump down from the fence.
Been a long time since I've felt this way, let the feeling stay.
Walking up the road of togetherness, this time I must confess
This day's the very best. 
My fear is gone. 
The grain of hope has grown.

And I'll be running, laughing, playing in the sweet green fields of belonging to someone.
Now I'll be running, laughing, playing in the sweet green fields of belonging to someone.

Seals & Crofts,"Love conquers all, so the story is told.
True love doesn't get old, it gets stronger.
Love conquers all, that's not hard to believe.
If you find it naive, still believe it when you try.

Take an empty heart, fill it up with love, offer it to someone new.
Women make it strong, have them pass it on, let them have as much as you.
Love is what you make it, how you give and take it.
First time out, just fake it. You don't have to be taught.

Love conquers all, takes the best from the worst.
Nice guys comin' in first all around us.
Love conquers all, and the love's [law's?] not easy to hide.
If you let it outside, it will bounce right back to you.

Take an empty heart, fill it up with love, it will leave you in a living dream.
Love can make you drown, you can never tell all the things love can give.
Love is what you make it, how you give and take it.
First time out, just fake it. You don't have to be taught.

Love conquers all, be it strong and full of seed.
Take as much as you need, you deserve it.

It's love that carried the wagons. Love's what happened to dragons.

Yes love can handle the pieces that fall.

Seals & Crofts,"You talk of love in endless riddles, the truth is bent to fit your teeth
Your ears hear only necessary words and thoughts that make you breathe
From out of the depths of want you wander, searching for familiar sound
Of some unsuspecting sorrow, on his way to not be found
Like a ravel gone unnoticed, 'til the cloth begins to tear
One small grain of salt in water, at first is not so hard to bear
Out of an hour or day you're born to play your harp and wear your gown
Hiding, waiting, for the right one on his way to not be found. Not be found
Should our paths cross each other I'll keep my eyes fixed on the ground
I'll keep right on walking past you, rather than to not be found. Not be found, not be found
To fill one's pipe with dreams of amber, to taste the smoke is ecstasy
But the one who claims the clouds won't let you know serenity

Await their chance to take the stranger to the land of not be found

(And you're sick of what you're dealing with)

Here's a song to show you that I'm feeling
If I had you here, you know what I'd give you
The next time he hurt you bad, baby
Let me make it all okay

First I'ma come and get you good
(Out the hood, from no fear)
Don't wanna let me pull my gun
(But if I have to I will)

For two days straight Ima keep you up
(Make you feel like you ain't felt)
In my bed, hitting it like he didn't hit it bad

I know you on fire and ya man don't fuck you right
Damn, my side is cold, just come on in
I know you about it, your gonna get your chance to show tonight
Stress no more, just come on in
Stress no more, just come on in

It must be hard to spend every night and get no love
Only affection that you getting is when he hits on ya
Probably beaten but he won't be puttin' fists on ya
Girl, let me get a little aggressive, but it's gonna be good

Here's a song to show you all that I'm feeling

'Cause the one you're dealing with is really getting old
(So gettin' old)

You know I've got that brand new
Do more than ya man do
Go on and grab some chocolate before the money close
Showing you my lady, showing you're my baby

Now raise your hands up
Ohh, I forgot that way too heavy
Man, I've got to get it
And rock you steady

Better keep my baby close to my hip like a machete
I wouldn't be here for you if I didn't care
Wanna do what I do with you, shawty, and pull your hair
Is that too rough, put you in handcuffs, gotta change
You'll never be nowhere but in my care

Sean Garrett,"One last gaze upon the sun
Bid farewell to everyone
Kicked that bucket out the door
Where I'm goin' I won't need it anymore

Gonna lay my burden down
Take a bird's eye look around
From the tall pines of Carolina
All the way to the Wall of China

So I go sailing 'round the room
Through my window, cross the silver moon
No flesh and bone to hold me
I'll finally set my soul free
When I go sailing 'round the room

Life may be just but a dream
Rode my boat on down the stream
To wake up on a different shore
Wind up as something I ain't never been before

I could be a drop of summer rain
Fallin' down on an Oklahoma plain
Gonna leave the world behind me
Look around and you will find me

So I go sailing 'round the room
Through my window, cross the silver moon
No flesh and bone to hold me
I'll finally set my soul free
When I go sailing 'round the room

(I will be)
In the smoke from Mauna Loa
Morning mist on the Shenandoah

(I will be)
Grain of sand in the Kalahari
Magnolia by the Mississippi

(I will be)
Bird song when the day is breaking
Words of love when your heart is aching

Blue bonnet by the highway
I'll be everywhere and always

When I go sailing 'round the room
Through my window, cross the silver moon
No flesh and bone to hold me
I'll finally set my soul free

When I go sailing 'round the room
Through my window, cross the silver moon
No flesh and bone to hold me
I'll finally set my soul free

Everyday I saw you there chilling on the corner
Puffing on crack and Marijuana
Because I know how your life is
Nobody just be guiding, no

Hope to see black people living longer
Also less kids without fathers
We should all come together
Please stop fighting and killing each other

It's so dark and you don't get sunlight
People seeing why you don't get treated right
But I'm a try to change it

Many people living off welfare
Hoping things get better next year
But I'm covered in tears
So many sick without health care

Too many innocent people dying
And I don't know why
You gotta keep your eyes open even when your rolling
As days go by

It's what happens when your living in the street life
It's so dark and you don't get sunlight
People seeing why you don't get treated right
But I'm a try to change it

[Chorus]

Somebody change the world
We've got little boys and little girls
Growing up on this sinful earth
Oh whats happening?

I don't know, but please tell me
We've got all these criminals and discretes
Killing people for no reason
I don't know why

I know we've been through hard times and the struggles
And I just wanna tell you I love you

Only fifteen put under pressure
First month 27th day
They took away my mother
I was left to be raised by my brother

Taught to be a hustler
Mommy gone gotta stick together
Stay strong through the stormy weather
Became a top seller, look how we stacking this cheddar
When you jump mommy life would be better
Just like Rihanna you can stand under my umbrella

You know how to make me better
Even when we lose our cheddar
Even through the stormy weather
You hold me down

Mommy just dry your eyes, mommy don't you cry
I know we've been through hard times and the struggles
And I just wanna tell you I love you
(x2)

Seventeen got a little money
Feeling kinda blue
Cause it's looking you doing 10 to 20
Riding being broke ain't funny

It's all being hungry
But I'm a keep hustling for my mommy
Until I get rich like puffy
Never had a blamby

You said I can be all I can be
Some day I'm a buy you Miami
So when I win my Grammy
You coming cause I do this for my family

You know how to make me better
Even when we lose our cheddar
Even through the stormy weather
You hold me down

Seventeen now my mommy's gone
Can't wait till she come back home
Missing her face like dust till dawn, while she went away
Never think it be this long

I feel like crying while I'm writing this song
Can't wait till that day come on
When she leave the place

Hey whats up mom, how you doing?
It's been about 2 years since I saw your face
I miss you like crazy
Know the money orders the pre paid costs

Being on my own
No Knee Kurt Canino
But I love you though
This for you

You know how to make me better
Even when we lose our cheddar
Even through the stormy weather
You hold me down",Dry Your Eyes

But this situation is kinda weird
I like her sister

I was just walking out school
I saw this girl getting off the train
We exchanged numbers and went on a couple dates
At first everything was cool
Until I meet her sister Lauren
Got introduced to each other and then everything changed

I wanted a piece of that forbidden fruit
But my homies said to stay away
But I'm 17 what you expect me to do
I guess we'll charge it as a part of the game

[Chorus x2]
If I'm wrong oh I don't want to be right
I kissed your sister last night
It ain't my fault
I guess your sister's my type

Now I'm on the telephone talking
With Lauren but her sisters on the other line
But I can't help my self cuz Lauren too fine
And I know this may be wrong but it feels so right
Her sister is nice but Lauren is more like sugar and spice

I wanted a piece of that forbidden fruit
But my homies said to stay away
But I'm 17 what you expect me to do
I guess we'll charge it as a part of the game

Sorry that it had to go like this way
But you know your sisters got what I need
Cuz I got to be with Lauren

But you're the star tonight so wind it for me
Wind it for me, wind your pretty body for me

Oh girl, the way you move is magical so please don't ever stop
We know the club is closing
But forget about clock, keep windin' for me
Wind it for me, I'm trying to show you off
So baby, just follow my lead

Someone who'll understand me by the river bed

You said you would
But you never will change
You only do it if I do the same
Love is such a dangerous game
A dangerous game

At first I could see
That you were weak in the knees
Your smile was so rehearsed
When you gave me your t-shirt
On the honeymoon
Where we never left the room
Sometimes I want to go back there
But then I'll remember
I've got to remember

You're always such a spectacle
Guess it was the best you could do
Your favourite dress for the world to see through
You spilled your drink but you didn't mean to
You're always such a spectacle
You said would but you never will change
You only do it if I do the same
Love is such a dangerous game
A dangerous game

When you told me this
That wickedness is a myth
That was invented for losers
Cause baby the truth hurts
Baby the truth hurts

Well I thought you were shallow
But then I fell in deep
Why couldn't you keep it
Our little secret
You're my only weakness

You're always such a spectacle
Guess it was the best you could do
Your favourite dress for the world to see through
You spilled your drink but you didn't mean to
Love is such a spectacle
Just when you think it's going well for you
Life's a movie that we sleep through
Every little thing that we do

You're always such a spectacle
Nothing ever really does change
Cause if you feel it baby
Know I feel the same
Love is such a dangerous game
Love is such a dangerous game
A dangerous game

Just wait and see

You can't regret what you forget
If only you could forget it
But it takes time and plenty of wine
The weight of the world there in your eyes

And nothing good will ever come to you unless you try try try
You find yourself in trouble if you cannot tell a lie
It's easy as pie

There the sweetest of pleasures are found
No matter where I go
There'll be memories that tug at my sleeve
But there will also be
More to question, yet more to believe
Oh tell me where?
Where is the someone who will turn and look at me?
And want to share
My every sweet-imagined possibility?
The more I live - the more I learn
The more I learn - the more I realize
The less I know
Each step I take 
(Papa, I've a voice now!)
Each page I turn 
(Papa, I've a choice now!)
Each mile I travel only means
The more I have to go

With all there is - why settle for
Just a piece of sky?

Off of his back shit cause, then we bust them guns

Up jumps the boogie, cause the track is so thoed
Got me breaking down bubble gum, I'm fin to be so blowed
Nothing but clouds in the sky, but it's still sunny
Cause I'm puffing on some good green, pocket full of money
Southside, I'm wrecking for where I lay my head at
Disrespect me, you the nigga I'ma spray my lead at
I'm living for today, don't give a fuck about tomorrow
I'm robbing you motherfuckers, it ain't no need to borrow
Money from dad, that nigga wouldn't lend me no cash
Seventeen he threw me out, like the trash
It's all gravy baby, I'm connected with the street my mama Ridgevan
And daddy East and West, Cancel Creek the dopefiends love me
I got a cousin, named Mard
Everytime I bring him outside, suckers be running up in my yard
Smartest thing I got is a 20, and you could get a whole sale
If you want it soft, let me run back to the motel

Running to the ceiling, what it's fin to be
Blowing cigarillos, no more swisha sweet
But regular weed, a gangsta fa sho I am
(are you gon make it to the top), nigga you know I am
Flipping in a four do', trying to get some mo' do'

Sean Moyses,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing

Sean Moyses,"Of all the boys I've known, and I've known some
Until I first met you, I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me

You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist do schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

Sean Nowell,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

Reminiscing bout you and me
Thinking how it used to be
It's plain and clear I treated you bad
But girl you know that I care
Every relation have wear and tear
Just draw near girl and try to hear and listen what my heart says

Many days and many nights
Many heartbreaks, many fights
Many wrongs but so many rights
So girl don't let this love die
Never meant to cause you no pain,
Girl I never meant to treat you lame.
Gimme one more chance rewind come back again.
Don't let this love die.

Just cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

Can you feel me reaching out to you girl, can you hear my open thoughts
Never want disrespect you girl don't let this come break us apart.
'Cause I know I would die without you, my girl can you hear my broken heart.
It's calling out to the good times that we had back at the start.

Baby (Don't call me baby)
You know I need you in my life daily (You know you played me)
I was a player but now your love changed me (Dead wrong)
I'm going crazy (I'm gone)
Never thought losing you would be so hard

It's your turn to cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

So let go
And move on
What we were
Is now undone
My tears have all dried
It's your turn now to cry

You're losing your love and your trust for me girl
And you know, I would go to the ends of the world.
If you wanted, just like we started.
Girl 'cause I don't want to fight no more.
Make it like it was before.

I tell you the truth and you cried and I cried
Let's get back to the place and that look in your eyes
Can you feel it inside, no clouds in your skies
The sun is gonna shine

Chat to her Santana

It's your turn to cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)

And if there's still a doubt up ina your brain
Then just de-load it

Upon the search, true love we found it
And up the river of life together

Hand me a gram, shoot
Misunderstanded with the family man, shoot
I'm banging, I'm Beirut
I'm training in state boots
I hang with the same group
Aim at your grapefruit

I can't relate, duke
The trey pound's related to the ache in the face full
Nigga, I hate you, break you, Ivan Drago
I'm rushing to put pellets in your pecan pronto

Solomon Grundy

I made my bones shaving Sharon Stones in a school zone
One way ticket from the projects to a pool home
Trapping, balling, and rappin is the hoods holy trinity
I sold a pack 'fore I lost my virginity
Surrounded by speed freaks and weed geeks
Quiet down, listen up when g's speak
Return of the body catcher, the crown's been captured
Caught up in the rapture, I slaughtered a bunch of rappers
Ain't no Tarzan in the marshland
Fumes from the meth cook turn me into the swamp man
Get the red wine out
White lines in Amy Winehouse
Walk fine lines in hindsight
Coulda made some better choices
I didn't always have to listen to the voices
Thug in my bloodline, mud pies and drug buys
The dead live on and love dies

Ill Bill murder futuristic like Paul Laffoley
Haul your casket away
Assassins'll spray
Reptilian like a cannibal's brain
Horrifying like dying in a two-passenger plane
Nosediving, fire in the sky, showers of flame
Houses of pain on cypress hills and mountainous terrain
Even a lion chills after an ounce of sour to the face
I'm the lightning that the Vikings worshipped
The sight of when a rifles bursting
Write subversive
I'm a decisive person
Liquor on a bullet wound, feel the Henny sting
Everything is everything
I'm a Heavy Metal King
Been labeled intelligent, irreverent, malevolent
True indeed, plus a veteran
On point like the Devil's chin
Surrounded by apparitions & statues of smiling death
Assassins with pistols capture your dying breath
Like you stepped into a horror flick
Kill you then resurrect you in the middle of a blizzard of hollow tips

Now my mom an' dad broke up when I was 4 years old
When I was seven she went and got herself another man; it was hell, y'all
I left home 'fore I was 14 years of age; I figured I'd do better on my own
But then followed eleven years of bumb'lin' around and livin' kinda hand-in-mouth
Sometimes gettin' locked up an' somet- sometimes just goin' cold and hungry
I didn't have me no real school education, 
So what in the hell what I was gonna be able to do?
But I always did pick on the guitar; I used to put the hat out for spare change
But now I'm makin' this here record and I'm still tryin' to get your spare change
I don't know why went wrong but it ain't bad now
And I just keep playin' my dog house music
Sing the dog house song...!
Aoooh! Ooh oohooh
Aoooh! Ooh oohooh
Aoooh! Ooh oohooh
Sing the dog house song...!

Romantic words streamed like blood.

Erase the bliss that once was the past.

Only to whither in time.

Seatrain,"She stays in a castle of her own making.
Fools in the courtyard with a jester or two.
Though the walls are made of stone, they're always shaking.
She answers to no one for what she don't do.

In the realms of confusion, she's the one who'll say, ""I know.""
She moves in her own time
And just comes to remind
That she must go.

She knows just how to walk, 
She chooses when she needs to run,
When she's alone then
She can float then.
She can fly when she's at one.

A meadow surrounds us whenever I find her.
She walks in a garden wherever she goes.
We meet on the drawbridge; guards stand behind her.
She rings with her fingers the bells on her toes.

Across crowded ballrooms I've searched, aching for a sign.
She meets none of my needs,
And still I can't leave her behind.",Portrait of the Lady as a Young Artist

And a race called man walks dead from birth
And the beast and man both bear the curse.

So cling to what's true and tell the world too.
Cause some live in fear, oppression from peers.

And they shut their ears and laugh cause you pray,
But don't be afraid, that used to be me I used to mock God
But I was empty.

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there

To share the glory if I'm allowed to
'cause nothing can be lost
This magic never existed, I hope I never miss it
Leave it alone, let it die
It can't be worth the pain we've hidden
Nothing will be lost; a love that couldn't be trusted
Is it worth the time that we'll abuse? (X3)

I'm naked and loose when no one's home
And I may let my fingers roam

Praying to the beast that stole the sex from me
I see something we should do
If you need one, then you need two
I won't hold back, so why should you?
I won't hold back, so why should you?
Here I am, on my knees

Ain't no way out and the wheels are lazy
Give a livin' when you're that again

Fell apart as humans will, they walked away from everything
Carry a lantern, 'cause I may live away
Where I can relax when I leave this place
Defined by age, I'm a monkey in rage
Store it in rhythm 'cause they cover more space (?)

Wild with daisies, I'm a hardcore punk

",No Way Out
Sebadoh,"With my head so low, the way I think could scrape the ground
I will give them all control, I will crumble all around
There's no need to say a word as logic burns right trough my head
I could almost laugh out loud, the way this silence leaves me dead
Feel afraid to speak, and I feel afraid to smile
As I crave sacred attention, you could hit me all the while
And you might be the weaker one, and I may stand and stare
But I'll always know my place to keep this order safe, not sane

I haven't got time to teach you what it could be like
To pull you from this, child
You don't smell the stink, but your mind has found the bed
You think I'm all yours and I wish that I were dead
The words were not your own, it was something your mother said
Umbilical bloodline, mind control, by the whiny chat (?)
Sister, oh sister, I thought it'd be nice
That thing I felt when we first met just will not suffice
The glimmer in your eyes
I love you, sister
A bloodline to condescend
I thought so, sister, but I cannot pretend
It's hard to believe this blood, this isn't healthy love

It isn't from your mouth

Not there to soothe your soul, friend to tender friend
I think our love is coming to an end

To force what I don't feel

If all we have is a question,
There's no hope to find a future
But something in me cries for you
It feels too real this time

I think I love you, though I don't know what love means

Could I trust you when I've lied to myself before?
Will I do it all again to taste what I've imagined we could be?

Look what I've become;
This pressure that we feel
In a world of possibilities,
This may not prove real
But could we give enough,
Backed against a wall?

But too far to fall

I can't always have what I'm wanting
And now I'm wanting you
But if you don't want me
I'll have to set you free

I'll have to learn to live without you

And I learn humility
Twisted moral planes
As real as circumstance, each night I dance with primal urges

That always start as they are ending
In my dreams I walk with my true friends
We discover secrets; we run through our lives
Everything is twisted like abyss
To the past and distant future

I'm not an Adam or Eve, I'm just a nervous young thing

The crate will break and I'll fall, I couldn't help it at all
I've got a license to confuse, what do we got to lose?
A license to confuse
I guess I got what it takes to help me make this mistake
It took a while but I learned, it took a twist but I turned
And now its clear that I'm blind, another mountain to climb
Another distance to fall, I couldn't help it all
I've got a license to confuse, what have you got to lose?
A license to confuse
I shouldn't sound so forlorn, regret the day I was born
'cause here I am and I've been, I only need a few friends
My hands are sweating all day like I've been letting me down
Like I've been letting me slide, just some nonsense on my mind
And the license to confuse, nothing I can use

Here's my license that's my right




",License to Confuse

I'm wound tighter than a magnet's coil
The longer I try to keep my mouth shut
The sooner little brain is gonna boil
And if you turn back just to fuck me up
I'll cut you loose and watch you fall
It feels good just to bitch about it
Scratch that itch until it bleeds
But I don't really wanna lose you
But I can't play the silent game
'cause when I talk the silence follows
You never say what's on your mind
If you laugh to see me so defensive
I'll know I've made another enemy
Nobody wants another mirror on their fears
I guess that's all you are to me
But I don't really wanna lose this
Does it all depend on me?
It's always personal between us

",Magnet's Coil

Nothing thrills you like denial
There's nothing wrong with the need to please
And children know no shame
Baby on your bended knees and she'd love to play your game
She's a curious girl easily swayed by your force of will
Empty to be filled with the hunger for more
What if time denies you, the key to your fulfillment fails?
Around the world again on a boat that sinks as it sails
Stand shoulders above her
Pick her up when you love her
Rub it right when you use her
Need it so bad you abuse her
But don't leave her alone 'cause soon she'll be tasting
The sweet unknown
If it feeds her candy she'll follow it home
Make your claim, she's legally yours
When she shares your name
But don't lose control 'cause you'll scare her away
Go on beg her to stay

It's never resolved, I'm nervous when you call
My words are limp, and my mind is dry
I try to be polite, but I feel like I'm stuck for life
I follow my heart, it leads me far from you
No matter how close we are, I'm far, far away
I have too much now to fill my day today
I'm not a good friend, I'm not a friend at all
I don't need obligations to our crippled conversations
I'd never tell you, it's something you should know
I'm not a friend at all, oh, please let me go

Everywhere I go I feel it

A sad, sloppy mess
Lookin' for approval
And easily impressed
Beware they say, but why would I listen?
I need to know what I've been missing
I'm no one you can trust
All little-boy lonely with curious lust
Confusion turns me upside down
Lost as quickly as I'm found
But soon enough it turns around
On the rebound
Call it fate or true love, never forced romance
Fell into a new love
Maybe perfect love by chance
Beware they say, but why would I listen
When it feels this good?
No one lives their life
Doing all the things they say they should
Confusion turns me upside down
Lost as quickly as I'm found
But soon enough it turns around

But I know what I would like you to be
A one-night stand under stoned persuasion
But a joy that I can't hide

And this confusion wears me down
Until I feel like a nervous stranger

A nervous bug in my system, it keeps me edgy and ashamed
I've got a saint, never ever will forgive
That never understood me but still tells me how to live
It fits when I stretch and I stretch because I can
I stretch until I'm sore and then I open up for more
I do it out of habit, not addiction
And if I give it up, clean out my blood
Will I still feel bored and disconnected?
If I do it all for love, will I ever give enough?

Tell him everything that you told me
Tell him that I'm still your friend
And maybe you would like to see me again
I'm willing to wait my turn to be with you
But I still have a lot to learn about me
And no one's sure if we should be together
But oh, when I saw you again
A beautiful friend, she opened up her heart and let me in
No, I cannot lie to you
I'm still in love with you, and I only wanna be with you
So when you see him again
Tell him everything that you told me
We're more than friends and maybe we should start again

Traced a pattern in the wood
I thought I'd get my shit together

Hand in hand, we set off on our own
But Heaven's not ours, and truth could be a game we play
Strip the branches bare, but the tree stands on its own

Quiero reír y no llorar
Quiero seguir y no parar
Quiero subir y no bajar
Pero te pienso
Hay algo que me impide continuar
Y aunque no quiero regresar
No sé cómo ocultar mi triste sentimiento

Es imposible olvidarte
De mis pensamientos sacarte
De recordar la manera de que haciamos el amor
Yo te di mi amor y mi vida
No vuelvas arrepentida cuando te des cuenta de tu error

Alguien robó tu corazón
Vienes y me quitas la ilusión
Y por ti no creo en el amor

Alguien robó tu corazón
Vienes y me quitas la ilusión

By your story and the way you explained me
How you start to make this change
It was frightening , It’s surprising
You come to play and lost control
But your childhood shows instead and (it)breaks you down

All those stories we were reading
Keep it strong  keep us strong

You describe me in wich place you want to say
But there’s nowhere you felt
To let something, something happening

not by yourself hold on 
let it float
life test you hold on
you come with self restrain too 
it's a better choice  

all this time you're waiting 
to come closer  you're wanting 
with all your soul
but it starts to drive you insane
when the days are closing in
you lose control 

you never felt so odd since you're out of time
your will will never stop you  waste time
you cannot take your fate when it's coming along 
I bet you if you stay you will just feel it's too long  

if the sky fills with dark clouds i will always be with you
if the houses and building are trembling i will always be here
if you start to feel insecure i will always be with you 
if the sky seems to fall on you i will always be here

You were  so  close to faint and  fall down ,   
Through  this desert  of stone  ,

from this  old time we saved 
some faded blurry pictures 
in your white  dress  twirling  around
jumping in  the waves  and laughing

for this star , you would  have  traveled 
you would  have searched  to find by train

(I want it all, Don't leave right now)
(I'll give you everything)

(I want it all, Don't leave right now)
(I'll give you everything)",Maybe
Secondhand Serenade,"Please forgive me if I seem forward
But I've never been in front of anything like you
Its the last place I ever thought I'd be
When I woke up this morning
Is it true?
And that you're always this breathtaking
And your smart and you're willing
My God this is killing me

Tell me all the things you never said
We can lie here and talk for hours in my bed

I don't have anything to hide
I don't have anything
Everything is not for certain
I don't have anything to hide
I don't have anything
Everything is not for certain

You started to see right through me
And I'm loving every minute of it
Its like I'm born again
Every time I breath in so,
If you're curious,
My favorite color's blue
And I like to sing in the shower
If you like, I'll sing to you

Tell me all the things you never said
We can lie here and talk for hours in my bed

I don't have anything to hide
I don't have anything
Everything is not for certain
I don't have anything to hide
I don't have anything
Every thing is not for certain

Tell me all of your hopes,
All of your dreams
I want you to take me there (take me there)
Tell me all of your hopes,
All of your dreams
I want to take you there (take you there)
Tell me everything
Every breath, I want you to know I'll be there
There's just one more thing,
One request
I want you to take me with you

Take me with you
I will never let you down
I will love you now and forever",Take Me with You
Secondhand Serenade,"The best thing about tonight's that we're not fighting
It couldn't be that we have been this way before
I know you don't think that I am trying
I know you're wearing thin down to the core

But hold your breath

Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Don't make me change my mind

Or I won't live to see another day
I swear its true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find

This is not what I intended
I always swore to you I'd never fall apart
You always thought that I was stronger
I may have failed
But I have loved you from the start

Oh, but hold your breath

Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Don't make me change my mind
I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
It's impossible to find

So breathe in so deep
Breathe me in
I'm yours to keep

And hold onto your words
'Cause talk is cheap
And remember me tonight when you're asleep

Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Don't make me change my mind
I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find

Tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Don't make me change my mind
I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find",Fall for You
Secondhand Serenade,"It's a shame that it had to be this way
It's not enough to say I'm sorry
It's not enough to say I'm sorry

Maybe I'm to blame
Or maybe we're the same
But either way I can't breathe
Either way I can't breathe

All I had to say is goodbye
We're better off this way
We're better off this way

I'm alive but I'm losing all my drive
Cause everything we've been through
And everything about you
Seemed to be a lie
A guiltless twisted lie
It made me learn to hate you
Or hate myself for letting it pass by

All I had to say is goodbye
We're better off this way
We're better off this way
All I had to say is goodbye
We're better off this way
We're better off this way

And every, everything isn't only
What it seemed so hold these
Words that you never told me
Its time to say goodbye
Its time to say goodbye
Its time to say goodbye
Goodbye

Bye

Take my pain away
Tear it out
Tell me I was wrong
Tell me I was wrong

Take my pain away
Tear it out
Tell me I was wrong
Tell me I was wrong

Take my pain away
Tear it out
Tell me I was wrong
Tell me I was wrong

(And so on)",Goodbye
Secondhand Serenade,"I dream a lot, I know you say
I've got to get away
""The world is not yours for the taking""
Is all you ever say
I know I'm not the best for you,
But promise that you'll stay
'Cause if I watch you go,
You'll see me wasting, you'll see me wasting away

'Cause today, you walked out of my life
'Cause today, your words felt like a knife
I'm not living this life

Goodbyes are meant for lonely people standing in the rain
And no matter where I go it's always pouring all the same
These streets are filled with memories
Both perfect for detected pain
And all I wanna do is love you
But I'm the only one to blame

'Cause today, you walked out of my life
'Cause today, your words felt like a knife
I'm not living this life

But what do I know, if you're leaving
All you did was stop the bleeding
But these scars will stay forever,
These scars will stay forever
And these words have no meaning
If we cannot find the feeling
That we held on to together
Try your hardest to remember

Stay with me,
Or watch me bleed,
I need you just to breathe

'Cause today, you walked out of my life
(Stay with me, or watch me bleed)
'Cause today, your words felt like a knife
(I need you just to breathe)
I'm not living this life",Like a Knife
Secondhand Serenade,"It seems all of these words couldn't be further from the truth
How did I get here? What did I do?

Your eyes, telling me lies
And making me find myself
While you have your agenda, a life to pursue

So please,
Let me be free from you.
And please, let me be free
I can face the truth

I'm blind to all of your colors
That used to be rainbow then
My eyes, where did they go to?
Why disappear?

It's hard to be all alone
I never got through your disguise
I guess I'll just go, and face all my fear

So please,
Let me be free from you.
And please, let me be free
I can face the truth

Put down your world
Just for one night
Pick me again

So please,
Let me be free from you.
And please, let me be free
I can face the truth",Pretend
