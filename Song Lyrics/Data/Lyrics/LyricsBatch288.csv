M.O.P.,"Firing Squad nigga, Firing Squad
'First Family', top notch nigga, BD

I used to have so much confidence in myself
But now my game is changed and my pain's been felt
My hand's been dealt but it was a missed deal
And words won't express the way a man William feel

I came up with them thugs, I grew up in that mud
Got my hands covered in blood, to stay
Above the world
(To see a better day)
Please my children need and I can't find a fuckin' way

What can I say, I'ma stressed ghetto soldier
I'm shell shocked from a back block off Saratoga
Remember what I told ya, I'm thirsty now
In fact I feel like everybody's out to hurt me now

Roll wit me now, am I the only cat that never see
The M slash O dash P on your TV and the Industry
Keep fucking wit me, so I brought my cousins wit me
From now on they gon' be thuggin' wit me

Eyes and ears, nigga, blunts and beers, nigga
For months and years it been Blood, Sweat and Tears
Nigga, raise your metal for Firing Squad royalty
'First Family', royalty, holla

How many niggas plan to ride wit us?
(Ride wit us)
How many niggas came to die wit us?
(Die wit us)
Pop shots nigga, we don't give a fuck
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck

How many niggas plan to ride wit us?
(Ride wit us)
How many niggas came to die wit us?
(Die wit us)
Pop shots nigga, we don't give a fuck
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck

This is only the beginning, you ain't know one was comin'
Stand face to me, no more runnin'
Back from hell, the dramatic, automatic
Rap track flippin' acrobatic

Yo we been in this game for damn near a whole decade
To the death 'til the Firing Squad, cop the next tape
Brownsville slugger, knucka up in the house
Had a rumble with the Grim Reaper, knuckled it out

This ain't for you big willies, this is for my small paws
Thuggin' wit guns in they draws
Go against the grain, break all laws
And keep a bitch wit him, wit drugs in her bra

Brooklyn, brainiest, blast
Ain't nothing changed since that nigga been past
Sound, pound, make you wanna bark
Specialized by Firing Squad, the underdogs, c'mon

How many niggas plan to ride wit us?
(Ride wit us)
How many niggas came to die wit us?
(Die wit us)
Pop shots nigga, we don't give a fuck
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck

How many niggas plan to ride wit us?

How many niggas came to die wit us?

Pop shots nigga, we don't give a fuck
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck

(It's the Firing Squad assassins)
Ghetto blastin'
Operation' ran by your man toucan, dance for thug fashion
(Criminal passion)
Top of the line, it's unnecessary, buries but we still manage to shine
(Take a life son)
Fuck that
You know the verdict your only a soldier duke but don't get murdered

You heard I was raised with the elements, it's William
And if you feel him then don't fuck with my intelligence
I'm from the Ville
(That's home)
I holds my own being that my father's reflection have connected

And roam, blow 'em and check 'em wit chrome, have ya heard of me
I heard you wanna hit me, split me, murder me
So I, regulate, designate, demonstrate
Blow back you fools wit tools, set 'em straight

What you want nigga? What it's gon' be?
I'ma be leavin' you leakin' with clip in the palmy
I'ma son of a gun, a automatic 4 5th
Gun shots let off for my dogs, leave your boy stiff

Ghetto warfare, heavy metal warfare
Play a part 'fore you fuck around and start a war here
(We bust back)
Collapse, I'm rated are, bringin' it real strong 'cause you niggas
Still gon' hit me pa, y'all want me, come find me motherfucker

How many niggas plan to ride wit us?

M.O.P.,"""Yeah, they talkin about rap."" 
""We don't rap, its not about rap we livin it what they talkin about. 
It's not about college or what you read in a newspaper or magazine. 
It's hear its reality, this is our nature. Its how we live.""

[Guru]
Now everybody on Earth want to rap, we burnt all of that
Knocked off the game, and cold broke is spat
Gang Starr, will Billy Danze and Big Slap
Word to Laze, big schools and big gats

You didn't whip it right so pick up the pace
Word to grimy niggas, they want to stick up the place
Word to hiphop, plus a crib that's laced
Primo's breaks, activate the mental, that's all

We got credentials galore, fuck a small vending tour
Yet, still, I be at the around-the-way spots
Near where niggas be slinging innocent get hit by straight shots
And brave cops, protect the community

While corrupt cops, be harassing you and me
Pullin me over, in front of the crib, in front of my neighbors
Askin for favors, here's a cassette and why you 
Question my behavior?

Pursuing me, trying to catch me off quard
I shrug scars, you see a lot of hoes at thug bars
I don't care what these beats my do
We'll sun you, plus I see right through

It's way it means to me and M.O.P.
Just To Get a Rep, nigga, you best to step, nigga, Salute!

[Chorus]
Holdin it down
Phony ass rappers
Dead serious 
Finish em
(Is this hiphop) Hell no this is war
Heavy artillery, in my vicinty
*repeat - change 5th line to: M.O.P.*

[Billy Danze]
Ah-yo, the game's called survival *echoes* I admit
As a soldier, I've done a lot of shit
To the so-called tough dude, I ain't mad at you
But I wish I wouldn't of had to do the shit I had to do

It's true, I would jump up in a Bamma
And travle miles of road to unload this hammer
(And I) Notice ?colors? when they glance
At the baby boy of Haddy and Frank Danze

I won't stress the blazin
But I will think about what size slug best for the occasion
(It's so amazin) ???? pop shit
Like Windy Williams till you fuckers bury me

(Who we be!) What, what's wrong, nigga?
(First Family) Come, come on, nigga!
(Ain't nothin cute) My niggas is ready to shoot
For the love of the First Family thugs, Salute!

[Chorus]

[Lil' Fame]
Before you slit your wrist, bitch, imagine this
M.O.P., Gang Starr (Damn!) hazardous
Thugs that got love for this hiphop and shit
Makin words rhyme at the same time poppin shit

I used to go to jams, and drop grammar
Before I left niggas told me (Boy take your hammer!)
Sure nuff, shit got rowdy
Dumped off my first clip at a house party

I love this rap shit, though, the love is clear
But fuck the parties, my nigga, I lost a brother there
Only if I'm gettin paid (That's right)
And the shit gon' benefit the trade

I snatch a mic, turn it out, bad
Even have you smooth niggas fuckin up yours shoes and your outfit
I be, the Brownsville slugger (Signing out)
Act like you know what I'm about, Salute!

[Chorus]","Salute, Pt.2"
M.O.P.,"A big city baby 

Time to bend on some shit 

y'all people don't understand 

That shit is real out here 

I'm a tell y'all a story 

Now this story didn't happen too long ago 

And it wasn't that far away 

Its about some real niggas 

Niggas doin real things aight 

So let me get to the first page and Ill break it down like this 

Chapter one 



[ Lil Fame ] 

I was a young child  lost  went to church on Sundays 

Walking a narrow road that lead me to gunplay 

I was a good boy respect my mommy 

Looked up to them OGs like Querto, Phil, and Donny 

Felt good as a young nigga 

Comin home from school gettin love from them neighborhood drug dealers 

Wrote change, Cadillac Sevilles 

But spoke real, was a tradition, Brownsville 

That was the first chapter, passin these stages 

But the book is wider and its a lot more pages 

The game changed, people got foul 

And the same little chuch boy is buckwild 

Runnin wit my homeboys from three three nine 

And one five four five, totin four fives 

I kept dreams of being a rap dude 

But I know the streets too well so I pack tools 

I lost a lot of loved ones to these streets 

And lost a lot of loved ones over beef 

That goes to show these streets haunt ya 

Look what society created now, a monsta 



[ chorus: M.O.P. ] 

My day and age was a different role 

Its when a slug take a niggas soul 

(Slug take a niggas soul) 

Follow your dreams and follow your goals 

Cause who knows what the future holds? 

(Who knows what the future holds?) 

Our man died and was left cold 

Because a slug took the niggas soul 

(Slug took the niggas soul) 

Follow your dreams and follow your goals 

Cause who knows what your future holds 

(This is what your future holds) 



[Billy Danze] 

I wish somebody would lend a hand 

So they could see how I fell inside 

I'm on an emotional roller coaster ride 

Nothing to hide 

A long time ago I set aside my pride 

And used my past as a ghetto guide 

A few good men died, several wept stood beside me 

So I could smooth out the road for those that come behind me 

You know where you can find me 

Out on the back blocks 

Grippin black glocks in front of crack spots 

Its just a hobby 

And since I was a baby 

Thuggin, smokin, drinkin, totin is how the first family raised me 

( He who lives as a gangter, will perish in these streets ) 

I know that's deep 

But I still shed tears for my mother, two years 

After shed been laid to rest 

And still some things I need to chisel off my chest 

My remedy for stress, I conversate wit my oldest brother 

Ten years after his death 

I know there's nothin left 

So I'm forced to take a deep breath 

Before I attempt to take another step 

A lot of brothas slept 

A lot of brothas was left cold in the street and told 

This is what your future holds 



[ chorus ] 



So there you have it 

You see, a lot of niggas talk about bullshit 

Talkin about cars, jewels, and money 

But in all reality, we all come out the same bag of shit 

Some of us may never see tomorrow 

So my niggas 

don't you never don't you ever forget where you come from 

Salute 

M.O.P. for life baby",What the Future Holds
M.O.P.,"Yeah, check it out why'all. Firing Squad, nigga. (First Family) 
Yeah, Firing Squad, nigga. Check it out. (First Family) 

The name's Bill (What up Bill?) 
I'ma semi-automatic addict for real 
Before you test me 
Know I feel that the impact from a gat when it kicks back is sexy 
I put you motherfuckers back on the ?rip? 
Tip and get the split in a nigga's shit 
(Ain't nothin changed) I take you motherfuckers back to 86 
And get to dumpin off a clip 
(You know the game) You want to test me? (You gotta) 
Let your time be, there's a long line of niggas that's ready to wrong 
me, I put my foot down firmly 
Stick the nose of my gun in some shit that don't concern me 
And most dudes don't like the way I rap 
The brown-skinned cat with a helluva fast step, yep 
Berkuance, (Retreat!) 
I would never be disconnected from these streets 
Its deep, as the (ocean!) and my (potion!)

*repeat*

Verse One: Billy Danze
Yo I grew up on an ill path (St. ?)
Posted up on the hill with the real Homicide Staff

It's a hundred situations ampin me
The block (hot) cop a (top shots) at your whole fucking family
(Sup, Billy Danze?) True (Clap, clap) Who the fuck are you?
(Clap, clap) What the fuck you wanna do? (Fuck you)
I been caught in a deathrap twice, managed to slip through it
Wacked four niggaz, and I still gotta do it
(Hell ya) You know the street game
Welcome new players to these homicide layers to be slain
Look both ways before you cross a nigga
Decent families have lost a nigga, that came across a nigga
He knew wasn't havin shit
He seen him lick off and kickoff a whole fucking click
(Whole fuckin click, Premeditaion) On a daily basis
And nickel M and M's may be pressed against your faces
Nobody cares if your mother cry
They don't a FUCK if your brother die 
(Don't give a fuck about you)

Chorus

Verse Two: Lil' Fame *rapping to the baseline*
These motherfuckers wanna stop me, it ain't hard to count
But it'll be a cold day in hell
I would never change, my style or my profile
Or the way I put myself down (cha down) *main beat resumes*
Why do fuckers, motherfuckers
Wanna fuck around with this livest shit?
Chrome 44's, soul survivalers (Unstoppable!)
Got a crew to drop a crew, remarkable
The infinite, fizzy wo magnificent 
I know ya wanna see me dead 
Sprawled out with some thick red shit leaking from my head
Hollerin: rest in peace, making money off my rap songs
Callin it the best of M.O.P. (Motherfucker!)
Fuck that! I send the goons out to get ya
Hit ya, and take them knew jacks down wit ya
LEAVE EM DEAD STINKIN
And put your brains on the outside
To the let the world see the sheisty shit you was thinkin
This nigga can't change(Nah)
This nigga can't rearrange(Nah)
The way a thug do his thing (Yeah)
Never let em get the best of me
I put the metal to your temple
And catch the next plane to the West Indies

(Fly, baby) Nigga,(Motherfuckers)! (Fly, nigga)
I wan't y'all niggaz to undestand one motherfuckin thing
This M.O.P. shit is for real, nigga

Yo Bill, what'd you stop for man, what'd you stop for?
Teach 'em, tell 'em how you feel!

As I struggle to get my hands, on a dollar today
I think back about cats, that have passed away
That's why I feel more cursed than blessed
And I wonder what in this world, more worse than stress
I'm a mess with stress, though I present it with finesse
Sometimes I feel as if my heart is comin out my chest
I smoke too many ciggarettes; and the Remi won't
Wash away the pain or get, strain off my brain
See it's the way, we, roll down here, stroll down here
A shootout, is like a common cold out here
That's why I sit back and I laugh at y'all
When it's crunchtime on the frontline, I will blast at y'all
I'm from Saratoga Avenue, I +HAD+ to brawl
It's where I realized it's a cold world, after all
You hear me talkin to ya? I'm on some grown Danze shit
(You'll be comin of age) My life is on a different page;
Able to tame my rage
A little bit different from the first time I picked up a gauge
A little bit different from the first time I stepped on a stage
Take a look at me now; a born winner
In a race against time, like Bruce Jenner
A natural born sinner, can't nobody tame me, or change me

Two Phillies, a dime bag, and a forty ounce of beer
Now look at him, they hittin the scene slow
Who grindin, who thieves, but I'm lookin mean yo
With a gangster lean though, big dog in it
With my chrome ten inch hubcaps, but I keep 'em clean doe
I know the pros and cons so I married the game
Now it's mommy's little boy left to carry the name

My life came crumblin' down like a landslide

Wonderin' how long before me and my moms would be alone 
I remember what he said 
Layin' on his deathbed, rubbin' his shiny bald head 
Respect your sister, don't follow your brothers 
Take care of your mother, I love ya [croaking]

And he has given me
The strength to be as strong as I need to be
That's when I realized he was leavin' me 
It wasn't just my heart or my eyes deceivin' me 
At the age of fourteen 
It was more than just a goal or dream 
To take care of my queen 
It's my turn to stand firm as I could stand

This is for them cats from way, way back
When every pair of sneakers had to have a hat to match
(Damn)
Y'all look good in them sheep skins

Make noise in the middle of the street all week
Always had a plan, it only took a dime to reach out and touch a man
Can't be fuckin' up them sneakers while you at ya jam
Get up on the speakers and your be-Boy stand

I remember the Beemer, I remember the Cadillac
I remember the seat broke backv
I remember the chick wasn't legit unless her ass was fat
Uncle, I remember all that

When the main reason for squeezin' was to let 'em know you got one
Pop shots at the party to see niggas run
When the [unverified] was the worst biggest gun
You niggas had a lotta fun

Spoke rims, white walls, cruisin' the block
In them 98 Oldsmobile wit the rag top

In the wind, wit ya Kangols, Pumas and Lees
Used to drink private stock, Millers and Old Gold
Had the [unverified] sweater when the weather got cold

(Yeah, we like it raw!) (4x)
How about some hardcore?

[ VERSE 1: Billy Danzenie ]
(Yeah, we like it raw in the streets)
For the fellas on the corner posted up 20 deep
With your ifth on your hip, ready to flip
Whenever you empty your clip, dip, trip your sidekick
You got skill, you best manage to chill
And do yourself a favor, don't come nowhere near the Hill
With that bullshit, word, money grip, it'll cost ya
Make you reminisce of Frank Nitty 'The Enforcer'
I move with M.O.P.'s Last Generation
Straight up and down, act like you want a confrontation
I packs my gat, I gotta stay strapped
I bust mines, don't try to sneak up on me from behind
Don't sleep, I get deep when I creep
I see right now I got to show you it ain't nothin sweet
Go get your muthafuckin hammer
And act like you want drama
I send a message to your mama
'Hello, do you know your one son left?
I had license to kill and he had been marked for death
He's up the Hill in the back of the building with two in the dome
I left him stiffer than a tombstone'

[ Li'l Fame ]
How about some hardcore?
(Yeah, we like it raw!) (4x)
How about some hardcore?

[ VERSE 2: Billy Danzenie ]
(Yeah, we like it rugged in the ghetto)
I used to pack sling shots, but now I'm packin heavy metal
A rugged underground freestyler
Is Li'l Fame, muthafucka, slap, Li'l Mallet
When I let off, it's a burning desire
Niggas increase the peace cause when I release it be rapid fire
For the cause I drop niggas like drawers
Niggas'll hit the floors from the muthafuckin .44's
I'm talkin titles when it's showtime
Fuck around, I have niggas call the injury help line
I bust words in my verse that'll serve
Even on my first nerve I put herbs to curbs
I ain't about givin niggas a chance
And I still raise shit to make my brother wanna get up and dance
Front, I make it a thrill to kill
Bringin the ruckus, it's the neighborhood hoods for the Hill that's real
Me and mics, that's unlike niggas and dykes
So who wanna skate, cause I'm puttin niggas on ice
Whatever I drop must be rough, rugged and hard more
(Yeah!)

How about some hardcore?
(Yeah, we like it raw!) (4x)

[ VERSE 3: Billy Danzenie ]
Yo, here I am (So what up?) Get it on, cocksucker
That nigga Bill seem to be a ill black brother
I gets dough from the way I flow
And before I go
You muthafuckas gonna know
That I ain't nothin to fuck with - duck quick
I squeeze when I'm stressed
Them teflons'll tear through your vest
I love a bloodbath (niggas know the half)
You can feel the wrath (Saratoga/St. Marks Ave.)

(Knock, knock) Who's there? (Li'l Fame)
Li'l Fame who? (Li'l Fame, your nigga)
Boom! Ease up off the trigger
It's aight, me and shorty go to gunfights
Together we bring the ruckus, right?
We trump tight, aight?
I earned mine, so I'm entitled to a title
(7 fuckin 30) that means I'm homicidal

How about some hardcore?

Yo, I scream on niggas like a rollercoaster
To them wack muthafuckas, go hang it up like a poster
Niggas get excited, but don't excite me
Don't invite me, I'm splittin niggas' heads where the white be
Try to trash this, this little bastard'll blast it
Only puttin niggas in comas and caskets
I ain't a phoney, I put the 'mack' in a -roni
I leave you lonely (Yeah, yeah, get on his ass, homie)
Up in your anus, I pack steel that's stainless
We came to claim this, and Li'l Fame'll make you famous
I mack hoes, rock shows and stack dough
Cause I'm in effect, knockin muthafuckas like five-o
I'm catchin other niggas peepin, shit, I ain't sleepin
I roll deep like a muthafuckin Puerto-Rican
So when I write my competition looks sadly
For broke-ass niggas I make it happen like Mariah Carey
I got shit for niggas that roll bold

Because yo, mother made em, mother had em and muthafuck em

",G Boy Stance
M.O.P.,"There's times in my life where I just
I just wanna run away, I just
I just wish the pain would stop
I don't wanna cry no more
I wish the pain would go away

Start a day, bad hands make it hard to deal
Sometimes I wanna pull it, end it all with a bullet
Hard to live life to the fullest with all this bullshit
Mad as fuck, a nigga had enough
From jump street, saw my father murder massacre slain
One shot took half of his brain, I recapture the pain
Twenty-three years, three when it happened
Twenty-six now, still I can't stop the tears
Then my mood switch, thinkin' about this sheisty bitch
Kinda funny cause they fake it when they callin' you honey
On your dick when they think a nigga, might be rich
That's when I shit, cause I know you fuck with me for my money
Learned the hard way, ain't no correctin' the grief
Baby moms starts sexin', my so-called beef
Don't give a fuck if they Marked me For Death like Steven
Or relievin' your breathin', long as I'm even 'fore I'm leavin'
Pain

I wish this pain, would go away
We're talkin about the kind of pain that
I wish this pain, would go away
Just gets all up in your heart, and in your soul
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that makes you feel like you can't go on no more
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone

I can't relate to them cats who hold gats at the gate
Is it my fate, am I that nigga, that they love to hate
Solely, slowly, cause I rock a Roley they want my brain gone
Cause of a fuckin' chain on?
Migraine's on, now the pain's warm, I stagger
And I'm hopin' I don't know the cat with the dagger
Penetratin' my heart, rushed thoughts etched in grief
To the City College deceased may you rest in peace
To the families, I never meant to cause no pain
I know the truth, but if you want, then I shoulder the blame
Overcome at times by uncontrollable flames, and multiple pains
Now it seems like I'm goin insane
For the love of you and hip-hop I expand the news
But before my shit drops, I stand accused
Don't you think I wish we all was rich?
One for all it's pain to see your people when they all can't ball
The pain..

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna give no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna receive no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
God, please take the pain away

I can still hear the shots that left my man Big layin'
On my knees cryin' and prayin', then I said
""God why?  Got to know how hard we try
Don't let him die, please don't let my nigga be dead""
But it was too late, California sealed his fate
Gone now, hard to move on now, fuck making songs now
Wish I could die, I could fly
If they don't give a fuck, fuck it why should I?
That's when Big spoke, pulled up in a glistening three
With platinum wings and said, ""Puff listen to me""
He puts his hands on my head and said ""I live through you
Make hits continuous, this is what we do
I know it might be strenuous and times is hard
Just keep the faith cause now we rhyme with God
Plus you owe it to yourself and don't forget the kids""
That's when I opened up my eyes and new Bad Boy lives

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away

I'm tellin' you man
Now don't let these motherfuckers fuck your shit up God
I don't give a fuck who it is
Don't let em fuck yo' paper man, please Big
Focus your mind man, do your albums, make them hot joints
Man fuck these niggaz man
Fuck these niggaz man
And I'ma tell the same thing to you
When you get your shit done, watch your money, and
Hopefully, I pray for you, you be the shit
And soon motherfuckers start screamin' your name out
Like they screamin' all these other, so-called hot niggas
Never take your eyes off that shit yo
Try to get everything you can out of these motherfuckers yo
Ain't no guarantee they gonna love you next year

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain

[Verse One: Lil' Fame]
The new single, kid get your shit mixed
Catch this new slug from the M.O.P. hitlist
It's thorough for the cars, for the clubs, for the Jeeps
(For the fellas on the corner posted up 20 deep)
Hold it down! Home Team back out to sail this
Make 'em collapse with caps and Fame make 'em famous
The ""Downtown SWinger"" gun slingers rock wild
And when I die, I won't be puttin out flames in hell
Cop a 10 milli from the corner store Arab
Fools with truck jewels get stuck for they karats
Hold on you hear somebody comin, you hear somebody gunnin
Them niggas that you run with is runnin
Cause it's (BULLETS OVER BROWNSVILLE!)
I'm from the place where trey-pounds and fo-pounds kill
Fool how that sound? (ILL!)
The star vendor, bend 'em like car fenders
Serve 'em like bartenders, what's next on the agenda?
Dope rap, we drop off crack, they can't stand it
When I'm {?} when only we be gettin 'em open like the 'Ville
With this fresh rush, show me on point in this game
Cause Fame plays well, and I raise well, so I raise hell!

[Hook]
Yeah, go nigga, raise hell!
Yo, yeah, raise hell!
Go nigga, raise hell!

[Verse Two: Billy Danze]
Raise hell, it's another death wish, I guess it's time
To grip nines, to rip behind enemy lines
Where it's ruthless, and get the troopers
That think it's somethin sweet
M.O.P. niggas was raised in the street, kid
Ain't nuttin changed cause I'm rappin, I am a
Ill nigga and I still will bust my hammer
(Is he a gangsta?) Blaze F-A-G's I don't stress 'em
When I, catch 'em I stretch 'em I bless 'em
And let his momma dress 'em
The name's Bill, the game's real, me and Fame feel
We can blow trial, and yo I'm ill
So blaow in your face! (Bla-bla-bla-blaow) to the death
(Buka-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-KLAK) 'til there's nothin left
I ain't gon' be playin no games witchu frauds
Whenever the two guns bustin just don't be trustin this Drama Lord
(Take it to 'em son!) Yeah we got a plan, and
Billy Danze packin more steel than Bugsy Moran{?}
To the terrible organization, it's the M.O.P.'s last generation
Who wanna confrontation?
It's hammer time and I'm layin on you to see me
(Is he a tough guy?) Nah that's how they make him look on TV
Fake jerks I rattle, snake chumps I saddle
And ride they ass all the way to the bus without no truss
The Hill-top, will-rock, non-stop

He can't run, so I ain't gotta chase him
(Do you think you can take him?)
Take him then I back him down and lace him, raise hell!

All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows 
If the stores are all closed

Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.

Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll.

To fall so deep in love
This is not your ordinary
No ordinary love
You were the first to touch my heart
Made everything right again
With your extraordinary love

I get so weak
When you look at me
I get lost inside your eyes
Sometimes the magic is hard to believe
But you're here before my weary eyes
You brought joy to my world
Set me so free
I want you to understand
You are every breath that I breathe

[Chorus]

From the very first time that we kissed
I knew that I just couldn't let you go at all
From this day on, remember this
That you're the only one that I adore
Can't we make this last forever
This can't be a dream
'Cause it feels so good to me

I want to let you know what I was
Going through
All the time we were apart I thought
Of you
You were in my heart

Way too

Know
I would have flown to you
To be where you are

Together

And all the love I have is

How I'm certain that our love was
Meant to be

And maybe that is true  well I don't care 
What do they all know  they got it all wrong 
This is so unfair  they're playing our song 

Nobody gets too much heaven no more 
It's much harder to come by 
I'm waiting in line 
Nobody gets too much love anymore 
It's as high as a mountain 
And harder to climb 

Something's going on, what is wrong 
I want you to be here, why won't you come 
And spend some time with me, can't you see 
Have we come undone 
Is this the end of our song

With how I feel 
How to reveal 
Oooh... what is real love 
As another day fades away 
So I say 

Nobody gets too much heaven no more

I'm waiting in line 
Nobody gets too much love anymore 
It's as high as a mountain

When I was dreaming 'bout you baby
You were dreaming of me
Call me crazy  call me blind

I do  you know I really really do

Well hey
So much I need to say
Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but true
For me there's only you
Been crying since the day
The day you went away

I remember date and time
September twenty second
Twenty five after nine
In the doorway with your case
No longer shouting at each other
There were tears on our faces

And we were letting go of something special
Something we'll never have again
I know, I guess I really really know

Well hey
So much I need to say
Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but true
For me there's only you
Been crying since the day
The day you went away

Been lonely since the day

So sad but true
For me there's only you

How could I carry on

Blind from the road
Hail!

We carry on, carry on
Follow us, we are one
The battle's fought, the deed is done
Our silver hum runs dark and strong
Hand to the heart, lips to the horn
We can stand ?
Hand on my breast, I'll keep you warm

Play yourself a new track, set traps for the future.
On your own.
Can you do it?
The unknown.
Can you face it?

Shifting desire, shifting desire, shifting desire

Rules of conformity, heavy clouds of reason.
They're hiding the beauty of your free distortions.
On your own.
Can you do it?
The unknown.
Can you face it?
With your soul, now you see it.
The landscape is infinite.

The shape of our mutual dream.
Stay calm, hold me tight, give it a chance to take us away.""

It's a very tiny frog
But it's also very special
You can only find it in the jungle
So far away from me
But if you find it and if you touch it
Your world can change forever

If you touch its skin
You can feel your body changing
And your vision also
And blue becomes red and red becomes blue
And your mommy suddenly becomes your daddy
And everything looks like a giant cupcake

And you keep laughing and laughing and laughing
Nothing is ever quite the same really
And after you finish laughing
It's time to turn into a frog yourself
It's very funny to be a frog
You can dive into the water
And cross the rivers and the oceans
And you can jump all the time and everywhere
Do you want to play with me?

We can be a whole group of friends
A whole group of frogs
Jumping into the streets
Jumping into the planet
Climbing up the buildings
Swimming in the lakes and in the bathtubs
We would be hundreds, thousands, millions
The biggest group of friends the world has ever seen
Jumping and laughing forever

Will you stand in this land forever?

Across the time and space
A never-ending dance
A blooming and a trance
You make me feel my soul
There's no more loneliness
Only sparkles and sweat
There's no more single fate
You make me feel myself

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

Capsize me and douse me in your bay
A shiver of want, always
When you are on the tip of my tongue
In the back of your parked car
I could build a fort
And play all day
Between your lips and mine
Let's stay here forever""

To bring it back to me

You gotta go
Where I cry
I'm taking on the tears
I wanna see if you can try
Drink a little bit of it

No
No

Where I am
I'm ticking back in time
I wanna see if you can spot
You finally calm my head at night

I need you
No I don't
Just keep me one more time
While I try to be a friend
So it can be the end

M:G,"Don't think I can't feel there's something wrong
You've been the sweetest part of my life so long
I look in your eyes, there's a distant light
And you and I know there'll be a storm tonight
This is getting serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us

[Chorus]
Don't say what you're about to say
Look back before you leave my life
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Baby think twice

Baby think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory
For the fire and the faith that was you and me
Baby I know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for a higher ground
'Coz when you're halfway up, you're always halfway down
But baby this is serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us

[Chorus]

Baby this is serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us

Don't say what you're about to say
Look back before you leave my life
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice

Don't do what you're about to do
My everything depends on you
And whatever it takes, I'll sacrifice
Before you roll those dice

They said, ""Come on, Ma let's go to the cabaret""

I wanna learn that dance
Don't you see the dance you call your big black bottom

Come on and show me your black bottom
I want to learn that dance

I want to see the dance you call the black bottom
I want to learn that dance
Come on and show that dance you call your big black bottom

Get up and show your old man your black bottom
I want to learn that dance

Now I'm gonna show y'all my black bottom
They stay to see that dance
Wait until you see me do my big black bottom

Moi c'est Ma2x à peine 18ans à mon arc
Et j'ai le flow, le style ne t'inquiètes pas je mène ma barque
Je sais que la route est longue y arriver n'est pas une victoire
Il faut pouvoir ce maintenir afin de marquer l'histoire
La musique je la connais
Longtemps que je suis abonné
Je lâchais quelques rimes en mode d'emploi pour les nouveaux nés
De l'inspi pleins les veines avec de l'énergie à revendre
J'fais tellement cramer l'instru qu'il n'en restera que des cendres
Je chante pour la paix
Et aussi pour la gloire

Powietrze przybiera ksztalt rzeczy dowolny.

Ptak smetny siedzi na drzewie,
Leniwie piora wygladza.
Ranek przechodzi w poludnie,
Bezwladnie mijaja godziny.
Czasem zabrzeczy mucha
W sidlach pajeczyny.
A slonce wysoko, wysoko
Swieci pilotom w oczy,
Ogrzewa niestrudzenie
Zimne, nibieskie przestrzenie.
Czekam na wiatr co roztrwoni
Ciemne, sklebione zaslone,
Stane wtedy na raz
Ze sloncem twarza w twarz.
Czekam na wiatr co roztrwoni
Ciemne, sklebione zaslone,
Stane wtedy na raz
Ze sloncem twarza w twarz.
Ulice mglami spowite
Tona w slepych kaluzach.
Przez okno patrze znuzona,
Z tesknota mysle o burzy...
A slonce wysoko, wysoko
Swieci pilotom w oczy,
Ogrzewa niestrudzenie
Zimne, nibieskie przestrzenie.

Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees

Pastoral scene of the gallant south
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh

For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop",Strange Fruit

fruit down from the tree

Can you see it
Can you feel it
Do you want it
Can`t you smell it
Almost taste it
Are you hungry oh oh oh

Let go of innocence or hold
on to your pride

The day is new
The sun is shinin' down
You know life is good
We got each other
And that's all we need
 
Hey! It's okay
We can paint the world bright, any color
Yeah, coming back from nowhere or on the way
 
Don't be affraid
Just be happy that we're not our mothers
Slavin' over papa all night and day
 
The future is the future
Que sera sera
We can make some sense of it all
When we get old
Let's do somethin' stupid
 
Life is a real gas
If you take the time to notice
Let's live it right now
'Cause no one can live it for us
We got the time
The weather's fine
The world is spinnin' round
You know life is good
In it together always
You and me

Telling me he wants to show me around
He knows somebody with a fancy house
On the playlist, soon to be famous
He took me to the beach, I was thinking of you
Standing in his room but I was thinking of you

the dreams I dreamed went up in smoke.
They didn't pan out as I had intended; 
I should know how to take a joke.

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.
Grey clouds in sky above have put a blot on my fun. 
I'll try to fly high above for a place in the sun.

I think about a night
When the earth smelled of summer
And the sky was streaked with white
And the soft mist of England
was sleeping on a hill

There are new lovers now
on the same silent hill
Looking on the same blue sea
And I know Tom and I
are a part of them all
And they're all a part of Tom and me

Hello Young lovers whoever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down a street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone
All of my memories happy tonight
I've had a love of my own
I've had a love of my own like yours

I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.

What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse.

The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

And a million blazing taxis raising a roar

Down in the depths on the ninetieth floor.
While the crowds at El Morocco punish the parquet
And at '21' the couples clamor for more**
I'm deserted and depressed
In my regal eagle nest
Down in the depths on the ninetieth floor.
When the only one you wanted wants another
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?

Has a perfectly good love life

Hope you don't think it's a breach
Of recognized etiquette,
(I'm from Connecticut!)
You see the state I'm in,
I mean I'm in a mess!
What was that speech?
Oh yes, yes!

I like the likes of you,
I like the things you do,
I mean I like the likes of you!

I like you're eyes of blue,
I think they're blue, don't you?
I mean I like your eyes of blue!

Oh dear, if I could only say what I mean,
I mean if I could mean what I say,
That is, I mean to say that I mean to say that,

I like the likes of you,
You're looks are pure de-luxe,
Looks like I like the likes of you!

Oh dear, if I could only say what I mean,
I mean if I could mean what I say,
That is, I mean to say that I mean to say that,

I like the likes of you,

Looks like I like the likes of you!",I Like the Likes of You
Mabel Mercer,"Though hope is low, I'm aglow when you smile at me
Life is simple as ABC
Not a thought in my head
Not a care in the world

Though skies are gray, I'm as gay as a Disney cow
Not a wrinkle upon my brow
Not a thought in my head
Not a care in the world

I view this scene like the old queen of Russia
Like Kate the Great used to state long ago, ""Merci beaux""

So if I move in the groove with a giddy trot
I'm just trottin' because I've got
Not a bean in my pot
Not a care in the world",Not a Care in the World
Mabel Mercer,"Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine",The Best Is Yet to Come
Mabel Mercer,"Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and they snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
And you leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love
Really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

Oh but now old friends they're acting strange
And they shake their heads
And they tell me that I've changed
Well something's lost but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life
I really don't know life at all",Both Sides Now
Mabel Mercer,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

But you got somebody else that you're thinking of

Mac,"Intro:
What them niggas in here wanted to know
They done made beef with one of the realest niggas rollin
Now it's time to go

Verse 1:
Now pump me up so all them real niggaz can feel me
I told y'all what I represent and that's until they kill me
Why these niggas play with me I guess I never know the answer
Well beefin with Mac is like sleepin with lung cancer
You know you gon die, you don't know where
You don't know when, you don't know nothin
But that nigga was camoflauged with a mac 10
I remember y'all faces, I remember the days I remember the times
I remember I was in the mall and this nigga just wasn't respectin my 
mind
I knew the nigga he was with and the nigga he was with was tellin him 
chill
This nigga continued, this nigga couldn't be for real
I never said a word, cause TRU niggas don't be yappin
He must take me for some kind of hoe, cause I be rappin
I look in his eyes and seen the daddy was really soft
Either he just full of that shit, or just tryin to get his nuts off
However, whatever, I don't give a fuck, you done played with the big 
chief
Now asks yourself, do you really want to sleep nigga

Chorus: 2X
We got beef
All my niggas gon ride tonight
We got beef
Somebody's gon die tonight
We got beef
Don't even sleep
Soon as I leave the studio, I'll be headed to your street nigga

Verse 2:
I was by my potnahs house peepin out these beats that he made
Just chillin, free stylin, just thinkin about some ways to get paid
Some new nigga he came around and I never met him
Get close to me, I don't even know why these niggas let him
For some strange reason, he never looked me in my eyes
When he spoke he ducked his head, or just yapped to one of them other 
guys
And we was outside talkin, I was lettin him peep out my new weapon
I walked away for one second, when I came back he started steppin
Look, I thought nothin of it, I just continued to yap and talk
But when I went to go get my shit, I had realized my shit had walked
What the fuck?  Who the fuck got a ride?  Look show me his spot
If I see this nigga with my shit, this nigga gon get got
But the Lord must love the wicked too, cause I had never seen his face
But you best believe when I catch him, him and my bullets they gon 
embrace
Forgive me for my anger, I'm a product of the streets
And I was taught that you never ever ever sleep with beef, peace

Chorus

Outro:
We got beef
When you beefin with them No Limit niggas, it's like beefin with me
When you beefin with Master P nigga, that's like beefin with me
When you beefin with the Shocker, that's like beefin with me
Nigga, when you beefin with see-Murder, that's like beefin with me
When you beefin with any nigga on the tank, that's like beefin with me
And you know what I do to niggas that beef with me
I cook 'em nigga",Beef
Mac,"This here a true story about ghetto love 
This shit that happened to a young nigga like Mac ya heard me 
Check it 

I met you at a fast food spot with your sista 
Lookin' at my lips like you wanted me to kiss ya 
Told me your name And I told you Mac 
We exchanged phone number...Like that 
Off top you told me that you had a man 
But we can talk but that's as far as it go and I said I understand 
Even though I wanted you and you knew 
I was waiting for this nigga to slip up so you can be my boo 
I had a wet dream I fucked you and you screamed my name 
But when I woke up, all I had was some nut stains 
Your baby daddy was useless and abusive 
But me I treat you like you was exclusive 
And even though he gave you drama 
Long as y'all was together you didn't holla
And you knew I was clockin' dollas 
I was mad but it kinda turned me on in fact 
If I was your nigga I guess the next nigga would feel that 

[Chorus: ] 
The pussy was just callin' me, keeps callin' me 
Every night I had to stop myself from fallin' g 
Its like the pussy was just callin' me, keeps callin' me 
Every night I had to stop it diggin' in my pocket 
Its like the pussy was just callin' me, keeps callin me 
Every night I had to stop myself from fallin, g Callin me callin me 
Its like the pussy was just callin' me, keeps callin me 
Every night I had to stop it diggin' in my pocket, Callin me callin me 

[Phone rings] 

[Mac] Hello? 
[Peaches] Hey baby how you doin'? 
[Mac] Who dis is? 
[Peaches] This me 
[Mac] Oooohhh baby what's up? 
[Peaches] Hey I was jus... 
[Mac] what's happenin'? 
[Peaches} I was just wondering if you were coming over tonight? 
[Mac] Well I don't know ya dig. I got studio time all night a shit and I 
got a flight in the morning 
[Peaches] Plleeeasssee? Mac I miss you 
[Mac] All right I'm on my way 
[Mac]The first time I hit the cat I ain't know how to act 
It was callin' me back 
[Peaches]mmmm Mac 

Momma told you was no good but you fucked me so good 
I rushin' home from studio session to meet you where ever, no questions 
Tellin' my niggas ""I'm a holla at ya"" 
This camouflage love every other night got me missin' flights 
You started stressin' me 
And you start depressing me 
But before I could leave you alone you start undressing 
And I remember seeing Hickies on your neck 
They wasn't mine I was in Cali on the movie set, baby girl 
what about respect you said you love me when I'm up in them guts 
We tend to say strange thangs when we caught up in them ???
My nigga Fiend was tellin' me you don't deserve me 
But a niggas gone do what he want to do ya heard me 
I'm a let this go by saying you'll always be apart of me 
I just can't answer you when that pussy call me 

[Chorus: ]

And it was like the pussy was just callin' me nigga 
You know what I'm sayin'? 
Real niggas feel me",Callin' Me

[Mac--Verse 1] 



To make this million I'm bound to left uptown to go get it 

Once I get it, I'm a split it with those who I'm committed 

Like who, my nigga Wop, my girl Storm and the rest of my click 

Everybody else be on some oh you ballin now (you ballin now) 

Since you play me closer, I'm a get the toast, oh mark my word 

Fuck em, fuck em if they don't know what's happen my rap 

If a nigga know me, he don't know me no more 

Cause I don't hang in the same streets no more, I gotta condo 

I lay low, chill, stay away from shit that get niggas killed 

Call me fake then my niggas will say that's trill 

Check it, funny high hoes be calling me jiggy now 

Cause I gotta little jingle, mingle with the finest and sport diamonds 

When I was broke I was skinny and full of shit 

Now it ain't nothin for me to pull a bitch 

I scratch off and I hear them hoes say he did that 

Every bitch I fuck be saying I'm tryin to have your kid Mac 

I ain't with that

Can I ball y'all or do they want to see me crawl

I'm a try my best not to let these niggas bring me out there 

They know you beefing with the ????, and them niggas don't care 

Who they kill, and tryin to be a millionare on the real 

But I can't a from with that foolishness so I'm a chill 

And just pass through the projects that I used to roam in 

Tote the black and the steel chrome and holler at trill 

niggas like Jim Stone and 

No more hangin, no more slangin pearls and crack pieces 

No more fucking dog bitches carryin deadly deseases 

They burn your dick off, givin you aids through the rubber 

I had to settle down with a boss bitch and now that's my lover 

She down for a nigga 

And when the situation gets heavy she lets loose rounds for a nigga 

And if I don't come home she'll come blood hound for a nigga 

That's the type of bitch I need, no drink, no smoke, no weed 

Hoes label me a hot boy cause I just come home and I don't get D'd 

But I'm a boss baby, I like to floss baby 

Can I ball y'all, can I ball

Now Soulja Slim, my nigga, my nerve, my partner, my wootay,

My ace, my dog, I was down even when you was on that ground 

You camoflauged uptown that was some shit to see 

So when they locked you up I continue the legacy 

Now all these niggas claiming Soulja is you bout that ball 

Would you die for me if a nigga pull up in that tinted car 

I think you niggas sitting around waiting on my fall 

Let a nigga ball, nigga let a nigga ball 



[Chorus] 



Can I ball y'all or do they want to see me crawl 

Man fuck all y'all, if y'all was waiting on my fall 

Can I ball niggas or do they want to see me crawl 

Man fuck y'all niggas, if y'all was waiting on my fall

Fakin it with videos, with pretty hoe's and limos
But callin No Limit tryin submit them fuckin demos
Fake ass niggas be hollin ""keep it real""
I got family nigga, Keep it real to them god damn bills
I give a fuck, bout hip-hop the culture of the call
This shit is watered down like a scene from Jaws
I done been through all the phases, 
Tampered with all the styles,
Niggas done soldier hated,

Tell them niggas in back with semi-autos
You dis me on wax, you might not see tomorrow
I'm like Zorro, I mark D.F.M on they back
[And what's that] That mean don't Fuck wit Mac
They should've told you I was nothing nice
As a matter of fact they should've told you I was nothing nice twice
My rollie was dipped in ice, my g-ride was payed out
Crib was laid out before my record was out
Most of y'all go gold and never see a bank roll
A hundred g's in the hole cause you sold your soul
when your broke, your yellin at TRU to hip-hop shit
I'm known damn well all you niggas tryin to get rich
East, west, middle, south nigga we all the same
We all speak the same shit but with different type of slang
So the next nigga talk about we country and weak
I hope his momma catch cancer and die in her sleep

I'm bout to let these old bitch ass niggaz know I got a game in my vein

Verse 1:  Mac
Murda murda I wrote it in braile
Uncut, lyrical dope, certified by my scale
The homicide rapper, there'll never be another after
The Mac's rapture, I represent, that's what I'm on the map for
Who the fuck gonna fuck with the scandalous
1-8-7 on these mothafuckin amateurs of rap
Feel the wrath of a nigga who bust
Makin my clique the shit, bitches want to discuss
?Platonic?, the lyrical killins don't got no motives
In this, in my vein, ain't no way I can control it
When this inside of me is as deadly as them niggas
You know the ones who killed them boys and dumped the body in the river
I enter the place, ski mask covered my face
If they pass me the mic, I'm gonna catch a case
In this mothafucka ya heard of me

I was born in it and represented
The sinister words of murder was the sons of bitches who was wit it
Never die, my motto, fatigue my sheet
Big Wise that's my nigga, Psycho Ward is my clique
Affiliated with cash, got my foot on the gas
Tailgatin real fast, through my sun roof my verbal gun shoot
Them scriptures, paint the pictures
We believe was cops tryin to catch me like receivers
Scream my name, to all these bitches who be hard to tame
Momma said it's a shame, poppa gave me the game
Experience a soldier, my heart pumps battle fluid
You want to go to war let's get to it
Mac-a-don, put you on teflon style of murder
Deadly as the killer kyle in your hamburger
Till they bury me black, wrapped up in street camo
I rock the microphone strapped off with street ammo

Verse 3:  Mac
I'm the bad nigga from the bricks
Blood on my kicks
Camoflauged niggas never die, we drop hits
I spit the gospel, to all of my mothafuckin apostles
Mac as potent as the coke snortin in your nostrils
I minister, words of a mothafuckin sinister
Transform into Liu Kang and finish ya
Nigga put me in the game I'ma show you my sports
Witness the street level on the be	-ball court
Bitch I'ma die wit it, cause it's a part of my vein
Hear that word camoflauge when you hear my name
So tell them niggas I'm back affiliated, enemy lines are penetrated
My niggas wit me
You cook me up, put me in the pipe, hit me

I remember way back in my project days 

A little dirty motherfucker dreaming bout a pair of j's 

Left alone in this world of crime 

Five kids no daddy and my big brother doing time 

Now what the fuck I'm I supposed to do 

I said give it up to the niggas with the smaller crew 

I guess this thug shit is in my blood 

Started smoking weed, got my first hit from my nigga 'cause 

Me and my bitch we used to cut classes 

And me Silkk caught our first charges, grand theft and trespassing 

I never thought that I would make it out the ghetto 

A young nigga living like the motherfucking goodfellas 

I wear gun like it was part of my clothes 

With them rocks in my socks, running from the po po 

>From the block to the motherfucking penitentiaries

I remember Mac, (Who?) 

The neighborhood nigga who rapped 

Little skinny motherfucker used to get punched and slapped 

Little timid motherfucker never had an older brother 

Alone in the street I learned rules of the ghetto 

I was scared to die 

Junior high running from them niggas on that other side 

Who was opening fire 

Couldn't tell mom's, couldn't tell pop's 

That was the very night I became shell shocked(wooo) 

Paranoid, I used to steal and borrow 

You gotta respect how I sport the same outfit today and tomorrow 

Hand me downs in my closet, roaches in my bed 

I couldn't sleep to hard cause one might crawl up in my head 

Went to school for the fool, fuck a teacher 

Mama gave her last 20 dollars to the preacher 

Rap wasn't paying the bills 

And that's real 

Now I scream murder, murder, kill, kill nigga

My nigga KL he ain't loving them hoes
My nigga Cult definitely ain't loving them hoes
y'all what's up with this Mac nigga feel it

To all the bitches hoes and all that shit
Running around with them tights on trying to find them tricks
Running behind that dick chasing niggas with brand names
I see you tight coming you making it harder for the right woman
Off in the club giving rappers a hug
Trying to get some love letting them put their hands on your glove
Off in the limo you and that slim hoe
They hit the ass and let their partner and them know
So now you on they demo
They wrote a rhyme about cha
They told the world how they got that out cha
All up in the mouth too you with the groupie route boo
They made you famous your man has got to be your bitch
He saw the video tape and said all man that ain't shit
Instead of ending it he defending it I'll give you that much
Either he lame or your pussy is pure gold with diamond clusters
But he a buster cause everybody fucked you
But he the only one saying he love you 
Woo you's a

But I don't love them hoes hoes hoes hoes

I seen her in the house in blue shaking her ass
Winking her eye at every nigga who passed
Trying to fell that glass put his pants back
The ass fat but you asked backwards
A trip with a simple effect even don't have to
Simple things you be after you caught up in the rapture
Me and my nigga point at you with laughter
But get down or try to understand you world
And what it did to make you such a shallow ass girl
I know you laid with this nigga that you met last night
You fucking him because his white Land Cruiser's looking tight
Stroking telling you that it was love at first sight
But you don't realize that it was love for the night
Now you at the crib crying you sick of all them niggas lying
But you the one that's doing all the lying
Supplying the cat to all the niggas that be trying to mack
On the celia you wants to be real familiar

Now back at the spot where the champagne pop
You in the club corner getting wet in some rain drop
It's common to you so you except it
It's unknown how many niggas you done slept with

Everybody's going trigger happy, wanting to blast
I remember we used to play ball and cut class
Now my niggas sport bulletproofs, clutching their gat
We all headed for hell, my grandmama told me that
Even now I'm going shell shocked, wanting to shoot
I was a little cool nigga to tell you the truth
They put the gats in the ghetto, them rotten motherfuckers
Wanted us to get frusterated and kill one another
Now we all beefing and it won't stop till we all sleeping
Everybody's got to die but why we point the finger at the white man
Nigga it's us killing us late at night man
So now I ask my god, is this the way of the world or just the hood niggas
My auntie said, mac what happend to the good niggas
Am I a fool cause my heart be true
And I give a fuck about you and you
But they don't hear me

You turn around and ride on me

Flowers in the soap saying I felt pain
Through the eyes of the youth I envision your gain
My nigga eric was young when he was caught up in the drama
Them niggas took his life right in front his baby mama
Was that God or the devil, that shit is so deep
It's hard to dig it with a shovel, now we on that other level
That's the tale of the ghetto, never change with the name
It's a constant war, nobody wins, everybody pains
Everywhere they hating
They got me sporting camoflauge when I'm misled, preparing on the armageddon
And everybody to blame for the supplies
To the vibes, little kids they caught up in the crossfires
Is this the way of the world or just the hood niggas
My auntie said, mac what happend to the good niggas
Am I a fool cause my heart be true
And I gave a fuck about you and you

She's a friend, she's a lover, she's a woman, she's a wife.
She's the answered prayer ev'ry lonely man dreams of.
She's a temptress, she's a lady, she's the mother of my baby.
I thank God I'm the lucky man she loves.
 
Sometimes I lie awake and watch her sleeping;
and I just wanna bust and the teardrops fill my eyes.
And I wonder what she'd think if she woke up and caught me weeping; 
'cause daddies and heroes ain't supposed to cry.
The morning always seems to catch us laughing
with the baby in the bed between us, safe and warm.
And I thank the Lord above for all the good times that I'm having
wrapped up in my woman's loving arms. 
She's a friend, she's a lover, she's a woman, she's a wife.
She's the answered prayer ev'ry lonely man dreams of.

And when the load gets heavy on my shoulders;
and I can't keep the pace, and I need a place to hide,
I run home to my own little world and take her in my arms,
and hold her; and I soon forget there's another world outside.

Mac Davis,"On a quiet street
In the city
A littleold man walked along
Shufflin' thru the autumn afternoon
And the autumn leaves reminded him
Another summer's come and gone
He had a lonely night ahead
Waitin' for June

Then among the leaves
Near the orphan's home
A piece of paper caught his eye
And he stooped to pick it up with trembling hands
As he read the childish writing
The old man began to cry
'Cause the words burned inside of him
Like a brand

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you

The old man's eyes searched the orphan's home
And came to rest upon a child
With her nose pressed up against the window pane
And the old man knew he'd found a friend at last
So he waved at her and smiled
And they both knew they'd spend the winter laughing at the rain

And they did spend the winter laughing at the rain
Talkin' thru the trees and exchanging little gifts 
They'd made for each other
The old man would carve toys for the little girl
And she would draw picture for him of beautiful ladies
Surrounded by green trees and sunshine
And they laughed a lot
But then on the first day of June
The little girl ran to the fence to show
The old man a picture she had drawn
But he wasn't there
And somehow the little girl knew he wasn't coming back
So she went back to her little room
Took a crayon, piece of paper and wrote:

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you
","Whoever Finds This, I Love You"
Mac Davis,"She's young and soft and kind
And she deserves a whole lot better
Than a guitar pickin' drifter
Who never gave a tinkers damn
But if lovin' me is what she really wants
I'm gonna let her and I'll do my best
To try and be the man she thinks I am
She makes these little kitten sounds
And trembles when I love her
Makes me feel so big and strong and mean
Whispers that she cannot wait
To be my baby's mother
She's the only glimpse of God I've ever seen
Her momma should have warned her
Never take up with a poet
'Cause a poet travels rocky roads
In search of truth and light
I'm the only blemish on her virgin soul

Tries to run, but he don't get far

I knew down deep in my country soul that I had to get away
Hollywood was a lady in red who danced in my dreams as I tossed in bed
I knew I?d wind up in jail or dead if I have to stay
I thought happiness was Lubbock Texas in my rearview mirror
My mama kept calling me home but I just did not want to hear her
And the vision was getting clearer in my dream
So I let out one night in June stoned on the glow of the Texas moon
Humming an old Buddy Holly tune called Peggy Sue (pretty, pretty Peggy Sue)
With my favorite jeans and a cheap guitar I ran off chasing a distant star
If Buddy Holly could make it that far then I figured I could too
I thought happiness was Lubbock Texas in my rearview mirror
My mama kept calling me home but I just did not want to hear her
And the vision was getting clearer in my dream
But the Hollywood moon didn't smile the same old smile that I?d grown up with
The lady in red just wanted my last dime
And I cried myself to sleep at night too dumb to run too scared to fight
And too proud to admit it at the time
So I got me some gigs on Saturday night not much more than orchestrated fights
I?d come home drunk and I tried to write but the words came out all wrong
Hell bent and bound for a wasted youth too much gin and not enough vermouth
And no one to teach me to seek the truth before I put an end to this song
I still thought happiness was Lubbock Texas in my rearview mirror
My mama kept calling me home but I just could not, would not hear her
And the vision was getting clearer in my dream
Well I thank God each and every day for giving me the music and the words to say
I?d never had made it any other way he was my only friend
Now I sleep a little better each night and when I look in the mirror in the morning light
The man I see was both wrong and right he's going home again
I guessed happiness was Lubbock Texas in my rearview mirror
But now happiness was Lubbock Texas growing nearer and dearer
And the vision was getting clearer in my dream
And I think I finally know just what it means
And when I die you can bury me in Lubbock Texas in my jeans",Texas in My Rear View Mirror

Mac Davis,"""Back a few months ago, I was headlinin' a great big nightclub
And they put me up a couple days early, I came in a couple days early
And they put me up in what they call the ""Star Suite""
Now here I am, headlinin' in one of the biggest nightclubs
In the country and I wake up at eight o'clock in the morning
In this ""Star Suite"" all by myself""

""Awwww""

""Yeah, that's what I said, ""Awwwww.""

""But I did what I've always done, man, to cheer myself up
I picked up my guitar, I sat down and I wrote me a little song
Now this is how it feels to be alone at the top of the hill
Tryin' to figure out why""

But I'm doing the best that I can

I used to have a girlfriend,
But I guess she just couldn't compete,
With all of these love-starved women,
Who keep cowering at my feet
Oh I probably could find me another,
But I guess they're all in awe of me
Who cares?
I never get lonesome
Cause I treasure my own company

You know? Check it out, like this here 



Verse1(Mac Dre) 

As I get to bustin' 

This introduction 

Of mind corruption 

And rhyme seduction 

I steal and fill brains 

With game and mo' thangs 

Like them dope thangs 

And what that hoe brang 

Creep on Crest streets 

Speak on fresh beats 

Hit the motel, and freak on fresh sheets 

And wet sheets, is the end result 

Been killing long cock since ten years old 

See I blend this old-game with this new 

And ain't no telling what a bitch will do 

Now picture you 

In my position 

Steady getting sweated by the opposition 

Could you handle 

All this scandal 

And keep on stepping like boots and sandals 

My handle, is young Mac Dre 

Silky slim, is my A.K.A 

And you know that bay is my rompin' grounds 

I mean stompin' grounds 

But I like the way Rompin' sounds 

So I'ma keep it

And if it ain't down with the romp, I hate it

Chop potatoes with Phillie faders,Knocking niggas with Tre Eights 

But now I 

See my niggas at the spot with the session 

Illegal product 

Then people plotted, rotted with no confessions 

Smith and Wessons 

Demonstrations with Fully Autos, actin' 

Conversations at the lab to keep the trackers trackin' 

Double backin' to the spot where all the money filter 

Keep it on the down low 

You never tell about your scrilla 

On the reala 

I breaks it down in all directions 

It's the Fillmoe players with the O 

and the Crest connection 

All in the session with my folks, You know they got the Dolo 

Hit the gateway tracks, like some fiends in a forward Volvo 

Bought a Bolo 

Seen Kelly, mashed off, and then we hollered 

Trailing Coolio and Mac Dre in a green Impala 

Getting cloudy 

The laboratorys just like a porny 

Got a patient 

Cousin Quinn is making the shit get saramani 

Hella fetti

Niggas will say so 

We hit the strip from San Jose, to Vallejo 

Make more scrilla by the mouth piece 

Non-talking niggas don't know shit about me 

Ignore 'em like bitches

There ain't a hand out 

Like a sore thumb, fake niggas always stand out 

Player hater prayer 

Praying that I buckle everyday 

Ain't worth five cents, or my knuckles to the face 

But my burners ain't feeling no flesh 

If you niggas want to test 

Let it jump and we could put the shit to rest 

You thinking deeply 

But I be on service like a shark 

Consider me that hate, but see I serve you from the heart 

'cause love loves me 

And hate loves me 

So what the fuck you think? 

You can't fuck with me 

You paying dopefiends, to put 'em to work 

But now your money's gettin' low 

While I be getting low with this wicked flow 

You got at me last night 

but I wasn't asking who was bustin' the trigger 

I'm blowing big bomb smoke, yelling ""Nothin' ass nigga"" 

My pimping ain't soft 

I'm taking no losses 

So why the hell do you persist to put me in crosses? 

You thought it was shackles, but then they was ropes 

And now they're spider webs 

I broke on you hoes 

I know what you're doing before you do it 

Got an outside plan, but in the end you're looking stupid 

Huh, yeah 

'Cause Dangerous Dame got 'em riding on the freeway 

Actions speak louder 

I don't fuck with he say-she say 

Think you got game? 

Never could you have it 

You niggas are crying wolf, while I'll be fucking Jessica Rabbit 

Straight trading places 

But fool this ain't no dream 

You was happy as hell when you had me under your infra red beam 



Once again, get low for the East O 

Add a little recipe to the gumbo

Add me 

Mix me up 

Stir me in the pot with these niggas that fix me up 

See, back in '91, Coolio was the shit 

So now we cooking a batch of gumbo and it ain't gonna quit 

My nigga the Bigga Figga, adding that spice so fool it's saucy 

You bitches thinking you'll eat for free, well this shit is costly 

So back up off me 

And recognize the sound is poppin' 

Beause we steadily droppin' dope, like the keys you coppin' 

Mother fuckers, they get to actin foul 

When they know they can't fuck with the style 

Smile punk mother fucker, sucka, hating bustas 

Ain't no friends when it comes to ends, so you can not trust us 

But trust me 

You can not dust me, or try and bust me, dumbo

Mac Dre,"Chorus:
Bitch
Life's a bitch
Life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die
Lifes a bitch and then you die
Lifes a bitch and then you die

It's not often young niggas get a chance 
to enjoy riches in legitimate fashion
So many of us say fuck it get a bucket 
and run up in something and keep smashing
It's all about survival
but jealous rivals make it hard for us to do this
So everybody got a gun but when we was younger 
our only weapon was our two fists
Now who missed the first lesson in life don't be no punk
If you a man have heart be a savage whether you sober or drunk
I seen niggas in the pen getting 
their ass dug out over some hop or a pack of Kamels
But that's the game home boy and every move you make is a gamble
Them squares don't under stand so it takes niggas like me to explain it
I show vengeance violence and hatred because underneath it's so much pain
I ain't no sissy or punk so don't trip when  you see me crying
A nigga just hella mad his partners is dead and his folks keep on dying
My enemys feel the same way they want me dead they think I'm the nigga
that put they partner 6 feet under and left his son with no father figure
I live day by day not giving a fuck and when they ask me why 
I pause for a minute then I reply because lifes a bitch and then you die

(Chorus)

Lifes a bitch then you die nigga
don't want a whole slice just let me taste the pie
They sent me to the pen for five years
for a crime that was never committed
I ain't no bank robber but that five years
had me thinking maybe I should have did it
Do my thoughts deceive me? What a mutherfucker supposed to think 
Locked down trapped looking at four walls a toilet bowl and a sink
ain't that a bitch I've been struggling ever since I could remember
But I stay strong year round from January all the way to December
See I am a hustler I need cash bad as a fat bitch need jogging
So I specialize in three things and that's
Pimping hogging and dogging (thats right)
Half these suckers walking around here fake as three dollar bills
If you with that bullshit don't come around me
I do this for reals not for thrills
I got to watch my back for them suckers that's out to do harm
Got a tattoo of a list full a partners 
that's dead that run all the way down my arm
So If you see me mugging tripping and bugging don't stop and ask me why
A nigga just hella mad because Lifes a bitch and then you die

(Chorus)

I got a crew full of the realest that's deep as the Pittsburgh Steelers
Retired bank robbers ex-dope dealers and adversary killers
Our mission is simple get rich and stay real nigga
So our kids can live fat better then we did when we was little niggas
Life is short you only live once and ain't no telling when your leaving
So I'm going to do it all have a ball
while I'm still living and breathing
See I am a philosopher and my philosophy is this
Don't be no punk young homey if it's worth it take that risk
Anything's possible but nothings for sure
Got to take advantage of all opportunities 
and get your money you know
Love those who love you but don't never let it fuck up your vision 
How much love did your loved ones
have when you was broke or doing time in prison
Stay on your toes don't fuck with hoes before you read them
Watch your back for them rats that set niggas up to keep they freedom
It takes 365 days for the earth to spin one time 
But it only takes one minute
for that guilty verdict when that snitch drops that dime
A damn shame I thought rat heads get nothing but cheddar
But I got partners doing all day with 35 next to that letter
So I'm in trouble unless I bubble So I struggle to keep my peace
Staying money motivated with thoughts of Mike Robinson and D.J. Cee

Mac Dre,"Well let me introduce myself
A young go getter mind locked on havin' wealth
Livin' wild with this thug style, I got these hoes
Tuggin' all on my Avirex clothes
A young brown Mafioso, I put my foot through the door
Infrared light smilin' title, desert eagle 4-4
Layin' Cubans on the floor, 
I send my ghetto troopers to the mother load 
To snatch a bottle of A-1 yo,
I'm hearin' rapid fire through the house
Eternal warfare with heavy weaponry
Me and my soldiers ain't scared,
You get a bullet to the head in trainin' if you don't aim for the head
So I know my young shooters left somebody dead around the corner
Plus got the yola out the trunk bendin' over
Its daytime I can't wait till it turns to night 
Cause that's the time when ghetto stars come out and shine

Quicker than outlaws I draw on haters with glocks and techs
Buckin' at undercover agents dippin' off quick in the lex
That's my trigger finger fuck 'em lets bring the heat to the street
Gave him one to the head and there he dead eternally asleep
Deep in this cold world where there's no love, what the fuck should I do?
People be killin' they family for yola not trustin' in you
But now I'm teachin' you some ackrite 
With forty-fives and flashlights
Fuckin' around with thug niggas
And drug dealers
Manajetuahs and jaguars getting chopped in the drop
Killin' haters that act hard nigga like it or not
Cause it's a hold up, your hands go up real slow
Should've told ya that I'm a soldier who kills hoes
Pullin' no mercy on these busters ain't no callin' the cops
And my nine is comin' to fuck you nigga ballin' or not

I'm off in this shit like Mr. Hanky, Janky, but when it gets stanky
Time to rape fiends, my niggas take G's, make G's, but it ain't free
Pimp niggas laced me when I was a baby, how to slang D
And stained me, a suck ya up nigga lip locked but I can't speak
Now it's crazy, niggas be lazy, imbecilic, milli vanillic, 
Can't speak on it but I feel it, I'm the villain stealin' scrillion
Convo be thrillin' your brain waves get to healin'
Just to reach out and touch you 
train of thought make a killin', Soldiers willin', 
So I do it for thug niggas and drug dealers through the snow and rain
Focused on fetti fuck how it came, steady remain
Paper over hoes, and stay on my toes 
And air these niggas out like sandals, 
Blow 'em out like candles
Handle my business and listen to my theezo
And in this thuggin' category I keep it sharp as a needle
Breathe on busters and bust the tech and make it go blah blah
Funkin' with cops and duckin' the law play boy it won't stop",It Don't Stop

Blow 'em to smithereens like the things I done seen.
In my everyday smoking out ritual, regular ooh thing.

Walking down the street with a gangsta limp and demon jeans.
Me and some squalls, and smile (bling, bling).

Is you silly? Never throw the dubbe away.
Lace no dank when you're blowin? with Dre.
Trying to cope with this stress, so I blow big.
How can the bulletproof vest protect my wig?

Mac Dre,"[ VERSE 1 ]
I been tryin to flip the script and take this rap thing to the next page
But the federalies got me travellin on _Con Air_ like I'm Nicholas Cage
Did 4 years, 4 months in the feds, but couldn't get no peace
Released from the belly of the beast, but the 'ralies put a nigga on a leash
The rules and regulations they inflicted, had me restricted, paroled
Kept me from blowin bomb, knowin and I'm hooked and addicted for sho'
Now how am I to be an MC when I can't get my travel on?
Can't bring no babby home, cause every morning I'm gettin sweated by Babylon
The only way out is to max out and give these fools back they lease
Fuck parole, probation, piss test and supervised release
I'ma bring a calendar, bounce, blow up like Chernobyl
Kirk out and get mobile and do this thing global
Worldwide rompin, stompin in other nations
Blowin bomb with Jamaicans, and sippin Dom with them Haitians
Kickin major flows, have Asian hoes, play the romp, maxin for 'ternity
Kick gravel, travel, see what they know about me in ???

[ CHORUS: Dubee ]
	We be global
	Touch land and that sand over the seas
	Blew off of coco leaves, releasin verbal telekinese
	For sheez, clickulate with players
	Under the stairs, to the Himalayas
	Kinda thick, layer for layer				(2x)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Sometimes I sit and reminisce about life in '87
When I was doin my thug game, brain ten miles higher than heaven
One-track minded, blinded by the game and quick change
Not knowin across the way-way niggas were doin big thangs
And it's a shame, cause before I hit the f-e-d's
I didn't know about them niggas in Cuba and them sisters in Belize
Now I'm curious - is Belizan pussy the bomb?
When they blow, do they hum, and how quick do they come?
Boy, it's time to hit the friendly skies and fly like a seagull
Post up in spots where the pot's good and legal
Eat tacos in Mexico with cats named Flaco
And catch a red-eyed flight the same night to Morocco
Top-nacho, chasin superbad scrilla villains
Then bounce to the Philippines and get mo' head than guillotines
Boy, life ain't nothin but fat checks and head sex
So I'ma get mobile, stay global like FedEx

[ VERSE 3 ]
I was a cell dweller, eatin Top Ramen and sardines
Now it's Taiwanese Japanese cuisine
Barefooted, fitted, sippin on sake
Blow on big hashis while I feast on teriaki
International is how I'm smashin, hoe
A cutthroat nigga that will blast and roll
I took a trip to Queens to see Jazz and Preme
They had a nigga blowin brown, said it wasn't no green
But that ain't no thang, cause in Tacoma
I blew bomb till I was in a coma
And in Seattle my partner Chilly Chill
Got that purple leaf dank that really real
I'm global, boy, I be travellin
Gettin further in the air like a javelin
Chirpitch, kirkitch, finna bounce to San Coy

Step in my shoes
Walk in my shoes
Yeah
Just want you to see things like how I see em
You know
This's for all my niggas out there
Check it out

Bottom bunk, sleepin in a 2 man cell
C.O. at my do', and I'm mad as hell
Punk police cowboy from Texas
Talkin some shit bout servin breakfast
It's 5:15, he must be psycho
Or just plain stupid for thinkin I might go
I cussed him out, he gave me distance
And pressed his body alarm for quick assistance
Now these muthafuckas want to do it the rough way
Five C.O.'s is what it takes to cuff Dre
Straight to the hole, but it ain't no thang
My celly got dank, so I'm cool & The Gang
See the lt. for the disposition
28 days commissary restriction
2 days later back on the main line
Dopefiend's dose, so I go claim mine
25 cartons, now I'm straight
Keep 17, and the homeboys 8
Cop some hop, start back boomin
Got em sendin money on the Western Union
2 fat gramms of that china white
Gon' have these dopefiends tryin to fight
Grabbed 3 cartons to coop some dank
And 5 whole packs for some hoops to drink
Now I'm chillin in my cell lookin out the window
Drinkin pruno, smokin indo
Grabbed my shank, but when I'm finsta bounce
They lock a nigga down for resistance counts
Look at Jack Brooks while I'm waitin
Might even do a little masturbatin
Trippin off that bitch Dominique
I bust one quick while my celly sleep
Doors rack open, now it's time for movement
Goddamn pruno got a nigga too bent
Bounce to the movies with my homies
The title sound good, but the shit was phoney
Damn cigarettes won't let me breathe
Niggas gettin restless, wantin to leave
The lights flash on, quick as fuck
Somebody in the bathroom just got stuck
If he makes it, he'll be lucky
Six inch blade stuck straight in gutry
25 cops rush the spot
Now I got one-time on my jock
Stash my shank underneath the seat
And make sure no blood is on my feet
Punk police want to take me down
They put me on the wall and they shake me down
Now it's back to the block strapless
But I got two mo' in my matress
One mo' time I peep the cops
Fuckin with them boys from Great Street, Watts
I said, ""Punk muthafucka, won't you leave em the hell alone""
Down to the 3rd and got on the telephone
Called my bitch, but she showed me no love
Got on the phone, shot me a cold dove
She said she can't talk, she got a sore throat
But she probably gettin fucked by a sport coat
I'm goin through it

Yeah
y'all real niggas know

Yeah muthafucka
I done been there and back boy
I could tell you the story from rags to riches
How I did time with fags and snitches

One false move, and you could stop thy self

I'm a rockstar, in another band
Plus I'm the man with plan in his hands
Soon we'll all be playing in sand
Cause to my estimations, and these calculations
And all the money I made off the Rompalation
I finna get as many didgets that's on my license plate
And shit on some of these midgets bitch I can't wait

Spittin all this shit that my patnas say is loco
But when I do a ruthless switch them fools just don't know
I might get on my knees and break these fools on the docs
Or should I get my gat and go pull a heist
But everything is fair when a young nigga shoots it
And after all is done all the bullshit is proven
That all niggaz die no matter how much shit they might talk
I'll leave a nigga dead wit his head on the sidewalk
Cause when you in this game the shit is settled 2 rounds
So somehow rob a bank to get that dollars on
And some still ask me why I keep my gang mentality
How could I not with 23 in back a me?
At first we was a posse now we is a faculty
I'm stickin to my cutties cause I love em like a family
So when I'm in this shit you don't understand me pal
So shut it down when Mac Mall is comin versatile

Versatile many ways I do ya
I'm never ever frontin so I guess I gotta future
In this rap game a nigga gotta set his goals
And to dump me for these hoes and the ghet' for my foes
Cause niggaz ain't real and only time will tell
So I sticks to my bitch and be about my mail
I havin no time to rap about blue cheese
Just a wackish nigga in yo hood gettin G's
And shit gets sick when ya hit the dope cut
Fiends get beat down and most niggaz come up
When I was young I was told to be about yo money man
But now I'm comin up, these niggaz be actin funny man
I guess its just the jealousy they feel for me I suppose
Man its the shit that make these niggaz act like straight hoes
And you can shut it down, sit back, and think awhile
And stop playa hatin because I'm comin versatile

In 93 Mac Mall ain't trippin off these fellas
Stickin to my raps keepin these mothafuckas jealous
And fools want to know what I'ma say in the next song
Bitches on my dick cause now I gotta microphone in my hand
So now its time for Mall to get his flow on
Kick back, relax, and let this shit go on
Verse after verse I'm makin the suckas weary
And still sessin the most but playa you don't hear me
Shuttin fools down breakin em off somethin vicious

I can't lie, I like to get high and figure-8 when I drive
Blow doja rope in the sky for all my cuddies that died
We can't do nothin but strive during the struggle
You want a silver spoon in your mouth, you gotta hustle
As I take another hit of the spliff that soldiers passin
The only chance I get to feel peace, I gotta have some
So see, I spark the holla a lot, it keeps me goin
Baby boy 3 steps ahead of his death, and mama knowin
So she's sayin, ""Baby, change your ways""
But I was raised in the days of Uzis and A.K.'s
Where killers play their deadly game called the pistol-tag
Just let me live, I ask
But if you're caught in a cross, then I'ma off your ass
Young nigga that's tryin to have the better things in life
He went from crookin and rookin to jookin overnight
Some try to say he ain't right, but who's to say that he's wrong
That's why you're starvin, and the name of this song
Is get some Get Right

I tried to tell my young partner to take a look at his life
But he don't like how it's lookin, because his money ain't right
And gettin high as a kite is his way to escape the ghetto heat
In them streets where it ain't no peace
He's stayin fast on his feet, cause the rollers be chainin
And if they have you with that d, it ain't no use in explainin
Cause they gon' slam you on your face, haul you off with a case
And in the belly of the beast you're straight tucked away
But he don't hear me though, he rather sling the dope
And to that day illegal business got my folks smoked
It got me feelin like it ain't no hope for black males
If you're out there in the life it's either jail or it's hell
See, jail is what they send us to
And hell is what we're livin through

Now back in 1983 we played as kids in the street
Never thought in '96 I'd roll my strip totin heat
And player, funkin with the feds was never fun to me
But man, the rollers try to take the hood from under me
Haters come with jealousy, but they ain't fadin me none
Too busy mackin bout my mail and tryin to make 21
Some of my cuddies didn't live to see the big twump-ace
And I be damned if I got out like a statistic today
So I'ma get some get right, get my game tight
Hustlin on the mic, now my name's in lights
Me and my cuddies was broke, but not no mo', mayn
They down with Cessed Out, so there's no more cocaine
Tryin to show my folks there's way mo'
To life than just bangin and hittin licks and sellin dope
Playboy, it's almost 2000, peep the game's gettin colder
And if somebody asks ya, tell em Mac Mall told ya

Mac Mall,"Now when I just made 12 years old
My mama told me:'Baby boy, you know you gotta be strong
And even though they lead you wrong, stay on the right track
Cause it ain't no get right without some get back.'
Yeah, I heard that, but back then I didn't feel it
Cause I was rollin' do or die, tryna see me a ticket, just kickin'
G-block, I said I'll never leave
Even when the rollers chase me down til I can't breathe
Nigga freeze, who me? Oh, never that!
I'm hittin' fence after fence until I'm chillin' at my doormat
Like a mack I had to get away
Cause I'm a smooth operator, ask Shanda
But the rollers in the V is so shady
If they could, they would plan something on me
But really, them ain't the fools I gotta worry 'bout
Cause white folks goin' loced in the white house
And I doubt a republican or democrate
Gives a fuck about us young inner city blacks
It's a trap, Uncle Sam keeps cursing me
Rather have me in the pen than the university
Yeah, it's a shame but mane, that's how it is
So ya better peep game and try to lace ya kids
Cause it ain't no tellin' what's soon to come
When the punk president might drop the bomb
Got me all stressed out with my brain on numb
My little cousin asking me where dope come from

Chorus:
They try to tell us in the verses and the scriptures
But I guess the real message must have missed us
In '96 all my brothers and my sisters
Is on a mission, we're trippin' livin' senseless
Tell me, will I see the sun in days to come
Will blacks be the victors instead of victims
Or will my people keep killing over fuckin' crumbs
Pushin' dope just to reach ghetto stardom

If you ask Mac Mall who I'm voting for
I say:'Farrakhan' as I'm hittin' the bomb
I .. to the swisher or the dohja spliff
Get elevated to another as I reminisce
About fresh candy paint and peanut butter tops
Young hustlers havin' paper, livin' top notch
And then the D-game straight decline
And all you Sawyer turf niggas makin' headlines
10 o'clock news or America's most
Unsolved mysteries, you better soak some dope
Then the judge starts droppin' the injuries
On all the gangstas, playahs, macks and G's
And you know you won't see 'em  til about 2 thou'
Cause ya boy got washed with a faulty assed trial
But at least one day he gone be free
Some soldiers ain't never gonna see the streets
That's why I keep servin' game over my beats
So all my people, in and out, can straight feel me

Chorus

There is nowhere for me to run
Nowhere for me to hide from reality
But I don't want to be a casualty
Of another tryna smother a brother just cause my salary
And dog, I tell ya that these times' so sick
That my sister's smoking dohja, 8 months pregnant
My brother bubble on the grind and he's way legit
Working on his third strike and he still won't quit
But I can't tell him nuttin' bout a salary job
So in order to get tha paper the boy gotta mob or sob
All will fall to the waistside
While the rollers overlook they want to take lifes
Youngstas they gettin' raised off the T.V.
Got white kids around the country want to be me
And the way they point the finger ain't even shob
Television replace religion, now the gangsta's god
And old folks wonder why we so crazy
90 knuckleheads and 70 high babies
And can't nobody tell me that I'm wrong
Uncle Sam finding ways to fit computer chips in my dome
So I should ask before you slip
See it's higher than the ultimate trip

There was something she took a liking to
I asked her to marry me

Yeah, okay, I wake up with the taste of pussy still in my mouth
Bitch in my bed, homegirl still asleep on the couch
My head is banging like Metallica, swallow a bottle of Advil up
Then head back to the bedroom where she suck me dry like Dracula
It's the young miraculous, mister love-to-grab-his-nuts
Never let a bitch inside, fuck her in the Acura
Aurora borealis with the shine, my aura gorgeous
Dinner with forty courses, bunch of horny whores and fornicate
To formulate a fortune, more in the race of horses I am
My homies got my back, they all Verizon, man
I bring this to you like lalalalala-live man
You gon' need at least five hands to hold my finance
I am fe, fi, fo, fum, the giant
The best thing out of Pittsburgh since Clemente with the Pirates
I tell them ""shhh"" this middle finger sign for silence
Ain't a fuckin' way I'm keeping quiet

Coming to you live inside the crack house
Started with a dub and then I made it to a half ounce
Then I turned it to a pound (Wow), turned that to a house (Wow)
Turned that to a career, how the fuck did I get here?
(Spending all your time just getting high won't drive you crazy, crazy)
I killed the game like Jeffrey Dahmer did the 80's
Speeding down the freeway getting head in my Mercedes
Giving me all of this money was crazy, shoulda known better
No pressure, dope seller, smarter than your professor
Hoes, I don't stress her, put a bitch down like Old Yeller
The flow's stellar, stella ella ola, have you ever been?
Shit I probably could've been the president

No clue what I'm callin' my album
Fans be at my van screamin', callin' me Malcolm
Never knew the outcome be this much cash now
Bank account lookin' like a George Jung stash house
Young and actin' out, the topics that I rap about
Be varying from politics to bitches pullin' asses out

I'm nuttin' in her mouth you tongue kissin' her after
Daughters' moms kinda want me neutered
But they also want the kid to cum right on their cooter
Have the music soundin' better then guitar tuners
Plus I'm doing shows daily call me John Stewart

You cockroach, I'm heroin cause everything I talk is dope
Type to leave it clean and fucking shiny word to Mop and Glo
Tryin' to get a mansion ain't nobody here gonna find my room
Money gonna be green I guarantee you that my socks stay blue
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template

My pen game is something these motherfuckers have never seen
All City Champion everybody is second string
No need to testify (testify) for the best is I (best is I)
And anybody in my way goin' to be left to die

I'm a feed the world you can put it on my tab

Sick bars I've been a boss so stick around and watch it
Did the round, no college campus chilling writing on top of planet Earth

On my own two, fuck whose saying different
Every time I rhyme I get that Punxsutawney feeling
I'm the starter you the fill in
You a martyr I'm just killing
Getting harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin' it and goin' in
Don't call me Malcolm if you didn't fuckin' know me then
And if you lonely girl I could be your only friend

Way above the building, bungee jumpin' down
They say I'm gettin' trendy like I come after a pound sign
Hashtag Mac, this ain't backpack rap
Give a fuck bout what you sayin' after platinum plated plaques
Take it back, cookin' on them hoes, you can make a casserole
Mad that I can rap so well, and everything on factual
Ain't worth it, if not laughable, I'm off the wall as racquetball
Dick that keep your girl awake all night, they call is Adderall
Youngin' on his grind, workin' harder than your dad work

You won't finish in the kitchen, like appliance
Is just a mothafuckin' kid, say my head is gettin' big
No that's my ego, trippin' somewhere where they need a ski-slope

Students run the class, y'all should keep notes

Wake up with some morning wood
Hit it before work, yeah I'm sure she would

Bring the champagne out and the good wine

Spittin' the illest shit that's sicker than syphilis

What, what, goin' hard tonight
Under twenty one, but find me at the bar tonight
Hey, driving round in my car tonight
Making music that ain't hard to like, I got the heart to write

About how you just not happy

'Bout how you used to love me
I keep changing like the leaves, hell
Go, go
You'll be fine on your own, own

She tell me, you an a**hole, superficial douche bag
Wishing that you knew that, you could have these shoes back
All of this perfume back, necklaces and jewels back
All the s*** you buy me
She said, I want you back
I can't be seen again with you and none of your friends
It's so hard to pretend that it's like it was way back when
I thought you used to be the one
I guess you don't have time
'Cause all you do is grind and it's got me losin' my mind
You just don't, don't, don't love me like you used to
Think I'm 'bout to lose you
I'ma end this now before things just confuse you
Kept breakin' promises you said you'd keep
So you can leave a message at the beep

Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails
All going into details
About how you just not happy
And you think you gotta leave so
Go, go
I'll be fine on my own, own
Said baby I got missed calls and e-mails
All going into details
'Bout how you used to love me
I keep changing like the leaves, hell
Go, go
You'll be fine on your own, own",Missed Calls
Mac Miller,"Come and talk shit, who the boss bitch?
Moon the crowd now, Randy Moss shit
Sharks swimmin' in the water you'll get tossed in
And fuck a first class, I'm in the cockpit
It's obnoxious, it's bumpin' out my car
Bass'll shake your dinin' room table from afar
Down the street, they can hear me pretty clearly
Makin' in a night what your daddy pull in yearly
See a little style, I got mine's patent
Always rock smile, never a distraction
Brand new Mercedes, cameras when I back in
Fuck with single ladies, yea I did a little actin'
Love me on the weekend but hate me when I'm workin'
Overly dedicated and overly medicated, for certain
By her a brand new purse and it's gravy
I ain't talkin' Slim when I say these bitches Shady

Chicken sandwiches and turquoise beads
Tattoo sleeve, pair of Levi's jeans
Never get no sleep, you know all about me
Come and meet my team, bitch meet my team, meet my team
You know all about me, come and meet my team
Bitch, meet my team, you know all about me
Come and meet my team

And if you see me, I'll be with my team
Got my homie Billy probably in Supreme
Jimmy or Will be selling shirts to the fans
While TreeJay, Clock, got you raisin' your hands
Then you got Q that's my right-hand man
Shout out Little Dave sittin' shotty in the van
Everyone I came with travel like a gang bitch
City after city, everybody speak our language
We just flex, get bootleg checks
Got all these people askin' what's next
Success and a dumb fresh life
Taking bets, you trying to lose a little money tonight
I'm on top of the stage but under the lights
We, invadin' your crib and fuckin' your wife
So have a ball, no sports, no Spalding
Poppin' champagne, gon' spray it on her awnin'

Chicken sandwiches and turquoise beads
Tattoo sleeve, pair of Levi's jeans
Never get no sleep, you know all about me
Come and meet my team, bitch meet my team, meet my team
You know all about me, come and meet my team
Bitch, meet my team, you know all about me
Come and meet my team

Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours
What happened to that shit you was talkin before?
Meet my team, I ain't tryna meet yours

Mac Miller,"Looks like I wrote this song on paper
First time I did that in like three years
My handwriting is horrible and I can barely read this

Hey, hey, don't even know what's in my head anymore tho
Uh, figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso
Fuckin' girls but I never kept the door closed
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane
I guess it's the result of drugs that enterin' my brain
All of a sudden, every legend keep on mentionin' my name
All that does is show me that my life will never be the same
Police tryna to figure out how to get me locked up
I tell those cops suck dog nuts
Arriving to the party in a chariot
Lookin' for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit
I'm very sick, yes very ill
Eternal Sunshine, Jim Carey feel
At the amusement park scared of heights, Ferris wheel
Double dare me to kill?

Got some soul like De La do, they say I'm new
It's nothing but some deja vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja vu, deja vu

Got some soul like De La do, they say I'm new
It's nothing but some deja vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja vu, deja vu

Wind chimes, sick rhymes, been high on this incline
Tryna get my money stackin' tall, six nine
Have some caviar, sip wine
Sacrifice insanity, sacrifice normal
Purpose is for people in the plural
Form never formal, an art form, not a mural
Work four bars that are tighter than your corn rows
See a girl that's lookin' horny in the fourth row
Ha, I just put it in her mouth, ortho
Dontist, manipulating phonics, put em into sonnets
Let me put you on this nastier than Nas is
Bubonic plague, bacteria that's tryna to find a way
Spread, Like yolk from a broken egg
Talkin' shit? You just diggin' your grave

Got some soul like De La do, they say I'm new
It's nothing but some deja vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja vu, deja vu

Got some soul like De La do, they say I'm new
It's nothing but some deja vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja vu, deja vu

Hypothetically I'm dope, I kick incredibly
Potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy
No methamphetamine's, hot, hundred and ten degrees
Visually stunnin', gotta see it on the LED
When I was seventeen I thought I had it figured out
Now I see what it's about, went in down a different route
It's crucial, three new schools, life with a spoonful
Of sugar, yea I need my medicine
Fuckin' Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president
Represent all these fuckin' people that I never met
Some expect me to be the greatest ever
Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever
Now I'm just a pop sensation, fuck your expectations
I'mma be the best, have some patience
Thought that it was great, then poof!
It was nothing but some deja vu",Of the Soul
Mac Miller,"Everybody wanna ask where I came from
Young kid who bang drums, money don't you worry I'ma make some
Somebody changin' the world, it only takes one
Never scared of death, but I ain't ready for that day to come
A million people in the world, I don't hate one
Even them dumies robbin' people with some fake guns
Make mistakes young boy, that's just what I heard
And you don't ever figure what you don't want at first
I got another verse, invincible and nothin' hurts
A hundred words coming up with what'll have your bubble burst
We can just fuck, you don't need to take my number first
Gettin' right to it, I ain't really tryna cuddle first
I used to try everything with her, and nothin' worked
Got her backwards like she heard the thunder first
These are the days of our lives, and I ain't lyin' kid
Bein' free, tell me what kind of crime that is
It said it can't let me spit a couple sentences
Always good penmanship, make sure you all remember this
You just entered into Blue Slide Park
The place where dreams comin' true, that's where you find heart
Up until the sun come up, yeah my crew grind hard
See me out throughout the day, but you won't find me in the dark
Say I'm smart with remarks, such remarkable bars
Who knew this music would get me a couple cars
That just sit in park 'cause I'm out somewhere travelin'
Mackin' on the preschool honeys, you were somewhere tattlin'
Mad 'cause been known to always spaz again
Every single track with him, Oh he's just so talented
Dream of countin' money 'til my fingers get some calluses
King with many palaces, a fuckin' golden fork to eat my salad with
I observe, asking what did he design
I see an artificial future for a digital mind
Muhammad Ali, yeah I'm him in his prime
Just that normal kid in class who was sittin' behind
Didn't really pay attention though I'm spittin' his rhymes
But now you see his car, tryin' gettin' inside
No. Hell no
I wanna go back home

Late night can't remember what the day's like
Reminiscin' on stop signs and brake lights
Cause it seems that I'm always on the move
When they gonna let me back home
I wanna go back home
I wanna go back home",One Last Thing
Mac Miller,"Hey, ten thousand dollar hands, million dollar plan
My fam's still the only people that really know me for who I am
Damn, got me askin' when I got this fly
The type to change because of fame, I'm just not that guy
Still sippin' on my forty when the cops drove by
When I go, gotta tell my girl to stop, don't cry
See, I-I-I been buyin' these diamonds
All designer clothes and a Benz just to drive in
Autograph signin' must've got to my head
F*** that, I've been the same lil' muf***a'
Always down to share my s***, melody with snare kick
So I don't give a f*** about some lames I rode the ferry with
My larynx is imperative to live, music's what I need, boy
Destroy all of these fake me's, they decoys
Everywhere I go, these companies give me free toys
These random strangers just treatin' me like weed? boys

Pennsylvania nights, nine thirty flights
Thinking to myself, where does all this go?
No time to care, got more I can share
By now, this life is all I know
So this is all I know, this is all I know
Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight
Hey, bulls***'s always gonna be bulls***
So make a toast to the good life

Hey, hey, ten thousand dollar hands, billion dollar plan
Listenin' to jams while I'm sittin' in my van
This is who I am, wrote these lyrics on my D-N-A code
Happy as hell, M-D-M-A, yo!
F*** a job, there ain't no one that I call my boss
We just tryna work so we can blow up like a Molotov
And it kinda wake me up like a coffee shop
Thinkin' 'bout my people who was murdered in the Holocaust
Got me thankful just for life by itself
And there's way more people here I should be tryna to help
Am I wrong for spendin' money how I do, probably yes
It's just funny old people see the logo on my chest
You got ya thumb held high, we can be friends
Other people pretend, we hang out on the weekends
These f***ers lil' bit creepy, so we just leave them
Say get some rest, when I die, I'ma sleep in

Pennsylvania nights, nine thirty flights

Mac Miller,"Yeah, Ha ha ha ha ha
I think I see where you're goin' with this one E

Hey, hey, been around the world and back, yeah I did that
Still kick raps that cause impact, so where’s my kids at?
These muthafuckas hatin', soundin' funnier than Sinbad
I'm ill as the pills that they give you when you collapse
This, that, the other, kiss your mother with that mouth?
We the assholes that she warned you about
We just storm in your house open doors through a cloud
Got an assortment of styles, just be sure that it's wild
Six thirty in the mornin' and there still ain't signs of slowin' down
Twin sisters gettin' wasted so they both are down
It's goin' down, I thought I told you man
If you tryna to party let me see you raise your hand

There's a party on fifth ave, hit me if you tryna go
I can be there in like twenty
I'mma honk it and come runnin', cause we gotta hit the road
Make you sure you gotta clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes
We're just about there you choose
There's a party on fifth ave tonight
And that's what I'm tryna do

Hey, what's the difference between me and you?
When no one believe in you, I'm flyer than beetle juice
Don't count on the sheep to snooze, I'm fucked up off weed and booze
I party then sleep til noon, what every day people do
So haters see me improve just give me a week or two
See when you read the news, my bitches all sleepin' nude
My rhyme talent is why, my album is fly
Your favourite record, you gonna put it aside
This that old school shit soundin' good in the ride
And fuck ten, I'm only countin' to nine
Said this that old school shit, soundin' good in the ride
So let's head out to the party, I'll drive

There's a party on fifth ave, hit me if you tryna go

Hope the neighbours don't mind us gettin' loud
Homies to the left, all the ladies to the right
We came to get down, we gonna do that now

My light up shoes on, my light up shoes on
My light up shoes on
They love the way my kicks flash
This ain't a time to just sit back
Cause, there's a party on fifth ave

There's a party on fifth ave, hit me if you tryna go
I can be there in like twenty
I'mma honk it and come runnin', cause we gotta hit the road

Mac Miller,"I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'mma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', Imma smile back, smile back

Tell them haters call your army, bring your tanks, I'mma big boy with a big boy bank
Self-employed, independent, once you start, don't take no breaks
Work until I get it, I bet it's gon take a second
But once I start up my engine I'm gone, too fast to catch him
I'm Lennon mixed up with UGK, maybe try that purple drink
What I'm on is strong, yours weaker than seven days
Sweeter than creme brulee, presidential head of state
Dopest mothafucka since before I hit the seventh grade
Elevate, who the shit, cooler than what coolest is
Slick without no lubricant, bullshit, you just full of it
Stupid bitch, keep on hatin', I'mma keep on doin' it
Spend a day as me, boy you couldn't get the shoes to fit

I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be

Used to tell me I was fake, they would hate, now they on my dick
Most dope is my family, have respect for my conglomerate
Rollie on my wrist, I ain't rich, but I'm still coppin' shit
Jerm is on the beat, he got that heat, hold up, drop it quick
And bring it back
I could change the world with just a single track
Underage table in the back, smokin', drinkin' yak
Pittsburgh, let me show the world just where my city at
On the map, illest city out, I guess that's just a fact
I'mma live in Rome, drink Patron and have a ball
After all, only get one life, so there's no time to stall
I'mma do it, stupid dudes with all exclusive shit to move with
Just a few kids tryna bullshit, still with my boys I straight up grew with

I just be like fuck you, what you need?

Not really doin' shit, a couple million in the bank
I'm workin' all the time, never gettin' me a break
But fuck it that's fine, not a minute go to waste
I just want to be a legend. Every second I gotta be goin' in
A part of me wanna chill, but part of me wanna win
No college payin' my bills, I'm sayin' just what I feel
Cause haters be lookin' stupid, when you just keepin' it real
I got too much on my mind to care about the internet bullshit
But the people comin' up say I'm forgettin' who I am
Just because they ran into someone I went to school with
I'm cool with it, chillin' with some buddah smoke
I always do it big like a Jewish nose
Cadillacs, I'm tryna to get a few of those
Fuck stress, everything'll be okay

How did you know
I was feeling so under the weather

If you don't mind, progress your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
And they say they love you, but they kiddin'
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don't mind, progress your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay

Do you believe in fairy tales, dreams come true? One day you gone make it
If they gave you hand out, and you were down bad, would you take it?
I found that bein' famous in reality, well it ain't shit
Cause you could have the world in the palm of your hand
But it don't mean a thing 'til you change it
Listen, baby, I'ma be great now
We can watch a movie, fuck it, stay up late
I'ma make my way to the top, every day I get closer
When I was young they told me to wait until I'm older
They turned a cold shoulder to me
And now they want tickets to my shows for the free
""Hey Mac, can I take a pic? Can I have an autograph?""
Bitch suck my dick

You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget
When you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothing when you stop and just say fuck it
Cause you walking out in public and you hear 'em talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch, somewhere get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do

And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah the party never ran, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a hoe before me, then she better be a ten
I ain't picky but these girls be acting tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly
But I take over the World when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit

Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see, Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
'Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna to make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney boy, my family Proud
Make 'em say ""ow"", make 'em say ""oh""
The hoes that tell me ""yes"", the same ones that tell you ""no""
Woah, I ain't just an Average Joe
Lemme hear y'all sing this shit with me, you ready? Let's go

No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek (sing, sing)
And I ain't going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This 'gon be the best day ever

If it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half insane and with the lames I see you hatin'
But there's nothing' that you're changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin'
I'll be in another zone, move out my mother's home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Found a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Lemme hear y'all sing this shit

No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet (I can't hear y'all!)
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek (I can't hear y'all!)

If a car about to hit me, then he ought to beep
Watching Dawson's Creek 'til I fall asleep
It's harder than it seems, I'm under water in my dreams
I’m in awe, this jigsaw, puzzles not complete
I'm just an idea, nothing concrete
Came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines
They tryna change with us, but come to the same difference
Shut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know
My voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
I don't mind those hatin' on my style
I tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low
I'm no God, I don't think that I'm a human, though cause I'm so odd
People sellin' drugs cause they can't find no job
Wonder if Christ made a million off selling the cross
Let bygones be bygones, my mind strong as pythons
The day that I die on will turn me to an icon
Search the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on
The best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan

Asian women love me, I look like David Duchovny
In kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby
In case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me
I ain't nobody, and neither are you
Been contemplating if I even still believe in the truth
I'm so stubborn, I'd rather write my own history book
Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look
All your songs are sixteen's and a hook
We're here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution
I'm down for the movement, trying not to lose it
Jewish Buddhist tryna consume the views of Christianity
Wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup
If it's true, they should hit Alaska in an igloo

Do you feel it?
Don't answer, that was a rhetorical question
Rhetorical (rhetorical)

Forever life been never nice, we expedite the process
And every night I get advice, cause life is way too complex
Heaven's lights are hella bright, ironic how that came to be
But can't you see? This angel speaks
She's saying the place is safe for me
I told ""wait or me,"" the make believer normally disguise
Transform before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs
The morning rises and I'm fast asleep
Somewhere off in the master suite
Having dreams of Latin queens and nasty freaks
My mind, it wonders to places yonder and even farther
When I'm sleep walking I'm Stephen Jobs or I'm Peter Parker
A genius author, a Jesus preaching just to feed his daughter
The weed to spark up, yeah he's a goner, fuck these premadonnas
I'll always wonder what happened 3000 years ago
I like to toy with the idea that we really know
Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?
In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me we are kings

I'm living a blindfold, like where did the time go
I know you hear me out there, can you sign off?
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Baby I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Can you wait girl, so I won't be
Hold you closely, so we don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

I'm just trying to make it all make sense
As you hypothesize on how to monetize, take advantage of
All the time we all behind, get lost in this Aquarium
America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up
We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria
Confessions that I have and curiosity about life and death
Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest
Read about the meaning of dreaming and all its messages
Sedatives that take me to God, witness his fetishes
We all in search for substance, that gives you pain and numbness
Circumstances advance the second chances, for this beloved
I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this coming
But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrows trend
Your life, it all depends on dollars spent and knowledge gained
Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days
Life, it works in such mysterious ways
All these years that I pray, hope you hear what I say

I'm living a blindfold, like where did the time go
I know you hear me out there, can you sign off?
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Baby I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Can you wait girl, so I won't be
Hold you closely, so we don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

Wherever my mind goes
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
I'mma follow you wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

Done being nice, I'm here for your life and all the profits
I'm not your conscience, you nuts? almonds and hagen dazs

Alarming all of these cardinals like I need a pope
Puffing that white smoke, get faded and play the maestro
I'm ice cold, bunny slippers, nice robe
Sneaky bitch stole my rolly last night yo
I might know some dyke hoes who can
Fight though
Walking on a tight rope, underneath a microscope
But close up, we all just molecules and isotopes
What psychic don't know the future?
To live life you kids might, just close your computer
The street lights might blind you though
Make a collage and look at it through a kaleidoscope

There's a bird in the sky
Look at him fly

Clutchin on the pound
I was runnin' round
Life's a motherfuckin joke so we fuck around
Feel like I do this in my sleep
Literally, I do this in my sleep

A little tv money, dollars for sense of humor
Scholar for my attendance like bueller, so no use for a tutor
Some cold brews in the cooler
Coming through in the wood grain pt cruiser, stuntin'
I'm pissed off like a blind person looking for a restroom
Probably be dead soon inhaling cigarette fumes,
Sorry for that blind people comment, that was just rude
And I was raised better, say god bless you
I'm kenny powers, you more of a debbie downer

Hit your sister in the face with a Nerf Ball
I'm dealing with some shit that really don't concern y'all
Punch a fan if you get a fucking word wrong
I'm wavy, get me some shit that you can surf on
Finding me a bitch I can swerve on

Throw some weed, tell her burn one

Now I just want to see Mila Kunis undress
Hope she down for buttsex, it will be a cum fest
Sorry that's some shit I had to confess
Crazy ass bitch doing 911 threats
Came in the game smoking Newport Hundreds
Now I'm at the top and the crown fit
Gold on my outfit
Surrounded by some pussy, I'mma drown in
Got that wet pack, bitch come and give me that
You know we want to know where them titties at
Got 'em gassed, they be asking what I'm cooking with
Have your little brother asking moms where the pussy is

Made a swisher run, crack the 40 then I lit a blunt

Fuck her in the ass every time I'm in a bad mood
Ain't got a choice, know she do it cause she have to
I hit it raw while I'm listening to Papoose
No respect cause you wear a V-neck
I mean stress, pressure that could even make Keith sweat
I wish Narnia was on a GPS
I wish Rihanna was DTF
I got rich with these rap songs
Bought a drug problem, now the cash gone
Album filled with all sad songs
But this the one that I can laugh on

Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em
Girl, shake that body

Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em
Girl, shake that body

Girl, shake that body, them ass and totties
I want to see them cankles at my hotel lobby
Bitch, why you so damn snobby?
Your ass flatter than the back of my head
I bought you dinner now it's time to pay me back with some head
Or I'm a have my little sister beat the back of your head
I'm a grade-A douchebag, I'm a dickhead
Asshole area where my gooch sag
Little momma got salty at me, she started talking tough
So I called the Wolf Gang up, they start to bark it up
Popped a hundred mollies, fixed sherm, think I was sparking up
A bottle of Zima, the beamer, I started parking up
Seen my nigga, Mac, and he hopped in the back
And then we jet to Fatburger, ordered some Big Macs
And bitch came with a gauge, and she wanted my fade
But I'm a bitch-ass nigga so I say

Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em
Girl, shake that body

Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac

Looking for the bitches that love to suck peewee
Herman, I'm a vermin
And you could tell I golf with my hat, man, fuck Thurnis

I'm at IHOP's and eating with Tyler
Drink cocoa then double-team Mariah
But please, don't tell Nick
We were all watching movies at a Motel 6
Like ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
I hope Kendrick fuck Gaga
If Madonna on the Kabbalah
Then me and Snoop could chill and be Rastas
I don't need Prada to show you I'm rich
Pulling out the llama like ""Show me your tits""
Keep crying cause I still ain't over my bitch

Mac Miller,"People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinking about her all the time
I've never seen somebody put together perfectly
What would I have to do to call you mine
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes or you can walk it blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you don't you worry
Listen to me, I'mma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
Never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

So just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away, can you hide away
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange
How the times have changed
But I wish, we could go and be free, once
Baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear-view
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry

And mend a broken heart girl if you can
I don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
And that responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm having some trouble can you give a hand
It seems perfection really is unattainable
Don't even say you about to end it all
Your life precious ain't a need to go and kill yourself
I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top
And, who do you call to make the shootin' stop
And who do you call to give the coup a wash?
After every thing I did I think I'm still myself

So just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away, can you hide away
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange
How the times have changed
But I wish, we could go and be free, once
Baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again

Mac Miller,"Think I can see a fucking halo
About to meet my maker
Brought a double cup of Drano
Some Soda for the flavor uncontrollable behavior
With some psychopathic tendencies
Lonely as your neighbors with the bitches, he got special needs
Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy
My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe
They got my soul, but I don't let them take the rest of me
My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly
And my denim tailored, me and Action rapping
I'll be fucking with the fader, sipping mind eraser
Actually, we rapping for the fuck of it
Taking money from you, gonna smack you out in public
We the republican government, abundance of substance
Having consumption to fuck a bitch
You're Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick
And your bitch looking like Cousin Itt, the ugliest

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty fifth
Just for that sizzle, gore-tex in case of drizzle

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?

Yo, I don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first
After rapping take my people out for octopus
We all deserve a dedication to the fandom
Hold your hand out for nothing if you claim to be my man, damn
You see me peeling off a whip like when your mother strip
Blow the dice, roll them shits, hit another trip
Shit, I'm on some shit
Hand's fucking hotter than a leather in the six in the summertime
Understand I'm only rhyming for this son of mine
And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils
We ate the tuna, it's suede puma, my look is Jay Buhner
Dawggie cause some of us just age sooner
I'm still twisted, rocking lizards from a strange river
Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver
Check the bio, I fixed the game between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio
I been wild

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty fifth
Just for that sizzle, gore-tex in case of drizzle

I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?

Bitch I'm nodding off, I'm hot as wassabi sauce
And constantly giving y'all a bit of this ambiance
I was a minor, chasing after vagina
None of my friends were fake, but none of
My clothes designer
Went from posted on stoops to smoking on roofs
I came from that basement now look at this view
Making this money, blowing it all
Fuck what you did, just show me results

Yo I'm a 635, dip or fly motherfucker
Leather to the foot, horses I lead them to the brook
If you locked, then keep the chisel in the book
I see a lion in the mirror when I look
Look, I lose money but I make it back
I keep it true and ain't no motherfucking faking that
I get a fade and then I fade to black
Bet on the Razorbacks, I hold the multi-colored flavored gat
Blat

I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs

Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
This name say ""crack dealing trap nigga
Slash cap peeler, back with a black stripper
Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker
Too fat to snap zippers""
And half is what I'll do to Mac Miller
Now my minds first track figured
A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixer
Taps slicker than past tiller
Goes around the room like his cats get finna
Oh you Mac Miller?
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture
My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper
Yoohoo, I'm finna murder this brunette bitch
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
A rap figure to look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you Beastie Boy
You can't match your killer with that wigger
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Triller
He got track fillers for a album
If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from
Malcolm, I knock the thoughts off your balcony
King, you're from a home of funny bones
Not like quite the one I've known
You look like, before you punched in flows
You were struckin' blows, bloody nose for your honey row
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
You're a bully's Best Day Ever
With those Nike's on your feet

I hope you're proud of me
Dude I grew to be
Ingenuity influenced by your eulogy
Going through memories
Like they're were movies scenes
I know I've been the shit
All these people fooling me
I'll admit I guess I'm full of myself too
There's just a bunch of shit
I wish i could tell you
This life move's fast, I never knew that
Yours wouldn't have lasted
The dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops
I swear I'll let you know when the pain stops
For now I need to run to to any place the train stops
And everybody wanna talk to me about some business shit
Never really listening, couldn't get real interested
My days get darker, so the haze get sparked up
All this hate, sound the same when my name get brought up
You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up
So I could meet your son and talk you up (Talk you up)

I remember when we were just kids
We knew nothing at all
We'd talk about the life we lived
West Virginia, lost somewhere out in
West Virginia

It's a dark science, when you're friends start dying
Like how could he go, he was part lion
Life goes on, tears all dryed in
Couple years are gon' by, bye then
Can you please tell me help me find my friend
I'll give you anything you need multiplied by ten
I heard he moved to a place where the time don't end
You don't need money, all you got is time to spend
Life is short, don't ever question the lengths
It's cool to cry, don't ever question your strength
I recommend no limits, intricate thought, go ‘head just give it a shot
You'll remember shit you've forgot

'Cause way back then I didn't know shit
And I don't know shit now
And when the whole world is looking hopeless
I'mma still hold shit down

I remember when we were just kids
We knew nothing at all
We'd talk about the life we lived

Light up till the pain gone
All I hear is this same song when the radio came on
Fuck around and get waste dawg
Do this shit till the day I die
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Terrified but my hands are steady
Verify get the camera ready
Carry my own weight all these earthquakes don't wait
Need up from this sleep diving into this cold lake
Fuck all this let that hoe shake telling me I'm her soul-mate
Disguise the emotion no face bull shit with that no thanks
Dealing with her since 08 fucked around I'm done
I heard your suppose to race when you hear the sound of that gun
Now it's losing all of it's fun spending days in solitude
Too many dumb interviews put me in this awful mood
Not thinking logicial getting high jump off the moon
Looked right into his soul when he died right there in the hospital
Peace don't seem possible when the mind is so close
Came in for your money then left with all your hoes

Life moves fast but my baby keeps it slow
Open up your mind and start forgetting what you know (Oh!)
This shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone (Woah!)
You hurt so good
Girl you let it hurt so good

Uh love me love me then trippin' on ignore me
Beautiful to get ugly turn you into a drunky
Still searching for something but I don't know what
Dreaming about nothing wake you up and then fuck
I love it when you get a little nasty
Hit it from the back if you like that wiggle them ass cheeks
Isn't that sweet same shit you did last week
For all the cash you might of stood up and would've walked past me
Wake me up from this bad dream put a match to this gasoline
Every night you somebody different got me thinking it's Halloween
Fucked up can't feel myself work hard might kill myself
Exist through audio where all my problems outwear themselves
Trapped in this wish and well death creeping like sprinter cell
Getting high put my mind away find the words I'm tryna say
I'mma think of that later when the world goes against you
You better get that paper

Prayin' I don't waste it gettin' faded
Cause I'm smoking, till I'm coughin' up tar
Through the surge, energy curve like a lumbar
I don't act hard, still read babar
Trippin' out, lookin' at a bunch of google map stars, shit
They got a app for that

But me, I'm still trapped inside my head I kinda feel like its a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm living paradise, what would I have to worry 'bout?
Dealing with these demons, feel the pressure, find the perfect style
Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form
The difference between love and war inform me I'm above the norm
But, give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts
Rhymin like it's summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven't picked a major label think I'm black balled
I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice
And I don't know what I'm running from, but I'm running still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothing real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fucking deal
Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil
But I want that rolls royce that the homie lennon drove
So, if you ain't talkin' bout some money I'mma send you home
Unconventional, special but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that's lettin me meet these centerfolds
As troubles fill my mind capacity I let them go
If I was johnny depp in blow, I would let it snow
That's just me all wylin out and being extra though
And, if god was a human it'd be yours truly
Watching horror movies with some foreign groupies
Thinking this decor suits me
I do drugs to get more loopy I'm in tune
To ancient jujitsu spirituals it's blissful
Looking out as far as eyes can see
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet
I think I'm jfk's final speech
They try assassinating all of my beliefs
But I'm asleep so whisper to me for some peace of mind
And he be high some weed to grind on top a jesus shrine
Twenty thousand on my watch because I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine
Can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now it's just not the same
I'm looking out the window ashing on the pane I wonder if I lost my way

Don't you ever wanna hide away
Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain
Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today
I'll greet the devil with a smilin' face
Shit, that god fellow may reside in space
As, time's a wasting I'm freebasing with freemasons
My girl's switchin' the locks, the keys keep changin'
Dreamin' of places my own personal creations
If death a party in heaven, I plan to leave wasted

Take some quaaludes, conversate with Jesus
Batting practice with the motherfucking ghost of Babe Ruth
Do as a saint do, turn painful to graceful
Devil on my trails, I'm trying to find the Holy Grail
Right there
And if Mars is the farthest that man has set his target
Then I don't know why I even started
I'm sick of being too nice to people who don't do shit but consume light
Told myself, ""Fuck the world kid, just do what you like""
Go and have a food fight, start yourself a new life

My milk & honey, my Cherie-Cherie Amour
My Cinderella in her carriage by the doorway
Her ruby slipper made the wizard send the scarecrow
And the lion through the forest
To the wicked witch's fortress where she scorched them in the foreplay
Remember that? He said he'd fight the box to see the wizard
When he was visited by Dorothy who came here on a blizzard
Now the whole world's in color, still,
How Auntie Em was next of kin and not her mother
Real, her face was care-worn
I suspected she migrated to Kansas up from Dearborn
And had beef with Mrs. Gulch from the very beginning of Year One
Mr. Candyman, the parables parabolic
The poetry's like the poems and songs of Ecclesiastes
Lightning should strike the stone and then Moses should make a tablet
The Judge will bang the wood up in parliament with the mallet
And yell ""Hear, Hear,"" finally some order to this rap shit
Finally some sort of water to soil these cracked lips
I keep my shit crispy and elegant,
So miss me with the irrelevant, the god body is heaven-sent
The hard-body is reverence, since the son of Byford

Shootin' dice with Jesus Christ, put 20 on the midnight
To everyone to sell me drugs
Don't mix it with that bullshit I hopin' not to join the twenty seven club
Just want the coke dealer house with the velvet rug
Fuck the world there's no one else but us

Everything we think we love
It ain't nothing but a brand name
To everyone but us
Ain't nothing but a brand name, nothing but a brand name
Ask her what she wearing, say it's nothing but a brand name
Baby, this right here is hand made

I got brothers I don't need no friends
My shoes off I'm comfortable, I'm chillin' smokin' weed again
I'm from the berg not the burbs
Investigating my nation, homie we ain't concerned
We're from the 412 out to the 310
We're from the pavement in my basement to 'em yellow brick roads
See, I was on my Ps & Qs like L-M-N-O
But kickin' bitches out my crib, somebody tell 'em to go home, I don't know
I was in the crib with my different shit
Simple livin', I'm a hypocrite
'Cause I'm filthy rich, I got business
Been had wifey's, have mistresses
Been tryna tell you what my vision is, but y'all still ain't listening
The war they winnin', it's just beginnin'
And I've been 'bout Sparta like Michigan
I got stats, they got opinions, I got facts
The bro left home, but he came back
This what raised me, made me rap
PA's baby, I ain't been to PA lately
See, I left and they call me shady
I'm a white rapper, they always call me shady
Got no idea what I'm contemplatin', I guess

It ain't nothing but a brand name
To everyone but us
It ain't nothing but a brand name, nothing but a brand name
Ask her what she wearing, say it's nothing but a brand name
Baby, this right here is hand made

Everyday we love, love
Good morning (La, la, la, la)
Good morning
And everyone but us, us

Mac Miller,"I know it's been a minute since I been awake
Didn't mean to cause you pain, I just needed to escape
They saying that I'm sober, I'm just in a better place
I'm on my way over, I'm just running kind of late
And you know I've been through all the highs
I've seen all the lows
Lost track of time, I'm coming home
You know my mind, places it goes
When it goes, when it goes

It's only a game, don't be afraid
These doors will close, and people change
One day you'll go, right now you're here
No please just hear, don't disappear

Good morning, baby",Doors
Mac Miller,"Yeah, yeah
Let me get a little bit more beat
Yeah

Ask god if she believe in me and will she accept me as a deity
And tell me the secrecy won't keep you free
I'm sleeping, won't dream until the demons leave
I took a nap, I need a tree in the shade
Feel the sharpness of the swords and blades of grass
Picturing the images that make you laugh
I left you out to die but will you take me back
Somewhere in between the crazy and the conscious
She's naked underneath them shadows, let the sunlight undress her slow
I don't know who I am, I'm so good at doing impressions though
I'm going to the festival, the festival need to let me go
I wake up, pop a couple Benadrylls, go back to sleep
So I made up, everything they said was real, it has to be
Cause actually the master fast asleep
And the castles back back in his private quarters
That's a master for you, this a revolution, we don't have no order
All this torture, thought I had to warn you
Leave it all behind and go to California
I'm past the signs, it's the real thing, try analyzing this feeling
You can't fathom

My hands are ahead the clouds
From the clap-clap thunder looking down
While you're running around
I lift you up when you drown
Unlock the mission, the planet in rotation
Full speed chasing and you're always running ahead
You're always running ahead
You got second chances, happy birthday, sweet romances
And you paddle like a duckling, why
Don't wanna go, don't wanna go, don't wanna go to the festival
You got angels, we can see them dripping from the sky
You watch 'em with your third eye
Don't wanna go, don't wanna go, don't wanna go to the festival
To the festival",The Festival
Mac Miller,"So this the music that made white people mad
Yeah, this the shit to blow your speakers out
This the shit you dream about
You can have the world, it's up for grabs
Leave with everything 'cause everything is in the bag

When I was younger, I was just a little wild motherfucker
Tryna be like all the people on television
They had all the bitches that I wanted, all the cars and all the extras
Anything money could buy, they was spending millions
I was tryna get to pimping, I was tryna blow up talking demolition
That boy got the devil in him, swear he need a exorcism
I'm all by myself, got no competition
Keep it real in a world that's filled with politicians
You want to talk about your problems
Don't you wish the life you lived was motherfucking awesome
Don't you wish you had all the pussy, too much money you could spend
You could get away and never see your shitty life again

So this the music that made white people mad
Yeah, this the shit to blow your speakers out
This the shit you dream about
You can have the world, it's up for grabs
Leave with everything 'cause everything is in the bag

We never done with this shit
Here we come with that shit
I ain't stressing, I ain't worried 'bout nothing, don't trip
It's amazing all the shit that I be coming out with
Shit is real, tell 'em chill
Keep on bumping my shit

All my life I been a fuck up, never did anything right
That's why everyday I'm fucked up
My mom pray to Jesus Christ
Asking somebody to save me (Somebody save that boy)
But I'm way too motherfucking crazy (No one can save that boy)
All the kids is doing drugs (Drugs)
They just want to break the law and find someone to fuck
(They wanna find someone to fuck)
Nobody doing as they told (Little bad ass kids)
Everyone out of control (Fuck it, that's just how it is)
I'm self made, dream came true, I'm a miracle
Every time I put my dick inside a bitch, it’s spiritual
Got the whip that say wealthy on my steering wheel
Brand new model bitch made me waffles and some cereal
That's what I call a good morning
Your mom work an extra job just to get you Jordans
Just so you could show up at your school looking fresh and
I don't know 'bout you, but me, I'm important (I'm so gorgeous)
You got money in your pocket, you the shit
You got everything you want and bitches on your dick
A couple grand got you feeling like the man
Everybody walking tall til they trip
They just cut the check, you had to go and cop the whip
Drive up to your ex's crib and tell her she ain't shit
There's just something about the money, make a motherfucker crazy
When I die, bury me in my Mercedes, god damn

So this the music that made white people mad
Yeah, this the shit to blow your speakers out

Mac Miller,"Who's that on the other end of the phone
Didn't hear nothing when I said my hello
Oh well, to hell then we go
So high looking at heaven below
You know me though from coast to coast for smoking dope
Overdose with the holy ghost but hold the phones
I hold my own, was local grown
Been killing that shit since row the boat
Know I'm supposed to hold the throne, be honest
One more drank, I'mma be an alcoholic
I don't wanna think like better unconscious
Need fresh air that thing so toxic
I open coffin doors with a .38 when it's time for war
Told my mama you ain't need no drama
You ain't gotta cry no more

It'll be alright
My mind on the run I won't sleep tonight it's like
When it all goes up in flames who gon hold me down
And I'm the chosen one
Looking all around what has the world become
The only way to change it is to burn it to the ground
I've been getting paid
About four, five bitches in the Escalade, bet it rain
This money feel the same, I'm afraid that I'mma drown

You've never been better than me
From this prison I'm setting them free
Open eyes, I'mma let you see
This world is like our dreams
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
I'm running to the edge
And when I get there best believe that I'mma jump
Jump, jump, to see if I can fly
I wonder if I jump
Do you think that I can fly

It's the life of an entertainer
I need that check go on get the waiter
Fuck a troll, this destruction mode
And these explosions don't need detonators
I met my maker in an elevator, he was headed to the top floor
We're quite similar, we just did our work and we were in it for a lot more
We were trying to change the world but we got bored
When I rip this show, got an encore
Back when we were still in school we didn't listen to the list of rules
Wrote a million words on the chalkboard
I don't need answers to the questions of intangibles
I told my homies the top so lonely but
We're not gonna die not now

You'll make it here, live free tonight till the day appear
Let's sit back right where we at and let this money pile
How do we get rich, if she acting crazy I don't need that bitch
Wish I knew back then all the things that I know now
Go on and on, know I had this shit all along
Take a breath, feel this moment hold it just so you can
Look where we at, look where we came from
When will we wake up, lost in translation

You've never been better than me
From this prison I'm setting them free
Open eyes, I'mma let you see
This world is like our dreams
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
I'm running to the edge
And when I get there best believe that I'mma jump
Jump, jump, to see if I can fly
I wonder if I jump
Do you think that I can fly",Jump
Mac Miller,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me

Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox

You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

How's everybody doing
Just wanna ask a question umm, have you
have you, have you been in love before

You like your vodka with a little touch of lime
You should probably take your heels off
'Cause you've been running through my mind
Oh baby, they say we're no good for each other
And I can't really tell, what is this spell you put me under
Your love's not too kind to me
I hate the pain these days of rain
You're playing games of hide and seek, my love
And I'm still trying to find you
I'm looking for you babe
And I'm still trying to find you
Through sunshine or rain

(I love you)

Yeah, you got your stained glass iris
Diamond behind your eyelids
And though pilot fly
My heart skipped a beat like a scratched CD
Your skin smell like butterscotch and your lips taste like kiwi
Let's take a plane to Fiji, make a date let's take it easy
Love is power, swear there's something about her that make me nervous
Mother earth done gave us all a gift, she made you perfect
Let's eat some mushrooms and go to the circus
Girl you know I'm loving you just like you deserve it
So baby make me earn it, show me the way you work it
Tell me what you afraid of, I'll spit you my favorite verses
Let's just go take a breath
I want it all, every ounce of love that you got left
You are my drug and love to death
Feel free to fall, you are a catch
I'm in your heart, I'm in your dream
So fuck the world it's you and me
She is the only one that got away
If love don't last forever then forever ain't the same, yeah

Your love is not too kind to me
Yeah
The only thing on my mind is she
My love, my love, my love, my love, yeah
And I know that nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever

And she is cool, calm and collected
I knew that you was the one when I seen you leave me breathless
Say okay I need a second day today, give me attention, I
Want to take care of you
Marry you, something I'm prepared to, there can't be two
You was here I ran from you
Scared to take that step
But now that I am ready, you're not
You up and left me
Hope your new man make you laugh like I do
I do not mean to worry you with my obsession
I just want to be beside you, I'm

Too nice, and I had to pay that price
Everything I do is wrong, everything you do is right
Let's start a family, hold on to forever baby
Your pussy is a palace and your head is crazy
That bomb is detonating, look at this mess you're making
I am the king, you are the queen, look at this chess we're playing
Oh we had a love that love was record breaking
I'm sick of waiting

Your love is not too kind to me
Yeah
The only thing on my mind is she
My love, my love, my love, my love, yeah
And I know that nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever

So gimme all your love
And I will be yours, through rain and through shine
Gimme all of your love
You will be mine through rain and through shine

The more you give a fuck, I guess the less you make (Money)
Homie we just out here tryna elevate
Heaven is a crime scene, stand behind the yellow tape
I started making money in eleventh grade
Soon as I learned that the more you do, the less you wait
Got a bigger crib, always use the extra space
Shit was so different in 2008
Growing pains, fill the open veins with Novocain
Relapse, I eat that, I don't complain
I'm just rambling
You want war, this N64 Blitz champion (Sucker)
Out of space channeling, brain damaging
Heavy rain game cancelling, proud to be American
They tell me ""Get yourself straight
How much more money can you make?""

I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
Maybe get married to a local bitch

I stuck around the past six summers
Karma is a bitch and that bitch don't love ya
We was in the attic you could smell the weed
Bitches getting naked, we was selling E
Bitches kissing bitches just like Ellen D
In the kitchen whipping biscuits, giving generously
I thank the lord I made it out, no STD
Lost a few too many brain cells, I'm special needs

It ain't about complaining, it's about maintaining

All we can do is hold onto these memories. Mac miller, I love you

All of my homies used to get on my case like ""when you 'bout kill 'em?""
Soon as I'm out of millions and my girl sprouts some children
But I've been murderin' the game, almost out of victims
This food for thought usually enough to feed a thousand pigeons
I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though
Shit bro, would you give it all up for these Nymphos?
I been broke then got rich, what's inside your wallet?
Half man and half amazin', but that's just me bein' modest
I'm an honest man, my mama told me never put it on the lotto and
I work for everything I get that is my motto, fam
So when I die, these bitches can still can fuck my hologram, god damn

And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive

You can see the way that time flies
Time files, try to catch it
Time flies, time flies
Try to catch it

You can expect the unexpected
These dreams are manifested from my head into reality, they seems a bit excessive, but
I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings
All the times that I've been reckless, with an ego big as Texas, thinkin' ""I'm the man""
I never let these hoes inside the plan
My room for bullshit in the clear as small as a child's hands
I fill the shoes and walk a path where only giants stand
I am the fire man, shit I'm way too fly to land, yeah
I'm smokin' weed all alone, on the road
Even thought I know they need me at home
Keep my control from a city where it's freezin' and cold
Each to their own, punches like this probably beat up Stallone

And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high

Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? (Bullshittin')

Hey, blow out the candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun

In my life time, my whole M.O. was to get this M.O.N.E.Y
I sabotage the wealthy and the rich and the poor (Soul)
Long story short, that's one of my long term goals
My anatomy is platinum, gold is old
Lettin' my hair swing like Pootie Tang
I done seen some spooky things through these Gucci shades
Acute to cute bitches, niggas with drums
Niggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade
But can't we all just get along?
Like Martin Lawrence would say and get along with our day
She say Soulo, you so crazy and deranged
I say I know, roll that weed nigga! (Shake that ass hoe!)
Most dope, Top Dawg off the leash, Sounwave on the beat (Wizzo)
Our Anarchy is our NR key
Your confidence is caca to a kamikaze

In this life time, be the time of your life
It's been a while, but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike
And as a child, I was curious my mind was the dirtiest
Curse words we're probably my first words, affirmative
My home run derby shit, was makin' profit out the park
Even the brightest mind will hang around at dark sometimes
I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize
Had to write my wrongs, the day's short, the night's is long
I'm makin' corpses when it's on
And eatin' swordfish, from gigantic portions
Lord is important, but I am stronger
I'm a monster with the heart of a lion divide and conquer
Walk on water, it won't be long till I flyin', that's my departure
I'm a goner, shootin' down from the sky with the eyes of an archer
What a fine act you got for
I don't know why I get so high for
I'm a problem and as hard as I try hiding from karma
You'd be traumatized seein' what came across these eyes
There was a time

When I was just a kid, dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks

I been having trouble sleeping
Battling these demons

I been thinking about the places that I frequent
All the people that I see
I started livin' decent
But what do it mean to be a G
Only time we fall behind, bitches in the concubine, callin' mine crazy
See in God's desire make water wine, pause in time, it's common they often hate me
Never will I walk in line, I cross the T's and dot the I's
Wondering well, wonderin' how I got this high
Fell and asleep and forgot to die, god damn
I'm poppin' them dollars and drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter, I'm stuck on the browsers like how did I make it
These bitches don't know me, this shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what today is

But I'll be good by the weekend
I'll be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend

Oh

Love
Love, love, love, love (sex)
Love, love, love, love (sex)

This one don't frown when I'm the wrong
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised this all I know
I felt the highs and they felt like you
See a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl I'm so in love with you
Girl I'm so in love with you

Yeah, yeah

Baby you were everything I ever wanted
Bottle, wedding ring it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away
So I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college
I was on the phone, we ain't no talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn
Puppy love ain't what it was darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh
I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargin
Mr. Charmin' that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hemp for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said ""all you ever think about is sex""
I'm like oh well
You know me so well
And if this will make you lay I swear I won't tell
And every time I call your phone you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail
Well I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass what Heaven's like
When I'm in that pussy it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
That's my only chance, I better get it right

Take your time my baby
Cause I'm waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
But yes I'm waitin' right here for you, for you

You get closer with me run away
All I ever know is the color gray
Your loving ways bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine
Heaven probably not the same without you

Hello I would like to tell you about my love affair
With my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other
And find out about each other
We got to know each other little by little living very close in the same building
And he would help me with things and I would see him and think ""what a cute guy""
And he was a cute guy
And it was just little by little we got to know
Just to say hello
One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him
People respected him, and he was good to everybody
He knew people he worked with all adored him
And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody
For me was the most important
Being attracted to him and being, finding people respected him and I respected him
I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were
And I learned to understand and respect
And see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time
So it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together
And our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other
And the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other
After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding
With just family and very close friends
The friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys
And, my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys
And I feel I just gave him a wonderful life
A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too
And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other","God Is Fair, Sexy, Nasty"

Jedi been way too hot for way too long
I'm so exhausted
Whether that's your mind or mine we still get crossed
First your name is gone
Never understand until you have to stand alone
Can I have a mental hold
A band-aid for my damaged soul
I paint the planet gold
I swear it, Michelangelo
I don't understand you so
They didn't want a man when it was man was broke
But now they know me
And I know what I don't need
No Six, no Beamers, no Benz

That's just the way that we are
And when we swim with freaks here we are
I'm takin' care of each and every part
I opened up your legs and go straight for your heart

Voo-voo taste this, taste, taste this

Mac Miller,"You feel like you are alone. You have a soulmate?
Somebody who challenges you
I'm talking about someone who opens up things for you, touches your soul
You can't get back to it, you know
You'll never have that kind of relationship in the world
Right, you'll always afraid to take the first step
'Cause all you see is all the negative things ten miles down the road
You can do anything you want, you are bound my love

Yeah, are you my soulmate, my angel?
What do you want with me?
Too high, slow pace, my eyes closed
Your body all I see
I think you're too, too fine for my human mind
When I'm with you what do you do with me to fly
No matter what, one day everyone dies
You think you are God until you run out of time
Yeah, when you're gone what will you leave behind?
Yeah, do I belong sometime soon, where goes my mind?

You were the one to show me divine love, love, love, love
Where was you when I was lonely, my divine love, love, love?
When the stereo plays our songs, sounds so blue
Baby, where'd you go? What's so wrong? I'm right here

Yeah, why do you stay on my case?
I try to make you feel okay
Do you know I'm in pain?
I get you clothes, you misconstrue
You continue to push me far away
Why don't you come on in?
It's like you forgot my face
I just wanna taste you, everything you're made of
We ain't (nothing)
Cut the strings, might belong, watch me fly
Yeah, when are you coming through to free my mind?
Are you happy with your life?
Can I come and satisfy?
Open up, let me inside
When you take off all your clothes
I'm under your control
Rollin' up, you get me high

You the one to show me divine love, love, love, love
Where was you when I was lovely, my divine love, love, love?

Fatale comme ce drive-by à la sortie d'une rée-soi

J'ai pas besoin de gueuler pour t'mettre un tard-pé sur la tempe
Juste un clap de mains pour mettre fin à ton existence
Du sang sur un linge qui peut coûter la peau du cul
Chacun veut que sa pute aille en SLK chez le pédicure
Un mal-être inexplicable, ça vient de l'entourage
Les efforts combinés des forces de l'ordre n'atténuent par ma rage

Affaire non-classée, mais la rue connait le coupable
Si l'caïd est sous cocaïne, il est facile que le coup parte
Ici les keuf sont tout-par, ne me dis pas que t'as reup
Barricade-toi chez toi et ne fais pas le mec de la rue
Y'a vraiment rien de drôle dans un gramme d'héro'
T'as fais tiep quand j't'ai vu chlaguer dans une bouche de métro
Bouge de ma vue, couches-toi quand on allume
J'ai rencardé Brigitte pour la baiser toute la nuit
Pour les frères en cellule qui rêvent de casser la serrure
10 piges dans les dents, tu réalises que c'est dur
Je lève mon verre aux voyous qui débitent du kilogramme
Je lève mon verre aux frères diplômés, oubliés par l'état

Tu t'es pris pour Brad Pitt mais tu n'es que de la merde
Tu me délaisses pour tes potes comme si c'est eux que tu baises ah
Ok je pense qu'il est temps que tu dégages
Ou c'est moi qui fais mes bagages et qui m'arrache oh la la
Ça déménage dans le ménage
C'est la guéguerre des roses dans l'appart
De part et d'autre personne n'admet ses torts
On se dispute tous les jours sans jamais parler de divorce
Aucun mariage forcé, que de l'amour pur
Quand t'es en mode effort les femmes veulent toujours plus
Tu m'insultes comme si j'étais le pire des salauds
Tu sais que je te trouve belle comme la femme d'un autre
Marre de te laisser gueuler sans dire un mot
J'ai peur de te retrouver dans les bras d'un autre
Putain mais qu'elles sont folles ces femmes
D'avoir brûlé leurs soutifs ça leur monte au crâne
Tujours vénères comme si elles avaient leurs règles
Donc cesse de te leurrer l'heure est au réglement de comptes

T'es qu'un fils de pute tu me fais de la peine
Tu t'es pris pour Brad Pitt mais tu n'es que de la merde
Tu me délaisses pour tes potes comme si c'est eux que tu baises ah
Tu repasses aucune de mes sapes, la même bouffe tous les jours
Dehors toute la journée tu n'attends que mon retour
Non pour faire l'amour mais plutôt faire la guerre
C'est un enfer de ouf quand ma fouffe me prend la tête
Griffe devant la porte, clé dans la serrure
Ouvre-moi bébé désolé d'avoir fait le dur
Là ça fait le canard pour calmer le carnage
Je m'excuse sans savoir pourquoi j'ai perdu la face
Je me sens plus le même devant le miroir
C'est qui l'homme ici ? Elle ou moi ?
Quelle question bizarre
2006 elles nous maquent c'est pas très bon ça
Bientôt les mcs mettront des strings et les meufs des calbars
Festival de cris nocturnes irruption de larmes volcaniques
Sinon c'est la drogue dure ce que l'amour nous procure
C'est de la haine et de l'attention, c'est de la peine et de la passion
Refrain (x2)
T'es qu'un fils de pute tu me fais de la peine
Tu t'es pris pour Brad Pitt mais tu n'es que de la merde
Tu me délaisses pour tes potes comme si c'est eux que tu baises ah
Ya qu'au lit qu'on trouve le temps de parler à nos femmes
Sinon le reste du temps frère, nous sommes à nos armes
Je ne veux pas être un clochard qui n'assume pas ses charges
C'est dans la dispute que l'maour perd de son charme
On a peut-être du mal à rompre quand on ne s'aime plus
Les femmes savent bien qu'un homme c'est pas né dans l'habitude
Putain on va tout de même pas gâcher toute cette année
La vie en couple c'est pouvoir dialoguer sans se fâcher
Mais tu sais que je t'aime, c'est ça, c'est ça
Tu sais que jamais je ne pourrai vivre sans toi
Ce morceau c'est pour les couples qui s'aiment, qui s'engueulent
Qui saignent et qui s'embrassent qui cèdent de belles histoires

T'es qu'un fils de pute tu me fais de la peine
Tu t'es pris pour Brad Pitt mais tu n'es que de la merde
Tu me délaisses pour tes potes comme si c'est eux que tu baises ah
- T'as vu là, tu me comprends chérie là, non !
- J'en n'ai rien à foutre, tu me dis que des sottises depuis tout à l'heure
- Non mais, hé, chérie, là, j'ai pris la peine de t'expliquer,
là tu vas me faire péter un boulon et après faudra pas t'étonner hein?
- Quoi, tu veux me faire quoi, hein, tu veux me faire quoi, dis-moi?

Universal pose les billes, moi je reste vrai
Le showbiz c'est rien pour moi, j'ai l'appétit de Shrek
Dans une cellule de prison à peine plus grande qu'un cercueil
Tu réfléchis sur ta vie pour savoir où ranger ton gun
Le cœur blessé, t'avances quand même sans goûter
Si j'prends l'roro la concurrence dans l'rap sera goute-dé
Plus jamais personne pourra me doubler, plus jamais l'oubli
J'ai pas pu voir ma fille jouer à la poupée
J'suis une caillera, une vraie, j'assume mes actes poto
Plus besoin d'expliquer la définition du logo (Untouchable)
Du mal à accepter qu'une femme puisse s'occuper de moi
Toujours un truc chelou qui me chahute comme le diable
Toujours la vision, toujours la niaque
Comme Underwood j'trouve le pouvoir aphrodisiaque
J'rêve de repos sur une île paradisiaque
Peur de crever dans les bouchons d'une crise cardiaque
Microphone check, vérités sur un boom tchack
J'suis la persévérance qu'attendait le miracle
Quand l'oseille se fait rare, nos actes sont répréhensibles
J'ai passé le 31 décembre tout seul avec mon inspi'
J'ai pas d'amis, très peu d'messages de Bonne Année
Le désespoir est les couloir des cités abandonnées

On est encore loin d'la fin de carrière
Y'a des classiques qu'arrivent encore
Pour moi c'est normal, c'est dans mon sang, c'est dans mes veines
J'ai mis tout mon vécu d'la rue dans la cabine de prise poto, rien d'autre
On a décidé d'être un rappeur aujourd'hui
On a levé l'pied sur ce que, pas trop envie d'parler wAllah
Eh dis-leur Kickos wAllah ils m'traumatisent wAllah
On va les baiser leur mère
Bande de bâtards va
Les rappeurs qui faisaient les thos-my
""Eh So' on t'aime bien, on t'aime bien""
Mais vous savez qu'dans l'business j'étais bloqué
Maintenant j'vous baise bande de bâtards
Y'a pas d'feat dans mon album, j'vous baise
Mon studio il est dans ma cité frère, c'est tout ce que j'ai à dire
Je suis une légende, oui oui",Outro
Mac Tyer,"PAIRE DE REQUINS
Mes requins trainent au studio, mes requins trainent au quartier.
Elles aiment marcher sur les Champs-Élysées.
Engraissent les potes du portier pour une soirée mondaine
À la tess la paire de requins est sur un compet
Pour un contact avec pour une affaire avec des air-force 1
Mes requins n'ont rien d'une paire de westons
Donc elle perd son calme
Quand elle est neuve elle en jette
C'est vrai qu'elle est re-chè mais ca fait plaisir à la p'tite soeur en survet
C'est avec son lacet que le tox fait son garot
À staro elle est toujours au pied d'un accusé dans le box
Usée même cherté on la porte fière d'elle
Mes requins risquent 16 mecs alertent parfois toute les semaines
Echappe parfois aux soins intensifs elle ne passe pas aux aveux
Mes requins avancent avec la grâce de Dieu
Son pire ennemi c'est la chaussure étoilée symbole de l'éternel conflit de la Palestine
Elle est partout, vieille ferraille, gamos également box
Partout parloir café hall dans ta cité
C'est là-bas qu'elle a trouvé sa rage entourée de 180 air max et de u arash
De-spi branchée sur 100.000 volts,
Qu'il pleuve ou qu'il vente la paire de requins vend sa drogue
Frelon, son meilleur poto c la paire de shox requins,
Parce qu'un l'homme est un prédateur pour l'homme
Refrain (x2)
Un grand doigt de vérité sur la paire de air max requin,
C'est celle-là qu'on porte (aime) parce qu'elle coûte chère et qu'elle nous va bien
On vient d'en bas gros et ça tu le vois bien
En caillera dans ma paire de requins
Hé ouais c'est la paire de requin mon pote, même moi je la porte
Celle-ci je la cace-dédi a tous les frères du bon-char
Les requins sont dans les vitrines à nous faire des facies
Elles sont dans les chichas et les cabarets
Piétinent une cigarette dans un bar à you-voi
Mes requins accélèrent les voitures pé-ta
Attirent les motards sur une bécane
Abusent pour nourrir les grosses chiennes aux grandes bottes
La paire de requins c'est les p'tits jeunes et les sistes-gro qui la portent
N'insiste pas trop t'auras les kiss-dé sur écoute
Les requins se privent l'hiver pour aller frimer sur la côte
Comment ça on me dit y a des falches du Maroc
Mes requins sont frais parce qu'elle coûtent grave des euros
Si tes requins trafiquent et qu'elles sont en semi
Attache fort tes lacets pour le jour où tu devras courir
C'est pour les courageux requins noirs virgule argentée
Celles qui font les p le soir pour une nouvelle paire de jantes
Quand c'est chaud mes requins sautent par la fenêtre marchent dans la boue
Pour vè-ski la maison d'arrêt
Mais rien ne l'arrête, mes requins s'en battent les reins
Fait le bonheur des nouveau-nés comme des assassins
En gard'av elles servent de coussin le sommeil profond
Ma paire de requin est libérée sous caution
Elle ne se chie pas dessus même face à 12.000 paires
Sartek cousin si tes requins ont foulé le sol de La Mecque
C'est une classique paire pour les caïds
Et si tu veux faire plaisir c'est un bon cadeau
Refrain (x2)
Un grand doigt de vérité sur la paire de air max requin,
C'est celle-là qu'on porte (aime) parce qu'elle coûte chère et qu'elle nous va bien

Symphonie des fauves en sol majeur

Des traces de ligatures, sur ton rap que j'prends en otage
Entre ma vie d'rue et la zik-mu le rapport est sauvage
Rien qu'on parle de wam depuis qu'mon rap a changé
Tout ce que j'avais; le compte: le benef de ton 100g
Une grosse envie de se venger

La langue est pendue
Comme un Spartiate tu diras de moi que j'me suis bien défendu

Assume tes actes et n'attend pas l'effet papillon
Oui, le béton rêve de grosse sommes
Moins d'pé-ta si l'guetto aurait la matière grise à Grissom
Un ciel gris pour une enfance outragée
Intempéries au coeur du colisée, alcoolisé sont nos flots de larmes
La vie de cité prend des allures à Zé Pequ'
Zig zag entre les bastos
Bla bla dans le buffet
Dans mon cosmos les étoiles ne brillent plus
Le soleil meurt, c'est la lune qui éclaire le bitume
Nique ta grand-mère mon son ne gratte pas l'amitié
J'suis comme Achille de Troie, avec 4 fois moins de pitié
Le fou sur l'échequier
Mon rapgame c'est ton cimetière
La faucheuse dans tes cauchemars qui te sort du sommeil
Au soleil couchant, le vampire sort du château
Présente moi ta rose, et jte sors le char d'assaut
La violence tah Bagdad, trop d'rage dans mon bagage
J'condamne les bords de l'échec par les clous de la victoire
Noir est l'histoire quand tu grandis dans la rue
C'est les ténèbres dans les abysses de ma blessure
Ok j'ai la langue de feu qui vous dérange
Un rap accessible mais rare comme un supercharged orange

Oui, je porte cet uniforme de général
Mais couni muyiamo, dans mon coeur, je suis un homme normal, comme vous!

Mac Tyer,"J'avais tout, j'ai plus rien, aujourd'hui je déprime
Souverain de mon royaume, mon château se détruit
Blessé dans ma chair, je me sens mourir
Vais-je quitter ce bas monde sans profiter de la vie?
Dans une longue insomnie, la nuit, je me questionne
J'écris des textes pour n'étrangler personne
La solitude est mon seul logis
Ne cherche pas à comprendre, plus rien n'est logique
Des gens me croient mauvais, mais je suis bon pourtant
J'ai vu l'amitié se faire flinguer à bout portant
Je suis encore ici à me battre, c'est quand qu'on se barre?
Que je porte mes lles-cou pour vraiment baiser ce monde de bâtard
J'ai pas fini de prendre, pas fini de souffrir
Prendre les sous et fuir comme un dictateur en exil, et oui
Mon reflet dans le miroir, je ne peux plus le blairer
L'amour de ma vie, je n'ai pas su l'aimer
Laissez-moi planer, laissez mes rêves toucher le ciel
Violente frustration, tu refuses de me toucher le zgueg
Univers atroce où les coups de cross se perdent
Si près de mes proches qu'un être cher me fait la guerre
Amertume dans les veines, bitume dans la punchline
Que je viole ou dépucelle ma chance, y'aura du sang sur les draps
Au bled j'ai peur des zincs, comme une paire de skets-ba

Boire un verre au comptoir, je navigue dans le répertoire
Je m'aperçois que les vrais amis se font rares
Au card-pla, on a vu nos mères fondre en larmes

On meurt sans être prévenu. Bref, tu peux mourir tout de suite

Impuissant face au drame du quartier, vécu malsain
Peine de cœur, peine de card-pla, je cherche mon chemin

J'entends des chats miauler, je vois des lions rugir
Sous-estimé ma punchline, m'a fait encore plus vous haïr
Untouchable républica, les faibles deviennent plus forts comme dans le pays du cigare
Laisser-moi toucher vos nibards, je suis en manque de tendresse
Elle m'oppresse la vie de tier-quar, parce que le temps presse
Il y a que l'oseille qui puisse me guérir, comme un Généraliste
Pour du rhaliss dans les rues de ma ville, la kalash fait du bruit
Rien qu'on Grapille, Rien qu'on est mé-cra, mais rien qu'on réfléchis
Ils tournent tous autour de ma bite, comme si il chercher du plaisir
Un poto qui sort du hebs, sa queue est direct dans une chatte
Celui qui s'acharne a brisé mes principes, cherche à détruire le patrimoine
Une beurette, deux chichas, je l'encule elle est son michtonage
La rage comme si j'n'avais rien, je fais gaffe au prochain virage

Je m'accroche à la vie, mais l'espace vital est violent, violent
Ça bombarde et ça tire, pourquoi le monde est si violent, violent
L'espace vital est violent, violent, violent
L'espace vital est violent, violent, violent
Le rap game c'est violent, violent, violent
Pour moi la vie c'est violent, violent, violent

Villa vue sur mers, une tonne de shit avec
Tu parle espagnol, là-bas, tu a fait trois pige de hebs
Tu sort, puis tu retourne au quartier
Tout le monde est content, mais t'a changé, t'a le visage marqué
Maintenant tu sais qui est qui, t'a su te connaitre toi-même
La mal chance est le mectoub couche ensemble dans une chambre d'hôtel
Adultère ou marié, la relation est tragique
Je sais plus si c'est mieux de mourir, ou de continuer à vivre
Truc de ouf ce que je viens de dire, mais c'est la vie qui veut ça
Ce que j'ai sur le cœur, il y a que ceux qui traîne avec moi qu'ils savent
Pour me détendre, j'achète des pe-sa, même ça je le fais plus
2014 j'ai perdu le (?), je vais te là mettre dans le cul
Ne me parle plus, sauf s'il s'agit d'oseille
Comme le métro, ma carrière à traverser le tunnel
Mêle toi de ce qui te regarde, bientôt je sors mon album
J'irais faire le tour de la France sans le maillot jaune

Derrière une grosse marge y'a une grosse peine

Et que j'me crois aux States

J'ai les pieds sur Terre mais le géant a la tête dans les nuages
C'est pour ça qu'j'ai personne dans mon sillage
Quand j'valide une prod' j'rentre pas en cabine d'essayage
J'ai volé l'armure de Pégase à Seiya
J'entends le bruit du GP volé dès l'sbah
Les cris d'une mère affolée quand les keufs débarquent
Du chahut dans l'immeuble, la famille recouverte de honte
Menotté au milieu de la cité, tout l'monde te regarde mal dans l'fond
Mais c'est ça la vie, c'est ça le drame
On marche pas sur les charbons ardents sans avoir le pied qui crame
Moi j'ai la tête crâmée, mon casier loin d'être vierge
Armé de savoir, soif de vengeance
Comme Monte-Cristo, rien n'arrive par hasard
Moment d'réflexion, je repense à nos morts
La vie serait pareille s'ils n'étaient pas morts?
Faut pas s'poser ce genre de questions
Faut jamais douter d'Dieu pour pas s'faire sauter le caisson

Jusqu'à ce que je te croise en boîte, j'ai des grosses biatchs à ma table
J'ai trop la haine, perdue d'vue, morte comme dans Love Cimetière
J'ai appris que t'allais te fiancer, ça m'a laissé un goût amer
Je t'ai cherché, je t'ai trouvé, je voulais pas que tu te maries
Laisse tomber, tu te cherches encore c'est ce que tu m'as dis
Je n'étais pas prêt, est-ce un amour impossible?
Écorché vif, c'est l'histoire de ma vie, qui m'empêche de vivre
Bref, on a donc chacun fait nos vies
Dans les bras d'un autre, je me demande, est-ce que tu m'oublies?

Les années sont passées, un jour on se revoit
Le hasard fait bien les choses, car on est surpris de le voir
J'ai toujours de l'amour pour toi
J'ai toujours de l'amour pour toi

On s'aimait, on s'est déchiré, on s'est séparés plusieurs fois
Là c'est fini pour de vrai, bébé pas comme la dernière fois
Mais le cœur ne choisit pas, je kiffe trop sa peau douce
Perdu face au mystère de l'amour (un jour peut-être)
Perdu face au mystère de l'amour (un jour peut-être)
Perdu face au mystère de l'amour, c'est comme ça mon bébé
On s'aimait, on s'est déchiré, on s'est séparés plusieurs fois
Là c'est fini pour de vrai, bébé

Un jour peut-être, un jour peut-être
Là c'est fini pour de vrai bébé

Mac Tyer,"Ma grande fille qui part en vrille
Mon adolescence fut chaotique
On a toujours été hors-système
On vend la drogue, on fait la zik’
Y’a que ça qui puisse me ronger
Comme les regrets d’un octogénaire
Si j’trouve pas chaussure à mon pied
Je cours pieds nus sur la pierre
Et nique sa mère les raclis
Oseille, oseille tu peux m’aller
Le vice s'arrête quand ton courage
J'ui visse sa tête pas l'temps d'hurler
Plongé dans la tristesse
Tu n'entends que ma colère
Sur cette Terre
Inaya sera mon seul rayon de soleil
La nuit j'aperçois quelque chose
Grâce à la Lune, fils de pute
J'serai une légende pour de vrai si tu m'allumes
Le légiste y verra des signes de lutte
Au bord du précipice, je récidive
La vie c'est pas MTV
Je m'en bats les couilles de tout
Comme ce petit négro d'MTP
Auber' c'est criminel
Pire que la ville à Chief Keef
J'peux pas oublier d'où j'viens
Quand je regarde mes cicatrices

La planète est sous tensions
C'est la guerre un peu partout
J'ai la peine d’un Gazaoui
Que je partage sur mon Facebook

Tout ce que je touche je le détruis comme l'amour de mon ex-femme
J'ai décidé de vendre du textile, pour rester intouchable
Je ne vois pas mon avenir parce que je marche dans les ténèbres
J'rappe pour oublier mon mal-être

Parce que je suis malheureux
Malheureux, je suis malheureux, malheureux
Cherche pas à comprendre je suis malheureux

Quand j'me lève j'ai personne près de moi
Elle m'a dit ""je t'aime""
Normal, j'l'ai trop baisée hier soir
Que du sexe y'a rien d'autre
Vieille pute j'ai mes objectifs
Tu m'coûtes trop cher et t'es perdue
C'est du chantage affectif
Quand tu m'suces
J'entends le bruit de tes boucles d'oreilles
Maman m'a dit ""fiston, va jusqu'au bout de ton rêve""
Bats la race de c'que vous dîtes sur moi
Y'a personne qui m'fait manger
Qui aurait fait une carrière si longue que la mienne
Sans avoir de trophée?
Moi j'ai tout vendu dans ma vie sauf l'héroïne
Y'a rien d'héroïque
Mon plaisir est dans le biff qui rentre
Je trouve ça érotique
Ça t'fait marrer hein?
Mais la misère est un ras-de-marée
Qui expliquera cette rafale le jour de ton mariage
Caché derrière tes gosses pour pas t'faire fumer
Jamais au calme, toujours pressé
J'cherche une presse pour la CC
Les portes de l'avenir sont ouvertes à ceux qui peuvent la pousser

Je ne lâche rien comme Kickos

On dirait le cachot des Enfers
Cet endroit où les frères s'entretuent
La neutralité absolue des fils de lâche
Me donne envie de faire du sale encore plus

Soldat du bitume, au placard, sur le terter
De nos jours faut marcher droit
Ou t’en prends deux dans les vertèbres
Gardien en deuil, personne ne sèche les larmes de ta mère
T’as voulu mourir pour le tieks
Ou juste pour l'argent d’la cess’
Tous voisins de palier, chez soi chacun sa misère
Petit frère j'peux pas t'inderdire de vi-ser
Chaque famille a ses secrets
À chacun ses blessures, trouve ta manière de guérir
Pour réussir en France j'ai décidé de n'plus vivre
Est-ce de la pure folie? Nan, c'est mûrement réfléchi
Dans cette vie, nous sommes que fléchettes
Parc'que l'argent c'est le mile
La vie est trop courte
Pour la gâcher en s'engueulant avec ses amis
J'entends trompettes et roulements de tambours
Parce que le roi arrive
Trop d'placard, trop d'placard
Tu sais même plus où est ta place dehors
Tu cherches à tout remettre à sa place, à sa place
Tu crois que c'est le désordre
C'est juste les temps qu'ont changé

Le cœur en peine le général ne perd pas ses galons
Mon ambition n'a pas touché le plafond
J'veux du pouvoir et palper les millions
J'ai la haine plus que la veille
Prend ce que Dieu me donne hamdulilah, feu sur toi
T'as voulu la mettre à l'envers en voulant mal parler sur moi
Mais j'ai pris sur moi, je fais, tu me regardes faire
Ce monde n'a plus pitié pour personne mon frère
Tu pars en vacances et t'exploses en plein air
Paix aux âmes parties pour rien comme Driver
Beaucoup ont regretté leurs actes quand ils ont entendu le Fazer
Épuisés, les policiers sont les chasseurs
Chez nous les Blancs du quartier sont les passeurs

On the trail of the old lonesome pine 
Thinking of you, feeling so blue 
Wondering why you left me behind

Our hearts were gay and happy then

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

Mac Wiseman,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

To watch the scene below
The creek and the rusty old mill, Maggie
Where we sat in the long, long ago.
The green grove is gone from the hill, Maggie
Where first the daisies sprung
The old rusty mill is still, Maggie
Since you and I were young.

A city so silent and lone, Maggie
Where the young and the gay and the best
In polished white mansion of stone, Maggie
Have each found a place of rest
Is built where the birds used to play, Maggie
And join in the songs that were sung
For we sang just as gay as they, Maggie
When you and I were young.

They say I am feeble with age, Maggie
My steps are less sprightly than then
My face is a well written page, Maggie
But time alone was the pen.
They say we are aged and grey, Maggie
As spray by the white breakers flung
But to me you're as fair as you were, Maggie
When you and I were young.

Let us sing of the days that are gone, Maggie

As a dedicated family man and cold blooded hitman

Wasn't a very nice man

And struck like lightning

Hang down your head and cry (ay-ay),

There I took her life.

I stabbed her with my knife.

Per una lucciola c'è chi riduce la velocità chissà
Che escogita mha! C'è chi vomita l'anima in un bar
Che si illumina come un coshar

Che ha trovato una cicca di Pall Mall
E se l'accende davanti ad una banca
Fari di una macchina che sosta in fondo
Quanto costa un condom?

Quanto costa il mondo
Sotto gli spot puntati sui viaggi in Congo?
Quanto costa un sogno?
Nulla sulla panchina che mi culla come nel vientre
Di una bolla che valla mentre vado su!

Que esta noche chico no hay excusa
De roncones saldrán ritmos que fusionan
Mentalidades in a one connection

Vayan donde vayan
Vengan de donde vengan
Lo que nos unió no nos lo quitarán

Then one day the rose was kissed by the dew
A new love was born and the violet turned blue

Roses are red violets are blue
I'm sending red red roses to you
If you care to send some flowers to me
Then send me some violets I'm blue as can be

I wanted my love to bouquet with you
Just like the rose you've proven untrue
A flower that's wild they say has no home
And just like the violet I'm left all alone

Roses are red violets are blue...
Send me some violets I'm blue as can be

I need to find, find someone to call mine,
But mama said you can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
You can't hurry love,
No, you just have to wait,
You gotta trust, give it time,
No matter how long it takes;
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again.

When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone,
I remember mama said,

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,

How long must I wait how much more can I take,
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone.
I grow impatient for a love to call my own,
But when I feel that I, I can't go on,
These precious words keeps me hanging on,

Soft voice to talk to me at night,
For some tender arms to hold me tight.

You can't hurry love no,

La chica que quería para mí
Es traicionera y me quemaba hasta morir

Hay algo que quiero decir
Esto no me puede estar pasando a mí
La chica que quería para mí
Es traicionera, es traicionera, y

Pásame la botella
Voy a beber en nombre de ella
Pásame la botella
Voy a beber en nombre de ella, ja

Todo lo que le brindé
Le di mi amor y mi cariño también
Lo que ella me pedía se lo daba también
Un carro, una casa, y me pregunto por qué, por qué

Ella se fue con otro hombre
Ahora de la barra solito me quedé
Borracho, tirado con ganas de beber
Y le dije al cantinero otra vez

Pásame la botella
Voy a beber en nombre de ella
Pásame la botella
Voy a beber en nombre de ella

Todos los que han sido traicionados
Y con la botella se han desahogados
A la cuenta de tres
Quiero ver a todo el mundo con el coro
One, two, ja

Pásame la botella
Voy a beber en nombre de ella
Pásame la botella
Voy a beber en nombre de ella

Hay algo que quiero decir
Esto no me puede estar pasando a mí
La chica que quería para mí
Es traicionera, es traicionera, y

Pásame la botella
Voy a beber en nombre de ella
Pásame la botella
Voy a beber en nombre de ella

Pásame, pásame, pásame, pásame la botella
Quiero brindar por ella
Pásame, pásame, pásame, pásame la botella

Tú lo tienes que olvidar y te lo tienes que sacar
Igual no te sientas mal
Lo tienes que sanar

Machan,"Yesterday a sad goodbye
I told you that it wouldn't be for long
But it seems like a thousand years since I've been gone
Oh, what I'd give to hold you in my arms
Can't you see how much I need you tonight
I'm going crazy girl, can't get you off of my mind
Everyday that I live without you
I just can't help but dream about you
Everywhere I go
And after all the love that I've left behind me
You're the one I keep inside me
Everywhere I go... I get that feeling
It's hard to be so far apart
When thoughts of you keep coming on so strong
I picture you in every face I see
Now I know I left a part of me back home with you
There's nothing like falling for the very first time
I won't forget you girl, for the rest of my life
Everyday that I live without you
I just can't help but dream about you
Everywhere I go
And after all the love that I've left behind me
You're the one I keep inside me
Everywhere I go
I get that feeling
Everywhere I go
I get that feeling
You're with me 
Everywhere I go
Everyday that I live without you
I just can't help but dream about you
Everywhere I go
And after all the love
That I've left behind me
You're the one I keep inside me

You'll always be here right beside me

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low

You're proud of the guns you hold

Yo, I had a dream that the world changed
And for a minute there was no pain
Instead of presidents and old sayings
I heard lyrics from Kurt Cobain
Then I wake up to see the world's ill
Ocean's tainted from the oil spills
How many kids have these wars killed?
How many families can't afford bills?
I wish I could let the world know
That it's okay to let the pain show
And even though times seem bad
It always rains before the rainbow

And in the world money controls everything we believe in

They told me fight night I'm supposed to lose
Just 'cause in hindsight, they don't like my type
White boy with some rhythm and blues

I scream at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now, where can we go?

(I think we all) We all need a little more love
(I think we all) We all need a little more love
(We just need) Ooh a little more love
(The world needs) Ooh little more love

You can give up like they tell you
Stop like they tell you
Be scared to dream for the top like they tell you
But I'm tryna tell you, fuck what they tell you

(I think we, uh) And in these dark times
As a part of a generation they claim can't be saved
It’s important to know we’re not blind
We see the truth through blue and dark eyes
I would rather die on my feet than live my knees
If I can't live free right now in the world we just need (A little more love)

A little more love

And what if I never left out of Denver that winter for new beginnings

Bright lights and packed concerts
And right next to the gun that's on my dresser

Me and my entourage no Jeremy Piven, listen
It's better to burn out then fade away is what Kurt said

Machine Gun Kelly,"And that was a dark depressing time for him, you know
He did had one visit with his mother I think
During the time that he lived with me and she brought
Him a huge box filled with gifts you know clothes and all
Kinds of little goodies and stuff and it sat in the corner
Untouched, literally for months he'd never opened anything just
Left the box there

What's going on in your mind when someone
You haven't seen since you were nine is out at your door step right now?
Rewind, remember that one time when Marco showed up at the front door
And we found out he escaped from a psych ward
And stole grandma's car?
Ah, rest her soul
I know that's off topic, but I miss her soul
So ironic that she was blind but told me how handsome I was
Every time that I walked in the door
Can't lie and say it was easy being 14 on February 14th
Watching a body die in my arms
Then have to go to a school that I hated
When my grade indicate that I don't give a fuck what's going on
A couple hours later on
And not to mention that one bitch that I loved
By the way I call her ""bitch"" because she was
Wanted me to catch another man fucking her
Invited me over, told me to come into the front
Come upstairs and say what's up
And there she was
Little slut
I was broken hearted, should've broke that bitch's jaw
Just for playin' me like a chump
But instead went to the garage, grabbed one
Of her brother's rifles, went outside, and shot that other
Mothafucka's truck up
I guess that's what lead me to cuffs
Becomin' common in my life like funerals was
Daddy's less common now, he gave up
After he heard the judge pin a fucking felony on his son
Funny enough
Me and Aunt Barbara even closer
Start to feel some weight lift off her shoulder
Till it piled back on when a radiologist told her
That she had breast cancer and might not live much longer
Fast forward
The woman that I call my ""mother"" isn't my mother
Or even blood but that's how much I love her
And I'm feeling awkward 'cause the doorbell's from the person that I call her
Maybe I ain't ready for it
Shit, what should I wear?
Fuck that, I ain't going down there
I waited over a decade for closure
Why should I receive it if it might not be something I want to hear
In the mirror is a empty reflection
And in my head are questions I want to ask like, ""Where the fuck did you go?""
Why did you turn my birthdays to the worst days every year that you didn't show?
And if you must know, I didn't turn out to be much else
Than a drunk who fell face first to a pile of hell
Took four snuffs of the devil's dust
Ended up with my manager helping me 'cause I couldn't take a piss by myself
But I did get a record deal
And all my records got that making of a legend feel
And I did have a daughter who I promised that the way you made me felt
Is a way she will never, feel
Slip a Benadryl in my cup
Ech, fuck it I'm sickening up
Pit of my stomach clenching, all my muscles stiffening up
I ain't been this nervous since I got jumped
Flick the tip of my J over a surface cover with ashes and junk
Took a pull and set it down
Put on both of my Chucks
Reach for the door but my hand's sweaty, I'm anxious as fuck
Couldn't even hit the stairs without
Remembering how many years I was there waiting to see your car pull up
Now you saying she's right there?
Man you saying she's right there?
You telling me if I open up this door right here
That she'll been standing right there?
And after all these years am I wrong for having this fear
Of meeting the reflection that was missing in the mirror
Open up the door and then I see her",Story of the Stairs

This shit right here, man, this shit feels right!
Aye Doug, aye Dray, aye Earl, you know it’s all year right? Hah!
I'm sitting here in the middle of New York City,
The night before I gotta turn my second album in, higher than a motherfucka, drunker than a motherfucka,
With my boys, and I’m thinking, damn, man 5 years ago, we were dead broke chilling in Cleveland everyday,
And the next thing you know, people are calling us about record deals.
And you know, the crazy part is,
Ashleigh rented this white Nissan Altima for me and Slim so we could drive out to New York.
I think she had to some work some shit or something like that so she couldn’t go
So we were gonna go out there and see what these labels were talking about.
And I’m driving us there, but my license’s suspended
So I tell Slim, I'm like “Yo, I gotta pull up before we get to New York and switch,
So you can drive in case we get pulled over""
'Cause we got pulled over the last time we went there.
But you know, he had a license so it made sense for him to drive
So cut to like 7 and a half hours later,
I pull over in this emergency lane and right as I’m opening the door to switch with Slim, boom!
This fucking car going full speed on the highway swerves off the road and smashed into us.
Yo, I swear to God I woke up half my body’s laying outside the car in a ditch,
Like 15-20 feet away from where we just were.
The car was totaled, the windows were smashed, it was cold as fuck, it was raining outside,
But we were, we were actually okay.
I mean, my boy had to go the hospital you know the ambulance came and shit, he ended up being alright,
But our meeting’s with the record label started at 2 and we didn’t have no car,
And now we were stuck in a fucking hospital in New Jersey.
So this dude that, I ended up partnering with later on, his name’s James McMillan,
He comes and gets us to these meetings and shit, somehow, someway.
I don’t know if it was just because we just got into a crazy car crash and could’ve died a couple of hours ago
But I'm in there and like you know I’m not feeling this shit man I’m not feeling this record label shit
And a, we drove back to Cleveland.
Now I'm back in Ashleigh's mom's basement, I'm thinking about life, you know,
I'm on a shit ton of vicodin 'cause the doctors at the hospital
You know gave us something 'cause we got into that car accident and Ashleigh runs downstairs and she’s like
“Yo, yo, Kells, Kells, you're not gonna believe who wants to talk to you right now.
""I’m like, ""who?” She’s like “He’s gonna call you in 30 seconds.""
Now I guess, when I was in New York, I had made some kinda noise 'cause this dude named Byron
Who ended up becoming my manager later on, took this video I had called “Chip off the Block”
Over to Bad Boy and showed Harve Pierre and Harve Pierre went and showed that vid to a guy named Puff,
So I answer my phone, depressed, down, fucked up on vicodin and I hear,
“Please hold, I have Mister Sean Combs for you.""
I said, god damn, life’s about to change, man, I felt it.
And sometimes that's all it takes, it’s just that feeling you know what I mean.
I knew I was gonna be here, and now I’m here

Okay I'm reaching in my pocket
Got a condom and a hundred dollar bill
I can snort a rock or I can spend it on a pill
I be with some models that just flew in from Brazil
And they give me pussy 365 days a year bitch
I'm the type to never go to sleep
I'm the type to break a couple motherfucker's teeth
I'm the type to drop a hit of acid on the beach
And fly to Baltimore and scream, ""Fuck the police!""
Do not get it twisted, this is not an image
There are legends told about the nights I'm in the buildings
It is not a question whether or not I'm the trillest
Every bitch is pressing me to get some cum on their acrylics
One point five million for my record deal and now I got the feeling
I could finally give a fuck about my parents' marriage healing (fuck 'em)
I'ma buy some mirrors just to put them on the ceiling
So when I wake up I see the realest motherfucker breathing

I know you've been gone, gone, gone
I know you've been gone, gone, gone
But are you missing me?
I know you're missing me

Looking down on my phone, see another missed call
I'm pissed off, I never had these problems back when I was piss poor
Scared to see my daughter now because I'm lost in the life
In the bathroom getting high when she called twice
Sorry, but I'm scared at looking at something so precious when I'm a mess
And her mother knows it
I wonder if she ever regrets
Trying to convince my family that I'm only gone for these checks
When really I'm obsessed with getting my revenge through success
'Cause people hated on me, how can I not show 'em?
Fans waited on me, damn, how do I not owe 'em?
Imagine having to make that decision
While baby girl's in the kitchen, tears dripping, wondering where her pop's going
But I never meant to make you unhappy, can I see that smile?
Phone's ringing, ""Ey, yo, I'm with my child""
Anyways, I wanna write you a symphony
But instead she said all I ever wanted is you to stay a while, damn

I know you've been gone, gone, gone
I know you've been gone, gone, gone
I know you've been gone, gone, gone
But are you missing me?
I know you're missing me

And hey, hey, hey
It's been so long so you've gone away

Five years to be more specific
I was out here trying to sign to Atlantic
You crossed the Pacific
Now is it a coincidence that my first instrument was a violin
That my father wanted for me, so we ended up buyin'
And now the instrumental that we're vibing to got one high end
And while I'm writing my first verse he called me up crying?
That shit is crazy, half a decade with no explanation
Now you're asking if it's too late to save us
Man, I don't know so I hang up but I'm saying nothing, just click end
Wasn't man enough to say it so I wrote with a pen
I just wanted to make you happy, but you never smile
I just wanted that phone call that said your daddy's proud
Anyways, maybe eventually we'll relive memories and you'll be next to me and both of us can stay a while, yeah

I know you've been gone, gone, gone
I know you've been gone, gone, gone

Machine Gun Kelly,"Okay, I got a question
Am I loud out there?
I mean, do you really hear me? Huh?

The definition of greatness
Is in the making you're witnessing the amazing
Blame me if you awaken you've been sleeping too long
On the one who was chosen motherfucker
You're probably unaware
But I'm here to let you know it, take a listen
Shut the fuck up for once and just enjoy it, real Music
Bullshit on the daily? Try to avoid it
Your life's ass, similar to a toilet huh?
You see me living chasing everything I wanted, huh?
Forever blunted, ready for whatever coming, huh?
The mailman keep the check coming
The cash in keep the 'vette running
Stop sign? Bitch I run that
Look at where I hung at,
Bunch of Eastside boys on the field, punt that, Ball 4 life!
Give me some shrooms for the serotonin
Me and the crew living for the moment
Everything we wanted is ours

Put me in a fast car
Big house with a beach for a backyard
Stress free 'cause I ain't trying to live with it
The state of mind that I'm in got me thinking different
I used to dream until I
Realized it wasn't shit in reality
'Cause you can make it happen and I'ma make it happen
You gon' watch me make it happen, bet you gon' remember me

You gon' watch me make it happen, bet they gon' remember me

Bet they gon' remember me

Damn, so many people got them hating faces
Like why you mad at me? I’m just out here getting faces
Irritated with these bitches and their crazy ways, when
All I wanted was some head on a lazy day, damn
(Where you been?) On the other side of the map
Taking naps in first class getting paid to rap paid off
Having jobs since the seventh grade
Got laid off ever since I've been self made
See my homie wanna see me win
Fronted me some bands told me ""Youngin go and get it in""
He believed in it more than I, So I gotta ride
Down to die for my dawgs, yep, EST 4 Life
Opportunity took advantage I gotta manage
Even when it's hard, hard times, yea, what would I be without it?
The struggle made me tougher, forcing me to hustle money in demand
Fuck fame ain't nothing but trouble dawg
I'm never perfect, I got flaws like a lot of ya'll
Who be criticizing on the low, hating on ya boy
Ya'll defensive maybe that's why I offend you
When I dribble through my legs in the mall when it's time to ball
Life on the edge, hope I never fall
Though you pray I do, what a shame
But I maintain shooting for the stars
Let it bang bitch I'm out of range
And just know I shoot back with my rap name

Put me in a fast car
Big house with a beach for a backyard
Stress free 'cause I ain't trying to live with it

Summer day
Bobby and his girl would wake up every summer day
This boy and girl had nothing, they were runaways
So in love that now all they wanted was pain and so it came
Never had a silver spoon present in the past
Now at last, the spoon is present and so the boy wet it
Told her bring him a slab, a cotton swab, and a match
And told her one day they’ll fly across the world and have a wedding
Like “baby I have a plan, come with me to this place
Baby give me your hand, now flip it give me a vein
Baby take off your belt, we’ll use it as a restraint”
She sees that it starts to melt, he reaches inside a case
Fills the needle with food, flicks the needle with haste
Brings the needle to her, she isn’t right in the face
The boy can tell that she’s scared, he says “I love you, okay?”
Then shoves it into her arm and says “how the fuck does that taste baby?!”

Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down

Her dress drops, her head drops
Swiggin’ out of a whiskey bottle, he just watch
But he was not Bobby, see Bobby had joined the army
Been gone for a couple months now she’s messin with everybody
Everyone of the dealers, everyone hears her squealing
Trading pussy for product, she did anything for that feeling
But then she started that feeling, early morning she’s kneelin’
In front of the toilet look at her belly there’s no concealing
That she’s expecting a child
This woman is living foul
She’s only 20 years old
And hardly can even smile
Ultrasound shows a baby that’s barely over a pound
Sold everything in her house just trying to score an ounce
News of her baby’s father was that he died in the war
Now that syringe is all that keeps her alive anymore
No mattress, so her and her child dyin’ on the floor
As a letter’s at the door reading
“I’ll be home tomorrow. Love, Bobby”

Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry, merry, merry go round

Knockin’ at the door but doesn’t get an answer
Bobby’s nervous, his heart starts to beat faster
He hasn’t talked to his girl in so long
She sold his phone for a hit
Damn how he wish that he could hear her laughter
But his drug hit her like a cancer
And he forgot ‘cause he had left and cleaned his act up
Passenger seat in his Acura got a picture of ‘em kissing
Under the words ""happily ever after”
He walks into the house, it’s a fuckin’ disaster
Every step he takes his shoe crushes a capsule
Holds his breath, he knows what he smells isn’t natural
Looks down, it’s the body of the queen of his castle
“Baby please, baby please!""
""Wake up!”
He screams on his knees and he sees her hands around her stomach
Inside was a child
And realizes it was his
Summer day,
An entire family died on that summer day
‘Cause a facade made a girl give her love away
But those were Bobby’s consequences that he had to pay
Love is pain

Couple grams of Aunt Jemima
In my hand like candid camera

Pulling up to Grandma's, I smell bacon, eggs are scrambled
Hoppin' out then ol' boy ran up my dog grabbed the MC Hammer
Blammer blammer make him dance

Used to ride RTA a dollar fifty every meter, food
Wasn’t guaranteed I stole my meals out of Arabica, speakers
Blasting my own shit, bow tie on the jet on my grown shit
Court side at the game with the owner
And sell the same arena out when I’m homesick
God damn I'm a fool

Couple hundred bitches in the pool

Please God don't let them take none of the paint from me
And since you need a filler for the dead space
Sorry I had to get my head straight
One of the homies back home caught a fed case
And how I'm suppose to feel
When I'm in Hollywood trynna get a couple mil
And I just got a call that my dawg got killed
And maybe it wouldn't have happened if I wouldn't have been out here but
And still even back when dub had a job cuttin' steel
Even back when we was on the block up the hill
Up a hundred thirty first there was blood gettin' spilled
I ain't re-invent the wheel motherfucker
This is how it is where I live motherfucker

Just in case they run up in the crib motherfucker's got kids motherfucker ay

Taking out my vengeance

Question during sex if ...
Is this how it fucking feels
Or am I faking it ?

The winds of change, our bloodbath

Gnash down our teeth in hate and sing
Sing revolution's song
When they say die
Die for America

Power and prejudice
Actions they use to pit against
Terror, insurgency
Words used to scare conformity

It's propaganda, it's their hypocrisy
Free to choose our own slavery
All suffer humanity, fuck


Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight

So fight for all that you love
(Fight, fight, fight, fight)
Scream, choking with foot open throat
(Fight, fight, fight, fight)

Blind star spangled eyes
(Fight, fight, fight, fight)
Death, no more the truth you will hide, no more
(Fight, fight)

So how do they sleep?
While our mothers weep
They're selling our souls
(They're selling our souls)
And our blood for oil

Our generation can be the fucking one
That overcomes the greed of corrupt nations
Have no shame
You're not alone in thinking, this is fucking insane

Rise up and take your stand
You curl the fingers of your hand

I don't know what to do
'Cause I don't have the answers
With every ounce of strength
I'll vow to fight the cancer

Didn't say I want to lead
I just might let you down
Didn't say believe in me
Just hold this common ground

I'm just as lost as you
And probably more confused
So fucking far from perfect
My mind wrecked from abuse

There's something fucking wrong
When war takes sons and daughters
Our lambs misled to slaughter

Awake from the slumber and define this time

Cast off the shackles of the past
Live in the moment nothing ever lasts

Held fist at skies,

Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Remain to love until they droop and die

De esas que cuando se agitan sudan chanel number three
Que sueñan casarse con un doctor
Pues el puede mantenerlas mejor
No le hablan a nadie si no es su igual
A menos que sea un fulano de tal
Son lindas delgadas de buen vestir
De mirada esquiva y falso reir

El era un muchacho plstico de esos que veo por ahi
Con la peinilla en la mano y cara de yo no fui
De los que por tema en conversacion
Discuten que marca de carro es mejor
De los que prefieren el no comer
Por las apariencias que hay que tener
Pa andar elegantes y asi poder una chica plastica recoger

Que fallo

Era una pareja plastica de esas que veo por ahi
El pensando sol en dinero
Ella en la boda en paris
Aparentando lo que no son
Viviendo en un mundo de pura ilusion
Diciendo a su hijo de cinco años
No juegues con niños de color extraño
Ahogados en deudas para mantener
Su estatus social en boda o hotel

Que fallo

Era una ciudad de plastico de esas que no quiero ver
De edificios cancerosos y un corazon de oro ver
Donde en ves de un sol amanece un dolar
Donde nadie rie donde nadie llora
Con gente de rostros de polister
Que escuchan sin oir y miran sin ver
Gente que vendio por comodidad
Su razon de ser y su libertad

Recuerda se ven las caras
Pero nunca el corazón
No te dejes confundir
Busca el fondo y su razón
Recuerda se ven las caras
Y jamas el corazón
Recuerda se ven las caras
Y jamas el corazón

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vay, pero nunca el corazón

Del plovo venimos todos y ahi regresaremos como dice la canción

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vay, pero nunca el corazón

Recuerda que el plastico se derrite, si la de de lleno el sol

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vay, pero nunca el corazón

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vay, pero nunca el corazón

Estudia, trabaja y se gente primero alli está la salvación

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vay, pero nunca el corazón

Pero que mira mira no te dejes confundir, busca el fondo y su razón

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vay, pero nunca el corazón

Pa' lante, pa' lante, pa' lante, pa' lante, pa' lante
Y asi seguiremos unidos y al final venceremos

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vay, pero nunca el corazón

Pero señoras y señores, en medio del plastico 
También se ven las caras de esperanza
Se ven las caras que trabajan por una

Straight out to get paid, stack the loot that I made
Been slangin' dope out my mamas' house since the 10th grade

Never tried it can't deny it in the tiots was a looter
Used to hang with drive by shooters, stick 'em up for Honda scooters
Never was a scholar, make you throw yo hands and holla
Wolla went to Jr. high slangin' joints for a dollar

Finger waves was the new fad, so they spotted a due rags
Niggas got dumped on for the red or blue rags
Down with the G's so them niggas never serve me
Bellin' through the hood in my honeycomb Jersey

Painter pants cuffed so I fix it on my biscuits
Til' my hair get long enough to braid, my bitch I'll keep it twisted
It's that nigga runnin' wild punch the pedal to the meadow
And everywhere I go it's a must, I keep it ghetto

Can't hack this monkey on my back
So I shot it, now you plot it, I got it
Exotic to erotic money hoes to narcotics

No preachin' knowledge of self or religion
I'm too busy raisin' pitbulls and pigeons
Put the hustle down steady for the summer
I'm ready way tighter, got two birds and a rider

But I'm out for mo nigga can't get enough doe
Place my hands on the 4-4
Arm robbery is my hobby
So I gotta sick 'em then lick 'em
Now who's my next victim

Choose one, choose one
1 2 3 4 hit it! [Repeat: x 2]

Got the plaque in the back, straight rag top
Peepin' the scene with the gangsta lean
Super clean in and out, make you weak at the knees
I watch for the thieves, on my hunt spoke D's

Stereo type for life from the streets where the palms trees sway
And the money parlay
For block niggas got the hoes like sewed up
Bitches on my nuts every since I first showed up

BG nigga with my though skins hangin'
Tryin' to look like my big homies that was bangin'
Slangin' like 90, goin' north with the cavey
Twistin' through the hood in a 83 caddy

Coupe Deville I packs my big still
Cause it's sittin' on white ones with the two way tight ones
And as I floss I keeps my nina Ross
Cocked with the clippin' to catch a nigga slippin'

[Chorus]
Ice Cube: Cause if you fuck with us we leave scars

Mack 10,"Quietly I stalk niggas call me the Chicken Hawk
Approach with my gun in a 2-1-1 
As I sick'em lay my victim may I lick'em 
All action stop nobody move no pop 
As I wreck shop red alert make yo blood squirt 
When I work in the brownies and the high top chucks to do dirt 

Keep it sound put it down my way 
Protected by an A.K. as I search for my pray 
Through the ghetto hit the peddle every corner I'm turning 
Look for the money the kilos and the gallons of shermin nigga 
Till we meet I stash my heat 
Neat in my baggage do damage nasty as a savage 
Looking for the cabbage 

It's on 20 grand I spot a bird in hand 
As I spread my wing span I swoop ready to land 
Got to get him, hit the spot grab the sack 
And I shake it blessed with the game 
To make it bus its easier to take it, nigga 

[Chorus]
I'm a chicken hawk hunting for a chicken 
Sticking, my hit to ya brain with the cane, nigga 
I'm a chicken hawk hunting for a chicken 
Sticking, my hit to ya brain with the cane, nigga 

""Don't make me kill everybody on this motherfucker"" 

On a late night creep the hawk sours on a mission 
Mashing through the hood heard this nigga had the chickens 
36 zones in each sack to be exact 
Got 50 G's or more in street value worth of crack 

As he put it down out of control with the cavey 
Got Benzos on the grass twisting front and back Cadi's 
Cappuccino instead of coffee moet 
No more rossie, rolex diamonds all glossy 
Glossy, Mr. Flossy 

Sewed up the block keys to double up rock 
I gotta lick him, nigga won't know what hit him when I get him 
Shoot straight never hesitate fools cooperate 
Or I drag, tag them body bag'em with my magnum 

Heat in yo chest how we do it in the west 
I gaffle up yo dope and fly back to my nest 
I stalk hit up in chalk all over the sidewalk 
Its Mack 10 fo' life better know as the chicken hawk 



Interlude: 

Man: Allo 

Mack 10: Yeah nigga, I got yo bitch, so take all the ??? you got and put on ??? behind the ??? or I kill this motherfucker 

Girl: Fuck this nigga don't give any shit 

Mack 10: Bitch shut the fuck up right now 


On a midnight flight the hawk glides through the breeze 
Pull my wings at ease as I lands in the palm trees 
Overlook my lick set my scope like a sniper 
Hawk the bitch piper be alarmed for the type a fool 

That I hoot ride when he do ride 
I came ruff out the box Inglewood school of hard knots, nigga 
A gaffle dick is all I ever gave a hoe 
Where peneltons not a cape so I can't save a hoe 

Mack 10 just stepped off the planet of the apes 
Foe the money and dope I never rapes I duck tapes 
Bitches I mack'em down flag'em down they pull over 
Feel lucky as a four leaf clover in a Range Rover 

They never know its the hawk his self 
My eyes redder than red with St. Ides on my breath 
I draw down all this licking got me nervous so I'm twitching
Bitch two to the dome or take me to yo nigga chickens

Mack 10 nutty as they come 
leave 'em face down

It's a Sunday a gun day
rollin' down a one way
in my 'lac front and back
over train tracks
On yak and herb nigga swerve

banked my Danas on the curb
In the gutta lane
I'm butta man
Foot to the flo'
what you want from the sto'
I'm broke as a muthafucka nigga buy my single
comin' from Ingle (Foe Life) is my jingle
Seen yo' bitch at the sto' coulda took her
but niggas start to handcuff they hoes like T.J. Hooker
Fool I'ma vet you can bet
that I can dance underwater and not get wet
It's the nappy headed nigga that can kill and rap
everybody run when I bust a cap
puttin' Inglewood up on the map
look at what I do when I pull my strap
Bust 2 rounds nigga about to clown
bitch hit the silent alarm it's goin' down

Khacki suit ski mask is my attire

Fool where ya keep the rims and tires
'fo yo' life expires I'm as nutty as Michael Myers
Didn't think about the Rottweiler

blood in the Impala
Sittin' in the County with a gold record
Ice Cube send me pictures of bitches naked
caught with a contraband in my hand
Mack 10 take the stand
your Honor I'ma changed man
so please let me go so I can flow
Got a show had to ask my P.O. can I go

and leave ya fuckin' dough

let the bullets hurl and feed my baby girl

There's gonna be a lot of cars with they lights on
and I'm at home sewing stripes on
Cause I'm the General and you's a stowaway

It's my Afrikan express I don't leave home without it
Summertime just ain't known for the weather
It's hot cause niggas bring out shit they put together

But on some shit you got to let 15-8's twist
Chevy trucks and 'em
El Caminos anybody want Danas i got them for eight ??????
All day long
Gold or all chrome it's on
You out to get 'em cause the tires come with 'em
but they ain't for busters only hogs roll D's
So keep yo' stocks on if you can't fade these
Thousand in my pocket, yayo I rock it
Keep my lond clean so the car hops can jock it hit the switch up and down
Make the bumper drag the ground on the 'Shaw
Every Sunday night just to clown on them thangs

Get the hammer
Be sure that yo strap ain't a jammer and as long
As ain't nuthin' wrong then beat I'm on
As I watch for the lick i got the switch to make me hit
Front back side to side and three wheel shit
Won't hesitate to let loose niggas broke the gang truce
But I still roll my deuce that hang like a noose
It don't stop for Mack, it's the same ol' same ol'
Danas gold as I lay low, twisting like a tornado 
in that surplus gear like the G of the year
Fuck the hour, it's all about the money and the power
Ain't about set trippin' no bloodin' no crippin'
Just dippin' hittin' switches knockin' hood rat bitches
As I'm rollin' out of control and smoking humps
Crank up the bumptie bumps 4 gates and square
Dumps so I bang it, make the 20's slide when I swang it
Lick it once lick it twice as nice 
when I hang it on them thangs  

D's I'm on 'em 
Killas they want 'em
On them thangs...

Old Chevy's to Cadillacs on twisters and Doves
Everybody got a plaque given pub to they car club
Mafia for life individuals and Damus Ride
Majestics and them niggas from the southside
New school to old school get they ride on
Bendin' corners caravaning like 50 strong
In a Rag Top that and a hard top this
Bustin ho's cause you can't miss if you let 'em twist
So get you a set of them what we call Dana's
And see for yo'self all the bitches they brang us 
cut the wheel right to left and make the ass end slide 
Now all the riders ride and skate from side to side

release of Westside Connection and Mack's new record, gangster rap
seems to be at an all time high.

Verse 1
Either the thrill of victory or the agony of defeat
you either got ends or struggle to make ends meet
You can either turn square or keep the mind of a rebel
some uppity livin' good some faced with death in the ghetto
I'm a product of the streets so I vow to never slip
so I trust no one and keep a P. Coltrane on my hip
I always paid attention while my O.G's was teachin'
Rule number one if it's on blast the first nigga reachin'
either death or the pen' shit I had to do better
It was a must I moved on and now I'm all about cheddar
a young entrepreneur I rather slang than bang
now girls be like you go Mack 10 baby do yo thang
So I continue to get down and I keep writin' rhymes
and I parlay every dollar to flip at least a hundred times
So keep your game tight and it's all fame and glory
and everything I recite's Based On A True Story

It was once said by a man who couldn't quit
Dopeman please can I have another hit
The Dopeman said cluck i don't give shit
If you girl kneel down, and suck my dick
Gave a nigga head, and homie tried to choke her
but he didn't care, cause she ain't nothing but a smoker
that's the way it go, that's the name of the game

Roll the six four with all gold Daytons
Live in Inglewood, California, CA.
This oozy up your ass if i don't get paid
Niggas beggin for credit, I'm knockin out teeth
Clockin much dollars on the first and fifteenth
Big wad a money, nothing less than a twenty
Yo you want to whole chicken, Mack 10 got plenty
To be a dopeman, boy you must qualify
don't get high off your own supply
From a Key to a G, Its all about money
Ten piece for a ten, base pipe come free

If you see somebody gettin money for crack

You need a nigga with money, so you get a Dopeman
Juice that fool for as much as you can
She like his car, and he get with her
Got a black eye, Cause the Dopeman hit her
Let that slide, and you pay it no mine
Find that he's slappin you all the time
But that's okay,  cause he's so rich
And you ain't nothing but the Dopeman's bitch
Do what he say, and you keep your mouth shut
Talkin' that drag might get ya fucked up
You sit and cry, If the Dopeman strike you
He don't give a fuck, he got two just like you
There's another girl in the Dopeman's life
Not quite a bitch, but far from a wife
She call a Strawberry, and everyone knows....
Strawberry, Strawberry is the neighborhood hoe
Do anything for a hit or two, give a bitch a rock
She fuck the whole damn crew
It might be your wife and it might make you sick
Come home and see her mouth on the Dopeman's dick
Strawberry, just look and you'll see her
But don't fuck around, she'll give you Ghonorea
If people out there, not hip to the fact
Strawberry is a girl, sellin pussy for crack

If you smoke caine, you a stupid motherfucker
Know around the hood as the schoolyard clucker
Doing that crack with all the money you got
On your hands and knees searchin for a piece of rock
Fienin for a hit, and you lookin for more
Done stole a Alpine out of Wavy six four
Smokin like a train, man I wouldn't want to be you
Done took from the homies, betta run, when i see you
Ballin everyday, doing more drug deals
Rollin' round town, on the twenty inch wheels
If people out there, not hip to the fact

Hey hey hey
What you got to say

Verse 1
Fast bitches fast cars money and fame
this rap shit is just like the '90's dope game
Before sold out shows rocked and hoes jocked
it was all about the 'hood and that Foe Hundred block
A few scraps as a puppy dog
you had to be down
to roam that infamous neighborhood
where niggas wore the crown
It was on every morning from Manchester to Century
BG's walkin' in packs to elementary
afterschool some had 'hood patrol
and watched deals on the corner
while others had skills and hittin' drills in Pop Warner
The unforgettable good old days how it used to be
'foe niggas made the transition from a jock to a G
now the streets is nice but the police is thick
'cause niggas sick and mo' murders
committed than a horror flick
but whatever happen rappin' or not
it's the same for me
it's still I.N.G. foe L.I.F.E.
so...

Ain't got nothing to lose, we got everything to lose

Threw his ass in, he feel the fin of the barracuda
I negotiate Mack is the shooter
You the nigga on the journey strapped to this gurney
We break breads with accountants and attorneys
Currency never worry me (never)
Who's got the balls to murder me
Degree higher than a 33
Tell em what you drank (Hennessy)
Never tell em what you thinking
Never tell em where the body stinking
Fuck Lincoln, fuck Jackson, banking Franklin what you thanking
Hope your man come with the ransom
Let me see you dance on, no longer handsome
If you don't drop off than walk off, watch him, watch him

[Chorus]

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Them west coast niggas is real set trippas
Will get you for them zippers, on a quest for them chippas
Sliding while we riding, not even hitting switches
Hanging at the high school getting at them young bitches
I got the dove sacks, homies love that (who got the bud)
Where the bud at, hollering at my big homeboy who fresh out
Hanging at my grand mama house, homie burnt out
What you gonna do when you get out of jail (speak on it)
I'm gonna have some fun
What do you consider fun a ounce and about five hun
So I put him on a move that I know about
Hooked him with a home girl from the South (good looking out)
Money made, plug a player in the game
Especially when he represent the same thing I claim
Damn they don't make niggas like they used to
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce deuce (that's real)
Cause everybody wanna be a star
In the city of dope, a.k.a. caviar

[Chorus]

[Mack 10]
What have we a house full of cavi (no stress)
Well known riders from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes licking up so hard we sticking up niggas
Tired of the bullshit so we clicken up
Nigga please we ain't tripping off C's and B's
It's the West side Connect with the DPG's
For the cheese we jab with the gift of the gab
Always capping, Mack, Cube and Snoop rapping
Now how did that happen it's all good (fool)
So peep game If you could
Snoop be from Long Beach and I be from Inglewood
Now you despise cause it came to yo surprise
Two well known enemies now becoming allies
In Californ-I-A we parlay the G way
Some wear red and black and some sport blue and gray
So gangsta's don't dance we hang boogie and bang
So it's the Westside Connect with the Dogg Pound Gang

There we have it, Ice motherfucking Cube

Got turned out early by them scandalous freaks
Addicted to crime so I stay in the mix
With a love for hoochie chicks and pulling jewelry licks
Moms said, ""Mack, baby watch for danger""
I said, ""Momma don't you know I'm a real gang banger?""
I can't switch over night and be good
And I'll be damned if a nigga turned his back on the hood
So I walked out the door, hopped in the Regal
Twisting triple gold with the all black eagle
Got a deuce fired at Scoob's, I need a gat
So I stopped and got the Tech from my G homie Wreck
He said, ""Mack, don't slip dog, u gotta stay heated
And here's the extra clip incase you might need it""

Throw the Hoo-Bang plack in the back and your ride on

More bounce to the ounce and I'm clowning
Keep the gat in my lap cause I'm fully strapped
For the car jackers, but no haps cause I pack a
Tech 9, plus a A-K 47
Send a one way ticket to my hell or maybe heaven

Don't make me laugh cause I""m on the wrong the path
Catch the blood bath, it's the aftermath
Slang strike to make money, now ain't that simple?
That silly nigga's wearing vest's but we aim for the temple
Watch my nigga's back, who sacked the yayo
Keep the calico with extra ammo
So and so gets blasted, to the casket
Never seen these west side G's face, we masked it

Everybody that was so real  they were now phony 

And the nigga that used to be my homie, shit he turned on me 

I got a 45 that spit hot lead that'll drill him

If it's time available at the shrink, man I need to spend it

[Snoop Dogg talking] 

Hahaha  yeah. 

You're about to witness something you never thought you'd witness 

before. 

Check this out. 



[Snoop Dogg] 

Welcome to the house the D O double G built 

We got honey  cream  silk and milk 

We make that big bank and keep that big shank 

Just in case we get slapped into the home we take 

Nigga don't think Dogg slips at all 

I make chips for crips and the beat dogs 

True niggas, do niggas, hey you niggas 

Can't get with us 'cause we rip shit up 

It's Mack Dime, and D-O dub 

Here's a toast to the most, westcoast love 

Fo sho though, I let you know from the get go 

Pullin on my endo, rollin through the Wood with my kin dog 



[Mack 10] 

Not De La Soul, but fresh on parole 

Now it's all about the hustle with the pebbles on swole 

I'm know to the peoples as the Inglewood swanger 

Been rollin gold Danas since a BG banger 

It's a dog eat dog world in the city that I'm claimin 

And niggas say we bangin 'cause our colors be flamin 

But I'd rather push crack, let the bank roll stack 

I show Snoop how to whoop and then I front him a sack 



[Snoop Dogg] 

Nigga better blue tennis shoes tidy, with our body 

As I fall into the Mack 10 listenin party 

Got greeted by some niggas who I never knew 

Cold thing about it is that the niggas kept it true 

Inglewood family is what they claim to bang 

Street Rue and Maddog, I think that was his name 

But anyway, what can I say? 

Oh by the way, it's anybody 'kay? 

So when you in LA, or nigga round my way 

Give me a holler on the 310 or 213, yeah 



[Hook:] X 3 

Long Beach, with the ING 



[Mack 10] 

I'm makin green in the rap scene from coast to coast 

And rollin three wheel motion from the woods to the ocean 

See Snoop and Tray Dee in the LBC 

And wasn't nobody trippin, just cool as can be 

No harm up in (?) so the hatas got bigger 

But they figure platinum niggas keep a gold plated trigger 

And that's fo sho though, you know how it go 

Jump in the low low and bang with the homies, fuck a hoe 

So keep away crack and leave your bullet proof vest 

Dogg there ain't no need for that, we headed west to the QS 

Game recognize game, and it always should 

It's all good and you niggas got a passion, Inglewood 

Whoever trip get caught up in the middle like Monie 

That's on the one and only I keep the big homies for the phonies 

So let it be known, from my hood to your town 

That connect game niggas is straight down with the Pound 



[Snoop Dogg] 

Now all my peoples in the LBC pull up a chair and have a dime bag on me 

See we be DPGin this, we in this thang to make hits and bump a 

bitch and maintain 

'cause the more better you get, the more cheddar you get 

The more shit you talk, the more wet up you get 

See, I found out quick, don't say shit 

Just take care of yours, and handle it quick 

Yeah, it don't stop for Biggie or Tupac 

Niggas been gettin shot on my block 

But we got to make a change and the thang is this 

I keep my heater by my seater just in case y'all twist 

But I wish upon a star 

To stay down with Mack Dime, pushin caviar 

The real recognize the real, I'll kill for that nigga 

ING DPG, deal with it nigga, for real 



[Hook] X 2 



[Snoop Dogg] 

They live on the streets, and they hustle for fame 

Some claim twenty crip but most claim insane 

See it's not a lifestyle, it's a full time job 

And if you live in Long Beach, it's like a macabre 

>From blunt to blunt, everybody's bad 

And if you don't know where you at you better tuck in your rag 

Push heat on the street, with Chuck D's on his feet 

Makin money slangin tapes up out the Compton swap meet 



[Mack 10] 

Up jumps the boogie some niggas gang bang 

So keep a big steel if it's a real G Thang 

But I kick back, relax, count hundreds by the stacks 

And keep the yay on the stove till the whole key cracks 

Ain't a busta in the crew, so I'm callin all hogs 

It's connect gang rollin with the Pound and Snoop Dogg 

And everythang all gravy like it's 'posed to be 

It's Long Beach with the Ingle dub O-O-D city

Mack 10,"featuring Gerald Levert 



[Mack 10] 

This song is dedicated 

to all the up and coming rappers  singers  hustlers  actors 

Whatever you may be remember: 

without no struggle  you get no progress 

So keep grindin  keep on mashin  get yours 



Chorus: Gerald Levert 



You're nothin far from comin up (keep on) 

Money's just a touch away (keep on) 

So keep on grindin don't give it up (keep on) 

There'll always be another day (keep on) 



[Mack 10] 

And now I'm sittin at the pad, teary eyed and depressed 

Starvin and sufferin from mental stress 

Now a true center to the game of beginner 

but hard to feel like a winner when you eat spreads for dinner 

Hit the streets late night in the form of star mushin 

On the 211 mission just to pay tuition 

For my kids I got to grind and develop street saavy 

Servin stress cause I just ain't got enough to cop cavi 

But I can't stop, I won't stop, til I got it made 

Either build my clientele, get a job or learn a trade 

like hip-hop, and make enough to live good forever 

So I learned to write the rhymes and get my metaphors together 

Then I joined a rap crew, with the homies on my street 

Sellin underground tapes out the local swap meet 

Gettin tighter on the mic, as I worked day to day 

So now I lay down at night, and I hear voices say, ""Mack"" 



Chorus 



[Mack 10] 

Now I'm new to the scene, H as in Hard, N as in Nympho 

So like EPMD, could you _Please Listen to My Demo?_ 

I left the local crew, felt like I was the man 

In popular demand and now ready for SoundScan 

So I searched for a deal with no luck I kept rappin 

Felt like it would take a miracle to make it all happen 

Marble said it was a test, ""Mack don't do nuttin wrong! 

Just have faith in God and keep your hustle goin strong 

Stay hongry, keep writin, don't quit you're too close 

Remember good things come to those who want it most"" 

So I never left the house, without my rap book 

Thought I found a new crew but eventually got shook 

First they said I was cool, but then started to doubt me 

Put me on the backburner and just forgot all about me 

Partna said I wasn't fresh, and sent me on my way, but you know what? 

As I was leavin, I could hear voices say, ""Mack"" 



Chorus 



[Mack 10] 

Now the tables turned, but I remember they used to clown me 

The hard work paid off, and luck finally found me 

So call every publication, Billboard and the editor 

and tell em Mack's being signed by dude workin on _The Predator_ 

I got the Midas touch, now everything be the bomb 

Hooked up with The Don, now made a few mill-ion 

I don't bang I write the good rhymes, you know about mines 

Man I'm the tightest MC, Ice Cube ever signed 

Now if ain't the radio, it's a video shoot 

Livin life in the limelight, with a bank full of loot 

Now my crew is solid, shook the haters and the leeches 

Runnin full court at my house with our girls on the beaches 

Plus the violence is ceased, no more bi-coastal beef 

Cause now I get down with the North South and the East 

I reminisce on hard times, seem like yesterday, but now 

Hoo Bangin' is official and I remember they used to say, ""Mack"" 



Chorus 



[Levert] Money's just a touch, just a simple touch 

Money's just a touch away.. 

Money's just a touch, just a simple touch 

Money's just a touch away.. 



[Mack 10] Man I knew I was gonna make it, but they didn't believe me 

YaknowhatI'msayin? Clowned me -- gon' be a rapper, what? 

Hahahaha",Money's Just a Touch Away

Yo, this one goin out to everybody in every ghetto
Turn it up and just so we accusin make sure it bumpin

This is for the straight thugged-out, the low ride pro`s
Triple O.G.`s with the hot six fo`s
Go fast ballers, bangin six gears
Three time felons with the tattooed tears
For all the homies out there that cook it up good
Distributin so up they project a neighborhood
Whether it`s Peruvian or Ghetto D
Won`t you bust down a kid and sell a ounce for me
I`m from the ghetto so the hoodrats gettin propers
Real criminals, robbers and the pit bulls squabblers
Puttin down thousands till there ain`t nothin left
cause real street riders, let em roll to the death
I like fly shit so I scramble for the pay
Rather hustle homeboy, then gangbang anyday
Was down with the truce in nine-deuce though I looted
It`s the Y2K and i`m still khacki-suited, what you thought?

 From the streets, from the streets, from the streets
Tell em where I`m from!
 From the streets

I`m like them Hot Boys, got Cash Money and hot toys
Plus them automatic things to make the pop noise
for haters that resent me, they jealous evidently
cause I flow through the city in a drop top Bentley
But hustlas like me, just stay to the grind
Pay you no mind and keep the safety off my nine
I ain`t worried about you busters, we ain`t scared to kill
I was beastin before rap, I`m a street nia for real
So check my resume and tell me what it say
I`m the same Mack from the block known for pushing yay
I claim the turf and bang the hood from a b.g.
Now I`m eight figures up, and when you see me it`s TV
Mack ain`t getting caught up in charged with murder one
When you got loose you don`t do it, you simply get it done
Now who want to test and try push around Mack 
Get this rap shit twisted and get your dome pushed back, huh??

[Chorus 2X]
[Mack 10]
Back to them O.G. gangsta for life critic piss 
See I`m insane bangin Inglewood city kids
If rap fail today I`m back to cuttin chunks 
Pushin work through the hood from down South to the Bronx
Nan they trip if they want to and get cheap thrills
Only MC with skills but not an MC with kills
And when the four kick I smash the letter pay the note
Everybody say hoe if ya love mack one-oh
Killas on my payroll`s a chain of command 
but my neighbors don`t know; think I`m a family man, ha 
I know sometime they wonder when the six four draggin
Hair braided, tatted up and I wear my pants saggin
Every room in my house stay flooded with heat
Livin in the hills but I still got tied to the street
Ain`t shit about me change worldwide, I`m respected
I`m Hoo-Bangin now but i`m still well connected, you know??

So I represent the Wood and get respect
Catch me in the club parlayin'
Taking flicks with about hundred different 'certs
Up in my mix
I never knew nothin' but the hustle
I was able to deal
What they call the root of evil
Got me living on the hills
Still rollin' chrome boy, it's on boy
You can take the boy out the hood
But not the hood out the homeboy

You wish you had my life
Living in a three point somethin' with an R&B wife
I take care of my crew
Just ask my boo
Cause if I buy me some ice
Then I lace her too
My peak position on the charts is always one
And I never leave the house without packing a gun
Remember me back in my youth
But in case you missed it
Don't mess around and get done
Gettin' this rap stuff twisted
Mack got NBA figures like I'm hoopin'
You can catch me rag 'rari scoopin'
Or either Bentley Coupin'
You need to check your girl partna
She just blew me a kiss
Look at her jockin' the ice around my neck and my wrist
Her friend came up to me and said
I didn't want to stare but it's like a hood rat dream
To get to braid your hair
I said keep it real shorty it just ain't the brains alone
It's that whole thug mentality that turns you on
Now ain't it?

Repeat 1 (2x)

And out the gararge, is the Bentley Onage
With the brains blowed out, so is the suns beeming
I got a jacket drooming and the hoes feeming
Since I'm Westside Connected I got a streets on hype
I got big deals, big squeels, big wheels, big pipes

Twenty-inches row - going get these hoes
Pinky hoes - when I roll with my negros
Be a freak about it and I'm a see about it
Speak about it, not bitch I'ma be about it

Chevy Nash and dippin at ass and king of the zaggin
Fo'-fo' macking and coat tacking
Dub the hood and I'm in blue friend at 'em
Front up the club, I'm duolete, do for talk and mack 'em trick

If lil momma dick then I gotta hit it
The trojan gotta be a magnum for me to fit it
If you sherm on 'em stick then I'd probably lit it
The red beam is on your wig so I probably split it

I think they new tricious - I think they do dishes
I make 'em three wishes - I take 'em they pictures
And spendin' they riches and fuckin' they bitches

Ice Cube's an asshole and it ain't an act
So take a hit at that - and remember that
Where my motherfuckin niggas and my bitches at?

Like a dragon it's nothin' but fire when I spit
And I can't shake these ghetto ways

And the rubber bands and brains
From the turf for the sirens and Neverlands
Where we keep the pistols smoking just like Afghanistan

[Scarface}
I got trouble rhymes to a death the troubled times
A double nine incase niggas get out of line
And heaven knows that I tried to change
But in the mist of trying to be a better man
Trouble is all I can seem to see
And the fact I know tomorrow isn`t promised to me
So from this day forth I`ll be all I can be
My brother turned his back on me
Got to be my own man
Regardless of what the stakes is I`ma play my own hand
And I`m tired of being let down by my so-called friends
Regardless to the blood shed ? no tears in the end
Father please forgive for I have sinned ? forgive us all
But I ain`t to blame ? the lunatics wearing my heart
And I think I gotta build another wall
Cause I don`t want the world to see me
Cause maybe these demons will try to end me
I`m exhausted and my body`s sleepy
Never the less it`s hard to rest ? I`m a nervous wreck
I walk with the stress
I use to walk around with a vest
But now a days I be like ""fuck it dog
You fuck with me I gots to fuck with ya`ll""
And ""make ends"" is just another word for ""pay back""
Paying you back today for this grudge that I had way back
You niggas I grew up with wouldn`t play with that
I send you bitches to the morgue with holes in your head
No remorse ? why you think my niggas taught me to ball?
Cause I be walking around in designer suits?
In fact these niggas know that I`m the truth
Always scandalous ? eye before I shoot
For disrespect there is no excuse
Calling the choices

Every time I get my hands on
I try to make you dub, with my chips wouldn't stack
Than man I wouldn't hustle
I'm legal dog - I got the same desert eagle dog
When birds fly out of my hands
And to my people dog - Ya understand
The white man can't fuck with me
I Hoo-Bang in the streets Hoo my company
Papered up beyond mother fucker's belief
A millionaire patrolling the city streets
See the flames burning in my eyes mother fucker?
Cause if you sleep on it you get these dreams mother fucker
I ain't the one like I said, ""I want it all""
And like my Conrads, time to wake up and ball
Call shots, have it ready - soft and rocked
Let all my neighbor hood fiends
Come to scrap all the pots
Let my little B.G.'s run the hood spots
And if it's funked than my killers come to shut down the block

[Mack 10 (Chorus)]
If I throw a chicken up and that bitch start flipping
Nigga that's mathematics
Over here we bloodin' and crippin' - Hoo banging and dippin'
Nigga that's mathematics
I got legal money in my account and dirty money under my mattress
Nigga that's mathematics
With my super bad bitch and my house on the hill
I can add it up for real all because of mathematics

[Mack 10]
I work for mines - let my work, work for me
I make my ends - my friends buy their work from me
Money is me - that folding on those switches is me
Went out on the seat and out with all those bitches is me
I make money while I'm sleeping
Cause money don't sleep - money is up seven days of the week
Three-sixty-five if you grind than it pays
I don't mind as long as your one-o is straight
Put some bread on this plate plus a little rate
That I give mines with a tape how to grind
I'ma leave my dent in the game like ripples
As a kid, even tried to make my lunch my triples
Stack it up, how do you think I bought that first double up?
The (?) and that other shit I hustled up - mathematics
That's just how I look at it
With enough carrots to feed a whole hood of rabbits


[Mack 10 (Chorus)]
If I throw a chicken up and that bitch start flipping
Nigga that's mathematics
Over here we bloodin' and crippin' - Hoo banging and dippin'
Nigga that's mathematics
I got legal money in my account and dirty money under my mattress
Nigga that's mathematics
With my super bad bitch and my house on the hill
I can add it up for real all because of mathematics

[Mack 10]
Everything is to the good now I'm living how I want to
I got dope around the world and got some still on the corner
If you broke come and see me, I got shit for you to do
I got a class on how to make one bird turn in two
I'm a connected shot caller - pure bread baller
All I do is try to make my money flip like quota quarters
If money is the root to all evil than I'm (?)
And money is a race on mind so I'm cheating
I don't want shit subtracted - everything added
I didn't look back for shit since I hit bird status
And now I pack clips like Glaydis with no tips
Just a whole bunch of bloods and a whole bunch of crips
And a whole bunch of bitches when I rock the microphone
And my key to success is thirty-six hard zones
With my mind on a dub, re-up and stack cabbage
And I'm a walking proof of the signs of mathematics

[Mack 10 (Chorus)]
If I throw a chicken up and that bitch start flipping

Over here we bloodin' and crippin' - Hoo banging and dippin'

Yeah nigga this CMR and Hoo-Bangin' for life

Around here and incase you didn't know nigga that's money

You ready Eiht?

[MC Eiht]
Yeah, c'mon

[Mack 10]
I was born to ride, banging, pack heat
Got turned out early by them scandalous freaks
Addicted to crime so I stay in the mix
With a love for hoochie chicks and pulling jewelry licks
Moms said, ""Mack, baby watch for danger""
I said, ""Momma don't you know I'm a real gang banger?""
I can't switch over night and be good
And I'll be damned if a nigga turned his back on the hood
So I walked out the door, hopped in the Regal
Twisting triple gold with the all black eagle
Got a deuce fired at Scoob's, I need a gat
So I stopped and got the Tech from my G homie Wreck
He said, ""Mack, don't slip dog, u gotta stay heated
And here's the extra clip incase you might need it""
Get the eighty eight skate, ang get your slide on
Throw the Hoo-Bang plack in the back and your ride on

[Chorus: x2]
Ride for me, I'ma ride for you
You Hoo-Bang, I Hoo-Bang, so we all a crew
Get yo ride on, get yo slide on, who the best
Nobody rides like these killas from the west

1, 2, 3, and to the 4
Eazy motherfucking with a chrome to your dome
Cruising, in my 6-4 rag top
I got a lot of juice, a lot of fucking block
Now when I hit that switch I'm bouncing
More bounce to the ounce and I'm clowning
Keep the gat in my lap cause I'm fully strapped
For the car jackers, but no haps cause I pack a
Tech 9, plus a A-K 47
Send a one way ticket to my hell or maybe heaven
Peep, nigga I don't sleep
Bury motherfuckers in the concrete
You try to creep kinda slow in a Astro
But I'm peeping niggas out in my left window
So I blast, and I blast, so I blast no more
Yo, they call me motherfucking John Doe

[Chorus]

[MC Eiht]
Real thugs roll cause the Westside's sick
Which enemy depicts to catch the 9 clip
Slick, but not like Rick, the gang story
G's kill and ain't shit funny like Joe Corry
Don't make me laugh cause I""m on the wrong the path
Catch the blood bath, it's the aftermath
Slang strike to make money, now ain't that simple?
That silly nigga's wearing vest's but we aim for the temple
Watch my nigga's back, who sacked the yayo
Keep the calico with extra ammo
So and so gets blasted, to the casket
Never seen these west side G's face, we masked it
Y'all best be defeat and be discreet
Catch the hot heat from across the street
Take me in the dump schools that, wanna push me
Retaliation, straight better than hitting pussy

I told her plenty of times I think you losin' it
I hope I don't have to shoot the bitch
That's comin' straight from the heart
'Cause I told her the real nigga straight from the start
I'm through with your ass and please believe you got a replacement
And about the situation it ain't no conversation in it

Bitch, you was just somethin' to do know that
Plus your mental fit the description of how a hoe acts
It musta been the life in the fast lane
'Cause you was overwhelmed with how fast the cash came
The pussy was bomb for that you stuck around
All the while you knew my style and now I fucked around
You know, how I treat hoes, I pick and I choose
Thinkin' I move, but yo ass singin' them blues like

And I ain't sip trippin dog, that's a thing of the past
And I stay in good shape so my stamina last
And put hands on a motherfucker bout my cash
I was a stick up kid, I snatch your chain and dash
And if the pawn shop wanted it I bound it fast
Or I'm creepin through your window breakin out your glass
Then I rob the whole party lookin through a ski-mask, c'mon

Park the GT Bentley and pull out the Phantom Rolls,
And I pack the kinda heat that you can't expose,
So my stash box enclosed with Fo'Fo's and calicos,

If the Devil wasn't alive, Mack would be stressed
Riding around town in a bulletproof vest
Police everywhere amour cars and shh
Worried about being another victim of a hit

But my relationship too strong for real I'm a saint
A child of God and if you hate me then you ain't
Be the only G I know to take it all with no triggers
So I put my faith in Him and never no niggas

As a result of that I'm cool, seem like I'm never nervous
So catch me Sunday mornings in that 8:30 service
Told me ride with me son and I'll never leave you lonely
Yeah, troubles for a reason, 'cause now you got a testimony

Most people get outrageous when they hit they knees
But I'm a thank you for the simple things the grass and the trees
I'm grateful for everything my fame and good wealth
I'm blessed with good money but most of all with good health

God, if they don't think I'm sincere, they don't know me, never knew me
And I tear up every time I think how good You been to me
I should of lost a few times and walked away without any pay
But I got favored with You and You gave it to me anyway

So when you blind in a situation believe, He can show you
And if you ever need a hug then just believe He can hold you
So turn to the Lord for He's the best to consult you
And that's the realest thing that Mack 10 ever told you

It was up close and personal a lot for a kid to see
All the stuff I been through how could I not be a G

I know you got a purpose for me, it ain't no if ands or maybes
God in case I never told You, I want to thank You for my babies
Although I'm a gangster, rapper I'm pretty smart and well rounded
I never sell my soul and I promise to stay grounded

He said all you got to do is just speak it and believe it
And everything I prayed for, I eventually receive it
While the Devil work overtime, the suckers stay doubting You
I'm aware of all my blessings and I know I'm nothing without You

Life is driving me crazy
Everything ain't all gravy
If it ain't one thing, it's another
Why me, I believe in karma
So I know that answer is coming back on me

When we were born we were just wrapped up with favor
Didn't say we were perfect, didn't say we didn't make mistakes
Didn't say we didn't put up a little bit

I wish I had somebody in here that knew you were highly in favor

In the end not only did He give you favor

Mack Bailey,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty
Mack Bailey,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

My heart and I agree,
Shes everything on this earth to me.

Mack Maine,"I see your dirty face, high behind your collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time and you do your crime
Well you made your bed, I'm in mine

[Chorus]
Because when I arrive
I bring the fire, make you come alive
I can take you higher what this is, forgot?
I must now remind you let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world to the world
And you take your time and you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours, I got mine

Yeah! Wayne's world
Planet Rock, panties drop
And the tops and she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (rock) and Pamela (rock)
And Samantha (rock) and Amanda and Tamara 
I'm in here up like bitch what's up
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can fuck you up, I can fuck you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground, Weezy

Just let it rock
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll fuck ya, period, like the reminder

Pop a bottle and celebrate
We done made it to a new day
Oh I take a hit and just elevate
'Cause today will be a good day
I got my mind right, money right, ready for war

Hey! - blow the horns on 'em
The sun is out, it's a brand new day and it just dawned on 'em
The smoke in here got 'em floating just like in salt water
And break is fast, we got it cooking just like a short order
Go feed the hands birds cover the cheetah print
A jungle out there and the jail is the zoo that keep us in
Players in gators is crazy, we feel the need to rock 'em
Furs coming in all different colors like PETA got 'em
Killing yourself for a salary
Look ya line flatter than stomachs of the women that's running, watching them calories
Hope that we linking, we smoking and drinking casually
'Cause life without living ain't nothing but a fallacy

[Chorus]

Say, who's that peekin' in my window?
Is that sunshine? Is that one time?
Let that sun shine through my living room
Hospitality is what I'm giving you
Harsh reality is what I've been through
But I'm not alone, ask her and him too
And they shall tell ya, ain't nothin' better
Than the smell of a new day
I know the ocean runs dry and the sky gets dark
And ya don't see what He's trying to show ya
And I know the wall may seem tall
But if we help each other I guarantee we get over
And once I'm over, I'll reach back for my brother
And pull him over as well
Keep our heads high and our noses wide open
Hopin' for that new day smell

[Chorus]

Yea homie, I been? since I was 16
To tell 'em what I'm 'bout to tell 'em
So I need more than a 16
See I'm the only son of Mary and Joe
So I gotta fulfill my purpose 'fore I'm buried, ya know
My momma say she having visions of me being a missionary
And the hood looking at me as a walking visionary
So I sit back and wonder will I ever have my time to shine
And die like Pac in his prime
Or will I go out like Len Bias and OD before the tryouts
No teller no reaper no buyout
I'm good, I pray for a head to protect ya
And I gotta walk the streets with the heat as my protection
Still gotta watch my back, still watch my front home
'Cause I seen a lot of n-ggas die with they gun on
So with that in mind, I just get higher
And pray to the higher Messiah, I'm no liar
And they say that puffing the fire f-cks with your memory
But I got a lot of stuff that I don't wan' remember see
Like when my homie ivin died
I like how I never seen a man cry 'til I seen Lance died
Never seen my pops cry 'til I seen my Grams died
And I'm here to tell him that I miss my Grams too
And I wish I could hug her for mothers day too
And I feel the same way that you do
But we gotta still move on so she can just smile down on us
And I don't want the Lord to ever frown down on us
I know that they really got power in a gun
But I also know that they got power in a tongue
So every time I speak, look I try to speak life
Y'all tweaking for broads, I tweak life
They said I was s'posed to die as a fetus
My momma said I bind that Devil in the name of Jesus
So now I'm here just to talk to y'all
Come and stroll with me homie, let me walk wit' y'all
Ten million ways to die so I chose
To get my life right by the end of the road
'Fore my body in a casket and I'm stiff and froze
'Fore I'm laying in a morgue with a tag on my toes
I'm here to tell you take heed to the warnings
School shootings, hurricanes, and global warming
Open ya Bibles up with no hesitation
BC was the Genesis, this is Revelations
So you better pick your destination
Tomorrow ain't promised, better pick your destination
Rest in peace B Spencer, rest in peace?
Shit could be worse so I'm feeling like Weezy
I wake up in the morning, take a piss, and wash my hands
Take a knee and thank the Man and leave my life in God's hands, yea!

So we ball and pop champagne and wait
See I've never been a drinker but a nigga taste
But I'm fine fly guy just to taste ya
Any place wanna be taken
In my mind all I see is dollars and lace
This bad chick just started waving
The crowed running as I make my way
I said hey little mama come before danger
You come around the more I want just a day
The way you looking got me wanting to play
Where are you from so tell me where do you stay

The wild things, the wild things
The wild things, the wild things

Come along I tell you a story of greatness
A young nigga want me to stay
From the niggas would frown down in hating
The clown and pussy niggas scared the same
All around the kids hang around and play
5 rounds and you never came
Couple million but he never made it
It's a nightmare thinking that you were famous
Excuse me cutie oh you want the same
You're sounding like a ? I need a day
The way you looking got me wanting to play
Where are you from now tell me where do you stay

The wild things, the wild things
The wild things, the wild things

Come from the crown side
The New York town side
West side till I di-e
I grew up hearing that Wu-not
Watching that cop that
You feel like cooking this
Hercules get a hand God damn
Nigga y'all be cupped to make some rain rat
My whole hood jumping out
Yes I did that
Why these ladies wanna cover on my balls back
Skin rebel smooth like butter
Coming from the city where most blocks is amended
We believed there was no need for change
Believe the change and wash it arrange
Pop shot popping only means one thing

Macklemore,"Ladies and gentlemen
This an ode to the B-boys, B-girls
The people out there who do it for the love
And believe me I'm not dissin' anybody out there who's trying to get paid
I'm trying to get paid too!
But I got one question

Whatever happened to the heart?
That pumped the passion into the art?
The entity that gave you the energy to wanna start?
Breakdancing, I'm battling, doing it at the park
Where the mission was expression, not only to top charts
I don't know what happened, wanting to blow rap
You lose soul and passion for the flows and the tracks
Radio's lacking, controlled by fascists, assholes doing damage
But we're gonna take it back
Before beats to a hundred G's a pop
All you needed was a tabletop and a beatbox
Hip-hop without the B-boy is like shelltoes only having two stripes
Hip-hop, we're freedom-fighting, graffiti-writing, party types
That recite and organize and revitalize our rhyming
'Til the group of the moneymakers systems
Knows that the industry can eventually get served
Breakers of my verses spinning up a revolution throughout our words
If you really want it, come on get it, 'cause I've got it
I'm honestly paying homage to forgotten pioneers of this culture that are giving them props and learn
If you wanna earn your stripes
You gotta be able to rock this mic and set cyphers alike
The feeling to put in everything you got in the circle
Will never be documented in the Coke commercial

We be the baddest

Now B-boys, B-girls
Bring it back to the block
Lemme see you get ill, for real, pop and lock!
If you record without thought then stop
Because I'll serve your whole album with the goddamn beatbox
Without thought it just happens
If you gotta think to feel, that's not rapping, that's acting
I'm from a land of backpacks and fat cats
Mcs with sick raps who serve those that are wack
It's a way of life
I put all my energy into the melody
On the MPC until the death of me
Record exceptionally, especially
Whenever I be monumentally, grammatically, killing the mic
I tell my DJs, cranking that music, keeping 'em moving when the beat plays
Staying into it, breaking and grooving, and MCs they
Thinking that you should always pursue in what their dreams make
Taking from lucid to really do it
All the people gotta make their money
And the way to make money is to get inside of the industry
Take it on the radio, blow so
Even go blow, we get a car and a crib up on MTV
But in the end what's classic?
Radio bubblegum? Or a voice filled with passion?
To my real hip-hop heads, please stand up
'Cause the only people that can preserve this art is us (seen)

Macklemore,"And we drink and get older
And some of us even try to get sober
Now here's to the assholes and the last calls
Well city kids, you get what you ask for

And acquaintances turn to friends, I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those ears as the centerpiece

Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

Hold on to what you were, forget what you're not
The streets were ours that summer, at least those two blocks
Reminisce on those days, I guess that's OK, you wonder why
Some grow up, move on, close the chapter, live separate lives
The twenty-something confusion before the suit and tie
Strangers become mistakes but those mistakes make you feel alive
Hindsight is vibrant, reality: rarely lit
Memories to collage, paste to the glue that barely sticks
Good Lord, they broke all my shields
Locked bathroom doors, graffiti, and high heels
Until you felt that altitude you don't know how high feels
Party mountain, some don't ever come down from around here
To be young again, I guess it's relative
The camera lights, the whiskey rise, sink into the skin
I fantasize about a second win
Grow a mustache, pick up another bad habit and let the games begin

Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

So here's to the nights, dancing with the band
Strangers into girlfriends from a one night stand
Brought a little liquor and turn up the Johnny Cash
You could bring a receipt to Heaven but you cannot take it back
And this is life, this is real, even when it feels like it isn't
I'd be a goddamn liar to say at times I didn't miss it
So deuces, I turn my back as I walk into the distance
Dip my feet in every once in a while, just to say I visit
And we hold onto these nights
Trying to find out way home by the street light
Over time we figure out this is me, right
Learn a lot about your friends right around two A.M

And acquaintances turn to friends, I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those ears as the centerpiece

Macklemore,"Everything is gold, everything is equal
Posted on the porch just chillin', me and my people
Eyelids closed, gold sun shines on
The world’s coated in the gold Krylon
Yea, and these days days days
They never run away
Gold tints, shades, that block out that golden haze
Take all the gold from the pawnshop that lives behind the case
And get to give it away
My gold erupted from volcano's in the heavens
And every shrine that existed in time melting
Tombs open, Dookie Ropes on the bells
When everything is gold, who cares about the carats?
They say that gold's the skin of the gods
You can’t take the band there when you’re gone
Now I’ll tip over that kiosk in the mall
As the sunset falls into tomorrow

Today we’re feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, row fun, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toe
Ghost slowly faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

Five hundred thousand soul
Slick rick gold, row fun, hella cold
Yea we’re feeling like gold
So fresh head to toe
Ghost slowly faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

Alright now we open up that car door
Hop out, hope they notice us
Throughout society we been locked in that cobra clutch
More gold bottles, gold bottles, never sober up
Ditch Jesus, In gold I Trust
I solemnly swear to wear my cross and stunt
Separate myself by sticking out just because
That’s how you illustrate power and who you’re above
But nah, tonight we take it, take it, giving it back
Crack open the vault, let everyone mob in the bank
Take whatever they want, we party and give thanks
I've been rocking gold chains since pee was in the tank
You only live once, you only live once
Watch Rick Ross give his Jesus piece to a bum
'Cause tonight we ball, we ball, we comin’ up
Paintin' the globe gold, two steppin’ on the sun

Like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, row fun, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toe
Ghost slowly faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

Oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Today we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Gold coins, gold phone, gold car
Costs at least 10 racks to get 16 gold bars
Gold rush, suck on my gold dust stuntin'
Under these gold trunks, that’s 2 golden nugget
Flyin' on the gold eagle, flier than the rest of ‘em
Passing space needle, golden shower on pedestrians
Excuse me, that’s my bad, that’s my eagle and he shouldn’t of
My eagle got hair, that motherfucker got a mullet bruh
And it’s gold, two girls gold brass
Lounging on the water, feet in the gold sand
Sipping on Orangina, arms around them both pants
They’re sipping Olde English right out of a gold can
Two girls, gold spandex so pretty
That girl ain’t even gold, she just got golden girl titties
I’m kidding, everyone is gold in my city
You paint Betty White gold, even Betty White can get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it

Today we’re feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, row fun, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toe
Ghost slowly faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

Five hundred thousand sold

Macklemore,"I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
'Cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it

I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, I need all that shit

If I just went in and stole it, the police would of notice
Gotta be strategic, creepin', go in, leave with that motive
Hold up, my plan is forming, alright, caseing this building
Watch these rappers that rappin' walk in and leave out with millions
Headed in sweatin', open that front door
Interscope printed out right by the entrance, door closes
Not a metaphor, then I start towards
That front, that’s right, where you check in
Dressed in an uniform, acting like a janitor
All blue, jumpsuit, why shoot?
Bloodthirsty for the money like a bull
Looking in the eyes of the matador (fuck you!)
Carrying 2 cans of paint, security looks at me awkward
I say third floor i’m late, paintin' jimmy iovine's office
Holding my breath ‘bout to faint
I’m scared to death that he stops me
Heart beating so loud you can hear the echo in that lobby
And see I'm breaking down if I don’t make it out
Then i’m leaving town with that contract
And i’m spazzing out, grabbin' the a&r out
His chair and i’m taking him hostage
I don’t give a fuck, step into the elevator press 3
Now i’m headed up (heist!)
What they don't know is there is a gun in the paint can
And i’m ready and willing to bust ‘em, I'm fucking desperate
Stuck in this recession, now what you think
If I could get signed my life is destined
My future depends on ink
And secretary at the front of the entrance staring right at me
I walk up she whispers go ahead and then gives me a wink

I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
'cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it

I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, I need all that shit

If I get past security, the secretary, the cubicals
But it’s weird, it’s like this room i’ve walked into is unusual
Thought it would be shiny and beautiful
Thought it would be alive and like musical
But it feels like someone died, it’s got the vibe of a funeral
There’s numbers on a chalkboard
Cds boxed in cardboard
Artists that flopped, that got dropped and never got to be sophomores
Graphic designers are sitting around
Waiting for albums that never come out
Complainin’ that they have nobody in house
Wonderin’ what they make art for
I start thinking, am I in the right place?
Just walk forward, see plaques on the wall
Oh yea, in a second those will be all yours
Finally see an office with a mounted sign, heaven sent
Big block silver letters, read it out loud: president (nice!)
This was my chance to grab that contract and turn and jet
Right then felt a cold hand grab on the back of my neck
He said: we’ve been watching you, so glad you could make it
Your music gets so impressive in this whole brand you created
You're one hell of a band, we here think you’re destined for greatness
And with that right song we all know that you’re next to be famous
Now i’m sorry, i’ve had a long day remind me, now what your name is?
That’s right, macklemore, of course, today has been crazy
Anyway, you ready? we’ll give you a hundred thousand dollars
After your album comes out we’ll need back that money that you borrowed
So it’s really like a loan, a loan? come on, no
We're a team, 360 degrees, we will reach your goals!
We’ll get a third of the merch that you sell out on the road
Along with a third of the money you make when you’re out doing your shows
Manager gets 20, booking agent gets 10
So shit, after taxes you and ryan have 7% to split
That’s not bad, i’ve seen a lot worse, no one will give you a better offer than us (hmm)
I replied I appreciate the offer, thought that this is what I wanted
Rather be a starving artist than succeed at getting fucked",Jimmy Iovine
Macklemore,"Now, this is my job, I will not quit it
Pulled me out the depths when I thought that I was finished
Yeah I questioned if I could go the distance
That's just the work, regardless of who's listening, listening
Listen, see I was meant to be a warrior
Fight something amongst me, leave here victorious
Classroom of kids, or a venue performing
If I'd had done for the money I'd have been a fucking lawyer
Concrete, vagabond, van telling stories
Humbled by the road, I'm realizing I'm not important
See life's a beautiful struggle, I record it
Hope it helps you maneuvering through yours and
That's why we stay in the lab at night
I've been staring into this pad for over half my life
A true artist won't be satisfied
So I guess that's the sacrifice
And I say

Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true
I say,
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true

Forget about the fame, fortune and the mansion
Sitting and tripping watching myself on a plasma
Yeah, I start slipping when I'm thinking about that stuff
Ego won't swole until the karma catches that up, that up
I'm my grandma's number one grandson
I lost myself to remember who that was
We start thinking about some kicks, a necklace
What I really need is a job off Craigslist
Take away the dot com, name, love
Fans, twitter followers, and the buzz
See, you keep the issues but you take away the drugs
And I had to find out who I really was
Who I really wasn't
So sick of who I was becoming
Yeah, tired of running
Time to look at the man in the mirror until I can learn to love him

Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true
I said,
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true

Of course, I want dubs and a candy painted 'lac
Watch the videos and get the girls in the back
But if that's what I believe in, and the reason that I rap
Uncle Sam is my pimp when he puts me on the track

Uhm
1, 2, now

Round here they sing broken hymns
The prayers flow better when I’m soaked they're gin
The air is rusty and sits in the corner
Bad bartender that’ll pickpocket your heart
And a jukebox that’ll steal your quarter
Bartender, please give me a confession
Exchange fear for courage in the form of a well drink
There’s a heavy current, got a long way to swim
Closed the Bible a while ago, I need some shots for this sin
Hail Mary, come with me, feel like Pac when it hits
Got some fire in my belly and a riot in the gut
Bushmills for a band-aid, the sweet taste of blood
Then I might actually feel something if I don’t cover it up
Watch their faces, familiar places
Even if they didn’t left the vinyl booth that they stayed in
The motel next door, a sign that reads vacant
And a truth that’s so strong I’d be a fool not to chase it
But yea, I’m a fool and I stay here
Hope these problems bail themselves, I die in wait here
One more, four more, fuck it a night cap
Service starts at 5 tomorrow and I’ll be right back

Underneath this fragile frame
Lives a battle between pride and shame
But I’ve misplaced that sense of fight
This crown of thorns has punched the top my spine
But listen closely as I testify
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night

I read the Bible but I forgot the verses
The liquor store is open later than the churches
Pure by their imperfections, everything is burning
To hell with the confessions, oh the Lord immerses
Blessed in holy water, the sin of Holy Father
Have you ever smelled bless that smells atmonic Vodka
11 AM in the morning and you can’t get it off ya
Comment to the preacher but it’s like the pastor isn’t talking
Until the store opens I can read up on that doctrine
The people close to me say I’m in need of a doctor
Think that I got a problem but these are not apostles
This the drink of the Lord, that’s according to my gospel
Open to interpretation, if you’re judging it I don’t want it
I got tins that scole like my throat when I hit the bottle
And I’m sinking and that’s why I keep on drinking
I need a refill, bar more than once every weekend
Sweet Jesus, I’m getting amnesia
Shaking til I’d get a taste, my faith is having seizures
Every time I walk away and try to leave it
Every time I walk away and try to leave it

Wouldn’t miss it for the world
Baptized in my vices and the bar is my church
Traded my artist and I pawned off the easel
Spend it all searching for God at the neon cathedral

Macklemore,"When I was in the 3rd grade I thought that I was gay 'cause I could draw,
My uncle was and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face, she's like,
""Ben you've loved girls since before pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like ""Yeah, I'm good a little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those who like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think its a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition. Playing God
Ahh nah, here we go
America the brave
Still fears what we don't know And God loves all his children it's somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written 3,500 hundred years ago
I don't know

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the Youtube comments lately
""Man that's gay"" Gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yeah, we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word routed in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that lead people to walk-outs and sit-ins,
It's human rights for everybody
There is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church, they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service Those words aren't anointed
And that Holy Water, that you soak in is then poisoned
When everyone else Is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans, that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same But that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal
Damn right I support it

I don't know

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

We press play Don't press pause
Progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Till the day That my uncles can be united by law
Their kids are walkin' around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper
Isn't gonna solve it all, but it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us
We have to change us. Whatever God you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear
Underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried

Macklemore,"One, two, now
Those 3 plus years, I was so proud of
And I threw ‘'em all away for 2 Styrofoam cups
The irony, everyone will think that he lied to me
Made my sobriety so public, there's no fuckin' privacy
If I don't talk about it then I carry a date
08-10-08, but now it's been changed in every
When they put me in some boxes that say
That I never was, it's the false prophet that never came
And will they think that everything that I written has all been fake
Oh well I'll just take my slip to the grave
Uh, what the fuck are my parents gonna say?
The success story that got his life together and changed
And you know what pain looks like
When you tell your dad you relapsed and look him directly into his face
The seep on your shoulder's the seemingly heavy weight
I haven't seen tears like this on my girl
In a while the trust that I once built's been betrayed
But I'd rather live telling the truth than be judged for my mistakes
Them falsely held up, give em props, loved and praised
I guess I gotta get this on the page

Feeling sick and helpless, lost the compass where self is
I know what I gotta do and I can't help it
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I gotta find a way to tell them
God help 'em
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I gotta find a way to tell them

We fell so hard
Now we gotta get back what we lost, lost
I felt you'd go
But you were with me all along along

And every kid that came up to me
And said I was the music they listened to when they first got clean
Now look at me, a couple days sober
I'm fighting demons
Back of that meeting on the east side
Shaking tweakin', hope that they don't see it
Hope that no one is looking
That no one recognizes that failure under that hoodie

If they call on me I'm passing, if they talk to me I'm booking out that door
But before I can make it somebody stops me and says are you Macklemore?
Maybe this isn't the place or time
I just wanted to say that if it wasn't for other side I wouldn't have made it
I just look down at the ground and say thank you
She tells me she has 9 months and that she's so grateful
Tears in her eyes, looking like she's gonna cry fuck!
I barely got 48 hours, treated like I'm some wise monk
I wanna tell her I relapsed but I can't
I just shake her hand and tell her congrats
Get back to my car and I think I'm tripping yea
'Cause God wrote Otherside, that pen was in my hand
I'm just a flawed man, man I fucked up up
Like so many others I just never thought I would
I never thought I would, didn't pick up the book
Doin' it by myself, didn't turn out that good

If I can be an example of getting sober
Then I can be an example of starting over

Macklemore,"Uh, I hope that God decides to talk through him
That the people decide to walk with him
Regardless of Pitchfork cosigns I've jumped
Make sure the soundman doesn't cock block the drums
Let the snare knock the air right out of your lungs
And those words be the oxygen
Just breathe
Hey man, regardless I'ma say it
Felt like I got signed the day that I got an agent
Got an iTunes check, shit man I'm paying rent
About damn time that I got out of my basement
About damn time I got around the country and I hit these stages
I was made to slay them
Ten thousand hours I'm so damn close I can taste it
On some Malcolm Gladwell, David Bowie meets Kanye shit
This is dedication
A life lived for art is never a life wasted
Ten thousand

Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand ants
Ten thousand ants, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand ants
Ten thousand ants, they carry me

Now, now, now
This is my world, this is my arena
The TV told me something different I didn't believe it
I stand here in front of you today all because of an idea
I could be who I wanted if I could see my potential
And I know that one day I'ma be him
Put the gloves on, sparring with my ego
Everyone's greatest obstacle, I beat him, celebrate that achievement
Got some attachments, some baggage I'm actually working on leaving
See, I observed Escher, I love Basquiat
I watched Keith Harring, you see I study art
The greats weren't great because at birth they could paint
The greats were great 'cause they paint a lot
I will not be a statistic, just let me be
No child left behind, that's the American scheme
I make my living off of words
And do what I love for work
And got around 980 on my SATs
Take that system, what did you expect?
Generation of kids choosing love over a desk
Put those hours in and look at what you get
Nothing that you can hold, but everything that it is
Ten thousand

Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand ants
Ten thousand ants, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand ants
Ten thousand ants, they carry me

Same shit, different day, same struggle
Slow motion as time slips through my knuckles
Nothing beautiful about it, no light at the tunnel
For the people that put the passion before them being comfortable
Raw, unmedicated heart no substitute
Banging on table tops, no subs to toot
I'm feeling better than ever man, what is up with you?
Scraping my knuckles, I'm battling with some drug abuse
I lost another friend, got another call from a sister
And I speak for the people that share that struggle too
Like they got something bruised
My only rehabilitation was the sweat, tears and blood when up in the booth

It's the part of the show where it all fades away
When the lights go to black and the band leaves the stage
And you wanted an encore but there's no encore today
'Cause the moment is now, can't get it back from the grave

And on on, and on, and on we go
We love who we are but now it's gone
Let's leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

Same city, yeah, we can't break up
Nice mask on, wear the same one
The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled
Was convincing women that they looked
Better in their makeup
I wear war paint, fight to the casket
Too tired to apologize on this mattress
Emotional detachment, what's the matter?
She's learning that she never should have
Dated a rapper
I don't blame her, my mind is gone
I'm at dinner, checking phone calls
Texts & blogs
I don't hear a word, I know nothing at all
Just concerned about the world
Memorizing these songs

Goes on and on
Don't wanna break you
But I'm leading you on
On, on, on, on
And now it's gone

And on on, and on, and on we go
And on on, and on, and on we go
We love who we are but now it's gone
Let's leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
This time we know we know
It's over, over

Didn't believe in love until we fell out
Gave the keys back, now I'm on the homie's couch
Always going out, sleeping ‘round with strangers
Danger! But you can't live without her
Now you're paranoid, checking on her cellphone
Making sure she ain't like you alone
Haven't made love with the lights still on
It's like you're hiding something from me

Let's fake another toast to the good life
Predict the future, clean slate, blue sky
Fantasy, I see me husband, you wife
Lyin', staring into those two eyes
And I can't take it, back to where we came from
My pavement, past the emotional earthquake foundation
Yeah, let's keep swimming in the snake pit
Get bit, get out then jump back into the suffocation
Make up and fuck to save us like we got this
Come on, this is just us baby
And this is just a fight, this is just love, maybe
Is it just you or am I fucking crazy?
I swear to god, I wish that I could Photoshop the scars off
Cold world and get all my heart throbbed
And I said it all and never get lock jaw
Mouth is a saw, a shock at any second could pop off
How does the truth taste?
My job comes with complimentary toothpaste
Lately, I've been living up out of my suitcase
Building trust in that I'm leaving on Tuesday
Bought a one night stand, just a bootleg
A duplication of something authentic
Heart augmented, and it's so hard to end it
I said peace before but this time I meant it

Can't get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less

Can't get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less

And on on, and on, and on we go
And on on, and on, and on we go
We love who we are but now it's gone

They say thirty is the new twenty
And twenty is the new thirty shit I guess
Makes sense, cause fifteen year olds seem twenty
And twenty five year olds seem ten
I used to drink away my paycheck
Celebrate the mistakes I hadn't made yet
Our generation isn't the best on safe sex
We forget the latex, becoming Planned Parenthood patients
Synthetic heroin is the new basshead
So much to escape, fuck a straight edge
Walk around looking through a fake lens
Apps this good, whose got time to make friends?
I wish I didn't care
Acynical hispters with long hair
Cocaine problems, like my music
It's not my issue, I can't solve it

My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
Eyes open, awake for the very first time
We both forfeit this game of crime

They say it's so refreshing to hear somebody on records
No guns, no drugs, no sex, just truth
The guns that's America, the drugs are what they gave to us
And sex sells itself, don't judge her 'til it's you
Ah, I'm not more or less cautious
The rappers rappin' 'bout them strippers up on the pole, copping
These interviews are obnoxious
Saying that it's poetry is so well spoken, stop it
I grew up during Reaganomics
When Ice T was out there on his killing cops shit
Or Rodney King was getting beat on
And they let off every single officer
And Los Angeles went and lost it
Now every month there is a new Rodney on Youtube
It's just something our generation is used to
And neighbourhoods where you never see a news crew
Unless they're gentrifying, white people don't even cruise through
And my subconscious telling me stop it
This is an issue that you shouldn't get involved in
Don't even tweet, R.I.P Trayvon Martin
Don't wanna be that white dude, million man marchin'
Fighting for our freedom that my people stole
Don't wanna make all my white fans uncomfortable
But you don't even have a fuckin' song for radio
Why you out here talkin race, tryin' to save the fuckin' globe
Don't get involved with the causes in mind
White privilege, white guilt, at the same damn time
So we just party like it's nineteen ninty nine
Celebrate the ignorance while these kids keep dying

My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around

Can’t see me through my tints (Nah ah)
I’m riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint wet drippin shorty like my 24’s (Umbrella)
I ain’t got 24’s (No oh)
But I’m on those Vogues
That’s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like old English in that brown paper bag
I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, Damn y’all mad
30k on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

I Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m blowin’ that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Man I’m lounging in some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? I’m legally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking bucking them out here
I’m like go fuckin their tastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whippin’ but never one like this
Old school, old school, Candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, There’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really want a Ducati so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car, junior, problem with this geezer
Got the keys in and as I was leaving I started screaming

I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m blowin’ that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snorting coke
She doing line after line like she’s writing rhymes
I had it hella my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin’, my uncle was on
14 years out so excuse me and my niggas was gone
Sendin’ portions of his liquor, water in the Patron
Rather smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it in the 4-2
Most of the mayonnaise, keeping the buns on ‘em
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin like we ball
Tryna fuck em all, kill the fuckin wimps
See what’s poppin’ at the mall, meet a bad bitch
Slap her booty with my palms, you can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I’m motherfuckin’ off
Son, swear these eyes tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes, maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low? This shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cool with niggas, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted for showing gangstas in it
Slice off when the gas is finished, Q

Dance parties in the name of Great Britain
And American girls who love a Detroit Piston

And a ping-pong pink schlong, let's all dance!

With both toes poking out of two holes
In the Eskimo socks, I'm hot

Wearing sweatpants in a sauna

I'm motherfuckin' Raven Bowie and here's my cock
Rooster, Cock-a-doodle-doo sir
Take a hit of the hooka, now make it drop

Girl's booty was bigger than the stomach of Rick Ross
Holy mother mountain of tender tendon to get lost in
Bounce, bounce, that castle booty, that bottom

Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?

That sawdust that pine sol and the moss
Around every spring when the winter thaw
We'd huddle around the radio twist the broken knob
710 AM no KJR Dave Niehaus voice would echo throughout the yard
Couldn't have been older than 10
But to me and my friends
The voice on the other end might as well have been God's

Edgars up to bat
Bottom of the 11th inning got the whole town listening,
Swung on and belted the words that started, Joey Cora rounds third
Here comes Griffey the throw to the plate's not in time
My oh my the Mariners win it
Yes, fire works they lit up ceiling in the king dome
We had just made history.

And swung, Lined down the left field line for a base hit!
Here comes Joey! Here comes Junior to third base!
They're gonna wave him in! the throw to the plate will be'.
Late! The Mariners are going to play
For the American League Championship!
I don't believe it! It just continues! MY OH MY!

Laces woven barley holdin' that stitch
The creases are time amongst the grime and the grit
Where the leather he used to pound his fists
To some it's just a mitt, but see that glove was him
Yep, tell me stories on the field with that sun stained brim
Blood under my chin, he taught me how to spit
Sunflower seeds back when me and my crew sun burnt arms
Big league chew, yeah we were like the sand lot after dinner
After practice we listen to the M's in the kitchen
And if mom wasn't trippin' come on dad
Please I swear just one more inning
Voice went pump pump through the system break out the Rye bread
It's grand salami time

Childhood my life watchin' Griffey right under those lights

Under that light rain gleaming in that night came, can't stop now
Keep moving no break pads came here to prove a point,
Live my life on the field
Make history in between the base path
And compete against the fear that is in me
That's my only barrier and I swear I'm going to break that
From the mud the cleats that we drug threw the feet
This is that moment and you cannot take it back
And I don't really collect cards anymore,
Just a box and some old card board
Memories embedded in the dust,
In the fighters that age just like us
Livin' some where off in the drawer
This is what you make of it yeah we play to win
Live it like we're under the lights of the stadium

I was just a little shorty hoping that I could find a bum to buy a 40 for me
And have enough for a bud sack
Yeah, and I dance on that instrumental
Unorthodox like Basquiat with the pencil
Give me a microphone and a beat box I could vent to
Music the only medium that I could find myself through
Recluse, sipping on some lean I would let loose
Looking in the mirror, watching myself lose
Cleaned up in '08, got a job making barely minimum wage
To get into that page
Hit the road with RL, performing in front of 8 people
And that shit will check your ego
About around that time I'm watching that EP go
From nothing to getting us booked around the country
I know no limits, life can change in an instant
Eight people turn into sold out shows in a minute
And I'm watching my pops in the back row grinning
With his glass up to my mom, toasting this Guinness

Last year thinking to myself like
Yah, nah, I won't win it yet
Probably won't get it, but I'm gonna give it everything
Play my position
The next 11 months I gave it all everything I had in me
Left blood, sweat, tears in every god damn city
No label, no deal, no publicist, indie
Just music that connected and fans that rode with me
Throw me a gold mine, and a co-sign
While you're riding a couple dope rides
Two women, both dimes
Not gonna lie, that shit sounds so nice
But I got creative control and my souls mine
I wouldn't trade it, maybe I'm crazy
I put on for my city
Seattle that raised me
Rule four thousand eighty, it's really not changing
Now a days make good music, the people are your label

I do a handstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, that ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, you need to slow down
Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down
If I only had one helmet I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit

Downtown, downtown (downtown)
Downtown, downtown
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that will keep her safe
Have you ever felt the warm embrace
Of the leather seat between your legs
Downtown
You don't want no beef, boy
Know I run the streets, boy
Better follow me towards
Downtown
What you see is what you get girl
Don't ever forget girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're

Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"I never won the spelling bee
I could read people's energy
Listen to what have been said to me
Heard the voices in elementary
That I wouldn't amount to anything
Oh girl, she used to vent to me
Like, if we just had a nice house and a mortgage
And a front lawn, and a fuckin' wedding ring
I danced in paris
I swam in oceans, felt the scales
Put my cd in starbucks, it did not sell
Get the cd out my car, turned it into myself
These piano keys hold some weight
In a bolo tie I escort my date
She ordered shrimp scampi on a porcelain plate
The accordion played, I put my fork in a steak
Afternoons need a coffee boost
Attitude needs a confidence boost
Yeah, I'm sort of the dude
But where's the self-esteem when the costumes removed? 
Thanks for the invite, can't make it
I could blame it on a flight to vegas
But, truth be told, rather not socialize
And go and waste my time with an acquaintance
These relationships need maintenance
Everybody got expectations
Text back, so impatient
Where were you when I was in in-patient? 

Motherfucker you ain't my accountant
You don't know what I'm doing
Focusing on what I'm giving back
Man, make better music
Fuck preaching on top of the mountain, people can see through it
Keeping my name in your mouth, just don't bite your tongue while you chew it

Exactly I got the man of the year
Source magazine was like our vanity fair
In a mansion, picking out a chandelier 
But got a bone to pick with the man in the mirror
Questioning the purchase while I'm standing there
Questioning the purpose of my rap career
Thinking ""man, what the hell happened here?""
Fells like yesterday in a van packing gear
What am I gonna go and give back this year? 
There's a whole lot of struggling rappers here
Want a co-sign and a whole track this year
If you know motherfuckers start acing weird
Lot of backstabbers and some actors here
Lot of has-beens and over-reactors here
I remember laughing and cracking beers
Now I climbed the ladder and you're mad I'm here

Motherfucker you ain't my accountant

(400)
Motherfucker, I'm gone

Judging me off of my past, you don't see what I'm doing
When I got shot that was headline news
You used me for views, I ain't stupid
Cause what about all the good? 
The non-profit for the kids in the hood
That ain't got no option in them shelter homes plottin' shit
I'm just doing what I should
They must want no one to know
Cause they don't put that on the news bro
They entertained by the culture, they vultures
They suck us like leaches 'til we broke
But I know the game so I play it like chess
Act like a square but really be the threat
The next time my name in the press
Talk about how yg gave them kids christmas

Motherfucker you ain't my accountant
You don't know what I'm doing
Focused on what I'm giving back make good music

Got the boombox and a blunt, bootlegger deuce-deuce
H on my crew, we get drunk, a little coo-coo
Type of dudes who square up and knock a tooth loose
Quick to the basement, the, the, the basement
That is the window I’m planning to vacate with
Pops put on bars just in case somebody breaks in
That’s not gonna stop me from getting to the pavement
Shh, meeting Jerome at the bus stop
I got the bigger roll, paranoid buck cops
And all my city’s known for grunge, flannel, puck rock

I got game, don’t need to talk anymore
Boppity-bo, tippity-toppity, I pop me some more
I was underground where he came from and he pop out a hole
Cracked the top back on the flat black aerosol
I woke up in the morning and I had a vision
These suit and ties got the nerve to call it vandalism
They hella mad, say my art is really bad for business
But I'mma paint a better world until the cans are empty
Now let it drip, let it drip
If they catch me doing dirt I’ll plead the fifth

Sometimes I don't know who I am
Sometimes I question why I'm here
I just wanna be a good dad
Will I be I have no idea
They say girls shouldn't be tough
And moms should raise their kids at home
But baby, I know that that isn't true
'Cause your momma's the toughest person I know
I wanna raise you to be like her
And watch you show the world how to do it on your own
I'm still tryna figure out who I am
I don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
I'm gonna be there for your first breath
I don't know if I'll be there for your first step
I can promise you that I'll try to work less
But the tour's routed, and I got this album
Put in so many hours, and I just want the outcome
To be something that I can look back and I can be proud of
Don't wanna be a dad that's living in FaceTime
But I've got a world to sing to and you at the same time
I won't spoil you, you can trust that
For your sweet sixteen, you get a bus pass
Had your heart broken, been there, done that
I love you and I can't give you enough of that

Read Langston Hughes, I suggest A Raisin in the Sun
Listen to Sam Cooke, a change gon' come
You put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love

And do it every day
Do that for the rest of your life
And eventually, the world will change

I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up

I recommend that you read The Alchemist
Listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
Tell the truth, regardless of the consequence
And every day, give your momma a compliment
Take your girl to the prom
But don't get too drunk hanging out the limo
Slow dance with your woman in your arms
Sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe
Don't wake your mom up,do yoga, learn 'bout karma
Find God, but leave the dogma
The quickest way to happiness learning to be selfless
Ask more questions, talk about yourself less
Study David Bowie, James Baldwin and 2Pac
Watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
Wear a helmet, don't be stupid,jaywalk, but look before you do it
If it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
Get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends, 'til it melts
Go to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
Take risks, 'cause life moves so fast
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance

Yeah
And we live tonight
Check it, now

I seen pain, I felt the losses
Attended funerals and seen coffins
21 years old, an angel was lost here
Wings clipped by the grip of 80 milligram sniffs of Oxycontin
Everyday through the nostrils
Never went away, never does it stop there
Death a line or two away and a couple tall cans
'Cause you never know when God is gonna call, man
Precious, what we all share
I said peace at five thirt, the next time that I saw him was in the hands of the pallbearer
What if I would've never gone and dropped him off there?
Blaming myself, in hysterics, screaming ""It's not fair!""
21 years old with a book of rhymes he was gonna recite to the globe
Only thing to numb the pain besides that shit in his nose
He was gonna quit tomorrow, we're all gonna quit tomorrow
Just get us through the weekend, and then Monday follows
Then it's Wednesday, then it's fuck it, I'm already feeling hollow
Might as well go crack a seal and might as well go chug a bottle
Might as well go pop a pill and go and band-aid that problem
And escape this world, vacate this world
'Cause I hate myself
No praying's gonna cure this pain

Doctor, please, give me a dose of the American Dream
Put down the pen and look in my eyes
We're in the waiting room and something ain't right
All this is on you, we're over prescribed

For me and Kev
You end up in jail, institutions are dead
And with our lives, we play Russian Roulette
And try to find a life where we could be content
'Cause for us, we're just trying to minimize the fear of being alive
And now my little brother is in the sky
From a pill that a doctor prescribed
That a drug deal a million dollar industry supplied
And the cops never go and profile at night
Yeah, the, the, the orange plastic with the white top they sell to you
Has us looking for the answers and not instead of you
Quick fix, whatever do
We just gonna neglect the truth
Because a doctor with a license played God and said it's cool
Played God and said it's cool
But me? I don't blame Kev or his mom freebasing while pregnant with him
I blame the pharmacy companies
And country that spends trillions fighting the war they supplying themselves
Politicians and business and jail
Public defenders and judges who fail
Look at Kevin, look at Kevin
Now he's wrapped in plastic
First dealer was his mom's medicine cabinet
Got anxiety, better go and give him a Xanax
Focus, give him Adderall, sleep, give him Ambien
'Til he's walking 'round the city looking like a mannequin
Ups and downs, shooting up prescriptions you're handing him
So America, is it really worth it? I'm asking you

Everybody got a resolution
But the next day, we forget about it never do 'em
I went to the gym and got a membership
Five minutes on the treadmill and I never lift
That was four years ago I should probably cancel this
But they tell me I gotta do it in person, ain't that a bitch?
But tomorrow though, I'mma get fit
Get me a fuel band and a fit-bit
Get me some workout shoes, and a bench press
Some lulu lemons and a french press
I'mma finally focus do some private yoga
Exercise my shoulders, I'mma hide the donuts
Realign my posture, no time for sofas
I'm finally sober no lime Coronas
But again, that's tomorrow
And today man I gotta go big cause it's my last day
Before I lose that weight, I gotta get one last plate and go big
I ate all night, Kool-Aid on ice
I woke up and I felt like shit
And I said, ""you know what, man fuck it
I should probably start on Monday instead""

In the back of a town car, staring at myself in a tux
Maneuvering through the people out front
Police barricade, orange cones and we're stuck
Twenty minutes late and my manager blowing me up
Security guard in the garage at the entrance
Rolled down the window and showed him our credentials
[?] flash the pass and he let's us continue
Metal detectors, phone booths and reception
I should be grateful this my nine to five
I walk into the green room, alright, alright
I get on Youtube tryna learn how to tie on my tie
Fuck it, I'll wear the bolo tonight, night, night
I probably shouldn't have done the drugs I've done
A couple of days ago, detox son
I forgot my belt at the hotel
Fuck, now my team all scared my [?] sucks
I need something to cope, ain't nothing to cope
I eat a banana and I drink a cup of throat coat
I wish I had the homies with me here but nope
Most of the artists that I know don't get invited to this show
Because success to them determines our value
The make-up, the power, the hairspray, perfume, make-up and powder
The ratings come down to who's popular now in the song in the hour
Knock at the door, I let them in, hair and make up now, red carpet in ten
She covers up my freckles, concealer on my chin
I look orange but she swears it looks natural with my skin
The show is starting, they take me to my seat
Walk in the arena building, ego of elites
Like the whole industry is staring at me
A row away from Taylor, two away from Jay and B

Just excited I got invited, feeling cool in the crowd
Thinking such and such is bold, look at such and such's gold
Damn, such and such in real life, looks really fuckin' old
Such and such is fine, she's with such and such, oh
I'm here but I'm barely even watching the show
Cause tonight we toast to our accomplishments
Insecurity dressed up as confidence
I said tonight we toast to our accomplishments
Insecurity dressed up as confidence
An award is given out, commercial, re-set the scene
They keep saying ""coming soon is the Biebs""
Watch celebrities take selfies with celebrities
It feels so make believe
They want the gossip, they want the drama
They want Britney Spears to make out with Madonna
They want Kanye to rant and to go on longer, cause that equates to more dollars
They want talking topics, they want trending topics
They want outfits to be outlandish, they want sideways glances
Beef and problems, they want nipple slips
Cause they live for clips, this is economics
So we Botox our skin and we smile for the camera
Might as well get a new nose while we're at it
This is America and insecurity's our fabric
And we wear it and we renamed it fashion
I look to my right, there's a cameraman snapping
Picture after picture after sister after sister
Of the line of Kardashians, mind so distracted
Realized there's an ovation and everyone's clapping

Last night the sky's turned purple and
Past lives in light tunnels
Light tunnels
So that's who we are
Just like the stars
Shine your light on
Shine your light on

It's just weird when the camera's on you
Gotta remember to still clap if I lose
I see myself on the screen
Split into five different artists on TV
And just look normal, don't get turned into a meme
Relax, breathe
Me
There's a stranger holding my award
I give her an awkward hug she says ""It's yours""
Think I'm supposed to kiss her on the cheek
Man, I should have prepared an acceptance speech
Do I talk first? Is it Ryan? Is it me?
Fuck it, I'll take the lead, grab the mic, say my piece
Do I look at camera one? Do I look at camera three?
I promise, I'm honored, I'd like to thank God, my momma and father
I'd like to thank Trisha, the mother of my daughter
I couldn't have done it without you all in my corner
Especially the fans, been here since the beginning
Supported the music, allowed us to be independent
And I know, I shouldn't be long winded
Wait hold up, don't play the music let me finish
This feels so narcissistic
Dressed as a celebration to conceal it's a business
Me, me, me, my my image
My, my songs, my self interest
One big reality show that is scripted
And I could keep trying or get out the competition
I rather run out of my fifteen minutes than have life
Pass me by and I forget to live it
But, that doesn't mean retirement
But I don't like who I am in this environment
I forgot what this art is for
I didn't get through freshman year to get out as a sophomore
Here I am in this arena, yeah I'm scared
I got the people's attention don't want to lose it here
Thinking about my career, miserable here
But wanna make sure I'm invited next year
To the same damn party, celebrities on isle
Same blank stares, same fake smiles
Same big budget production
I know now who I am when the lights go out and it falls down
And the curtain closes, nobody notices
Wanted to throw up the Roc, wanted to be Hova
Wanted to be Wayne with the accent from the NOLA
Thought I'd feel better when the award show was over
But I guess I showed up late
Almost got cut off when they closed the gate
Just in time, what will I say?
Time to explain this unruly mess I've made

I'm really good at telling the half truth but usually only when I have to
The money doesn't work, the chain doesn't work
Something broken in my brain, got me praying in the dirt
Got me stranded in my bed like I'm laying in the hearse
And the grass is always greener when you play on astroturf
Wonder why my generation poppin' pills and poppin' percs
And got some weed and got some purp
And got some bars and got some syurp
And got some Jordan's on my feet, I went and matched them with my shirt
And I just Instagrammed them both to show you that I got them first
Got a Louis duffel bag, I got my girl a purse
I'm tryna find God through a purchase, I'm not tryna go to church
Amen, Satan, told me not to serve

I only think about my come-up, capitalism

I met the devil in Manhattan, quickly ended discussion
I don't need a thing, he warned of repercussions
But I know he come in all forms, that won't be his last visit
Time is moving fast and I'm running where the past is
Looking in the mirror like, ""Damn that ain't my dad, is it?""
He handed a choice but he ain't hold my hand in it
I spent a pretty penny on microphones, many midis
In years and cds, I put the indy in Windy City
Indian giver, Black father, White liar
Right next to Eazy like Mike Myers
Stare at the cue cards, take out the juke parts
Take out the God references, just leave the cool parts
I remember opening for Ben, wasn't no liquor at the show
And now the white girls call me nigga at my show
I wish that I could open twice, sit down at the open mic

I used to steal my Daddy's cabernet
Never thought it would turn into a rattlesnake
Thinkin', everything will be all right
If we could get thru the week
Maybe see another Saturday
All the while where we know where to go
Argue with the homies over who's gonna roll
Bumpin' Goodie Mob as some food for the soul
Till it's two in the morning
When rain hits the windshield
And everything is still
Nothing really is a big deal?

St. Ides in that motherfucker

And I lose perspective
Need to go to a place where I lose reception
Looking at the satellites pass by
Reflectin' on my past life
I can barely remember last night
Another  morning, swear its the last time
Where would I be?
Can't start over if you don't get a new ID
I know the devil fancy me
But that don't mean that motherfucker gets to dance with me

I bought a house, second guessing what I own now (What?)
Traffic moving kinda slow now (What?)
I watch the population grow wild (What?)
A bunch of people I don't know now (What?)
My city's changed and I'm zoned out
I thought about New York, maybe SoCal
Put up condos people can't afford now
Marks bulldozed been tore down
Overpopulated but the city is a ghost town
Keep a little real ones with me
When it goes down
Lack of diversity, I think about Sloane now
Only reason I would ever leave my hometown
If I still drink, I would crack a 40 ounce

I wanted to talk just me and him
Because I had some things I felt I had to tell him

It's almost impossible to stay connected

Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"Pulled into the parking lot, parked it
Zipped up my parka, joined the procession of marchers
In my head like, ""is this awkward?
Should I even be here marching?""
Thinking if they can't, how can I breathe?
Thinking that they chant, what do I sing?
I want to take a stance 'cause we are not free
And then I thought about it, we are not ""we""
Am I in the outside looking in, or am I in the inside looking out?
Is it my place to give my two cents?
Or should I stand on the side and shut my mouth?
""No justice, no peace,"" okay, I'm saying that
They're chanting out, ""black lives matter,"" but I don't say it back
Is it okay for me to say? I don't know, so I watch and stand
In front of a line of police that look the same as me
Only separated by a badge, a baton, a can of Mace, a mask
A shield, a gun with gloves and hands that gives an alibi
In case somebody dies behind a bullet that flies out of the nine
Takes another child's life on sight

Blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
There's blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
Blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
There's blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free

You've exploited and stolen the music, the moment
The magic, the passion, the fashion, you toy with
The culture was never yours to make better
You're Miley, you're Elvis, you're Iggy Azalea
Fake and so plastic, you've heisted the magic
You've taken the drums and the accent you rapped in
Your brand of hip-hop, it's so fascist and backwards
That Grandmaster Flash'd go slap it, you bastard
All the money that you made
All the watered down pop-bullshit version of the culture, pal
Go buy a big-ass lawn, go with your big-ass house
Get a big-ass fence, keep people out
It's all stolen, anyway, can't you see that now?
There's no way for you to even that out
You can join the march, protest, scream and shout
Get on Twitter, hashtag and seem like you're down
But they see through it all, people believe you now?
You said publicly, ""rest in peace, Mike Brown""
You speak about equality, but do you really mean it?
Are you marching for freedom, or when it's convenient?
Want people to like you, want to be accepted?
That's probably why you are out here protesting
Don't think for a second you don't have incentive
Is this about you, well, then what's your intention?
What's the intention?
What's the intention?

""Pssst, I totally get it
You're by yourself and the last thing you want to do is take a picture
But seriously, my little girl loves you
She's always singing, 'I'm gonna pop some tags'
I'm not kidding, my oldest, you even got him to go thrifting
And 'One Love,' oh my God, that song, brilliant
Their aunt is gay, when that song came out
My son told his whole class he was actually proud
That's so cool, look what you're accomplishing
Even the old mom like me likes it, 'cause it's positive
You're the only hip-hop that I let my kids listen to
'Cause you get it, all that negative stuff it isn't cool""
(Yeah?) ""yeah, like, all the guns and the drugs
The bitches and the hoes and the gangs and the thugs
Even the protest outside, so sad, and so dumb
If a cop pulls you over, it's your fault if you run""
(Huh?)

Damn, a lot of opinions, a lot of confusion, a lot of resentment
Some of us scared, some of us defensive
And most of us aren't even paying attention
It seems like we're more concerned with being called racist
Than we actually are with racism
I've heard that silences are action and God knows that I've been passive
What if I actually read a article, actually had a dialogue
Actually looked at myself, actually got involved?
If I'm aware of my privilege and do nothing at all, I don't know
Hip-hop has always been political, yes
It's the reason why this music connects
So what the fuck has happened to my voice if I stay silent when black people are dying
Then I'm trying to be politically correct?
I can book a whole tour, sell out the tickets
Rap entrepreneur, built his own business
If I'm only in this for my own self-interest, not the culture that gave me a voice to begin with
Then this isn't authentic, it is just a gimmick
The D.I.Y underdog, so independent
But the one thing the American dream fails to mention
Is I was many steps ahead to begin with
My skin matches the hero, likeness, the image
America feels safe with my music in their systems
And it's suited me perfect, the role, I've fulfilled it
And if I'm the hero, you know who gets cast as the villain
White supremacy isn't just a white dude in Idaho
White supremacy protects the privilege I hold
White supremacy is the soil, the foundation, the cement and the flag that flies outside of my home
White supremacy is our country's lineage, designed for us to be indifferent
My success is the product of the same system that let off Darren Wilson, guilty
We want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by
We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives?
We want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by
We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives?

Your silence is a luxury
Hip-hop is not a luxury
Your silence is a luxury
Hip-hop is not a luxury
Your silence is a luxury
Hip-hop is not a luxury
Your silence is a luxury
Hip-hop is not a luxury
What I got for me, it is for me
What we made, we made to set us free

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,

Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

I am the voice

Midnight shimmering
Why can't you just open your mind
I'm tired of listening to the screams
Which comes from inside
Try to sleep now in solitude you shall awake
Sleep as a child all I feel is he's shattering gaze
Come with me I'll protect you from the voices within
I can't I wish I was close to you I can't bear this pain

Adrian please wake me...

Screams are shattering your vains
Promises only pain shall remain
Why do you struggle your fear
My gaze shall shatter your stear
Why do you petty yourself
Why can't you reach out instead
Why won't you trust me I am your voice you shall see...

There's no sleep tonight
Flashing memories fills my mind
I fell so close to you
Can't you stay with me until eternity

Screams shall forever reach your mind
Why, cause only one day you shall be mine
Creation of souls I make them blind
Eternal, soon they shall all be mine...

And forever I would stay
Took everything he had
And ran away
He reminded me
But I guess it's been a while
'Cause it's rather hazy to me now
Rather hazy to me now

Said that I'd be true
And love him till the end
Then he caught me
Messin' with his friend
He reminded me
But I guess it's been a while
'Cause it's rather hazy to me now
Rather hazy to me now

Thought my sins were washed away
Rack my brain on why you stayed
So easy to be good to him
But I don't think I've ever been

Maybe shady
Maybe cowardly
I turned and gave him
No apologies
Said, I'll see you around

What a misery it turned out to be
Sorry for the time I doubted you

Disappear your low low lows and your woe woe woes
Just like that, it's nature fact
I can't wait'til he gets back

When will they go from here
When will they stop
I believe that fate has brought us here
And we should be together babe
But we're not
I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you
And I'll keep my cool, but I'm fiendin'

I try to say goodbye and I choke
Try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not here
Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not here

I may appear to be free
But I'm just a prisoner of your love
And I may seem all right and smile when you leave
But my smiles are just a front
Just a front, hey
I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you
And I'll try to keep my cool, but I'm fiendin'

I try to say goodbye and I choke
Try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not here
Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not here

Here is my confession
May I be your possession
Boy, I need your touch
Your love, kisses and such
With all my might I try
But this I can't deny
Deny

I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you

Macy Gray,"My baby works down at the boulevard café
Just a fine young man with big dreams
Trying to make his own way
The owner is this man ole bitch who degrades
Him everyday
Then she fires him for no reason
Don't wanna give him for no reason
I've committed murder and I think I got away
I'm hiding at my mother's house come get me right away
Right away
I have no intention of paying for my crimes don't fear
We're gonna get the next plane outta here and fly away
Fly away

When he's down it breaks my heart to see him
So I figured I'd talk to her woman to woman
I walk in and she's countin her cash
Got so much cash her office looks like a green pasture
I said, ""Give him the little bit of money you owe him""
She said ""Get back bitch I ain't givin you shit""
I said, ""You ole bag, maybe you ain't heard but them are fightin words""
I've committed murder and I think I got away

And I don't feel bad about it
But the good thing is
And I don't feel bad about it
We don't have to struggle no more

With a suitcase full of money
We flew to a Jamaican paradise
One thing I've learned through all of this is
Having money sure is nice

Me and my baby got married
He's working hard to make his dreams came true
As far as regrets I don't have any
Would you?

Macy Gray,"All I ever wanted was some love and peace and harmony 
I could dance in the raw in the sun underneath the stars 
When I walk over to my money tree ain't nobody there 
Trying to take from me 
When they ask ""Are you truly free?"" I'd say ""Yes, truly"" 
But down here in reality everybody knows there ain't 
No such thing 
And It's clear 
It's obviously this is not the place I'm supposed to be 
On and on and on I've searched 
What I'm looking for is not here on earth 
I can't stand I can't take no more 
So I know that I gotta go 
So long everybody 
Mama don't be sad for me 
Life was a heartache and now I am finally free 
Don't know where I'm headed 
Hope I see you someday soon 
So long everybody 
I have gone beyond the moon 

All I ever wanted was some love and peace and harmony 
Just to be live and shine 
When I get ready I up and fly 
And I can't remember none of the things that I want 
To forget 
It's the best - satisfaction no less 
Ask if I'm free and I'll say ""Oh yes""

In my dawn a new day
I finally got away
But my head's all messed up and he knows just what to say
No more dawn and new days
I'm goin back to stay
So why say bye bye
When it only makes me cry
I still
Light up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up
I still
Melt down like a candle burnin' every time we touch
Oh say what you will
He does me wrong and I should be gone
But I still
Be lovin' you baby and it's much too much

We are goin down
'Cause you're always getting high
And your crumbs of lovin'
No longer get me by
Wow! It get better every time that we get high
Then your crumbs of lovin'
They somehow get me by
Why, say bye bye
When it only makes me cry

Light up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up

Melt down like a candle burnin' every time we touch

Light up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up

I be lovin' you baby and it's much too much

Can't I go my severed way?
Some rain for my sunny day
Not even one reason to stay
Why?
I should've left you
Why?
I can't forgetcha baby
Why?
Ever since I metcha it's
Why?

Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal 
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan

Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito 
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza 
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
