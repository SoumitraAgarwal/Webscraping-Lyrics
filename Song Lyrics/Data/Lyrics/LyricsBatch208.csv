Andrew Jackman,"I have never felt like this
For once I'm lost for words
Your smile has really thrown me
This is not like me at all
I never thought I'd know
The kind of love you've shown me

Now, no matter where I am
No matter what I do
I see your face appearing
Like an unexpected song
An unexpected song
That only we are hearing

I don't know what is going on
Can't work it out at all
Whatever made you choose me
I just can't believe my eyes
You look at me as though
You couldn't bear to lose me

Now, no matter where I am
No matter what I do
I see your face appearing
Like an unexpected song
An unexpected song
That only we are hearing

I have never felt like this
For once I'm lost for words
Your smile has really thrown me
This is not like me at all
I never thought I'd know
The kind of love you've shown me

Now, no matter where I am
No matter what I do
I see your face appearing
Like an unexpected song
An unexpected song
That only we are hearing

Like an unexpected song
An unexpected song
That only we are hearing",Unexpected Song [From 'Song & Dance']
Andrew Jackman,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true",When You Wish Upon a Star [From 'Pinocchio']
Andrew Jackman,"When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
Is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Tho' your dreams be tossed and blown
Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone",You'll Never Walk Alone [From 'Carousel']
Andrew Jackson,"(*talking*)
We got that green stuff, Big Tite
Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in y'all face

[Slim Thug]
I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue that
22 that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

[Hook - 2x]
Too much money, too much cash
All y'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All y'all haters, can kiss our ass

[Lil Flip]
Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging 4's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And y'all haters, y'all can kiss our ass

[Hook - 2x]

[Tite]
I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

[Hook - 2x]

Andrew Johnston,"I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream

I have a dream, a fantasy
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness still another mile
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream

I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream",I Have A Dream
Andrew Johnston,"Just one voice singing in the darkness
All it takes is one voice
Singing so they hear what's on your mind
And when you look around you'll find
There's more than one voice singing in the darkness
Joining with that one voice
Each and every note another octave
Hands are joined and fears unlocked

If only one voice would start it on it's own
We need just one voice facing the unknown
And then that one voice would never be alone
It takes that one voice
Ba ba ba da da da da
It takes that one voice

Just one voice singing in the darkness
All it takes is one voice
Shout it out and let it ring
Just one voice
It takes that one voice
And every one will sing",One Voice
Andrew Johnston,"Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Will it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven

Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven

Time can bring you down
Time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart
Have you begging please, begging please

If I saw you
Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Will it be the same if I, if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven
Heaven, heaven, no, no, no, here in heaven",Tears in Heaven
Andrew Kenny,"Staring out the glass of your tired sedan
Waiting at your door, leaning up against the jamb
Going all the way
make you sing my guitar
It's late and I can't stay
The secrets of the heart
On the study floor with the words in your hands
You pull the hairpin out, now 
And down pour the strands
But you were a mistake
You can sing to my guitar
It's late and I can't stay
The secrets of the heart",Secrets of the Heart
Andrew Krasilnikov,"From moment to moment every moment that I live
I live for every moment with you
To see you, to touch you, to imagine this will be
The moment when a dream comes true

Just an ordinary day becomes adventure
Such sweet adventure I never knew
And life will be rainbows as I learn the secret of
The miracle that love can do
From moment to moment with you

And life will be rainbows as I learn the secret of
The miracle that love can do
From moment to moment with you",Moment to Moment
Andrew L. Goodrich,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"(Judas)
There he is
They're all asleep, the fools

(Jesus)
Judas, must you betray me 
With a kiss?

(Peter and Apostles)
What's the buzz
Tell me what's happening
Hang on Lord
We're gonna fight for you

(Jesus)
Put away your sword
Don't you know that it's all over
It was nice but now it's gone
Why are you obsessed with fighting?
Stick to fishing from now on

(Crowd)
Tell me Christ how you feel tonight
Do you plan to put up a fight?
Do you feel that you've had the breaks?
What would you say were your big mistakes?
Do you think that you may retire?
Did you think you would get much higher?
How do you view your coming trial?
Have your men proved all worthwhile?

Come with us to see Caiaphas
You'll just love the high priest's house
You'll just love seeing Caiaphas
You'll just die in the high priest's house

Come on God this is not like you
Let us know what you're gonna do
You know what your supporters feel
You'll escape in the final reel

Tell me Christ how you feel tonight
Do you plan to put up a fight?
Do you feel that you've had the breaks?
What would you say were your big mistakes?

Come with us to see Caiaphas
You just love the high priest's house
You just love seeing Caiaphas
You'll just die in the high priest's house

Now we have him, now we got him
Now we have him, now we got him

Father forgive them.
They don't know what they're doing.
My God, my God, why have you forgotten me?
Father, into your hands, I commend my spirit.",The Crucifixion
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"JUDAS

My God! I saw him.
He looked three-quarters dead!
And he was so bad I had to turn my head.
You beat him so hard that he was bent and lame,
And I know who everybody's going to blame.
I don't believe he knows I acted for our good.
I'd save him all this suffering if I could.
Don't believe...our good...
And I'd save him if I could...

ANNAS

Cut the confessions, forget the excuses.
I don't understand why you're filled with remorse.
All that you've said has come true with a vengeance.
The mob turned against him, you backed the right horse.

CAIAPHAS

What you have done will be the saving of everyone.
You'll be remembered forever for this.
And not only that, you've been paid for your efforts.
Pretty good wages for one little kiss.

JUDAS

Christ, I know you can't hear me,
But I only did what you wanted me too.
Christ, I'd sell out the nation,
For I have been saddled with the murder of you.
I have been spattered with innocent blood.
I shall be dragged through the slime and the mud.
I have been spattered with innocent blood.
I shall be dragged through the slime and the mud!
I don't know how to love him.
I don't know why he moves me.
He's a man. He's just a man.
He is not a king. He is just the same
As anyone I know.
He scares me so!
When he's cold and dead will he let me be?
Does he love me too? Does he care for me?
My mind is in darkness.
God, God I'm sick. I've been used,
And you knew all the time.
God, God I'll never ever know why you chose me for your crime.
You're so bloody, Christ.

CHOIR

Poor old Judas. So long Judas.

JUDAS

You have murdered me.",Judas's Death
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Jesus, I am overjoyed to meet you face to face.
You've been getting quite a name all around the place.
Healing cripples, raising from the dead.
And now I understand you're God,
At least, that's what you've said.
So, you are the Christ, you're the great Jesus Christ.
Prove to me that you're divine; change my water into wine.
That's all you need do, then I'll know it's all true.
Come on, King of the Jews.
Jesus, you just won't believe the hit you've made around here.
You are all we talk about, the wonder of the year.
Oh what a pity if it's all a lie.
Still, I'm sure that you can rock the cynics if you tried.
So, you are the Christ, you're the great Jesus Christ.
Prove to me that you're no fool; walk across my swimming pool.
If you do that for me, then I'll let you go free.
Come on, King of the Jews.
I only ask what I'd ask any superstar.
What is it that you have got that puts you where you are.
I am waiting, yes I'm a captive fan.
I'm dying to be shown that you are not just any man.
So, if you are the Christ, yes the great Jesus Christ
Feed my household with this bread.
You can do it on your head.
Or has something gone wrong. Jesus, why do you take so long?
Oh come on, King of the Jews.
Hey! Aren't you scared of me Christ?
Mr. Wonderful Christ?
You're a joke. You're not the Lord.
You are nothing but a fraud.
Take him away.
He's got nothing to say!

Look at all my trials and tribulations
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine.
Don't disturb me now, I can see the answers

Knew that I would make it if I tried.

So they'll still talk about us when we've died.

JESUS

The end...is just a little harder, when brought about by friends.
For all you care, this wine could be my blood.
For all you care, this bread could be my body.
The end! This is my blood you drink.
This is my body you eat.
If you would remember me when you eat and drink.
I must be mad thinking I'll be remembered.
Yes, I must be out of my head.
Look at your blank faces. My name will mean nothing

One of you denies me.
One of you betrays me.

What if I just stayed here

Save me your speeches,
I don't want to know. Go!

You sad, pathetic man, see where you've brought us to,
Our ideals die around us and all because of you.
But the saddest cut of all:
Someone has to turn you in.
Like a common criminal, like a wounded animal.

We need him crucified,

Talk to me, Jesus Christ.
Look at your Jesus Christ.
I'll agree he's mad.
Ought to be locked up,
But that is not a reason to destroy him.
He's a sad little man.
Not a King or God.
Not a thief,
I need a crime!

Crucify him!

Behold a man,
Behold your shattered King.

We have no King but Caesar.

You hypocrites,
You hate us more than him.

We have no King but Caesar,
Crucify him!

I see no reason. I find no evil.
This man is harmless, so why does he upset you?
He's just misguided, thinks he's important,
But to keep you vultures happy I shall flog him.

Crucify him! Crucify him!

(Thirty-nine lashes, Pilate counts)

Where are you from Jesus?
What do you want Jesus?
Tell me.
You've got to be careful.
You could be dead soon,
Could well be.
Why do you not speak when
I hold your life in my hands?
How can you stay quiet?
I don't believe you understand.

You have nothing in your hands.
Any power you have, comes to you from far beyond.
Everything is fixed, and you can't change it.

You're a fool Jesus Christ.
How can I help you?

Pilate, Crucify him!
Remember Caesar.
You have a duty
To keep the peace, so crucify him!
Remember Caesar.
You'll be demoted.
You'll be deported. Crucify him!

Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now

Brothers
But what makes us mad
Are the things that Joseph tells us of the
Dream's he often had

I dreamed that in the fields one day,
The corn gave me sign
Your eleven sheaves of corn
All turned and bowed to mine
My sheaf was was quite a sight to see
A golden sheaf and tall
Yours were green and second-rate
And really rather small

This is not the kind of thing
We brothers like to hear
It seems to us that Joseph and his
Dreams should disappear

I dreamed I saw eleven stars,
The sun the moon and sky
Bowing down before my star,
It made me wonder why
Could it be that I was born
For higher thing than you?
A post in someone's government,
A ministry or two

The dreams of our dear brother are
The decade's biggest yawn
His talk of stars and golden sheaves
Is just a load of corn
Not only is he tactless but
He's also rather dim
For there's eleven of us and
There's only one of him
The dreams of course will not come true
That is, we think they won't come true
That is, we hope they won't come true
What if he's right all along?

The dreams are more than crystal clear,
The writing on the wall
Means that Joseph some day soon
Will rise above us all

Has to go",Joseph's Dreams [From Joseph & the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]

I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every streetlamp seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters, and a streetlamp gutters,
And soon it will be morning.

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
And I mustn't give in.
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me!
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day
Has begun",Memory [From Cats]

Oh! well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

He is quiet he is small he is black,
From his ears to the tip of his tail.
He can creep through the tiniest crack, 
He can walk on the narrowest rail.

He can pick any card from a pack,
He is equally cunning with dice.
He is always deceiving you into believing that he's only hunting for mice.
He can play any trick with a cork,

Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste.
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it is merely misplaced;
You have seen it one moment and then it is gone,
But you find it next week lying out on the lawn.

[Chorus: x2]
And we all say: Oh! 
Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

My manner is vague and aloof,
You would think there is nobody shyer,
But my voice has been heard on the roof
When I was curled up by the fire,

And I've sometimes been heard by the fire;
When I was around on the roof
(At least they all heard that somebody purred)
Which is incontestable proof

Of my singular magical powers,
And I've known the family to call
Me in the garden for hours
While I was asleep in the hall.

And not long ago this phenomenal cat
Produced seven kittens right out of a hat!

[Chorus]

And not long ago this phenomenal cat,
Produced seven kittens right out of a hat!

Night time sharpens
Heightens each sensation...
Darkness wakes
And stirs imagination
Silently the senses 
Abandon their defences
Helpless to resist 
The notes I write
For I compose 
The music of the night...

Slowly, gently
Night unfurls its splendour.
Grasp it, sense it -
Tremulous and tender
Hearing is believing
Music is deceiving
Hard as lightning
Soft as candlelight
Dare you trust
The music of the night...

Close your eyes
For your eyes will only tell the truth
And the truth
Isn't what you want to see.
In the dark
It is easy to pretend
That the truth
Is what it ought to be.

Softly, deftly
Music shall caress you...
Hear it, feel it
Secretly possess you...

Open up your mind
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which
You know you cannot fight - 
The darkness of 
The music of the night...

Close your eyes
Start a journey through a
Strange new world!
Leave all thoughts
Of the world 
You knew before!

Close your eyes
And let music set you free...
Only then 
Can you belong to me...

Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication!
Touch me, trust me
Savour each sensation...

Let the dream
Begin
Let your darker side
Give in
To the power of
The music that I write - 
The power of
The music of the night...

You alone
Can make my song take flight -
Help me make
The music of the night...

Come we must return - 
Those two fools
Who run my theatre
Will be missing you...",Music of the Night [From Phantom of the Opera]
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Oh what a circus, oh what a show
Argentina has gone to town
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron
We've all gone crazy
Mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right

Oh what an exit, that's how to go
When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron
It's quite a sunset
And good for the country in a roundabout way
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today

But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?

She had her moments, she had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the casa rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""
But that's all gone now
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

Salve regina mater misericordiae
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
Salve salve regina
Ad te clamamus exules filii eva
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes
O clemens o pia
Hail, oh queen, mother of mercy
Our life, sweetness, and hope
Hail, hail, oh queen
To you we cry, exiled sons of eve
To you we sigh, mourning and weeping
Oh clement, oh loving one

You let down your people Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for
But in the end you could not deliver

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
And she's not coming back to you

Show business kept us all alive
Since seventeen October 1945
But the star has gone, the glamor's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in

Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much, but she said it loud

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
She's not coming back to you

Salve regina mater misericordiae
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
Salve salve regina peron
Ad te clamamus exules filii eva
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes
O clemens o pia

Don't cry for me Argentina
For I am ordinary, unimportant
And undeserving of such attention
Unless we all are, I think we all are
So share my glory, so share my coffin
So share my glory, so share my coffin

It's our funeral too",Oh! What a Circus [From Evita]
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Now Eva Peron had every disadvantage
You need if you're gonna succeed
No money, no cash
No father, no bright lights
There was nowhere she'd been
At the age of fifteen

As this tango singer found out
Agustin Magaldi
Who has the distinction of being the first
Man to be of use to Eva Duarte

[Magaldi:]
On this night of a thousand stars
Let me take you to heaven's door
Where the music of love's guitars
Plays for evermore

In the glow of those twinkling lights
We shall love through eternity
On this night in a million nights
Fly away with me

I never dreamed that a kiss could be as sweet as this
But now I know that it can
I used to wander alone without a love of my own
I was a desperate man
But all my grief disappeared and all the sorrow I'd feared
Wasn't there anymore
On that magical day when you first came my way
Mi amor

On this night
On this night
On this night of a thousand stars
Let me take you to heaven's door
Where the music of love's guitars

His final sacrifice
His body may be past its peak
But his soul's in paradise

At sixes and sevens with you

I kept my promise. Don't keep your distance

Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions, they're not the solutions they promised to be

Masquerade! Hide your face so the world will never find you
Masquerade! Every face a different shade
Masquerade! Look around, there's another mask behind you

Fool and king, ghoul and goose
Green and black, queen and priest
Trace of rouge, face of beast, faces

On the merry-go-round in an inhuman race
Eye of gold, true is false
Who is who?

Curl of lip, swirl of gown
Ace of hearts, face of clown, faces
Drink it in, drink it up till you've drowned
In the light, in the sound but who can name the face?

Masquerade! Grinning yellows, spinning reds
Masquerade! Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you
Masquerade! Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade! Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you

Masquerade! Seething shadows breathing lies
Masquerade! You can fool any friend who ever knew you
Masquerade! Leering satyrs, peering eyes
Masquerade! Run and hide, but a face will still pursue you

What a night! What a crowd!
Makes you glad
Makes you proud
All the crème, de la crème

All our fears are in the past

Of delight, of Elysian peace

And we can breathe at last
No more notes, no more ghost

To a prosperous year

To our friends who are here
And may the splendor never fade
What a blessed release
And what a masquerade

Look, your future bride, just think of it
But, why is it secret? What have we to hide?
You promised me, no, Raoul, please don't, they'll see
Well then let them see, it's an engagement, not a crime

She's been out doing what we just talked about, example
Gave us back our businesses, got the English out
And when you think about it, well why not do
One or two of the things we promised to?

But on the other hand, she's slowing down
She's lost a little of that magic drive
But I would not advise those critics present to derive
Any satisfaction from her fading star
She's the one who's kept us where we are

She's the one who's kept you where you are",She Is a Diamond [From Evita]

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"High flying, adored
So young, the instant queen
A rich beautiful thing, of all the talents
A cross between a fantasy of the bedroom and a saint
You were just a backstreet girl
Hustling and fighting, scratching and biting

High flying, adored
Did you believe in your wildest moments
All this would be yours
That you'd become the lady of them all?

Were there stars in your eyes
When you crawled in at night
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall

High flying, adored
What happens now, where do you go from here?
For someone on top of the world
The view is not exactly clear
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now
Nothing can thrill you, no one fulfill you

High flying, adored
I hope you come to terms with boredom
So famous so easily, so soon
It's not the wisest thing to be

You won't care if they love you
It's been done before
You'll despair if they hate you
You'll be drained of all energy
All the young who've made it would agree

High flying, adored
That's good to hear but unimportant
My story's quite usual

Filled a gap, I was lucky
But one thing I'll say for me
No one else can fill it like I can",High Flying Adored

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Remark the cat who hesitates toward you
In the light of the door which opens on her like a grin
You see the border of her coat is torn and stained with sand
And you see the corner of her eye twist like a crooked pin

She haunted many a low resort
Near the grimy road of Tottenham Court
She flitted about the No Man's Land
From ""The Rising Sun"" to ""The Friend at Hand""
And the postman sighed as he scratched his head
""You'd really had thought she ought to be dead""

Way way back many centuries ago, not long after the Bible began
Jacob lived in the land of Canaan, a fine example of a family man
Jacob, Jacob and sons, depended on farming to earn their keep
Jacob, Jacob and sons, spent all of their days in the fields with sheep

Jacob was the founder of a whole new nation,
Thanks to the number of children he'd had
He was also known as Israel but most of the time
His sons and his wives used to call him dad
Jacob, Jacob and sons, men of the soil, of the sheaf and crook
Jacob, Jacob and sons, a remarkable family in anyone's book

Reuben was the eldest of the children of Israel,
With Simeon and Levi the next in line
Napthali and Isaachar with Asher and Dan,
Zebulun and Gad took the total to nine

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Oh what a circus, oh what a show
Argentina has gone to town
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron
We've all gone crazy
Mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right

Oh what an exit, that's how to go
When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron
It's quite a sunset
And good for the country in a roundabout way
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today

But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?

She had her moments, she had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the casa rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""
But that's all gone now
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

Salve regina mater misericordiae
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
Salve salve regina
Ad te clamamus exules filii eva
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes

Hail, oh queen, mother of mercy
Our life, sweetness, and hope
Hail, hail, oh queen
To you we cry, exiled sons of eve
To you we sigh, mourning and weeping
Oh clement, oh loving one

You let down your people Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for
But in the end you could not deliver

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
And she's not coming back to you

Show business kept us all alive
Since seventeen October 1945
But the star has gone, the glamor's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in

Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much, but she said it loud

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
She's not coming back to you

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Well I was wandering along by the banks of the river when seven fat cows
came out of the Nile
And right behind them fine healthy animals came seven other cows,
skinny and vile
Well the thin cows ate the fat cows which I thought would do them good
But it didn't make them fatter like I thought a monster supper should
Because the thin ones were as thin as they had ever ever been
This dream has got me baffled, hey Joseph, tell me what it means

C'mon you know that kings ain't stupid
But I don't have a clue
So don't be cruel Joseph
You gotta help me now I beg of you

I was standing doing nothing in a field out of town I saw seven
beautiful ears of corn
They were ripe they were golden but you guessed it right
behind them were seven other ears  tattered and torn
Then the bad corn ate the good corn man they came up right behind
yes they did
And Joseph here's the punchline it's really gonna blow your mind 
flip your lid
Because the bad corn was as bad as it had ever ever been
This dream has got me all shook up, treat me nice and tell me what it means

Hey hey Joseph won't you tell me what this crazy dream really means",Song of the King (Seven Fat Cows)
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"[Che:]
Tell me before I waltz out of your life
Before turning my back on the past
Forgive my impertinent behavior
But how long do you think this pantomime can last?

Tell me before I ride off in the sunset
There's one thing I never got clear
How can you claim you're our savior
When those who oppose you are stepped on
Or cut up, or simply disappear?

[Eva:]
Tell me before you get onto your bus
Before joining the forgotten brigade
How can one person like me, say
Alter the time-honored way the game is played?

Tell me before you get onto your high horse
Just what you expect me to do
I don't care what the bourgeoisie say
I'm not in business for them
But to give all my descamisados
A magical moment or two

[Che and Eva:]
There is evil, ever around
Fundamental system of government
Quite incidental

[Eva:]
So what are my chances of honest advances?
I'd say low
Better to win by admitting my sin
Than to lose with a halo

[Che:]
Tell me before I seek worthier pastures
And thereby restore self-esteem
How can you be so short-sighted
To look never further than this week or next week
To have no impossible dream?

[Eva:]
Allow me to help you slink off to the sidelines
And mark your adieu with three cheers
But first tell me who'd be delighted
If I said I'd take on the world's greatest problems
From war to pollution, no hope of solution
Even if I lived for one hundred years

[Che and Eva:]
There is evil, ever around
Fundamental system of government
Quite incidental

[Eva:]
So go, if you're able, to somewhere unstable
And stay there
Whip up your hate in some tottering state
But not here, dear
Is that clear, dear?

Oh what I'd give for a hundred years
But the physical interferes
Every day more, oh my Creator
What is the good of the strongest heart
In a body that's falling apart?
A serious flaw, I hope you know that",Waltz for Eva and Che

No. Yes. Ho. Hi. Oh my eye!

I believe it is Old Deuteronomy

He's a cat who has lived many lives in succession
He was famous in proverb and famous in rhyme
A long while before Queen Victoria's accession
Old Deuteronomy's buried nine wives
And more I am tempted to say ninety-nine
And his numerous progeny prospers and thrives
And the village is proud of him in his decline
At the sight of that placid and bland physiognomy
When he sits in the sun on the vicarage wall
The oldest inhabitant croaks

Yes, oh yes.

So am I. What a fortunate coincidence.
Maybe you're my reward for my efforts here tonight.

It seems crazy, but you must believe

But you really should know, I'd be good for you
I'd be surprisingly good for you.
I won't go on if I'm boring you
but do you understand my point of view?
Do you like what you hear, what you see,
and would you be good for me, too?
I'm not talking of a hurried night
a frantic tumble, then a shy goodbye
creeping home before it gets too light

Next time you fall in love
It better be with me

And so you settle for whatever gets you through the night
The flame you thought was dead may suddenly begin to burn
And broken hearts can be repaired, that's something that you learn

Next time you fall in love
It better be with me

A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree 

High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man

Filled a gap--I was lucky

No-one else can fill it like I can",High Flying Adored [From Evita]

I know my way around here
The cardboard trees, the painted scenes, the sound here
Yes a world to rediscover,
But I'm not in any hurry
And I need a moment

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways,
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Why everything's as if we never said goodbye

I've spent so many mornings
Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now
You can't know how I've missed you,
Missed the fairy-tail adventures
In this ever-spinning playground
We were young together

I'm coming out of make-up
The lights already burning,
Not long until the camera's will start turning
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye

I don't want to be alone that's all in the past,
This world's waited long enough,
I've come home at last!

And this time will be bigger,
And brighter than we knew it
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment with so much to live for?

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways,
So much to say not just today but always

We'll have magic in the making

Yet, if he said he loved me
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened

I want him so

I love him so",I Don't Know How to Love Him (from Jesus Christ Superstar)
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Love, love changes everything 
Hands and faces, earth and sky 
Love, love changes everything 
How you live and how you die 
Love, can make the summer fly 
Or a night seem like a lifetime 
Yes love, love changes everything 
Now I tremble at your name 
Nothing in the world will ever be the same 

Love, love changes everything 
Days are longer, words mean more 
Love, love changes everything 
Pain is deeper than before 
Love will turn your world around 
And that world will last forever 
Yes love, love changes everything 
Brings you glory, brings you shame 
Nothing in the world will ever be the same 

Off into the world we go 
Planning futures, shaping years 
Love bursts in and suddenly all our wisdom disappears 
Love makes fools of everyone 
All the rules we made are broken 
Yes love, love changes everyone 
Live or perish in its flame 
Love will never never let you be the same 
Love will never never let you be the same",Love Changes Everything (from Aspects of Love)
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Night time, sharpens, heightens each sensation,
Darkness stirs, and wakes imagination,
Silently the senses, abandon their defenses,

Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender,
Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn you face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night",The Music of the Night (from Phantom of the Opera)
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"[Chorus:]
No matter what they tell us 
No matter what they do 
No matter what they teach us 
What we believe is true 

No matter what they call us 
However they attack 
No matter where they take us 
We'll find our own way back 

I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not 
I know I'll love forever 
I know  no matter what 

If only tears were laughter 
If only night was day 
If only prayers were answered 
Then we would hear God say 

[Chorus]

And I will keep you safe and strong 
And shelter from the storm 
No matter where it's barren 
A dream is being born 
No matter who they follow 
No matter where they lead 
No matter how they judge us 
I'll be everyone you need 
No matter if the sun don't shine 
Or if the skies are blue 
No matter what the end is 
My life began with you 

I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not 
I know, I know 
I know this love's forever 
That's all that matters now 
No matter what!",No Matter What (from Whistle Down the Wind)
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Oh what a circus, oh what a show
Argentina has gone to town
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron
We've all gone crazy
Mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right

Oh what an exit, that's how to go
When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron
It's quite a sunset
And good for the country in a roundabout way
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today

But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?

She had her moments, she had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the casa rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""
But that's all gone now
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

Salve regina mater misericordiae
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
Salve salve regina
Ad te clamamus exules filii eva
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes
O clemens o pia
Hail, oh queen, mother of mercy
Our life, sweetness, and hope
Hail, hail, oh queen
To you we cry, exiled sons of eve
To you we sigh, mourning and weeping
Oh clement, oh loving one

You let down your people Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for
But in the end you could not deliver

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
And she's not coming back to you

Show business kept us all alive
Since seventeen October 1945
But the star has gone, the glamor's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in

Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much, but she said it loud

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
She's not coming back to you

Don't cry for me Argentina
For I am ordinary, unimportant
And undeserving of such attention

So share my glory, so share my coffin

It's our funeral too",Oh What a Circus (from Evita)
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Ring out the old
Bring in the new
A midnight wish to share with you
Your lips are warm, my head is light
Were we in love before tonight?

I don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year

No need to hear the music play
Your eyes say all there is to say
The stars can fade
And they can shine
Long as your face is next to mine

I don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year

We don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year

It's New Year's Eve, and hopes are high
Dance one year in, kiss one goodbye
Another chance, another start
So many dreams to tease the heart

Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year",The Perfect Year (from Sunset Boulevard)

Every time I look at you I don't understand
Why you let the things you did get so out of hand.

Why'd you choose such a backward time in such a strange land?

At last all too well
I can see where we all soon will be.
If you strip away The myth from the man,
You will see where we all soon will be. Jesus!
You've started to believe
The things they say of you.
You really do believe
This talk of God is true.
And all the good you've done
Will soon get swept away.
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say.

Listen Jesus I don't like what I see.
All I ask is that you listen to me.
And remember, I've been your right hand man all along.
You have set them all on fire.
They think they've found the new Messiah.
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong.

I remember when this whole thing began.
No talk of God then, we called you a man.
And believe me, my admiration for you hasn't died.
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way.
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied.
Nazareth, your famous son should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood He'd have made good.
Tables, chairs, and oaken chests would have suited Jesus best.
He'd have caused nobody harm; no one alarm.

Listen, Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied; have you forgotten how put down we are?

I am frightened by the crowd.
For we are getting much too loud.
And they'll crush us if we go too far.
If they go too far....

Listen, Jesus, to the warning I give.
Please remember that I want us to live.
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour.
All your followers are blind.
Too much heaven on their minds.
It was beautiful, but now it's sour.
Yes it's all gone sour.

Aren't supporting a single ass
That would rise for the girl
She'll take a mile

Such a shame she wandered into our enclosure
How unfortunate this person has forced us to be blunt

Peron's latest flame
You said it brother

Should you wish to cause great distress
In the tidiest officer's mess

That isn't funny

Peron is a fool, breaking every taboo
Installing a girl in the army H.Q.

We are tired of the decline of Argentina
With no sign of a government able to give us the things we deserve

It's no crime for officers to do as they please
As long as they're discreet and keep clear of disease
We ignore, we disregard
But once they allow a bit on the side
To move to the center where she's not qualified
We are forced to mark his card

She should get into her head
She should not get out of bed
She should know that she's not paid

Tell us where you go from here, Miss Duarte

That's no help to the Argentine


Can we assume then that you'll quit?
Is this because of your involvement with Colonel Peron?

Goodnight and thank you

She won't be kept happy by her nights on the tiles
She says it's his body, but she's after his files
So get back on to the street

He's young, very young 
But a feeling...
I feel I know him
Seeing is believing

And I like what I see
I like where I am
What I'm feeling
What are we doing?

Can you believe it?
A starving actress and a starstruck boy
Oh well, I might as well enjoy
The moment

She's warm, and she's wild
And appealing
I feel I know her

Seeing is believing
I never thought I'd be here
Is this really real
Or am I dreaming?
No way of knowing
Where this is leading
It's fun forgetting who we are
Who cares when now the world is far behind us?

In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again?
For now I find
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my mind

Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The phantom of the opera is here
Inside your mind

Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear

My spirit and my voice
In one combined
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my mind

In all your fantasies you always knew
That man and mystery were both in you
And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The phantom of the opera is here
Inside my mind

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Half a moment 
We are together 
I shall want no-one else 
And nothing new. 
Half a moment 
I shall treasure, 
Keep it locked away 
For some future rainy day. 

Should you leave me 
With just this moment 
In my mind 
I shall capture it anew, 
Like some picture 
Taken in my childhood 
Half a moment 
Spent with you.

Taken in my childhood 
Half a moment 
Spent with you. 

Countless vivid memories 
Spin before my view, 
Like some toy kaleidoscope 
Images of you. 

Time looks kindly 
On fleeting lovers 
They can turn the briefest hour 
Into a day 
Turn a moment 
To a lifetime 
Making it to last 
Blending future with the past. 

We're together, 
What else can matter? 
Even though 
Half a moment is too few 
I shall save it

Making one whole moment 
Filled with you.",Half a moment

In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet

I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was

Someone mutters, and a streetlamp gutters,
And soon it will be morning.

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Every time I look at you I don't understand
Why you let the things you did get so out of hand.

Why'd you choose such a backward time in such a strange land?

Israel in 4 BC had no mass communication.

Buddha, was he where it's at? Is he where you are?
Could Mohammed move a mountain, or was that just PR?
Did you mean to die like that? Was that a mistake, or
Did you know your messy death would be a record breaker?

When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun

So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired

They are illusions
They are not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Don't cry for me Argentina

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

There's nothing more I can think of to say to you.

That every word is true","Don't Cry for Me Argentina, song (for the musical Evita)"

Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor

Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Have you ever yearned to go
Past the world you think you know?
Been enthralled to the call
Of the beauty underneath?

Have you let it draw you in
Past the place where dreams begin?
Felt the full breathless pull
Of the beauty underneath?

When the dark unfolds its wings
Do you sense the strangest things?
Things no one would ever guess
Things mere words cannot express?

Yes

Do you find yourself beguiled
By the dangerous and wild?
Do you feed on the need
For the beauty underneath?

Have you felt your senses surge
And surrendered to the urge?
Have been hooked as you looked at the
At the beauty underneath?

When you stare behind the night
Can you glimpse its primal might?
Might you hunger to possess
Hunger that you can't repress?

Yes
It seems so beautiful
So strange yet beautiful
Everything's just as you say

And he's so beautiful
Perhaps too beautiful
What I suspect cannot be
And yet somehow, we both see
The very same way

Is the music in your head
Have you followed where it led?
And been graced with a taste
Of the beauty underneath?

Does it fill your every sense
Is it terribly intense?
Tell me you need it too
Need the beauty underneath

When it lifts its voice and sings
Don't you feel amazing things?
Things you know you can't confess
Things you thirst for nonetheless

It all so beautiful
Can it be?
Almost too beautiful
Do you see what I see?

To him it's beautiful
My world is beautiful
How can this be what it seems?
All of my most secret dreams
Somehow set free

You can feel the lift
(Yes)
Come closer
(Yes)
You've no fear of the beauty underneath

You can face it
(Yes)
You can take it

You see through to the beauty underneath

And the glory

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"I should have known that you'd be here
I should have known it all along
This whole arrangement bears your stamp
You're in each measure of that song
How dare you try and claim me now?
How dare you come invade my life?

Oh, Christine, my Christine
In that time when the world thought me dead
My Christine, on that night just before you were wed
Ah, Christine, you came and found where I hid
Don't you deny that you did
That long ago night

That night

Once there was a night beneath a moonless sky
Too dark to see a thing, too dark to even try
I stole to your side to tell you I must go
I couldn't see your face but sensed you even so

And I touched you
And I felt you
And I heard those ravishing refrains
The music of the pulse
The singing in your veins

And I held you
And I touched you
And embraced you
And I felt you

And with every breath and every sigh
I felt no longer scared
I felt no longer shy
At last our feelings bared
Beneath a moonless sky

And blind in the dark, as soul gazed into soul
I looked into your heart and saw you pure and whole
Cloaked under the night with nothing to suppress
A woman and a man, no more and yet no less

And I kissed you
And caressed you
And the world around us fell away
We said things in the dark
We never dared to say

And I caught you
And I kissed you
And I took you
And I begged you

With a need too urgent to deny
And nothing mattered then
Except for you and I
Again and then again
Beneath a moonless sky

And when it was done before the sun could rise
Ashamed of what I was, afraid to see your eyes
I stood while you slept and whispered a goodbye
And slipped into the dark beneath a moonless sky

And I loved you
Yes, I loved you
I'd have followed anywhere you led
I woke to swear my love
And found you gone instead

And I loved you
(How I loved you)
And I left you
(And I loved you)

And I had to, both of us knew why
We both knew why
And yet I won't regret
From now until I die
The night I can't forget

And now

Very nice, Meg
Do you think so, mother, really?
You've come a long way since the beginning of the season
Does he agree?
It's been three months, he never comes to see the show
Even a word from him, just one

You may get more than that

Then we'll go look for our friend and go see the island?
I'm sure he'll send for you when he's ready
Well, excuse me, miss, would you mind?

Heaven help me, could it be?
No, it couldn't possibly
Sorry, do I?
Yes, I think you do

It's rather high
Why, it's absurd
Oh, yes, I know

Inform your boss
That by the by

Here's how things appear, old friend
He who pays the bill

Be sure he will

That's all very well but till you're gone

Tomorrow night?
I'm afraid there must be some mistake

You can't be performing
Why?
Mainly, dear 'cause so am I
I'm in fact the star, for heaven's sake

What are you to sing?
Just one little thing, an aria
Please you needn't fret
I'm sure you will get your due

As an artist
What a surprise
To say the least

Yes, dear old friend
That's a happy tear, old friend
I can't conceal, try though I may
The way I feel so I pretend
I'm sure it's clear
To such a dear old friend

You mustn't stay
Why would I leave?
Why are we here?

Don't we all live here, old friends?

Such devoted and old friends

And for the rest
Why even start?

Is doing great
Won't this be fun?

Time runs dry
Still I ache down to the core

What an awful mistake to have come here
To be on display in that shameless way
For the crude common lower-class scum here

Come and see this toy I've got

What a snub at most from our so-called host
Did he think sending freaks would be funny?
Could the fool have thought that our pride was bought
By his filthy American money?
What a farce, what an outright slap in the face

He'll always be there
Singing songs in my head

You said yourself
He was nothing but a man
Yet while he lives
He will haunt us 'till we're dead

Twisted every way
What answer can I give?
Am I to risk my life
To win the chance to live?

Can I betray the man
Who once inspired my voice?
Do I become his prey
Do I have any choice?

He murders all that's good
I know I can't refuse
And yet, I wish I could

Of America tonight
I could almost see my house
I could almost see the rest of my life
And my mother's in the hospital
And my friends are in the news
Collecting trophies for the songs they wrote
While we lived in the shadow of the moon

Yes, I never made a gold record
And I've never been to Mars
But I've traveled around this world
Shooting fireworks and falling stars, and prison bars

And my father's got a decent job
And he's finally pulling through
There's more to life than singing songs we wrote
While we lived in the shadow of the moon

And I see colors when I hear your voice
Put on your wings that put gravity on trial
And I see colors, I don't hear the noise
Because we're only flying for a while
Because we're only flying for a while

Twisting high above the narrow beam
And my brother looked so proud
Like he woke up in this perfect dream

And I've known you all my life
But I knew you long before that tune
Let's go dancing to the songs we wrote
When we lived in the shadow of the moon

And I see colors when I hear your voice
Put on your wings that put gravity on trial
I see colors, I don't hear the noise
Because we're only flying for a while

And I could love you in the falling rain
Like many things, this is a storm we're meant to ride
Like synesthesia aboard a stalling plane
It's like we're only flying for a while
Flying for a while

Whoooaaaaaaa (x3)

And I see colors when I hear your voice
Put on your wings that put gravity on trial
I see colors, and I don't feel the choice
Because we're only flying for a while

And I could love you in the falling rain
Like many things, this is a storm we're meant to ride
Like synesthesia aboard a stalling plane
It's like we're only flying for a while

Flying for a while
Flying for a while
Flying for a while

After the last bullet tears through flesh and bone
After the last child starves and the last girl walks the boulevard
After the last year that's just too hard

There is love
Love, love, love
There is love
Love, love, love
There is love

After the last disgrace, after the last lie to save some face
After the last brutal jab from a poison tongue
After the last dirty politician, after the last meal down at the mission
After the last lonely night in prison

There is love
Love, love, love
There is love
Love, love, love
There is love

And in the end, the end is oceans and oceans of love and love again
We'll see how the tears that have fallen
Were caught in the palms of the Giver of love and the Lover of all
And we'll look back on these tears as old tales

'Cause after the last plan fails, after the last siren wails
After the last young husband sails off to join the war
After the last, this marriage is over
After the last young girl's innocence is stolen
After the last years of silence that won't let a heart open

Andrew Peterson,"One two three two.
It's so easy to cash in these chips on my shoulder,
So easy to lose this whole tongue like a tiger.
It's easy to let all this bitterness smolder,
Just to hide it away like a cigarette lighter.
It's easy to curse and to hurt and to hinder.
It's easy to not have the heart to remember 
That I am a priest and a prince in the kingdom of God.

I've got voices that scream in my head like a siren,
Fears that I feel in the night when I sleep.
Stupid choices I made when I laid in the mire,
Like a kid in the mud on some dirty, blind street.
I've got sorrow to spare, I've got loneliness too.
I've got blood on these hands that hold on to the truth,
That I am a priest and a prince in the kingdom of God.

Well I swore on the bible to not tell a lie, but I've lied and lied.
And I've crossed my heart and I hoped to die, and I've died and died.

But if it's true that you gathered my sin in your hand and you cast it as far as the east from the west,
If it's true that you put on the flesh of a man, and you walked in my shoes through the shadow of death,
If it's true that you dwell in the halls of my heart, then I'm not just a fool with a fancy guitar. 
No, I am a priest and a prince in the kingdom, I am a priest and a prince in the kingdom of God.",Fool with a Fancy Guitar
Andrew Peterson,"I remember once I broke down in the country
I was sixteen with a broken heart in bloom
And I walked home through the pines
Nobody saw me but the moon

By sunrise I could hear the church bells ringing
I got there as the saints were marching in
I sat down on the back row
And heard the story once again

And the servants of the secret fire
Were gathered there
The embers of the ages
Like a living prayer
And all at once I saw the shadows flee
Shine your light on me, on me
Be a light unto my path
And a lamp unto my feet

They flew us down to Oklahoma City
Yeah, but I could hardly stand there on the stage
So sick I couldn't speak
And the fever wouldn't break

But when I stepped up to the microphone I heard it
It was the voices of the brothers at my side
They were singing out my song
When the song in me had died

Oh, shine your light on me

Somebody come and get me when I'm gone

Two years ago I drove into a darkness
I straightened every curve on Cane Ridge Road
And I could hear the flapping wings
Of every devil I have known

And the inside of my car was like a casket
But then it flooded with a blaze of sacred light
She was calling me back home
And as I pulled into the drive

I knew the servants of the secret fire
Were gathered there
The embers of the ages
Like a living prayer
She was standing on the porch where I could see
Shine your light on me, on me
Be a light unto my path
And a lamp unto my feet",Shine Your Light on Me
Andrew Peterson,"Do you remember, Jody Baxter
When the whippoorwill sings
How you stole across the pasture
To the little hidden spring?
Where you laid down by the water
On a bed of Spanish moss
And dreamed

When wind was on the prairie
And the fire was in the stove
With the wood you had to carry
From the corner of the grove
And your daddy let you disappear
With all your fishing gear
Into the cove

And it was good, good, good
But now it's gone, gone, gone
And there's a little boy
Who's lost out in the woods
Always looking for the fawn

I remember, Jody Baxter
When I hid out in the corn
How the clouds were moving faster
With the coming of the storm
And I knew that I had broken
Something I could not repair
And I mourned

Because the field was green as Eden
Then it withered into brown
In the middle of my grieving
They came and cut it down
And I was sure that it was all my fault
The day they mowed the garden
To the ground

What was good, good, good
Is gone, gone, gone
And there's a little boy
Who's lost out in the woods
Always looking for the fawn

So come back to me
Please, come back to me
Is there any way that we can
Change the ending of this tragedy?
Or does it have to be this way?

I can see you, Jody Baxter
Now you're broken by the years
As you lie down in the aster
And listen for the deer
And I'm a million miles away
But I still pray the fawn can find me
Here",The Ballad of Jody Baxter
Andrew Peterson,"I will hold your hand, love
As long as I can, love
Though the powers rise against us
Though your fears assail you
And your body may fail you
There's a fire that burns within us

And we dream in the night
Of a city descending
With the sun in the center
And a peace unending

I will carry the fire for you

And we kneel in the water
The sons and the daughters
And we hold our hearts before us
And we look to the distance
And raise our resistance
In the face of the forces
Gathered against us

And we dream in the night
Of a king and a kingdom
Where joy writes the songs
And the innocent sing them

I will carry the fire for you

Oh, sing on, sing on
When your hope is gone
Sing on, sing on (Light up the darkness)

And we dream in the night
Of a feast and a wedding
And the groom in his glory
When the bride is made ready

I will carry the fire for you",Carry the Fire
Andrew Peterson,"I remember the day of the Tennessee flood
The sound of the scream and the sight of the blood
My son he saw as the animal died
In the jaws of the dog as the river ran by
I said, ""Come back soon.""

It's there on the page of the book that I read
The boy grew up and the yearling was dead
He stood at the gate with the angel on guard
And wept for the death of his little boy heart
I say, ""Come back soon.""

We wake in the night in the womb of the world
We beat our fists on the door
We cannot breathe in this sea that swirls
So we groan in this great darkness
For deliverance
Deliverance, O Lord

I sit on the bench at the bend in the trail
And I can feel in the fall the final exhale
The trees of the field all wring their hands
And the leaves go by like a funeral band
I say, ""Come back soon.""

We wake in the night in the womb of the world
We beat our fists on the door
We cannot breathe in this sea that swirls
So we groan in this great darkness
Are we alone in this great darkness?

If nature's red in tooth and in claw
Then it seems to me that she's an outlaw
'Cause every death is a question mark
At the end of the book of a beating heart
And the answer is scrawled in the silent dark
On the dome of the sky in a billion stars
But we cannot read these angel tongues
And we cannot stare at the burning sun
And we cannot sing with these broken lungs
So we kick in the womb and we beg to be born
Deliverance!
Deliverance, O Lord!",Come Back Soon
Andrew Peterson,"I saw the desert wind
Tear across the wilderness
I felt it blowing off the page
The teacher told me, ""Son,
Always remember this""
And I have always been afraid

I read about the God of Moses
Roaring in the holy cloud
It shook my bedroom window panes
I did not understand then
I do not understand now
I don't expect you to explain

You've been a mystery since the moment that I met you
You never move but I can never seem to catch you
The Cornerstone

You said to eat your flesh
Before you broke the bread and blessed it
Before you poured the wine for every man
This is a hard, hard teaching
Can any man accept it?
Can any sage here understand?

You turned the tables over
There in your father's temple
You cracked a whip and raised a shout
My daughter asked me why
I said, ""Love is never simple
It draws 'em in and drives 'em out.""

I saw you there but it was too late to change my course
And I collided with a beautiful immovable force
And so the stone that I rejected
It has become the Cornerstone

All the maps were drawn
But the maps were wrong
The stars spin around
Another sun
All the maps were drawn
But the maps were wrong
The rivers are running from
The Cornerstone

And you looked me in the eye and fixed me with a permanent stare
I met your gaze and saw the forges of the firmament there
The Cornerstone

And the floods come up
And the rains come down",The Cornerstone
Andrew Peterson,"Well, we took a train to Kensington
And listened to the children run
Just beyond the garden gate
Where Peter and Wendy played

There was a sign that said we weren't allowed
To duck inside and join the crowd
Without a son or daughter's hand
To lead us into Neverland

And it hurt so bad
But it's so good to be young
And I don't want to go back
I just want to go on and on and on
Day by day, day by day

And everybody's so surprised
When right before your very eyes
Your baby's in the second grade
You blink and it's her wedding day

And we just can't get used to being here
Where the ticking clock is loud and clear
Children of eternity
On the run from entropy

And it hurts so bad
But it's so good to be young
And I don't want to go back
I just want to go on and on and on
Day by day, day by day

So don't lose heart
Though your body's wasting away
Your soul is not
It's being remade
Day by day by day

Well, you have never met a single soul
Who didn't feel the curse's toll
Who didn't wish that death would die
Maybe that's the reason why

And it hurts so bad
But it's so good to be young
And I don't want to go back
I just want to go on and on and on

So don't lose heart
Though your body's wasting away
Your soul is not
It's being remade
So don't lose heart
Don't lose heart

Andrew Peterson,"Can't you feel it in your bones
Something isn't right here
Something that you've always known
But you don't know why

'Cause every time the sun goes down
We face another night here
Waiting for the world to spin around
Just to survive

But when you see the morning sun
Burning through a silver mist
Don't you want to thank someone?
Don't you want to thank someone for this?

Don't you ever wonder why
In spite of all that's wrong here
There's still so much that goes so right
And beauty abounds?

'Cause sometimes when you walk outside
The air is full of song here
The thunder rolls and the baby sighs
And the rain comes down

And when you see the spring has come
And it warms you like a mother's kiss
Don't you want to thank someone?
Don't you want to thank someone for this?

I used to be a little boy
As golden as a sunrise
Breaking over Illinois
When the corn was tall

Yeah, but every little boy grows up
And he's haunted by the heart that died
Longing for the world that was
Before the Fall

Oh, but then forgiveness comes
A grace that I cannot resist
And I just want to thank someone
I just want to thank someone for this

Now I can see the world is charged
It's glimmering with promises
Written in a script of stars
Dripping from prophets' lips

But still, my thirst is never slaked
I am hounded by a restlessness 
Eaten by this endless ache
But still I will give thanks for this

'Cause I can see it in the seas of wheat
I can feel it when the horses run
It's howling in the snowy peaks
It's blazing in the midnight sun

Just behind a veil of wind
A million angels waiting in the wings
A swirling storm of cherubim
Making ready for the Reckoning

Oh, how long, how long?
Oh, sing on, sing on

And when the world is new again
And the children of the King
Are ancient in their youth again
Maybe it's a better thing
A better thing

To be more than merely innocent
But to be broken then redeemed by love
Maybe this old world is bent
But it's waking up
And I'm waking up

'Cause I can hear the voice of one
He's crying in the wilderness
""Make ready for the Kingdom Come""
Don't you want to thank someone for this?

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Come back soon
Come back soon",Don't You Want to Thank Someone

But you're gonna grow up and you're gonna get lost
Just go back, go back

Go back, go back to the ancient paths
Lash your heart to the ancient mast
And hold on, boy, whatever you do
To the hope that's taken hold of you

Before you were mine
And I was dying to be with you
Now you've gone away
And I'm in this place

The shadow you cast just grows larger than life
How can the past cut two hearts like a knife?

I can't walk away
But how can I stay?
Any way I step I lose
My back's to the wall
I stumble and fall
Trying to live my life without you.

You weren't a saint
So what are these chains
You hold on both of us
You give it your best
But you can't forget
And my love's not strong enough
To put out a fire that someone else lit
Or walk in the footprints that never will fit.

Andromeda Turre,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me
Andromeda Turre,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Andru Donalds,"Here I am 
In a place that I have never been
Out of love
And afraid that you won't let me in (no)
You can't tell me and I started to feel
That my senses have left me to die
Where is my strength when I need it the most
Tell me what have you done with my mind 

[Chorus]
Oh save me now
From the depth of my infatuation
I could drown in this sea of love and isolation
I'll take you down
If you just save me now

All the time that I gave away 
I gave to you (oh)
And all the love that I never made
I'll make to you (yeah)
Nothing will be more electric to me 
Then to give you a taste of the love that I hide
In my condition I'm totally lost
Tell me what have you done with my pride

(And I'll stop loving you no way
Can't stop fantasizing

Oh save me now

More and more
Your kiss feels like an half open door
I can't get in
Please stop me before I begin
It hurts to be in love
When you've never gained enough
It hurts to be in love
Send this urge
Keeps my body right on the verge
We touch and then
I wanna do it over again
It's hurts to be in love
When you only want me half as much
It hurts to be in love
I'm always worried
You think that I'm pushing to hard
Baby it hurts me
When you tell me that I'm going to far

It's hurts to be in love
When you only want me half as much
Oh baby it hurts
It's hurts to be in love

The relationship was fine
Till I looked and saw tomorrow
Why should I be lonely
When I looked deep in your mind, I could see
Your lies turn my joy to sorrow

You did everything to blow my mind
You did everything to cross the line 
You did everything to blow my mind
But you dipped your fingers in muddy water 

You're controlling and saving
Why you played those silly games
All your lovers seem to follow
I'm so wounded in misery
I don't need to hear your words
Can you feel my pain through your alibies

You did everything to blow my mind
You did everything to cross the line

Where you will end up the next day
Our week: sometimes you live in a black world
Or maybe in a white world
I´d rather the multiracial world - but hey
Living in every situation makes you stronger
Than you ever believe, ever believe

[Chorus]
Some day - the innovation of life - you´ll see
Some day - the difference means everything to me
For I´ll be giving everything that you´re bargain for
I don´t think I´ll never walk out my door
Some day, some way

While from the third world
My eyes twinkle a little differently
My smell a little less muggy - for all
That sunshine gives you an air
Of arrogance, happiness and sweetness
In the way you carry yourself
More sexual, sensual, than the average man of the world

Every minute, every hour gotta now, gotta feel, gotta want to take the time

Andru Donalds,"I see I read our lives in the news
It said our inner fate is whether we win or lose
Can`t you see there`s always a way to never waste time
Inner faith and dreams release the tension

Unchain your mind
Unchain your mind

The day can never happen waiting for the hurricane
If we look to far ahead today is gone
You will always miss the moment waiting for the hurricane

Cause the fear of future hides the sun

If you can`t seem to find new oceans and a little bit more
Slowly we will fall if we lose sight of the shore
In the race to be the better or best
Don`t miss it, the joy of being, or you will never rest

Palabras que no olvido
Cogidos de la mano fuimos poquito a poquito
Veranos de locura inviernos de ternura

Miradas que no ocultan el sentir de mi fortuna
Batallas a deriva que conquista
Mis labios paseos por la playa
Anocheceres de infarto

Y en la primavera
No hay niña más morena, en to' mi reino
Dame un besito de los que llegan al corazón
Dame un abrazo de los que juegan con la ilusión
Dame un besito de los que llegan al corazón
Dame un abrazo de los que juegan con la ilusión

A veces me huyen, a veces se queda
A veces se enfada y no entiendo a mi morena
Digo que la quiero, digo que la odio
Pero siempre al final volvemos juntos, juntos como tontos

Oye, oye morena dame un besito
De los que tu sueltas en la primavera
Pero oye, oye mi niña dame un besito
De los que tu sueltas con la primavera

Pero oye pero que mira oye morena
Ay corazón ay mira niña que tu sabes
Que el amor, oye pero que sabes
Que el amor pero niña no me juegues con mi corazón

De los que llegan de los que faltan
A veces te huyen a veces se quedan
A veces se enfadan y no entiendo a mi morena

I'm tied to your apron strings and there's nothing I can do

I say to myself you're such a lucky guy,
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
out of all the fellows in the world she belongs to me.
But it was Just my imagination,
once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo
 
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three.
I tell you I can visualize it all 
this couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems;
But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
 
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.
 
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.

Andy Abraham,"Lady, morning's just a moment away, 
And I'm without you once again.
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me,
I wonder if you need me now.
We played the grams that people play, we made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Remembering the pain, if I must say, it's deep in my mind and locked away,
But then most of all, I do love you 
Still.
 
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,
Those feelings we can't put aside.
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand, 
But it's so heavy on my mind.
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.
But then most of all, I do love you
Still.
 
We played the games that people play, 
We made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.

I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.

Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.

Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.

Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Qué será de mi vida qué será

Si tú no estas amor (si tú no estas amor)

Tú no sabes cómo duele tu adiós

Tengo herida el alma why el corazón

Porque tú no estás


Ay fueron noches de pasión

Cuando le entregué mi corazón

Cuando yo le dí mi vida entera

why bajo la luna pasabamos la noche en vela

Yo te amaba

Llegue a quererte más que a todo más que a nada

Eras tú la que en mis sueños siempre estaba

why de besos mil caricias te colmaba

Por favor regresa

No puedo aguantar esta soledad

Qué será de mi vida qué será

Esta bachata es pa' que esto se encienda

Con el más que canta (con Andy Aguilera)

No lo entiendo

Como te alejaste de mi vida

No comprendo

Ahora yo no encuentro una salida

why me atormento pensando en tí

Queriendo tenerte why tu no estas aquí

Parado en mi ventana

Veo como pasan las noches las mañanas

Como se ha quedado vacía mi casa

Reina de mi alma dueña mi cama

Te fuiste why no dijiste nada


Ay mi amor perdido dónde estará

No puedo aguantar esta soledad

Que será de mi vida que será

Tú no sabes como duele tu adiós

Wishing is good time wasted,
Still it's a habit they say,
Wishing for sweet's I've tasted,
That's all I do all day.
Maybe there's nothing in wishing,
But, speaking of wishing I'll say,

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

When the morning glories
Twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early
In the morning.

Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.
If I had Aladdin's lamp
For only a day
I'd make a wish
And here's what I'd say

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

Dreaming was meant for night time
I live in dreams all the day, 
I know it's not the right time,
But still I dream away
What could be sweeter than dreaming,
Just dreaming and drift away. 

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter

Andy Anselmo,"Every time it rains
It rains pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven
You'll find your fortune
Fallin' all over town
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love
You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven
For you and me

Andy Anselmo,"The torch I carry is handsome
It's worth its heartache in ransom
Now when that twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels
When I want rain, I get sunny weather
I'm just as blue, blue as the sky
Since love has gone, I can't get myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
My friend ask me out, but I tell them I'm busy
I've got to get a new alibi
I hang around at home, and ask myself, where is she?
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops
Moving on a stream of dreams
My little memories, those precious memories
Remind me of our crazy schemes
Then somebody says, just forget about her
But I gave that treatment a try
Strangely enough, I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by, oh well

I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,

Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

Andy Anselmo,"Ollie told me I'm a fool. 
So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee, 
And what do you think he said to me?

When you awake you will remember ev'rything, 
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe, 
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

Ollie showed me the fork in the road.
You can take to the left or go straight to the right,
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

[Chorus]

Ollie warned me it's a mean old world,
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true;
But what am I supposed to do:
Read the writing on the wall,
I heard it when I was very small.

[Chorus]

Wash my hand in lye water, 
I got a date with the captains daughter. 
You can go and tell your brother. 
We sure gonna love one another, oh! 
You may be right and ya might be wrong, 
I ain't gonna worry all day long.

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite, 
My old car froze up last night. 
Ain't no reason to hang your head 
I could wake up in the mornin' dead. 
Oh! And if I thought it would do any good, 
I'd stand on the rock where Moses stood.",Lazy Afternoon

I didn't like your dresses
Thought you would move
To another part of town

I got your message
Been sifting through the wreckage
For this excuse
We call a life

A DIY quickie slow divorce
Marriage vows broken on the rocks
Mine's a slice with a G&T
And here's to toast that you're leaving me

I will not cry 'til the fat lady sings
I cannot fly 'cause you've clipped my wings
Now you're the picture of my disgrace
So wipe that pretty smile off your face

I wouldn't say we were incomplete
I can't complain you were so discreet
Kept your liaisons to yourself
My soul distraught now I'm getting out

You were delicious
Could never be malicious
Now you hold a knife up
To my throat

Of it's own volition
You took your ammunition
Came rushing through the air
Like a UFO

I cannot say that I learned my lesson well
Mysterious ways got a lot to tell
Sure got a wicked sense of humor
You stick that knife in and twist it round

I will not cry 'til the fat lady sings
I cannot fly 'cause you've clipped my wings
Now you're the picture of my disgrace
So wipe that pretty smile off your face

I wouldn't say we were incomplete
I can't complain you were so discreet

The only difference is the name

If you're alone, whether on Main Street, or on Broadway

If you're alone, they are both the same, a town's a lonely  town

When you pass through and there is no one waiting there for you

Andy Bey,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life...
From jazz and cocktails.

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day...
Twelve o'clock tales.

Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.

Ah yes! I was wrong...
Again,
I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
I'll live a lush life in some small dive...
And there I'll be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too..",Lush Life

Cause some old friend is bound to ask me why you're not around
Well I just stay away, so I don't have to say

I wouldn't know I haven't seen him
I couldn't say it's been awhile
I haven't thought about him lately
So I wouldn't know
I'm getting tired of people askin' 
Why can't they just leave me alone

Andy Chrisman,"﻿첫 번째 앨범은 시큰둥
두 번째는 대중들의 작은 집중 뿐
세 네 번째 부터
이 썩은 scene의 귀중품
새빨간 19금 딱지가 붙었지만
still 진실만을 썼다
음악은 나의 길
심의실에서 평가 불능한 appeal
득과 실 벌써 decade
Still mic를 check 해
Like JK형 밝은 미래 in my arms
실낱 꿈 풍파와 입맞춤
가사를 쓸 때마다
혼자가 아니야 in my room
내게 숨 같던
친구들의 반이 하늘나라
내가 대신 꾸는 꿈 속에서
편히 잠을 자라
맺힌 내 땀을 봐라
I\'m a damn 괴물
Made an independent label
cause I won\'t ever settle
at your level

몰락 속에 피로 차올라

처음엔 지루한
학창 시절을 열 창이었다
모든 게 좋아 고통은 먼 산이었다
부모는 답이 없다
친구는 관심 없다며
모두가 벽을 만들고서
난 남이었다
몇 해간 수돗물이 밥이라도
사방에 짙은 안개뿐인 반 지하도
견디고 버티다 보니 뭐 괜찮았어
그래도 택시 타는 녀석은
좀 배 아팠어
하나 둘 배고픔에 떠나갈 때
나 역시 고민했었지만
결과는 반대
하나 둘 팬들이 더 쌓여갈 때
음악과 맘은 같았지만
뭘 하든 깠네
그래도 뭐 어쩌겠어
잡초 같은 걸
아직도 빛나는 그 애들처럼
산소 같은 걸
그냥 좀비처럼 걸어 세상을 얻다
모든 걸 고통 없이
원한다면 해답은 없다
내가 해냈으면 너도
충분히 할 수 있으니 believe

서러웠던 날의 어깨의 먼지 털어

I\'m insane in the brain

Cypher\'s killed when I rap
얼굴 찌푸리면서
Like a drummer in the back
너넨 뒷북이나 쳐
마음이 뒤틀린
낙서 가득 기운이 앞서
누구나 깎아내는
조각가들 신물이 났어
차라리 신문이나 펴
요즘의 경제면처럼 마땅한
대안 없는 음악 믿음이 안 서
착실한 기반 닦은 확실한 상품
어설픈 화가들의 막 칠한 작품
둘 중 하나를 분명히 해
이력서를 써
결과야 뭐 어떻던 미련은 못써

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain

What's the name of the game? (Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do?
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow

And you make me talk
And you make me feel
And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you, would you let me down?
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know
Oh yes I wanna know

The name of the game  (I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you?  (But I think I can see in your face)
(That it means a lot)

Andy Findon,"They passed me by, all of those great romances
You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy
And so I dealt you the blow
One of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
One of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all
Never left at all

Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call",One of Us
Andy Findon,"I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?

Andy Findon,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.
 
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad,
And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",The Winner Takes It All
Andy Findon,"There's a lady who's sure 
All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows 
If the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
In a tree by the brook 
There's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll. 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.",Stairway to Heaven

Memories that must fade
Dusty and forgotten by and by

The spotlight's burning down into my face
The drummer sits up high upon his rostrum
Guitarists play each other face to face
And when it's over , I'll stop and wonder
And never understand
'cause leaving this was never in my plans
And when I'm playing all I see is things you'll never find
Flowing rivers passing through my mind

Deceiving and receiving was my pastime
to every girl who liked my written lines
They'd think that any moment I'd be their guy
But crying never justified my lies , oh no
And next time 'round will be the same
They never understand that hurting them was never in my plans
My songs will slow like passing clouds
Something in each line
Flowing rivers passing through my mind

I've got to go , I've finished what I came for
Playing every city , state to state
Singing every town that learned to like me
Modest payments paid for what I ate
Ah, you're standing there , tears in your eyes
You once called me a man
And loving you was never in my plans

Andy Gibb,"I'm a man on fire
It's a burning thing 
It'll burn on forever 
If you feed me baby
I'm a man on fire
An eternal flame
It'll burn on forever
If you feed me baby , oh 

Gotta be a place to go in the midnight hour
Heart of a women and just a little bit of pulling power
The feelings got me 
I don't know what it means
I know it must be wrong
But when you love somebody you dream 
And I dream 
I save the love down deep inside me
for the moment when you come 
And you're there , and you're gone 
And I'm alive for you 
And my love keeps hanging on 

There is no life 
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love 
There is no unifying , if I don't hear you crying
I'm yours , you're mine , no power in the world
Together we are strong in love 
And when your storm is over, I'll show how warm my love can be
And me , I'm a man on fire 

I'm a man on fire
It's a burning thing 
It'll burn on forever
If you feed me baby
I'm a man on fire
An eternal flame
It'll burn on forever
If you feed me baby , oh

Ready when the lightning strikes and he deed is done 
I'm not a beginner
But I'm a sinner when the heat is on
Nothing gonna stop me , got me all that you need 
Woman when you need somebody
A woman with a face and a body , you dream 
And I dream 

I save the love down deep inside me 
For the moment when you come
And you're there and you're gone 
And I'm alive for you 
And my love keeps hanging on 

There is no life 
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love
There is no unifying
If I don't hear you crying 
I'm yours, you're mine , no power in the world 
Together we are strong enough
And when your storm is over

Andy Gibb,"Without you , stood alone on the edge of time
Out of sight,but forever mine, without you
Sometime's there's no forgetting the night
When you reach for the stars ,just to be where it's bright
But you left me behind , what a crazy goodbye

Without you, there ain't no love at all 
And without you , there ain't no plans at all
Without you , ev'rything's lost to the wind
You were the love I was in 
How can I try to be me
Without you

(break)

Without you, watching you take the world from me
Leaving me with a memory about you
Sometime's there's no forgetting the place
Where you told me goodbye ,like a slap in the face
Where you tore me apart and I learned how to cry

Without you , there ain't no love at all
And without you , there ain't no plans at all 
Without you , ev'rything's lost to the wind 
You were the love I was in 
How can I try to be me

Without you , there ain't no love at all 
Without you baby, there ain't no plans at all
Girl, without you , ev'rything's lost to the wind
You were the love I was in 
How can I try to be me, me 
Without you , without you honey , ah...
Without you , ev'rything's lost ...(fade)

Andy Gibb,"Time it goes on 
Waits for nobody special
In the prime of my years I'll remember you
Living and breathing and some misbelieving 
But I can't hold you woman 
No piece of you 

You were the magic 
My only believer 
My life on the line for you 
All that I give to you 
Time is time
Don't give me no time to waste away 
Love is love
Keep me alive to my dyin' day 
Now is now 
We capture the world
And our love will make it all right, all right 

Time it goes on 
Waits for nothing or no one
But I still see your sun that you shine on me
Giving and taking and always mistaking 
But I'll follow you woman eternally 

Setting my sights in one only direction 
Searching for romance and showing affection 
I guess I've been a no one
Standing in the cold dark waiting for your love

Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in makin' love
Love is love 
Turn me around till you burn me up 
Now is now
We master the world
In time we'll make it all right, all right 

Time is time 
Don't give me no wrong
Don't give me no wrong",Time Is Time
Andy Gibb,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Love Me Tomorrow
Andy Gibson,"Old people make me cry
Goodbyes make me drink
Tom Petty makes me drive too fast
The Bible makes me think
Children make me laugh
My mama makes me wanna treat a lady right
Like Daddy always has

You make me wanna buy a rose
You make me wanna shine my shoes
Baby, you make me wanna dance
Better than I do
You make me wanna be a man
Who makes ya laugh and makes ya cry
Wanna be everything you need
You make me wanna make you love me

Girl, I'm not poetry
I'm not the finest wine
But I'll toast to you and me
And I'll try to make it rhyme
I'll learn your favorite song
Stand in the yard with my guitar
And sing outside your window all night long

You make me wanna buy a rose
You make me wanna shine my shoes
Baby, you make me wanna dance
Better than I do
You make me wanna be a man
Who makes ya laugh and makes ya cry
Wanna be everything you need
You make me wanna make you love me

You make me wanna buy a ring
You make me wanna put you first

Backwards standing in the summer sun
Toes in the sand and a July tan
Oh, baby, tell me what's not to love

Your mama didn't like me 
Or the way that you loved me
She prayed that it was a summer thing
You thought I was wild
And I didn't say it at the time
But you're my first time for everything

Oh, there's nothing I'd change about those days
You're the sweetest thing about my past
There's a part of me that hopes you found your dreams
And you're happy wherever you're at
There's a part of me that wants that summer back

We burned both ends of that beach town
Till they shut down the midway
We tried to hold on, but that warm breeze was gone
Yeah, fall changed everything

But there's nothing I'd change about those days
You're the sweetest thing about my past
There's a part of me that hopes you found your dreams
And you're happy wherever you're at
There's a part of me that wants that summer back

There's a picture of you and me I keep
It reminds me that we were real
Girl, I sure do miss that beach
And the way that you made me feel

But there's nothing I'd change about those days
You're the sweetest thing about my past

Andy Gorwell,"Bound down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go 
Til I outrun your memory 
I can't go home cause I can't face another day alone 
Now that you're gone this ain't no place for me 
I want to start all over new 
But I can't lose these lonesome highway blues 
Down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go 
Til I outrun your memory 

Bound down that long, lonesome highway just as fast as I can fly 
Just want to go to someplace you won't be 
I'm movin' on to a new place and hold my head up high 
Where no one knows what you done to me 
A thousand miles between us now 
And still some how 
These blues'll track me down 
Down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go 
Til I outrun your memory 

I'm bound down that long lonesome highway cause it's the only place I know 
Where there ain't no clouds hangin' over me 
Leave me alone cause it's a long way no matter where I go 
Nothin' but blues as far as I can see 
I wish I had you back again 
But I know I can't

Andy Grammer,"I was nearly a soul getting ready to go
Having one last talk with my maker
He said you're going to earth for better or worse
We'll see you back here sooner or later

So I said to him, as I spread my wings
Would you do one thing for me

Would you build me a girl from all over the world
I promise I will always adore you
Made in Japan, with style of Milan and a smile from California
Brazilian walk, hair from New York, pretty Parisian curls
Build me a girl
Build me a girl

Well the days went by
Wondering why, why it was I hadn't found her
I was staring at eyes
Smiling at smiles
Still I was none the wiser

And you know I don't
Don't mean to impose
But I thought we had a deal

You would you build me a girl from all over the world
I promise I will always adore you
Made in Japan, with style of Milan and a smile from California
Brazilian walk, hair from New York, pretty Parisian curls
Build me a girl
Build me a girl

So calling all woman who fit this description
If I'm what you're missing
Then please just listen to the wind
The clouds they're all screaming out,
They're trying to bring you to me
So please don't shut them out
Because there is a lady who is made for me
Yes, there is a lady who's been made for me

Cause I said build me a girl from all over the world
I promise I will always adore you
Made in Japan, with style of Milan and a smile from California
Brazilian walk, hair from New York and pretty Parisian curls
Build me a girl

Build me a girl from all over the world
I promise I will always adore you

I just wrote a lyric that made me stop
Think about the world and what I got
It's a beautiful, beautiful day

I got dreams for food and hope for drink
A new chance coming every time I blink
Sunset dripping off the thoughts I think
It's a beautiful, beautiful day

And maybe I should care more about safety
But I can't ignore or betray these voices singing

Crazy would be changing your mind
You can do this, you can do this
You are not a lu-lunatic
Crazy would be leaving it behind

I've got five bucks waiting on a matinee
I love to see films in the middle of the day
Same movie seen a different way
I don't think that makes me crazy
And I start work on the opposite side, of the clock
Tic tock clubs open at nine
I like to rock till the early daylight
Write music till five, this is my life

Maybe I should care more about safety
But I can't ignore or betray these voices singing

[Chorus]

I will wiggle in a straight jacket forever
This is not some slight disease we can try and cure
This is one thing in my life that I know for sure
There is no turning back now

And maybe I should care more about safety
But I can't ignore or betray these voices singing

I want a bass and back beat to lock in
I want to know real love's not forgotten

I want a teacher who's eager to speak her mind
Delicate features, sweet with her tongue so kind
I'm looking for the markers that say ""permanent"" so we can share
I'm looking for a love still alive and well in rocking chairs
I want faithful, and stable, and able

Because you've been burned before
You tell me that everything that is good will end
You were building castles in the air
But they fell to the ground there was nothing there
You said you'd never get so close again

And lately, it's yellow lights and you're breaking
Say you just want to wait and see it all unfold
But baby when you find what you're seeking
Something you can believe in you just got to go

So let's not take it slow
Let's not take it slow
I don't want to take it slow

I don't want to rush your love
But I can never get enough
I'm sitting outside your door
I give you everything you need
Sunshine, the world and all your dreams
So what are we waiting for

I don't want to take it slow

Waiting for the perfect storm
We've been slowly chasing love
Now it's time to cross the line
And I want more oh

Say you just want to wait and see it all unfold

But here we are wrapped up in silence
Can we sound the alarm?
Both so defiant
I don't know where to start
I keep colliding with
The one I, one I love

Don't make it so hard for me to stay

You should know better than that
And before you go on breaking my heart
And I fall even deeper in love
And my lungs screaming out ""Can you hear me?!""
You should know better than that
And here we are, here we are, oh

If I could leave, I would be leaving
Because I cannot believe what I am hearing
Tell me how can it be I'm second guessing on
The one I, one I love

Don't make it so hard for me to stay

You should know better than that
And before you go on breaking my heart
And I fall even deeper in love
And my lungs screaming out
""Can you hear me?!""
You should know better than that
And here we are, here we are, oh
Here we are, here we are again

Some forgive just to forget
I've not forgotten yet
I still believe in you
But there's a crack in our cement
This time it's permanent, permanent

You should know

You should know better than that
And before you go on breaking my heart
And I fall even deeper in love
And my lungs screaming out
""Can you hear me?!""

You should know better than that
And here we are, here we are, oh

And spin me like a ceiling fan, oh

Andy Grammer,"I know you didn't think that loving me meant so much time alone
Dinner for one on the couch, another movie on your own
You know that I'm never gonna be a nine to five, that was never me
I was born with a compass in my hand and a restless soul

But when it hurts, when you can't take it
And when the rubber band feels like it's breaking

Hear the kick drum, that's my heart right there
Let the melody run its fingers through your hair
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight
And my vocals tickle your ear
And you almost can feel me here
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight

As far as ladies go, baby you should know you're so patient
You're a thick skin, definition of low maintenance
But it's enough, time goes by
You can help but dim your light
An empty house can make a cold heart feel so naked

But when it hurts, when you can't take it
And when the rubber band feels like it's breaking

You hear the kick drum, that's my heart right there
Let the melody run its fingers through your hair
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight
And my vocals tickle your ear
And you almost can feel me here
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight

Yeah, oh, let me be your
Be your second home for a while
Home, all you've ever known
So baby listen close for me inside

And hear the kick drum, that's my heart right there
Let the melody run its fingers through your hair
When my piano will kiss you slow

And hear the kick drum, that's my heart right there
Let the melody run its fingers through your hair
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight
And my vocals tickle your ear
And you almost can feel me here
And my piano will kiss you slow tonight
Will kiss you slow tonight
Will kiss you slow tonight
Will kiss you slow tonight",Kiss You Slow
Andy Grammer,"Life is a canvas, a painting in my mind
Colors stay and spill outside the lines
I refuse to settle, never the black and white
Rock the neons until the day I die
I'm on a constant search to make my heart swell
Bite off too much, chew like hell
Half my nights spent in a hotel
Price I pay to escape the conveyor belt

One, you get one heartbeat so take it seriously
This is your masterpiece, don't forget to dream
And taste the colors in the air you breathe
It's your masterpiece, go ahead and fill it all
Don't stop til it is beautiful
Don't stop til it is beautiful
Don't stop til it is beautiful

Close my eyelids, take a deep breath
Feel the lightning down in my chest
I'm just a piece of art and the paint's fresh
'Cause I'm not near finished yet
I've got a pregnant mind that wants to give birth
Breathe life into these big words
I can hear the universe, in my ears she whispers.

One, you get one heartbeat so take it seriously
This is your masterpiece, don't forget to dream
And taste the colors in the air you breathe
It's your masterpiece, go ahead and fill it all
Don't stop til it is beautiful
Don't stop til it is beautiful
Don't stop til it is beautiful

And if you settle for a normal life
Say you're afraid of heights
But you were meant to light the sky

This is your masterpiece, don't forget to dream
And taste the colors in the air you breathe
This is your masterpiece, go ahead and fill it all
Don't stop til it is beautiful
Don't stop til it is beautiful
Don't stop til it is beautiful
Don't stop til it is beautiful
Don't stop til it is beautiful",Masterpiece

For some want to stand their ground when I start to tear them down

I'm pushing you away but that's not what I mean
Oh I'm ashamed that I cannot believe
That this is what it takes just to get close to me
Is this what it takes just to get close to me?

Andy Grammer,"I lost perspective of who I was, I hit the wall
I knew that it would take a lot but it took it all
No you don't come this far to turn around, covered too many miles
No you don't get this close to breaking down just to close your eyes

While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
I'm chasing myself in the sky
While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
I'll be up here learning to fly
When you know that you can't let go
And your heart already knows
Sure to hurt but it's worth it to be burned
'Cause one day you'll get home
Still it feels like I am always on the red eye

This time around it's not even about getting paid
I'm just an addict for the moment when the magic is made
And when you are who you are who you really are
It can put you through hell
Spend a day in the skin that you want to live in
To see how it feels

While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
I'm chasing myself in the sky
While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
I'll be up here learning to fly
When you know that you can't let go

Still it feels like I am always on the red
It feels like I am always on the red eye

I'm finding myself these days
Looking down from a window shade
I'm counting lies on hours
Just when I should be counting sheep
Truth is I can't complain
I do it over and over again and over again

While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
I'm chasing myself in the sky
While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
I'll be up here learning to fly

While the world sleeps under my feet tonight

Or that you got low self-esteem
We all got hearts that forget why they beat
We are brilliant, we are unique
But we forget so effortlessly

And your version of amnesia starts to seep on through
And you know that you are great but you can't remember why
I will be there by your side

I will remind you, I will remind you
I will be, I'll be your memory

And brick by brick and piece by piece
And love in both your hands
Try to make an honest man
From when I woke until I went to sleep

Sculpted me like clay, I can see you in my face

From where you are to where I am
But I don't feel a thing

And send on down a message please
Light a boat, go home my dreams

That you hear me, that you're close

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

You let your sweet love shine on me

Andy Griggs,"I've lived my life like a one way ticket
Not knowing where I'm bound
About killed myself just to prove I was alive
Then all of a sudden with a whole lot of lovin'
You turned my world around
So don't worry if I'm ever gonna walk the line
Yeah I'll be true, but baby I can't lie

[Chorus]
I've been known to get a little rowdy
And crazy when I can
I can get a little loud
I get a little lazy
And a little bit out of hand
I got a good side bad side
Sometimes just this side of sanity
But turning my back on you
Is a side of me you'll never see

I've been in the middle
I've been on the edge
Been a diamond in the rough
But baby I'll bet that you can smooth me out
No I'm not perfect
But for what it's worth
You can count on this boy's love
I can see where you might have your doubt
But let me tell you what I'm all about

Andy Griggs,"Jimmy was waitin' on shelby jean
In the parking lot at the dairy queen
He knew she's gonna be there soon
Then they'll blow this town
Like a cheap balloon

She came in cryin' this morning at the store
Said, i swear jimmy, i just can't take no more
So he quit his job and drew his pay
Now he's helpin' shelby make her getaway

Oh...sittin' on go
Waitin' on sundown
Waitin' on sundown
No more beatin' to be denied
No more bruises that makeup can't hide
All these years she's tried to love that man
But all he ever gave her
Was the back of his hand

Now, jimmy is a young boy
Just out of his teens
So many things that he still hasn't seen
But he's old enough to know wrong from right
That's why he's helpin' shelby
Make her break tonight

And oh...sittin' on go
Waitin' on sundown
Waitin' on sundown
Waitin' on sundown
Drove all night drove all day
Jimmy listened to everything shelby had to say
How she'd suffered at her lover's hand
He said honey i want to change all that if i can
They pulled over to take a little rest
Shelby put her head down on jimmy's chest
And she could hear the beatin' of his heart
And it sounded like the rhythm of a brand new start

And oh she's gonna let him know

She's just waitin' on sundown

Like the beat when an old sun record plays
And if I turn my back when the train is comin'

Who knew there'd come a day
I would come alive like this

If I moan at the sound of a certain name
And if I lean just this side of illegal

'Cause when I walked beside you, I was walkin' in the sun
And like a fool I ran, like a lonesome highway runs
Always...

I've had my live together now at least a thousand times
But it seems that satisfaction never was a friend of mine
The way we laughed, the way we cried, and how it hurt to say goodbye
How long can I keep missin' you this way

Always...
I sat and watched the talk, drop acres at my feet
I thought about the good times, and how good they used to be
And then I watched your memory, scattered like dry leaves

Always...
Now the wind fades to a whisper, but still I hear your name
I guess that some things in this life, are never gonna change
Though every day is different, my love for you remains

Andy Griggs,"I've learned that sex can sell anything on TV.

And I've learned that politics and acting are the same profession.

Down the Louisiana swamp to Beinja Bayo
The prettiest site I ever did see was the Cajun girls
On them awesome trees

People all a-comin' from near and far
To drink their tea from a old fruit jar

And I call my fightin' alligator

Andy Griggs,"North Louisiana on a Saturday night
I was sittin' in the glow of the dashboard lights
I'll never forget I was six years old
When I heard comin' out of my daddys radio
Came out of my seat and said, ""Son of a gun""
And daddy said, ""Now that's the Opry son""

I heard the crowd start screamin'
And I started dreamin'
Of one day runnin'
With a Hillbilly band

Bought a guitar, learned a few chords
Found a few guys and a beat up Ford
Pretty girls would come from miles around
Like bees to honey to hear that sound
All we could afford was bread and mayonnaise
Living for the moment when we'd hit that stage

I heard the crowd start screamin'
Man you ain't livin'
Till you go runnin'
With a Hillbilly band

I came to Nashville, they liked my songs
I got a bus forty-five feet long
Bought a house to put a gold record on the wall
The funny thing is I'm hardly there at all
The money, the cars, you can have that stuff
Just give me what I love

To hear the crowd start screamin'
To the song I'm singin'
The one about runnin'
With a Hillbilly band

Yeah Hillbilly band
Woo it's a Hillbilly band
You all it's a Hillbilly band

Cause, baby, you sure did do it well

And sometimes I fight it still
I'm finding fast that I can't leave you

Andy Griggs,"If heaven was an hour, it would be twilight
When the fireflies start their dancin on the lawn
And suppers on the stove, and mammas laughin
And everybodys workin day is done

If heaven was a town it would be my town
On a summer day in 1985
And everything i wanted was out there waitin
And everyone i loved was still alive

don't cry a tear for me now baby
There comes a time we all must say goodbye
And if that's what heavens made of
You know what I ain't afraid to die

If heaven was a pie it would be cherry
Cool and sweet and heavy on the top
And just one bite would satisfy your hunger
Thered always be enough for everyone

If heaven was a train it sure would be a fast one
To take this weary travler round the bend
And if heaven was a tear it'd be my last one
And you'd be in my arms again

don't cry a tear for me now baby
There comes a time we all must say goodbye
And if that's what heavens made of
You know what I ain't afraid to die",If Heaven

'Cause every night since your goodbye

Pretty city lights down far below
Sittin' there soakin' up all of the heat of the fire

Bein' here with you girl, nothing could get me no higher

Never let me touch the ground

You were born to spread those angel wings
Every time you touch me, swear I feel light as a feather
But it seems like every other corner I turn
There's another busted heart that's crashed and burned
Baby, just remember every time you take me to heaven

(Chorus)

So, tell me once again how high we're gonna go
Take me far away from the world below
We could be the few that make it all the way together
Cause I could start this car and drive back into town
Land us both safe on solid ground
But after tonight, girl, you're gonna have to love me forever

And she was gigglin', my name is Caroline

Which pretty end she had it inked in
Forbidden, well hidden
Underneath her clothes

And I asked, where is your little secret?
She said, you know I keep it

Just a little south of my Mason-Dixon tan line
This yellow rose of Texas, that's right
Has never seen the sunshine

Since that spring break down in Key West
Oh, what a beautiful canvas
For a little tattoo rose

The way she moved it
And grooved it to the music
Was soakin' up my mind
And getting me high

And I said, I gotta know
Just how low it really goes
Hey baby, just maybe
You could show me sometime

She said, don't think so, honey
Boy, you should get so lucky

The fact you're gone away, now
God knows I've tried
And nothing I can do can stop the rain
From falling on my face, now, every night

I'm stuck here in the past
I can't move on, I can't go back
It's just not fair
I wake up in a sweat, all soaking wet
I reach out, but you're not there

So I cry
And watch the days roll by
I miss the way you love me
And I die down deep inside
But I will survive,
Just give me tears and time

Tears can wash away the emptiness
Take it like a river to the sea
Time can wrap its arms around the pain
'Til it becomes a tender memory

I'm still here all alone
The world's so dark, since you've been gone
It's just not fair
I call out your name
But there's just silence, always the same
Unanswered prayer

So I cry
And watch the days roll by
I miss the way you love me
And I die down deep inside
But I will survive
Just give me tears and time

Washed my hands of all the pieces

Blaming everybody else for the bad breaks
Me, fooling myself, calling it the hand I'm dealt
I'm sure that it's her, but what if it's me

What if it's me, my own worst enemy
Not giving her enough attention
Ignoring all the little things
Now I lie here all alone
Getting lost in her prediction

Blaming everybody else for the bad breaks

I'm sure that it's her, but what if it's me

Me, who needs to take the blame
For doing this to us

Smiling, raining down like sun
Smiling and in my soul I see you as you are
Smiling on and on and on

Holding the world in hand
Spinning round at your command
You are in every DNA
Your signature displayed

Where I never knew
And now I've found it
It's always been you

Offer up a world in your hand
Crossing tide and time to bring me home

Blinded I stumbled through each day
Chasing the answers in the dark

Swimming against the tide
I struggled to reach the other side
But I knew you'd be there
With a signal and flare to save me

When I'm feeling blue
Black and white seem to follow me
Technicolour light filters through the haze

When I'm hearing gray
Cut the noise, find some clarity
Stereophonic sound
Racing through my veins

You pulled me through into the light
Locked in your gaze, I feel alive
I've shed my skin, learnt from the pain
Reborn from within. Reality changed

Clouds are feathers from a lady's fan
Do you remember how we watched them drifting by
Long ago when love began
 
Clouds floating thru the night 
While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender
A fool was I but how was I to know
I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go 
Like snowhite clouds floating through the night 
Speaking of a love that was heavenly 
A love that could never be mine
 
Once we were together and now we're apart
Did you find it easy to forget?
I keep on dreaming while the years go drifting by
Calling you my ""Sweet Regret""

They possess a gift or two
One of them is this

And where will you be tonight when I cry?
Will sleep for you come easy,
Though I alone can't slumber
Will you welcome in the morning
At another man's side?

How easy for you the years slipped under
And left me a shadow the sun can't dispel
I built for you a tower of love and admiration
But I set you so high I could not reach myself.

I look through my window at a world filled with strangers
The face in my mirror is the one face I know
You have taken all that's in me, so my heart is in no danger
My heart is in no danger, but I'd still like to know

If there is a silence then it can be broken
If there beats a pure heart to her I will go
And time will work its healing and the spirit will grow stronger
Ah, but in the meantime I'd still like to know.

These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Andy Martin,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You {From Music in the Air}
Andy McGaw,"At first I did not think it could be you.
But you're the only one that got off the train.
So you must be my wife Miss Annie Halsey
Yes, I guess I am your husband, Hello I'm Harry Crane.
Mail Order Annie, never mind your crying.
Your tears are sweet rain in my empty life.
Mail Order Annie, can't you see I'm trying
To tell you that I'm glad you're here,
You are the woman who's come to be my wife.
You know you're not as pretty as I dreamed you'd be,
But then I'm not no handsome fancy Dan.
And out here looks are really not important.
It's what's inside a woman when she's up against the land.
Mail Order Annie, never mind your crying.
Your tears are sweet rain in my empty life.
Mail Order Annie, can't you see I'm trying
To tell you that I'm glad you're here,
You are the woman who's come to be my wife.
You know it's not no easy life you're entering.
The winter wind comes whistling through the cracks there in the sod.
You know you'll never have too many neighbors.
There's you Girl, and there's me, and there's God.
You know I'm just a dirty man from the North Dakota plains.
You're one girl from the city who's been thrown out on her own.
I'm standing here not sure of what to say to you
'Cepting Mail Order Annie, lets you and me go home. 
Mail Order Annie, never mind your crying.
Your tears are sweet rain in my empty life.
Mail Order Annie, can't you see I'm trying
To tell you that I'm glad you're here,
You are the woman who's come to be my wife.",Mail Order Annie
Andy McKee,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

Where my faith will be sight

What's the point of getting fly
You ain't ready for the flight

Dudes find bravado from the bottom of the bottle

Until they got the face twisted up like Picasso there's another way to live

I just won't remain low
So that that I don't take it to the brain, brain
Catch me underground on a train ridin' slow
That's where I compose
All my wickedest flows
Being from New York
Or wicked at its pros
And these con Edison bills high like they smoking

Some are up town
It's like an expo
Like some exposed skin
Like a triple x show
Me and my dawgs flee
We don't need to bend though
But my flesh be itching

Andy Mineo,"You know there's one single to root right? Hebrews 12:15 check it out
You know there's a few things in my life that cause me to be bitter and, I'm just asking God, I'm like

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, so take it all away

Anybody know the feeling of rejection?
Feels like you was kicked in your midsection,
When you feel like you simply just lost your best friend,
Everybody play the game of love you [?],
You start thinking she's chillin' with other men, and you gettin' jealous, start beefing, and harboring harsh resentment,
I'm asking Jesus to keep me from being bitter, go skeeming on twitter, get mad and post it on my statuses,
Bitterness can make a heart numb,
But hope is like a star you don't see it shine bright until the dark come,
So don't just scoop the dust, remove the rug,
If I got unforgiveness in my heart, then there really ain't no room for love,
Plus it's stupid cause, I've been so forgiven,
That if I hold a grudge, I don't show He's risen,
But I know my sins removed since Jesus came,
With no reason to forgive me but He did so I do the same

Ugh

Sometimes things just happen in life that don't make any sense, but, bitterness is a choice

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, so take it all away

Yeah, I gotta tread softly,
Don't wanna be a hypocrite plus I got some bitterness I wanna get up off me,
Where should I start, well I feel like I'd be sorta frontin',
To say that when my father calls that I don't hit ignore button,
It's probably cause we never kicked it at a younger age,
I know when he's calling but I don't have got his number saved,
I keep dodging him but I'm just being honest,
All he wanna do is talk football and how I should play in college,
I get bitter, kinda cold like the winter,
It's so hard for me to forgive him then I remember that I'm a sinner,
And Jesus forgave me and washed away my sins,
When I didn't deserve it then I could forgive him,
His power in such amazing love like when Jesus forgave the ones that pinned him up on that cross as he was hanging from it,
Holy Spirit, teach me to be just like the Son,
Remove the roots of bitterness don't stop until your work is done

God I don't wanna be bitter, teach me to forgive, let me see my own sin

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, so take it all away

Bitter, bitter, bitter

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, so take it all away",Bitter
Andy Mineo,"[Chorus]
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
And the colors seem
A burning tree speaking to me,
I'm caught dreaming.

Why waste my breath singing words of praise
That are filled with myself? Who's greater?
What love do I have that you didn't give
'Cause all that I am is a product of grace.
And what should I trust, your love for me
Or my love for you? Who's greater?

[Chorus]
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
And the colors seem
A burning tree speaking to me,
I'm caught dreaming,
Someone greater than me
Bringing liberty
The burning tree is saving me,
I'm caught dreaming.

Yeah, mouth full of praise, I love you so much
What an empty phrase, really I'm more amazed
How in spite of how I fail to do what you command to
Serve other gods like Baal, you never bail,
That's illogical devotion, could it really be
You chose to die for the sinner when nothing was good in me.
You never left me, even when the darkest days began
Nor forget me, only thing you're forgetting is my sin.
I wanna make it to the end, let me remain faithful,
All because you're faithful in me, yeah, I'm grateful.
My mistakes can never stop me, choice you make to adopt me,
The holes in your hands are the proof that you'll never drop me.

[Chorus]
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
And the colors seem
A burning tree speaking to me,
I'm caught dreaming,
Someone greater than me
Bringing liberty
The burning tree is saving me,
I'm caught dreaming.

I could sing how I love you, love you,
But your love for me is much greater.
And I could sing how I love you, love you,
But your love for me is much greater.

[Chorus]
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
And the colors seem
A burning tree speaking to me,
I'm caught dreaming,
Someone greater than me
Bringing liberty
The burning tree is saving me,
I'm caught dreaming.",Caught Dreaming
Andy Mineo,"Is it corny if I admit
That i check up on you from time to time when I'm on the net
I promise I ain't no stalker it's so awkward
When i actually come across you I act like I ain't bothered a bit
And you know what that is and I know too
That's pride mixed with lies mixed with I want you's
Kinda maybe sorta or the order could be off
Often I wonder if I regret what I lost
At a later time could my state of mind make me blind
I pray it isn't if it was I wouldn't admit it
I thought that I was heading in the right direction
But maybe loneliness has got me second guessing
I got some fly women they follow me on twitter
I think I'll DM'em alright I'm trippin'
But I'm hard wired for intimecy
So why does my loneliness lead to compromise

Is it weird it's been a few years
We celebrated the ball droppin' together (cheers)
The stuff you used to wear different products in your hair
When I smell'em in the air I feel like you're somewhere near
Is it me is it you was it lie was it truth
Maybe it's just nobody's ever good enough for you
Ok I swear I'm going through asked my homie what to do
He said boy listen here cause I'm finna tell the truth
Everybody think about they ex's
Even if you got kids man we two your best friend
In them memories are easily made but hard to forget
Cause they ex'ed up in your heart the good times and regrets
It's curiosity get you in trouble
Specially if it's forbidden kind that you run to
Ah man yeah you're more sensitive then you'll ever admit
So be careful who you make memories with
The secret is to learn what it means to be content
And celebrate what God's given not the things He didn't
Our heart is always longing for more and it wanna bug out
That's why we gotta drink from that water that never run out
But sometimes
I'm still curious",Curious
Andy Mineo,"It was just last week that my grandma died
It's been years since I've seen family on my fathers side
A bitter sweet, moment but tell me why
Nothing less then the sting of death brought us together
I sat and listened to the priest tell lies
To appease loved ones in their seats
When you looking at a face that's weaping
The grim truth wont bring'em no peace
So I put on, all white gloves like Mr. Jackson
Carried the casket to the Cadillac then
I realised this is the first time that me and my brothers ever did something together
Whatever, I'm grown now come on let's just put on the smiles
And take pictures, take pictures
Uh
Eat this humble pie then leave them dishes
For somebody else to clean 'em until I see ya'll again

(Breakin' down, breakin' down)
Everything here is breaking down
(Br-br-Breakin' down, breakin' down)
It's all breaking down down down
(Breakin' down, breakin' down)
Everything here is breaking down
(Breakin' down, breakin' down)
But this wont be forever no

You used to make me cry
But one day He'll wipe every tear from our eyes
He'll come make all things right
And we'll sing death has died

But until that day
Until that day
Oh, until that day
Oh, oh, oh
This won't be forever
Until that day
Oh, until that day
Oh, oh, oh,
This won't be for ever

I hopped off the plane
My God, what a scene that I seen on that TV screen
People huddled round, hands on they mouth
Not again, same problem, it hit a new town
26 dead, 20 of 'em kids
Where do you begin when some lives just ended?
And everybody got the question:
If God's so good how He let this happen?
Is it mental health? Is it gun control?
Is it we make superstars out of animals?
Is it the movies we make? The video games?
I dunno, but God I want an antidote
All I know is this world is broken
Our sin is the reason it ain't like it's supposed to
Words fall short tryna comfort the grieving
But you gotta know that there's hope to believe in
One day my God gon' crack the sky
He gon' bottle up every tear that we ever cried
Bring truth to every lie, justice for ever crime
All our shame will be gone and we'll never have to hide
No more broken hearts, no more broken homes
No more lockin' doors, no more cops patrollin'
No abusive words, or abusive touches
No more cancerous cells that'll take our loved ones
No more hungry kids, no more natual disaster
No child will ever have to ask where his dad is
No funerals where we wear all black
And death will be dead and we'll lock the casket
Yes!

You used to make me cry (you used to make me cry)
But one day He'll wipe every tear from our eyes (every tear from our eyes)
He'll come make all things right (all things right)
And we'll sing death has died
But until that day
You used to make me cry (you used to make me cry)
But one day He'll wipe every tear from our eyes (every tear from our eyes)
He'll come make all things right

Andy Mineo,"Come you sinners poor and needy,
Weak and wounded, sick and sore,
Jesus ready stands to save you,
Grace requires nothing more,
I will arise and go to Jesus,
He will embrace me in His arms,
In the arms of my dear Savior,
There are ten thousands charms,

Why is it every time I step up on a train, 
I see a pretty dame and I wonder what her name is,
For' I even get there the question on my brain is,
Do you love the Lord do you live to make Him famous?
Then the cart stop, she step off, it's time to refocus,
I'm questioning my heart, examining my motives,
Why I'm captivated by the brown skin mocha divas,
And I hope in my mind she's a believer,
Ok, she got all that beauty yea it's obvious, 
I can't let it take precedence over Godliness,
Now I'm getting restless, 
How I'm recognizing when I'm choosing to take pleasure in all these false treasures,
They fools gold,
Instead of looking for them sundresses,
I should be looking for the Son I confess it,
Even though my prides telling me don't let the fans know,
I am not a superhuman though,
I am a man,
So the grace that I talk about on all my records,
I need it for myself, cause really I'm just a mess,
Finding rest from the pressures of perfection,
As I stand up on this platform they expectin,
Me to be a man without flaws, that's false,
I am just another rapper that's called to point ya'll to the cross,
And that's exactly where I'm headed,
I'm just another beggar pointin ya'll to where the bread is,
Maaan..

I'm not a superhuman
I am just a man,
No, I'm not a superhuman,
I am just a man,
I'm not a superhuman,
I am just a man, but they never understand,

I'm nothing more than a man lost, dead in my sin,
So here I am alive in Your hands, 
Your hands, Your hands

We dress up in nice heels, we try to make people buy'em,
That's why when someone ask how we doin, we tell'em fine,
Knowing we hurt inside, but tell me who's really lyin,
They ain't really wanna know how you doin, that cost time,
That's way too expensive,
And if I ever get a date with a dime I'm sending my representative,
The version of Andy that's cropped and edited,
I'm killin this first impression, and I'm hidin the evidence,
Yea, photoshoppin the blemishes,
These lies of perfection are the cry of the desperate,
Men that want that acceptance,
Holdin they breath, dyin a thousand deaths,
Forgettin there's beauty inside the mess,
What else could you expect? we obsessed over twitter numbers,
Checkin ours, then comparing them to others, like,
The number of likes upon a status is somehow suppose to raise our status,
Boy, this is madness,
We want the trophy wife who's the baddest and not some average,
So we can feel like the man, Randy Savage,
Take me off the shelf, I don't wanna be for retail,
I would rather be real, let you see the details,
When we fell, it feels like we fall so far cause they put us so high,
I am not a star,
I'm just a product of grace that's still in the process,
And I don't gotta be great, because my God is,

And I don't gotta be great, because my God is,
I'm just a product of grace and guess what?
I'm still in the process, there's unfinished business

Would you love me if I told you I couldn't fly?
I got no cape on and no mask on there's no disguise,
Oh I'm no hero
There's only one,
Oh I'm no hero,
There's only one, 
And He's not for sale,

I'm not a superhuman
I am just a man,
No, I'm not a superhuman,
I am just a man,
I'm not a superhuman,
I am just a man, but they never understand,

I'm nothing more than a man lost, dead in my sin,
So here I am alive in Your hands,

My sinning cost a grip
But Jesus paid the bill
You don't believe in miracles
I show you why they real
Some rappers don't got skill
But somehow they got a deal.
Weird
I'm riding around in this airport
Flying around on my skateboard
And my glasses on like a straight dork
Oh your money talk but he's yay short
I love the haters so I pray for em
See them hearts we aim for em
So I tell the world that we stay touring
And we do it our way, we won't change for em
This ain't no fast food (Nope, nope)
You can't order us
They looking so confused (Heh)
What's the formula?
We just really want more of God
Na we don't really want more of us
'Cause He did it we giving Him thanks
Even when they ain't awarding us
And them strip clubs money drugs
C'mon 'cause you boring us
We heard it all before
And I'm still unimpressed with that sort of stuff
We were made for more though
With them award shows and you thank Christ
That lip service don't mean nothing
If you ain't about that life

Y-O-U
Owe me nothing
No nothing

Y-O-U
Owe me nothing
No nothing

I know you will, I know you will
I know you will, I know you will
I know you will, I know you will

I know you will
Even when they say you won't
I know you will

I know you will
I know you will
Even when they say you can't
I know you will

No there's nothing you can't do
Nothing in this world too big for you

So when they say you can't
I know you will
I know you will
Even when they say you can't

Everything change when ya go from seeing it all
Big screen to behind the scenes
Leading us on like this the life they lead
You know the rich and famous, kill theyself to stay rich and famous
Very same thing they they built they name with
Be the same thing they they be enslaved with
So, I don't want rap you can have that
I don't want the crown yo I'm aiming past that
Heading for another thrown can't have that
It's a Kingdom where my Dads at
And I'm his son I sing ? and
I'm in some so death won't have that last laugh
Huh, child of a King, royalty
That's ascap
They want glory, money, and power before you go
I promise you it's empty we aiming just way too low
I know we own things we don't need to impress people we don't know
Then we go broke trying to look rich
I can't do it, I just won't

Throw my faith in rap, but they say don't say that huh?

Well, if I listen to you, and everything you put in my ear
I'll be living like woulda, shoulda, coulda, I'll be paralyzed by fear

You ain't have my back even when I had yours
We said we'll take the whole world over
You couldn't even tell me what's wrong
Still think about it though it's been so long
Thought we'd be down forever, now you're gone

I remember, I remember
It wasn't many days that we didn't chill together
We was hangin' in my dorm room, we would write them rhymes
Then record 'em in my closet cause we was next to shine
Even had our own handshake, fall into that hug
And we was different colors, but we swore that we were blood
And, uh, all of a sudden you deaded everyone
I had to find out through the internet you had a son
And when I text you won't hit me
This music took me all around the world, you were s'posed to go with me
But, uh, the thug changes and love changes
And them best friends become strangers
I knew what Nas said was true
I just never thought it be about you
But, um, people come, people go
And when they leave it's like they took a piece of your soul
It's sorta like a ghost

I didn't know you could walk through walls
I didn't know you could float
I didn't know you could disappear
I guess you were a ghost
Ghost
Ghost
We used to be so close

I pray I don't get used to this feelin'
The closer you are, deeper the cuts, longer the healin'
These feelings and insecurity, they circle
I just walk around like ain't a soul on this earth that's hurtin' me
I do this for protection
When I feel rejected I just dead 'em first, man
Somebody bring the hearse in
My worst fear in life is that my wife would have the urge to leave
Like everybody else start desertin' me
I know we made vows, but I cannot believe when I see divorce rates
You know why I got doubts
Fear takin' control
Seein' it, now I know
To truly love a person, the bravest act of the soul
I could either get my heart again, put it in the open
Or lock it in a box where it never be broken
But there it grows cold, lifeless and old
Nobody could come close but it's safe
Protected from the ghost

I didn't know you could walk through walls
I didn't know you could float
I didn't know you could disappear
I guess you were a ghost

Then I believed that a brawl would never come between my dawgs, wrong

Told me Hulk Hogan only existed on television (what?)
The Stone Cold Stunner and the Leg Drop, all scripted?
N.W.O. and X-Pac?

I used to walk up to them automatic doors
My momma told me that my finger was the power source
So I pointed with my pointer, then, pow! It was open, then come to find out she was jokin'
Had to let it soak in, my mind as a boy didn't wanna believe that McGwire or Barry were on the 'roids

It's funny, I even thought that Jesus was white, but yo

Now I know better, it's better late than never
Now I know

Over the years, you get more accustomed to pain
Used to believe my dad when he said he'd come to my games
Even believed my mother was a saint and could do no wrong
And then she sat me down and told me how I was born (shoot)
Mind blown, but now it all makes sense
Why she didn't spazz on me when she caught me havin' sex
I was perplexed but now I get it
I used to think America was finished with racism, how could I miss it?
I'm mad so many people don't get it
Holdin' this list of black names, but now I'm blacklisted?
Got older, it's like it got no different
I found out that these independent artists isn't independent
Cause major labels fund them quietly to keep perception
That's deception in the game, used to believe I wanted fame
Plus my name written in them lights, now I know it's so much greater cause it's written in the hand of Christ
Then, I, I used to say the radio would play what the people wanted
Now I know they playin' what's payin'

Corrupted by the comfort we (love, love)

God prepare me for the war
Comfort be the thing that'll make a king fall
Eyes on the Lord, gotta grip that blade of the sword
Tell me how you plan on gettin' swole if you don't ever get sore (hold up)
They say, Andy, this ain't music for your car
If they jumpin' ship now, they was never on board
I got enemies, man they wanna see me on the floor
I got frenemies, couldn't even tell you who they are
If you're not driven by the mission, you'll be driven by the cars
Focused on what you been gettin' more than becomin' who you are
I tried to point 'em to the Sun, but why they callin' me a star?
Who woulda thought we set they minds free with these bars?
In this game, in this biz
Want the fame, want get rich
Comfort, everybody wantin' it
Never knew I could be lost in this
This my sophomore, gotta go hard
When the show over, no encore
I got enough but I want more, want more!

If we still believe our present ain't affected by our past
First class with a Coach bag, I forgot
When you start eatin' you lose your hunger then grow fat
I apologize for Christians with pickets sayin', 'God hates fags'
I promise Jesus wouldn't act like that
He said it's hard for a rich man to get to heaven
When we feel like we don't need God, then we forget Him
We tell 'em that, if you don't make me money or make me happy
Then I ain't makin' time for ya', so make it snappy
And I think lately you mistake me for a cabby
'Cause this drive that I got put everybody in the backseat
So if you wanna live a comfortable life
Make sure you never love nobody, be selfish and never sacrifice

We got legal weed that'll keep us high
'Round the world other people die
Where on earth is my wi-fi?

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end

I had to fall
To lose it all

Pushed as far as I can go

There's only one thing you should know

Did you make disease, and the diamond blue? 
Did you make mankind after we made you? 
And the devil too!

Dear god,
Dont know if you noticed,
But your name is on a lot of quotes in this book.
Us crazy humans wrote it, you should take a look,
And all the people that you made in your image,
Still believing that junk is true.
Well I know it aint and so do you,
Dear god,
I cant believe in,
I dont believe in,

I wont believe in heaven and hell.
No saints, no sinners,
No devil as well.
No pearly gates, no thorny crown.
Youre always letting us humans down.
The wars you bring, the babes you drown.
Those lost at sea and never found,
And its the same the whole world round.
The hurt I see helps to compound,
That the father, son and holy ghost,
Is just somebodys unholy hoax,
And if youre up there youll perceive,
That my hearts here upon my sleeve.
If theres one thing I dont believe in...

Its you,
Dear god.",Dear God [Skiffle Version]

Me and the wind are feeling freer than air should ever be 
Should ever be should ever be should ever 

And when you lured me into your syrup 
All I could think of was what a lovely way for me to go 
I never really realised that 

Just like the struggling summer flies that 
I was drowning no matter how sweet or how slow 

Have I been such a fool 
Have I been sitting on your stool 
While you cracked the whip 
While you cracked the whip 

I danced imprisoned in your drumbeat 
Your tune of spring had me whirling like a mad march 
Merry hare 
It never really came to mind that 

The strings of your instrument were strangling me 
Inside their snare 

Have I been such a fool 
Have I been sitting on your stool 
While you held the hoop 
While you held the hoop 

Now that I'm out and I'm shouting in doorways 
Freed from a love more like murder 
I should be singing but in liberation 
Feel like a ship with no rudder

From caves of memory 
I saw the children at heart 
That we once used to be 
Borne on foaming seahorse herd 
Compose with trumpeting shell 
From lines across their hands

As old as all the sands 
Shrank to stagnant from Atlantic wild 
Lost that child 'til mermaid 
Smiled 

Summoned by drum rolling surf 
As laughing fish compel 
The young boy woken in me 
By clanging diving bell 
Breakers pillow fight the shore 
She wriggles free in the tide

Back in the mirror she slides 
Waving with comb in hand

To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left

Went down that Georgia line
The engine passed at six o'clock
And the cab passed by at nine

Where the sun never shines
And we shiver when the cold wind blows
Who who hoo hoo hoo, who who hoo hoo hoo

I asked my captain for the time of day
He said he throwed his watch away
A long steel rail and a short cross tie
I'm on my way back home

In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
And we shiver when the cold wind blows
Who who hoo hoo hoo, who who hoo hoo hoo

Little girl, little girl, what have I done
That makes you treat me so?
You caused me to weep, you caused me to mourn
You caused me to leave my home

But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Andy Scott,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One & Only Love

Should I keep dreaming on, or just forget you?

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore

The orange one,

We'd walk by his house.
In the front,
Not by the lane.

My lovers voice turned rivers wide

Flow me to her heart
I want to listen from where it starts
If I dive too deep
I pray to God my soul to keep
She can sing a symphony
Like a three note melody

So hush, be still, crowd
And watch me fall to heaven
And she will sing so loud
And take us all to heaven

If you say you heard it all
I would burn the music halls
I can say I'll wait for years
To hear her son with deafening ears

She can sing a symphony
Like a three note melody

So hush, be still, crowd
And watch me fall to heaven
And she will sing so loud
And take us all to heaven

Hush, be still, crowd
And watch me fall to heaven
And she will sing so loud
And take us all to heaven

Andy Tongren,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You

I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

That you see turns your head

And it scares me that tomorrow
Someone else may take my place

Tonight there will be no morning star
Tonight, tonight, I'll see my love tonight.
And for us, stars will stop where they are. 

Today the minutes seem like hours, 
The hours go so slowly, 
And still the sky is light 

Oh moon, grow bright, 
And make this endless day endless night!

A place for me to live in
No better than alright

Andy Williams,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You
Andy Williams,"Falling in love with love is falling for make believe
Falling in love with love is playing the fool
Caring too much is such a juvenile fancy
Learning to trust is just for children in school

I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes unable to see
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting
But love fell out with me

 There is sunshine everywhere
 There are people greeting people
 And a feeling of Spring in the air

May you make friends with each one you meet
And may all of your daydreams be mem'ries
And may all of your mem'ries be sweet

The weeks turn to months and the months into years
There'll be sadness and joy, there'll be laughter and tears
But one thing I pray to heaven above
May each of your days be a day full of love

May each day in the year be a good day
May each dawn find you happy and gay
And may all of your days be as lovely
As the one you shared with me today

May each day of your life be a good day
And good night.

As he walked away

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end

But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now

And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will

It was foaming like a wave
On the ground around your knees

For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me

And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life, you'll still be the one

I will win the worship in their eyes oh and I will lose it

To watch the way she smiled.
I guess I just felt free with her,
So free and young and wild.

How much she'll never know.
I need the nearness of that girl;
I really miss her so.

Andy Williams,"To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go.

To right the unrightable wrong
To be better far than you are
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star

This is my quest, to follow that star,
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
To be willing to give when there's no more to give
To be willing to die so that honor and justice may live

And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm when I'm laid to my rest

And the world will be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star.",The Impossible Dream (The Quest)

I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but baby can't you see (baby can't you see now)
There's no one more important to me (baby)
Baby can't you please see through me
'cause we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you

Andy Williams,"It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old

From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heaven's all gracious king

The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing



Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl

And still their heavenly music floats, O'er all the weary world.

Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing

And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing



O ye, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low

Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow

Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing

O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing



For lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old

When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold

When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their King

And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing

Who will her lover be?

Before the night is old
My arms will hold Kalua
And where the trandewinds blow
Soft and low

Our love will blossom bright
In the night
And stars will sing above

Andy Williams,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening

Where skies of blue are calling me
Where balmy air and golden moonlight
Caress the waving palms of Wai KiKi

Valleys with their rainbows
Your mountains green, and deep blue sea
Your fragrant flowers and dreamy music
Unite and sing a aloha-hi to me

Andy Williams,"I've traveled far
The land and the sea
Beautiful places
I happened to be

One little town
I'll never forget
Is Lourdes
The village of St. Bernadette

Ave, ave, ave, Maria
Ave, ave, ave, Maria

There, like a dream
This wonderful night
I gazed at the grotto
Aglow in the light

A feeling divine
Swept over me there
I fell to my knees
As I whispered the prayer

Ave, ave, ave, Maria
Ave, ave, ave, Maria

Now I am home
I'm happy to be
Telling of places
I've traveled to see

Andy Williams,"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now, I see

T'was Grace that taught
My heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come.
T'was Grace that brought us safe thus far
And Grace will lead us home.

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.

When we've been here ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Then when we've first begun.
