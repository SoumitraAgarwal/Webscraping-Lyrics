Ronnie Bedford,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends
Ronnie Bedford,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
On Green Dolphin Street
",On Green Dolphin Street
Ronnie Bowman,"Staring out the window at the sinking sun
Another painful day is done
If I could convince myself I was over you now
I'd find a way to go on somehow

But the pain just grows stronger everyday
I think of you and I'm on my way
Down memory lane with your hand in mine
Guess, I'm just not the healing kind

Another December and the cold winds blow
And nights without you are so long
I stare at our picture through the firelight's glow
And where you are right now I just don't know

And the pain just grows stronger everyday
I think of you and I'm on my way
Down memory lane with your hand in mine
Guess, I'm just not the healing kind
Yes, I'm just not the healing kind

",The Healing Kind
Ronnie Brown,"If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends

If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look

Ronnie Brown,"I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt claps of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still",My Heart Stood Still
Ronnie Brown,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

When if ever, will my lips know

Ronnie Brown,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all my heart could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love",You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To
Ronnie Carroll,"Please teacher, teach me something,
Nice teacher, teach me something.
I'm as awkward as a camel, that's not the worst,
My two feet haven't met yet,
But I'll be teacher's pet yet,
'Cause I'm gonna learn to dance or burst.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,

Ronnie Carroll,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Ronnie Cuber,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight

Ronnie Cuber,"Sophisticated lady tryin' to change my ways
Just because you're caught in your social maze
I think it's 'bout time that you realize
Your money and your power's got you mesmerized

Ronnie Cuber,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Ronnie Cuber,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me"
Ronnie Cuber,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss
Ronnie Cuber,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Ronnie Cuber,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low

Ronnie Dawson,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Ronnie Day,"She calls him early cause she knows he'll be asleep
She leaves a message after the beep
She says she's better now but she's still incomplete
She's tryin' hard to make her voice sound soft and sweet
(Yeah)

A couple hours pass 'till he picks up the phone
He wasn't ready for the shock he holds his breath down
He plays the message twice and then the dial tone
Reminds him that she's not around its a lonely sound

He's got perspective and she's got nothing left and he wonders why he can’t go on
He's singin'
Would she, could she've been think of me all along?
And if I asked her would she tell me the truth?
'Cause it's a long way down when your hopes are high as mountains
And I am worried that I'm fallin' for you

She's like an hour glass that never got the sand
She's hollow and transparent like an infant

In the album of my memory

And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye

Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

Ronnie Dunn,"Let's say were sorry,
Before it's too late,
Give forgiveness a chance
Turn the anger into water
Let it slip through our hands

We all bleed red,
We all taste rain,
All fall down,
Lose our way,
We all say words we regret,
We all cry tears, we all bleed red

If we're fighting, we're both losing,
We're just wasting our time
Because my scars,
They are your scars and your world is mine

You and I, we all bleed red,
We all taste rain, all fall down, lose our way
We all say words, we regret,
We all cry tears, we all bleed red

Sometimes we're strong, sometimes we're weak,
Sometimes we're hurt and it cuts deep
We live this life, breath to breath,
We're all the same, we all bleed red

Let's say we're sorry' before its too late

We all bleed red,
All taste rain, all fall down, lose our way
We all say words, we regret,

Ronnie Dunn,"Everythin' to know about me
Is written on this page
A number you can reach me
My social and my age

Yes, I served in the army
It's where I learned to shoot
Eighteen months in the desert
Pourin' sand out of my boots

No, I've never been convicted of a crime
I could start this job at any time

I got a strong back, steel toes
I rarely call in sick, a good truck
What I don't know I catch on real quick
I work weekends, if I have to, nights and holidays

Give you forty and then some
Whatever it takes
Three dollars and change at the pump
The cost of livin's high and goin' up

I put Robert down as a reference
He's known me all my life
We attend the same church
He introduced me to my wife

I gave my last job everythin'
Before it headed south
Took the shoes off of my children's feet
Food out of their mouths
Yesterday my folks offered to help
But they're barely gettin' by themselves

I got a strong back, steel toes
I rarely call in sick, a good truck
What I don't know I catch on real quick
I work weekends, if I have to, nights and holidays

Give you forty and then some
Whatever it takes
Four dollars and change at the pump
The cost of livin's high and goin' up

I'm sure a hundred others have applied
Rumor has it you're only takin' five

I got a strong back, steel toes
I'm handy with a wrench
There's nothin' I can't drive
Nothin' I can't fix

I work sunup to sundown
Ain't too proud to sweep the floors
The bank has started callin'
And the wolves are at my door

Talking to himself, putting up a fight

Stole a sip o' my beer
I didn't mind, you were so fine
Ended up in these arms of mine

Who cares if we never go back
When you kiss me like that, still feels like Mexico

No Mariachi band that's right

Put those pretty lips on mine
Cross that border one more time

That it makes a fiery ring

Just as fickle as a feather in a stream
See, honey, I saw love, you see, it came to me
It put its face up to my face so I could see
Yeah then I saw love disfigure me
Into something I am not recognizing

See, the cage, it called, I said, come on in
I will not open myself up this way again
Nor lay my face to the soil, nor my teeth to the sand
I will not lay like this for days now upon end
You will not see me fall, nor see me struggle to stand
To be acknowledge by some touch from his gnarled hands
You see, the cage, it called, I said, come on in
I will not open myself up this way again

You see, the moon is bright in that treetop night
I see the shadows that we cast in the cold, clean light
My feet are gold, my heart is white
And we race out on the desert plains all night
See, honey, I am not some broken thing
I do not lay here in the dark waiting for thee
No my heart is gold, my feet are light
And I am racing out on the desert plains all night

So some say love is a burning thing
That it makes a fiery ring
Oh but I know love as a caging thing
Just a killer come to call from some awful dream

You just stand there in the glass looking at me
But my heart is wild, and my bones are steam
And I could kill you with my bare hands if I was free",Song For Zula

A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms

A girl

With a love, oh, so true
And the hand that I can hold
To feel you near as I grow old

My own

Someday, I don't know how
I hope she'll hear my plea
Some way, I don't know how
She'll bring her love to me

I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till all my lover's dreams come true

Ronnie Hawkins,"There's a place where lovers go to cry their troubles away
And they call it lonesome town, where the broken hearts stay
You can buy a dream or two to last you all through the years
And the only price you pay is a heartful of tears
 
Goin' down to lonesome town, where the broken hearts stay
Goin' down to lonesome town to cry my troubles away
In the town of broken hearts the streets are paved with regret
Maybe down in lonesome town I can learn to forget

That you've been seen, a-runnin' round 
I know that I should leave but then 
I just can't go, you win again 

This heart of mine could never see 
What everybody knew but me 
Just trusting you was my great sin 
What can I do, you win again 

I'm sorry for your victim now
'Cause soon his head like mine will bow 
You'll use his heart, but all in vain 
And someday say, you win again 

You have no heart, you have no shame 
You take true love and give the blame 
I guess that I should not complain 
I love you still, you win again",You Win Again

Awkward little girl I knew 
Oh no, overnight there's been a breathless 
Change in you! 

Gigi, why you were tremblin' on the brink 
Was I out yonder somewhere blinkin' at a star? 
Oh Gigi, have I been standin' up to close 
Or back too far? 

When did your sparkle turn to fire 
And your warmth become desire? 
Oh, what miracle 
Has made you the way you are?

Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day

One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new

Down the street before,
But the pavement always
Stayed beneath my feet before.

Knowing I?m on the street where you live.

Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live.

Why is it wrong to be
Young and foolish
We haven't long to be

Soon enough the carefree days
The sunlit days go by
Soon enough the bluebird has to fly

We were foolish
One day we fell in love
Now we wonder
What were we dreaming of

Smiling in the sunlight
Laughing in the rain
I wish that we were

Ronnie Hudson,"Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

I got a hoe named Real de Real
She got a buddy named SP 12, now, you know the deal
We getz freaky in the studio late night
That's why the beats that you hear are comin' real tight

Somethin' to roll to, somethin' to stroll to
If you's a playa in the game this will hold you
Mo money mo money for the bank roll
Stick to the script don't slip in the nine-fo

A lot of fools put salt in the game
Till when these women get the notion that they runnin' the game, huh
I run my own and I'm my own self person
No respect make the situation worse then

Fillmoe, H.P. and Sunnydale, there's a playaz club everywhere you dwell
Lakeview, P.H. and Army Street, a different part of town
A different kind of freak, I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
And press play on the remote at the Playaz Club

Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

More champagne, Mr. 4-Tay?

From day one, I had to get my money right
Me, Fly and Franky J we took a airplane flight, huh
They wanted to hear a rap, I said alright bet
We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote a check

A few G's for the pocket no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
The word was gettin' out 4-Tay's out rappable

Don't need a Glock but I bought one just in case
Suckas try to stop me from pursuin' my paper chase
'cause the chase is on because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap you make the Glock pop

So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way just in case you never heard
Rappin' 4-Tay, I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin' off them suckas poppin' off at the lip

I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank, bro
Leave the gat at the house bring some Dominoes
Take off your shoes relax and get a body rub
And shoot your mackin' at these women at the Playaz Club

Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

You can't resist it but don't get it twisted
V.I.P. that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout and how you carry yourself
Now, homie what you all about?

I stack paper and kick it with the O.G's
Some got a nine-to-five, some drink a lot of keys
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
A lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme sayer

A lot of people get a misconception
And start driftin' in the wrong direction
Miss Goody Two Shoes, see you later
I ain't got time you ain't nuthin' but a playa hater

I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show another flow a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts

So get your membership but never slip to lame fast
Or else us and fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the Playaz Club

Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

Me and my homies, we tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
'cause we kick much ass at the Sucka Free club

Yeah, I'd like to send this shout out
To all the Playaz Clubs throughout the world
I know they got a Playaz Club out there in Chicago
What about that one they got out there in Philly, Fo?

You know they got one out there in Atlanta, the way they by choppin'
Shit, Detroit, New York, Texas
Yeah, but we gonna move on down to these
Playaz Clubs close to home like Seattle, L.A., Bakersfield, San Diego

P.A., V-Town, Richmond, Sacramento
Yeah, but a special shot goes out to the
Playaz Club right across the water in the Biggity Biggity O
Yeah, and last but definitely not least yeah, them

Ronnie Jay Wheeler,"When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn


And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am",Paradise
Ronnie Jay Wheeler,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.

I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.

Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.

all that's left is an unhappy ending.

Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.

Still live in my heart all alone

Ronnie Kole,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Ronnie Kole,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Ronnie Kole,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

But when you feel, oh, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
And there are times when I fall short of what I say
what I say I'm all about, all about

Tell me what it is (Tell me what it is)
Make believe, no need to make believe
Look beyond your own (Look beyond your own)
Try and find another place for me

Ronnie Magri,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no,

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere

I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude

Send back my love

Ronnie Mason,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew

From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes

That she brings me water.
And I dream in the evening
That she brings me wine.

There's a great hot desert
Down in Mexicali.
And if you don't have water
Boy, you'd better not go.

Is drivin' me insane.

To try and find a way
To reach that woman
In old Mexico.

And I met a kind man
He guarded the border
He said, ""You don't need papers,
I'll let you go,
I can tell that you love her
By the look in your eyes, now"".
She's the rose of the desert
In old Mexico

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard;
Everybody wants her, everybody loves her; 
Everybody wants to take your baby home;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;
You, know that it's crazy and you wanna trust her; 
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone;
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
Maybe it's just an ego problem; 
Problem is that I've been fooled before;
by fairweather friends and faint hearted lovers;
And every time it happens, it just convinces me more; 
 
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies;

everybody tells her she's the most beautiful woman they know;

Writer Geoffrey Morgan

It's not over when you stop crying and it's the end when you say goodbye
And it's not finally done when you just walk away from someone
Cause love takes a long time it takes such a long time to die
There'll be times when you're alone you'll softly speak her name
Each one's just about left you one time
Daydreaming through the glass you'll see pictures from the past
Cause love takes a long time it takes such a long time to die
It's so hard to shut the door when mem'ries won't stay behind
They'll come around to remind you there's love still locked inside
So it's not over when you stop crying...

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Ronnie Milsap,"I GOT HOME JUST IN TIME TO SAY GOODBYE
Writers Wayne Kemp - Bill Emerson

I woke up a thousand miles from home this morning
Sweaten from a bad dream that I had
I rode all night to get back home to you
I can't remember when I needed you this bad
And I got home just in time to see you leaving
And you walked out just in time to see me cry
What my eyes are seeing now I'm not believing
Cause I got home just in time to say goodbye
There he was standing right next to our roses
A half way between the door and the gate
I walk through that man just like I didn't know him
Cause after all a loser don't have much to say
And I got home just in time to see you leaving...
Cause I got home just in time to say goodbye



",I Got Home Just in Time to Say Goodbye
Ronnie Milsap,"LOOKING OUT MY WINDOW THROUGH THE PAIN
Writer John Schweers

I watched from the window as she slipped from the house
Once again she's leaving but Lord she's not to blame
This morning a mem'ry phoned her and he's a habit she can't break
So till she returns I'll wait for her looking out my window through the pain
The devil drove the taxi that carried her away
And it hurts to know she's still hung up on some guy from yesterday
Once again she's chasing mem'ries and I'm losing everything
But Lord I love her so I'll wait for her looking out my window through the pain
I'll pick up her pieces when he lays her down again
With love and forgiveness I'll give her reasons to stay
Then I close my eyes pretending maybe someday she'll change
And when I won't be left lonely looking out my window through the pain
The devil drove the taxi...

I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love with a girl,
That's what's the matter with me  
I'm in love, 
I'm in love, with a beautiful girl, 
But she don't give a darn about me
to make her love me I tried,
How I sighed and I cried 
But she just refused 
And ever since she's gone away,
I've got those lovesick blues
 
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,"" 
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone 
I'm yearning for it yet 
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy"" 
Twas just a beautiful dream
 
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart  it seems
I got so used to her somehow
But I'm no body's baby 
Now, gee it's awful when you're lonesome 
and get those lovesick blue-oo-oo-oo-oo's

Hands touch her hair is it really as soft as it seems
Fingers caress her gently remove her wedding ring

And realized our dreams could never be

To clear my mind
To give my mind a change of atmosphere
I had some fun
Lying in the sun
Daytone is nice this time of year

Building castles in the sand
And doing all the things we did back then
But just when I think
I'm through lovin you
You're back on my mind again

Back on my mind
Time after time
I wonder if this heart will ever mend
'Cause just when I think

Really doing well
I met someone who thinks the world of me
She talks of things
And whispers loving things
She's everything you'd want a girl to be
But when she holds me tight
The feeling isn't right
It seems as though I'm never gonna win

I'm through lovin you

Sharing each other as we go
Let's take the long way around the world
And let's take it real slow.

These few dreams of mine
Seem hidden behind
A mountain too high to climb
But you were the one
Who said, 'go on, follow your star'

When the song in my heart
Was just a voice in the dark
You could hear my mellow key

There's only one moon
That shines in the night
And only one love in my life

[Chorus]
Only one love in my life,
Only one love in my life
I'm a ship on the open ocean darling
You're my guiding light

My new song today
And I heard someone say
'Man, he sure got it made'

If only they knew how much you
Have made of me
Together we came
From nowhere to fame
And I never could have made it
Alone

For me there's only one moon
That shines in the night
And only one love in my life

It's just my heart that I'm deceiving
Cause deep inside there's no believing

Your fragrance lingers on my pillow and I pretend that you're not really gone
For just a moment I imagine I hear the door and you've come home
Until this empty bed reminds me that instead I live alone

It never lets me out of it's sight
It goes from room to room turning on the lights
Don't your memory ever sleep at night
Don't your memory ever sleep at night?

Your memory keeps reminding me
How good love used to be
Oh, it keeps me good company
That's all that's left between you and me
I go to bed but I know I can't rest
'Cause that's when your memory's at it's heart breaking best
Don't your memory ever sleep at night?

It goes from room to room turning on the lights

Is it over, are you really over him
Is it over, or will you take him back again
If it's over you can let his memory in
Come on over, we'll let our love begin.

You say you can't count the times that he's hurt you
And he's hurt you for the last time
Now you say I'm the one that you're needing
But is the need in your heart or just in your mind.

You know that I'm yours for the asking
If you're really asking, for true love
Words can't express how I want you
Oh, how I want to believe you're giving him up.

Ronnie Milsap,"They're dividing up their playthings
This is yours, this is mine
They're dividing up the bedroom
With an imaginary line.

One is running back to mother
One just wants to be alone
They will cry and pout and walk out
Just like children I have known.
Just like children I have known.

[Chorus]
They're not wiser, they're just grown
It's not a chocolate ice cream cone
It's not a doll-house, it's a home
Just like children I have known.

Almost down to sticks and stones
They'll be lost out on their own
Just like children I have known
Just like children I have known.

And they're gonna cry their eyes out
Once they find out what they've done
Cause their hearts aren't made of candy
That they eat what the other wants.

It could be a happy ending
They don't have to live alone
They could kiss and hug and make up
Just like children I have known
Just like children I have known.

Ronnie Milsap,"You can tell her
That you love her,
A hundred different ways.

But it won't mean as much,
As just the right touch,
At just the right time of day.

You've got to show her
A little each day.
Really show her, You mean what you say.
It's not enough just to tell her you love her.
If you want her to know
You've got to let it show.

When her laughter,
Turns to tears,
For reasons she can't explain.
Remember this,
That just one kiss,
Was all your love needs to say.

Go on...
And show her.
A little each day.
Really show her, You mean what you say.
It's not enough just to tell her you love her.

You better learn to let her know how you feel.
Just remember that you hold the power,
To tell her all that words can't reveal

I've never heard before
And I can't find the love
In her eyes anymore
There's some changes going on

When I'm holding her
I swear I feel the presence of another man

[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me

She sits staring out the window
A million miles away
And when I ask if she's all right
She never has too much to say
Is it somebody we both know
Or somebody she just met
Is she loving him in her mind
While she's lying here in my bed

[Chorus]

Suspicions lead to questions
And questions to alibis
Is it just my imagination
Or has her love turned into lies

Ronnie Milsap,"We all live on a little ball
Spinning somewhere in space
A tiny dot in the universe
Reserved for the human race

And as our planet obeys the laws
Of gravity, nature and time
We must look to the heart to find our part
That we play in the grand design

(We're here to love)
We've all got the power
(Falling in love)
Ah, it's our finest hour
(Only with love)
Though the stars up in heaven
Keep shining down

(We're here to love)
From the ghetto to the Holy land
(We're here to love)
Somebody's needing somebody's hand
And it's time that we all understand
We're here to love

Some will lose their souls to the power of gold
And all that it may possess
They count their blessings by the things that they own
Never learning that more is less

But from the moment we're born until the fading light
And all the seasons that turn in between
It's the love that you give and the hour you live
That's the measure of the life that you lead

(We're here to love)
Oh, we've all got the power
(Falling in love)
Ah, it's our finest hour
(Only with love)
Though the stars up in heaven
Keep shining down

Ah, it's our finest hour

Keep shining down

(We're here to love)
From the ghetto to the Holy land
(We're here to love)
Somebody's needing somebody's hand
And it's time that we all understand
We're here to love

I think it's time that we all understand
We're here to love

Oh, we've all got the power

Ah, it's our finest hour

If stranger things can happen,

One touch is worth a thousand pictures.
What might have been ain't worth a dime.

Now with you here in my arms, I wanna make it last
But the time is flying by and the morning's coming fast.

[Chorus]
Where do the nights go, when I'm with you
Where do the nights go, when I wanna kiss you and hold you tight
Is this what love feels like? Your heart beats like thunder
Every moment you wonder, where do the nights go?
Where do the nights, where do the nights go?

If I had a time machine, I'd make the daylight seem like fleeting
Moments
And every single night would be exactly like the night that we spent
But it won't be long until I'm alone with my desire
'Cause the stars are going out and my heart is still on fire,
Tell me where do the nights go, when I'm with you
Where do the nights go, where do the nights,
Where do the nights go?

[Chorus]

Now with you here in my arms, I wanna make it last
But the time is flying by and the morning's coming fast, tell me.

Here in this smoky place
Suddenly a fleeting memory
in the image of your face

stepped into an evening rain
made my way down the avenue
softly whispering your name

keeps hanging on even though you're gone
Still losing you
Oh I'm still losing you

I dialed your number long distance
I heard a stranger say
The party you have tried to reach
Has recently moved away

I was a fool for leaving you
when you needed me so much
Now I'm the victim of a restless heart
That refuses to forget your touch

Ronnie Milsap,"O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O holy night, O night divine!
O night, O holy night, O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wise men from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!",O Holy Night

I found out those bright lights ain't where I belong
From a phone booth in the rain I called to tell her
I've had a change of dreams I'm comin' home

I can't go on hurtin' this way
She's somewhere in the Smokey Mountain rain

He said that he was goin' as far as Gatlinburg
I climbed up in the cab all wet and cold and lonely
I wiped my eyes and told him about her
I've got to find her!
Can you make these big wheels burn?

I keep on callin' her name

Ronnie Milsap,"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear
And Grace, my fears relieved
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed?

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home, alright

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved the wretch like me

Ronnie Ross,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me"
Ronnie Scott,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Ronnie Scott,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low

You called it our love refrain
It's gone and I'm left completely

I dreamed that our love would linger
But just memories remain
As I gaze at that ring-less finger
Out in the cold again

True, it hurts my pride to step aside for somebody new
But deep down inside my whole world depended on you

I wanted your arms around me
To shelter me from the rain

May not have been the best,
But you can make the times to come
Better than the rest,

Ronnie Stoots,"Long ago a young man sits and plays his waiting game
But things are not the same it seems as in such tender dreams
Slowly passing sailing ships and Sunday afternoon
Like people on the moon I see are things not meant to be

Where do those golden rainbows end?
Why is this song so sad?
Dreaming the dreams I've dreamed my friend
Loving the love I love 

To love is just a word I've heard when things are being said
Stories my poor head has told me cannot stand the cold
And in between what might have been and what has come to pass
A misbegotten guess alas and bits of broken glass

Where do your golden rainbows end?
Why is this song I sing so sad?

Ronny Jordan,"Did I ever tell you about the man who changed my life?
The one I thought, oh. Lord, when I saw him walkin' back in that bar, all tall and
lean with them broad shoulders, sweet lips, I knew that I had died and gone to
Chocolate Heaven

He had a real deep voice, white pearly teeth, his shoe was always shiny.
Long slender fingers manicured perfectly.
The man wore 800-dollar Italian suit, straight from, I dunno, what would they call it,
Milan or Rome or someplace like that?

I knew it wasn't local. 
I said, I got to get next to that.
I haven't seen him in a long time. 
The man was so fine, he could get any good girl into trouble
Can you guess what his name was?
Well
'The Jackal'
'The Jackal'
Say. 
'The Jackal' 

He was fat back cat cool like a Friday afternoon martini, chillin' at a quarter after 5.
Twist of lime, Coke on the side.
The brother loved the high life. 
Had a Ph.D. in street stride.
They called him 'The Jackal'.

He was big Mack daddy super black stylin' a diamonds in the back Cadillac.
Fur-lined boards, white wall wheels, cruise control, built for speed, chrome on evray-thang.
And stereophonic speakers, though he really didn't need them.
When they called him
'The Jackal'.
Say. 
'The Jackal'.

Fly boy was in the buttermilk, hard, livin' fast, livin' large, 6 foot 4 and not an ounce of fat!
When women asked, 'is you a Cat?' He said 'I did more that that.
I'm the firmest of the firm
And in case you, hadn't known, they call me 'The Jackal'.

Served the 18-year bid First Reicker's Island then they hid him in the state
penitentiary. Said the charge was Grand Larceny.
That was 1975, and today, if he's still alive, he'd be living in the park.
Hm. The brother whose claim to fame was that they called him 'The Jackal'.

You find tension where it used to be love
I use my words to shine light inside the dark valleys
The dark alley, U.K., U.S., New York, Cali
From this king to all counties I out loudly
The clammer ? the chain of things that surround me
And seek bounty or stay stridin' and keep strivin'
I seek guidance, like the sun at the dawn I keep risin'
Like that y'all

Brighter day came my way
Had to decide was I gonna stay
Packed my things and I moved on (move on, move on)
That was the day that it all begun

Yo yo yo nobody knows what tomorrow holds, could be pot of gold
Or a mere pot on top ya stove, still ya got to roll
Climb my obstacles and honor those who paved the harder road
Blazed the trails so a brighter day wasn't far to go
So many stories aren't told, so many lights that aren't shone
Still the world remain ignorant to what the heart should know
My love is audio, transmitted, heard, and felt
My words are mirrors to nearer and observe yourself
To receive (ceive), reflect (reflect), magnify
Let a bright light heal a damaged eye
We hold fort like family ties
Shout the battle cry and what we challenged by
Make the shady stand aside so ? risers can arrive
From native to the natural lives you can't deny the natural vibe
On a Mayfield natural high, artificials can abide
I love to see my masses rise
The joy to make your banners hot
The stronger people unite the way we lookin' for a brighter day

Brighter day came my way
Had to decide was I gonna stay
I packed my things and I moved on (move on, move on)
That was the day that it all begun (move on)

Begun, brighter day, brighter day
Came away, came away and I flew away, flew away high, so high
I will fly (fly, whoa) fly away, fly away, fly away
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
We are lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Ay, ay

A brighter day came my way
Had to decide was I gonna stay
I packed my things and I moved on (move on, move on)
That was the day that it all begun (yeah)

Brighter day came my way
I had to decide was I gonna stay
I packed my things and I moved on
That was the day that it all begun

A brighter day came my way
I had to decide was I gonna stay
I packed my things and I moved on

That your better days are done,
Have no fear you'll overcome

That there's nothing left to hold,
That every time you lift your chin 
Your faults have laid you low,
But mercy's in the mightiest and mighty is the judge,
He will lift you up above

Now I am a heart with a head on my shoulders 
And I can say that I'm a different child",Different Child
Roo Panes,"I tried to part the sea,
Find wonders for your love,
I sought the best of me,
But all I showed was what I couldn't be,
Your hush was a beauty I'd not seen,
Your kindness made a gentle wreck of me

Once hope found hope,
And once I traveled winter with the sun
Your heart was my home,
The rest of me will roam into tomorrow, my love,
For tomorrow there's love, there's love

I climbed the highest heights where the sightless go to see,
Fixed fate with steely eyes told her it was not the time for me,
But some things that you give you can't retrieve,
And I wait for a day I'll never see

Once hope found hope,
And once I traveled winter with the sun
Your heart was my home,
The rest of me will roam into tomorrow, my love,
For tomorrow there's love, there's love

It was like the moon tide,
Always rise and then fall,
But now its dead and I'm done,
And I won't cry for you no more

I the lonely captive stand with only memories to hold my hand,
But I'd not change a single thing twas the best and worst of time,
Beneath the yellow clouded moon,
Where buried hopes rise from their tombs,
The whispers call to heaven above,
That you caught me up in the windy arms of love
That you caught me up in the windy arms of love

Oh you caught me up in the windy arms, the windy arms of love,
Oh you caught me up in the windy arms, the windy arms of love
Oh you caught me up in the windy arms, the windy arms of love

Oodles of butter and somethin sweet
Gallons of coffee to wash it down
Bicarbonated soda by the pound

She drug me straight, drug me straight to her room
And I was forgetting what I was doing

[Chorus]

What for (x3)

Well, you wanted her and you got her
But you're still so careless with your words
If you let her go
She'll move on and find someone
She's never coming back
How can you live with that?

Maybe you should think about it
Before you go and break her heart
Maybe you need more time to decide
So you should think about it some more
Ask yourself what for

What for (x7)

I know it sounds like the same old line
I know I seem like I'm the same old guy
Maybe I don't know how to treat you right
Maybe you'll meet someone tomorrow night
You said I lied since the day we met
But I meant every word I said
So don't regret a single day we spent",What For

I try but you don't let me through

But wait don't leave I know I'll change
We're wasting all our time together now

I don't know what to say
Every word just makes you turn away
And I don't know what to do

Then open your eyes and believe in me

I call up and apologize
But you just think its one big lie
Don't you know you're pushing me away?

You can't tell me the past will never
Mean a thing it's more than a memory

Tells me that I'm such a fool

The fire has gone but the smoke remains
And the taste is strong, but I can't explain
The feeling inside that you manage to hide from me
And I won't deny you trick me easily
Blinding lights shine in my eyes
But I see now all the same

(Chorus)
I can't breath your air
Drowning no one cares
Screaming in my ear
But I can't hear a sound
I can't stand your heat
Burns the best of me
Your intensity is pushing me away
Stop pushing me away

Your pace is fast
But I'm bleeding slow
Turn my heart to glass
So the pains on show
And all of your people
Shout what can you do for me
Then you tie me down
Just to set me free

Blinding lights shine in my eyes
But I see now all the same
It's only plastic smiles and lies
But I see now all the same

(Repeat Chorus)

Like a moth drawn to the pain you hypnotise
And I can feel you in my vains electrified
Well I know in the past you've tried to guide me
Hide me drive me, thrill me kill me

Before we found the lines to cross
Did anybody hear the things we didn't mean

You're always running from a storm
So when you feel alone

Look in my direction
When you think we've disappeared
Close your eyes and you will see it you can feel it
The sky's about to clear

And no one else can see the side of me I show
When it's you and me alone
And no one else can hear the things that you don't say
Things that I already know
Stop waiting for a fall
You can't keep running from the storm
So when you feel alone

And no one understands the things you do in me
Gives me strength to set them free
And no one else can know the colour that you show
See your shadow slowly grow

I'll catch you if you fall
I'll give you shelter from it all
So when you feel alone

Caught a glimpse then hit floor
Moving backwards, can't let go

Forgotten flavour that I can't replace

Why won't this moment last?
And carry on till, all that's around us

Nothing but you and me

floating weightless in the void
Just the whisper of you voice
Washing over holding me
Can you stand and talk a while
Thought that I'd forgotten how to smile

Why won't this moment last?
And carry on till, all that's around us

For me tomorrow burns away and melts into today
In your eyes I can hide
I'm just losing time

Drain your glass and fill them onece again
Tonight will be ourmemory

Until we meet again

We're psychotic from the lack of sleep but we're
Staying up so we can saygoodbye

We'll all be face to face again
Till then let's fly into tomorrow

I s this rush excitement or is it fear
Tell me that I'm not talking to myself

Lighting up the room like a solar flare
Praying that this might be my best mistake

Your sentences are far too clean
You never look me in the eye
Afraid of what I'd realize

It's always ""What is it you're drinking?""
I never quite know what you're thinking
You know your hopeless lives are sinking

Pit stop
It's time that you were made to see
Wake up
Today's your anniversary

Stop and think of what is wrong
Life is not so very long
Don't escape by work routine
You are where you've always been

You find you have to scream and shout
Just to let the tension out
Is that what life is all about

Your fate Try not to let it be
Too late
Change your own biography
Pit stop
It's time that you were made to see
Wake up
Today's your anniversary

You never say just what you're,
It's always ""What is it you're""

Roots Manuva,"The dark art
Bring the pensive dub
The dub is wise
Open your eye-dem

From nineteen-long time them let loose the crackin'
The god that 'nuff praise is Sterling collapse
Eyes closed, heads bowed, I hear the prayer
Proud, them must sing praise to the pound sign, sire
Hoping that they read from their pinnacle lessons
'Nuff buy scratch cards and gain jack-shit
Nothin' ain't fair in love, strife and war
Fat cats get fat while the poor stay brass
Nothin' could go on without brack-a-tiv(?)
Will you live to work or will you work to live?
Will you step to the future or dwell on the past?
For what be your fight, be it color or class?
Know if you can't ask this, the tip is me
I and I, scammin' on a fat piece of pie
And as the greed gets thicker, minds get sicker
Bloodthirsty fiends cap cocaine and liquor

[Chorus]
These streets is thick with bad cliques looking for that raise
It don't really matter how these kids get paid
'cause we're living in the days of ill soul decay

We all got to be something and somebody
We all got to find them modes to get large
But when that love for the pound starts flooding
Every thought we hold, devil disciples collect souls
Like my man's bouncing weed ounces and everything's nice
Then in comes the crackle it bounces him tight
Triple dividends, new-found rank and position
But more reason to be cautious, much more to defend
Ends is meetin', criss skeets is greetin'
Bloods them never dreamed shit could feel so criss
While rollin' round the city in a brand-new Benz
Feelin' kinda deft 'cause there's cash to collect
Ego's on the boost now that ego needs feed
Watch the devil dance, proceed as them lick up the powder
Mans start feel like Jesse West 'cause the next plan be to
Take out the middleman and make more grand

[Chorus x2]

The roots of evil run deep and keep runnin'
You sticka with the cunning while the war drums are drummin'
If you don't see now, you might never see
'Cause the enemy strikes with them sick-tight ballistics
Sadistic, no error, in the guise of a friend
That was tight from way back, chewin' up the fat
Talkin' 'bout how we gonna keep stuff true
Through the thick through the thin, closer than the skin to flesh
But everybody has their price
When the beast strikes ain't no tellin' what will happen
Just when you was thinkin' you was in the same team
You catch the cold frowsy whiff of a snake in your midst
Bringin' blitz to your plans when he done shook hands
And said he's cool with his cut
Now he wants to cut my throat and take the whole lot

I knew it was love
I think we're going to make it

Looks like we made it 
Look how far we've come my baby 
We mighta took the long way 
We knew we'd get there someday 

They said, ""I bet they'll never make it"" 
But just look at us holding on 
We're still together still going strong

Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'

Looks like we made it

Roque Valero,"Dime como yo escondo la luz de mis ojos 
cuando te miro sin que tu lo sepas 
como arreglo o enderezo mis labios torcidos 
que no se canzan de sonreir 
dime como le digo a mis manos que no hablen 
y a mis silencios que no intenten tocarte 
como duermo a mi insomnio y apago las velas 
como me quito estas ganas de vivir 

Dime como no escucho todas tus palabras 
si aunque sean repetidas quiero escucharlas 
como cambio o reescribo mis suenos contigo 
si es tan sabrosos sonarlos asi 
y es que yo disimulo pero me hago un nudo 
y digo cosas que aun no tengo que decir 
y comienzo a extanarte te veo en todas partes 
y es que ando de puntillas solo por ti 
dime como no me lanzo de esta nube 
si es tan facil salvarme en tu risa 
voy de prisa no te asustes 
y en la lluvia no veas malicia 
que es la brisa me ha traido 
caminando solo de puntillas 
dime como puedo hacer 
dime como 

dime como no sueno con quedarme siempre 
durmiendo en tus miradas largas y ausentes 
como cambio o reescribo mi historia contigo 
si ya esta escrita que te puedo decir 
dime como no anhelo rozar tu delirios 
encontrar sitio en cualquier tonta ilusion 
como duermo a mis ansias y a mis corazones 
como me quito estas ganas de vivir 

Dime como no escucho todas tus palabras 
si aunque sean repetidas quiero escucharlas

Roque Valero,"nuestra es tan extraÃ±a y divertida
y no creo que nadie se atreverÃ­a
a contarla, emularla o discutirla
pues carece de sentido y melodÃ­a

nuestra historia no es tan buena ni es tan mala
y aunque lo parezca no es la equivocada
solo es una rara historia que va que regresa
que sueÃ±a y promete ser un poco diferente

nuestra historia es tan compleja y dispareja
absoluta relegada e incocente
que si tuvo algun pasado no hay presente
y el futuro se me hace inconsistente

esta llena de reclamos olvidados
fueron muchos los errores oxidades
solo es una rara historia que va que regresa
que sueÃ±a y promete ser un poco diferente

coro:
nuestra historia es tan extraÃ±a
que aunque quisiera cantarla
no podria mi garganta
esta vencida y desgastada
de tanto gritar tu nombre
al llegar y no verte en casa
se me gasta la memoria
recordandote en la cama

nuestra historia es tan absurda
es tan loca y humana
que el final es un comienzo
y tengo que aguantar mis ganas
de abrazarte por las noches
y buscarte en las maÃ±anas
se me acaban los recuerdos esperando tu regreso

nuestra historia tonta y de telenovela
esta llena de antibajos y condenas
no es tan larga no es tan corta ni es eterna
cuesta mucho sacrificio mantenerla

hay problema serios con las emociones
tienen madurez y precipitaciones
esta es una rara historia que va que regresa
que sueÃ±a y promete ser un poco diferente

nuestra historia es de venganzas y mentiras
de estrategias y de falsas reconquistas
hay llamadas que nunca han debido hacerse
y miradas que el tiempo las desvanece

esta historia me ha hecho perder la cordura
ella empieza se termina y continÃºa
esta es una tonta historia que va que regresa
que sueÃ±a y promete ser un poco diferente

Ring for the butler with the tray on his sleeve
Tea time in the parlor this afternoon
Please round these unsuspecting guests

This pictures following me
This place, it gives me the creeps
There's something lurks behind the curtain
We're serving dinner tonight
It's full of poisoned delights
Why is the candle missing from the mantle

All is well in the manor here called grim

[Chorus]
Wondering what this whole night will bring
Unsure of your intentions
Wondering what this whole night will bring
As you seek your infliction

The colonel has his sights on the mistress dress
As he salivates in his drink
The woman in red snickers at his face
How can you think of such thoughts at a time like this

Suddenly out went the lights
I hear a thud in the dark
Someone screams and everybody scuffles
The lights are coming back on
The colonel lies on the floor
There will be hell to pay
Whomever did this

All is well in the manor here called grim

Rory,"The other night there was
This dream that crept inside me
I had the strangest walk
Half of a dozen legs
Space trips and ocean rifts
Concrete cracks all look the same
I saw the whole damn armada fall into file

It's not my day today

Put on your face
And if you don't like the sound then turn away
Because it's all so obvious
You don't have the means to stay alive
So give her praise
And if you can't stand the sights then look away
Because it's all so obvious
You don't have the means to stay alive

The morning I awoke
Got up and out of bed
I saw the common man
And my breath fall flat
I saw the children scurry
Following their providers
In a nauseous rush
In a dizzy hurry
Everyone of you
All working for the same
You're hopeless brainwashed drones
There's no other way!?

Put on your face
And if you don't like the sound, then turn away
Because it's all so obvious
You don't have the means to stay alive
So give her praise
And if you can't stand the sights then look away
Because it's all so obvious
You don't have the means to stay alive

Put on your face
And if you don't like the sound, then turn away
Because it's all so obvious
You don't have the means to stay alive
So give her praise
And if you don't like the sights then look away
Because it's all so obvious
You don't have the means to stay alive

And I take these pills that make me feel better all the time
But they hypnotize my mind
Convince me that this world's still flat

Like the things you need

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,

No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,

I've tried and I've tried to make it so clear, 
But my time is just wasted I fear. 
Well it's only an old song but it serves it's purpose so well, 
By the cry in your voice I can tell. 
When you sing there's a feeling behind the words, 
That brings it all back again. 

I'm reaching, I'm reaching, while you slip away, 
I'm searching for words I can say. 
I'm listening, I'm listening, tryin' not to hear, 
You say that we might meet some day. 

There's a picture that's faded and curling from it's frame, 
Of a face that smiles patiently. 
It might smile forever to make me feel better, 
But I just might wait to see. 

Oh I'm reaching, I'm reaching while you slip away, 
I'm searching for words I can't say. 
I'm listening, I'm listening tryin' not to hear, 
You say that we might meet some day. 

There's answers to questions that we both wanna know, 
But those answers keep evading me. 
There's rhymes and there's reasons, there's rights and there's wrongs. 
For being what you are to me. 

If I had a a reason I'd tell you what it is, 
Would you do the same thing for me?

That the day will mean nothing for me.

If you want a little lovin
You gotta start real slow
She's gonna love you tonight now
If you just treat her right now

Gotta make her feel good
Tell her that you love her
Like you know you should
So if you don't treat her right
She won't love you tonight

A toothbrush, a guitar, got no tail to drag

Mind full of notions that I just can't explain
Reasons why just can't be supplied

Trapped by a heartache and freed by my will
Sentenced to wander, so much time to kill
Hear my plea and rescue me
Packed my sorrows in an overnight bag
But I'll be gone much longer than that
Who knows when we'll meet again

Too many sleepless nights put my soul on edge
So many restless moods play heavy in my head

Too many sleepless nights put my soul on edge
And so many restless moods play heavy in my head

Wrote down my thoughts and I sealed them in hope
Sent them to you in a blue envelope

There's a call out for your head.

She says he's too old to have these growing pains, 
But something keeps him moving, living on through the night. 

But as the night approaches, a change is in the air, 
His heart is pumping fast, he's got no cares. 
The music befriends him, it can take him anywhere.

Rory Gallagher,"Well, I was born on the side of a road 
A gap in the hedge, did you hear what I said? 
Born in a house with no slates, 
But I wouldn't switch, I didn't have a stitch. 
Always been out on a limb, 
I've been hard to mend like a kick in the shins 
You only see me smile when I eat up a country mile 

Born on the green light, a mission to move, 
Something to groove, an itch in my shoes, 
I heard the wail of the train 
From a burning stack and I jumped on the back 
We'll the engineer threw the switch 
And got to my brain, I've never been the same 
You'll only see me smile when I eat up a country mile 

Gotta make tracks, gotta loose some rust, 
Grease my heels, I'll race to bust, 
Don't blink your eye or you won't see me again 

Well I was born on the spoke of a wheel, 
Not part of a set and I'm runnin' yet 
I ran before I could walk, 
The price of the fare was hardly ever there 
I saw an eighteen-wheeler move 
And I couldn't choose, I just had to cruise, 
You'll only see me smile when I eat up a country mile 

Well I was born on the wrong side of the road, 
A gap in the hedge, did you hear what I said? 
Born in a house with no slates 
But I wouldn't switch, I didn't have a stitch. 
I've always been out on a limb, 
I've been hard to mend like a kick in the shins

Down by the low, low land 
Where the air is dark and sinister?

Hid in the reeds are eyes that peek, voices I can't understand

To the silent sky 

Daughter of the Everglades 
You never made it clear 
Daughter of the Everglades 
If you want to be here 
Child of the river 
I never saw your tears 

Well, you looked like your mama 
Before you walked, you swam 
Learned to makes snake tails stew 
From your daddy, a crazy talkin' fisherman 
In this place there is no law; the river makes all the rules 
What they are I found out
When I came back to look for you 

Daughter of the Everglades 
Why did you bring me here? 
Daughter of the Everglades 
My love has turned to fear 
Child of the river 
Let me feel you near 

Well, you laughed in them
But I knew after a year 
That you'd cry in the city 
I should have not brought you here 
So far from the Bayou, down in the low, low land 
Don't know why you left me 
But now I understand 

Take me back to the river 
Down in the smoky ground 
Where snakes crawl you don't cheat 
By the river you live by now 
In the swell of the river, the river sails so proud 
I should have gone there with you 
But now they tell me you have drowned

I can feel you near

I know I'll find you hear

People claimed that he could cure anyone
He had the power there is no doubt
From his healing hands the light shone all about

No magic potion or mystic words
His eyes stared at you, no sound was heard
People came from north and south
To see this faith healing man, see what he was all about
Cured the young and cured the old
Soon the whole nation knew his name

Seventh son of a seventh son
Is it to late, now that I've come?
Seventh son of a seventh son
Is it to late? You know why I've come?

Outside his door where queues ten deep
Soon this faith healing man could get no sleep
On the street they milled outside
Soon this man had to spend his days inside

He cured a woman who could not speak
And you know the blind child? Now he can see
Never asked for payment or took anything from them
Faith healing man was not the same

One day a man with a big cigar
Drove into town in a long, long silver car
He made a deal, said thin boy would go far
Said he'd make this faith healing country boy into a movie star

The seventh son of a seventh son
He moved away from this small town
To the city he soon came
He looked up in lights, saw his name

See all the people who knew him well
As though he was still here, the stories they all tell
About the time he made the lame boy walk
But know you have to pay hear him talk

One day he returned from the city of lights
You know something had happened there, his powers had died
But know he says he won't cure no more
Faith healin' man you have returned

In the nick of time

Things were getting hot 
Only I know where we stashed the loot 
The mob wants to know the spot. 

They got the muscle in from Cleveland 
The fire-power from Detroit 
They missed me in New Jersey 
Though things got pretty tight. 

Caught my scent in Richmond 
At the Hotel Savoy 
But I got out the laundry shute 
And went to Chicago, Illinois.

Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra

Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a Los 17

Rosalia de Souza,"Nasci lá na Bahia
De Mucama com feitor
Meu pai dormia em cama
Minha mãe no pisador

Meu pai só dizia assim, venha
Minha mãe dizia sim, sem falar
Mulher que fala muito perde logo seu amor
Deus fez primeiro o homem
A mulher nasceu depois

Por isso é que a mulher
Trabalha sempre pelos dois
Homem acaba de chegar, tá com fome
A mulher tem que olhar pelo homem

E é deitada, em pé, mulher tem é que trabalhar
O rico acorda tarde, já começa resmungar
O pobre acorda cedo, já começa trabalhar

Vou pedir ao meu Babalorixá
Pra fazer uma oração pra Xangô
Pra por pra trabalhar gente que nunca trabalhou",Maria Moita

Prendió la luz de la mañana
Y escribió en papel, una y otra vez 
Me despido, me marcho pa' no volver
Salió a vivir con tantas ganas 
Que echó a correr pidiendo nada
Y empezó a creer, que por una vez 
El dolor que sentía le haría bien

Lo que duele no es irse, duele despedirse
Lo que duele no es el invierno gris
Lo que mata y remata es la cicatriz
Lo que hoy duele, mañana puede que sea nada
Porque un mundo despierta, cuando el otro se apaga

El corazón no se equivoca
Se guarda todo lo que toca
Late por amor, late por dolor
Se confunde, se entrega, se parte en dos
Sabe perdonar, pero no sabrá olvidarse
Porque el corazón solo sabe hacer las paces

El dolor que sentía se iría

Lo que duele no es el invierno gis",Al Filo de la Madrugada

Mejor vivir sin miedo 

Sin miedo, lo malo se nos va volviendo bueno

Y nos hacemos aves, sobrevolando el suelo, así 
Sin miedo, si quieres las estrellas vuelco el cielo 
No hay sueños imposibles ni tan lejos 
Si somos como niños 
Sin miedo a la locura, sin miedo a sonreír 

Sin miedo sientes que la suerte está contigo

Sin miedo, las olas se acarician con el fuego 
Si alzamos bien las yemas de los dedos 
Podemos de puntillas tocar el universo, sí 
Sin miedo, las manos se nos llenan de deseos 
Que no son imposibles ni están lejos 
Si somos como niños 
Sin miedo a la locura, sin miedo a sonreír 

Sin miedo sientes que la suerte está contigo

Cuando una noche de amor desesperados 
Caigamos juntos y en redados 
La alfombra y el alrededor, acabarán desordenados 
Cuando una noche de amor que yo no dudo 
La eternidad venga seguro 
Tú y yo, el destino y el corazón, seremos uno 

Yo soy la tierra de tus raíces: el talismán de tu piel lo dice 
Yo soy la tierra de tus raíces: lo dice el corazón y el fuego de tu piel 
Yo soy la tierra de tus raíces: el talismán de tu piel lo dice 
Yo soy la tierra de tus raíces: a ver que dices tú 

El talismán de tu piel me chiva 
Que ando descalza de esquina a esquina 
Por cada calle que hay en tus sueños 
Que soy el mar de todos tus puertos

Le herida se te ira del pensamiento
Y aunque el dolor
Es lento se seca con el sol

Lo el viento renace
La alegría en el lamento
Y olvidare, cuanto llore

Hoy llorándote
Mañana recordando que
Cuando el alma del amor se aleja
Entero el corazón se desmadeja

Hoy llorándote
Diciendo y recordando que
Si la vida se deshoja entera
Nos vuelve a florecer la primavera

Con el tiempo la pena
Amainara en el sentimiento
Y aunque se amarre dentro

Se cura con el mar la fe es ensueño
Se queda la tristeza medio en cueros
Y alguna vez nombrándote

Hoy llorándote
Mañana recordando que
Cuando el alma del amor se aleja
Entero el corazón se desmadeja

Hoy llorándote

Si la vida se deshoja entera

Rosana,"El día que se hizo tarde
Cada noche te esperaba
Con las mismas ganas locas
De que llegaras temprano
De desarmarme en tu boca

Y venias tú y la noche
Y la noche y tu venia
A dejar que yo vertiera
En tu cuerpo fantasía

Pero un día se hizo tarde
Pensé que solo era eso
Porque la noche si vino
Y no dejo de darme un beso

Un día, otro día y otro
De demostraron sin duda
Que la noche es mejor que tu
La noche es más fiel que oscura

Zarandee los recuerdos
Dando vueltas en la cama
Y en una de tantas vueltas
Me encontré la madrugada

De un salto me fui a buscarte
Por donde solías venir
Y te vi, ¡maldito seas!
Igual que te vi partir

Un soplo de amor di al viento
Por si te lo hacía llegar
Pero hasta la misma brisa
Se canso de ir detrás

Nunca supe los motivos
Todavía los ignoro
Y aunque no lo creas, ¡por Dios!
Te juro que aun te añoro

Me abandono la cordura
Cuando dejaste mi vida
Como el tiempo a las paredes
Así tu amor me hizo ruina

El día que se hizo tarde
Pensé que solo era eso
Porque la noche si vino
Y no dejo de darme un beso

Rosana,"Dime donde va la fe
Que se desploma cuando no te ve
Dime donde va el amor
Si te vas, si te pierdo, dimelo

Adonde ira a parar el desconsuelo
Si te empieza a echar de menos, y
Dime donde voy a ir, yo sin ti

Dime, dime
Que quiero saber, donde voy a caer
Donde estas que no encuentro, las alas del viento.

Dime, dime
Que quiero saber, como puedo volver
A encender la luz, apagandome

Dime donde va la fe
Cuando no queda nada que creer.
Dime donde va el amor
Cuando hay sentimientos que sin ti se mueren dentro

Sin ganas de luchar
Nace un credo y siempre queda cerca un cielo
Pero dime, si hay un credo para mi
Si estoy sin ti

",Dime
Rosana,"Tu me regalas la gloria
A través de tu mirada
Me conviertes en domingo

Al son de los cascabeles
Los domingos en el cielo

Los milagros y las flores
Al son de los cascabeles

Al compás de los gorriones
Te canto lo que te quiero

Cascabelea la lluvia
Bailando sobre mi cuerpo
Mientras yo rezo tu nombre
Al ritmo del movimiento
Tu me llevas hasta el cielo
Tan cerca del viejo sol
Que amanece a media noche
Con la luna abierta al sol

Al son de los cascabeles
Los domingos en el cielo
Se confunden las canciones

El otoño se desnuda
Y el verano se despierta

Rosana,"Puedo abrazar el mar
Bajo la luna llena
Besos de agua y sal
Mojan mi silueta

Puedo encender el sol
O aliarme a las estrellas
Colgarme, no caer
Y perecer abrazandote

Soy capaz de dibujar
En el aire margaritas
Que se puedan deshojar
Soy capaz de renacer
Y en invierno hacer brotar la primavera
Bailando al centro de esta tierra

Sonreir, respirar
Brindar con las mareas
Cansarme de sembrar
Dunas de poemas

Puedo esparcir la luz
Y colorear la espera
Dormir entre tu piel
Y amanecer sonriendote

Ey, eh, hacer girar la esfera
Ey eh, tanto como quiera
Ey eh, brindar con las mareas
Bajo la luna llena
Ey eh, abrazandote

Cariño del mío me quedo en el

Caricias amanezco nevando de pena

Amor a carcajadas, sin ti me ahoga tanto llover
Si llego de invierno, abrázame bien, que es
Calor, lo que quiero tener

Pa' calor la lumbre de tu cuerpo
Pa' calor la dulce golosina del amor
Pa' calor salpica el sentimiento
Y el corazón se derrama por dentro

Hay calor al filo de tus manos
Hay calor allí donde se entrega la pasión
Pa' calor tu boca y el verano
Hacen del frío calor

Siguiendo tu estela, al centro de la noche cuando
El frío se cuela, tu amor me da candela
Me quedo temblando, si tu desapareces amananece hasta
El sol tiritando

Tu cobijas la calma, Contigo la alegría se
Descalza, sin ti me duele tanto querer
Si llego de invierno, abrázame bien

Que podría pasar si tu fueras la
Tierra tu mirada un horizonte gris

Si llenaron tu pecho de papales pegados
Que después con el humo se caerán a mi lado

Para darle cobija a lo que queda de vida?

Que podría pasar si cayera en tus manos
El latido de ese corazón
Que agoniza dejando el universo encerrado
En un cuarto donde no hay amor 
Si aun te fuera posible entender que es de todos
Y que todos los hombres pueden mas que uno solo?

Lo cuentan los cuentos 
Lo cuenta la gente y juro por todo que no me lo invento 
Algunos amores 
Se acaban rompiendo 
Y viene de viejo que tanta tristeza termina diciendo: 

No ves que pierdo la vida 
No ves que me estoy muriendo 
Que cuando aprieta la soledad 
Es cuando ahoga el recuerdo 
No ves que estando tan lejos 
Se nos marchitan los sueños 
Entre los brazos del desamor, se esta apagando este fuego 

Te come la pena 
Te matan los celos 
Te sangra la herida y la vida se escapa por un sumidero 
Lo cantan las hojas 
Lo silban los vientos 
Y viene de antaño que el mar se hace llanto y el mundo desierto

No ves que pierdo la vida 
No ves que me estoy muriendo 
Que cuando aprieta la soledad 
Es cuando ahoga el recuerdo 
No ves que estando tan lejos 
Se nos marchitan los sueños 
Entre los brazos del desamor, se esta apagando este fuego 
Y aunque no quiero morir de amor 
De amor estoy muriendo 

Y de entre amores perdidos, llegan amores eternos 
Y viene de siempre que tanta tristeza se va con el tiempo 

La ra la la que cuando aprieta la soledad

Y nos bebimos la noche 
Y nos quedamos despiertos 
Y derrochando caricias 
Brindamos tan solo con agua de besos 
Y nos bebimos la noche 
Y comprendimos bebiendo 
Que es tan grande el querer 
Que nos da de beber y seguimos sedientos 

La primera noche de cada estación 
Me la bebo contigo 
Como aquel verano que se deshojaba 
Prometiéndonos mil y una noche cuando regresara 
Llovieron hojas de otoño 
Para abrigar el invierno 

Pasaron mil y una noche 
Ya no quisimos perdernos 
Y de las cuatro estaciones robamos noches de sueño 
Y nos bebimos el universo 

Y nos bebimos la noche 
Y nos quedamos despiertos 
Y derrochando caricias 
Brindamos tan solo con agua de besos 
Y nos la noche 
Y comprendimos bebiendo 
Que es tan grande el querer

La primera noche de cada estación 
Amanezco contigo",Mil y Una Noche (Mariachi) [*]

Que te libre de esta pena 
Pido a dios 
Que ponga besos 
Cuando yo te duela 

Pídeme que pida a dios 
Agua de las piedras 
Pa beber en el desierto 
Donde tu me dejas 
Una tormenta de arena 
Que arranca de un soplo la vida 
Que me hiela si tu no me abrigas 
Que me arranca del cielo de un golpe mortal 
Que me arrastra, me empuja y me quema 
Que me arrasa en un fuego de arena 
Y me deja sin ganas de resucitar 
Que me hunde 
Y te vas 

Que me arrastra, me empuja y me quema 
Me arrodilla en un fuego de arena 
Y me deja sin ganas de resucitar 
Que me hunde 
Y te vas",Tormenta de Arena
Rosana,"Sería bonito poder inventar
Un jarabe para la tristeza, para podértelo dar
Una vitamina quitapenas, para poder regalar
Un remedio para cuando duela

Un apaño, un remedio
Una cura de sueño, una dosis de esperanza
Un tratamiento, de viento, si quieres volar

Para festejar la primavera, un comprimido de amor
Pa sentir calor y dar candela, dos infusiones de sol
Pa las cosas malas hierba buena

Un apaño, un remedio, una cura de sueño
Una dosis de felicidad

Vive la felicidad, agitese antes de usar
Vive la felicidad, se puede consumir sin consultar
Vive la felicidad, no tiene caducidad,
Siente la felicidad, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Marca el corazón y el calendario
No se te vaya a olvidar
Para q te tomes a diario, jugo de felicidad
No produce efectos secundarios

Que bonito sería
Y lo bien que vendría
Una dosis concentrada de alegría
Sería bonito intentar

Inyectar lo bueno de la vida, para podértelo dar
Una pócima pa' las heridas, para poder regalar
Un parche de amor por si suspiras
Que bonito sería
Y lo bien que vendría una dosis de felicidad

Vive la felicidad, agitese antes de usar
Vive la felicidad, se puede consumir sin consultar
Vive la felicidad, no tiene caducidad,
Siente la felicidad, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Dos cucharadas de alegría para cada día
Unas gotitas de cariño al despertar
Mantengase al alcance de quien lo quiera probar

Rosana,"Quitame la vida, pero no tus besos
Róbame la lluvia
Pero no me niegues agua de tu cuerpo

Dame la tristeza pa' que llores de alegría
Dame mil caricias pero matame de sed
Déjame en el centro del infierno que podría

Aguantar el fuego si me dieras de beber
Si me das tu boca, de tu boca bebo
A sorbitos agua del cielo

Agua bendita, tiene tus besos
No me los quites que me enveneno
Dame la vida, bebiendo amor
Agua que viene del corazón

Bendito milagro el que dibuja tu sonrisa
Bendita tu alma y tu forma de querer
Bendigo tu nombre y el amor se me arrodilla
Bendíceme siempre con el agua de tu piel

Bendices mi vida y la llenas de cosquillas
Me dices que no, que si, que no,  que quiéreme
Si te vas me empapas con un jarro de agua fría
Y eso es lo único que no quiero beber
Si me das tu boca, de tu boca bebo
A sorbitos agua del cielo

Agua bendita, tiene tus besos
No me los quites que me enveneno
Dame la vida, bebiendo amor
Agua que viene, del corazón

Agua bendita, agua de besos
Agüita fresca
Que va calándome el sentimiento
Dame la vida, bebiendo amor
Agua que viene, del corazón
En aguas tuyas bebo yo, agua de Dios

Si me das tu boca, de tu boca bebo
A sorbitos agua del cielo

Agua bendita, tiene tus besos
No me los quites que me enveneno
Dame la vida, bebiendo amor
Agua que viene, del corazón

Agua bendita, agua de besos

Rosana,"Yo soy quien te quiere, quien mas te ha querido 
Quien dio 80 vueltas al mundo contigo
Yo soy tu otra parte, tu medio latido 
Tu cuarto creciente, tu nido de amor

Si tu no me quieres, allá tu contigo 
Si no me has querido, peor para vos 
Yo sigo queriendo donde nos quisimos 
Donde dibujamos aquel corazón

Dibujamos aquel corazón, un verano en el río 
Dibujamos aquel corazón, con tu nombre y el mio 
En invierno quisimos volver 
Y aprendí que la tiza no escribe en el frío
Dibujamos aquel corazón 
Y el invierno ha dejado un borrón
Es absurdo querer subrayar lo que borra el olvido 
De momento no voy a gastarme la vida contigo

Me quedo el reinado de tus sentimientos 
Así te lo digo asi te lo cuento
El medio el principio y el fin de tus cuentos
Se escribe con tinta de mi corazón

Si tu no me quieres, allá tu contigo
Si vas a olvidarme peor para vos
Saber que quererse no obliga al suicidio 
No impide que acabes muriendo de amor 

Dibujamos aquel corazón, un verano en el río

Rosana,"Hay cosas que te escribo
En cartas para no decirlas
Hay cosas que escribo en canciones
Para repetirlas

Hay cosas que están en mi alma

Cuanto te he querido

Hay cosas que escribo en la cama
Hay cosas que escribo en el aire
Hay cosas que siento tan mías
Que no son de nadie

Hay cosas que escribo contigo
Y hay cosas que sin ti no valen
Hay cosas y cosas
Que acaban llegando tan tarde

Hay cosas, que se lleva el tiempo
Sabe Dios a donde
Hay cosas que siguen ancladas
Cuando el tiempo corre

Hay cosas que están en mi alma
Y quedaran conmigo cuando me haya ido
En todas acabo sabiendo
Cuanto me has querido

Rosana,"Tengo triste el corazón
Tengo pena en el amor
Busco remedio a este dolor
Pongo el alma en alquiler
Tiene vistas al querer
Busco y comparto amanecer

Pongo el mar a orilla de tus besos
Traigo lluvia por si tienes sed
No preguntes amor
Amor, sólo sé que el mundo
Nació donde yo te encontré

Solo sé que me vi con la vida
Aleteando en el vacío
Con el sol en la maleta
Por si el frío
Me agarraba sin saber a dónde ir

Sólo sé que dormí
En el nido donde duerme el universo
Con tu risa decorándome el silencio
Pido al aire que me baile para tí

Tengo triste el corazón
Tengo pupa en el amor
Busco refugio a este dolor
Traigo el aire envuelto
En un suspiro de pasión

Tengo que pedirte, por favor
Que desembales mi corazón

Pongo el mar a orilla de tus besos
Traigo lluvia por si tienes sed
Tengo un nudo en la voz
Perdóname amor
Las penas no caben en una canción

Solo sé que me vi con la vida
Aleteando en el vacío
Con el sol en la maleta
Por si el frío
Me agarraba sin saber a dónde ir

Sólo sé que dormí
En el nido donde duerme el universo
Con tu risa decorándome el silencio
Pido al aire que me baile para ti

Así, resguardame del viento
En una esquinita de tu piel
Voy desembalando el universo
Por si tú lo vuelves a querer

Solo sé que me vi con la vida
Aleteando en el vacío
Con el sol en la maleta
Por si el frío
Me agarraba sin saber a dónde ir

Sólo sé que dormí
En el nido donde duerme el universo
Con tu risa decorándome el silencio

Que me ahoga si respiro de ese aire

No me deja el corazón latir

Que de tanto suplicarte se ha hecho fuego
Que me tiene echando leña en un  bolero
Solo pide, si te vas a ir

Quítamela tú, quítamela suerte
Quítamela pronto, si voy a perderte

Mira, se me va, la vida
Cuando duele tanto el corazón
De latir se  me olvida

Mira, como pierdo el rumbo
Cuando estas tan lejos se me va
La  ilusión tras de ti, dando tumbos

Este día que se apaga
Esta herida que envenena
Esta noche que no acaba
No la quiero

No me deja ser feliz, sin ti solo espero
Que me creas si te juro que te quiero
De morirme junto a ti, no tengo miedo
Tengo miedo, de vivir sin ti

Mira, se me va, la vida
Cuando duele tanto el corazón
De latir se  me olvida

Cuando estas tan lejos se me va

Te hace llorar, te llena de alegría
Te clava un puñal y te lame la herida
Te quita, te da, te sube, y te derriba

Es lo que tiene, a ver si adivinas
Te deja entrar en el mundo
Gozar del amor, respirar muy profundo
Perder el control hasta encontrar el rumbo
La puedes usar, pero no te la quedas
Se mide en edad, se cuenta en primaveras

Mira los siglos que lleva
Es un segundo en la eternidad
Es mucho más que una cuenta atrás
Es un legado de Dios, o una ilusión
Pero esto es, vivir la vida

Te da billete de ida
Se paga de noche, se enciende de día
Se vuelve canción en una melodía
Será tu dolor, tu mejor medicina
Será del color con el que tú la miras

Es una caja de sueños
Es un segundo en la eternidad
Es mucho más que una cuenta atrás
Es un legado de Dios, o una ilusión
Pero esto es, vivir la vida

¿Para que? Para nada 

¿Para que una tregua de abrazos? 
Ni matar ni morir a balazos 
¿Para que? ¿para que? Para nada 

¿Para que continuar viviendo deprisa 
Buscando la suerte en la mierda que pisas? 
Te vas a volver a quedar sin volar ¿Para que? 
Para nada

Para nada te vale una vida varada 
Hoy te toca romper la baraja 
Porque anclado ni subes ni bajas 
Para ser, para estar, para echar a volar 
Hoy te toca soltar las amarras 
¿Para que emborracharte de olvido
Si te vas a vivir lo vivido?

Salio de la trinchera desnuda sin bandera 
Y con ganas de volaaar 
Se fue, se fue, se fue 
Como bala perdida sin un campo de minas 
Se fue, se fue, se fue 
No espero la mañana donde todo se aclara y se fue

Abrio la puerta del mundo con la llave equivocada

Y quiso buscar yendo mar adentro 
Y quiso parar olas en el viento 
Y quiso encontrar lo que llevaba dentro 
Hurgando en alta mar

Anclado en una barca de madera 
Contando estrellas se dejó llevar 
Por el vaivén de la marea

When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you

That's where the two will go,

With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who

It sounds like some lonesome song got in my soul

It's the noise that you hear when my baby hits town
With his long hair flyin', man, he's hard to take
What you s'posed to do when your baby thinks he's a train?

He eats money like a train eats coal
He burns it up and leaves you in the smoke
If you wanna catch a ride, you wait 'til he unwinds

Face down in a memory but feeling all right
So who does your past belong to today?
Baby, you don't say nothing when you're feeling this way

The girls in the bars thinking, ""who is this guy?""
But they don't think nothing when they're telling you lies
You look so careless when they're shooting that bull
Don't you know heartaches are heroes when their pockets are full

Tell me you're trying to cure a seven-year ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say, ""when is he gonna give us some room""
The girls say, ""God I hope he comes back soon""

Everybody's talking but you don't hear a thing
You're still uptown on your downhill swing
Boulevard's empty, why don't you come around?
Baby, what is so great about sleeping downtown?

Splitting your dice to be someone you're not
You say you're looking for something you might've forgot
Don't bother calling to say you're leaving alone
'Cause there's a fool on every corner when you're trying to get home

Just tell 'em you're trying to cure a seven-year ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say, ""when is he gonna give us some room""
The girls say, ""God I hope he comes back soon""

Rosanne Cash,"Why did she wear that dress tonight?
Why did she bring that stranger
She looks put out in party lights
Which leaves us all in danger
When she drops her perfumed hanky

I look for love (repeat 4 times)

I hate the way they carry on
These fashion consultations
Do all the wires we sing along
Require such insulation
Fused with fear or charged with anger

I look for love (repeat 4 times)

No innocence I can claim
No treasure of stolen hearts
In the mirror I look the same
A toy soldiers with missing parts

While he collects advances
Like thumbing through those dirty books
They estimate their chances
When the parking lot is empty

That your love will be true

It ain't ever gonna hurt anymore

You tell me I got out of line and I did
You think I'll never survive but I'll live
Let's break up that bound together
I'll use all my drastic measures
And leave while I still feel clever
So you can't hurt me anymore

Maybe all I want is to hold you right now with no compromise,

This is the real me, breakin' down at last,
Hey, it's the real me, crawlin' out of my past,
Baby, the real me, wants the real you, so bad

The numbness overcomes me now like alcohol and fear,
And I want to crawl inside you, baby, but I don't want you near,
A woman's her own mystery, not a shadow of her man,
But I'm not a queen inside a mirror no more,
I'm not a guard to hold hand,

Hey, it's the real me, crawlin' out of my past,
Baby, the real me, wants the real you, so bad

About you,

Into a runaway train

Long-distance phone calls, a voice on the line
Electrical miles that soften the time
The dynamite, too, is hooked on the wire
And so are the rails of American Flyers
Blind boys and gamblers, they invented the blues

We smile but the smiles we give are wanting.
We look upon each other's eyes, no spark
No glow, no real signs, but we both know
This is all for show

Until that sometime, somewhere,
We could show the world we have each other
Sometime, somewhere we need not hide out feelings,
We just keep on believing that we both have the time together
Sometime and somewhere, our lips would be free at last
You say the words we've hungered to say

And we won't have to worry, we smile we won't say sorry
One look and we have cast our fears aside.
Sometime, that sometime will turn to forever, for all time.
Somewhere, our somewhere would not be just one place,
But everywhere

Until that sometime, somewhere,
We just have to be content with stealing glances
Somehow, content with saying nothing, smiles that are
Always wanting. Though deep inside it hurts
Because we know that our love, like love,
Is what it is, it's what we got
Our love, like love will have to wait

And he never cared to make it dime

F. Scott and Zelda stayed here and you and me as well
At least that's how the story goes, the porters like to tell

A cold hard rain comes falling down
It wasn't like this last time around
There's no calm center to this storm
Oh baby, why don't you quit leaving me alone

There's nothing on the TV, no message on the phone
Nothing but an awful lot of nothing going on
And every radio station plays the same forsaken song
You'd think I would've had the sense to leave this place alone

Well some dreams die with dignity
They fade out clean and quietly
Some won't let you let them go
Ah baby, why don't you quit leaving me alone

Same old corner bedroom, seven stories up
That overlooks the window, that overlooks the gulf
The same old sleazy porter with the after hours stuff
I think I'll kick the walls around and beat myself up

Reaching for stars while we're standing on stools
Letting it go is jumping the train

Fame a substitute for friends

I'm given one more chance
So I change partners

Is gathered while we sleep

Renewed by my desire
Nothings left to chance

I'll change partners",Change Partners
Rosanne Cash,"We are awakened, restored, and renewed
The bonds of desire have led me to you
The heat of the questions that linger and stir
Is the fire that enfolds us, a place to be cured
Salvation and rescue
And the one thing of which I am sure

Your hand on my heart
And its beating in time
To the sound of your voice
And the look in your eyes
The moment you touch me
All down inside
Is the fire of the newly alive

The passion of old is a children's quick game
Now it's the sound of the thunder
And feel of the flames
You leave me a message so deep in my skin
Where you stop is where I begin

You are the reason, the time and the face
I am dissolving in oceans of grace
I'd give up a lifetime to keep you from harm

I'm gonna rise from the ashes

I feel inspiration when all may be lost
I claim resurrection no matter the cost
My moment of waking, darlin'

This is the place even angels don't understand
I've seen the disappointment in her face
And the collection of engagement rings on her right hand

She sits alone apart from the crowd
In a white dress she wears like a question mark
Friends speak of her fondly
Enemies just think out loud

You think you're man enough to please her
And you're fool enough to start
But you're not gonna do a thing to our little angel
There's nothing you're thinkin' tonight that tomorrow won't change

Now the cabaret is frozen
And the laughter comes in cans
And the lonely hearts club clientele
Don't know what to do with their hands

You think that you'll be sweet to her but everybody knows
That you're the marshmallow valentine that got stuck on her clothes
And you're not goinna do a thing to our little angel
There's nothing you're thinkin' tonight that tomorrow won't change

So you mix your drinks and words
You make bad jokes, you make bad time
The floors are there to walk over
The walls are there to climb

You swear you'll never go back again once you're inside
You're never the bridegroom she's always the bride
You're not gonna do a thing to our little angel
There's nothing you're thinkin' tonight that tomorrow won't change

You'll come in a sweetheart and you'll go out a stranger
Well, you try to love her but she's so contrary
Like a chainsaw running through a dictionary
So get your mind off the sweet behind of our little angel

You're not gonna do a thing
You're not gonna do a thing
You're not gonna do a thing to our little angel

Reassured by ads about things you own,
And so we go through this again,
In love, in love with your beautiful pain

You'd soon lose who you were
Oh, the pain and hurt, for that's your real,
So go on, go back to her

You packed up all your troubles, you let me play the bars
And hiked out to the meadows and lay down on the fragrant moss
Put down your own tree, then meticulously,
Built a cross right there and stared back at me
And climbed up on it again:

It's long been ignored, but it's not been completely in vain.
And all that I was, I gave that to you.
And if it's not enough, oh, there's nothing more I can do.

I guard the well to a century of tears.
I let them fall after hours and all through the years.
And all that I am as I stand here today,
Seems more than enough, there's nothing more I will say.

You had the laugh on me so I've set you free
And I'm movin' on

I told you baby from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
You have broken your vow and it's all over now
And I'm movin' on

But someday baby when you've had your play
You're gonna want your momma but your momma will say
Keep movin' on, you stayed away too long
Oh I'm through with you too bad you're blue
And I'm movin' on

That big eight wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true lovin' mama ain't comin' back
Cause I'm movin' on, I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high for my little sky
So I'm movin' on
Movin' on
I'll soon be gone",I'm Movin' On
Rosanne Cash,"Ten years ago on a cold dark night,
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall lights.
There were few at the scene, but they all did agreed,
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me.

The Judge said son, what is your alibi,
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die.
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life,
For I'd been in the arms of my best friends wife.

[Chorus]
She walks these hills, in a long black veil.
She visits my grave, when the night winds wail.
Nobody knows, nobody sees, 
Nobody knows, but me

The scaffold is high, and eternity near.
She stood in the crowd, and shed not a tear.
But some times at night, when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones

[Chorus]
Nobody knows, nobody sees, 
Nobody knows, but me

Oooo",Long Black Veil
Rosanne Cash,"I'm growing tired of the big city lights
Tired of the glamor, tired of the size
I'm always dreaming of roaming once more
Back to my home on the old river shore

Days are dark and dreary everywhere I roam
How I long for Mississippi and you
Nothing seems to cheer me under heaven's door
How I miss the Mississippi and you

Roaming the wide world over
Always alone and blue, so blue
I am sad and weary, longing to go home
Yes, I miss the Mississippi and you

Mockingbirds are singing 'round the cabin door
While I dream of Mississippi and you
And my memories are bringing happy days of yore
I have spent in Mississippi with you

Roaming the wide world over
Always alone and blue, so blue
Longing for my homeland on that muddy water shore
Yes, I miss the Mississippi and you

Wandering from room to room,

Said he didn't want to fight no more

Would I considered his amends
It's far too late your love has struck me blind
And now I can't go back to him

But a dream that has no chance will not come true

Passed by not long ago

He's always been that way.

And listens with her mouth

Got no time to see she's fed.

Es un viento que peina palmeras en el bulevar
Y en el centro es la mesa de un bar que añora al poeta
Cuyo vuelo a menudo se estrella en un suelo industrial

Mis viejos cantando a dúo alguna canción
Mi primer cigarrillo intentando sentirme más hombre
Para ver si lograba impactar a mi primer amor

Es el ciego Manuel delirando en un mundo de plástico
Con la magia que sus ballenitas suelen poseer

Un mendigo que cuenta estrellas desde algún umbral
El compás de un tambor que siempre sonará en mi alma
Donde el Topo Carbone jamás dejará de golpear

Rosario es el arte y su condena
Cuando sabe que la indiferencia lo va a perseguir
Y como tantas mis manos se hartaron de golpear las puertas
Y por no derrumbarme con ellas me tuve que ir

Rosario es ese invierno que partimos
Mi mujer, nuestros miedos, la vida, la música y yo
Y un dolor que crecía a medida que el tren se alejaba
Y unos ojos de almendra tratando de darme valor

Pero algo mío se quedo en sus calles
Hay un duende que en las madrugadas canta con mi voz
Y cruzando Echesortu aquel sueño de mi adolescencia
Que atrapó la leyenda de pablo El Enterrador

La pucha que es difícil la nostalgia
Pero es bueno si puede ayudarte a intentar ser feliz
Y es tanta la gente y las cosas que uno siente que ama
Que no existe tiempo ni distancia para estar allí

Me enseñó a ver a través del corazón
Y me dio un balcón para inventarme un cielo

Te quiero, te llamo a gritos, te necesito ay, ay

Soy como la brisa que al silbar 
Roza en tu pelo para llevar 
Tu olor por todo el firmamento 

Soy como el suspiro que al llorar 
Derrama lagrimas sin cesar 
Y que se sequen con el viento 

Y yo, se que no te acordarás de mi 
Y voy como una sombra detrás de ti, de ti 

Te quiero, te llamo a gritos, te necesito amor
Voy como ese agua que al beber 
Se evapora por tu piel 
Y se lleva el aire 

Sé que aunque tu cuerpo no tendré
Mil sueños siempre inventaré 
Y tu vivas en ellos 

Y yo, se que no te acuerdas de mí 
Y voy como una sombra detrás de ti, de ti

Rosario,"No hay nada igual
Que me guste más
Que una fiesta gitana
Me llevo tres días

Y hago lo que me viene en gana
Mi tía me cantaba
Cosas al oído
Que me hacían olvidar

Y me quitaba to' el sentio
Era un garaje
Y con luces muy mágicas
Y voces de princesas

Y colores que me raptan
Pieles de aceitunas
Cantes de mi raza, llores donde vive
Y ese duende que me canta a mí

Lerele, lerele, lerele

Vente conmigo
A escuchar este buen son
Que la sangre grité
Y llegué fuerte al corazón

Vámonos prontito
Que la fiesta empieza
Deja el relojito
Que el tiempo no cuenta allí

En ese garaje
Hay luces muy mágicas
Voces de princesas
Y colores que me raptan

Pieles de aceitunas
Cantes de mi raza
Flores donde vive
Y ese duende que me canta a mí

",Era un Garaje
Rosario,"Mira, como brillan las estrellas
Elige la que tu más quieras
Que para ti la conseguiré

Mira, aquellas nubes que están brindo
Para que llegues hasta el firmamento
Y formes parte del Éden

Porque aquella estrella, será especial
El mundo entero alucinará
De ver la estrella de la paz

Mira, esos planetas van diciendo
Que hay una estrella en el firmamento
Que brilla más que las demás

Mira, esos cometas que van viniendo
A presenciar el nacimiento
Que al mundo entero cambiará

Porque aquella estrella, será especial
El mundo entero alucinará
De ver la estrella de la paz

Porque si una sonrisa, hechas al viento
Para sentirte bien por un momento
Con este cuento soñaras

Mira, los arcoíris están haciendo
Ese camino hacia el universo
Donde su estrella encontrarán

Rosario,"Esos dos ojos tan negros
Dos ventanas frente al sol
Esas pestañas rizadas
Enredaderas de mi amor

Y quítamelo todo
Y quítamelo por favor
Revuélcame sobre
La arena de la playa

Llévame en tu ola
Donde allí pueda soñar
Dibújame esos
Castillos de corales

Enséñame el lenguaje
Del caballito de mar

Y quítamelo todo
Y quítame por favor
Envuélveme entre flores de colores
Y llévame hasta el cielo

Donde allí pueda volar
Enséñame esos paisajes de tus sueños
Y llévame hasta Venus
Y hazme reina del lugar

Y quítamelo todo
Y quítamelo por favor

Que calma mi sed

Y esas manos que deslizas
En mi piel
Mira el color del cielo y del mar
Nada es tan bonito como tu mirar

Y quítamelo todo
Y quítamelo por favor

Rosario,"Uh con una rosa me encontré
Sin darme cuenta sin saber porque
No pude imaginarme aunque trate

De ver su cara color miel y cuando la vea lloraré
Cuando la tenga entre mis manos sentiré
La esencia de la vida, lo puro de mi ser

La sangre de mis venas y mi ayer
Lo más grande que en la vida podré ver
La espera más bonita que yo tendré

El sueño de mis sueños, mi poder
El milagro de dar vida a este ser
Lo más grande de mi vida

Eah y eah y a esa rosa de mi vientre canto yo
Eah y eah y a esa rosa que me llenará de amor

Uh, ella será mi creación
Sus movimientos que me llenan de ilusión
Fruto del corazón de nuestro amor
Los dos unidos, nuestra continuación
Lo más grande que en la vida podré ver

La espera más bonita que yo tendré
El sueño de mis sueños, mi poder
Ese milagro de dar vida a este ser
Lo más grande de mi vida

Eah y eah y a esa rosa de mi vientre canto yo
Eah y eah y a esa rosa que me llenará de amor

Lo más grande que en la vida podré ver
Ese milagro de dar vida

Me hace correr mil kilómetros
Sobre la arena

Cruzados sin sentido

Por una espera que al fin terminó
Y aún me queda por vivir
Pero la magia seguirá aquí
Haciéndome sentir

Palabras que se funden
De un amor imposible
Caricias que en tus manos
Ahora son invisibles

Te quiero de colores
Fantasías dormidas
Que se han quedado atadas
Sin una despedida

Pero en tus ojos lágrimas de amor
Por una espera que al fin terminó
Y aún me queda por vivir

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

I put it down like a G supposed to
And show you something that only a G could show you
Makin' all the cheese leavin' mice with tofu
Young but I'm cool laid back and old school
Come here girl let me show you how to G Walk
And maybe after we could sneak off
Talent scout with a casting couch
If you ain't got no talent ya gotta get out
Let me rock the breezies one time
With my bump rhyme
I show them how to do the snake with they jaw line
I'm DP'ed out
With every piece of love in the club that could follow me out
And they all mine

[Chorus:]",It's That Time Again
Roscoe,"Now I'm so high, and I'm so fly
My kids on deck, and my beard ain't grow yet
I'm so on point; I'm so on one
This is how we do here in philaphornia
Young scoe Mack, toe back
The one ya'll love to blow back
I'll got five fingers, it ain't no riddle
By the only one showing is the one in the middle
Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the dog
Going at it over kittle out in the back yard
I drink yak hard, ya'll ack hard
Now I gotta touch up like a Mack card
Everybody packing a strap or spark
But don't everybody wanna strap or spawl
I'm ol' school with it, no tool with it
Head up til we feed up that's all
Smooth sailin'

You know you got me moving
I'll know you feel my music
I'll show my gs in fluids, All I do is spits fluids
I'm rolling, dipping, smashing
I'm throwing young assassin
I'm growing up will fast and
All I know is flow and rappin'
They call me young roscoe the Philly fanatic
Silly sporadic, dippin in traffic, grippin the matic
Sharp as a guillotine, still a teen
The California sun just beaming as I lean
Pull out my cigarettes feigning for nicotine
Straight of the Philly scene, Made for the silver screen
And I beam, my foot on the gasoline
Tell me I ain't the fliest M.C's you seen
And it's all smooth sailin'

Y. A. I Blaze
Step to us you get five days
I got four homies ain't none of them simple
Scold dizzle, known to make the microphone sizzle
Too many women after the Mack
I'm ma just kick one (What's Up)
We smash in my momma 'lac
Accurate with a maculate bash, The cake masher
Def Jeff let me borrow the keys
The great master
Young and I'm buck wild label as a luck child
Running them up wild laying hell of cuts now
I get the clubs shut down with this thug style
I puff clouds and touch crowds what now
Sick rhymes strict nines running thru my bloodline
Pedal to the metal with one time behind (Yeah)
My head spinning like a windmill
Rollin down the 101 counting dead bugs on my windshield
Smooth Sailin'

Young Sco Cal Holmes
We About to do it real big

Outside

[Verse 1: Roscoe]
I just rolled up in my Benzo
I just rolled up some of that you-know
I just popped out of nowhere like whaddaya-know
And I ain't going nowhere you know
y'all don't know half of my scenario
I got niggas all up in my cereal
And don't know if its Applejacks or Cheerios
y'all don't hear me though
It ain't no clothes in your ear to scope
See I just took over your stereo
18 year old college material
Puttin Philly on the map, philly on my cap
The imperial superior
And all the skirts want to give it to Sco
Till these shirts mix skirts want to give it to Sco
Stick works skinny work
But I'd rather have a fatter
If she pay em like she weigh em give it to Sco

[Chorus: Roscoe] 2x
See me my crew ain't- nothing but trouble
And we be coming through like- nothing but trouble
And niggaz tell us we ain't- nothing but trouble
Especially me I ain't- nothing but trouble

[Verse 2: Roscoe]
Yeah Philly in the house, Philly in this mount
Fitted on perfect, vest on the surface
I did it on purpose, fresh out the circus
I spit it so murderous, I'm crazy
Going through a tough time, got me sippin JD
Seeing in 3-D, see me in a G3
Coastin postin roast it toast it off
E & J G & J
I hit the VMAs with THC
All in my DNA I'm be	-A-D
Till the bone with the chrome
Once again its on
Club hoppin once we in the zone
We gonna BLAZE, GUZZLE, RAY, BUBBLE, SHIZZLE
Misbehave and start trouble
SPARK, CHUG, BARK, BUZZ
Dippin smashin why-A'in it up

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Roscoe]
I rock the party that rocks the body
Me Young Gotti we rock the party
Now we all in the cleezy no ideezy
Young Sco Gotti help me somebody
High loaded fly molded
Fry floatin shining glowing
Signing flowing rising blowing
Crackin poppin stackin dropping
Platinum product alive in your ride up
For all my survivors and riders
We gets wasted faded
Nice today enough for the rest of the night
Triple XT but my vest just right
Tech to my right with my neck full of ice
I'ma link up with you later, aight?
Take it or leave it I'm a playa for life

[Chorus]",Trouble

Intro:

Yeah, yeah, yeah (This is Scoedelic)
We don't play games
We take game to spray flames (Y.A.)

Hook:

Now what I look like?
Some type of lame or somethin'?
And look like niggaz thinkin' it's a game or somethin'?
Givin' me that look like what's your angle cousin?
I look left, look right, might be danger comin'

Verse One:

What I look like, if not a million dollars?
Bazillion stages and a billion hollas
What I look like, pushin' that new Impala?
Without 22's on it, is that a true baller?
What up with you baller? What cha bank book look like?
But here's another question: What I look like?
I been around the world Japan to Amsterdam
Spins around the world expandin' that's the plan
Radio Scoe with da radio flow
Rakin' in the dough, blazin' drough
What I look like anything less than three X's?
What I look like anything less than three Tec's?

(Hook: 2x, with variations)

Verse Two:

Now what I look like?
Eddie Cane or somethin'?
Like I don't spit flames or somethin'?
(The way you gratin on me)
Damn, it's like you know me by name or somethin'
Take a picture put it in a frame or somethin'
What I look like? A bird brain or somethin'?
I can see it in your eyes y'all came for somethin'
Your stories are all faulty, you're changin' somethin'
You must want some of my Mary Jane or somethin'
Numbskullz too much novocaine or somethin'
Get left with numb skulls migraines, concussions
And you can see it in me, Gotti trained me somethin'
Like Bin Laden Saadam Hussein or somethin'
I'm known for causin' spontaneous combustion
Constantly jumpin' through miscellaneous subjects
Actin' like you all insane or somethin'
Get wet like you ain't potty trained or somethin'

(Hook: 2x)

Verse Three:

What I look like comin' out droppin' floppin'
Girl what I look like, stoppin' and jockin'
You're best day you might catch me hoppin'
A 4 pancaking, no hand wavin'
Now here go the Feds, you know the routine
You see that blue and red, it ain't no red or green
Only a little lean up on the gasoline
Say hello to my little friend with the little beam
Now imagine me not saggin'
Not packin' a magnum
What I look like?
Now imagine me takin' a bad one
To the pad with no magnums
What I look like?
I can't imagine me gettin' out rapped
It won't never happen
Fool what I look like?
I keep it crackalackin'
I'm all about them plaques and figures
I'm a platinum nigga

I called you here today for a bit of bad news
I won't be able to see you any more
Because of my obligations
And the ties that you have
We've been meeting here every day
And since this is our last date together
I want to hold you just one more time
When you turn and walk away
Don't look back I want to remember you just like this
Let's just kiss
And say goodbye

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me till I'm through
This is something I hate to do
We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we done was wrong
Please, darling, don't you cry
Let's just kiss and say goodbye
Many months have passed us by
I'm gonna miss you I can't lie
I've got ties and so do you
I just think this is the thing to do
It's gonna hurt me I can't lie
Maybe you'll meet another guy
Understand me won't you try, try, try

I'm burnin' up, when you hear me on the radio, gonna turn it up 
It's the ulti-imitated, but never duplicated 
Wonderin' why these niggas hatin', but it's probably 'cause I made it 
And the top is such a lonely place,
Like everywhere that I go I can't help but to see a phony face,

Check me if I'm wrong for singing you this song

I wanna leave this girl I ain't feeling that

Are you never seen ? got your

This number after nine. Damnnit girl you're fine
And I be lying if I said I wasn't tryin to take your time
I know you probably been approached a thousand times
But I've seen guys who probably lied about their lies
And left you hangin' out to dry.
Well this ain't that type of story. My love is mandatory
And if I had a price tag, very few could afford me.
I'm mister call me when you horny. And I'll be there till the morning
Now every sentence with my name is so exclamatory.
I stand in the gas and glory she sing me a Spanish story
And she ain't even spanish. How unexplanatory.
She keep it wet like a storm and I drive her she ridin sports
See there's a first time for everything and you deserve a felon
Because shawty you a ten

[Chorus]
? you ain't' got to be ? pretend
Got my ? pretend
She says she never tried
And it'll be her very first time
Her very first time
Told her everything will be alright
Just buckle up tight and leave the rest to me
You ain't gotta worry bout a thing at all
Relax girl everything will be OK
I'll be the chauffeur I'm the one to call
Sit back, enjoy the ride, and lemme me do my thang.

I'm on it. Your boyfriends been demoted
I'm so potent shes so focused
Notions and my hocus pocus
I divide her what's the quotient?
And no I'm not her man but I'm the closest
Thing to her heart when I enter
I'm in her like a splinter
Dessert her after dinner I go sinner
Than I send her to a place that she ain't' never been
And now she stuntin' hard like they never did

[Chorus]",Very First Time

Roscoe Dash,"I have all the swag, body bag
Life’s a fucking party, I’m wasted, someone call a cab
Stumbling to the car but they keep asking for autographs
I’m going home with girls, girls, girls, yup, all of that
Tell me is it the fame or the money
Either way this people all think there must be something about me - stunning
Ah, everythang (I’m juiced up, I know the truth stuff)
'Cause everything I do is just actually too much
For y’all niggas
Oh yeah and I’m awesome over all niggas
Motherfucking dimes, I can’t even see you small niggas
So pardon me (please)
I don’t mean to brag
But I just spent 40,000 yen on these jeans I have
On baby
Oh yeah money long baby
You just  your makeup on the waistline of my draws
I mean oh you can be the inspiration for my next song
Just motherfucking do with me and bust jimmy johns
I’m the bomb dot com
Shout out to my moms
It's Been a long time coming and we still going strong
We win it, can’t let up
'Cause once these clowns forget us
It's gonna take a lifetime trying to make them unforget us
So I’m gonna represent us
From start and to the finish
I work hard to pay off
Ball - I gets the play off
You used to ball too, until you got laid out
Back in 95s damn I bet that's chaos
Life’s about lessons, sit back and watch me teach
Like a game of badminton, I’m so out of reach
I’m at the finish line, give my winning speech
It goes ""ahem , um""
But all y’all said I couldn’t do it
I hope every time you grab a … you forced to hear my music
You’re so cubic, I’m so coolest
Got your girlfriend playing nudest
I’m, with no script, but I don’t trip
Trust me I give a bat pri sa , means like aristocrat
No lady and the tramp but they were gifted cats we tripled that
I used to have problems, until I learnt to deal
I was taught to stay positive and always keep it real and I do
I do, I do, I do, I do
Oh, oh, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

Chorus :
I was taught to always keep it real it when I do
What I do, and I do, and I do, and I do, and I do (3x)

Do It

Stumble in the elevator, drifting down the highway
Drunk texed all my numbers, don’t know who the fuck is calling
Feeling extra reckless I could probably use some counseling
It’s a party at the condo, I don’t really feel like talking
Feel like killing the party and these hoochies in Air Jordans 
And pissing off all the bitches who wish that they could afford them, see um don’t brag a lot
'Cause when you, have a lot
You don’t, talk about it
You just, laugh a lot
And you just, walk it out, pop it out and stock it out, 
But ya'll bitter bitch ass haters don’t know what I’m talking bout
Do you? Cause I do
The best I can me and my crew - the best of friends
And the niggas that ride for me will put to sleep the best of me
And stay in your place, pass the ace, and put a smile back on your face
'Cause it’s a blessing to be next to the best dressed bitch up in this place
But I failed to mention that , um , I do this shit
While you other candy-coaters on that other .. box of goober shit
I rap  sing and do it on another box of .. shit
And if you ask my haters probably tell you I’m a super bitch
Yeah , uh huh, that's cause I do this shit 
'Cause I do it so right, and I do it so good
And I do it just like I said I would
'Cause I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I was taught to always keep it real it when I do
