Jacques Brel,"Une île
Une île au large de l'espoir
Où les hommes n'auraient pas peur
Et douce et calme comme ton miroir

Une île
Claire comme un matin de Pâques
Offrant l'océane langueur
D'une sirène à chaque vague

Viens
Viens mon amour
Là-bas ne seraient point ces fous
Qui nous disent d'être sages
Ou que vingt ans est le bel âge

Voici venu le temps de vivre
Voici venu le temps d'aimer

Une île
Une île au large de l'amour
Posée sur l'autel de la mer
Satin couché sur le velours

Une île
Chaude comme la tendresse
Espérante comme un désert
Qu'un nuage de pluie caresse

Viens
Viens mon amour
Là-bas ne seraient point ces fous
Qui nous cachent les longues plages

Viens mon amour
Fuyons l'orage
Voici venu le temps de vivre
Voici venu le temps d'aimer

Une île
Une île qu'il nous reste à bâtir
Mais qui donc pourrait retenir
Les rêves que l'on rêve à deux

Une île
Voici qu'une île est en partance
Et qui sommeillait en nos yeux
Depuis les portes de l'enfance

Viens
Viens mon amour
Car c'est là-bas que tout commence
Je crois à la dernière chance

Et tu es celle que je veux
Voici venu le temps de vivre
Voici venu le temps d'aimer

",Une Ile
Jacques Brel,"J'en appelle aux maisons écrasées de lumière
J'en appelle aux amours que chantent les rivières
A l'éclatement bleu des matins de printemps
A la force jolie des filles qui ont vingt ans
A la fraîcheur certaine d'un vieux puits de désert
A l'étoile qu'attend le vieil homme qui se perd
Pour que monte de nous et plus fort qu'un désir
Le désir incroyable de se vouloir construire
En se désirant faible et plutôt qu'orgueilleux
En se désirant lâche plutôt que monstrueux

J'en appelle à ton rire que tu croques au soleil
J'en appelle à ton cri à nul autre pareil
Au silence joyeux qui parle doucement
A ces mots que l'on dit rien qu'en se regardant
A la pesante main de notre amour sincère
A nos vingt ans trouvés à tout ce qu'ils espèrent
Pour que monte de nous et plus fort qu'un désir
Le désir incroyable de se vouloir construire
En préférant plutôt que la gloire inutile
Et le bonheur profond et puis la joie tranquille

J'en appelle aux maisons écrasées de lumière
J'en appelle à ton cri à nul autre pareil",J'En Appelle
Jacques Brel,"Derrière la saleté
S'étalant devant nous
Derrière les yeux plissés
Et les visages mous
Au-delà de ces mains
Ouvertes ou fermées
Qui se tendent en vain
Ou qui sont poing levé
Plus loin que les frontières
Qui sont de barbelés
Plus loin que la misère
Il nous faut regarder

Il nous faut regarder
Ce qu'il y a de beau
Le ciel gris ou bleuté
Les filles au bord de l'eau

L'ami qu'on sait fidèle
Le soleil de demain
Le vol d'une hirondelle
Le bateau qui revient

Par-delà le concert
Des sanglots et des pleurs
Et des cris de colère
Des hommes qui ont peur
Par-delà le vacarme
Des rues et des chantiers
Des sirènes d'alarme
Des jurons de charretier
Plus fort que les enfants
Qui racontent les guerres
Et plus fort que les grands
Qui nous les ont fait faire

Il nous faut écouter
L'oiseau au fond des bois
Le murmure de l'été
Le sang qui monte en soi

Les berceuses des mères
Les prières des enfants
Et le bruit de la terre
Qui s'endort doucement",Il  Nous Faut Regarder
Jacques Brel,"Pardon pour cette fille
Que l'on a fait pleurer
Pardon pour ce regard
Que l'on quitte en riant
Pardon pour ce visage
Qu'une larme a changé
Pardon pour ces maisons
Où quelqu'un nous attend
Et puis pour tous ces mots
Que l'on dit mots d'amour
Et que nous employons
En guise de monnaie
Et pour tous les serments
Qui meurent au petit jour
Pardon pour les jamais
Pardon pour les toujours

Pardon de ne plus voir
Les choses comme elles sont
Pardon d'avoir voulu
Oublier nos vingt ans
Pardon d'avoir laissé
S'oublier nos leçons
Pardon de renoncer
A nos renoncements
Et puis de se terrer
Au milieu de sa vie
Et puis de préférer
Le salaire de Judas
Pardon pour l'amitié
Pardon pour les amis

Pardon pour les hameaux
Qui ne chantent jamais
Pardon pour les villages
Que l'on a oubliés
Pardon pour les cités
Où nul ne se connaît
Pardon pour les pays
Faits de sous-officiers
Pardon d'être de ceux
Qui se foutent de tout
Et de ne pas avoir
Chaque jour essayé
Et puis pardon encore
Et puis pardon surtout
De ne jamais savoir
Qui doit nous pardonner",Pardons
Jacques Brel,"Il peut pleuvoir

Jacques Brel,"Les pieds dans le ruisseau
Moi je regarde couler la vie
Les pieds dans le ruisseau
Moi je regarde sans dire un mot

Les gentils poissons
Me content leur vie
En faisant des ronds
Sur l'onde jolie
Et moi je réponds
En gravant dans l'eau
Des mots, jolis mots
Mots de ma façon

Les pieds dans le ruisseau
Moi je regarde couler la vie
Les pieds dans le ruisseau
Moi je regarde sans dire un mot

Au fil du courant
S'efface une lettre
Lettre d'un amant
Disparu peut-être
Ah! Que je voudrais
Trouver près de moi
Une fille dont j'pourrais
Caresser les doigts

Les pieds dans le ruisseau
Moi je regarde couler la vie
Les pieds dans le ruisseau
Moi je regarde sans dire un mot

Et quand le crapaud
Berce au crépuscule
Parmi les roseaux
Dame libellule
Penchant mon visage
Au-dessus de l'eau
Je vois mon image
Moi, je vois, moi, je vois l’idiot",Les Pieds Dans le Ruisseau
Jacques Brel,"Il pleut
C'est pas ma faute à moi
Les carreaux de l’usine
Sont toujours mal lavés
Il pleut
Les carreaux de l’usine
Y en beaucoup d'cassés

Les filles qui vont danser
Ne me regardent pas
Car elles s'en vont danser
Avec tous ceux-là
Qui savent leur payer
Pour pouvoir s'amuser
Des fleurs de papier
Ou de l'eau parfumée
Les filles qui vont danser
Ne me regardent pas
Car elles s'en vont danser
Avec tous ceux-là

Il pleut
C'est pas ma faute à moi
Les carreaux de l’usine
Sont toujours mal lavés
Les corridors crasseux
Sont les seuls que je vois
Les escaliers qui montent
Ils sont toujours pour moi
Mais quand je suis
Seul sous les toits
Avec le soleil
Avec les nuages
J'entends la rue pleurer
Je vois les cheminées
De la ville fumer
Doucement dans mon ciel à moi
La lune danse
Pour moi le soir
Elle danse danse
Elle danse danse
Et son haleine
Immense halo, me caresse
Le ciel est pour moi
Je m'y plonge le soir
Et j'y plonge ma peine

Et c'est ma faute à moi
Les carreaux de l’usine
Sont toujours mal lavés

Jacques Brel,"N'est-il pas vrai Marie que c'est prier pour vous
Que de lui dire «Je t'aime» en tombant à genoux?
N'est-il pas vrai Marie que c'est prier pour vous
Que pleurer de bonheur en riant comme un fou
Que couvrir de tendresse nos païennes amours
C'est fleurir de prières chaque nuit, chaque jour?

N'est-il pas vrai Marie que c'est chanter pour vous
Que semer nos chemins, de simple poésie?
N'est-il pas vrai Marie que c'est chanter pour vous
Que voir en chaque chose, une chose jolie
Que chanter pour l'enfant qui bientôt nous viendra
C'est chanter pour l'Enfant qui repose en vos bras?

N'est-il pas vrai Marie?
N'est-il pas vrai Marie?",Priere Paienne
Jacques Brel,"Qu'avons-nous fait bonnes gens, dites-moi,
De la bonté du monde?
On l'aurait cachée au fond d'un bois
Que ça ne m'étonnerait guère
On l'aurait enfouie dix pieds sous terre
Que ça ne m'étonnerait pas
Et c'est dommage de ne plus voir
A chaque soir, chaque matin
Sur les routes, sur les trottoirs
Une foule de petits Saint-Martin

Qu'avons-nous fait bonnes gens, dites-moi,
De tout l'amour du monde?
On l'aurait vendu pour je ne sais quoi
Que ça ne m'étonnerait guère
On l'aurait vendu pour faire la guerre
Que ça ne m'étonnerait pas
Mais c'est dommage de ne plus voir
Les amoureux qui ont vingt ans
Se conter mille et une histoires
Ne brûlent plus les feux de la Saint-Jean

Mais nous retrouverons, bonnes gens, croyez-moi,
Toutes ces joies profondes
On les retrouverait au fond de soi
Que ça ne m'étonnerait guère
On les retrouverait sous la poussière
Que ça ne m'étonnerait pas
Et c'est tant mieux
On pourra voir
Enfin d'autres que les fous
Chanter l'amour, chanter l'espoir
Et les chanter avec des mots à vous
Qu'attendons-nous bonnes gens, dites-moi,
Pour retrouver ces choses
Qu'attendons-nous bonnes gens?
Dites-le-moi","Qu'avons-Nous Fait, Bonnes Gens"
Jacques Brel,"Tu n'as rien compris

S'il te faut des trains pour fuir vers l'aventure
Et de blancs navires qui puissent t'emmener
Chercher le soleil à mettre dans tes yeux
Chercher des chansons que tu puisses chanter
Alors

S'il te faut l'aurore pour croire au lendemain
Et des lendemains pour pouvoir espérer
Retrouver l'espoir qui t'a glissé des mains
Retrouver la main que ta main a quittée
Alors

S'il te faut des mots prononcés par des vieux
Pour te justifier tous tes renoncements
Si la poésie pour toi n'est plus qu'un jeu
Si toute ta vie n'est qu'un vieillissement
Alors

S'il te faut l'ennui pour te sembler profond
Et le bruit des villes pour saouler tes remords
Et puis, des faiblesses pour te paraître bon
Et puis, des colères pour te paraître fort
Alors

Alors, tu n'as rien compris",S'il Te Faut
Jacques Brel,"Il y a longtemps de cela
Au fond du ciel, le bon saint Pierre
Comme un collégien se troubla
Pour une étoile au cœur de pierre
Sitôt conquise, elle s'envole
En embrasant de son regard
Le cœur, la barbe et l'auréole
Du bon saint Pierre au désespoir
Qui criait et pleurait
Dans les rues du paradis
Qui criait et pleurait
Tout en se moquant de lui

Effeuillons l'aile d'un ange
Pour voir si elle pense à moi
Effeuillons l'aile d'un ange
Pour voir si elle m'aimera

Saint Pierre alors partit chercher
A cheval sur un beau nuage
Vainement dans la Voie Lactée
Sa jeune étoile au cœur volage
Au paradis, lorsqu'il revint
Devant la porte, il est resté
N'osant montrer tout son chagrin
A ses copains auréolés
Qui criaient et pleuraient
Dans les rues du paradis
Qui criaient et pleuraient
Tout en se moquant de lui

Effeuillons l'aile d'un ange
Pour voir si elle pense à toi
Effeuillons l'aile d'un ange
Pour voir si elle t'aimera

Mais le bon Dieu lui vint en aide
Car les barbus sont syndiqués
Il changea l'étoile en planète
Et fit de saint Pierre un portier
Et de ces anges déplumés
Par les amours du bon saint Pierre
Afin de tout récupérer
Il fit les démons de l'enfer
Ceux qui crient, ceux qui pleurent
A l'heure où naissent les nuits
Ceux qui crient, ceux qui pleurent
Dans un coin de votre esprit

Effeuillons l'aile d'un ange
Pour voir si elle pense à moi
Effeuillons l'aile d'un ange
Pour voir si elle m'aimera",Saint Pierre
Jacques Brel,"Sur la place chauffée au soleil
Une fille s'est mise à danser
Elle tourne toujours, pareille
Aux danseuses d'antiquités,
Sur la ville il fait trop chaud
Hommes et femmes sont assoupis
Et regardent par le carreau
Cette fille qui danse à midi

Ainsi certains jours, paraît
Une flamme à nos yeux
A l'église où j'allais
On l'appelait le bon Dieu
L'amoureux l'appelle l'amour
Le mendiant la charité
Le soleil l'appelle le jour
Et le brave homme la bonté

Sur la place vibrante d'air chaud
Où pas même ne paraît un chien
Ondulante comme un roseau
La fille bondit, s'en va, s'en vient
Ni guitare ni tambourin
Pour accompagner sa danse
Elle frappe dans ses mains
Pour se donner la cadence

Ainsi certains jours, paraît
Une flamme à nos yeux
A l'église où j'allais
On l'appelait le bon Dieu
L'amoureux l'appelle l'amour
Le mendiant la charité
Le soleil l'appelle le jour
Et le brave homme la bonté

Sur la place où tout est tranquille
Une fille s'est mise à chanter
Et son chant plane sur la ville
Hymne d'amour et de bonté
Mais sur la ville il fait trop chaud
Et, pour ne point entendre son chant,
Les hommes ferment les carreaux
Comme une porte entre morts et vivants

Ainsi certains jours, paraît
Une flamme en nos cœurs
Mais nous ne voulons jamais
Laisser luire sa lueur
Nous nous bouchons les oreilles
Et nous nous voilons les yeux
Nous n'aimons point les réveils
De notre cœur déjà vieux

Sur la place, un chien hurle encore
Car la fille s'en est allée
Et comme le chien hurlant la mort
Pleurent les hommes leur destinée",Sur la Place
Jacques Brel,"Les vieux ne parlent plus 
Ou alors seulement 
Parfois du bout des yeux,
Même riches ils sont pauvres, 
Ils n'ont plus d'illusions, 
Et n'ont qu'un cœur pour deux.
Chez eux ça sent le thym, 
Le propre, la lavande, 
Et le verbe d'antan,
Que l'on vive à Paris, 
On vit tous en province 
Quand on vit trop longtemps.
Est-ce d'avoir trop ri 
Que leur voix se lézarde 
Quand ils parlent d'hier?
Et d'avoir trop pleuré 
Que des larmes encore 
Leur perlent les paupières?
Et s'ils tremblent un peu 
Est-ce de voir vieillir 
La pendule d'argent
Qui ronronne au salon, 
Qui dit oui, qui dit non, 
Qui dit ""Je vous attends"".

Les vieux ne rêvent plus, 
Leurs livres s'ensommeillent, 
Leurs pianos sont fermés,
Le petit chat est mort. 
Le muscat du dimanche 
Ne les fait plus chanter,
Les vieux ne bougent plus, 
Leurs gestes ont trop de rides, 
Leur monde est trop petit,
Du lit à la fenêtre, 
Puis du lit au fauteuil, 
Et puis du lit au lit,
Et s'ils sortent encore 
Bras dessus, bras dessous, 
Tout habillés de raide,
C'est pour suivre au soleil 
L'enterrement d'un plus vieux, 
L'enterrement d'une plus laide,
Et le temps d'un sanglot 
Oublier toute une heure 
La pendule d'argent
Qui ronronne au salon, 
Qui dit oui, qui dit non, 
Et puis qui les attend.

Les vieux ne meurent pas, 
Ils s'endorment un jour 
Et dorment trop longtemps,
Ils se tiennent la main, 
Ils ont peur de se perdre, 
Et se perdent pourtant
Et l'autre reste là, 
Le meilleur ou le pire, 
Le doux ou le sévère,
Cela n'importe pas, 
Celui des deux qui reste 
Se retrouve en enfer.
Vous le verrez peut-être, 
Vous le verrez parfois 
En pluie et en chagrin
Traverser le présent. 
En s'excusant déjà 
De n'être pas plus loin.
Et fuir devant vous 
Une dernière fois 
La pendule d'argent
Qui ronronne au salon, 
Qui dit oui, qui dit non, 
Qui leur dit ""Je t'attends"",
Qui ronronne au salon, 
Qui dit oui, qui dit non, 
Et puis qui nous attend",Les Vieux

Jacques Brel,"Laat me niet alleen
Toe vergeet de strijd
Toe vergeet de nijd
Laat me niet alleen
En die domme tijd
Vol van misverstand
Ach vergeet hem, want
'T Was verspilde tijd
Hoe vaak hebben wij
Met een snijdend woord
Ons geluk vermoord
Kom dat is voorbij
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen

Lief, ik zoek voor jou
In 't stof van de wegen
De paarlen van regen
De paarlen van dauw
Ik zal al mijn leven
Werken zonder rust
Om jou licht en lust
Goud en goed te geven
Ik sticht een gebied
Waar de liefde troont
Waar de liefde loont
Waar jouw wil geschiedt
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen

Laat me niet alleen
Ik bedenk voor jou
Woorden rood en blauw
Taal voor jou alleen
En met warme mond
Zeggen wij elkaar
Eens was er een paar
Dat zichzelf weer vond
Ook vertel ik jou
Van de koning die
Stierf van nostalgie
Hunkerend naar jou
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen

Want uit een vulkaan
Die was uitgeblust
Breekt zich na wat rust
Toch het vuur weer baan
En op oude grond
Ziet men vaak het graan
Heel wat hoger staan
Dan op verse grond
Het wit mint het zwart
Zwakheid mint de kracht
Daglicht mint de nacht
Mijn hart mint jouw hart
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen

Laat me niet alleen
Nee ik huil niet meer
Nee ik spreek niet meer
Want ik wil alleen
Horen hoe je praat
Kijken hoe je lacht
Weten hoe je zacht
Door de kamer gaat
Nee ik vraag niet meer
'K Wil je schaduw zijn
'K Wil je voetstap zijn
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen
Laat me niet alleen",Laat Me Niet Alleen (Ne Me Quitte Pas)

Ik hield van jou
Tussen de torens
Van Brugge en Gent

Ay Marieke, Marieke
De tijd gaat gauw
Tussen de torens
Van Brugge en Gent

Zonder liefde, warme liefde
Waait de wind, de stomme wind
Zonder liefde, warme liefde
Weent de zee, de grijze zee

Zonder liefde, warme liefde
Lijdt het licht, het donker licht
En schuurt het zand over mijn land
Mijn platte land, mijn Vlaanderenland

Zonder liefde, warme liefde

Zonder liefde, warme liefde
Lijdt het licht, het donker licht
En schuurt het zand over mijn land

Woog zij te zwar
Van Brugge tot Gent

Op onze jeugd
Van Brugge tot Gent

Zonder liefde, warme liefde
Lach de duivel, de zwarte duivel
Zonder liefde, warme liefde
Brandt mijn hart, mijn oude hart

Zonder liefde, warme liefde
Sterft de zomer, de droeve zomer
En schuurt het zand over mijn land
Mijn platte land, mijn Vlaanderenland

Breng terug die tijd
Die mooie tijd
Van Brugge en Gent

Ay Marieke, Marieke
Breng terug die tijd
Van onze liefde
In Brugge en Gent

Dan lokken mij

Jacques Brel,"Men vergeet niets, neen niets
Men vergeet niemendal
Men vergeet niets of niets
Men past zich aan, c'est tout

Nooit een vaarwel aan land en thuis
Geen enkele reis ver weg van huis
Van vergezicht tot vergezicht
Van aangezicht tot aangezicht

Geen enkele kroeg waar men zijn pijn
In drank verdrinkt om vrij te zijn
Van al dat heimwee in het hart
En alles wat de geest verwacht

Want niemand of niets ter wereld
Is er die je vergeten doet
Wat er diep in het hart gegrond zit
Da's zo waar als de wereld rond is

Men vergeet niets, neen niets
Men vergeet niemendal
Men vergeet niets of niets
Men past zich aan, c'est tout

Geen 'k hou van jou, geen voor altijd
Geen woord van trouw, geen woord van spijt
Wat ons vervolgt waar wij ook gaan
Zijn stempel drukt op ons bestaan

Geen liefde die één enkele nacht
Wat licht en hoop in 't leven bracht
Maar die in de vroege morgen uren
Een waan bleek en van korte duur

Want niemand ook of niets ter wereld
Is er die je vergeten doet
Wat er diep in het hart gegrond zit
Da's zo waar als de wereld rond is

Men vergeet niets, neen niets
Men vergeet niemendal
Men vergeet niets of niets
Men past zich aan, c'est tout

Ook niet de tijd dat het verdriet
Mij duizend rijmen schrijven liet
Zelfs niet de tijd die ons vervreemdt
En rimpels voor een glimlach neemt

En 't grote bed ook zeker niet
Dat éénmaal rust en vrede biedt
En dat ook mij op zekere dag
Met wijd gebaar ontvangen mag

Want niemand ook of niets ter wereld
Is er die je vergeten doet
Wat er diep in het hart gegrond zit
Da's zo waar als de wereld rond is

Men vergeet niets, neen niets
Men vergeet niemendal
Men vergeet niets of niets
Men past zich aan, c'est tout

",Men Vergeet Niets (On N'Oublie Rien)
Jacques Brel,"Parlez-moi de la pluie et non pas du beau temps
Le beau temps me dégoute et m'fait grincer les dents
Le bel azur me met en rage
Car le plus grand amour qui m'fut donné sur terr'
Je l'dois au mauvais temps, je l'dois à Jupiter
Il me tomba d'un ciel d'orage

Par un soir de novembre, à cheval sur les toits
Un vrai tonnerr' de Brest, avec des cris d'putois
Allumait ses feux d'artifice
Bondissant de sa couche en costume de nuit
Ma voisine affolée vint cogner à mon huis
En réclamant mes bons offices

"" Je suis seule et j'ai peur, ouvrez-moi, par pitié
Mon époux vient d'partir faire son dur métier
Pauvre malheureux mercenaire
Contraint d'coucher dehors quand il fait mauvais temps
Pour la bonne raison qu'il est représentant
D'un' maison de paratonnerres ""

En bénissant le nom de Benjamin Franklin
Je l'ai mise en lieu sûr entre mes bras câlins
Et puis l'amour a fait le reste
Toi qui sèmes des paratonnerr's à foison
Que n'en as-tu planté sur ta propre maison
Erreur on ne peut plus funeste

Quand Jupiter alla se faire entendre ailleurs
La belle, ayant enfin conjuré sa frayeur
Et recouvré tout son courage
Rentra dans ses foyers fair' sécher son mari
En m'donnant rendez-vous les jours d'intempérie
Rendez-vous au prochain orage

A partir de ce jour j'n'ai plus baissé les yeux
J'ai consacré mon temps à contempler les cieux
A regarder passer les nues
A guetter les stratus, à lorgner les nimbus
A faire les yeux doux aux moindres cumulus
Mais elle n'est pas revenue

Son bonhomm' de mari avait tant fait d'affair's
Tant vendu ce soir-là de petits bouts de fer
Qu'il était dev'nu millionnaire
Et l'avait emmenée vers des cieux toujours bleus
Des pays imbécil's où jamais il ne pleut
Où l'on ne sait rien du tonnerre

Dieu fass' que ma complainte aille, tambour battant
Lui parler de la pluie, lui parler du gros temps
Auxquels on a t'nu tête ensemble
Lui conter qu'un certain coup de foudre assassin
Dans le mill' de mon cœur a laissé le dessin
D'un' petit' fleur qui lui ressemble",L' Orage (Le Ciel)

Jacques Brel,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando

Un jour, tu verras, on se rencontrera,
Quelque part, n'importe où, guidés par le hasard,
Nous nous regarderons et nous nous sourirons,
Et , la main dans la main, par les rues nous irons.
Le temps passe si vite, le soir cachera bien nos coeurs,
Ces deux voleurs qui gardent leur bonheur ;
Puis nous arriverons sur une place grise
Où les pavés seront doux à nos âmes grises.
Il y aura un bal, très pauvre et très banal,
Sous un ciel plein de brume et de mélancolie.
Un aveugle jouera de l'orgu' de Barbarie
Cet air sera pour nous le plu beau, l'plus joli !

Moi, je t'inviterai, la taille, je prendrai
Nous danserons tranquill' loin des gens de la ville,
Nous danserons l'amour, les yeux au fond des yeux
Vers une nuit profonde, vers une fin du monde.

Love is for love but only if it's meant to be (only if it's meant to be, baby)

I'm in love with a plain and simple girl (I'm in love)
She takes my heart and sends me for a whirl
I'm on the wings of love and I don't take care where I go (honey, I'm so in love)

Do it, do it, do it right, baby (I know you do it right)

I just love the way she makes love (I love it, I love it)
She gives me all she can as I feel its flow
Oh baby, her love is plain and simple and that's all right with me
Because it's so passionate girl, she makes me see

Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine

Quel heureux présage pour un aiguilleur du ciel
Tombé du lit fauché en plein rêve
Frappé par le glaive de la sonnerie du réveil
Tombé dans l'oreille d'un sourd
Qui venait de tomber en amour la veille
D'une hôtesse de l'air fidèle
Tombée du haut d'la passerelle
Dans les bras d'un bagagiste un peu volage
Ancien tueur à gages
Comment peut-on tomber plus mal

2. Tombé du ciel rebelle aux louanges
Chassé par les anges du paradis originel
Tombé d'sommeil perdu connaissance
Retombé en enfance au pied du grand sapin de Noël 
Voilé de mystère sous mes yeux éblouis
Par la naissance d'une étoile dans le désert
Tombé comme un météore dans les poches de Balthazar

Trafiquants d'import export

Tombés en haut comme les petites gouttes d'eau
Que j'entends tomber dehors par la f'nêtre
Quand je m'endors le c?ur en fête
Poseur de girouettes
Du haut du clocher donne à ma voix
La direction par où le vent fredonne ma chanson

Tombé sur un jour de chance
Tombé à la fleur de l'âge dans l'oubli

3. C'est fou c'qu'on peut voir tomber
Quand on traîne sur le pavé les yeux en l'air
La semelle battant la poussière
On voit tomber des balcons
Des mégots, des pots d'fleurs 
Des chanteurs de charme
Des jeunes filles en larmes
Et des alpinistes amateurs

Refrain

Tombé sur un jour de chance
Tombé par inadvertance amoureux

4. Tombé à terre pour la fille qu'on aime
Se relever indemne et retomber amoureux
Tombé sur toi, tombé en pâmoison
Avalé la ciguë goûté le poison qui tue

Jacques Higelin,"1. Sur le tapis de mon palace
Loin de Paris, loin de ses frasques
Je me pâme, je m'étiole
Je m'ennuie, je deviens folle
Qui me délivrera 
De mes fantasmes inassouvis
Mon mari est à la chasse
Mon majordome s'est fait la paire
Je reste seule devant la glace
Goûtant des plaisirs solitaires? Ah !!!
Je t'ai fait peur?
Ne me touche pas, n'oublie pas que je suis ta s?ur !
Ah quelle belle paire de miches
Mais, Bibiche, là n'est pas le propos : 
Ma poulette a claqué toute son artiche 
Et elle m'attend à la roulette au casino
Du fric, toujours du fric !
Tu ne viens jamais me voir que pour me taper
Suis-je donc moins désirable 
Que toutes tes misérables traînées ?
Oh, t'excite pas, c'est pas la question, allez
Aboule?
Sadique !
Le fric?
Salaud !
Si tu veux que j'me casse vite fait d'Monte Carlo
À une seule condition : vire ton smoking, ton n?ud papillon 
Car je sens?

Franchissons ensemble
Les frontières exquises 
De la décadence

À la prussienne sur le sofa
Dans les persiennes sur la moquette

Ah ! quel panard 
Ma belle canaille
Quelle pagaille
Dans le boudoir
Gestes obscènes qui m'obsèdent
Je résiste
Ah ! je cède
Montée brûlante de ma sève
Non pas encore, retiens-toi? 
Ah ! j'entends des pas
Dans le couloir
Cache-toi vite dans le placard
Bonsoir ma chérie, dans mes bras !
J'ai ramené ce trophée de ma chasse ah ah ah :
Une tête de vache avec ses cornes 
Je m'en vais de ce pas la ranger dans le placard
Non !
Et pourquoi ?
Je n'sais pas, je me sens lasse
Tu ferais mieux de t'allonger 
Pendant que je vais la ranger dans le placard
Non ! pas ce soir !
Écarte-toi, ah ! quelle audace ! 
Si tu ne veux pas que je me fâche 
Pour une tête de vache
Alors blonde passe passe passe passe toréador !

Valets volages et vulgaires
Ouvrez mon sarcophage
Et vous pages pervers 
Courrez au cimetière
Prévenez de ma part 
Mes amis nécrophages
Que ce soir nous sommes attendus dans les marécages

Voici mon message
Cauchemars, fantômes et squelettes 
Laissez flotter vos idées noires
Près de la mare aux oubliettes 
Tenue du suaire obligatoire

Lutins, lucioles, feux-follets, 
Elfes, faunes et farfadets
S'effraient d'mes grands carnassiers
Une muse un peu dodue 
Me dit d'un air entendu
Vous auriez pu vous raser
Comme je lui fais remarquer 
Deux, trois pendus attablés
Qui sont venus sans cravate
Elle me lance un ?il hagard 
Et vomit sans crier gare 
Quelques vipères écarlates

Vampires éblouis 
Par de lubriques vestales
Egéries insatiables 
Chevauchant des Walkyries
Infernales appétits de frénésies bacchanales
Qui charment nos âmes envahies par la mélancolie
Envoi !
Satyres joufflus, boucs émissaires 
Gargouilles émues, fières gorgones
Laissez ma couronne aux sorcières 
Et mes chimères à la licorne

Soudain les arbres frissonnent 
Car Lucifer en personne
Fait une courte apparition
L'air tellement accablé
Qu'on lui donnerait volontiers 
Le bon Dieu sans confession
S'il ne laissait malicieux 
Courir le bout de sa queue
Devant ses yeux maléfiques 
Et ne se dressait d'un bond
Dans un concert de jurons
Disant d'un ton pathétique
Que les damnés obscènes cyniques et corrompus
Fassent griefs de leur peine à ceux qu'ils ont élus
Car devant tant de problèmes 
Et de malentendus
Les dieux et les diables en sont venus à douter d'eux-mêmes
Dédain suprême

Mais déjà le ciel blanchit 
Esprits je vous remercie
De m'avoir si bien reçu
Cocher lugubre et bossu, déposez-moi au manoir
Et lâchez le crucifix
Décrochez-moi ces gousses d'ail 
Qui déshonorent mon portail
Et me chercher sans retard
L'ami qui soigne et guérit 
La folie qui m'accompagne
Et jamais ne m'a trahi

Tu peux toujours compter sur moi 
 
Et qu'une amie vienne à manquer 
Tu peux toujours compter sur moi",Je Ne Peux Plus Dire Je T'Aime
Jacques Higelin,"Écoute-moi mec, et reste en place
Juste le temps d'un face à face
Pas la peine de faire la grimace
Avale ta chique
Regarde-moi
Comme on se voit
Pour la première fois
Comme on se voit
Pour la première fois dans une glace

Avec ton air de tête à claques
Tes joues râpeuses comme un cul-de-sac
T'es tout l'portrait d'ton adversaire
L'?il aiguisé d'une vipère (oua oua)
Et la paupière
Couchée dessus
Et la paupière couchée dessus
Comme une panthère à l'affût

Balance-moi donc à bout pourtant
Une rafale de bons sentiments
Sors ton rictus, montre les crocs
Moi j'additionne tes chicots
Il est trop tard 
Il est trop tôt
Il est trop tard, il est trop tôt
pour mordre

Maintenant que je t'ai craché le morceau
Sors de ton ombre et garde-toi
Assez de jouer au plus fort
Pour que toi et moi n'en fassent qu'un
Il faut que l'autre
Reste pour mort
Il faut que l'autre reste pour mort
Sur le terrain

Des difficultés
Avec ma santé
Comm' tout l'monde
Des petits malheurs
Un coup dur par heure
Comm' chacun
J'me plains pas souvent
Et je vais d'l'avant
Comm' tout l'monde
Car j'ai découvert
Un truc du tonnerre
Comm' pas un...

Refrain 1
Dès que j'ai mis mon pyjama d'finette
Toute la nuit c'est l'cinéma, ma tête
S'envole
Je suis Tarzan, Michèle Morgan m'adore
Quand j'apparais les femmes supplient ""encore""
... sont folles!

Je suis statue, voyez mon socle
Je suis ministre avec monocle
Je suis acteur, je joue Sophocle
En toge
Je suis coureur automobile
Je parcours les déserts stériles
L'académie me trouve habile
Eloges

Au bord des toits, je me promène, la lune
Entre mes doigts, se change en thune
Je bois
Mais le matin, quand mon réveil résonne
Finie la fête, il n'y a plus personne
J'ai froid

Couplet 2
Samedi dernier
Je me suis soûlé
Comm' tout l'monde
Et je suis rentré
Un peu éméché
Mais très gai
J'étais fin perdu
Et j'y voyais plus
Comm' tout l'monde
Je me suis couché
Et là j'ai rêvé
Comm' jamais

Refrain 2
C'est pas mon lit, c'est pas mes draps, ça danse
Où est-ce que j'suis... qu'est-c'que c'est qu'ça... quelle chance
Une môme
Pour une fois je rêve à deux, c'est chouette
J'en avais marre de voir en tête à tête
Ma pomme

Des rêv's comme ça moi j'en réclame
Des rêv's en forme de bonn' femme
Avec des ch'veux, avec une âme
C'est bon
Plus besoin d'êtr' un homm' célèbre
Plus besoin d'aller chasser l'zèbre
Ou d'se démancher les vertèbres...
Trop long...

Et pis mon rêve, il a des lèvres roses
Des cheveux blonds il sent bon et il cause
Tiens, tiens
Fermons les yeux pourvu qu'il dure mon rêve
Moi j'en profite avant qu'il ne s'achève
J'suis bien...",Je Rêve
Jacques Loussier,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Jacques Loussier,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Will color all my dreams

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Jad Fair,"He was smiling through his own personal hell
Dropped his last dime in a wishing well
But he was hoping to close and then he fell
Now he's Casper the Friendly Ghost

He was always polite to the people who'd tell him
That he was nothing but a lazy bum, but
Goodbye to them he had to go
Now he's Casper the Friendly Ghost

Nobody treated him nice while he was alive
You can't buy no respect like the librarian said, but
Everybody respects the dead, they
Love a friendly ghost

And now they say we'll never forget what he learned
As we were mean to him but he never burned
Just singing, ""love lives forever!""

Oh, baby, how he puts you down

Here you ask and demand
In a place where they don't expect nothing

Is it a crime, is it a crime
For you to fall in love with Frankenstein
Is it wrong, could it be wrong

I told her me too you ain't saying nothing slick suck it and swallow
I just wanna hit you from the back and watch the Apollo
And if the pussy's all that I might holla tomorrow
But you acting like a rabbit how you cling to the carrots
It ain't the bling it's the nigga ma get it and stash it
Caught a coy, caught a flashback check this out
Bring your girlfriend in the room shorty and lick her ass crack
And even though your tongue stuck in her butt
The only thing I wanna know is we fuckin' or what?

[Chorus: x4]",F*****' or What?
Jadakiss,"All I want you to do is feel me,
Why take time out, to give you the real me,
Uh, uh, uh
Hey yo I grew up very athletic, hard headed
Thought I knew everything, wanted to do everything
I was spoiled, stubborn, the only child
So the only thing I could do was hold it down
Now this is something that I could tell you that's no bullshit
I always been wicked with the flow since a lil kid
My first addiction, GI Joes and icies
After that it was light skinned girls and Nikes
Breeze through junior high school, then high school
Couple of semesters of college and then night school
Moms start riffing, talking 'bout how she can't support a grown man
So the god start flipping
Pops used to say shit, but never to me much
Was like he wasn't even there 'cause we ain't agree much
Used to be gone for whole weeks at a time
Puffin one eleven, used to roll three out a dime
Then I found myself sleeping in late, doing nothing
Fucking, running with the niggas that was hustling
Shop wasn't open then, niggas was working for a pair of Jordans
The next two weeks they was broke again
Me and K keep havin talks of getting coke again
But the block was crowded we waiting for an opening
Meanwhile shit still slow we still flowing
Never stop or look back we still going
Bop passed the demo to Mary then she passed it to cousin
We thought it was on but it wasn't
And we can't blame nobody
Look at us now dog, we came in the game nobodies
Double are and Interscope, put that cake up
And we ain't go platinum but we made niggas wake up
Got 'em all talking 'bout pumping the brick
And they only go and see papi to get something to sniff
I'm 'bout to fuck the game up for real like in the World Series
Nigga that parachute down in the field
I don't rap I provide you bars
And the pain is invisible, but you can't hide the scars
So y'all never be on the level that we're on
Ability to have dope thoughts and spit heroin
I'm good just waking up
That's how I know I got one more chance to go and cash in and cake it up...",Feel Me (Skit)
Jadakiss,"[Chorus: x2]
I'm a gangsta
Yeah, motherfucker
I'm a thug
Uh, please believe
I'm a pimp girl
See man, let's go
And I'm a hustler, a hustler
Do it, do it, do it

Yo, I'm a gangsta, 'cause I do gangsta shit
Matter fact from now on call me gangsta Kiss
You already know I handle my business
Slay you then your man before the first candle's finished
Feel good when I walk through the hood
Best part is, I don't gotta flow I just talk to the hood
And I do a lot of reading, and only eat pasta
Shrimp fettuccine, and pine a la vaca
Came here talking slick, all that real shit
That's why I'm something to deal wit
Even though I wanted Gore to win
I can fuck with Bush though, cause he going let the raw come in
Bigger the boss, bigger the picture
Bullets is bisexual, 'cause they hit niggas and bitches
In a Deville with dubs in the back on a cell phone riffin
I'm all of the above just listen

[Chorus]

Yo, I'm a thug so I blow on weed
Get money like it grow on trees
Have all these hoes roll on E
Some of my niggas even stole on D's
Work 12 hour shifts, just gimme the word
I get 12 cowards hit, never giving a fuck
18's on the Coupe, deuce O's on the truck
Tell P hold the hammer while I handle the dice
Shoot him in his bandanna he ain't gambling right
I need a 360 Medina, charcoal gray
Treat my guns like my dogs, let 'em bark all day
In a three floor condo with the spiral stairs
Made it past the front desk, then the rifle's here
I'm the motherfucking big shot, I get down
Wit a 17, 16, 10 and a six shot
Fuck with Kiss get your wig rocked
And if you're smart you'll bounce when my motherfucking shit drop

[Chorus]

Yo, I'm a pimp girl
Catch me at the bar with a bottle of Cuervo
Mami's rubbing my webo
And this is what got me the ass
Honey said her drink was hot so I put my watch in her glass
Then she ain't even want to get breakfast
She just want to hop right up in the truck and get reckless
Top from the club all the way to the exit
Ask me her name, couldn't tell you if I guessed it
My bitches don't know nothing, don't say nothing
And they pay for everything, I don't pay nothing
I'm a white tee pimp, fresh headband
Dirty denim, Timberland, or a Nike pimp
I like to eat shrimp, and I don't keep a broad long enough to love 'em
Now dog that's some deep shit
Cause I don't believe in hoes exploring
No matter how bad you are you gone in the morning

[Chorus]",I'm a Gangsta

You know what it is. 

Real recognize real.
We've seen a lot of MC's come and go in this game,

Fuck why y'all niggas talking 'bout huh? (it's time I see you)
Get it right, you fagot niggas heard Suge Knight
Double are's the only niggas he respect and, why y'all niggas shook right?
Why y'all get on Hot 97 and, talk wit a baritone
Wit two niggas downstairs with licensed guns to take why y'all home
Scared ass niggas, you think they going take a life so they can get life [nope]
Ask Puff they ain't trying to hear that nigga
For no cake, and why y'all can get at us on Labor Day
We make stones that say ? your moms labor day
I'm in the hood so we can link up, any place you think of
Hand held don't hold prints plus I burnt the tip of my fingers
I'm a Bronx gangsta nigga, double are's hoodrat
The nigga they come get quick bitch, on this hood shit

[Cross]
Why y'all bitches think the riders a joke, well I don't play (let's go)
I blow you whole fucking shit up like Tim McVeigh
Gimme the needle, not tomorrow, but today
Cross coming why y'all better get the fuck out the way
I ain't the shit that you see that's on the top of your church
I put a bomb in your baby carriage, brick through your hearse

[Infa-Red]
Tell your CEO, don't call my CEO apologizing (sorry)
I'm at your wake in the choir standing harmonizing
It's Infa-Red the shit that be on top of the heater
The best thing in New York since Steinbrenner signed Jeter
Hold Camby sister the hostage, then send 'em a reef
So stop fronting vegetarian just scared of beef

[Eve]
Yo, hey suck my dick bitch, the way this chick spit ridiculous
Here we go again, only we on Kiss shit
We coming and you keep running
You keep claiming you the best that done it
Pussy let me see something
Fake niggas screaming ""Ryde or Die""
Same niggas we run up on and make 'em cry
Outta all the camps in this game, nigga
We the champs in this game
Who kick the real shit before the fame
Fuck you fat ass, fake bad ass niggas
Still play the hood while you ride past niggas
Coward trust me, we keep it gutter
Hope you stay mad a hater 'cause you can't touch us, huh

""It's time I see you""

[Styles]
Hey yo, I ain't got a care in the world
Kidnapping your kid, maiming your mom, and airing your girl
And like, you ain't got a care in the world
I'm hopeless and numb, I can't see but I can focus my gun
And I'm down for smoking blunts to the head
My nerves is shot, my paces is short, I dump in your head
I'm the hardest nigga out you outta know it by now
I'm the nigga that they talk about going to Chao
And my name ring bells, my blade stay bloody
If you heard about me beefing dog I leave the most shells
The nigga to salute, the quickest to shoot
Holiday Styles, motherfucker, giving you pound

[Sheek]
What? Like I won't run up and break your jaw
Like they make a vest for your head to stop the 4
I'm tired of rapping, let's get the mack and send niggas on vacation
Right in front of the radio station
Motherfuckers ain't quiet til the tech go off
Arteries hitted, hawkin, they neck is shit
I'm the motherfucking hardest
I smack the shit out of any one of your artists
Whatever the label
Why y'all niggas don't want beef, why y'all want meat at the table
And I don't give a fuck, Sheek'll do life in the box
Before any of why y'all bitch niggas front on the LOX
What? Motherfuckers, see man

[Jadakiss]
Yo, If I miss your head and your neck, I'll hurt your chest
If you from the streets betrayal is worse than death
And I'm known for getting money, not known for wildin
But I'm real I could rock both phones in the island
This is how we even the bets
I kill everything you love dog, right now, even the pets
Everything got dubs on it, even the vets
50 close, then 50 wide, even the sets
Cause the bullets is like calisthenics when I'm squirting
When they start hurting, that means they working
Only way we coming is hard
Industry is like jail nigga, double are's running the yard, uh",It's Time I See You

Still dating your heat,but me and my guns alope
Wen I die burry me with the toats
Just in case I run into a lil bit of drama where ever I go
And I won't hesitate make you levitate
Hit you with the titanium 38
And its featherweight
Bullets like good dope
High will keep em coming
Kill a couple niggas then everybody want em
Who gonna shoot and who gonna brawl
If push come to shove everybody know you gonna fall
And I got mine on me
The automaty or the forty cali or even the black glock nine homie

[Jadakiss]
I got a gun with two hundred shots
I'm the reason you moved your family to a hole new other block
I got shit that could wake up the deaf
That will knock down the door and break up the steps
Don't even bother wearing a vest
'cause these ain't the type a slugs that'll get lodged in your chest
Got a night time scope that can see through the walls
So just to get shit cracking i'ma tear up you're dog
I'ma show you whats dumbing out
And you can believe whatever I shoot is coming off or coming out
And don't even try running out
'cause the 44 mag will leave you're ass by another house

The guns and the sneakers made jada
The bitches and the refer came later 
With the money and the haters
But ima humble kid
Still put the pump in your baby mother mouth make her mumble where you live
25 years no felony I'm telling y'all
Why you think I saved it, to blow a nigga mellon off
As a young boy always carried the cap gun
And fell in love with it first time I clapped one
Now I'm a grown man more mature and pleasant
And like hitting niggas in the jaw with the dessert
And everybody gotta gun why not me
You gotta keep it on you now its just like I.D.
And I never seen a man cry till I seen a man shot
Fuck pride bullets is too damb hot
So if you ain't got one you gotta run
Handle it 
Or tell the whole world that 

Jadas got a gun
All the hating in the world can't save ya
Jadas got a gun
And all the money in the world can't save ya

Anything you want to do you could do ya know what i'm saying baby?
No matter what though, gotta keep your head up to the sky

[Jadakiss]
This goes out to, all the infants
in this cold world that was born addicted
And to all the section eight kids
Just remember these four words y'all, we goin' make it
The government keep on trying to fool us
The system, keep on trying to lose us
And all we can do is keep buying computers
And ? all now 'fore it start going down
We gotta hold our head, keep our pride
Though it hurts when I see people sleep outside
Little babies with no socks on, eating popcorn
We all know what they moms and they pops on
Out go the love when the drugs come
They never got nothing for Christmas, and they ain't Muslim
This is a jewel, a lot of us was them
This is a jewel, a lot of us was them

Uhh, to my lockdown niggas keep your head in the sky
To my shot down niggas keep your head in the sky
I don't know if it's better to ride, or better to die
And that's why there's red in my eye
Cause people don't know what the ghetto is like
Either you make it out, or the terrible life
I don't want to be a broke bastard
And everybody in the hood got somebody in they fam' with a coke habit
You work for minimum wage
I'ma get in the game, get shot or a bid in the cage
It's a risk I gotta take - and I'ma be the nigga
with the bricks and the stash and the biscuit outta state
And even though I'm blessed with the gift
I gotta move cause the pain and the sickness gotta wait
I go extremely hard - why let up?
And I can breathe long as I keep my head up

[Chorus] 

[Jadakiss]
Hey yo I come from a place where it's three strikes out
And your life's on the line, so we iced out
Summertime getting money, three dice out
Tanktops, and jean shorts, we Niked out
Headbands, and four wheelers
Jeeps and Coupes and convos, about who know more killers
It's all wrong but it's all right
It's a small world, matter fact it's a small life
We all trip but the way to survive
is hold your head and make sure you fall right
And it's a quite fact, that whatever goes around comes right back
It's just like that
And we tryin to touch major paper
Everybody in the struggle it gets greater later
Never say can't, it's better to try
And you can breathe long as you keep your head in the sky

Still in the hood doing it
I don't know why I'm doing this, we don't eve move a lot of units
But ain't no threats, don't stress me dog
You gotta let me hear something to impress me dog
When I spit I put rappers in line, then smack 'em around 
I got 'em all home practicing now

You might hear clips spitting, we after your glow
Things'll never be the same again
When your frame get bent, link get worn, change get spent
Confiscate your whip, you think you a player?
I could confiscate your bitch, take her and slay her
If a nigga nicer than me, then Christ is here
You got something in the bank? Then the dice is here
I could show you how to gamble your money, handle a gun
But be a family man and go home to your son
Light a candle where you stand, cause that's where you died
And if you heard Kiss spitting, then you know it was won, uh

You could put your jewels on it
You might just see me in the lightning pickup with the 22's on it
The stakes'll cost you, understand one thing
I do great field work plus I'ma boss too
Loyalty is hard to come by
Why y'all know who the streets is run by, could only be one guy
And that be who but 'Kiss, no security
The burner and some niggas that I grew up with
And the brand new 911, fuck a dime
With a fine eleven at stop signs I'm revving

I'm taking it right there, they leave me no choice

She said she was a model for a year and a half
And if she took her pins out,
then her hair would drop down to her calf
I knew her man, he was just up North
and would've got left up North, but he was the chef up North
Anyway I'm K-I-double
All I do is get dough, spit flows, try to stay out of trouble
If you ready we could move, just lose your man
or hit the dance floor, I'll show you how to do my dance
Or I might let you play in the garden
Or sit up in that white thing and listen to the greatest of Marvin
The estate got six locations
Take so long to get to the front once I missed probation
And I hate to brag
I know ya man really wouldn't like the Baretta but he'd hate the Mag
And yeah here go a blank check, rock yourself out
But in the mean time girl, knock yourself out

Oh you modelin momma? (knock yourself out)
Wanna let ya hair down? (knock yourself out)
Oh you ready to move? (knock yourself out)
Whatchu wanna sit in the Coupe? (knock yourself out)
Wanna keep on dancin? (knock yourself out)
Wanna run in my mansion? (knock yourself out)
Sit in V.I.P.? (knock yourself out)
Bitch you just wanna be seen (knock yourself out)

Now you can knock yourself out like you boxin yourself
Or you can get real freaky start poppin yourself
And my watch got so many rocks, when you look at the time
it's sorta like you watchin yourself, uh
Front if you want, I puff a few blunts
and take a cruise in a Porsche wit the trunk in the front
She had the Jocko Bijou sandals, told her hop in
The coupe blew her mind when she couldn't find the door handles
Attitude very high maintenance, check this out ma
I'm runnin out of my patience
Don't sleep wit me? Then don't speak wit me
And never talk bad bout niggas that eat wit me

Wanna let ya hair down? (knock yourself out)

Aiyyo, honey know I'm waitin to leave
Keep dancin, cause I like how that ass shake in them capris
I'm like Big wit the murder mamis up in Belize
but I'll still fuck a chicken head like Lil' Cease
I don't care if they model, bet they all gon' chill
First nigga to cook base on a Foreman grill
And you might win some, but you just lost one
Kiss mis-educates 'em like Lauryn Hill

Oh you modelin momma? (knock yourself out)
Wanna let ya hair down? (knock yourself out)
Oh you ready to move? (knock yourself out)

I need a good girl
I need a good girl

Eyes all chinky
She be coming through in the new Cadillac Escalade on twinkies
Ma got a perfect face, brilliant ass
Her hands and her feet look like a mill in cash
I love when I call and she still in class
Instead of down in Bloomingdales stealing bags
And you know ya man Jada shoot through the hood
She look so good that the chickenheads can't hate her
Ever seen a dime? she a hell-a one
Still make her hop out and cop me a dutch, a vanilla one
Taught her how to murda the highway
Put her up on mean shoes like Roberto Cavale`
Even though she look real ill in the Gucci
Now you might catch her in Amilio Puchi
Since she a good girl that attend college
I don't let her give me brain I just let her give me knowledge

[Chorus: x2]
She's a good, good, good, good girl
Such a real fine lady and a lucky girl
I don't want no nasty girl

G-class 5, the seats go sideways
Wit the see-through roof, oof!
Rims so big they leave dents in the highway
My good girl ride wit me
She take over the wheel everytime I pull over to piss
She shake it up in the club when I'm over them hips
Waking up to the turkey bacon over the grits
Orange juice and the newspaper over the clips
Later on she gon hook up spaghetti
She ain't worried 'bout Herm S shit she got it already
She said she knew about the game cause her father was heavy
Then she asked could she borrow the Chevy
I could zoom in the jag
She going shopping need room for the bags
I sped off in the joint like it's Raspy's world
'Cause (I don't want no nasty girl}

[Chorus]

She's a good girl, I love her for that
She got mad dough, I love her for that
Her moms is cool, I think her lil' brother a rat
Everything else is straight though other than that
She don't play no games, I love her for that
Or hang wit no dames, I love her for that
I told her roll for dolo, leave the chicks
Attitude, reflex leadership
And the sex is incredible, I love her for that
How she fit me in her schedule, I love her for that
And she like making love by the lake for hours
Or just chillin' on the block, on a crate for hours
This Jadakiss, and Timbaland
This is Raspy's world

None of y'all better
""Ain't none of y'all better""
If it is name it
We'll squash you, ASAP, feel it

All I know, niggas give me all my dough
Like Boston George coming through with all my blow
Right now I'm trying to charter a jet
Fuck this hit the Panama Canal and get a harder connect
Step on your toes, mess with your hoes, shoot up your mans
Come through the block trying to screw up your plans
Cause I still rob niggas for coke
Understand I'm the first one they call when they gettin the dope
I'm the one who prick your finger when they give you the oath
I'm the one who made the hit when they bring you the toast
Like Pacino and DeNiro 'cept they call me Paniro
Sad Styles still spin that arrow, fuck it
Like the boss of New York, you know how I feel
Kill a motherfucker cause a corpse don't talk (no doubt)
Sixteen in the joint wit one in the head
If the bullets had legs have them run in your head, bitch

[Chorus]
Int none of y'all better
What y'all know about
Put in my work
On the block
Aint none if y'all better
But you know it's all real
Is it real? Yeah son!
Aint none of y'all better
What y'all know about
Put in my work
On the block
Aint none of y'all better
""bet you know it's all real
Is it real? Yeah son!
Ain't none of y'all better

[Sheek]
Let's get it popping my nigga
Load the tech up and go shopping my nigga
And I don't mean the mall or no Gucci store
You know what the fuck I want, bricks of raw
And I'm too old to make less than a hundred a year
If it means waving the hammer and leaving you there
If it means grabbing your kids out daycare
Somebody losing a seed, pay or bleed
It's Sheek Louch, I ain't got no heart
I shoot broad daylight right in front of the mark
I put 28 holes through the icy car
Fuck around, like the God won't squeeze
If I don't see the badge I'm clapping the D's
LOX motherfucker, the OX motherfucker
The reason why you shouldn't cop drops motherfucker
Like it's something for me to shoot your pops motherfucker, what

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Ayo the dopes and the rice, the cokes and the Pyrex
Over the stove and I'm bout to hit it with the ice
Runners love to pump the bomb
They know no fair ones, now niggas'll jump they moms
You god, minus the 12 disciples
I pop up, all you see is shells and rifles
If I don't like you, I'ma kill you not fight you
I bite a little piece of your ear off like Mike do
And everybody gon' follow me now
Down eighth and an Uzi mahogany brown
Fagots want you to kill 'em in a hurry
It fucks me up, like they aint got no money to get buried
You could flip, I'll survive m'kay, motherfucker
In my block still doing twenty-five a day
Know you work out, chest and your back all nice
But the twelve gauge'll have your six pack on ice, what?

[Chorus]",None of Y'all Betta

Aiyyo Swizz check it out
I'm shoot over to Cali, you know what I'm saying? Check this movie out
Then I'ma check honey out
Then I'ma fly back to N.Y., see what's going on in the projects
Then I'ma shoot down to Atlanta
See how it's going down in the Dirty Dirty
Then I'ma shoot over to New Orleans, Detroit, Chicago, Seattle, Miami

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
I'm on my way to Cali to see my bitch (say what?)
I'm on my way to New York to see my bitch (that's right)
Down in Atlanta done seen my bitch, now
I don't know, what you've been told
But I'm on my way to Philly to see my bitch (say what?)
I'm on my way to Texas to see my bitch (that's right)
Down in Miami done seen my bitch - now
I don't know, what you've been told

[Jadakiss]
But I'm on my way to Cali to see my bitch
And do a movie but first I gotta read my script
After that I get it popping at the La Mentage
I'm getting skull in the Ferrari, bottom garage
Then it's back to N.Y. to my project bitch
She like to do it anywhere, a real hard head bitch
And she enjoy riffing when I'm gone
But love when I say I'll be there in a minute, listen for the horn
I'm down in Atlanta to see my bitch
She go to college, she model, and she got chips
Rock La Pearl lingerie
Tattoo on her ass that say that this belong's to Ja'
Now I don't know, what you've been told
But 'Kiss be blowing they mind and spending they dough
And I'm going on a lil' trip, I'll be back
Anybody looking for me, just tell 'em that I'm

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
I'm on my way to New Orleans, for one whole month
To see my shorty in Magnolia, she got gold fronts
We don't kiss; matter fact I only hit that once
But she chill and she like to smoke big fat blunts
Then I'm swinging through Detroit to see my boo
You think you got every color mink? She got two
And she just slapped a hundred on the
Honey was a gangstress for real, getting money off the board
Then I'm hitting Chi-Town, soon as it die down
Lay up in my chick's house, break a couple pies down
Nobody can do this but 'Kiss, freeze
Music please
Where was I? Oh yes
Off to the Valley so I gotta go West
My chick got the gold Benz and the gray Lex
I hit her with a shirt on cause she got fake breasts, see man

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
That I'm on my way to Philly to see my bitch (yes)
She talking shit on the celly like she that bitch (yes)
And this how you know it's definitely real
When you drop the CL-6, then you knock Stephanie Mills
When I get there, she goin' show me more than some brotherly love
Top piece till I cum in her mug
I'm trying to leave and she giving me hell
Told her bend over, I'ma crack that ass like the Liberty Bell
Now I'm on my way to Texas to see my bitch
I ought of be there by breakfast if I leave by six
And ain't nothing stopping Ja'
I'ma get the puss, catch the Rockets game, then be on my way
Now I'm down in Miami to see my bitch
She got her own beauty salon, and she strip
I'm proud of the girl, backside's out of this world
The bitch perform, besides that, her lips was warm, see man

[Chorus: x2]",On My Way
Jadakiss,"Turn the fuckin beat on!
Ha!! Yeah, we back! ?
I had to switch back to Dom Perignon in rap baby!
Cock-and-run to stay in the business
Son of a bitch! Double R, look at me now motherf
Two-thousand-and-one, ""Kiss the Game Goodbye"" let's get it on!

[Jadakiss]
It's the J-A-D-A I got beef with the feds and the D-A
I got footage in the game press replay
I got bitches in the club all over me ma take it e-asy
And y'all scared I can tell
and I'ma get Buckss like Milwaukee cause like Sam I Can-sell
I'm that nigga y'all know that
Bang you in the yard then slide off on the early go back
In the streets I flash the cannon like Kodak
And I spray threes so say cheese
Already told you I'm looking for enemies
Double R so of course it's better
I love cornrows and Farrah Fawcett feathers
It's a message in a glass bottle read the letter
Money in the bank membership Visa sweaters
And we ride or d-i-e together

[Chorus]
Uh uh come on put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that put ya hands down
Come on put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that put ya hands down

[Jadakiss]
Y'all know I got the master flow, fast or slow
Y'all wanna know who the best is aks ya hoe
The honies don't lie they love it
And they cop for real trust me dogg the thugs will dub it
'Kiss hit you with consecutive hot shit
Therefore nobody never gon' spit like I spit
Get money just to walk through off the books
So when you mention my name shit is off the hook
Shirts is off, titties is out
And you know I'm there the hardest niggas in the city is out
I'm in the club ice over the thermal waitin for you to try me
When the lights get low I'ma burn you
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Flirt with the hood rats then pop models
Gotta slay two or more, ma that's our motto
And y'all might get down with the team if y'all swallow

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Kiss the game goodbye, the game is mine
You thought wrong change ya mind
I'm the nigga that'll pop the king and scoop the queen
and take over the town with a ruthless team
New S-Type wagon, future green
Gun heavy pants sagging I'm used to cream
Who you know can make a million dollar bail on cash
Never did a day and got the jails on smash, K-I double
I move the perico quick, and just let manteca bubble
'Kiss been a boss, y'all just start working
Now put ya hands up 'til ya arms start hurting
Don't put 'em down 'til I tell you
Whoever wanna be hard headed then find out what the shells do
Now you can put 'em down if you want 
But soon as the hook come back put 'em up

[Chorus]",Put Ya Hands Up
Jadakiss,"[Jadakiss]
Yo!
Yo, yo, yo, yo, hey, yo
Never will it stop
Hang guns with double digit shots
I move work on other niggas blocks
Leave out the club wit a another niggas watch
Body that man and let other niggas watch
Only thing worse than a coward, is a coward with power
Gotta kill him in the shower, hour
Beats is knocking, hooks is rare
Earned my spot, nobody ain't put me here
Burnt my block, I had a fiend cooking with beer
Like the Bobby Wilmack of crack
Might see me in the Burgundy thing, or the black on black
Matter of fact, go get ya chrome
Cause I rather be, broke together than rich alone
Clapping em' down, backing em' down (uh)
Fuck what ever happened before, I'm what's happening now

[Chorus: Nas (Jada)]
Now gangstas live, gangstas die
Grab ya guns, soldiers ride (show discipline nigga!)
Kill ya moms, kill ya pops, kill ya seed
Kill ya girl (Its principle nigga!)
Sell ya crack, sell ya coke
Sell ya E, sell ya smoke (you hustling nigga!)
Grab ya nine, grab ya pound
Grab ya tec, grab ya pump (you busting at niggas!, what)

[Nas]
We brave hearted, I had bitches trying to poison me
Niggas who kilt loyalty
Set me up, vested up my move accordingly
I ducked icepicks and ice sticks by cops who rookies
Hard to be righteous, and when life can just stop for pussy
Niggas killing over hoes, guns concealed in their clothes
Bodies at funerals, touch them they feel like they froze
Speech, totally calm, holding dead rappers ? in my palm
Burning flag, plus its on the qu'ran, its on the bible
Plus America cause that every car that's driving
Holding the ? you focus you know its Nas then,
Prince of the globe, leave no prince of the toast
Played with Ouija boards, burned frankenchise with a ghost
I've learned, to do good plus a waste of evil
And do what it takes to keep a smile on the face of my people
I was raised by the apes in this dark creep show, but yo

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Think bout when I splatter ya mask(yea)
My niggas is happy, ya momma is sad
If ya niggas is riders, the drama will last
If ya niggas is snitch, been judging my ass
They said I'm too famous to run
So when I empty out this clip, I'm changing the gun
The realer the beef, the longer the clip
Murder ya mans, I'm gone in the mist
Call this girl after dark so we talked the bitch
We ain't care cause the whore wasn't shit
Doll, I ain't taking the L or wasting a shell
I bring the heat like I'm Satan itself
Fuck if you hard, fuck if you soft, long as you lost
Dick in the dirt, shit in ya drawers
Ill make ya grandmother get on the floor
Tie you up, then beat you to a pulp, say that this is a war
If in the four, mackign a pump, acting I dump
Throw you out the window then act like you jump

I only gave you the crown so I could shoot it off your fucking head
Why y'all niggas fucking dead, you heard what the fuck I said
I talk shit cause I walk shit, start shit, New York shit
The hawk shit, spark shit, the dark shit
And it been that way, fuck how a nigga live it's gon' end that way
Niggas is part of a game that I don't play
Never catch dog carrying what I don't weigh
That's three 45s, one 38, 173 pounds straight out the gate
I don't hate, got no beef but knock a nigga off quick
And I'm mad like a bitch and a nigga with a soft dick
Get off this, fucking with X, but on some other shit
Why the fuck you fucking with X? You must be fucking with X
Go catch a chicken, fucking with me you goin' catch a whipping

here we go again [Repeat: x8]

[Jadakiss]
Look don't try to apologize on your two way
Sympathy don't amuse me, go get your uzi
And let's make a real movie
Play bad guy and good guy til the hood die
Toast why y'all cowards
Now I know the reason why Pac ain't really like most why y'all cowards
I'ma show you how to swing the chrome for real
Dog this year we goin' bring it home for real
What you want to bet the llama'll squash you
I been had a white fan base before the signing of Marshall
Boy Kiss is thorough, hit your girl
Put it all up her stomach til she earl
Why y'all niggas ain't nice ya lucky
So fuck it I'ma sell dope long as the price is lovely
And it ain't only the voice it's the bars of death
DMX and Jadakiss nigga guard ya chest

When is they getting off our dicks, them niggas is clowns
How many dogs you let go up, still getting down
Like 'face said, last of a dying breed
For stomach and I feed still trying to eat
Lead by greed that's when you fuck up
Why y'all niggas gonna know when we hungry, you get stuck up
(What what?)
What's up? Fuck a nigga yelling
Why-O motherfucker for real, yo Kiss tell 'em

[Jadakiss]
Sheet could kill, stomp niggas out boot the grill
I'll give you a reason why I'm the truth for real
Niggas can't fuck with Kiss, I mean that
Had to stop eating red meat cause I ate too many Beanie-Macs
I'm not one of them niggas and since you so righteous
Don't make me send your ass to Ala quicker
Niggas gas you to force your hand
Realistically you just a worker and your boss is my man

Jadakiss,"Fuck the frail shit
'Cause when my coke come in
They gotta use the scale that they weigh the whales with

Carlssons on the jeep, Bugatti made the prototype
Hoped you'd get the picture but you just can't photo life

Determined niggas make it
Kicking down the door and we burning niggas naked

The house costs a million, sitting on the beach
And the only thing I know, if it's furnished I'mma take it

My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
We got the shit that the government got
Talking money then you rubbing the spot

Real niggas say that they be wilding
We on the Cayman Islands
On a yacht with our favorite albums

A bad ho and a plate of salmon
Smoking and drinking, nigga is you thinking that our fate is violent?

I love my nigga for the fact that he real
And nobody on the faculty squeal

And if you facing capital pun', pass me a gun
And I'mma give you time to run while I rapidly peel

We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it

We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it

We gon' make it

I learned the game quickly, and I don't like to rent
So when I fly now, I bring my cars on the plane with me
In this case who's the loser?

Ran through enough coke for Castro to build schools in Cuba
Teaching kids how to read and write and use the Ruger

Motherfuckin' niggas is back, Jada and P
We got water, X, haze
Plus weight of the D
And I'm tired of hearing about old niggas that had it
And be the same old niggas that ratted (Who cares)
Talk 'bout how we hawk niggas in they fuckin' back

Gun work's official but niggas don't be wanting that
(Why?) 'Cause they puss and they mans is lame

We Soul for Real in the hood, we make Candy Rain

I could easily send you to God

But come and see me at the Plaza Hotel I might give you a job
If you can't remember the name
All you gotta do is ask the dame for the niggas that deliver the hard

We gon' make it, we gon' make it

We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it

Bet the hood won't miss you, you bitch ass nigga
Might find your man dead in the ocean

He be aight though

You know dead rappers get better promotion
Why we don't laugh at death, and cry at birth
Never say you can't do it 'til you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
But it's a message in everything, trust me, even a bullet
Go to war with the 8 and the pound
Think you got your ear to the street now, put your face in the ground
'Cause my shells is expensive
You'll know exactly why when you yellin' in intensive
My fellas is offensive
Lucky 'cause I got guns that crack your back
But that's not what I prefer, I manufacture crack
And niggas turn bitch when you show 'em the steel
But we know how to bid so y'all go 'head and squeal
I'm comfortable far from home
Eating right, getting good rest either on the bar or the phone
I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years
""Sound anything like Kiss? Then sign right here!""

While you poppin that X, I'ma pop yo chest

With the mac, servin niggaz ""Eightballs"" and up
You want to know why niggaz is broke, because they hate money
The rims that I'm sittin on is in they late twenties
Bitches want to see me holla at 'em, throw a dollar at 'em and
If they hustle throw some hard or some powder at 'em
This is for my South niggaz
Gold and platinum ice in they mouth niggaz
Let's ride out niggaz
Everybody gon' follow the bitches
Until they realize, bullets gon' follow the stitches
On the other hand, shit is real low, it's a fact that
Nine out of ten niggaz mouths get 'em killed though
What you ride for? What you die for?
'Cause I got some niggaz and some bitches that's my word that I kill for

Still in the hood doin' it
I don't know why I'm doin' this, we don't eve move a lot of units
But ain't no threats, don't stress me dog
You gotta let me hear somethin' to impress me dog
When I spit I put rappers in line, then smack 'em around 
I got 'em all home practicin' now

Bitches'll follow, gangsters'll ride, gentlemen watch
Buy the bar, leave drunk, shoot up the block
You might hear 'Kiss spittin', but after the show
You might hear clips spittin', we after your glow
Things'll never be the same again
When your frame get bent, link get worn, change get spent
Confiscate your whip - you think you a player?
I could confiscate your bitch, take her and slay her
If a nigga nicer than me, then Christ is here
You got somethin' in the bank? Then the dice is here
I could show you how to gamble your money, handle a gun
But be a family man and go home to your son
Light a candle where you stand, cause that's where you died
And if you heard 'Kiss spittin, then you know it was won, uh

Hey yo the voice got a lot of people heated, peep it
The flow is like methadone - lot of people need it
Seen it all happen before
Feel like I'm still hustlin'; cause the way I'm rappin is raw
You could put your jewels on it
You might just see me in the lightning pickup with the 22's on it
The stakes'll cost you; understand one thing
I do great field work plus I'ma boss too
Loyalty is hard to come by
Why'all know who the streets is run by, could only be one guy
And that be who but 'Kiss, no security
The burner and some niggaz that I grew up with
And the brand new 911, fuck a dime

They act like it's all love, only love is your money,
So when it's over nigga, are you a thug or a dummy,
I'm neither, but I been hot so long, it feels like I got a lifetime fever,
And I ain't gotta spit, I could cough and still eat ya,
And fuck rap I make mills of reefer,
I'm a man first, tired of punching niggas, so I'ma shoot niggas cause my hands hurt,

Tell em Kiss (The kiss of death!)

[Jadakiss]
This is LOXville, and even white America'll let y'all negros know Jada got skill
You a jackass like Johnny Knoxville,
So I can jus imagine how ya pops feel (damn!)
And you ain't worth my shells, so you should just imagine how the Ak feel,
A lot of niggas is thousandnaires, walking round town, fronting like they got mills
For what it's worth, I'm one myself, but my strength in the hood outruns my wealth
But you still might catch Kiss in some hot wheels, New Bentley coupe, with the stock wheels,
Haha, look how I get back to it, I send my young niggas to do it, in the black Buick,
I don't spit bars, I distribute the crack fluid,
All I'm really waitin on is for niggas to act stupid

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
To all my real niggas, sorry for keeping you waiting,
It's ironic, but the god was beefing with Satan,
I love y'all tho, my niggas for even relating,
This ain't Kiss talking neither, I'm speaking for Jason,
When you a problem it's harder to keep them from hating,
Niggas jaws, is like laws, don't easy to break em,
If I wasn't on some shit, I'm getting on it, come to me with ya hand out to me, I'm spitting on it,
I don't want to hear what happened, matter of fact, I don't even care what happened,
Might as well declare the clapping, 'cause my bones is old,
Gotta lot of wear and tear from scrapping,
Hate a nigga that, ain't never there to see shit, but always hear what happened,
The thing better than money, is respect,
No love this time, nigga, Kiss Of Death, what!

Work wit me
I want to thank y'all for coming out
Tonight
This is sum reel' shit

[Jadakiss]
First things first
When a nigga money ain't right
That makes things worst
Now he's just breathing he can barely manage
And he's way past starvin
He's really famished
His right-hand man is up north, that's hurting 'em
His cellphone bout to cut off, spring jerkin em
And his baby moms starting to do her thing again
She left him for a nigga pumping e up in Bengaltin
If his money is right than maybe he can diss her
But he can't, and niggas is breaking his little sister
His pops just past
His mom use to be an occasional sniffer
Then she started fuckin with the gas
Dude use to be a star back then
He had the benz CL something
But he just turned his car back in
Mad carrots pawned all his rings
Took this thing next thing I know
Money pawned all his bling
Now he just like everybody
With the same old plans
That can't get over the hump
With the same old grams
They was on the block making fun of him
He slid off came back with his hammer and killed everyone of em

[Chorus]
Cause when I come through clear it out,
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When I come through clear it out,
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When I come through clear it out,
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When i come through clear it out
Play the sideline and observe

Me and B.I go man to man
I know niggas with an asshole
Full of parole that go hand in hand
Fuck hot that's humidity
And you can't mix money with stupidity
Even though I get my coke from Columbia
My cars from Germany
And my guns from Sicily
Nothing personal but I was raised different
Hold my joint sideways so I blaze different
Give it to anybody fuck an age difference
From those in the world to those in the casket
Rub the kite on your chest and swallow the stamp
At the end of the day they still gonna follow the champ
It ain't about being lyrical
Cause when I get in the booth
I make miracles and I ain't stared at you
But I'm in tune with the hood so I'm better than you
And when you see me comin you know what is better to do

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
can't lie all I got is my balls and my vocals
And the only security I roll wit is my social
It don't look decent
It's like niggas left they crew in the hood
And went on the rode with the president
Had it up to here with this fake shit
They don't even want a nigga to earn his
Just give and take shit
Just make sure you mention my name in the top brackets
And make sure you mention your name as the top fagot
Trust me this go around I will not have it
I putting niggas heads to bed like crapmadics
How you think your man died
More money than respect
And it wasn't close it was by a landslide
Listen my nigga your work is sloppy
And I don't love them hoes but the purple got me
If I don't don't do it with music I'ma do it wit poppy
Just play the sideline and observe and watch me
Let's go

[Chorus]",Air It Out
Jadakiss,"Top of the food chain, its just the way that I do things
The dungaree seats in the blue range, I'm working with new change
A Gemini nigga with mood swings, had the fiends lookin' for new things
I stop playing with birds, and started playin with words
The money wasn't right so I had to stay on the curb
And I'll be a player later but for now call me ? Kiss
If not that, mon take it Jada, I kick hard balls and blow hard weed
And be everywhere 'cause I move at God's speed
And my aim is make y'all bleed, y'all got embarrassed in da class
When the teacher used to make y'all read, uh huh, mind over matter
And that's all good, but fuck that my new shit is spine over bladder
And everybody tryna get to the top and that's all good too but right now I'm on da ladder

Look at you then and look at you now
don't let this cold cold world bring you down

Look at you then and look at you now
don't let this cold cold world bring you down

I know your queen got her eyes on me,
I got my eyes on your queen, the SMG is Heineken green,
bad thing is you know before long, that we gon' get it on,
my kit cost thirty and ten to put it on,
No tints, windows clean, heavy windex, gears on the steering wheel
I shift her with my index real life is just in another form
Kiss of death, its about to be another storm I'm a goddamn raging bull
Stay outta jail by just telling myself the cage is full
Got niggas on the payroll just to squeeze, you in no position to challenge my expertise
They get a bonus if they leave you old school
From the era of the 45 with a penny on the needle
Ball to the bosses so please don't violate or cross him
Or you'll be the corpse and the corpses

Look at you then and look at you now
don't let this cold cold world bring you down

Look at you then and look at you now
don't let this cold cold world bring you down

Uh uh huh you know the wold anger is just one letter short of the word danger
And I ain't no stranger, never use a gat more than twice if you don't clean it
And never say fuck something if you don't mean it, and when it comes to life
The root you been using thus far ain't working far right, take the scenic
Whatever faith you got, put it in a crook, want to hide something from a nigga
Put it in the book, trust me this album the vapor gonna go around if you ain't hot
You need paper to throw around ya its getting clearer everyday
When you wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and say

Look at you then and look at you now
don't let this cold cold world bring you down

Look at you then and look at you now
don't let this cold cold world bring you down",Bring You Down

If I do it on the spot or if it takes me long they can't stop me
Even if my breaks was on
I'm still

I'm always here, nobody's perfect 
Life ain't always fair

Until you get to the car
And you gotta get through the D before you get to the are
If I don't get you today then I'ma get you tomorrow
As soon as you come out your crib I'ma be right
(By your side)
Where I'm supposed to be
Close to you, with the toast close to me
And screw it if it's the right or wrong thing
When you in the sight of that long thing
You wish you had a strong team right

As long as you need me 
I'm down for whatever hommie as long as you feed me
I pull the big joints out as long as the TV
Or I can play my part and just breathe easy right

As soon as something happen to you 
Your niggas would bounce and you thought they were scrappin' witcha you
Now you cleanin' your cuts with peroxide
And you wake up in the ER with the Doc right
(By your side)
Puttin' tubes in you and you can't even eat right
They puttin' food in you
Your body's getting colder
Devil on your shoulder
And you Mom's in the room but you just want to hold herâ?¦

Until they finish me off
If they don't get us both you'll be sending me off
And please just do me this favor
Stick to our little plan
And fuck the money
Just keep my little manâ?¦
(By your side)
And show 'em there's hope
And he gon' think he knows what's going
But show him the ropes
And if you bring him to the Gucci store
Show him the loffs hood niggas I'm just showing you growth
But I'm still right
(By your side)
You know Kiss don't gotta aim his gun at you to be focused
And if you broke now nigga when you see those chips
Watch how many people come out of nowhere
And try to beâ?¦
(By your side)
The answer's plenty 
Cause when you handling business you can't be friendly
And if you tryna stack something
Can't be pennies
Most likely grants and benggies
And you better keep em

Not on no sucka shit trying to make it right for them

Then you try to show 'em shit the average nigga
Don't appreciate nothing so all that shit is over with

Did a track with everybody except Mr. Shakur

Just makes more prints the older I get

To not the jada with the ?, its the Jada with the fo' fifth, clutchin on the fifth
With Snoop be in the front and his jewelry shining all through his clothes and little tigger's
In the back on the low, but I still shine though

[Chorus]

[Female Singer]
Keep doing what you doing
It's ya time and its ya shine
I love the way you ride
I hope you shine
The party starts tonight
My friends are coming over
I really think you fly
Tonight's the night

[Jadakiss]
Uh ya, uh like a African diamond that's deeper than rapping and rhyming
Success happens with timing, over here I'm doin low with the punk
When I'm over there I'm in the low low with my unc and all the bitches
Looking for us but I ain't looking for puss, right now ma I'm looking for cush
And I'm strapped with the pound and ? shoes, cackies, T shirts
Uh uh after my surrounding, air force ones, jeans, city lab
A fitted that's when I'm back in the town and don't get it confused
I'm proud to be gone, be home in a year with duffel bags out on the lawn
So much money my niggas be counting it wrong, so many hits
I can't keep count of the songs and we still grindin, stainless still nine
And ya'll still hate but we still shining let's go

[Chorus]
Shine, shine, shine
Everyday when I'm rollin through the hood
Playas watch me 'cause they know I
Shine, shine, shine
Hey I know I'm shinin I'm fresh ?? bodies in the ??
Love to hate me 'cause you know I'm gonna
Shine, shine, shine

(Feds in the precinct looking at our picture)
If rap don't work we gonna get it like Guy Fisher
(I was taught to ride with them niggas that'll die with ya)
Headed OT? Then bring some pies with ya
(Buy your man a lambo and tell him to fly with ya)
Or throw the nigga jewels and tell him to shine with ya
(I shine)
You shine
(Like smith and wesson you don't wanna feel the ghost)
Or the kiss of death and
(Tubs still lift up)
So do the sink now
(Pablo escobar shit)
Buying a clink now
(Dead presidents shit)
Robbin the Brinks now
(100 shot Tommy guns)
Hell of a stink now

('Cause the P will hollow the gun to holla at son)
Muah, I'm that nigga y'all know that
(Do it Holiday Style)
Double are is Coming for War

On the average day we smoke about a quarter
(And everything's is bad for a nigga nowadays)
So we drink a lot of water
(talk about you ""so rich"")
Nigga you ""so bitch""
(that your parents probably think they got a daughter)
Yeah we them boys that bring all the terror
(we persevered through all the errors)
Lay niggas down with all barettas
(everything in the bag--chains, watches)
all your leathers
(So you can act funny with yourselves)
I'm in the hood with dope
(Sacks is filled twenty after twelve)
A sign of the times kitchen cook 38, 38 treys
(that remind you of dimes)

[Chorus]

Hustlers, entrepreneurs
(Anything to do with the hood)
That's what we responsible for
(Batting you down)
Knifing you up
(Stomping your jaw)
Bail a nigga out for stealing something out on the tour
(And they makin technology to trya nd screw niggas)
I'm good long as an old gun will kill a new nigga
(Y'all dudes with 9 lives got one life left)
And controversy sells but it ain't like death
(So pop him in the head til his brains start to fizz on him)
I ain't sell my soul to the devil, I bought his from him
(Waiting on the day they say Jesus is gonna come)
So god bless y'all niggas 'cause I'm sneezing with my gun

(Bless you)
You ain't D Block or Double are nigga
(No doubt i'ma stretch you)
I'ma shoot back 10 feet
(I'ma catch you)
Real brutal shit
(Make sure I snap your neck too)
SLR or the Aston Mar'

Iced out
(Or wear no ice at all)
100 Gs on the dice game
(Life's a ball)
Listen up, if you real get real estate
(We the best in the game, that ain't a real debate)
And they never had AK's peeling face

Uh-huh, real life shit
Na'mean True story
Feel me, matter of fact Still feel me
Uh yea, yo
Past few years shit got so ill
Kinda hard for the god to laugh through tears
I went through something with momma, no drama
Something that came and went, real life karma
My pop think his son is deserting em, its hurtin em
Guess I gotta be the man, sit down & work with em
My little boy 7, he the sequel to the thug
So I told him the money will never equal the love
Listen I'm grown why'all, when it comes to my family it's never a problem
It's only a phone call, the tend to take that and run with it
So every other month I be on some new number shit
They violated Stay again, Gus totaled the beamer & broke Kay leg again
Shhh, let us pray again and I ain't get enough of hanging in local bars yet
Had to let the thang off, cross town in the projects
All these rumors, shit I ain't get robbed yet
Bitch ass niggaz ain't stop actin like broads yet
And arm reach off a gun & a mask, somebody clipped me for a hundred in cash
Still feel me, I hit the road try to get more grip
It was cool til' a mutha fuckin tour bus flipped
Uh, no charges brought up, bitch popped up with a kid
Got caught up, then I put a court up
Now The road the the riches is taking me longer
It ain't kill yet so it makin me stronger
I don't know if its the hate, frustration, or hunger
The keep a nigga going, rappin for a reason
Shit don't just don't happen, shit happen for a reason
I'm that dude, like it or love it
I do my thang in the hood, get right with a budget
Ain't afraid to give my life to the public
And when you see me next time maybe we can further discuss
How my 16's give you a visual
I know you thinking he ain't really selling, how he life off residuals
But right now the game is pitiful
Niggaz is lonely, they need company 'cause they miserable

Yeah, uh-huh shit it still real be	
That's why I want you to still feel me
Still feel me, one I'm out",Still Feel Me
Jadakiss,"Yeah, yo, I'm the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
Mother of pearl delivery, voice of God
And, it's hard just being the boss
Being I can't go to jail cause them years'll cost me
Don't get me wrong, lay a nigga down if he force me
Rather just sit back and roll a dutch
Think how I'ma put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how I'ma get the 'caine over Customs
Never underestimate niggas, or over trust them
yeah them M's is right in my face
I just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it don't jam, the Tech will spray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
Cause I'm a nigga that hate to settle
I'm a man of the Lord but I still can't escape the devil
Moved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what

The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, that time is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, start acting up, and I'll leave you underground

I know how to get my pairs off me
They can cry and die from high blood pressure cause tears are salty
It's a symptom if you bobbin your head
Know that he's sick, know the flow is ridic', now throw him a grip
When I get it, you already know I'm throwing them bricks
Putting purple everywhere, daddy, I'm throwing them nicks
That's right, homey, you can't move me
I ain't going nowhere, I'm in the hood like bootleg movies
All you shooting is the breeze, a bootleg uzi
I'm just waiting on a que like Suzie, don't lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
Into something else that'll make something melt
You just gotta feel the kid
if not rap for the fact of how real he is, whatever

The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, that time is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, start acting up, and I'll leave you underground

Hey yo, niggas know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap, now he put out two anthems a year
And I just want to rock for a century
Then chase the book with the documentary
If you, can't do nothing other than flow
Life's a bitch like the mother from ""Blow"", let's go
Don't make me put your heart in your lap
Fuck riding the beat, nigga, I parallel park on the track
Hop out looking crispy, fresh and new
In the six, but it's a BM, and it's Pepsi blue
And, I don't know you.
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Y'all ain't fucking with Jason
After I cash in, there's really no justification
Of how I'm gonna change the game, so don't get outta line
Cause this little nine will change your frame, what up

The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, that time is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, start acting up, and I'll leave you underground",Time's Up

I love it when you say
K-I-S-S me
And I just want to make
Love love love

Ayo the crib got your friends workin'
We travel to France for French curtains
You was there when I was on the bench hurtin'
Now that I own my team
It's only right that I condone my queen
Try to show her my dream
And I can't let her get lost now
She carries the money, the hammers and material across town
And understands she's fine
And understands she's mine
She understands the grind
Cook cleans and irons
And whatever she want to push
I'm cosign
And if I ain't got it already
Then I'm'a go find it
I guess I'm'a lucky don
And she a lucky queen
'Cause her jewelry box looks like lucky charms
All color stones
And she know I'm in the hood
But she also knows that I'm comin' home
Mr. Raspy thought I was in love with money
'Till the first time we did the nasty

[Chorus]

Yo whatever the road to paradise is
We on it
Gave me your income tax check so I can get on with
Those were the days
These are the times
You held me down with nearly damn near everything
Even my rhymes
I would play a song for you
You let me know exactly how the ladies would respond
From a woman's point of view
And that's why my girlie is hear with me
I love it when she layin' in the bed with la perla or vickies
The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes and tell she's real
Just imagine the way she smell and the way she feel
And the sex was crazy then and its crazy still
And you know I'm from the streets so it's crazy ill
And we waitin' on a new island
We been to all of them four five or times
Come on mami, you wylin'

[Chorus]

When things was rough
Only person I could call was you
Now everything I do
I do it all for you

Come touch me
Come kiss me
Come love me

Anyway you want to boy
And I'm good as long as I'm close to you
Doin' things that grown folks is supposed to do
Come on

Come hold me 
Come feel me
Come take me
Anyway you want to boy

Yo
Money is great but what we got is more better
We got the four letters
When it comes from the heart it's more pleasure
And for the fact that you trust me still
Thus far I appreciate what we've built
All the minks that I bought you that drag the floor
And all the nights that you sat up and bagged the raw
Damn I'm thinkin' you gotta hate it
But yet and still you tolerate it
(We gone make it, We gone make it)
That's why ma we gotta make it

More lies than truth definitely more rumors than reality
Only way you beating a body is a technicality
Other than that catch em and Clinton on a gallery
The determination and dedication of discipline
Listening and catching the jewels you was missing
And they still doing coward shit
You know the haters gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it
Something in the air but the older they get,
They kill you quicker over a girl than over a brick,
We don't play with the lizards, we make phrases up and say 'em exquisite,
Anytime you can pay us a visit

You'll be shot fore you even realize you were spied over three blocks

Why is the industry designed to keep the artist in debt?
And why them dudes ain't riding if they part of your set?
And why they never get it popping but they party to death?
Yea, and why they gonna give you life for a murder?
Turn around only give you eight months for a burner? It's going down
Why they selling niggas CD's for under a dime?
And if it's all love, daddy, why you come with your 9?
Why my niggas ain't get that cake?
Why is a brother up north better than Jordan
That ain't get that break?
Why you don't stack instead of trying to be fly?
Why is ratting at an all time high?
Why are you even alive?
Why they kill 2pac n' Chris?
Why, at the bar, you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin Cris?
Why them bullets have to hit that door?
Why did Kobe have to hit that raw?
Why'd he kiss that whore?

Is this pain that I’ve been living
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that?

Why do niggas push pounds and powder?
Why did Bush knock down the towers?
Why you around them cowards?
Why Aaliyah have to take that flight?
Why my nigga D ain't pull out his Ferrari
Why he take that bike?
Why they gotta open your package and read your mail?
Why they stop letting niggas get degrees in jail?
Why you gotta do 85% of your time?
And why do niggas lie in 85% of they rhymes?
Why a nigga always want what he can't have?
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag?
Why did crack have to hit so hard?
Even though it's almost over
Why niggas can't get no jobs?
Why they come up with the witness protection?
Why they let the Terminator win the election?
Come on, pay attention!
Why I sell in the stores what you could sell in the streets?
Why I say the hottest shit but we sellin' the least?

All that I’ve been given
Is this pain that I’ve been living
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that?
Tried to make it my way
But got sent up on the highway
Why? oh why

Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar?
Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it?
Why they didn't make the CL6 with a clutch?
And if you don't smoke why the hell you reaching for my dutch?!
Why rap? Cause I need air time
Why be on the curb with a ""Why lie? I need a beer"" sign?
Why all the young niggas is dying?
Cause they moms at work, they pops is gone, they living with iron
Why they ain't give us a cure for AIDS?
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days?
Why you screaming like it's a slug? It's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York?
Why they forcing you to be hard?
Why ain't you a thug by choice?
Why the whole world love my voice?

Anyway I'm K-I-double
All I do is get dough, spit flows, try to stay out of trouble
If you ready we could move, just lose your man
or hit the dance floor, I'll show you how to do my dance
Or I might let you play in the garden
Or sit up in that white thing and listen to the greatest of Marvin
The estate got six locations
Take so long to get to the front once I missed probation
And I hate to brag
I know ya man really wouldn't like the Baretta but he'd hate the Mag
And yeah here go a blank check, rock yourself out

Wanna let ya hair down? (knock yourself out)

Wanna run in my mansion? (knock yourself out)
Sit in V.I.P.? (knock yourself out)

Now you can knock yourself out like you boxin yourself
Or you can get real freaky start poppin yourself
And my watch got so many rocks, when you look at the time
it's sorta like you watchin yourself, uh
Front if you want, I puff a few blunts
and take a cruise in a Porsche wit the trunk in the front
She had the Jocko Bijou sandals, told her hop in
The coupe blew her mind when she couldn't find the door handles

I'm runnin out of my patience
Don't sleep wit me? Then don't speak wit me
And never talk bad bout niggas that eat wit me

Aiyyo, honey know I'm waitin to leave
Keep dancin, cause I like how that ass shake in them capris
I'm like Big wit the murder mamis up in Belize
but I'll still fuck a chicken head like Lil' Cease
I don't care if they model, bet they all gon' chill

25 years no felony I'm tellin why'all
why you think I saved it, to blow a nigga melon off
as a young boy always carried a cap gun
fell in love wit it first time I clapped one
now I'm a grown man more mature and pleasant
and like hittin niggas in the jaw with the desert
and everybody got a gun, why not me
you gotta keep it on you now it's just like I.D.

And I ain't never felt this way 'bout no lady
Considering going half with you on yo' baby
Something about you, making me go crazy
Know if I ain't soured up, I'm so hazy
Me and you on the same page, so amazing
Need your love girl, so many ways
And you could only hold in out for so many days
And, got enough points to score but you shaving
Hell yeah I'm anxious, but you craving
Time keep flying, I'ma keep trying
Bottom line, I need your L-O-V-I-N
Come on!

He such a small fella, to recognize the Mason Martin Margiela
What could I tell her
Man I swear you got to see her to believe her
Then maybe you could understand why I need her
Besides her being a diva she wasn't bothered by the chiba
Zodiac sign was a libra
Definitely a keeper, I just wanna put her in a sleeper then fall out underneath her
Wake up, take a shower, then get deeper
Juice up get some power and then freak her
After the feedback then I could G Mack
But it's something about her love making me need that, come on!

When the drama comes my way (Way)
Long as I GOT YOU, girl it's nothing

Baby girl, your love is something I need

Yo, they say every good woman needs a thug
I totally agree, that's why I need your love (yep)
And I can't help it, if I'm selfish
Cause I need your love and nobody else's
Starting to taste it, pardon the bracelet (padon)
Chance of a lifetime and I can't waste it
If being beautiful was a test, should've aced it
Her skin is flawless, her hair is wavelengths
Hi I'm Jason, ma I'm patient-ly waitin for us to have relations
Kissing me is just history in the makin
Squeezing and hugging I need your loving, come on!

Stays hot, I ain't got to get my buzz back

Been living the life, praising ice.
Bang the baddest chicks in the world, maybe twice
The swag, the gear, the bread, all the whips is a year ahead
I only fear the feds
Fourty-five on the other side of the peep hole
Head shot from point blank, call it a free throw
Funny, 'cause I had divisions since Calico
Back then, I still aint reached my peak, though
Louie loafers, Pollo pea coat
Call me whenever the forces meat, yo
I drove papi crazy, so the industries never gonna stop me, baby

I'nma call it confidence, 'cause I ain't cocky
I just know one thing, They can't stop me
Whether I'm on ""Ef"" or LA, or they swap me,
It's all good, because I know the gangsters got me
First thing's first they jar us abruptly
I treat the rap game like a large monopoly
One on one they can't guard me properly
But when they double team me the odds are sloppy
I move like them eighty milligrams of oxy
Send your sister back to your family, not me
Got too hot for the grams, and got weed

Whoever feel like they ain't gotta leave, I'm rippin' them
Even though the love's frail the thug's real

Much harder fightin' when the battle is uphill
Whatever the knife can't handle the slug will
Keep a good lawyer that's smart work on cases
Still gotta run from the NARCs, they gon' chase us (run)

Dust smokin' niggas walk around in the matrix
Loyalty is thin, tension is thick
Look at a broke nigga's face when you mention a brick
Stick up kids come around, when they sense that you rich
Cans of lizzle get lit, when you get hit with a fifth
Niggas they used to hoop dreamin' is now sellin' the piff
And they still rattin' but you can't tell if you stiff
Especially when the tek spit, fuck around get your head and your neck hit
Lookin' for a death wish, walk

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Talkin' out your mouth
All wreckless to a nigga that you know
That'll let it off
That's a death wish
When your heart stops and your body gets breathless
And help don't come in enough time
That's a death wish
When you see the blood, realize that your chest is hit
And don't know where it came from
That's a death wish
When you know a nigga whole style's on select shit
(young money)when you violate 'em, fwah
That's a death wish

[Lil Wayne]
On that way left shit
Better get right or get left shit
Better hit right or get left, hit
Even if you threw the best pitch
Yes bitch
It's Weezy F. Bitch
I'm the best, bitch
Motherfuck your guest list
I'll be like let's just kill 'em
And get breakfast
Neck slit, next shit expect this
Every time you check this
I'm exit I mean excited to be your death wish
Bitch I wear this G-shit on my heart not my necklace
And I keep the hypno' for the hecklers
And I'm from the mecca of the wreckless
With a record-breaking debt list
The wreckers and neglectors think all that shit won't affect us
I'm high above you above law above average
Niggas snitching putting niggas in the can like a beverage
Damn
I pop out your head fuck up your memories
I'll put a bullet in Nina head and let her reminisce
Yea
You still don't remember shit
You gon' remember this
I'm knockin' niggas down this year
I'm on my timber shit
Big lion growl at you niggas on that simba shit
I be on that fuck yo clique I kill every member shit
Cool as December shit
Bang in any weather shit
And they can buy your bag but the parts sold separate
Yea that's a bad bitch
Like Russian roulette bitch
Weezy be the genie in the bottle here's your death wish

Now we grinding hard just like we wanna do
Grinding day and night so we can kick off our shoes
And live a glamorous life look what we made it to
We some real life bosses got 'em looking at you
We grind hard to play harder
We touch the stars that's what they call us
We grind hard to buy the mall up
We grind hard to play harder (harder)

[Jadakiss]
24/7 365
If we ain't breaking them down
Then we letting them fly
Nah never I, always we
I came in the game dividing the pies by three
Then we got famish
So we set standards
Very similar to the ten crack commandments
Some couldn't take it
Others got lost and couldn't make it
He wanted to floss but couldn't fake it
The hood embraced it
The rest is basics
No need to rush be extra patient
The new 4 door Porsche is extra spacious
Same entourage no extra faces
Hands down the best no explanations
And to the top is the next destination
There ain't no time outs
Death is the only time we goin' sign out
So we goin' grind out

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Top 5 dead or alive what they consider them
Soon as them things come in we get rid of em
Mo money mo problems gotta live with em
Only thing they care about is what you giving them
Not the energy that you wasted in the game
Or the tears that tripled down your face from the pain
The time the jaw cracked you wasted the cane
Had to do two shifts to make it the same
That all changed soon as you tasted the fame
And it was all worth it after you made you a name
Thanks to our heavily father
We fly on the jet now instead of the charter
Leave a nice tip in the front for the gardener
Do all of listening so we stay smarter
Everybody's a hero when they get scarred up
Its my ball check it up y'all better guard up

[Chorus]

When we step up out of our car the whole damn world is looking at us
Cause they knew us from before, now we ain't hurting no more
You can bring me the bill I will sign my name
Now we're flying private planes and such looking like a million bucks
You can't tell me nothing!

Everyday there's something in my way. I try
Shit ain't going right I try to see the light. I try
Oh, it's like my eyes got a cover on em and something holding me back
A better man better level better know I try

[Jadakiss]
Yeah yo, Listen I done played with the snakes in the grass
Paid for my mistakes I made in the past
Everybody ate when I came wit the cash
At least I tried to ride the wave till it crashed
Same wood on the gun handle is on the dash
All the hoods that son ran through is on smash
They can't identify you wit a mask
And the bible I'll tell you nothing is gonna last
The name of the game's survival
If you make it alive when you ride through they make it arrival
My boo is gon' ride you know I am gon' ride too
Make an M every day I am gon' try to
Let's go

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Yeah yo, I tried to tell niggas I am willing to blast for it
I only try to give it to niggas that ask for it
Got them things on the scale I am still weighing em
Thought my dues was paid I am still paying em
Couple Elanor's and the Goose I am still baying em
Semi's and the fulli's know that the truth stay wit em
Wolves and gorillas is loose so don't play with em
Something's holding em back there's nothing that you can say to em
Popped champagne wit biggie at the palladium
Put that good hawk work in with the titanium's
Shit switch around when them heats get fired
And ya peeps just died but I least he tried Let's go

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Yeah, 
Watch the game get taken over
I am still on the same side of the fence I am just looking over
A solider from the gravel to the grass
To the obstacles in life I travel in the past
Whether I am holding a mic or holding a mac
It's like an invisible force is holding me back
But I ain't letting go of my pride
After I get the dough I slide
Better know I tried, let's go

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Avery Storm]
Here come another day up on me
Put the pressure on me here we go again ah
I try to do what's right when life is so wrong
I want a better way, I see a better day

God knows that I try but time won't wait for me

Jadakiss,"Ciphers in front of The Apollo as a shorty
Now I got a clip full of hollows in the.40
Louis, Guccis, every now and then Mauris
I take too long to come back, send for me
Know how to work it, big things pop on the underground circuit
Maintain 'til it surface
The nerve of these peasants
Treat a rap budget like a bird how I stretch it
Think they get the message
Waters, Dutchies, lot of herb in a session
So-called tough guys, herbs with aggression
Put your thoughts all over the curb with the Wesson
What used to be superb now is depressing
Negative energy
Generated from the snakes and the centipedes
You will remember me
I just get the storm started
Cold-blooded, warm-hearted
Either way you on target
Move to the side, let the lane merge
The gun's like fried rice, who want they brain stirred?
Enter the limelight, lemon drop-top off of crime life
Always see the crew in the hindsight
Yeah!
American sedan, the shooters got Berettas in their hand
This is Mafia, veterans'll plan
Word to the tape on the brick, this is raw
I'm in the 4x4, 8 plus 8 in the clip
The hustling Harry Potter, shaking the brick
Ice in the bracelet give the Matrix a glitch
And my car's like a spaceship
Got gold in my Nike checks
Jordans got ice in the laces
Pants got a gun where the waist is
It's basic, shirt smell like herb smoke
Chirp, yo, Chirp back
Let me know who getting murked, though
Yeah, we getting money, nigga
Who getting work, though
And I got the Kush, nigga
I got the Purple, move squares
'Cause we got a hold on the circle
Kill you or hurt you, whatever's a virtue
Beat you like ya parents when you breaking your curfew

[Chorus]
Homie, live life to the death
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
Get this money, it don't matter if it's cash or check
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
Big houses, cars and jewels that's wet
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
To the family, friends, whole life is set
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step, one more step

Yo, living my life, what's left of it
Don't try to go to jail but if you do make the best of it
If you crash into a bullet then it ain't no estimate
It's a money-back guarantee, my nigga
Death's a definite
This is audio crack, guess who's cheffing it
Jadakiss and SP, do this effortless
Gun play make you do whatever son say
If the Lord send you a flight, the ticket is one-way
Put that work in when you young, you get power
The money don't match the running it get sour
Still rep the hood to the death
A promise is only good if it's kept
Niggas'll kill you for less
Silence is golden, go 'head, keep dozing
The window of opportunity keeps closing
We gon' see if you really a clutch baller
A cell is small, but a casket is much smaller
Burn out 30 a set shit, 60 a Key shit
That's street shit, Jada & P shit
Lambos, hoopties, shooters and groupies
Montclair, D-Squared, Emilio Pucci
Long trips, short trips, making me nauseous
Court shit, gave them Jews money for Porsches
Made a couple mil for the small shit
We rap and keep raw, so we on some street lore-Forbes shit
Wall still spin, upgraded the floor flip
Ain't touch it, ain't see it, ain't hear about it
If it's money gone, believe we gon' care about
Send some niggas to your crib, take the air up out it
Leave some blood up in it
Listen, fam, the Lam's the color of toast
The seats is like butter in it
No hammers in the club, box cutter in it
Long money and big checks
Get popped in the chest, face, wig, neck

And it's the evils that's gonna make you have to compare it
You know me, I swing back through and see who got hit after I air it
But it ain't about shit, niggas mumble about my outfits
But I'm humble, I keep my mouth shut
Lacin' them well, it was destined for J's in the cell
I can make you a reservation to hell
Then blow you out the water, I'm out of your order

Something like a poet and an author
The only difference is that I mix slick talk with pain and torture

Don't let the game extort ya
Try to learn from what the game has taught ya

They rappin' with hostility, meanin' they whack
But then again, I feel 'em
Knowin' that they up against a nigga just like myself that'll kill 'em
Gotta spend a buck at the dealer for suede ceilings
Lotta bodies drop because of betrayed feelins'
What other rappers you know made it and stay dealin'
Smart niggas just fell back and they saved millions
These are pedestrian bars for the civilians
Shoes is Italian, handgun Brazilian
Open it up and see what Kiss brought ya
Slick talk, pain, and torture

Sorta like birds and pounds
Rub shoulders in the industry with nerds and clowns
Give it to whoever deserve the rounds
Hollow tips, move organs and nerves around
Get money, fuck riffin'
I'm definitely cut different, I twist honey's, puff piffin
Get my insight from an old G, with a good job and all that buddy love sniffin'

Yo Shawty is courageous,
Going through the stages,
Of where her body is more mature,
Than her age is,
Far from the daddy's little girl type,
Can't even imagine what her world's like,
It all started off as a youngin',
Stepfather used to touch her,
And she couldn't say nothing,
The more she held in the pain,
It kept coming,
Eventually it scarred her for life as a woman,
And then he just kept touching her,
Inside that was crushing her,
I got something to discuss with her,
I'm coming with the tech,
With the ear holes and the mufflers.

Now she gotta raise her child poor,

Push the pen like a pack and let it work through the trap (Snyp!)
Get your roof cut, ace hit by shooter's that'll spray shit
And if it ain't the ruger shit'll melt you and your face split

[ Bully]
Okay, Bully bitch!
Uh, I'm something else, run through niggas like Phelps
D-Block's next generation explains itself (D-Block!)
You don't wanna FUCK with Bully the don-dada
Name ring bells in the hood, a known shotter
You gets nada when it comes to my ricotta
Fresh Levi's, black V-necks and Pradas
I'm a problem for niggas if nothing else
Control, substitute or police, I'm something else

My entourage is large, so hard
Kiss run the streets, my niggas run the yard
Whoever disagree can bet they get scarred

We keep it so rugged, but we still so suave
Just seen your girl, 'bout to give me a massage

Jadakiss,"I just want to Thank y'all for taking the time to listen
I appreciate that

Yo regular TV to cable from bouncing label to label
Just trying to get the horse out the stable
Was once part of a dynasty, well least I was trying to be
Think it was the time when I was finding me
Sitting in the spot with the dimes willing to do anything to be a bad boy at the time
Then I rolled the dices nah the money didn't add up 
But just that whole experience it was priceless
No free rides to the bank on top of that was the untimely demise of Frank (BI)
Then the No Way Out Tour we was smoking outdoor spent 80 stacks on C LO that without tour
Videotape it all I still watch it, now travel the world learn how to rock a crowd
It ain't much but it beats poor Things that I been through is all I can speak for

[Chorus: Luther]
I can only speak for the things that I been through
I can only speak for the things that I been through

Now I'm on Ruff Ryder Interscope same shit Partnership Joint Venture 50/50 same split
Jimmy put the money up two singles off of we are the streets 
Then after that seem like he was done with us but it wasn't over yet
Styles had a plan from the jump which was to come out with my solo next
Things a little better these the niggas that I been doing it with forever so I'm like whatever
First album dropped promotion was hella Every stage I rocked performance was stella
Had the whole world ready to ride or die for me and I wasn't platinum I was just side money
X was bringing the mulla I was in the hood in the kitchen with the digital ruler
I can't tell bout the evil me do, I can only speak for the things that I been through

[Chorus: Luther]
I can only speak for the things that I been through
I can only speak for the things that I been through

As far as the LOX we all fine cellar is all wine
Selfish for me to say Roc Fella is all mine cause it ain't
I'm just a another employee that's on line trying to get my act together and do it one more time
Twenty-one gunz salute with all nines and I know it's on me to make sure we all shine (Gotta)
Fall Back let the weed contact your mind, 
Confined all bull shit in any contract you sign
If you from the streets though it's plenty of loop holes to eat
Yo once they let you in your suppose to keep doe
But I can't give you the formula I'm on it though
Expect the worst the outcome is enormous though stay humble 
Still keep your heat for insurance though
Things that I been through to get it weren't normal yo
Yeah This is what my heart beats for
Things that I been through is all that I can speak for

Take a second, what if we could rewind the hood?
Better yet, what if the L.O.X. would of signed with Suge?
What if Puffy never signed us?
What if Oprah made them comments
Like Imus?
What if you designed this
Thought like I did?
Said it like this:
What if Peyton was fighting dogs instead of Mike Vick?
What if Arnold would just let Tookie get life?
What if B.I.G. missed the party, what if 'Pac missed the fight?
What if you was caged in?
What would you change then?
What if there was no Rocafella law for +Made Men+?
What if hate ran through me?
And what if Portland
Would've drafted Jordan
Instead of Sam Bowie?
What if you really have to be nice to get a deal?
What if all of these rappers' ice was really real?
What if I hit you with the razor from cheek to chin?
What if Mike Jackson never would have bleached his skin?

[Chorus: x2]
What if you never knew things that you needed to know?
What if you never been places you needed to go?
What if you get there, and learned them as you go?
""What if"" is the question, can I ask then once more?

[Jadakiss]
What if the pain went away?
What if you changed in a day?
What if you can eliminate
All the games
People play?
What if Shyne beat the case?
What if Diddy did a dime flat?
What if Nelson Mandela could give his time back?
What if Malcolm was silent?
What if Martin was violent?
What if you could really ""sneak an uzi on the island""?
Yeah
What if I made you kiss the niner?
What if a brick was only just a misdemeanor?
What if Manhattan was hit by Hurricane Katrina?
What if a black man was the one controlling Fema?
What if we ain't never let emotions come between us?
What if the last time we rode, someone seen us?
What if

[Chorus: x2]

[Nas]
Yeah, yea, yo
I flow calm
But don't push
What if Saddam
Hung Bush?
What if ""One Mic"" was called ""One Hook""?
What if the Bridge never showed me how to hold a weapon?
What if I ran into that sick chick with no protection?
What if I never wore that army jacket?
Carhard to match it
Unlaced tims, the hood on my first album cover under plastic?
What if I was just another corny rapper?
What if I went first instead of Notorious, who would tell my story after?
What if we loved less and lust more?
If Obama was on Mount Rushmore?
Would Ali give Tyson a busted jaw?
What if I never glared out the project window?
Whenever the the scared for me and the life of my kinfolk?
What if that gun pin broke?
I would have never learned back in the body of an Enzo
All red
What if all real niggas was all dead
What if Hilary and them
Were reptilian?
And 2012 was the end of men
And all world civilians?

In case you run out of empties use sandwich bags
Play with the hand you was dealt
That's why I ride the track til it melts
I can care less how you feel how you felt
I done spent niggas rent money on belts
Threesomes in the trunk 
I'm fucking for the wealth
And the hood ask about me I'm something else

I ain't even did nothing
And it look like I'm trafficking

Speaking of my chain
Need to get a job
Get the fuck up out my neck

You know my hammer large, I'm the man in charge
I like your Louie bag, the Monty Grammer flange
A little zif and dale, a little ace of spade
I'ma roll the purple up, let you taste the haze
You know I gotta thug it, Olympic size swimming pool
With the mosaic towels at the bottom of it
You could spin and keep spinning, I ain't got a budget
I can put enough away and I ain't gotta touch it
Don't worry about nothing, Kiss got it covered
You now rocking with the best girl, gotta love it

Girl, oh girl
You're now rocking with the best of both worlds
Girl, oh girl
You're now rocking with the best of both, girl

When you're at the top, there's no stopping it
Take a second realize who you're rocking with
Just noticed the color car that you're shopping with
Take pride in the joint when you're mopping it
Kiss melts in your mouth like chocolate
Make sure it's hot whenever you're dropping it
Right now we got billionaire guap to get
You ain't in the boys club, you just copped the fifth
I'm two-stepping in, honey popping in
Your first was the worst now it's the opposite
Yes, I must confess girl
You're now rocking with the best, girl

Closer for the (kid) one time
Closer for the (kid) one time

Talk all subliminal in love with a criminal
It's all coming back to the pot no chemicals
She can get hired on the spot no interviews
No carbs, just vitamins, minerals
Riding shotgun in the coop with the general
You go hard for the kids so I'm into you
Hold you down, that's what I'm feenin' do

Here cause I wanna be not cause I have to be
You the one I wanna be with ma, actually
I knew you were special cause we hit it off naturally
Had your guards up at first now you attached to me
Gotta give you all of me, can't give you half of me
You could take your time girl, we gonna move carefully
A hot bath water, the meals you prepare for me
When nobody else was, you were always there for me
And I love myself just need you to care for me
You done more than enough, I owe you now
So it's only right that I hold you down

I say damn it I let this one get away
She's what I'm wanting and ain't no comparing to you girl
I never played with your heart, concealing games, no need for looking
'Cause there ain't none that hurt you girl

Listen, I ain't trying to play with you, I'm trying to stay with you
Y'a mean, spend forever and a day with you
Never mind them side chicks and they issues
They ain't nothing but bad luck that they wish you
It ain't about them though, it's 'bout the two of us
They can't stand to see us doing us
And I told you this is what I go through
But words can't explain it so that's why now I gotta hold you

Streets taught him well, learnt it until it cost him
Reciprocated the hate and turned it into a fortune
Never woulda tried his hand, but they forced him
So right after they fried his man, then they off'ed him
Yeah you know the trees, the mink stop right below the knees
Four door shit from overseas
Underboss from the other side,
Blame me when you hear that they killed his whole mother's side
Never the money, always for the love of it

Just watch what you say, and watch who you deliver it to
Put something away, cuz you'll never know when it rains

These the different kind of jewels though, that go in your brain

Make saving one of your habits
Never keep the razors and plates under the cabinet
You can get further in life by using manners
Not only are these cellphones tapped they using scanners
Never use your own address, use your nana's
And if you ever have to pull it out, use your hammer
Yeah, white paper or dutch it
Ha, automatic or clutching
Once you put it away don't touch it
Let it come to you don't rush it
Accumulate more than enough shit
Then you get in the building and crush shit

Still squeezing the juice outta the headphones

Put your bottles in the air and make noise wit 'em
Send your girls to the rear and let my boys hit 'em
Fifty large, all hundreds, chip ahoys wit 'em
Cash, full length minks on, all the toys wit 'em
For those not here, for those still employed wit 'em
We celebratin' the times we enjoyed with them
In way, a apart of me was destroyed wit 'em
Tried talking to the Lord, I get annoyed wit 'em
Fiends take a hit and feel like Floyd hit 'em
It was never beef everything was soy wit 'em
Ex rhythm hunter, used to enjoy rhythm,
As the years went by he learned more wisdom
Always kept cigars and burned more ?
We all die the object is to avoid prison
If you aint' paying respect, then you supposed to

There's only two choices, the powder or the hard son
Jada the forefather and Fred the Godfather

All in the connect's ear
Driving cars that come out next year
Block lit, all I did was come out for some fresh air
Big chain, nice watch, fresh gear, heck yeah
Killers respect killers, soft niggas respect fear
Crazy cause I love it but I hate it that I rep there
Sad part about it is that I made it when I left there
Sorry to whoever anticipated my death here
You die, they hope, don't sleep, stay woke
The more money you get, the more it's your fault that they broke
Catch a bullet in your culo
In the hood that's how they do though
'Cause ain't nothin' new, yo

This ain't nothin' new, this ain't nothin' new
Two decker like me man, it's what I do
And you got lied to if they sad to say what I do
This ain't nothin' new, it ain't nothin' new
Nah but maybe to a nigga like you
'Cause round here man, this an everyday thing
No it ain't nothin' new

Never turn down when it's on, I'm front line
Always respected what's real, I want mine
Anytime they shot up the hood was go time
Once you start cuttin' in life, you sold out
If you have some smut on your name, you can't grind
Over reputation and pride we gone die
When the police asked for the truth, I told lies
And when I find God in this booth, my soul cry
Once you off the stoop it's through, you no child
Ain't make no excuse for your youth, or no size
See me, I graduated these streets in 05
Still live and die by these rules, you know why?

Nah the bars are still lethal
You ain't at the top til the stars are underneath you
God shuffles the deck but the cards come from the people
Speakin' from a place where the odds are under equal
Yeah, end of discussion
Ain't nothin' new, I vocally destroy any production
Go get your crew, put my prints on the semi, I'm bustin'
Grateful, I know the difference between plenty and nothin'
I'm on the block, on the crate, sippin' Henny and puffin'
And even though it's all love, keep your enemies lustin'
Lick a shot off then let two go
Let me off the leash, I'm like Cujo
This ain't nothin' new yo

Simple dilemmas become hard for you to cope with
Taking things personal, easily insulted
Doing dumb shit, and don't care what the results is
Ain't scared to die, but you thinking 'bout a coffin
And quitting ain't an option but you think about it often
Saying to yourself, how this ain't fair
You got the strength but the energy, just ain't there
That same vision that you used to have just ain't clear
The storm gets heavier, the sun disappears
You just hoping that there's light, at the end of the tunnel
Either that or oil money at the end of the funnel
Hit a different mind-frame once you been through the jungle
But you can stumble on a hit, and get rich on a humble
Least now you know, they love the style and flow
We almost there, just one more mile to go

First the depression kicks in, then you get animal-like
Hate can turn to motivation if you channel it right

And the work is just keeping my name alive more
All I'm tryna do is finish the game with a high score
I done laughed and cried and then laughed and cried more
And I know what I want, so don't ask cause I'm sure
From a cloth that no longer exists, self cut

Not every don is a don till a don walk in the room

All you want is the shine, but the sun is on strike
The cash comes in then the love stop

Fuck what they be yellin'
Niggas rap about guns and street life
Them niggas be telling
They don't know about real
They ain't even been broke, rob nothing
They ain't never been to jail
They don't know about beef goin' back and forth
Late night, on the block 'til the Mac go off
Nigga just came home, and he back up north
Everybody where you from know your block is soft
Hold up, lemme fill my cup
Let's toast to the boys they ain't never broke up
We done battled everybody and never choked up
All we do it get money, and stay smoked up
I done stuffed my hawk
I park one of you niggas with that industry talk
We the realest everywhere, not just New York
Been eating worldwide, you seen my fork
What you know about me
Street nigga, half the shit I can't IG
Help the cops can't ID
Things my son cannot see
Let the tre pound go
Light up let the whole pound blow
I'm lit you should see my show

Feds is watching why they ain't get ya?
They ain't ya nigga they ain't with ya
You don’t see em and they say they miss you
All the bad luck and hate they wished you
You and your homie different casket same pastor same scripture
I’m in the hood where the drugs is never that far away from where the plug is
Homemade corn liquor in the tub is
Down bottom to its hot where the bugs is
Object is to rise up above this
Why you think all the real niggas love kiss
'Cause the gram got people so caught up with likes
Mafuckas forgot what real love is
Check it
Right off the back of them big 18 wheelers
As soon as I get it it goes to the dealers
They been fucking with us I know that they feel us
Ain't too much say 'cause they know we the realist

Jadakiss,"I’m so high, you can barely see me
Do you know the feeling of being so high?

Between love and hate it’s a fine line
So I stay parallel to the sky line
THC levels is through the roof
When you floating in the clouds you can view the truth
Hush feel the rush from the altitude
Look down on 'em see what they about to do
So you already know what not to do
That Moroccan hashish is like rocket fuel
Yea sometimes it better not to see the ground
Yea sometimes it better not to be around
Always keep a couple dollars and a P around
I might experience turbulence when I see the town
The worlds under me
I’m where the lightning and the thunder be
'Cause down there ain't no fun to me
With that said I ain't going back
I’m bout to blow a sack and I all know is that

I’m so high I can’t see the ground
My life shines so bright can you see me now
Ohh I’m so high I’m not coming down
I won't fade away, this high's gonna stay
I'm so high

Rollin up, money can't folded up
How you gonna say you cold as us
Can’t smoke enough
Diamonds in my chain nah homie it ain't 14 karats
Lil nigga that ain't gold enough
Staying on top while these haters praying I stop and
You niggas waiting on cars while I pull em strain out the lot
You could catch me rolling up reefer, I stay on that pot
And I’m always repping for my gang I know I say that a lot
'Cause I can remember the days before I got paid
Me and my niggas was trying to make our way
We getting on fuck what y'all say
Made some millions and got niggas with me tryna do the same thing
So I made moves bossed up in the game
Ball hard don’t get crossed up in the game
Seen alotta dudes get loss up in the game
That’s why every time you see me

I’m so high I can’t see the ground
My life shines so bright can you see me now
Ohh I’m so high I’m not coming down
I won't fade away, this high's gonna stay
I'm so high

High as the towers before they knocked them down
Teflon like Gotti before they locked him down
Word to the mollies niggas in poppin now
But I’m just chillin just passing the pot around

I’m so high I can’t see the ground
My life shines so bright can you see me now
Ohh I’m so high I’m not coming down
I won't fade away, this high's gonna stay
I'm so high",So High

We don’t ride how you niggas ride
Politics to the side no one sicker than I
First the devil will try to conquer
Then he’ll divide
It’s my job as a man
To forever provide
What's the meaning of living
Since you barely survive
If you came from the dirt
Now you touching the sky
You keep fucking wit me
You must be rushing to die
So you better decide
'Cause it's better to ride
I'm 2 slots after the 3rd dead or alive
You can give me the racks instead of the shine
'Cause I been doin' what I'm doin' ahead of my time
If you ain't hearin' what I'm doin' you better rewind
The only thing I'm scared of doin' is federal time
I sold crack out the building several dimes
And I done counted up a million several times
Gold plated desert eagles incredible nines
Better flows better fabrics better designs
Family and loyalty
Then the cheddar behind
I put some money on ya head
Or some bread on ya mind
We ya problem alone
But we better combined
Do it for those not here
And forever confined
And we ain't promised tomorrow
So lets treasure the times
And we ain't givin it away
So lets measure the lines
And keep killin these niggas
The pleasure is mines
We get better with time
So you better resign
Yea
Before death be the treasure you find

Throw a gun in the sky get ya money and slide
But keep in mind, still ride or die

What really make you the Top 5
Cannot lie dead or alive you cannot find bars better than mine

Ain't gon' never hustle hard as me

It’s the angels versus the reaper
You might not know but it gets deeper
You heard my name on the last verse of Ether
You gotta come to the hood if you want to reach us
I’ll lay you down in the earth right underneath us
Same town just the poor parts
'Cause the beggers will disappear when the war starts
I’m still out here dog I got war scars
You know me I’m from the bottom where the floor starts
When you're street smart, money's your report card
I got the deck now I can pull a boss card (Top 5)

Just listen, just listen
I'm giving you the blueprint to get it out here
And you don't wanna do what it takes
You wanna stay on your Instagram all day
Take motherfuckin' selfies
And you ain't hustlin' hard, bitch

Yeah, by any means whatever it takes
More or less life or death whatever the case
Its all about your stamina its never the race
Re the bank back up if ever you ace
Hate so official they try offending you
When you die they don’t miss you they just remember you
I sat down with the devil and did an interview
I shot rounds with the rebels I’m with the criminals
I put an end to you I save all the small talk for the interludes
I ain't finna loose I’m in a winning mood
I’m with the winning dudes we good in every hood

Jade Warrior,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window 
Staring at a son that she just can't touch.
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side, 
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all, 
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,
Another body laying cold in the gutter.
Listen to me.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation, 
But he just can't see.
She give him loving that his body can't handle, 
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me.""
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror, 
But he doesn't recognize his own face.
His health is fading and he doesn't know why.
Three letters took him to his final resting place.

But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.

Jaded Thorns,"I am drifting here, alone and incomplete.
Searching for the other part of me, for my missing peace.
All the ways I""ve known, the paths I used to seek,
Every one of them seems empty now.
No more within my reach.
Now there's something, I feel something.
Yes there's something stirring
Just beneath the surface,
Of all I thought I knew lies the naked truth,
Of who I am and what I'm coming to.

As I grope within this suffocating silence,
I feel you calling me to you now.
I hear your voice and then; I feel there's something,
Now there's something, yes there's something stirring...
When I look into your eyes, I see myself within.
Can I reach beyond this empty life?
When I look into your eyes, the darkness seems to fade.
What' s past is gone, I finally see the truth.",Drifting

Covarde morre gritando, o valente sem gemer!

É preciso muita garra pra subir os degraus da glória
Como farofa e areia, dou a mão à palmatória

You're not exactly the guy I can bring home to my mama
But what she don't know won't hurt her
You're so controlling, so demanding,
Like to take advantage of me,
But I don't mind, no sir.


You get under my skin, such a sweet sin
Just like a disease that keeps on, keeps on eating at me,
I know good and well you're good for nothing
They say you don't deserve me
But it really don't disturb me.


Why do all good girls like the bad boys?
Like a moth to a flame, I guess I'm back here again.
Tell me why the dark side just captures my eye,
I know that you're a villain but I can't stop this feeling.

No Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (x2)

You're cocky and its working,
Chauvinistic and its perfect,
M-m-must be something wrong with me
I-I-I use to think that I was strong,
But I now I see how I was wrong
Because you took control of me

She can't stop this feeling no, I tell her go with the flow righttt,
Say little mama want to know why the good girls like the bad boys,
Bad meaning good, shawty left with no choice,
So over your skin, baby phat you're so moist,
Leaving with the tins, when I'm macking invoice,
My laptop bling and a boy can't avoid
She love it going in, she don't want to be unemployed,
One reason to be a good pleasin',
Freaking daddy's little girl like I'm halfway decent,
Sure it ain't a lesson that I maybe been teaching,
Party all night and keep preaching.

Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet

Jae-P,"Yo this song's going out to all the little homies out
There
That are thinking of getting into trouble
Hope this song makes you think

En medio del pasillo me sentia bien perdido
Pasaba todo el mundo estaba enloquesido
Sacaba mi coraje peleando con mi hermana
Pensaba en matarme
Mi vida es nada
Sin poder entender
Bajo mi ignorianca mi jefita sufrira
Por toda mi infancia
Un dia me sento
Me dijo ""No seas pendejo tu crees que a mi
Me gusta andar limpiando espejos
Tu sabes de la vida""me dijo mi jefita
Deja de fumar why tambien esa bebida
Si no te compones preso iras a terminar
Por tu propia voluntad te iras a destrozar
Why esos amigitos que se dicen ser familia
No mas lo que te enseñan son puras grocerias
Dime cuantas veces te an resado un Rosario
No mas lo que te enseyan es como ser un vago.""

(Coro)
Perdoname Ama no te quise lastimar
Me quisiste avisar no te pude escuchar
Perdoname Ama no te quise lastimar
El amor que tu me diste no lo voy encontrar

Me mandaban al la escuela,me pintiaba con los Homies
En la casa de mi amigo me pasaba tome why tome
Le entrabamos a todo, no teniamos perdon
El jefe de la banda era yo el mas chingon
Pero todo llego al fin la lana se acabo
Quise hacer un jale, asaltar la liquor store
No quise usar mi cuete pero George se acelero
Le metio un cuetazo al Chino why al piso se callo
En medio de la preda no supe que paso
Corri pa' el otro lado why la juda me alcanzo
Me dijo no te muevas o te trueno aqui pelon
Despues de ese dia otra vida empezo
Cuando hiba en la patrulla pense en mi jefita
Hora si la regue se va queder solita
Yo me acuerdo que mi abuelo me dicia
""No seas bruto No ay pandilla ni homeboy
Que te saque de ese pulcro""

(Coro)

Encerrado en la pinta el resto de mi vida
Sufri un gran dolor por fallarle a mi jefita
Ya no se que hacer mi vida esta perdida
Pagare las consecuencias,ya no habra salida
En la calle fui Chingon pero aqui no valgo nada
Soy un simple numero como otros camaradas
Aunque no fue mi culpa yo no quise ir a matar
Si andas en pandillas lo mismo te ira a pasar
Hoy encarselado pensando en que hacer
Si me hubiera yo quedado a estudiar a hacer el bien
Por eso yo les digo sigan buenos pasos
Ay que hacer cumplidos pues sigan estudiando
Destroce el corazon de mi madre
La que me dio su sangre
La que me dio a luz why me quito pues el hambre
Sufrire toda mi vida,aqui conocere la muerte
Solo Dios sabra como aqui corre mi suerte

Partido tengo el corazón estoy herido
Por que me miras tanto
Y no me das mas un simple hola, como estas?

Me estas volviendo loco
Enloquecer ver que tu
No puedes ser mi mujer
Dia y noche pienso solo en ti
No me puedo enfocar baby

Lucho entenderte para poder conciliar mi frustración
En no tener tus labios para que me des
Un besito chiquita porfavor te necesito

Te necesito a mi lado para siempre
Te necesito en mi vida lo mas urgente
Te necesito como quiero estar contigo
Te necesito no me dejes en el olvido

El otro dia que picardia
Que no se diga tu estabas
En el cine y no sabias

Que atras de ti yo estava muy calladito
Espiando para ver que requisito
Si no eres para mi dimelo ya basta con
Los juegos chiquita

Tu sonrisa y tu aroma alimenta
A mi pobre corazón que no encuentra
El amor en este triste universo
Chiquita por favor haz un esfuerzo
Por que vida sin ti no ay apetito
Reyna de mi corazon te necesito

Te necesito los 7 dias de la semana
Te necesito mi corazon no te engaña
Te necesito cada vez que yo respiro
Te necesito ya no puedo estar herido

Me pierdo caminando pensando en ti
Cada paso que doy no estas ahi
Admito que estoy enamorado
Vaya a donde vaya estoy juzgado

Ya no quiero aguantar este dolor
Mi cara ha perdido su color
Me arrepiento del dia en que te vi
Caminando a dos pasos de mi

No tuve el valor en decirte con miedo
Que podia aburrirte
Por que el amor que tengo
Es infinito darling
Entiende te necesito

Te necesito a mi lado para siempre
Te necesito en mi vida lo mas urgente
Te necesito como quiero estar contigo
Te necesito no me dejes en el olvido

Te necesito los 7 dias de la semana

Te necesito cada vez que yo respiro

Todos nos dicen no nos quieren aqui
Hey think without a Mexican you will be feliz
Pasen sus leyes, dijanos mojados

Hay muchos mas estados donde hemos llegado
No nos quieren dar licencia ni siquiera un ID
Pero cobran sus impuestos cada 15 de abril

Mas fuerza nos daremos pa' seguir luchando

Conozco a otro a un mas peor
Le decimos el paisano simplemente de cariño
A veces discrimina peor que un gringo

No es fiel a su pasado, chicano equivocado
Tuvo la fortuna de llegar antes que yo
De Juan se hizo Jonhs se le olvido el español

También en la familia hay celos y envidia
En vez de ayudarnos tapamos la salida
Competimos por la chamba

Solo asi conquistaremos that's right
No hay raza mejor que la mia

Tenemos el deber de mejorar este pais
Mostrar nuestra cultura y la manera de vivir

No dejar que taco bell represente al Mexicano
Que nuestros hijos no abandonen su pasado
Que se vayan de casita cuando es hora de estudiar
No importa solo asi van a triunfar

Que terminen la high school y la universidad
Que no se rompan la espalda, al trabajar
Unidos no vencidos, a lo que venimos
Hace falta plata en el pais, buscar otro camino

Es gacho pero cierto pa' el gobierno de aqui
Nos es suficiente que suframos, nos quieren destruir

And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
 
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend",Tu Amigo Fiel
Jag Panzer,"[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

When your love exists no more it's time to find another door
Rekindling flames that have gone dim, let feelings spread on a whim
Look toward the light and fix your eyes, let the white dove fly
When your love exists no more it's time to find another door

Hearts are dry it's time they burn
The wheel of life has stopped its turn
Pound the flesh unto the tree
Bound and hung before me
Cast your lots unto him now
Search your hearts before the bow
Life's too short, why throw away
Save the best for the final day

Bleed into the world of sin
The blood will flow to the hearts within
Agonizing pain and death
Well, it's burning everything that's left
Kneel before the one so true
He's the king of all and even you
Darkness ruling everyone
Praising another as the one true son

Burn his number into the flesh
666 the final test
See the mark sweep the land
On the forehead, on the hand
Hang the one that we all know
Crucify the inner soul
Sell your soul unto the maker
The Crucifix




",The Crucifix
Jag Panzer,"Scrambled signals on the radio
Orders are given to attack
Flames light the sky from over the hill
No time for turning back
Well, the blood lust runs cold inside my veins
Twisting tormenting my mind
I feel a scream from deep inside
It lets me know I'm the killin' kind

Gonna yell, unleash this demon rage
Scream, I'm a tiger in a cage
Yell, I'm on the prowl again
Scream

A soldier on the streets somewhere in L.A.
Preparing this night for the attack
Swinging chains and switchblade knives
Feel the nails in my baseball bat
Well, I love to fight, I love to screw
Feel my heat begin to rise
Don't walk the street at night, my friend
Or you're in for a surprise

Playing on the sheets of untold sin
Who can tell what the darkness withholds
Spread your wings and we can fly
Bodies ready to explode
Touch me, thrill me, you can scratch me, love
Get me in your stranglehold
Well, you make me moan, I'll make you yell
Passions uncontrolled, uncontrolled",Licensed to Kill

The master of games for what they are worth
One with the darkness, one with my soul

Out bursting with rage
Overflowing force of desire

Cast all inhibitions in the fire

Jag Panzer,"I've walked into the light on the other side
Beyond the door of life I've left behind
Followed a path I did not know
Washed by many tears
Read the pages of my life
Retraced the wasted years
that scarred my soul
Now I must go, someone calls me
Someone is tugging at my soul
Won't let go. Let me go!

When the seal is opened on the book of life
Will your name be written there?
To be remembered and follow into the light
Or cast down in despair

Sign of the times and things yet to come
The truth now revealed
Shall condemn every son
Some will be blessed
Others turned away
Who will be honored on judgement day?

Time is now...To face your fears
Time has come...Wash away the tears
Time is now...For all to kneel
Time has come...Judgement you will feel

In my vision every head and hand
Will retain some kind of code
Inventory read by a laser scan
For everything bought or sold

Accept the way...Come get in line
Accept the new age...Don't be left behind
Accept the way...Do it now today
Accept the new age...Or be cast away

One monetary system for the world
A do or die sort of thing
All computations flowing through the beast
Have we forgotten who is king?

Show me the sign, the sign of the times
It's time for a sign

The press of a key is easy for me
That's the way it should be
What is the cost? Will I be lost?
To the hands of the beast

Show me the sign, the sign of the times
It's time for a sign
Don't be afraid The future is paved
The mark's on it's way

Bank by the phone you'll never leave home
A scan is all you'll need
Automation in every nation
The future is ours to be

Hope you don't turn it down they just put on our jam
And I've been watchin' you til everybody know all night

Not to long ago, when I need you
You were nowhere, I couldn't find you
But now you want me, I don't wanna
Be nowhere that you can see me
So if you ever come my way
Turn and walk away

It's funny how, it's funny how

See you always so dear to me
But then things change
You shade away
I need to know why they changed
And why they couldn't stay the same
Somebody take away the rain and
Give me back my sunny days

Everything goes wrong (go wrong)

It's funny how
Everyone's gone (their gone)
It's funny how, it's funny how

It's funny how
When you need your friends their gone
It's funny how suddenly things turned wrong
It's funny how, it's funny how
Things never go your way

Need a nigga call anytime, I'll be there for y'all.

Sometimes you need someone to be with,
But your private side just won't let you.
How can I show that I love you so?
And I care about everythang that happens to you.

So tell me, do you have someone who you can call on?
Do you have somone that you trust?
And will they always be around you to protect you?
Will they be around when you need them the most?

When you're feeling low, nowhere to go,
You can call me, I'll be right there.
When you're feeling down, no one's around,
You can call me, I'll be right there.

I know what you, you need from me.
If you dial the phone, I'll make you see.
No one can do the things
That I'll do for you, that's that.
Give me that chance and I bet I can ease your mind

'Cause every day that I live
It seems I learn a lot more about women in general
They just want to be loved, just want to be hugged and kiss, be included
Every heart got a glitch
Every dog got it's bitch
Every man got a whip
Mine is you, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Can we be tight?
I want to be there for you all I can
Can we be tight again?
I know you just got over your man
Can we be tight?
I tried to ask you time and time again
Can we be tight again?
Again, again

(Repeat 2X)
Can we be, can we be tight
Messed up in the past
And baby now I know better
Can we be, can we be tight
Give me one more chance
Girl I know I'll do it better

Can we be tight?
I want to be there for you all I can
Can we be tight again?
I know you just got over your man
Can we be tight?
I tried to ask you time and time again
Can we be tight again?

Jagged Edge,"J-E y'all 
y'all know, yeah, yeah check this out
(Cut something, cut something)
We gonna let you in on a little Southern lingo
(Cut something, cut something)
Is that what they saying?
(Cut something, cut something)
(Cut something on the low-low)

[Ludacris]
Check it out
Cut a nigga for the low-low
I'm fixin' to cut a nigga from the So So
I heard you cut a nigga from the DTP, you got DDT
From College Park to the DEC
See we be sittin' on low pros
Shippin' ass in by the boatloads
Not many people can see the cheese
Better run they g's
Ludacris and the Pimp MC's, JE

[JE]
To all of y'all who don't know
Let me explain
What cuttin' is, and how it go
Gotta know the game
Cause you can say the wrong thing
To the wrong girl, with the wrong man
And, let's just say it might be a long night

The first thing you should know
Do she get down?
Now if she's even feeling you
Is she worth your while?
Had this girl I met the other day
She was feelin' me, I was feelin' her
And I couldn't believe what she said

She said cut something
She looked at me, I looked at her
I said ""Ain't Nothin""
Couldn't believe what I just heard
She was not frontin'
I like my woman kind of bold
She was oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
She said cut somethin'
I'm peepin' you, you're peepin' me
So let's stop playin'
She said ""You ain't never had a girl like me""
Who will make you feel like this
So we can go after the show
Baby cut something, we should cut something
Don't be scared

See usually I never mess with a girl who steps
Up to me before I even get the chance
Let a woman be a woman, let a man be a man see
And that's the way I like it baby
Now I always make exceptions to every rule
This one I had to let on in, she was hella cool
She liked to do things that men would really want and
This is what she said, hey

[Chorus]

A lot of things have changed in life
Cause now women go out on the prowl
Baby harder than men
I know when I figured it out
When this girl walked up
She said cut something, something
Ain't like I'm trippin' about it
I just remember when a man could be a man baby
And yes, I still can't believe what she said

[Ludacris]
Yo she said she needed me to beat it
And beat it, beat it, then skeet it
She greeted with an open tongue
With Coke and Rum, got her so excited
She screamin' at the top of her lungs
She just can't hide it
I'm poppin' her gums, cock my popular gun
Shoot, shoot, lick, lick from the head to the toes
Head to the floor, head till their ain't no head no mo'
Cut till it ain't no bed no mo'
Cut till you pussy don't beg no mo'

When the Remy's in the system, it ain't no telling

Even though I know, that ain't what I need
I can't take the nagging and the bitching and the screaming
No matter what I do it just ain't enough
You say I don't take you out and buy you stuff
But you got these things, provided by me
Somebody pass me the VSOP

I need a drink 'cause you're driving me to drink
Two shots of attic and I ain't even gotta think about

But girl I can't go out like that 

Come home from a long day
Instead of having dinner ready 
All you got is something to say
Going on like I need that
I'm doing all I can and you can keep that
Said I never met no girl like you

Then I'd be down on my knees saying girl don't you leave
But I know that I've done gave it all I got, all I got
I damn near done broke my back
So go ahead with all of that
Cause if you really, really want to know
Why I prefer that you just pack your things and go

Did we have to say all those things that we said last night
Baby I don't wanna say goodbye
So I'm just standing here wondering why
Just don't like to see when you cry
So I'ma say goodbye

If you think I 'cause I packed your stuff
That inside I ain't really really cracking up
'Cause you're wrong, I just hide it good
'Cause I know that's what you need

Cause I know all things ain't perfect
But in my heart you're worth it
I hope you change your mind

I was at the bar, sippin' and I'm leanin'
I just, had to get attention, but didn't wanna mention
How, she just wasn't lookin'
And this ain't what I'm feelin'
Now, movin' on, to bout to have you later
And now, she's my girl, I knew that I wasn't playin' and its

Sweat, in the car, driving as fast as we can go
She's gonna be all on me, kissin' me touching me
I don't wanna stop right now, she doesn't wanna stop neither

Fall to the waist, I grace, I cry
Lifeless, lemme add some color to that shine

Some old fools bubblin' and that's what we becomin'
See, you used to be comin', when the engine was runnin'
Now ? and you ain't that woman
Mmm, damn, I hate that frontin'
I hate just bumpin' in just case you was wondering

Droppin' tops and way more, hot like car show

Sometimes its way to much.

Gotta job, I got dough, 
What I need wit a hoe? 
I wanna girlfriend. 
A real woman who knows how to please me, 
Shes makes it so easy. 
At the end of the day we all wanna get a little freaky. 
I got dinner on the table, 
We goin' have to warm it up. 
Cause when you get here, 
I'ma give you all the love that I have in me, 
Baby all I need is your attention please. 

Feel a rush when you sleep, 
Cause I cant get enough, 
Of you just loving me. 
Sometimes its way too much. 
Body so right, I know I'd be wrong
If I didn't wanna do you like all night long. 
It's your touch and your kiss, 
Something I don't wanna miss. 
Its your skin, its your lips, 
It feels like such a gift. 
If it's up to me we'd be here the whole night through, 
Till the morning

In the morning, when we wake up, 
You'll be lookin' at me so peacefully, 
Like this is where I need to be. 
In the morning when we wake up we'll be together together, 
You know there's nothing better. 
In the morning when we wake up, 
You'll be looking at me so peacefully 
Got your day started so crazy, 
Baby, you know, 
There ain't nothin' like just bein' with you.
In the morning

I love how you look, 
Even when you get up.
You're so lovely with them rolleres and no makeup . 
And I cant believe at the end of the day, 
I still gotta say that you're my special lady. 
The mornings kinda tough,
With no coffee in my cup. 
The way that you be loving me, 
Its hard to just get up. 
I cant start my day alone. 
There's is nothing like just being with you 
In the morning

Feel a rush when you sleep, I can't get enough. 
When you're loving me, sometimes its way too much. 
I know I'd be wrong if I didn't take care of you. 
I know I'd be wrong if I didn't want to marry you.
It's your touch and your kiss, 
Something I don't wanna miss. 
Its your skin, its your lips, 
It feels like such a gift.

Day or night baby, I'll be yours. 
But in the morning,

I cant make a day at my job long, 
Without trying to run home. 
Phone it gets gets me all the way through the day, 
But it gets me half way.

I'ma be right at home.

Man I swear I'll keep her down.
This girl, she's so amazing
She's everything I dreamed that a woman could be
She sends all of my senses into a whirlwind
'Cause it's her eyes and her smell that gets me.
And I think that I could be with her
If I could tell her how I feel
I'll let her know that this thang that I feel is real
If I could find the words that'll put her down
Man I swear I'll keep her down, down

Spring Breakin' with my dawgs I was on her
Didn't give a chance to let another dude get one her
Why'all know i came with my mack game, hood like a crap game
I caught her her early I was sober

That meant my thoughts going right and my words flowin' nice and
When she movin' got me on the fly
Get ready for take off them clothes got to break off
Got her gigglin' and laughin' and I know she knows what's happening
She can tell by the way I'm rapping, gotta rap this up baby that's wuts up

She like a girl gone wild,
can't miss the girl she stand out in the crowd and
young & sexy with the freaky freaky style
Walked in the party, make the club buck wild hey
Little Mama she like a girl gone wild, her and all her girls stand out in the crowd
Young & sexy with that freaky freaky style
Walked through the party make the club buck wild
Hey Hey, yeah yeah yeah yeah

When I met her she was sipping a Corona
And i was really really feeling her persona
From that moment on i knew she was a goner (didn't have a chance)
By the way she walked, I had to put it on her

'Cause I gets down like a stickup, everybody put yout hands up
See I ain't tryna hurt nobody
But I was taken by her bangin' body
Loving her can really be my hobby

I got her laughin', I'm about to cash in

 Come in as is, doo-rags and Tims
 I'm rollin past his, his little Jag and Benz
 With the Rolls, not the one with the stem (the one with the rims)
 The one that seem to make more enemies than friends
 I'm slidin in past doors, both eyes closed
 Both arms rose, both charms froze
 With the S-O-S-O, D-E dot F
 I'm buyin bottles, bottles, until it ain't none left
 I'm quick to go left, I blaze with no rep
 I jams more than def, baby show me the club
 I'm like ""hey, where that Bacardi at?""
 Come and mix it with the Cris', baby, what's wrong with that?
 We in the V.I.P. twisted, down right spliffed it
 Two way and shit, ooh they makin like they missed it

Seen her straight from the back
Couldn't wait for this girl to turn around

Had the skin perfect match that
She round in the back you know I likes that
Trying to floss like a movie
Anything so she don't lose me

Jagged Edge,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

With yesterday

We had a love for all seasons
At least that's how it used to be
There was no time, space, or reason
More special to us than we
My love continued to flourish
As a flower blooms in spring
Then you tried to play love for silly
But the loser is the fool who doesn't play
Love by the rules

If she breaks your heart
I will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you
Cause I may not be around to do the things 
I used to do
And if you awake to find you're lost
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way 
Cause the love I felt inside
Has gone away with yesterday

My love is gone with yesterday, my love is gone
With yesterday

There was a time when forever
Was common-place for me and you
Laughing, loving, sharing, caring
Seemed to be made just for us two
But I kept on building the dream world
That I thought was you and I
Sorry, I'm sadly mistaken
Cause our castle in the sky
Has turned into a mere goodbye

If she breaks your heart
I will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you
Cause I may not be around to do the things 
I used to do
And if you awake to find you're lost
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way

Cause the love I felt inside
Has gone away with yesterday

Buckshot:

I woke up in the night
grabbed my forehead
wipe my forehead with the sweat on to the bed
Deep inside thought
thinking of a way to strapped
and walk the streets without getting clapped
Just because I'm tieing the fuzz growing in my buzz
I'm doing my justice, bust this slug to the ignorant
Who said I didn't have knowledge of self
So come and feel the wrath
So listen
First of all let me explain
That when i drop a rhyme I I make it hard enough to gain
The god is heavy
I blow you up like dynamite
Into my dome I let the L ignite
Fight, I take you on flight here
The war starts here.

BCC:
See we murder MC's every day,
motherfuckers don't play,
straight from the Bucktown side of the block
Keep your shit hot
Like we said, That's when all the madness stops

Verse 2
Buckshot:
To all the Godz who know who's the coloured man
the colored man is the obvious, you understand?
I kill him, and drill 'I'm in my bootcamp
Who can't survive in the creek?
You can't
Champion, bootcampian click
stick and move
I bust your shit
Move and stick
It's the original crook
Stomping through your army, what!
Gortex to your head
Keep your eyes shut
But, I'll take you in consideration
My occupation is to bust your federation
with my ammunition
Flipping precision, being precise
He's right, I'm nice
You can check my status and my apparatus
See the baddest Buckshot shot the boodah
Murder hero to clean your pipe like Ruger
Smoke a bag of charm then I drop the bomb,
Buckshot I represent the Arm Leg Leg Arm
Head, natty dread, boy big him up
Roll thick like syrup
cause chaos and terror

Chorus

I had a vision
It appeared to me in the form of a devil
but the rebel wasn't there to see
for me this is the year to be
the son of the seven, representing the sea
the heatseeker
the cypher maker
quick to take a
sec to re-a-lize, I burn right through you
Double gauge
I'm pointing the rage at your culu
....
We blew the motherfucker
Now we outta here.

It was 1:30, my face was all dirty trying to get some sleep

Two dots yes I'm coming, yes my car is running, hang up my cell phone

By the time I arrived you was deep about five like you had beef
And then you tried to step and told me that I slept like you was cock deez
It was all about some niggaz that you thought was jigga
Who was digging me and I told you after that day we ain't cool baby, so

I was trying to be nice for your own advice
Ooh girl you don' did it now, really, really, really did it now watch out

I was kinda thrown head was kinda blown but I'm not blue
Lost a couple friends once or twice before, I'm still cool
Then you tried to flex like you were the next bitch who you trying to fool
You just another girl from the avenue who graduated school

Now you wanna be down after you tried to clown me baby doll
But ain't no future in fronting and frontiers
Don't hang around with me at all

But she bout' to get a beatin' performed

Cool her out try to tell her to chill, lower the thermostat

Scrapping over men is best avoided
And a real lady would never confess to doing it
She said I'm ganstar don't let the dress confuse you
The only things sweet is the music, it's really not a game

And every time that your?re broke, I pay you money just to leave me alone
Why I don't understand that you ain't no kind of man
Giving me grabbing my clothes, I guess I don't get enough

Every time you hurt me I don't know
Why I can't throw your clothes out the window
Every time I try to be strong and let you go
You start talking sweet to me like I was your ho

I was six years old when I fell down on Spencer Ave.
It was my aunt suzy?s house and I still can see the bruise
I remember grand daddy even though I never sat on his knee

He taught me life was culture baby
My uncle David they call him Jello the only man that could say hello
And it sound like angels singing in your ear
And even though they all passed away I still long for their company
And I wonder God why couldn't they stay

So I gotta remember though I'm young that my time will surely come
And now I gotta try to keep it together as I watch my family pass me by
So remember, so remember, so remember 
So remember, so remember, so remember
So remember, so remember, so remember 
So remember, so remember, so remember your family

I was twelve years old when my uncle Andrew had got sick
And Jaundice turn to HIV and then his body quit
It was strange the numbness I felt, watching him all dressed in black
wasn't thinking about what he gave up but about all I lacked

So I gotta believe, that if I give I can live through eternity
And I gotta know, if I don't share myself know one will ever know
So remember, so remember, so remember 
So remember, so remember, so remember
So remember, so remember, so remember 
So remember, so remember, so remember your family

[Repeat: x 2]
I always yeah remember what my mama told me
I always yeah, always take the bitter with the sweet
I always yeah, remember what auntie told me
I always yeah, even when it?s hard be a lady baby
I always yeah, remember what grand daddy said
I always yeah, you got to lay in the bed you make
I always yeah, remember what my uncle taught me
I always yeah, don't give up when it gets hard keep pushing baby
And you got to, remember everything they taught you
And you got to, hold on to what is true
And you got to, never forget where you coming from
And you got to, and you got to, and remember

Cuando el venado baila alrededor del fuego
Y logra cruzar el cielo
Suele purificarse un alma raptada
Por el maldito viento de una miserable rata

Cuando el núcleo escupió a los cielos
Llovieron meses de horribles especies
Plagando la tierra de demonios sonrientes
Gestando falsas caras de inocentes víctimas

Cuando arriba en la montaña
Baila un guerrero noches enteras
Las falsas víctimas lloran por regresar al infierno

Me lamo las heridas y duermo por días

You left a hole in the back of my head

The problems which confront us today are unprecedented 
They have no counterparts in human experience 
Men search the pages of history for solutions, for precedents, but there are none
This, then, is the ultimate challenge
Where are we to look for our survival?
For the answers to the questions which have never before been posed?

We must look, first, to Almighty
Who has raised man above the animals and endowed him with intelligence and reason
And we must look into ourselves, into the depth of our souls 
We must become something we have never been
And for which our education and experience and environment have ill-prepared us 
We must become bigger than we have been
More courageous, greater in spirit, larger in outlook
We must become members of a new race, overcoming petty prejudice 
Owing our ultimate allegiance not to nations but to our fellow men within the human community",Hardcore

That got your friends going out on a limb
Sliding me numbers when you ain`t watching them
Playing me close but I`m not feeling them

Or large amounts up in my bank account
You tell me you love me baby but what`s that all about

Soft and swingin' from right to left
Get it anyway you like it from front to back
However you want it I can handle that

Now I'd be the first to admit it
Had me straight flippin' out when a nigga hit it
See love was so right
Ass was so tight..

Let me make love to you for the last time, baby
Want to cherish each moment like the last
'Cause baby, you're all that I have
So just in case

Think of how we made love almost anywhere
Haven't I taken you almost everywhere
Think of all the things that, that we shared
And imagine me not there, oh, oh

Giving you more carrots than a rabbit, got you living lavish
Anything I've got, you can have it, baby I'll do magic
I'll do all I can, to keep you satisfied
So just in case I don't make it home tonight, baby

Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Let me make love to you for the last time, baby
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
'Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case

Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Let me make love to you for the last time, baby
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
'Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case

Haven't I made you feel so special?
As your man I've held your hand, never letting go
Let you hold the keys to the Lex, huh to drive
Gave you all you need and more as long as I'm alive

Even from the heavens up above, I'll shine out our love
Too much is never enough, oh, you're all I want
Even when I'm gone, your love will carry on
It's just that strong, so just in case

Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Let me make love to you for the last time, baby
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
'Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case

Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Let me make love to you for the last time, baby
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
'Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case

Baby, you know I love you
More than anything in this whole world
You're my anything, my everything, my wife, my queen
So if something happens to me, there's something you need to know

Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Let me make love to you for the last time, baby
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
'Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case

Just in case I don't make it home tonight
Let me make love to you for the last time, baby
Wanna cherish each moment like the last
'Cause baby you're all that I have, so just in case

Jaheim,"Yeah
So you want drama huh?
We can do this
Well well well well well
I heard you've been poppin lip
Talking slick
If you want it you can get it we can handle this
My shorty keep telling me you're stressing her out
You need to relax before I go up in ???
I'm not the one to be played with
Your loose-ass lips will get your dome split
You're getting me steamed and you don't want to do that
You mess around and make me have to wile out and snap

I think you better let it go
Heard you been creeping round my baby's back though
Now what you sliding through here for?
I think you better let it go
I think you want to let it be (be)
'cause if you want beef I got the recipe
Now you don't really want no parts of me
I think you better let it be (let it be)
Can't believe you came here, thinking bout what's gone
What the Hell is wrong with you son? Best be moving on
Before you go, gotta let you know
See those excuses you was using, you can't come here with that there no more
She's been around the house, stacking what you bought,
Everything you own is on the back porch,
You're breaking the rules, kid I've had enough
I'm bout to start hooking off with jabs and upper cuts
What? What? What? What?

Wilin' over this chick Ja, Slow you illin'
Probably be the next book by Terry McMillan
Open off of Hennessey, seeing the remedy,
Ready to pop ?em both like, like they breaking and entry,
It's Tempting, they'll turn your last name Simpson,

If he don't listen, air him out

It's what a playa about. Cash flow

Girl I hope that you are soon to see 
That you and I were meant to be baby

See I refuse to let you down

So full of drama want you tell me 
What it's all about 
I put a time I make you mine 
Could of bounced on you girl 
But your ass is to fine 
Never thought that I'll be loving you 
You got me feeling girl 
I'm stuck on you 

[Chorus]",Looking for Love
Jaheim,"I sing this song...to remind me...of a love.
I wish i knew then... what I should a known a long time ago.

Love is not a game
That you play
To win or lose
No baby

Only if I knew
Then what I know now
You'd still be mine
But we can work it out

Without a doubt
'Cause love is still here
Because my love is still here",Love Is Still Here
Jaheim,"Baby I'm Ready and willing cause I'm able
To satisfy your fantasy.
Baby I'm able and willing cause I want it
You can get just what you need.

For once I'm a young man and
I'm taking the time to do things right.
Keeping you satisfied all through
The night.
Twice I've let you slide
I just wait for the ride
And I didn't put pressure on you
I stood by your side.

I just wanna let you know
That I'm ready to do all the things
You want me to ( yes I am baby oh oh yeah)
And if you don't mind
Baby let's take it easy tonight
Let's slow it down to my pace
Love is all up in you face.

Baby I'm Ready and willing cause I'm able
To satisfy your fantasy.
Baby I'm able and willing cause I want it
You can get just what you need.

Now wait a minute baby,
Slow it down to my speed
Haven't I always given you
Everything you need
But now it's time girl
To lay it all on the line
I don't wanna get fast with you baby
I spend too much time
Just trying to get to know you better
Since you finally sent the lovely letter (Lovely Letter)
Take you out to dance
All of that romance
Do though things you like
Stood right by your side
If you wanna make it right girl
Just let me inside of your world

While love is just want to smack and smash that ass 
Kick it fast

Too much of a thug nigga to tell you I love you
I know I made mistakes
Here hoping and prayin that it aintoo late
Thought I had my game tight
Thought I had it locked down, knowing shit wasn't right
Now you want to blow
Before I let you go
Something you just gotta know

Ain't nothing stopping me from getting backtight with you
Go head and trip you got the right to
If I gotta roll up my sleeves and fight for you
I'll stand outside in the rain all night for you

Ain't nothing stopping me from getting backtight with you
Go head and trip you got the right to
If I gotta roll up my sleeves and fight for you
I'll stand outside in the rain all night

Three months three weeks two days its the same shit
Shorty she ain't haven't it
Back then I wasn't serious
Makin' so much paper kept me curious
Chickens cluckin' everywhere I didn't care
Thinking to myself that you'd always be here
Instead of makin' love to you lady
I would rather be out pushin' my Mercedes

Ain't nothing stopping me from getting backtight with you
Go head and trip you got the right to
If I gotta roll up my sleeves and fight for you
I'll stand outside in the rain all night for you

Ain't nothing stopping me from getting backtight with you
Go head and trip you got the right to
If I gotta roll up my sleeves and fight for you
I'll stand outside in the rain all night for you

If the sun was to fall and the stars was to lose their shine
Id be content with it all as long as your by my sidegirl
Through the good through the bad through it all gonna need your back
Ill always be with you just want to please you

Ain't nothing stopping me from getting backtight with you
Go head and trip you got the right to
If I gotta roll up my sleeves and fight for you
I'll stand outside in the rain all night for you

Ain't nothing stopping me from getting backtight with you
Go head and trip you got the right to
If I gotta roll up my sleeves and fight for you
I'll stand outside in the rain all night for you",Backtight
Jaheim,"So burgundy, the window to his soul
It seems he tapes his eyes closed,
From huffin' on, that's what he's puffin on.
His style is rough, he wears his hair in cornrows,
His jeans hang loose and low
So his di, opps he can't be comfortable I mean, he's gotta be comfortable.

Now she's the type that's compared to a rose that grew from the concrete,
So sweet ya know,
From the streets yo.
Now she's the opposite of he,
Have you ever seen a lion sleep on the bosom of a sheep?
It's beautiful.
Yeah thug though.

[Chorus]
She's so beautiful and he's a thug,
They're so different yet they're in love.
He's so thugged out and she's so beautiful,
They're so perfect cause they're in love.

Picture this, his warm velvet voice on a cold winters night,
Sugar free, bitter truth.
Building life from a slang so divine.
Soul to soul, their flesh pressed,
From a firm of onyx tenderness.
He signed his name with a venom kiss,
Upon a heart, I never heard of such bliss.

Now she's the opposite of he,
Such as a butterfly and he's a killer bee.
Yeah, she becomes a victim to his sting,
And he's amazed by the colors of her wings.
And the life he's led has left him with some scars,
But, she viewed them all as mid-beauty marks.
The moral of the story, plain as can be,
He loved her cause, He is me.

[Chorus: x2]

Da Da-da-da da da da-da-da da

She's beautiful and he's a thug,
Made for each other 'cause they're in love.
She's a petal and he's a thorn,
From a different type of story since they were born.

Jaheim,"Mmmmh diamond
Ohh diamond (diamond)

Diamond in da ruff
someone that you don't meet twice

We left the Brickz for the 'Burbs
turned Mo into Remy
matching fur coats and Fendi
from the bus to a Bentley coupe
with a closet full of shoes yeah

Than our smiles turned to frowns
ups turned to downs
I don't know where i'm going now
I think about her every once in awhile

We started out like Bobby and Whitney
Justin and Britney
Then it all got ugly
if it weren't for the money
you said i start actin' funny
but what's wrong witcha honey

then the good turned to bad
forgot what we had
is it to late to get it back?
I think about her
more than once in awhile

Like when i spot a rainbow
or see a fallin' star
a set of twins, or a classic car
a four leaf clover, or a two dollar bill
it's so rare that it's so unreal

And I don't know how to get over her smile
I wonder what she's doin (what's goin on)?
I think about her every once in awhile (once in awhile)

I should've came with a ring
set a date for next May
guess i thought that you'd wait
now I hate that I took so long
played around wit' her now she's gone

now my smiles turned to frowns, ups turned to downs
and i don't know where i'm goin (now now now now)
I think about her every once in awhile

We argued like Archie and Edith
like Ike turned on Tina
but I really didn't mean it
I was raised not to hit a woman
especially not the one i'm lovin'

but when the good turned to bad
happy to sad
I wish we could take it back/(How I miss you baby
I think about her every once in awhile

Like when I spot a rainbow
or see a fallin star
a set of twins, or a classic car
a four leaf clover or a two dollar bill
it's so rare that it's so unreal

I don't know how
to get over her smile
I wonder what she's doin now
I think about her every once in awhile

Your like a star
shinning in the broad daylight
Something you don't see all the time
and now I finally recognize
that I shoulda made you all mine
never shoulda let you pass me by
you put that sparkle in my life
someone that you don't meet twice
i'm gonna live to regret it baby
ooooh
baby, baby
I miss you...need you...yeahhh

How I wish I could bring you home flowers on tombstones

Think how I'm receiving blessings Finally got the platinum record
Did you see me on soul train dedicated the whole thing
To your memory just hoping you're out there and knowing

Now he hard, he buff,  he tough, doo rag and Timbs
Kinda hard to get a job back out on the block
Charge that to the game

Had it bad, no dad, she don't know who to trust
Every man she ever loved only want to crush
Charge that to the game
But it's all gravy, hey baby
Shots get popped, the cops shut down the party
Jeans sag low, blow smoke out of Dutches
We've got love for y'all but y'all don't love us
So we swerve in the Suburban switchin' lanes
Spend up all our dough on them chrome and thangs
Name our kids some funny names
Don't hate on us, we're fabulous
Prepaid cellies for local calls
Lil' don and divas up at the mall
Rockin' cornrow twist, that's how we roll
But don't hate on us, we're fabulous

They met, he said how she was a dime
So naive that she believed every single line
17, first time slipped up, 'bout to have a child
Charge that to the game
Was just us and mom, single family home
She did the best she could, did it all her own
Met a man but he won't raise a child that's not his own
Oh, no, oh, no, no
But it's all gravy, hey baby

Still I'd be chasin' skirts then {I could remember}
And if it wasn't for that fight last night
You smashin out my headlights then {I could remember}

If it wasn't for parole
Steady duckin' my P O girl you know {I could remember}
But silly me, silly me, babe

Spend my life makin' love to you 
Oh, girl
Oh, I forgot to be your lover

Findin' numbers in her purse (I'm tellin' you, brother)
Better put that woman first (You better put your woman first)

And you know she ain't wearin' her ring (Oh, yeah)

second
{Came down to love} You know I had to win the last race
{Spend some time} Put in some work
{And for better or worse} Always put that woman first

When she starts bringin' up old dirt
And the fights keep getting worse (Gettin' worse)
Findin' numbers in her purse (In her purse)
Better put that woman first (Put that woman first)

And you know she ain't wearin' her ring (Ooh, yeah)
When she starts playin' little games (Her little games)
Comin' in late from work (I'mma say it again)
You better put that woman first (Put that woman, put that woman first)

When she starts bringin' up old dirt
And the fights keep getting worse (She's gonna leave you)
Findin' numbers in her purse
Better put that woman first (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

When she starts playin' little games (Yeah, yeah)

You been looking real good lately
Makin' me feen I know we're friends but listen up
You can't be coming around me in tight jeans
Makin' me weak I think you really trust me too much

You and me been cool
Since back in middle school
Like when we used to clown
And run around
And act a fool

Now that were older I been noticing you bustin out those jeans
Never seen that coming up think you know what I mean
When other niggaz tried to holla had to let em know
Told em none of ya'll ain't good enough the truth be told

'Cause when I first figure out what love was
I was a young blood
And you've always been that treasure
We've always been together

Your not that little girl I once knew anymore
I will see you fitting your clothes so well I can tell
Your not that girl from junior high school that's for sure
Your changing the rules now that your fine as hell

[Chorus]

Now there you go again on my lap
Thinking that I'm in control and I won't react
When your form is grown so phat
Bout time you know for all that its worth

Your killing me softly in those product tops and mini skirts
Hots just puttin' work all up in my face girl what did you think
That I'd stop being a man when you came on the block
Showin' your promises

On the back of that bike
Showin' just what I like
And a woman if you get it you had it comin' girl

Your not that little girl I once knew anymore
I will see you fitting your clothes so well I can tell

Oh, yeah
Oh, ooh, ooh,
Well, oh shorty
Baby, listen girl
Oh (Excuse me)

She was standing on 125th
Waiting on the 6, one hand on her hip
Puffing a spliff, post up on the block
Like the baddest chick
So I asked her one question like
Wait a minute, who you wit?
I'm in a fayest whip, rims spinning and shit
I pulled over on the curb, had to represent
Hey girl, it's not safe out here walking alone
Hop your pretty a** in, I'll take you home

Shorty what's your name
I'm in love with your stance
You got me wide open, I'm feeling your game
I know that other cats might tell you the same
I'm not your average guy, girl I'm far from a lame
Let's hit the LQ, cop whatever you drink
And we can get open right in back of the Range
Or hit the hotel, turn out the penthouse suite
It won't be the last time I promise I'ma holla again

She got a** like whoa
Couldn't keep that on the low
The girl was straight blazing from head to toe
(Ja you gotta be careful she might be under age)
Girl lets see some ID, no you won't get me
As a fact on that, I'm about to fall back
I can easily replace you
I'm not trying to get locked up
She said she's riding shot gun, her license says 20+
Bring your pretty a** on girl, let's get it on

Shorty what's your name

Take off all your clothes
Tell me what you waiting for
Let me rub your back and your stomach too
Stretch your toes, turn around love I got you

Damn good in bed

Would you mind if I want to squeeze you, tease you
I just want to please you

I choose you baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I choose you baby
Yea

[Verse 1]
I can push that whip off a showcase floor
Put TV screens in the headrest door
Something a little more mature
Preparing for the future
Put the down on something
With a fence, a roof, and a door
Or the jewelry store
A pinky ring or ring for her(and)
Cherish her forever more
What could be better
Something for myself
Or for my baby

All the places I can be
And people I can see
Or the only one for me
The decision was easy to make
I choose you over everything

And I just wanna love my baby
I thank the heavens for the gift he gave me
Oh and I just wanna say
Oh Oh Oh just wanna love ya
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do for you
Change my life so I could live it for you

[Verse 2]
Camouflage get from the corner stores
Holding the dice tryna get a little more
Or something more secure
In the house cuddled up on the couch
With the woman adore
Or in the streets steady breaking the law
Or creeping with my ex trying not to get caught
Or wifing you
Ready yo die for you
Oh yea that's all I wanna do

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Out of all the things that I been through
I'd rather be kicking it with my boo
When the pillows not enough
And there's no one to cuff
I hit her up and she comes through
Can't no other chick compare to her
She can pull it off rocking Timbs and a fur
She my class ghetto girl
And I wouldn't give her up for the world

Jaheim,"Who
Who did the daddy thing
When a father wasn't there
Who did the daddy thing

Now usually
If there's a car seat
Up in the back seat
Or a tiny shoe swinging from the rear view mirror
A ring on her hand
I could never be her man
But we got so close
Blew all my dough in the Baby Gap school clothes
Pretty little angel in berets and bows
And a button nose
After a while started calling me daddy

I should've known that it couldn't last
Should've known that you'd take him right back
I should've took off running
When I first saw her coming
Would have never gotten so attached

When her father wasn't there to participate
He got hit with a bid upstate
When she needed diapers, wipes, food, and baby shoes
Won't you tell me
Who did the daddy thing?
I gave her everything
Who did the daddy thing?
Nobody nobody but me

Now normally
I would just hit and run
But can't you see
I'm about you and your little one
I took the jokes from all of my folks
How I got caught up playing step daddy
I got my income tax
And said fuck it
And traded in your bucket
Cause that coupe wasn't big enough
I wasn't trying to replace him
Now that he's back around
Guess you don't need me now
You don't need me anymore

I should've known that it could'nt last
Should've known that you'd take him right back
I should've took off running
When I first saw her coming
Would have never gotten so attached

When her father wasn't there to participate
He got hit with a bid upstate
When she needed diapers,wipes,food,and baby shoes
Won't you tell me
Who did the daddy thing?
I gave her everything
Who did the daddy thing?
Nobody but me

On her first day of school
Holidays from the very first steps she made
When she needed love, trust, patience and truth
I want you to tell me
Who did the daddy thing?
I gave her everything
Who did the daddy thing?
Nobody but me

Longs walks with
Piggy backs and
Baby cribs and light blue Timbs
I did it all out of love(all in the name of love)
Every Christmas
Xbox's little dresses
Tennis braclets
I did all
All just because
When there was no one(no one)
When nobody else was there for her

When her father wasn't there to participate
He got hit with a bid upstate
When she needed diapers, wipes, food, and baby shoes
Won't you tell me
Who did the daddy thing?
And you know I was the man
Who did the daddy thing?
A shoulder to cry on
Someone to talk to
On her first day of school
Holidays from the very first steps she made
When she needed love, trust, patience, and truth
I won't you to tell me

Jaheim,"Oh Ah ha!

Yo things was all fine when the sun was shining
But when the rain came that's when the pain came
Sittin' up in the Range
She feels some kinda way
She doing strange things
But I ain't with the games
Just keep it a secret yo
It's cheaper to keep her bro
Two wrongs don't make us right
But we equal though
It's getting better though
And I can't sweat her
And I love her
But I can't let her know
I can't let her go

Have you ever been in love?
Well well well
Have you ever been in love?
Well well well

She was 5 foot 4 from the floor
Prettiest little thing I've seen before
Her body was so tight, had her hair done right
But who's shorty with tonight
I got that big boy sitting outside
All I need to know if she'd mind if I took her for a ride
I couldn't wait to meet her
On that first date to treat her
I just wanna please her

So we jumped up in the Range (jumped up in the Range)
Shorty started acting strange (so strange)
Her attitude began to change
As it began to rain (began to rain)
Shorty started to complain (oh yeah)
About every single thing

[Chorus]
Every time I think about her
I can't make up my mind 
Well it's hard to explain
Just the way I feel about her
Well I'll tell you what I know
Brown sugar love me real slow
And I don't care what my friends say
I just can't let her go

Two years gone by, I
Trying to find the reasons why, I
I always seem to make you cry, I
Just don't know why
Well could it be
You always running in the streets
Come home from work, ain't nothing to eat
You stretched your little dough running home for more
Then you're straight back out the door
Somebody tell me, baby

Even though we fuss and fight
Cussing all through the night
She's in my arms all the morning light
We wake up and make up
Even though she gets on my nerves
She take shit that she don't deserve
Tell me what's a woman like that worth

[Chorus]

Now I finally realized
You're like heaven in my eyes
I took a long time, I apologize
Even though at times you messed up
Shaking your ass up in the club, that's messed up
But you're quick to hit the block when the crib get hot
When my dough get low, you be holding me up
But I'm still out here chasing
Out here baby making
What a brother gotta do

Money is nothing
Whatever Kiss wants is gon' get purchased
House so high in the Hills, phones don't get service
Just listen, even though we be riffing
Without you around, I think things would be different
And not for the better neither
My friends tell me I better leave ya
I tell them to get some better cheaper
Yeah we gon' make it pop ma
But you shaking your ass in the club gotta stop ma
Get my â??Nac, get my Dutch
When I'm falling I need you to be my crutch
And we can just take it from there
Now see if the love can overpower all the hate in the air

One thing she should know
I don't ever want to let her go
But if she keeps on with the movements
She gon' make me lose it
And I hope that she can see
That I'm down for her, but is she down for me
Whenever in need
I make sure she eats
She can always count on me (yeah)

Have you ever been in love?
Well well well

Every time I think ""hey, have you ever been in love?""",Everytime I Think About Her

The seal of Sin
Upon your chest, protect you

In the sky the morning star soars
Way up high remind us all
The years to come all love will die

Before the sun, a star sends its light
Set your ritual, right
Streams of torment
Streams of blood
Fear for your doul, your spirit

Remember me gaze at the sun
Light your fire let them remember
Forgetful they are
Still they are gods

In the sky
Way up high where I roam
All love will die

Let the ghosts gather
Wandering endlessly
All of them old and new
Let them all gather

Jaheim,"She's more than a dime, she's a dub
Damn I'm in love
Hit it from the house to the club
Keep my mind on her 
Spend my last dime on her
She bring me to cloud nine when my ass climb on her
Can see she make the picture clear
Just like Time Warner
Treat her like the car
The way that I ride on her
She helped me focus in 
Get my rhymes right too
And my mind right too
That's why she shine through

I gotta quit
I gotta get this chick up out my system
She's no good for me
All of my dogs wanna hit her
Right after I'm with her
I eat then I fall asleep
And it's gettin' costly 
Lately all I've been banging is the chicks that come to see
But shorty she's a dime
In fact that girl's a dub
And I think I'm falling in love
She gets me all chocked up
I can barely catch my breath
Don't want to pass her around
I keep her to myself
You see she's gives me stimulation
And nobody's messing up our rotation
Although I think it's big
And you better believe 
Nobody's blazing it up but me

I need her first thing when I wake up
Call me a fiend
And I ain't talking about nicotine
Y'all know what I mean
Just call me a fiend
I'm just a addict for your love, I've got to have it all your love
I can't let it go
I'll never be clean
You can just call me a fiend

I twist her up, pull her to me real slow (so slow)
Let the taste of a chocolate make my eyes get low
But she burns through my paper so fast
Gotta make it last
Hate to watch them Swisha sweets walk past
When my personal stash get low
Then it's back to the block tryna find her
Surely she's a dime
In fact that girls a dub
And I think I've fallin' in love
She gets me all chocked up
I can barely catch my breath
Don't want to pass her around
I keep her to myself
You see she's gives me stimulation
And nobody's messing up our rotation
Although I think it's big

Nobody's blazing it up but me

I need a first thing when I wake up

Y'all know what I mean
I'm just a addict for your love, I've got to have it all your love
I can't let it go
I'll never be clean
You can just call me a fiend

I'm a fiend for her
Go to sleep wit a dream of her
Wake up, grind hard, get cream for her
Play the whip on a lean wit her
Just in case I don't make it home
I'ma leave a team with her
Me and her been down since her head was round
I went to every party in town and bought her a round
And now she get lose with it 
Her heads purple and green but she looks cute with it
And I ain't mad at her
I let the team take a stab at her
I bring her home all alone and then pack her bags for her
We can do it all night, right?
Wake up and do it all day 
All we needs a light bright

Letting her go
Is gunna be a slow process
One kiss from her lips took the stress up off my chest
Riding shot gun, body tight, couldn't hold it in
Had to park and spark it up again
And I swear she left her heaven scent in the air
All in my clothes, all in my hair 
(She has my head in her )
Y'all know what I'm talking about 

I need her first thing when I wake up
Call me a fiend
And I ain't talking about nicotine
Y'all know what I mean
I'm just a addict for your love, I've got to have it all your love
I can't let it go
I'll never be clean
You can just call me a fiend
I need her first thing when I wake up
Call me a fiend
And I ain't talking about nicotine

Jaheim,"I done stood out on the block
12 O'clock still phishing
I done broke up bricks with baking soda in the kitchen
I done lost my religion
Done spent my tuition
I couldn't fill up the hole in my soul,
There's something missing
I done sat back and laughed and
Let the beats unfold
Done scores of triggers
Robbed niggas and stores
Five years parole
Kid I've been locked up
I done lost so much my heart is boxed up

I thought I'd never see the blue sky
Never see the birds fly
Until I met you sunshine
I never knew the other side
Never knew what love was like
I thought I'd never see a pot of gold
But baby you're the rainbow
Take me where I never been
I thought the pain would never end
But now, now that I've found my girl
I ain't never, ever, ever gonna let her go, no
And now, now she's inside of my world
I ain't never, ever, ever gonna let her go, no

I done drowned my sorrows in a bottle of gin
I done poured out liquor for my very best friend
I been rich, fell off and got dough again
Been left out in the cold, told I could never win
I done promised to my lady I would try to change
Met a chick went back in to the same damn thing
I done took the blame and blamed people for things
Snatching change on the train, I've done some things

I thought I'd never see the blue sky
Never see the birds fly
Until I met you sunshine
Never knew the other side
I never knew what love was like
I thought I'd never see a pot of gold
But baby you're the rainbow
Take me where I never been
I thought the pain would never end
But now, now that I've found my girl
I ain't never, ever, ever gonna let her go, no
And now, now she's inside of my world
I ain't never, ever, ever gonna let her go, no

Every day seemed gray
Until you came and you brought the sun my way
Til Heaven or earth sent her my way I longed for the day
Somebody would say, ""I love you baby"" and
If it weren't for you there ain't no person I'd be trusting
In the sound of my voice
Oh for better or worse, richer or poor
I've been through so much
Til you'll be my girl forever, now

Now, now that I've found my girl
I ain't never, ever, ever gonna let her go, no
And now, now she's inside of my world
I ain't never, ever, ever gonna let her go, no

I will never let you go",I Ain't Never
Jaheim,"Yea my baby
Well
It's crazy
How you played me
Oh yea
How you played me
How you played me
Why why'd you do it baby

When I was hitting
I was in rotation off the charts (charts)
Like number 2 with a bullet
I was shooting straight for your heart (yea yea)
But it looks like I'm slippin
From that peak position
Drop down on your list
From top 10
To not even being on your countdown

And so I wait (I wait)
For you to come digging in the crates(oh yea)
Blow off the dust
So I could finally get some attention (oh)
Cause once you put the nigga on wax (yea)
You can't just put me back (you can't just put me back)
Just cut it up and scratch it
And get back
Cause your only gonna play me again

[Chorus]
You fade me out
And you blend him in
I can't get no spin unless I'm requested
She's something like a DJ
We used to move the crowd
Now the groove is all worn out
I can't get no play
She's something like a DJ

I'm so in love with the way you work the one and two's (one and two's)
But I can't help but be jealous
The way your work them other dudes
You get caught up skipping
Girl just let me flip it (just let me flip it)
I'll show you the remix baby
Breaking records at the top
For the number one spot

So I wait(I wait)
For you to come digging in the crates (in the crates)
Blow off the dust
So I could finally get some attention
Cause once you put the nigga on wax (yea)

Just cut it up and scratch it
And get back
Cause your only gonna play me again

Baby girl let's slow it down
Like it's the last song of the night (last song of the night)
We'll be dancing till the lights come on
No need to switch it up
Until you know the time is right (time is right)
See you got me feeling like
I'm your favorite song

My heart is turning
And I'm yearning for your love",Like a DJ
Jaheim,"When she walked pass the corner store
I said Hello, what's your name
She said Tracy Donatello
Long hair, tight jeans and stilettos
Conversation so good, didn't want to let go
Shorty you're a perfect 10
Classical like violins
I just can't settle for a friend
I need to know you more

You're a masterpiece
From your head to your feet
Well educated plus you're so complete
Them other girls be hating
Cause you're so unique
I love you cause you're from the streets
How can I be down with you
Shoot a couple of rounds with you
Drop the math and I'll blow through
And love we can do what you want to do

I know I saw that a** before
Bouncing up my block, I saw you twice
Shopping in the mall
Still looking sweet and tender
You've got that smile that I'll always remember
I only want to get together
Love I'm trying to know you better
We can make it last forever
I can't get you out of my mind

And love we can do what you want to do

Tell me why you trying to play a nigga out
Love stop fronting can a brother take you out
Somewhere, I got a lot of quality time to share
Girl just say the word and I'm there
All I want to do is, maybe hit the clubs
And have a few drinks
Grab a bite to eat and head to the crib
So I can do my thing,
Gonna have you up under my wing baby

You're a masterpiece

Jaheim,"Ooh Ah ha!

Yo things was all fine when the sun was shining
But when the rain came that's when the pain came
Sittin' up in the Range
She feels some kinda way
She doing strange things
But I ain't with the games
Just keep it a secret yo
It's cheaper to keep her bro
Two wrongs don't make us right
But we equal though
It's getting better though
And I can't sweat her
And I love her
But I can't let her know
I can't let her go

Have you ever been in love?
Well well well

Have you ever been in love?
Well well well

She was 5 foot 4 from the floor
Prettiest little thing I've seen before
Her body was so tight, had her hair done right
But who's shorty with tonight
I got that big boy sitting outside
All I need to know if she'd mind if I took her for a ride
I couldn't wait to meet her
On that first date to treat her
I just wanna please her

So we jumped up in the Range (jumped up in the Range)
Shorty started acting strange (so strange)
Her attitude began to change
As it began to rain (began to rain)
Shorty started to complain (oh yeah)
About every single thing

[Chorus]
Every time I think about her
I can't make up my mind 
Well it's hard to explain
Just the way I feel about her
Well I'll tell you what I know
Brown sugar love me real slow
And I don't care what my friends say
I just can't let her go

Two years gone by, I
Trying to find the reasons why, I
I always seem to make you cry, I
Just don't know why
Well could it be
You always running in the streets
Come home from work, ain't nothing to eat
You stretched your little dough running home for more
Then you're straight back out the door
Somebody tell me, baby

Even though we fuss and fight
Cussing all through the night
She's in my arms all the morning light
We wake up and make up
Even though she gets on my nerves
She take shit that she don't deserve
Tell me what's a woman like that worth

[Chorus]

Now I finally realized
You're like heaven in my eyes
I took a long time, I apologize
Even though at times you messed up
Shaking your ass up in the club, that's messed up
But you're quick to hit the block when the crib get hot
When my dough get low, you be holding me up
But I'm still out here chasing
Out here baby making
What a brother gotta do

Money is nothing
Whatever Kiss wants is gon' get purchased
House so high in the Hills, phones don't get service
Just listen, even though we be riffing
Without you around, I think things would be different
And not for the better neither
My friends tell me I better leave ya
I tell them to get some better cheaper
Yeah we gon' make it pop ma
But you shaking your ass in the club gotta stop ma
Get my 'Nac, get my Dutch
When I'm falling I need you to be my crutch
And we can just take it from there
Now see if the love can overpower all the hate in the air

One thing she should know
I don't ever want to let her go
But if she keeps on with the movements
She gon' make me lose it
And I hope that she can see
That I'm down for her, but is she down for me
Whenever in need
I make sure she eats
She can always count on me (yeah)

Have you ever been in love?
Well well well

Every time I think ""hey, have you ever been in love?""",Everytime I Think About Her[ Bonus Track for
Jaheim,"She's more than a dime, she's a dove
Damn, I'm in love, hit it from the house to the club
Keep my mind on her, spend my last dime on her
She bring me to cloud 9 when my ass climb on her

Can see she make the picture clear just like Time Warner
Treat her like the car, the way that I ride on her
She helped me focus in get my rhymes right too
And my mind right too, that's why she shine through

I gotta quit, I gotta get this chick up out my system
She's no good for me
All of my dogs wanna hit her, right after I'm with her
I eat then I fall asleep and it's gettin' costly

Lately, all I've been banging is
Them chicks that come with seeds
But shorty she's a dime, in fact that girl's a dove
And I think I'm falling in love

She gets me all choked up
I can barely catch my breath
Don't want to pass her around
I keep her to myself

You see she gives me stimulation
Ain't nobody messing up our rotation
Although I think it's big and you better believe
Nobody blazing it up but me

I need her first thing when I wake up
Call me a fiend
And I ain't talking about nicotine
Y'all know what I mean
Just call me your fiend

I'm just a addict for your love
I've got to have it all your love
I can't let it go, I'll never be clean
You can just call me a fiend

I twist her up, pull her to me real slow
Let the taste of a chocolate make my eyes get low
But she burns through my paper so fast, gotta make it last
Hate to watch them swisha sweets walk past

When my personal stash get low
Then it's back to the block tryin' find her
Shorty she's a dime in fact that girl's a dove
And I think I'm fallin' in love

She gets me all choked up
I can barely catch my breath
Don't want to pass her around
I keep her to myself

You see she gives me stimulation
Ain't nobody messing up our rotation
Although I think it's big and you better believe
Nobody blazing it up but me

I need her first thing when I wake up
Call me a fiend
And I'm not talking nicotine
Y'all know what I mean?

I'm just an addict for your love
I've got to have it, all your love
I can't let it go, I'll never be clean
You can just call me a fiend

I need her first thing when I wake up
Call me a fiend
And I ain't talking about nicotine
Y'all know what I mean?

I'm just an addict for your love
I've got to have it, all your love
I can't let it go, I'll never be clean
You can just call me a fiend

I'm a fiend for her, go to sleep wit a dream of her
Wake up, grind hard, get cream for her
Play the whip on a lean wit her
Just in case I don't make it home
I'ma leave a team with her

Me and her been down since her head was 'round
I went to every party in town and bought her around
And now she get lose with it
Her head's purple and green but she looks cute with it

And I ain't mad at her, I let the team take a stab at her
I bring her home all alone and unpack her bags for her
We can do it all night, right, wake up and do it all day
All we need's a light, right

Letting her go is gonna be a slow process
One kiss from her lips took the stress up off my chest
Riding shot gun, body tight, couldn't hold it in
Had to park and spark it up again

And I swear she left her heaven scent in the air
All in my clothes, all in my hair
She got my head in a cloud
Y'all know what I'm talking about

I need her first thing when I wake up
Call me a fiend
And I ain't talking about nicotine
Y'all know what I mean

I'm just an addict for your love
I've got to have it all your love
I can't let it go, I'll never be clean
You can just call me a fiend

I need her first thing when I wake up
Call me a fiend
And I ain't talking about nicotine

[Verse 1]
Good man, good woman
Hooked up and they had a couple of children
Four kids, look what the lord did
Smilin' on my parents with a blessing

And even though their days wouldn't be long
Momma looked around and daddy's gone
But we weren't alone
Until the lord called her home

She's in a place with my little sister
From time to time man I really miss her
And as for my dad, from what I understand
He was a strong man
And I know they're back together

[Chorus]
Poppa went first, and momma went last
But I ain't mad, cause I know that
They're back together again, up in heaven
When the sun shines down
There's a smile on my face
There ain't no doubt when I think about
Where they went
And they're back together, together again

[Verse 2]
I wish I could tell em
All of the things I never got to tell him
But I'm sure he knows
Made sure my mama told him so
And even when I start stressin'
I think of what a good time they're havin'

And the bottom line is
Man I know this

She's gone upstairs with my little sister
And I can clearly see the picture
Julie and my dad
How can I be mad
When the lord has brought them together

[Chorus]
See poppa went first, and momma went last
And I ain't mad, cause I know that
They're back together again, up in heaven
As the sun shines down
There's a smile on my face
There's no doubt, there's no doubt when I think about
Where they went
Cause they're back together again

[Bridge]
Even though that my parents just wasn't in the plans
See, when I was a young man I didn't understand
Now I'm all grown up, and I'm missing your touch
The portrait in the frame, it's just not enough
All the dreams I've been chasin' after everyday
The memories just won't seem to fade away
There's only one thing, I'll tell you something
I know that they're dancing up in heaven through the lord's grace

[Chorus]
Cause poppa went first, and momma went last
And I said I ain't mad cause I know where they went
Up in heaven, upon high
When the sun shines down, and the rain starts to pour
I know... Sister I know
You're dancing in the sky
Said I wrote this song about it, and I'm real real proud about it
I know you're dancing in the sky

Jaheim,"Have you ever?
Come on

Have you ever
Think about it

[Chorus]
Have you ever
Thought of what you did
When you were a kid
As you reminisce

Have you ever
Thought about your life
Thought you paid a price
Cuz It wasn't right
Have you ever

Ever tell the truth but lied
Held back when you shoulda cried
Didn't say it when you shoulda said goodbye
Meant something but didn't say
Said something but didn't mean
Seems like we all been through it

Ever let the people get away
Ever look back
And wish you could get back
How it was back in the day
Ever had a girl
You wouldn't budge
Instead of telling them how much
You'd be true with loving

Have you ever ever
Or am I the only one
Tell me have you ever
Looked back on the things that you've done

Been up in the club
Bustin' over
One too many
Double shots of henney
Told you she was twenty-one
You think maybe
You and her leaving
End up in a hotel suite bed
Whoa! no glove
Slipped up now you gettin that love
Next morning you wake up
Feeling stupid..

Have you ever been
Caught up in a jam
You and your man
Not thinking
Make a quick decision
Got the Ooh Wee In your hand
Busted you be doing 20 plus fo' sure
Drop it and run then the whole hood'll know

Given that behind the three
Hit's glass

Cuddle up, satellite service
Ohh baby whatever, let me accommodate ya

Jaheim,"[Chorus]
I live the life of a thug
Sold many of drugs
Whatever you name it, I've done
Laid a few cats down
I'm on some new shit now
I tell you whatever you name it, I've done
Live the life of a hustla
Keepin' it gangsta
Whatever you name it, I've done
I been all around the world
Met all kinds of girls
I tell you whatever you name it, I've done

[Verse 1]
Coming up I had it bad
I never knew my dad
Only memories, a picture in a frame
He passed away when I was two
There was nothing they could do
And all I know is that they said he was the ladies man
Momma kept pressing on
Her boys kept her strong
We didn't need for much
She did it all alone
She kept her head up high
Till the day she died
Told me to never give up
Do what I gotta, to survive

I been uptown, played many games, hurt by many girls
Been all around, looking for love, but no one to trust
I been locked down with the big boys
See I changed now
The high school diploma made my momma proud

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
In and out of jail since 12
A juvenile so no bail
Most of my summer days, spent em' away
They gave me a B and E, first degree robbery, criminal mischief
Prosecution's on my heels now
I tried to straighting up too
I got hit by deja vu
A 9 to 5 couldn't find it
My only option was to block it
I been shot at, stabbed
You don't know the half
I was a real ass cat
Taking a look back
The life of a thug

I been uptown, played many games, hurt by many girls
Been all around, looking for love, but no one to trust
I been locked down with the big boys
See I changed now
The high school diploma made my momma proud

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I been through so much
Didn't know who to trust
I could only count on me
Out in playing in these streets
Had to change up my hustle
Had to live with the struggle
Taking a dozen a blow
It's been a long time coming but I came up
And I gotta thank the Lord
Cause he gave me enough
Anything more than that I wouldn't be where I'm at
Anything less I confess
Look at me now
I'm at my best

[Chorus]",Life of a Thug
Jaheim,"[Verse 1]
If you didn't ask then he wouldn't tell
But the truth is you going through hell
But you hide it so well
You tug on his sleeve
You beg and you plead
Anything so that he won't leave
He would be like oh well (oh well)
And half of the time you knew he was lying
Said he was on his rizzily grind
He's providing so well

[Hook]
And now he's out there running game on you
I'll be there at the drop of a dime
And when he thinks your at home with the kids on the couch watching t.v. all the time

[Chorus]
If you think you're lonely now (oh baby I'm on my way)
Wait until tonight girl
Cause I'm coming to scoop you up
You got the kinda love
Never get enough of messing bed spreads up
It's all up to you
Wait until tonight girl
If you think you're lonely now (oh baby I'm on my way)
Wait until tonight girl
And you can be back before he even knows your gone
Take you to the peak of ecstasy... come on
It's all up to you
Wait until tonight girl
Oh baby I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
During love makin' we lose control of ourselves
Digging in my back with your nails
But you do it so well
And we both fall asleep then your Sidekick beeps
Angry messages he left on your cell
You know he's gonna yell... oh well
Do you think he suspects us
Picked up on the trail
Thinks it's time you sit him down and tell
Cause he knows you so well

[Hook]

[Chorus]

For every broken date you promised
For all the lies that you coulda been honest
And for your Sandra she found a Robert
I'll get right there
If you think she's lonely now

For every little dream you sold her
For the night you wasn't at home to hold her
After the drama, here comes the Karma
If you think she's lonely know

[Chorus]",Lonely
Jaheim,"Yeah, yeah, ah yeah

Let's get away for your birthday
Take a nice little trip somewhere cross the bay

Hit the mall
Go get your tips did up

And I won't be late
The 55 will be parked at the gate baby

She don't make me feel like you
She don't hold me down like you
On the real she ain't you, you, you, you, you, you, you
She can't wear the crown like you
She can't put it down like you
On the real she ain't you, you, you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 1]
I like her, but I love you
She's fly, but she can't fly over you
Your love is like a brand new Bentley Coupe
Her love is like a Benz that's been used
And you just can't compare the two
The road to happiness leads back to you
Now since we been apart I done tried a few
Nobody's coming close to you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
These other girls just can't fill your shoes
They can't walk in your Gucci boots
If I let you move on to someone new
I would feel like such a fool
That would be crazy, cause baby you're a winner
And every time I'm with her I be thinking 'bout you boo...
And how she don't compare to you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So listen up Shorty
Girl be down for me
Oh Baby, my baby
I was just passing time
Trying to get you off of my mind
Baby
Now how can I prove myself
I really don't need nobody else
You're the one that I love
My angel from up above
First time I laid my eyes on you I knew you were the one
... and baby girl you're second to none
She's aight, but she's not my type
Girl it's true I wanna give you my life
And I hope one day you let me make you my wife baby

Is the true voice of r&b
So I gave ya'll the chance to lead
Now that I'm back relax and breathe

Now guess who's back
That nigga with them platinum plaques
How you gon' deal with that
Tell me how you niggas wanna act
New deal, few mil, nigga check my stats
And I'm still on the block
Hustlin' just don't stop
How you think I iced the watch
And I still got whips to cop
Clowns gon' mess around
Have to lay em' down

Yea, I wish a nigga would over react
Still gutta like a mother
Don't make me black
You don't want none of that
I represent this r&b... ya'll know this
How can you compete... I'm focused
And I'm thinking you should pack it up
Cause Jah got what they want (believe me)

What the game really need

So I gave ya'll the chance to lead
Now that I'm back relax and breathe

I been sittin' back in the cut patiently waiting
Watching you close, learning from your mistakes and
They gased you up, now you sitting on E
I'm the new voice of r&b
I'm sick of this
And I just can't get with it
Hope you stacked up your chips
Now won't you sit back and breathe

Jaheim,"[Verse 1]
She was just an ex of a nigga
Who kept her from her fullest potential
Always played games with her mental
And every type of shit to make her self esteem little
But now her days are always so fly
She's a diamond on the rough no lie
I'm rough enough to make the diamond shine
Just like a trophy ima hold her high
And now I know, oh I know

[Chorus]
And she's good to me, great to me
She crowned me to be the King
Now what you think of that?
Cause she's down for me, my homie, my tangeroni only
Now what you think of that?
Cause she stay real with me, deal with me, perfect to be my wife
Now what you think of that?
She's beautiful to me and I don?t care what you think of that
Now, what you think of that?

[Verse 2]
Hey
She always keep it at a hundred
Never caught fake, phony, or frontin'
Always show me love when I want it
And never lose her cool over nothing
I admit she a gift no lie
The type of girl that you?d be dumb to pass by
She's a blessin' when she came in my life
And I'm so happy that she's mine, oh mine
I know, Oh I know!

Through the struggling and taking it inside
I know that it's hard cause I seen the pain
Through the tears on my momma's eyes
Tryin' your best to be strong
When your past did you wrong
I got your back girl things will be fine
And I gotta give you credit, don?t sweat it
Its gonna get better, forever you?ll have my love

[Chorus]",What You Think of That
Jaheim,"Yeah, oh, no

I used to be the kind of brother
They thought I would never slow down
I used to swear that I don't even care
What happens but baby right now

I see that, you changed my mind
I mean that and it took some time
But now I understand
I can be a better man

I never had a chance to meet
A lover quite like you
You revealed another part of me
Girl you love is trivin' true

Never, will I break your heart
Never, will we ever part
Never, can't believe I used to say it
I used to say

Never, will I love this way
Never, gave my heart away
Never would this player hang
His jersey up and leave the game

Never would've thought
In a million years
I would be here
That's why I say

Never, would I know the truth
Never, would I know
That you would come into my life
And make everything new oh

Never would've thought I would
Take your hand, girl I swear
I would never, never, never, never
Never say never again, again, again

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby

There ain't no question that I love you
I know we've had our ups and downs
But through the tears I know there is nowhere
I can say I'd rather be now

I see that, your my shining star
I mean that, girl you got my heart
And now I hold you here
'cause you made me a stronger man

I wish that I could place
The whole world in front of you
But a man is just a man
So baby, here's my vow to you, babe

Never, will I break your heart
Never, will we ever part
Never, can't believe I used to say it
I used to say

Never, will I love this way
Never, gave my heart away
Never, would this player hang
His jersey up and leave the game

Never would've thought
In a million years
I would be here
And that's why I say

Never, had I known the truth
Never, when I know
That you would come into my life
And make everything new, oh

Never would've thought
I would take your hand, girl I swear
I would never, never, never
Never, never say never

From the day you came along
I sung a brand new song
'cause I know you made it clear to see
That you're a special part of me

Before I had no clue, I was lost till I found you
Baby and I wanna make your heart understand
I'm proud to be your man and I'm 'bout to stay forever
I can't believe that I use to say

Never, will I love this way
Gave my heart away
Never would this player hang
His jersey up and leave the game

Never, no, no, never
No, no, no, no, no
Never, never

I never would've thought
I would take your hand
I would never, never, never, never, never
Never, never, never, never say never again

Yo things was all fine when the sun was shining
But when the rain came that's when the pain came
Sittin' up in the Range
She feels some kinda way
She doing strange things
But I ain't with the games
Just keep it a secret yo
It's cheaper to keep her bro
Two wrongs don't make us right
But we equal though
It's getting better though
And I can't sweat her
And I love her
But I can't let her know
I can't let her go

Have you ever been in love?
Well well well
Have you ever been in love?
Well well well

She was 5 foot 4 from the floor
Prettiest little thing I've seen before
Her body was so tight, had her hair done right
But who's shorty with tonight
I got that big boy sitting outside
All I need to know if she'd mind if I took her for a ride
I couldn't wait to meet her
On that first date to treat her
I just wanna please her

So we jumped up in the Range (jumped up in the Range)
Shorty started acting strange (so strange)
Her attitude began to change
As it began to rain (began to rain)
Shorty started to complain (oh yeah)
About every single thing

[Chorus]
Every time I think about her
I can't make up my mind 
Well it's hard to explain
Just the way I feel about her
Well I'll tell you what I know
Brown sugar love me real slow
And I don't care what my friends say
I just can't let her go

Two years gone by, I
Trying to find the reasons why, I
I always seem to make you cry, I
Just don't know why
Well could it be
You always running in the streets
Come home from work, ain't nothing to eat
You stretched your little dough running home for more
Then you're straight back out the door
Somebody tell me, baby

Even though we fuss and fight
Cussing all through the night
She's in my arms all the morning light
We wake up and make up
Even though she gets on my nerves
She take shit that she don't deserve
Tell me what's a woman like that worth

[Chorus]

Now I finally realized
You're like heaven in my eyes
I took a long time, I apologize
Even though at times you messed up
Shaking your ass up in the club, that's messed up
But you're quick to hit the block when the crib get hot
When my dough get low, you be holding me up
But I'm still out here chasing
Out here baby making
What a brother gotta do

Money is nothing
Whatever Kiss wants is gon' get purchased
House so high in the Hills, phones don't get service
Just listen, even though we be riffing
Without you around, I think things would be different
And not for the better neither
My friends tell me I better leave ya
I tell them to get some better cheaper
Yeah we gon' make it pop ma
But you shaking your ass in the club gotta stop ma
Get my â??Nac, get my Dutch
When I'm falling I need you to be my crutch
And we can just take it from there
Now see if the love can overpower all the hate in the air

One thing she should know
I don't ever want to let her go
But if she keeps on with the movements
She gon' make me lose it
And I hope that she can see
That I'm down for her, but is she down for me
Whenever in need
I make sure she eats
She can always count on me (yeah)

Have you ever been in love?
Well well well

Every time I think ""hey, have you ever been in love?""",Every Time I Think About Her

Jaheim,"She licked the salt, then licked the lime, 
Taken shots with her, but I'm sippin' mine
And by the time her and her girls take a flick and sit back down
I opened open a tab, keep comin', I ordered

Another Round, round round and the room start spinnin'
Woke up in the Mandarin Inn beds spreads linen
Lips licking an olive on a dirty mar, she said meet me tomorrow
Couple rounds up at the bar, me I'm on that dark
She on that clear, on the rocks, another round over here
And if we keep this up its going down (down)
Take that to the head, go ahead, order another round
Words start to slur, its all over her
And we both on that liquid courage, 
And we about to be on the verge, we order another round
Another round, its going down, its going down
Another round, another round
Its going down, its going down

No photo shop, build soda pop, 
Got the kind of body that can't nobody stop
And by the time she hit her limit, getting timid, slowin down
I popped open up the bottle, empty bottles and order another round

[Chorus]

We both wake up with the worst hang over (hang over)
The partyÃ¢??s over and we're both sober (sober)
And I look over at her, she look's over at me
As far as I remember, I cant remember honestly
But oh

Keep mama and your friends from crossing the line

Jaheim,"Oh yeah

I met this girl named Donna
From B.M Alabama
I really like that smile
Those legs, they went for miles

I asked her what's her name
While sizin' up her frame
Feelin' some type of way about her

She was all up on me, couldn't say no
Got a plane to catch but she won't let me go
I really love my life, but I'm missin' just one thing
That woman by my side, forever and always

Come, a little bit closer
Spread out, like you were a poster
Girl I want to, put it on you

Come, a little bit closer
Spread out, like you were a poster
Girl I want to, put it on you

Ain't nobody here, it's just you and me baby
Ain't nobody here, I say we get a little crazy
Let's take it to the room, so many things I wanna do

Girl your kisses just like caramel
Smooth like ice-cream, straight from ""Carvel""
Can't control my hands (I can't control my hands)
I hope you understand
I want you to

Come, a little bit closer
Spread out, like you were a poster
Girl I want to, put it on you

Come, a little bit closer
Spread out, like you were a poster
Girl I want to, put it on you

Can't nobody tell me, that I don't love this girl
It's drivin' me crazy, I'm tryna offer her the world
And when I think about the past, don't wanna bring it back
Lonely missin' heartache is all I ever had
Come closer, come closer
To me

I want you to

Jaheim,"Lights out,
Sucker punch, syked out.
Caught a love wave,
Rode it then I wiped out.
Two ships just passing in the night now,
Offshore, looking for a light house.
Reveal you said that it was painless,
Down and out drowning in a sea of my anguish
Funny, you always said hope floats.
Comprehended but I can't cope
So I

Gotta find my way back, way back to you baby.
Tryna find my way back , way back to you baby.
Gotta find my way back, way back to you, to us, to love.

Man down, my heart's in your hand now.
Hate to love, draw an X in the sand now.
No clue, no map, damn.
So I'm digging until I end up in Japan now.

Reveal you said that it was painless,
Down and out drowning in a sea of my anguish
Funny, you always said hope floats.
Comprehended but I cant cope
So I

Gotta find my way back, way back to you baby.
Tryna find my way back , way back to you baby.
Gotta find my way back, way back, to you, to us, to love.

We go lost lines got crossed
And the light turned to static baby.
And your ship got caught up the current
And carried both of us away
We were so much better
When we were together
And just cant let you slip away.

Gotta find my way back, way back to you baby.
Tryna find my way back , way back to you baby.
Gotta find my way back, way back, to you, to us, to love.",Finding My Way Back

And here we stand the two of us face to face
Staring at each other

Yeah, yeah, oh

When you're speaking from the heart then you know that it's real
When you're speaking from the heart then you know that it's real

Blame me, I should've left when the door was open
Baby blame me I should've found some words to say
But now there's nothing left to say baby
Blame me, go and put me in the white room
Go and hand me that white coat
Since you're looking at me calling me crazy
Get my mess, cause you're calling me sick baby
Blame me, if I didn't say that I love you enough
Blame me, if I wasn't on time for a timeless love
You say it's me, I say it's you
Now we're taking shots like we're bulletproof
Now it ain't much that I expect from you
So go ahead and do what you wanna do

When you fall out of love you gotta blame someone
Say hello to the bad guy (bad guy)
You try to paint the picture like you're such a victim
Well I guess I'm the bad guy (bad guy)
Hello, hello, say hello

Blame me, cause you're so unhappy now
Blame me, for every time you hit the ground
Tell the truth its gonna be hard getting over this
Doing time like a locked down in prison
Staring at the wall, I know I made some bad decision
Get me out of this hell hole don't wanna be here
Blame me, go ahead and blame me
Because I said you could
Blame me, go ahead and blame me cause I knew you would
You say it's me, I say it's you
Now we're taking shots like we're bulletproof
When you point the finger, three point at you?
Remember that next time you're trying to blame somebody

When you fall out of love you gotta blame someone
Say hello to the bad guy (bad guy)
You try to paint the picture like you're such a victim
Well I guess I'm the bad guy (bad guy)
Hello, hello, say hello

I've been getting bad with some good
It's the misunderstood
You think I'm always up to no good
Making me out the villian, when I'm only chillin'
We're talking stick, stick to the plan
I been good to you girl, put the world in your hand
Didn't appreciate the man you found, well check it out
It's getting hard for me to stick around

When you fall out of love you gotta blame someone

Jaheim,"Now I've got a story that I want to share with you
Of a young man name Tray he was on his way
Till that fatal day, well well well
It was 7:12 PM Travon’s girl call to speak to him, yeah yeah yeah
He was standing outside his daddy's home
He was all alone, on the cellphone
About 7:16 the call goes dead
Travon’s on the struggle now
He was lyin' on the ground
Fighting to save his life, and as the gun went off
He got hit in the chest and the neighbor who shot him confessed
And the saddest part about this he was only 17
He didn't even lived his dream.

Ohh, (no) Florida something's very wrong (aw Yeah)
Need to know, what's going on?
(What's going on?) Can we make this house a home,
Oh (oh) Florida can I talk to you?
Can we walk and have an interview
(Every time I turn around something is going, is going down)Florida this land is overdue

Did I, did I say that he was unarmed
How could a baby cause any harm,
With no weapon insight now you know that ain’t right
All he has was his candy in hand (his skittles) candy
What about the family (his brother)
His father, sister and Manny
It's so hard to let go, what you can't control
May his soul rest in peace
But I hope and pray (I hope, I hope and pray) on judgement day
To have it all your way
And I know, I know, I know it won't bring back your baby
Sebrina and keep your head up lady
Brother Tracy be strong
For Travon,
And the worst part about is
He was only 17, didn’t even live his dream.

Ohh, (ohh) Florida something's very wrong (they didn’t have to take his life)
Need to know, what's going on?(Please tell me)
Can we make this house a home,
Oh (oh) Florida can I talk to you? (Can we march all over this land)
Can we walk and have an interview
Florida this land is overdue

So Florida don't make me cry
For I got leave your way bye bye
White sandy beaches and wind,
Where the sun doesn't' burn my skin
I talk with your first cousin Georgia
Heard what happened from the news reporter
You're surrounded by clouds, thunder and lightening sounds and now the sun is falling down

Tell me why you don't love your black babies the same
Why you be calling them out of the name?
Where the son of a judge can hold a grudge and take a life away
And be free the next day
Feels like a hurricane
The weather so strange.

Ohh, Florida something's very wrong
Need to know what's going on?
Can we make this house a home,
Oh oh Florida can I talk to you?
Can you walk and have an interview
Florida this land is overdue
Oh my my my my my",Florida

It's unrealistic what you're looking for in a man

You know what you want but you don't know what you need
Good sex, monogamous, keeps all of his promises
Handsome, its all bless
No kids, I think you oughta share a psychiatrist
Bank account got a figure 6
Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent
The only problem is, he don't exist

I think you need the invisible man
So you can never see his flaws and mistakes
Better come get this loving while you can
Waiting to hit the jackpot grand prize sweepstakes
Quit listening to friends when they try to tell you how to feel
Making you believe there's something out there that aint real
Don’t mean to alarm you, no prince coming to charm ya
And the perfect man you're waiting for, he don't exist
Oh, la la la ay

Sorry to shatter your perfect picture of love
This ain't no movie, ain't no director yelling cut,
Everyone's an actor, you gotta stick to the script
You want a fairytale but they just don't exist
You want a knight in shining armor
Hero that come to save ya ride through the skyline
Red cape, baby let me set the record straight
If you don’t know what to settle for
You lose it all
'Cause it just don't exist

I think you need the invisible man

That time that you're spending, looking for happy ending
Babe it can start with us
Subtract all of the baggage and maybe we can manage
A life that equals up to love
We'll never know the visions I'll play my position
Be patient baby no need to rush
You want to most with a ghost let me coast
You about to miss out on this
'Cause he don't exist

I think you need the invisible man
So you can never see his flaws and mistakes
Better come get this loving while you can

Hold the tail on your gown
Angel on earth

I didn't have to lick it baby how was I to know that
I'd end up acting like a kitty cat over your milk

Get thrown and break apart the very heart of a home,
The louder you shout, you cuss each other out
It's get hard to figure out what you're fighting about.
Sticks and stones, now she's gone
Because the words you say they hurt her.

Listen! It's hard to be a man,
You could never fall off of your pose
Have your emotions, keep your enemies close
And the ones we love the most they never know it
'Cause he get all cut up, chasin' paper and never show it,
But she'll stay up and wait, for you to walk in late
Then ask you, where you been, now here we go again
When she know that you've been out hustling,
But you don't think like arguing I'm fussing, no

Oh no no,
No, just put that hand back there ain't no need for that
And that's for real, real, for real
My words last for days, just tell her how you feel

When sticks and stones, skeleton bones
Get thrown and break apart the very heart of a home,
The louder you shout, you cuss each other out
It's get hard to figure out what you're fighting about.
Sticks and stones, now she's gone
Because the words you say they hurt her.

It's hard to be a man
You can never buckle under the stress
Can't make excuses, you'll get put to the test
Can't think and drink just a mile out the voices,
Of all the bad choices you make
But she'll stay up and wait, for you to walk in late
And ask you where you been and here we go again
When she knows that you been out hustling
And you don't feel like arguing or fussing
No, no no, no no.

Oh no no,
No, just put that hand back there ain't no need for that
And that's for real, real, for real
My words last for days, just tell her how you feel

When sticks and stones, skeleton bones
Get thrown and break apart the very heart of a home,
The louder you shout, you cuss each other out
It's get hard to figure out what you're fighting about.
Sticks and stones, now she's gone
Because the words you say they hurt her.

Shes crying on the floor
Before you knew it, now you got the cops outside your door
Nosey neighbours watching and she told you once before
She couldn't take it any longer but instead you just ignored her heart
So now she's packing and leaving

Sticks and stones, now she's gone
Because the words you say they hurt her.",Sticks N Stones

What she really means when she says all that?
She just ain't feeling the love, oh, Lord
What she really means when she says pussy there
And baby, come here, tonight can we do something special?
What she really means when she says all that?
Just get ready to put in some work

She's never gonna give you the map to her heart
She's never gonna show you the place where to start
She's never gonna help you to figure out
Forever be a mystery what love's all about
You gotta read between the lines and see
You gotta go where no man's gone before
You gotta reach real deep inside her dreams
And that's when you'll find out what she really means

What she really means when she says she doesn't really need a gift?
All she ever needed was your arms around her and your lips to kiss, yeah, yeah
What she really means when she says all that?
Don't you come home empty handed, she ain't gonna understand it
And what she really means when she gets out of hand, in your face
Calling you everything but your God given name
And what she really means when she says all that?
She wants to know that you're strong enough to put her back in her place

She's never gonna give you the map to her heart
Never gonna show you the place where to start

She wants you to work hard like you tryna solve a jigsaw puzzle
Pick a lock, crack the code, she wants to know she's worth the trouble
And she wants to be leaded and she wants to believe it
When she stirs into your arms

Never gonna give you the map to her heart
Never gonna show you the place where to start
Never ever gonna help you to figure out

You gotta go where no man's gone before

I've seen the ocean in the morning while it's calm
And I've seen a baby sleeping in his mother's arms
And I've seen couples find each other in the dark
And I see us together again, even if only in my heart
I, I've seen colors on a canvas turn to art
And I've seen people who search for answers in the stars
And I've seen days when no one talks to me but God
I can see us together again, even if only in my heart

I keep a photo in my wallet of us too
I keep on dreaming every dream I have is you
Keep saying I throw it away but never do
Keep wondering when did I become the shameless fool
Keep saying do you ever think of me at all
Keep praying that it's you each time when someone calls
Keep thinking why the hell is we even apart
I keep holding out hope for us, if only in my heart

To free my heart and let my mind astray
This feeling that I feel is hard to trace
It takes my soul right into outerspace
So lost but almost found in misbelief
The tenderness of being in between
An ego that I force myself to feed
Ignoring what I want for what I need
I wanna emphasize on your blessings
Loving you in your sections
Doing full time when I check in

Yeah

Tempted by feelings that feel so familiar, uh
Blinded by love and all of the above
Taking by wishes with no permission permitted
I hate that my lifestyle has caused you to think that I'm not committed
The more that I say I don't want it, I know that I need it
You take it away and let me do all the fiening
You know how much I crave you
You know how much I hate to
But you give me that discipline then put some cinnamon on it
Girl damn you're so sweet to me
Do what you wanna
I could kiss on your feet you got all of the heat on me
Your winning me over
I hate being sober just doesn't feel the same anymore
It's felt in my vein I'm so over the games
But there's no one to blame anymore

If you could tell me now, baby tell me what it is
I been looking for an answer, yeah
You done put me through the test, we couldn't be just friends
Got me thinking about the masses
How far could we take it if we lifted off
Would you hold me down when things start to pick up
So far left I would hope to get it right this time
Hate to think I barely ever cross your mind
But I think about it way too much
How you gone get fucked up and tell me it's nothing
Inside it kills tell me how it feel when you really can't feel nothing
Stuck on my words why does it hurt
Every time I say something 
Sometimes it hit so hard you aim to be numb, but

If it doesn't feel the same anymore 
It's all on me, it's all on me
There's no one to blame anymore

Ask about Jai Blizz, I get bread in the streets
And let me get some papers wit the feds in the sheets
I ain't going to the pen, i'm putting lead in the sheets

No it's not flour, except when it's May

What you wanna get rid of, weed, extasy, or crack?

I ain't even signed and i'm feeling like a veteran
J.A.I. B.L.I.Z.Z, your bitch might go to bed with him
Balls in her mouth, now her neck look like a pelican
Phone ringing, it's a sell again
You can get it two ways like you drinking Culligan
Get rid of it, re up, now my pockets full again
Blowing blunts in the cold, the police think i'm blowing wind
Right in front of the police station, nigga i'm hoeing them
Get big packs from my connect but never am I owing them
Money trees i'm growing them

Look at my track record, 3 sales to the law
Pistol charge in Atlanta with a shell in the jaw
And I can name others, I'm just giving the outline
And I can talk about it in a song without lying
And if you owe me nigga you ain't leaving without mine
Niggas catch cases and they turn like house blinds
Keep ya mouth closed, don't talk like clown mimes

Ima get u right how u like, can u handle it?
And how u on dem tights got me starin at dem camel lips
Fidda fat, ima put u on yo back
Ima ima get the whipped cream n put it on ya lap
Bring it back, bring it bring it back shawty bring it back
Have u hittin high notes like u singing on the track

Ain't used to being sweet cause my pride get cavities
Have most chicks mad at me
Play a hoe academy
Beat it like da Energizer, dont run out of batteries
So my sex drive is kinda like a drag race
Give her a little run then leave her wit da sad face
Tell her brush her teeth so her mouth dont have a bad taste
But got a weakness for thick chicks wit a sad face
So tell ur man pack the Uhaul truck
Time to break up like u rackin pool balls up
What i call fate is what u call luck
Rather'd have u seperate than get u caught up
Started out as cut friends, then u gettin intimate
Had a man and had me on the side like a dinner mint
See where it's going, whole outcome is imminent
But I ain't tryna leave ya heart broke like it's indigent

Smile lookin priceless
Had ya heart cold, mean nothin i can icefish
Cooler than a icepick
Say u like the way im on the mic sick
Get her right, beat it like a night stick
And leave da handcuffs, i don't ever use those
Im juat tryna get fresh like im tryin new clothes
New nose-fate love's vicious as a blue nose
Had to make a point like Pacman chasin blue ghosts
So take it by the day, no better yet the second
I ain't tryna get double-crossed like an intersection
I know i been a blessin, and that i say likewise
Thought of being lesbian and said u didn't like guys
Nice thighs shorty, ain't really good wit compliments
Ain't used to being sweet but a 100 wit my confidence

Got 20 years probation then went to prison 18

Told these niggas be quiet
Told the guards to try to try it
Losing weight like a diet
Out here on the grind
Tell me i'm losing my mind
Nigga if I get confined I will never drop a dime
And it's more than rhymes
Nigga went into Atlanta
On my 4th day my brother called and said I had that hammer
That nigga was gay man ain't nothing else to say
But they gave me fucking 5 years probation God saved my day
While I was on paper for the gun I didn't run
I was still selling crack, and sold to an informant shit is dumb

No descriptions, you wouldn't know how to react/
And living on Broadway, you don't know when they'll come back/
Not only that, dumb cats strive for pettiness/
Jealousy attracts to who's bank's the heaviest/
I can see how mom's felt when she chose to move/
Plain tired of the bullshit and so confused/
Then i'm noticing mom's barely ever at home/
So I'm wit Denise's family more than my own/
And rest in peace Robert, it's a shame that you're gone'/
The father I never had, If I needed, you had it/
Got on me about school and how I needed my ass kicked/
Put my report card on top of your casket/
Can't forget about Magic, heard what happened and cried for him/
Used to be like ""that's my lil' nigga, i'll die for him""/

And even though i'm gone, know you're still in my heart

I was one of the less fortunate growing up/
Getting teased 'cause I ain't have the Nike's or Chucks/
Watchin' the other shorty's chase the ice cream trucks/
No older siblings so I was always getting beat up/
When I was hungry there wasn't much that we could eat up/
Turn on the kitchen light you see cockroach legs/
Scared to eat the noodles 'cause of cockroach eggs/
All my pants just long enough to cover my legs/
Livin' wit 9 heads, just a couple of beds/
The kid in the school that you'd tease alot/
Jean shorts in December so I freeze alot/
The worse haircut and the littlest kid/
And everytime I got a Sega fiends broke in the crib/
Maybe girls didn't like I had no game/
Maybe bullies didn't like I had the brains/
Whoever came to the crib I would ask for change/
And I bet noone thought that my ass would change/

So hungry that my ribs and back touch/
And the cold got my lips bout to crack up/
I wish I could back up and change this life/
A trust fund and a home woulda made this right/
Probably not, watchin' mufuckas chase the pipe/
And at night crackfiends come and take my bike/
So in elementary the 1st B to the face/
Then I started getting high like Ko-be from the base/
Using old milk crates for our B Ball hoops/
Getting clowned 'cause I was wearing Bugle Boy's wit boots/
No luxury or loot, just a couple of dreams/
Where to start? 5 shirts and a couple of jeans/
Me and my guys on a scheme 'cause that's all we knew/
So stealin' or startin' fights'll be all we do/

Torment and humiliation- sum you can avoid/
Don't tell 'em where i'm from, out of towners get annoyed/

Sustained through the pain- state and name in the tat/
Let 'em know bout where I came from- maintain where I'm at/
Can't refrain from the facts/
The blood that was running in my vain in the trap/
Then it went from my heart from my brain to the track/
Only way you feel the same, got banged slanging crack/
Never told a name, not a soul, not a thang/

25 years, spent 5 locked up/
6 years no home, how the pain popped up/
The rain popped up- on several occasions/
No ponchos, umbrellas, or evasions/
No equations- most of my middle school/
Kept writing music- Never was a little fool/
Never can you ridicule- me or humiliate/
Circle of a sucka, pimpin' never I'll affiliate/
Vocabulary fine- I ain't even graduate/
Indicted 17- and had to emancipate/
Went and got my GED, but don't think it's good enough/
7 felonies damn- tell me that ain't hood enough/
Screw that silly ish- cause I really wish/
That I went to college where the women is the prettiest/
But I hung with idiots/
Mistakes what they really is/

Where my mind at? Man it's in another state/
Where my daughter at? With her step-dad Mom/
Mine ain't seen her in a year- man yes that's wrong/
Gotta stay strong cause i'm Mama's only son/
Who gone put Minneapolis on? Man i'm the only one/

Quarterback vision lookin' over ya shoulder
Got chips on mines
In bag's like Santa's, big clips on 9's
Trade bread for bananas 
Ya kick's start dippin'
Turn ya fits to pajamas
No cuffs on my wrists, handkerchiefs and bandannas

I will run on you clowns like Dunn for the down
And if somebody frown
Bad pass status, throw guns to the ground
In a black hood, not a nun in her gown
Throw this nigga a party, be the talk of the town
Playa take ya swing, i'm at the top of the mound
You want it on ya head, i'm at the top of the crown
You wanna be on square 'till the shit turn round
And you only cold hearted 'till the bitch burn down

Dog don't bark at me when you better growl wit me
Even when i'm away I got a home crowd wit me
Don't get bitchy I got itchy loud as Whitney's prime
And you will be bigger talk than 50's nine
Keep it conservative and reserve the peace
Or you will need a helmet to preserve ya teeth
1st and least for fam I will birth ya peace
And for anything smaller nigga murk ya speech
Kill everything you saying before I burp this piece
Baby 380 try to rob me reimbursed at least
Keep heat by my dough like Perkin's grease
Keep bitches in line like perfect teeth

Get this nigga a toe tag and confirm his feet

Know you're tired of the lies
They said rap died, but ima make it revive
August 85 fell a star from the sky
Im tryna make it, I ain't tryna make it by

Half these cat's can't even see me, and they ain't even blind
Know ima be a mogul and I ain't even signed
Sayin I ain't gone shine, can't hear it, you're a mime
Nevermind your piece of mind, i'm blowin' up-no mine
Seeing gold, no mine
Cause i'm going for mine and- Hip Hop a jungle-
The microphone is the vine and- it without me you're probably missing the Li-on
Cause I am the truth, you're probably missin' the lying
I am- what the game's missing like the 3rd string
So hip hop' gonna inherit me like a birth gene
Don't feel right being broke like your 1st sling
So these haters lips flap more than a bird wing
Any obstacle you bring- I'll overcome it
That star that you wish on, im gonna become it
They tryna put Minneapolis on, I think I done it
The race for the Pioneer face, think I won it

Sometime I see my manz
RIP Magic, died in someone else hands
I can see through- these cats that's seafood
Can't understand these shrimps, they speakin in Hebrew
Everything I say cold, I'm speaking in Igloo
Pull my mirror out like ""they don't need to believe you""
These cat's is D2- I'm in a different league
That's why I don't show no fatigue when I breathe dude
I'm just just tryna breeze through- this lil' rap game
While these informants'll remember ya last name
I'm just tryna ""act"" sane- crazy bout the crack game
Cause when the cash came- I was in the fast lane
Cheverlot heavy yay- make the gas the gas drain
Dodged so many snakes- my shirt got grass stains
Relax mane, why u so uptight?
Got my vision at the stars, sitting so upright

I'm fed up I can't get my meals super sized
Wish for a bluer sky
Switched to a new attire
Said this beat reminded me of Kanye Through the Wire
Who am I? Magic In Your Eyes
Like Dwight Howard
5""7 but i'm feeling quite taller
Shawty that like ballers
Tell her that I might call her
Job's not white collar
Doing dirt like nightcrawlers
And all my guts doin' life in the squalor-
Thanks for the light- to my sight -to my power
I'll shoot u a kite when the time get right- and them cats I disliked- don't slip in the shower
I was flipping powder- mother wasn't proud of-
Me- said you'll get booked- why'd I have to doubt her
Fat lady singing, every note get louder

Who you are

You know this don't feel
Right
Who knows what we feel?

See I just met you and I
Can read your thoughts
What they tell me is what
I want

I'll keep you guessing
Keep you wanting more
'Cause where we're going
No one knows

You know this don't feel
Right
Who knows this could feel
Right

See I just met you I
Swear I read your thoughts
So don't forget me or
What you want

Ooo
Ooo

Light up the stage
Make your move
Give me something
So I can dance
In your light
And to your rhythm

Soon it unfolds
Who we are
In this mascaraed
Of scars
Tear off the mask
The face you hide
Is what I'm missing

We made plans to kiss
The sun at night
Hopeless dreamers and
Hopeless hearts

See one was turning
And one was standing
Still
I won't forget what
Was promised here

You know this don't
Feel right",Plans

It's like you never see you

I'd give the world up just to hold you

I'd give the world up just to hold you

Jaida Dreyer,"An empty pack of Marlboro reds sittin' by the bed
I can still see mama crying on the phone
And I sorta still remember who I was that September
Before she told me he was really gone

I ran and got my plastic ponies but he just kept on going
I thought he'd turn around but I know better now

Ooh, you can't fence 'em in,
Ooh, they were born to run and then
You think you got them where you want 'em
Then they leave you all alone
Half broke horses, they never come back home

I've tried hard not to be like mama, but blood's thicker than water
And I fell for the way he said my name
And we made love wild and crazy, he wanted me to have his baby
But I should've known there's some things you can't change

I stood on the front porch cryin' but he just kept on driving
I thought he'd turn around but I know better now

Ooh, you can't fence 'em in,
Ooh, they were born to run and then
You think you got them where you want 'em
Then they leave you all alone
Half broke horses, they never come back home

Now I watch that little girl by the window as she plays
Those plastic ponies are a story, she's gonna have to hear someday
She's gonna need to hear me say

You can't fence 'em in, no, no
Cause they were born to run and then
You think you got them where you want 'em
Then they leave you all alone

When my life is almost gone
Hear my cry, hear my call
Hold my hand lest I fall

Porque de mañana y noche mi bien,
Recados de amor traería

Si una vez fuera sirena, seguro te embrujaría
Con magia de caracolas, mi amor, cangrejos y algas marinas

Y si fuera golondrina, conmigo te llevaría
Con la luna y las estrellas mi bien entre nubes te amaría

Y sin embargo, solo soy una mujer que ama el amor
Y sin embargo, solo soy una mujer

Es por eso que no puedo tenerte en casa algún día
Vago sola por el mundo mi bien y sola me moriría

Dime que haré golondrina, sirena y paloma
Para retener al hombre mi amor, que yo
Siempre adoraría

Entre las cosas que hago, y las que digo
Va siempre conmigo, es mi sombra fiel

No es ningún juego de niños, estar como estoy
No como, no duermo, no vivo, pensando en su amor
Siempre creí que los celos, eran un cuento
y son el infierno, que arde sin control

Quien me lo iba a decir
Que también a mi me robaría la razón

Mio, ese hombre es mio
A medias pero mio, mio, mio
Para siempre mio
Ni te le acerques es mio
Con otra pero mio, mio, mio

Con tal de defender lo que quiero, morir o matar

Va matando sueños, en tu corazon

Jailhouse,"You kissed your loved one goodbye
On a cold foggy day
I guess you didn’t know
That I’d go so far away
At 1:45
We cried on a runway
I’m not leaving home forever
Only several days

So take my heart
I’ve already taken yours
This bruise won’t heal

I’m alone and cold inside
Is there a moment we haven’t shared
Two hearts drawn as one
Now sit on an empty chair
You said to me last night
I’ll be waiting for your kiss
Now I lie here and cry
As I dream all the things I’ve missed

So take my heart
I’ve already taken yours
This bruise won’t heal

Tell me
Do you miss me
Like I miss you girl
Hold me in your heart
I’ll never be lost again
Tell me
Do you miss me 
Like I miss you girl
Hold me in your heart
I’ll never be lost again

Inside of me
I need you to wake me

Tan inmenso es este frio sin ti
Tan desierto, tan perdido

Como lagrimas de hielo en mi sufrir
Y vuelve alzar el vuelo, el veneno de este anhelo
Por tenerte al despertar, y poder una vez mas amarte

Que solo existe la medida de tu piel y mi piel

Cual fue mi error para perderte
Estoy muriendo por no verte

Y esquivas cada trampa del destino
Como conviertes en cruz las pesadillas
Y pones a tus miedos de rodillas
Como es que vuelas aun contra corriente
Y brillas única entre tanta gente
Mi amor te sigue veloz como el sonido
Despierta el sueño que creí perdido
Es muy difícil de explicar, tuve que vivir
En otra piel para saber que eres mi lugar.

Porque por ella soy eva, cada paso es una prueba
Este corazón se eleva y ya no quiere aterrizar
Porque por ella soy eva, cruzo el límite del viento
Crees inmenso lo que siento y tengo un buen
Presentimiento sé que pronto me amaras.

Y que el pasado no es irrelevante
Que la distancia es un error gigante
Y dame un beso que cause un terremoto
Dibuja puentes en mi cielo roto
Quiero tatuarme tus huellas digitales
Desordenar los puntos cardinales
Ganarle al tiempo seguir tus huellas
Beber de golpe todas las estrellas
Es muy difícil de explicar, tuve que vivir
En otra piel para saber que eres mi lugar.

Jaime Jamgochian,"I used to wish that I could rewrite history
I used to dream that each mistake could be erased
Then I could just pretend
I never knew the me back then

I used to pray that You would take this shame away
Hide all the evidence of who I've been
But it's the memory of the place You brought me from
That keeps me on my knees and even though I'm free

Heal the wound but leave the scar
A reminder of how merciful You are
I am broken, torn apart, take the pieces of this heart
And heal the wound but leave the scar

I have not lived a life that boasts of anything
I don't take pride in what I bring
But I'll build an altar with the rubble that You've found me in
And every stone will sing of what You can redeem

Heal the wound but leave the scar
A reminder of how merciful You are
I am broken, torn apart, take the pieces of this heart
And heal the wound but leave the scar

Heard the sound of you calling my name
Now I am complete

Misplaced trust and honesty
Should have known the time to leave
Close my eyes and imagine I was blind
Opened up and said too much
Parts of us remained untouched
Keep them locked in side my mind

I heard you calling to me (you called to me)
I know now I am complete (i am complete)
What's lost in the moment got carried away 
Heard the sound of you calling my name
Now I am complete

Unsaid words comunicate 
Think the time will never take
Look for me and I'll do the same in time
Now tomorrow seems so clear 
Whisper softley to your ear 
Keep me safe locked inside your mind

I heard yo calling to me (you called to me)
I know now I am complete ( iam complete )

Heard the sound of you calling my name
Now I am complete

I know now I am complete ( I am complete)

Jair Rodrigues,"No meio da roda eu não marco bobeira
Eu entro na roda e não levo rasteira
Lá no terreiro eu levanto a poeira
É roda de samba e tem capoeira
Menina baiana que desce a ladeira
Sambando na roda não é brincadeira
Pego a menina e caio na zoeira
É roda de samba e tem capoeira

Pega a viola que eu quero te ver sambar
Firma o batuque pro nego cantarolar
Eu quero ouvir mais palmas, mais palmas
Mais palmas sem parar
É roda de samba que tem capoeira

Felicidade!
Passei no vestibular
Mas a faculdade
É particular

Livros tão caros
Tanta taxa pra pagar
Meu dinheiro muito raro
Alguém teve que emprestar
O meu dinheiro
Alguém teve que emprestar

Morei no subúrbio
Andei de trem atrasado
Do trabalho ia pra aula
Sem jantar e bem cansado
Mas lá em casa
À meia-noite
Tinha sempre a me esperar
Um punhado de problemas
E criança pra criar

Para criar!
Só criança pra criar
Para criar!
Só criança pra criar

Mas felizmente
Eu consegui me formar
Mas da minha formatura
Não cheguei participar
Faltou dinheiro pra beca
E também pro meu anel
Nem o diretor careca
Entregou o meu papel

O meu papel!
Meu canudo de papel
O meu papel!
Meu canudo de papel

E depois de tantos anos
Só decepções, desenganos
Dizem que sou um burguês
Muito privilegiado
Mas burgueses são vocês
Eu não passo
De um pobre coitado
E quem quiser ser como eu
Vai ter é que penar um bocado
Um bom bocado!
Vai penar um bom bocado
Um bom bocado!
Vai penar um bom bocado
Um bom bocado!
Vai penar um bom bocado

E canjiquinha pra comer
Mas ladainha lá na minha casa

E canjiquinha pra comer

Se tem alguém aflito
Todo mundo chora
Todo mundo sofre
Mas logo se reza

Todo mundo dança

Dinheiro pra que dinheiro
Se ela não me dá bola
Em casa de batuqueiro
Só quem fala alto é viola

Venha depressa, correndo pro samba
Porque a lua já vai se mandar
Afina logo a sua viola
E canta samba até o sol raiar

Mas, dinheiro pra que dinheiro

Aquela mina não quis me dar bola
Eu tinha tanta grana pra lhe dar
Chegou um cara com uma viola
E ela logo começou a bolar

Dinheiro pra que dinheiro

Eu era um cara muito solitário
Não tinha mina pra me namorar
Depois que eu comprei uma viola
Arranjo nega em qualquer lugar

Dinheiro pra que dinheiro

Eu tinha grana
Me levaram a grana
Fiquei quietinho
Nem quis reclamar
Mas, se levarem
A minha viola, não me segura
Porque eu vou brigar

Dinheiro pra que dinheiro 

Pára depressa com essa viola
Porque o samba já vai terminar
Eu vou depressa correndo pra casa
Pegar a marmita pra ir trabalhar

Dinheiro pra que dinheiro",O Pequeno BurguĂŞs
Jair Rodrigues,"O dia amanhece como todo dia,
Mas já não brilha desde que você partiu
Sem avisar foi, no vento sumiu
E num assopro me deixou esse vazio

A noite escurece como toda noite,
Mas já não existe boemia e nem luar
Tudo entristeceu, não há mais lugar
Pra poesia da alegria de amar

Mas ontem mesmo eu sonhei com a sua volta,
E no meu sonho a tristeza não está
Tu me pedindo pra que eu abrisse a porta,
E eu sorrindo, mal podia acreditar

Então entravas perfumando o caminho,
E eu sozinho me prestava a admirar
Ah se eu soubesse de um jeito que eu pudesse
Transformar a vida em sonho, não iria acordar",Vida Em Sonho

Make a new sound
Open up my mouth to let it out
Set it free

Turning around
Where was one to question to the rain
Now can be one fine day
One fine day is today
One fine day (day)
One fine day

Catching a wave
May no change, may no feelings
Pulling me in, this time nobody too

Better be brave
Cocked in the sunlight and the cave
I must choose

Comin' of age
Even my mistakes have turned the page
I won't loose one fine day
One fine day is today
One fine day (day)
One fine day

Ohoooo!

I know life can be what simmers in your heart
One fine day
I know everyone exactly as they are, who you are?
One fine day
One fine day is today
One fine day

Jakatta,"A world of trouble, betrayl and deceit
Hiding in the shadows, there's terror in the streets
It came without warning, no one heard the call
Dark clouds are falling, the black rain will fall

Ride, ride the storm
Ride, ride the storm
The distant fire, burning on the shore
Oh the cities crumble, I hear the gods of war

Screaming for vengeance, there's no hope in sight
Lighting and thunder, striking the night
Ride, ride the storm
Ride, ride the storm

I know, burn in the conscience of every man
You don't have to push me, 'cause I'll make a stand
Won't you let me breathe?
When I go, I give back the freedom to every child

Give me the wisdom, the sadness, the sorrow
But leave me tomorrow
I feel the sunshine on me

You'll see
Just believe
The words I pray 
You'll see

Searching for me in the shadows
The night is so dark
But the future holds something better
I know it's going to be alright

Just tell me what it is that Iím supposed to do 
Cause I'm falling apart on my own 
Without you everyday 
So tell me what to do 

Baby when I close my eyes 
I picture you inside my mind 
I think about you all the time 
Girl why don't you just give me a sign 

Cause I never understood it 
Baby why you made me wait so long

Look into this ice

To whisper in my ear 
And tell me I am loved again 
I feel you inside of me

I never thought that I deserved 
This love I feel inside 
I thought that I was by myself 
But you know everything about me 
You look deep inside 
The motion picture of my life
And even if I fall again 
I know You'll be there for me 
To take me home

I want to know You love me

I am waiting for You
I am waiting here tonight 
I am praying for my eyes to see the light

And that's how I know I am tired of mine

I want You to lift my hands up high

He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me boys
Time - He flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor

Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine

Incestuous and vain, and many other last names

'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed. Your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was the guilt for dreaming

Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like ooh
Ooh too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance

To try and apologize for my mistakes

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours

And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

Down at the car park I saw everyone I knew
And before the night had started we had planned to crash a party
Just a place that someone knew a local house belonging to a gangsters crew
And at the door they shone a light into my face
Have to admit I felt a little out of place
But I made my way inside past a thousand crazy eyes
Then a friend took me aside said everyone here has a knife

I've seen it all
I've seen it all now
I swear to god I've seen it all
Nothing shocks me anymore after tonight

Those little doves had sent my mind and heart a-beating
To say I felt weird really doesn't need repeating
I could sense the mounting tension the atmosphere of violence
And then they took a guy out side and someone stabbed him with a knife

Making up the pavement
Of less traveled roads
Mining for treasure deep in my bones
That I never found

Went looking for reverence
Tried to find it in a bottle
Came back again
High on a hash pipe of good intent
But it only brought me down

Tried institutions of the mind and soul
It only taught me what I should not know
Oh the answer well
Who would have guessed
Could be something as simple as this,
Something as simple as this?

Traveled to each oceans end
Saw all 7 wonders,
Trying to make some sense
Memorized the mantra Confucius said
But it only let me down

Tried absolution of the mind and soul
It only led me where I should not go
Oh and the answer well,
How could I miss
Something as simple as this?
Something as simple as this?

I've been falling crashing breaking
And all the while you were
Stood here waiting

Boy you've missed your payment
And they're gonna find you soon

If there's a beating in the rain
If there's a little bit of pain, man
You're the one it happens to

If I talk of getting out
I only hear the laughter loud
It's gotten ugly at home

Somewhere there's a secret road
To take me far away I know
But til then I am hollow

In this trouble town
Troubles are found
In this trouble town
Fools are found

Sitting on the pavement
Boy you've missed your payment
And they're gonna find you soon

If there's a beating in the street
If there's a feeling of defeat
You're the one it happens to

Stuck in speed bump city
Where the only thing that's pretty
Is the thought of getting out",Trouble Town

As he rises to his fate

And their compromising ways
And as I leave them far behind
I try to hide the route of my escape

You can sit in the pine trees
You can feel at home
You can breathe a sigh of silence in the woods
You can bawl your heart out
Make your feelings known
Things the grass already knows

How in hell can I be safe

You hide them with convulsive rage
You tried to be the best you could be
People finding the most pleasure
All within the smallest treasures

And as we’re walking in the clear night blind
Two guys come up and take him out of sight

They takes his money and they run and all I can do is watch them go
His hands are round his nose
His blood is on his clothes

What doesn’t kill ya
What doesn’t hurt
Sometimes you feel you’re up against the world
What doesn’t kill ya
What doesn’t break

Can bring you to your knees
You try you bleed then finally you breathe

I couldn’t face the world without her eyes
I never knew it till she disappeared
My life would be a bunch of souvenirs
All I know is what it is her heart she doubles up
She packs her bag and then she runs and all I can do is watch her go
I’ve lost all I own

And I don't think that I love ya
I know I'm such a fool

But I'll be waiting by the phone
Waiting on for hours
But I'll be waiting all alone
For a love that's not out

And if suddenly you leave
How we learn to stay?
Cause you don't need a guy like me
Who never wants to dance
Never wants to dance",Never Wanna Dance
Jake Bugg,"When you try to get too close
In your flammable clothes
Step to the flames
But it isn't a taste
Leave it to the rain
Don't put out the fire

Traveling long around
Panicking as the sounds
Moving really fast
So don't put out the fire
Put out the fire

Put out the fire

When you're trynna be so smart
When the forest ain't so dark

Grow with the breeze
You wake up on your runny

Put out the fire
It will catch real soon
And take you to your (une
It's closing in quick
So you better put out the fire
Put out the fire

Put out the fire

When you find yourself in close
In between the hear that rose
Show time to smoke 
Felt it in your throat
The drought provoked you
That you're never putting out the fire

Only in doubt

I'm never gonna breath
Cause I'll never put out the fire

Jake Bugg,"I'm just a poor boy from Nottingham
I had my dreams
But in this world they're gone, they're gone
Oh, I'm so lonesome on my one

Three years on the road, 400 shows
Where do I call home?
No place to go
Where do I belong?
Oh, I'm so lonesome on my one

Every town a stranger when I'm around
No sins forgiven, hell spit me out

Jake Hanna,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Jake Hanna,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand

The moonlight and you in my arms with all your charms

The moonlight and you
Give me a June night
Give me the moonlight
But mostly give me you

And when you're in my arms, 
With all your charms and the moon above
We're gonna make love, love, love

Jake Hanna,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

One who would love you and give you the world.

where she cry, tear stain
Took her hands, coldness
Held her close, weaping
There we stood, moments
Winter's home, gaming

then the moment stops, my heart faint

She whispers ""love, never leave my side""

Jake La Botz,"Stayed for a while in the hollow sound
The only water came up from the ground
Hey, the wishing well, sing it soft and low
My head was mangled and my words were torn
Covered in blood like a newly born
Hey, the wishing well, sing it soft and low
I saw you there, I couldn't refuse 
Had just enough in my pocket to lose
Hey, the wishing well looking cold tonight

Nothing down there can feel the pain
Nothing down there can forgive the crime
Sing it soft. Sing it low
Sing it to your self
Sing it all night

Bent a lot of time in the garbage can 
Fighting over food with the garbage man
Hey, the wishing well sing it soft and low
None of them scraps ever fed my soul
None of that smell ever left my nose
Hey, the wishing well looking cold tonight

Nothing down there can feel the pain
Nothing down there can forgive the crime
Sing it soft. Sing it low
Sing it to your self
Sing it all night

We passed a jug with hands like lead
Cast about as much shadow as the dead
Hey, the wishing well, sing it soft and low
I laid down there with a tone-deaf leech
Came up swinging at a figure of speech
Hey, the wishing well looking mighty cold tonight

Nothing down there can feel the pain
Nothing down there can forgive the crime
Sing it soft. Sing it low
Sing it to your self

Jake La Furia,"Ah
Jake
Tra poco questa scena sarà solo una carcassa
Nel rap è come nella vita frate tutto passa
Io non torno per il rullante, torno per la cassa
Mi dicono Mr La Furia bentornato a casa

Dammi ste ventuno lettere che le trasformo in dinero
Sono stato di più a funerali che feste
Perciò vesto sempre di nero
Chiudimi dentro una gabbia co' sti quattro scemi e vediamo poi chi ne esce intero
Chiamami e trovi occupato, sono impegnato, sto costruendo un impero
Zio, Jake è il mismo di una gran turismo
Cresciuto a cristalli, cavalli, potenza tra le gambe, zio Sex Pistols
Lo sguardo ti ghiaccia la faccia, ho un flow che le casse le schiaccia dentro high pistols
In mano la clava di Fred Flinstones, seduto in ginocchio fra Bill Clinton
Oggi che i rapper non vanno più a tempo, scrivono favole senza senso
Io sottometto sto beat (?) li appendo come ha fatto Tenco 
Non siamo amici se abbiamo brindato, le tue tipe seguono El Chapo (El Chapo)
Non prendono cash da una pompa, sono antifurto, c’ho il cazzo blindato (c’ho il cazzo blindato)
A Milano respiri violenza, fra ci piove sangue dal cielo
Tu spari cazzate non sei un pistolero, fra poi ti fai male davvero
Abbiamo coca, cash, oro bianco, Mase, Range, Porsche, Lambo
Donpè, Crystal, Moet, champo’, denti d’oro, boss El Chapo
Sono stato in silenzio non me ne sono mai andato
Scoppio al momento giusto come le bombe di stato
Il rap è morto, oggi punto e a capo
Tutti sull’attenti fra è tornato El Chapo

Sono un dio sulle casse (dio sulle casse)
Euro, money, cash nelle tasche
Sono un dio sulle casse (dio sulle casse)
Euro, money, cash nelle tasche

Sono arrivato qua sopra passando un inferno alla volta
Dei soldi è quello che mi importa
Non chiedo permesso io entro sfondando la porta
Oggi io nuoto qua in mezzo ai piragna, chi crede all’amore si sbaglia
Al massimo le offro una cena di Chappi talmente ha la faccia da cagna (la faccia da cagna)
Sono tornato, come gli schiaffi se dati nel posto sbagliato (nel posto sbagliato)
Sono tornato, come la bamba col bicarbonato (col bicarbonato)
Nella vita ho provato di tutto, tranne a fare dei figli
Mai avuto problemi di droga, ho solo avuto problemi di sbirri
Non fidarti di niente e nessuno, fra questo ho imparato a scuola
Rispetto è solo una parola 
Io tengo la lama già aperta e calpesto l’aiuola
Sto mondo di merda è una banca, fra io sono il passamontagna, sono la pistola
Arriverò in iotta all’inferno, pagando Caronte con pile di fogli viola
Ho il diavolo dentro, frate sono troia
Sta tipa ripete le strofe a memoria
Dice che le lascia qualcosa, zio tipo che adesso le rappo in bocca e lei ingoia
Frate non pensare a me, non pensare al cash
Pensa solo alla salute (solo alla salute)
Scendimi al volo dal cazzo
Però senza il paracadute

Sono stato in silenzio non me ne sono mai andato
Scoppio al momento giusto come le bombe di stato
Il rap è morto, oggi punto e a capo

Jake La Furia,"Baci sopra le guance, coltelli dentro alle pance
Il successo non ci nobilita e la strada non ci fa piangere
Legati mani e piedi
Testa al domani e cuore a ieri
Dentro i salotti ricchi e barocchi
E dai pippotti dentro ai quartieri
A me non mi disseta sbocciare, non mi toglie fame il caviale
Non è una collana o un bracciale che cambia il tessuto sociale
Senza la gente non sono niente
Sono un pusher senza il cliente
Il veleno senza il serpente, io ci campo sulle leggende

Io voglio solo spiegare le ali
Osservare la vita dall’alto e tornare nel posto in cui ho avuto i natali
Restare con i comuni mortali
Non sono mai davvero contento
Ho sempre in testa quel senso
Nella suite o nel cemento
Non so qual’è il mio posto e il mio tempo
Vorrei tagliare la corda ma la strada mi incolla le Jordan
Guardare per terra, arrivare secondo
Prendersi il mondo
Mela della discordia

Sono ali e radici, oro e champagne
Oppure sangue e sacrifici
Sono un mare di soldi, un mare di merda
Sono le mie cicatrici

Abbiamo le ali ed il coraggio
Radici all’atterraggio
Qual è il senso del viaggio?
I soldi o gli amici?
Se siamo solo di passaggio
Sogno un cuore di ghiaccio e il calore di un abbraccio
Ali e radici

Preparati al decollo
Per diventare immortali
Volare lontani, non ho radici
Strette intorno al collo
Raccontano che il domani
È di chi ha le ali

Siamo fatti di incubi e sogni
E di santi che scalano i giorni
La famiglia, gli amici, gli amori
A sto punto sono solo lussi o bisogni
A noi chi ci tiene legati
Cuori spezzati amici d’infanzia pregiudicati
Come fare a volare senza farci dire che siamo cambiati
Cosa mi dice lo specchio
Cosa?
Mi guarda sorride mi parla all’orecchio
Poi dice fottili tutti e scopale tutte
Perché fra un po’ sarai vecchio
Sempre col diavolo sopra la spalla
Angelo scuote la testa e non parla
Perché la verità è sempre una merda
È più divertente ascoltare la palla

Ora queste ali pesano meno
Se conquisto un pezzo di cielo
Se recido queste radici
Sotto la strada in mezzo al veleno
Vivo ed io non cerco il perdono
L’ho voluto quello che sono
Non è l’uomo a fare la scelta
Ma la scelta a fare l’uomo
Io vivo un po' nell’oro e un po' nella merda
Ho un occhio chiuso ed un occhio all’erta
Una mano a pugno e una mano aperta
Una carta giù ed una carta scoperta
Ho imparato guardando due mondi
Su ai grattaceli giù ai bassi fondi
Tra gli edifici o alle radici, ora sono pronto per saldare i conti (sì)

Abbiamo le ali ed il coraggio
Radici all’atterraggio
Qual è il senso del viaggio?
I soldi o gli amici?
Se siamo solo di passaggio
Sogno un cuore di ghiaccio e il calore di un abbraccio
Ali e radici
Preparati al decollo
Per diventare immortali
Volare lontani, non ho radici
Strette intorno al collo
Raccontano che il domani
È di chi ha le ali

Mai messo radici
Le ho sempre fumate
Mai avuto le ali
Scarpe consumate
Sempre fatto il mio
Anche se non ci credevano in molti
Ci vorrebbe un amico ora che girano tutti sti soldi

Fammi passare dai
Dipende sempre quanto dai
Ogni ragazza porta guai
La verità non conta mai
Tocca lasciare un segno perché siamo tutti di passaggio
Questa vita ha un dito sopra il grilletto e non scherza un cazzo
Dal top al fondo in mezzo c’è un mondo che vale la pena visitare
Mi guardo in torno e se non rispondo è perché sono in preda a crisi varie

Tu cosa cerchi?
Qualunque cosa sia là non nascosta bene
Oh bella Jake era da troppo che aspettavo un pezzo insieme
I rapper che spaccano oggi sono cresciuti sopra due dischi
Dal 2004 pompano Mister Simpatia e Mi Fist
Amici che vengono altri che vanno e chi li ha mai più visti
Lo vedi alla fine abbimo sfruttato anche i momenti tristi

Abbiamo le ali ed il coraggio
Radici all’atterraggio

Jake La Furia,"Se fossi bello potrei
Giocare a calcio anche se non sono capace
Potrei
Fare successo con musica che non piace
Potrei essere famoso e invece mi sbatto
Per fare i singoli e gioco solo alla play
Vorrei fare delle interviste
Con l'aria misteriosa e triste
Dire luoghi comuni alle riviste
Dire ""governo ladro"" e intanto passare per figo
Tanto se sono bello
Chi è che ascolta quello che dico 
Vorrei spacciare per geniali
Pezzi tipo, raga dai su le mani
Roba che manco i cani
E via coi complimenti dei critici musicali
E per scriverla mi bastava
Aver fatto le elementari

Infatti suscita collere
Non sa fare un cazzo
Ma c'ha un milione di followers

Serve soltanto essere bello, felice e contento

Le mie amiche fanno il book dal fotografo
Scroccano le ferie sempre a Dubai e Monaco
Io non ho capito cosa fanno
Ma se guardo le foto
Sembra che sono in vacanza tutto l'anno
Le belle non diventano mai vecchie
Han sempre un bicchiere in mano
Ma sono sempre più secche
Han sempre uno che sembra nonno
Che paga le borsette
Perché coi soldi dello studio
Loro si pagavano le tette
Postano foto a poppa
Mentre fanno dieci squat
Ancora non ho capito
Chi è il padrone dello yacht
Speriamo che un giorno gratto
Un ""turista per sempre"" e vinco
Perché se non sei bello
L'opzione è vien che sei ricco
L'opzione c'è che ti fai il culo
Dì che ti fai fare il culo
Ma se non sei bello tranquillo
Non te lo fa nessuno

Fuori da qui c’è la vita vera
Se ho fortuna dura una vita intera
In cui ti svegli col trucco di ieri sera
Poi mi sali sopra in canottiera
Tienimi fuori tu da ogni dipendenza
Tienimi anche lontano dalla violenza
La vita comincia adesso, siamo in partenza
Prepara le cose mentre faccio la benza
Sono fuori da qui, fuori per chi
Fuori per te, ci vediamo fuori prendi un tassì
Che ci beviamo tutto il bar e ci amiamo ubriachi
Ma sì, poi faremo i bravi da lunedì
Siamo così felici che quasi facciamo schifo
Mi sento che non rispecchio quello che scrivo
Starò fuori dalla noia finché respiro
Starò fuori dal giro
Tu dammi un bacio e fammi un mojito
Sono fuori dal primo

Come i giorni che non passano mai
Per noi, per noi
Come canzoni che non parlano mai
Di noi, di noi
Che siamo come treni che si perdono
Due stelle che non cadono
Più giù, più giù
Un cielo che oggi sembra più bello che mai

Fuori da qui c’è la primavera
Ci sei tu che sei la prima vera
C’è una luce nuova nell’atmosfera
Mi sento fuori da questa galera
Sono stato sempre all’ultima fila
Ed ho pianto solo con la tequila
Non sono più un pupazzo nella vetrina
Sono uno nessuno e centomila
Lascio la strada come stato mentale
Non voglio male, niente vita
Voglio una vita niente male
Mi han detto fuori c'è tutto ma non l’ho mai saputo
Io fino adesso mi sono soltanto autodistrutto
Ho volato alto, droga rock alcool
Credimi sono stanco frate, cerco altro
C’è profumo di novità
E non esiste profumo in questa città
Ridammi una vita ne hai presa metà
E Milano mi ha detto che ci sta

Come i giorni che non passano mai
Per noi, per noi
Come canzoni che non parlano mai
Di noi, di noi
Che siamo come treni che si perdono
Due stelle che non cadono
Più giù, più giù
Un cielo che oggi sembra più bello che mai

Fuori da qui c’è la vita vera
Fuori da qui c’è la vita vera

Jake La Furia,"Ho riempito la bocca quasi fino a perdere il gusto
Senza dire che è giusto
Distruggo le cose che tocco e di solito non le riaggiusto
Ho provato a spaccare me stesso
Con il sesso, la droga ed il resto
Tutto il male che vedo nel letto la notte è il prezzo per il successo
Ho preso pugni fino a farmi perdere i denti
Fino a farmi perdere i sensi
E non ho imparato niente
Pure meno di quello che pensi
Anche credo nel giorno, meglio del porno
Trenta balordi che mi stanno attorno
Tutti contenti che vado, ma dentro di me, frate, non vedo l’ora che torno
Faccio a pugni col mondo solo per vedere chi aveva le corna più dure
Sembro un pezzo di merda, ma, invece, sono solo un pezzo di sogni e paure
E ho speso più di quello che avevo
In tutto ciò che vedevo
E adesso non ho niente, non ho niente di ciò che volevo
I problemi con la cultura
I problemi con la questura
Non rispetto l’autorità, non era nella mia natura
Ho tradito un amico soltanto
Per avere l’amore al mio fianco
Però lui non mi vede la notte che affogo la testa nel cuscino e piango
Ho camminato su una lama infinita
Finché ho trovato te
A fari spenti, finché ho trovato te
Ed ho sempre riso in faccia alla vita finché ho trovato te
Fra i serpenti finché ho trovate te
E ci alziamo e scopiamo e beviamo e fumiamo
E scommetti che ti amo
E sei qui per me
Ed ho vissuto sempre solo nell’ombra finché ho trovato te
Ma quello che conta è che io ho trovato te

Quando fa troppo caldo vorresti passare al Natale
Con quell’aria glaciale
Quando stai tutto il mese in vacanza vorresti qualcosa da fare
Così quando tutti ti stanno a guardare
Quando tutti ti fanno sentire speciale
Tu vorresti sparire, condurre soltanto una vita normale
Tutti ‘sti flash che mi rubano l’anima
Se ne va tutto dentro una lacrima
Tutti i mostri che vengono a prendermi quando mi sveglio con la pelle madida
Bacio il senso di colpa ogni giorno
Pure se merito tutte le cose che ho intorno
Litigo anche con me stesso, non potrei scendere a patti col mondo
Sai che ho solo riso poco
Ho riso solo per le foto
Ho riso solo per stare al gioco
Odio farmi mettere a fuoco
Per diventare più forte ho mangiato
Volevo bere, però ho tracannato
Frà, Dio lo so quante droghe che ho fatto
Per amore ho soltanto scopato
Ho sacrificato la serenità
Per avere una fetta di ciò che cercavo
Finché ciò che per me è libertà
Con il tempo ha finito per rendermi schiavo
Come hai fatto a raggiungermi a tremila all’ora?
A fermarmi per dirmi “scappiamo”?
Non importa, ma ti amo
Baciami e andiamo
Tira tu il freno a mano

Ho camminato su una lama infinita

Jake La Furia,"Ciao, come va? ho visto che piangi
Sarà tutto il marcio che mangi
È una vita che stai per strada, sola e ti arrangi
Quindi sai, ti capisco, sempre problemi
Quando stai nel letto e tremi
Senti il cuore che batte e ti porta da un’altra parte
Tu con chi stai? con chi passi questa notte?
Da sola al banco a bere i cocktail
Che non fanno domande e ti abbracciano sempre più forte
Cosa hai visto con quegli occhi blu? la Milano dei tabù
Vivi veloce, muori giovane, in chicane il tuo tattoo
Sembra che abbiamo fatto una vita, vissuto insieme
Senza ali e senza catene
I piedi per terra tra i balordi e le scie di sirene
Tu lo sai, tu lo sai come si sta al mondo
Aspettiamo un altro secondo
Poi ti porto via da qua fino all’alba e poi fino al tramonto
E vedrai, rollane una che ci stordisca
Sette veli tipo odalisca
Poi sei nuda che balli come una spogliarellista
Tu raccontami una vita, poi mettimi in bocca le dita
Facciamo ancora due tiri e lo rifacciamo appena è finita
Mandami, mandami, mandami fuori
Mandami, mandami, mandami fuori
Mandami, mandami, mandami fuori
Mandami, mandami, mandami fuori

Cosa c’è?
Parla piano (e svegliamo i vicini, mi sa che abbiamo fatto rumore)
Io e te (gli occhi sempre più piccoli, non sappiamo più neanche le ore)
Sul divano (su mille cuscini, che hanno preso già il nostro sapore)
È così (senza pensare a niente, a tutti i problemi che avevamo intorno)
Lo facciamo (tienimi sempre a mente perché poi ti prometto che torno)
Proprio qui (se qualcuno ci sente, non saprà che ci amiamo da un giorno)
Dove siamo (diversi dalla gente, come fossimo gli unici al mondo)

Ciao, come va? ho visto che gridi
Al telefono e non respiri
E tuo padre che l’hanno beccato di nuovo nei giri
Quindi sai, ti capisco, ne ho conosciuti
Sono stato in branco coi lupi
E tu sei delicata, hai la faccia segnata e dopo ti sciupi
Con chi stai? chi ti fa colare il trucco?
Sembri una che gioca a football
Dai che poi si aggiusta tutto con una Vodka senza succo
Quei tuoi amici di cui ti fidi, sono in giro tutti farciti
E non vedono niente, non sentono niente, neppure se gridi
Invece noi sembra che ci conosciamo
Sei l’unica che non mi ha chiesto una foto
Vorrei baciarti e chiederti se andiamo
Andare fuori a scaldare la moto
Tu lo sai, tu lo sai come si soffre
L’hai provato troppe volte
Si sa che si muore se toccano un cuore con le mani sporche

Tu vedrai, rollane una che ci stordisca
Poi leviamoci dalla pista
Voglio stare con te prima che questa notte finisca
Tu raccontami una vita, poi mettimi in bocca le dita
Facciamo ancora due tiri e lo rifacciamo appena è finita

Jake La Furia,"No sé que fue lo que me pasó
Pero bailando quiero verte
Sólo dime tú cuándo paso a recogerte

La guancia che preme sulla tua guancia
Le labbra che premono sulle labbra
In questo posto in cui il mare incontra la sabbia
Sarà la forza di gravità che ci attacca
Muovilo come fosse un’onda
Come se fossi pronta a muoverlo
Come l’ultima cosa che fai
Finché il mare lava l’impronta, finché il sole tramonta
E racconta di tutti i baci che tu mi dai
Tu non sei come ste tipe, come le loro amiche
Tu sei un biglietto di prima per El Caribe
Il telefono suona però io non rispondo
Sono con te a vedere la fine del mondo

Me gusta como lo mueves y te deja llevar
Tienes un cuerpo que bailando, no puedes parar
Me gusta como lo mueves, tú me pides más
En la disco estás bailando, déjate llevar

Magari sarà solo un sogno, magari durerà una notte
Però la notte più lunga del mondo
La spiaggia ci farà da sfondo
Tu balla baby, balla forte
Fin quando arriva la luce del giorno
Balla come se fossi dentro una bolla che ferma il tempo
Una folla che sta spingendo ma che non ti avrà
Tu sei una foglia nel vento, sei come colla, mi arrendo
Non si controlla, tu dammi una possibilità
Se ti vedo ballare, nel riflesso del mare
Io dieci decimi, a te piace farti guardare
Mi fai muovere il collo fino al colpo di frusta
Sei quella giusta, me gusta

Me gusta como lo mueves y te deja llevar
Tienes un cuerpo que bailando, no puedes parar
Me gusta como lo mueves, tú me pides más
En la disco estás bailando, déjate llevar

Siamo io e te, questa notte ed una bottiglia da bere
Dammi un bacio forte, poi riempi un altro bicchiere

Jake La Furia,"Sveglio di notte, cosa voglio davvero
Voglio tutto quello che vedo, voglio un impero
Questa fame che mi avvelena
Sparami il siero
Non voglio una fetta di terra
Voglio il mondo intero
Quanto si soffre per un desiderio
Rinunciare a guardarti sarebbe come stare in un monastero
Non appoggiarmi su di te a riposo del guerriero
Sarebbe come stare a lutto col vestito nero
Insieme siamo sincronizzati, siamo il bolero
Sei la realtà di un altro, però sei il mio pensiero
Io tra il giusto e lo sbaglio
Sbaglio sempre sentiero
Sarà per una donna che finirò al cimitero
Ma non so dire no ai tuoi fianchi, sembri un Botero
E del resto me ne fotte sempre meno di zero
Faccio davvero poche cose di cui andare fiero
Però non ti so dire no, sarò sincero
Io lo so che male fa
Ricucirsi l’anima
Domani me ne pentirò
Ma oggi non so dire no
Stare su una nuvola
Come una divinità
Il prezzo è caro ed io lo so
Ma oggi non so dire no

Non so che cosa avrò davanti, un salto nel vuoto
Perfino stare su una nuvola sarebbe poco
Abbiamo preso il nostro mondo e gli abbiamo dato fuoco
Mentre tutto bruciava noi siamo scappati a nuoto
Cerco di rimanere a galla, fiore di loto
Con te al mio fianco per sempre
Come sopra una foto
Abbiamo accesso la miccia ed abbiamo fatto il botto
Il resto adesso non conta niente, passato remoto
Io sono bravo solo a incasinare, questo è noto
Prima o poi dovrò rendere tutto quello che ho tolto
Sento la voce del buon senso ma io non l’ascolto
Voglio godermi i miei peccati, non essere assolto
Prendo il destino per il collo finchè non lo scuoto
Tu appoggia il culo sulla sella poi mettiamo in moto
Mi sentirò in colpa un altro giorno in un altro posto
Perchè non posso dirti no ad ogni costo

Io lo so che male fa

Domani me ne pentirò

Jake La Furia,"Il fumo che esce da una grata
Le radici sulla strada
Io scrivo solo la notte, quando la luce se n’è andata
Sarà vero che chi non dorme
Non distingue più le forme
Sarà per questo che la notte per me è una vita unificata
La gente perbene che rientra
Tra i balordi ed i poco di buono
Rallenta, Milano è violenta
Non ti appoggiare alle guglie del Duomo
Col sole fa la dolce vita
Col buio ha il giubbino anti-uomo

Notte magica, accendi la macchina

Elettricità, la notte in città
Come finirà questa notte in città?

Il vetro che si appanna
Bacio il collo a questa birra, è sempre lei la mia compagna
Pronto, ci becchiamo dopo
Nelle luci di una strobo
E seguiamo questa notte mentre lei gira intorno al globo

Le ruote di coca e Martini

Jake La Furia,"Forse sembrerò arrogante
Perché mi sento sempre gli occhi addosso
Ho rinunciato a qualcosa di importante
Solamente per sentirmi grosso
E sono solo in tutte queste stanze
Con un freddo che mi arriva all’osso
Se la mia faccia è solo una fra tante
È colpa della maschera che indosso

Sono arrivato fino a qui con i pugni e l’orgoglio
Adesso ho una collana d’oro vero che soffoca il collo
Sento gli occhi addosso, io sorvegliato speciale
Parlo sporco cosi non ho una coscienza da falsificare
Oggi cosa ci faccio qui senza gli amici con cui vendevo sogni
Quelli con cui puoi stare zitto senza che ti vergogni
Io sto seduto su un trono di cash come Johnny
Contare soldi non cura queste mie notte insonni
Potrei farti uno squillo, potremmo avere un figlio
Ma ti ho persa per un pugno di troie e tacchi a spillo
Che a malapena ricordo la faccia e il nome
Io ho chiuso un sacco di porte, nessuno ormai mi apre più il portone
Stare nel cielo non fa vedere le cose
A un tossico di ricordi fagli mancare la dose
Cerco qualcuno che mi faccia sentire più normale
Sono come un tao con del male dentro del male
Ho faticato ad arrivare qui
Per scoprire che voglio qualcosa di diverso
E voglio dare fuoco a tutti i miei cd
E correre a riprendermi quello che ho perso
Intorno a me mi dicono solo di sì
Non vedo nessun fuoco dentro i loro sguardi
Mi sveglio immaginando che sia ancora qui
Perché non mi dimentico di ricordarti

Che perde qualcuno che perde qualcuno

Ho faticato ad arrivare qui
Per scoprire che voglio qualcosa di diverso
Dall’alto vedo chiaro e la risposta è sì
Siamo davvero soli, frà, in quest’universo
Non credo più alle favole, ho una fila di bambole in questo hotel
Ci gioco, ma è tutto inutile, bimba, se non ho te
E ho fatto tanto per me, ma adesso non ho più amici
E non sto coi piedi per terra, una quercia senza radici
Carati e Dom Perignon e in superficie sto al top
Però dormo male, non vedo mia madre da un po'
Se casa mia è una gabbia, la città è uno zoo
Questa gente mi acclama, io vorrei rompergli l'iPhone

Botte stese, parole spese, situe pese
Soldi buttati, che tanto non conta, frà, quanto paghi
La vita costa, la morte è gratis
Mi squilla il cellu tutte le sere
Qualcuno dice, ci sei tu in tele
Ma è tutto falso, io non sto bene
E da un po' ne ho le palle piene

Tutti non hanno flow
Tutti che perdono l’estro
Dentro un destro come il G.I. Joe

Puzzo di alcool e fumo tagliato
Questa musica la strada piange l'asfalto è bagnato
È venerdì, ogni scemo beve dopo viene qui
L'odio mi si attacca ai polmoni fra come l'eternit
Cosa cambia? Mangio ancora come dieci anni fa
Il fegato dei rapper col Chianti, fra come Hannibal
Non mi sono fatto fottere da questi fogli viola
Rap in plastica ipnotizzato da queste casse Roland
Di questi cash e flash io me ne fotto
Non voglio occhiali Versace ma con la vergogna sotto
So scrivere rap tanto pesante che sembra metal
Quella di oggi non è musica, è come dire droga alla keta
Scrivo rime con l'inchiostro di seta
Cane sciolto Jake è un asceta, un altro pianeta
Lancia testa o croce, va dalla strada alla discoteca
Lo stesso rispetto è lo stesso cuore di pietra, seh
Respira, respira, respira, respira

E poi di nuovo in gabbia e poi di nuovo fuori
Questa musica potrebbe far fare i milioni
Ma è schiava dell'orgoglio che fa fuori i migliori
Al nostro tavolo è sempre pieno di giocatori
E se esce testa vivi, e se esce croce

Conto le merde che ho declassato sto all'angolo giudicato
Il patrimonio genetico di sto stato nel Rap è fallato
Memorie corte, carriera in pensione prematura
Le mosse contano quanto le abilità in scrittura
Non ho mai morso la mano che mi ha cibato
Salvo poi quando quel piatto davanti ne è stato avvelenato
E se l'ambiente davvero poi lo fan le persone
A me sta bene ma è col foglio la mia relazione
Più passa il tempo più resto, para, e non mi interessa
Più cresco più vi detesto, più pesto tengo testa
A sti fumetti cazzetti io c'ho progetti food
E da bollino blu il mio prodotto Cracco verbo shaboo
Vi tengo tutti a ruota, spiaggia d'Ostia negli Ottanta
Con la vena calda e la reputazione sempre intatta
Per darmi un tono non faccio concerti con la band
Se questa merda è testa o croce sono Harvey Dent

Ti spacci per musicista e in bocca lingua da biscia
Perché l'ambizione di essere artista, o vola o striscia
Siamo passati dall'inferno della musica di nicchia
Diretti a un inferno di bimbiminkia
Io ho un cuore in sto purgatorio e tredici anni d'ora d'aria
Col fiato sul collo e sopra la mia testa più di un avvoltoio
Non ho la fame di ottenere sempre il risultato
Sono il risultato di chi ha fame col cuore tritato
Qualcuno indaga qualcuno ha fatto un identikit
Il Rap è morto ucciso da un ferro finto in un videoclip
Il mondo va al contrario fra i poveri hanno le Balenciaga
Come il loro rapper preferito che neanche li caga
Già, che neanche li piscia
Questi colleghi profumano di fragola come le nuvole fumando hashisha
Gioco ogni mano con malizia per me è sempre all-in
E batto cassa prima che il croupier mi fotta in deficit

Perchè la vita è così

Che bello immaginare la vita degli altri
Quando ti svegli presto il lunedì
E mica fai la vita di questi cantanti
Che sono sempre al mare o sugli sci
Hai speso una fortuna per assomigliargli
Senza comprare mai neanche un CD
Se guardi nello specchio hai sempre te davanti
Perchè la vita è così

Il mio paese ha una malattia
È la gente che ci vive, la polizia
È la classe che riscrive la democrazia
Questa non è più una crisi, è un’emorragia
Mamma, voglio fare l’emigrante
Che almeno mi lascino le mutande
Se ho già finito il sangue
E ho studiato una vita per esser grande
Finita che al posto mio c’è il figlio di uno importante
Mamma, per una canna tre mesi e tre botte in testa
L’erba la può fumare soltanto chi la sequestra
Comunque la gente piange e non protesta
Che se va male ti sparano i manifesta
I politici mi sembrano i vecchi criminali
Unti con l’oro al collo e gli occhiali
E puttane, sgravio fiscale, racket legale
Sappi aspettare

Scappa da qui
È un mondo di zombie, senza orizzonti
Scappa da qui
Da questo scempio finché sei in tempo
Scappo da qui
È un mondo di zombie, salvo i miei sogni
Scappo da qui
Io qui non c'entro, io non mi accontento

Di lavoro non se ne parla
Sento solo che la gavetta bisogna farla
Col proverbio adesso l'arte sta da parte
E a nessuno glie ne fotte di insegnarla
Mamma, nelle strade si ammazzano per il calcio
E col naso rotto non si sente più puzza di marcio
Nella mia zona tutto è bruciato oppure è una merda
È rimasta in piedi solo la piazza o la caserma
Ed io non voglio fare le buste, né il carabiniere
Il mio orizzonte non deve finire nel quartiere
La mia tipa ha dato una pillola alla cicogna
In sta fogna non voglio dar vita ad una carogna
Perché è così che siamo, è l'indole dell'italiano
Vogliamo tutto e bruciamo tutto quello che abbiamo
Mamma, il futuro è lontano
Sono via dall'Italia, sono via da Milano 

Scappa da qui
È un mondo di zombie, senza orizzonti
Scappa da qui

Goodbye to the memories, goodbye to the dream
Didn't know I’d have to find my way back
Can I just let this be?
Goodbye to the memories, goodbye to the dream
Didn't know I’d have to find my way back
Can I just let this be?

Somewhere down the road I guess we took a wrong turn
I took your pictures, lit a match and watch them all burn
I can’t take anymore break ups, or make ups
So straight up, I won’t be there tomorrow when you wake up
But wait up, listen baby girl don’t get it twisted
We gave it all we had, attempted everything to fix it
Another broken heart, I can’t risk it
Girl its plain is simple, we took a shot and we missed it
And now the place I piss in, is where the memories of us are livin'
Down the drain, no more pain
But baby I ain’t kidding, when I tell you that you’ll always have a place in my life
But tonight I’ma make it right
Yeah, I’ma say

[Chorus]

Yeah, I guess I’m back at square 1,
Our love is rare, it’s too bad it wasn’t well done
Yeah we had a good run, never reached the finish line
Wish that we could start again, wish we could go back in time
Wish we could have seen the future, now we’re history
Consistently sending me text, saying that you’re missing me
I’m tryina forget about you, baby girl you’re killing me
And when you hear that last line, you’ll probably be pissed at me
But what can you, girl I’m tryna do me
Clean, slate, fresh start, baby I’m a new me
I promise that you’ll always have a place in my life
But tonight I’ma make it right
Yeah, I’ma say

I won’t never let you go
You ain’t gotta worry ’bout a thing baby

Oh baby can’t you see, you’re the one for me
I won’t never let you go
You ain’t gotta worry ’bout a thing baby
Every single day Ima let you know, oh, oh
You’re my everything

It started back in middle school
Back when it was puppy love
Now it’s so much more than that
It’s something I’ve been dreaming of
It’s crazy looking back, thinking ’bout when we were kids
But it’s funny cause my feelings for you haven’t changed a bit
I remember growing up, looking at my mom and dad
Thinking when I’m older, that’s exactly what I wanna have
And I think I finally found it, ever since the day you came along
I never doubted us, I swear I knew it early on
Baby you my best friend, yeah I hope you know
We’ll go down together just like dominoes
They say there’s no such thing as fairy tales
But this seems to be!
Girl I couldn’t tell you what you mean to me

[Chorus]

Yeah, remember laying on my roof, looking at the stars
I pointed to the biggest one and said that one is ours
You ain’t just a random girl, neah, we go way back
Always doing laps around my mind, like a race track
I been chasing after you ever since I was five foot
Circling your picture with a sharpie in my yearbook
That might of sounded kinda creepy, yeah it’s cheesy, but it’s true girl
I swear that you complete me
Cause you everything I wanted more, never felt like this before
Looking in your eyes sends chills down my spinal cord
I can only ṗray to God you feel the same
Yeah, girl I love you, that will never change

I won’t never let you go
You ain’t gotta worry ’bout a thing baby

Jake Miller,"Wow
Wow, yeah

The other day I got an email, I almost didn't read it
But something caught my eye right before I could delete it
It was bold and underlined, ""Please Read"" was the title
Followed by ""Jake you are my idol""
It said and I quote, my name is Nikki and I used to be dancer
Til the day the doctor diagnosed me with cancer
So I said goodbye to all the hair on my head
And hello to my hospital bed
Yeah see I was just a normal girl, it happened so fast
There were so many days that I thought would be my last
However the fight was tough, and the battle was long
But I felt strong when I listened to your songs
You were, always there for me, you helped my heart beat
You were my only friend, kept you on repeat
I thanks God for you every single night
'Cause believe or not, you saved my life

I've met a million people, been a million places
Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives
I've met a million people, been a million places
Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives

Yeah the mailman knocked said it was for me
Handed me a box, sent from Tennessee
Written on the top ""for jakes eyes only""
Inside was a journal and letter that he wrote me
It said my name is Dillon I'm in 7th grade
I'm ridiculed and picked on almost everyday
Yeah they push me in the halls in between my classes
Yesterday they took my books then broke my glasses
I got no one to talk to, its like I don't exist
Sometimes I wonder if I was gone, would I be missed?
But lemme tell you the real reason for this letter
You've helped me through it all, you've help me feel better
Your words gimme confidence, your messages inspire me
You help me find my inner strength deep inside of me
Through all the bad times, you helped me find the light
Believe or not, you saved my life

I've met a million people, been a million places
Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives
I've met a million people, been a million places
Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives

I was sittin' at my table at dinner the other night
When I noticed a little girl sittin' to my right
She was lookin' at me like she knew me, I guess she did
'Cause then she walked right up to, and then she said
My name is Sami and I swear that I'm your biggest fan
I think she even had my name written on her hand
She said me and my brother used to listen to you every day
Until last year, when he passed away
I'll never forget seein' my parents cry
When they got a call sayin' that your son had died
Man I wish that he was here now, you were his favourite
He had your mixtape and never stopped playin' it
Your music gives me a feelin that I just can't describe
It's like I got my brother back, and he's still alive
I pray for both of you, every single night
'Cause believe or not, you saved my life

I've met a million people, been a million places
Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives
I've met a million people, been a million places
Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives

Now let me turn the table, and talk to you
I had a dream but you're the reason that its comin' true
Yeah I've had some dark days, when the sun don't shine
But you always reminded me that I would be fine
'Cause when no else cared, you believed in my vision
And now I got an army comin' with me on my mission
I thank God for all you, every single night
Cause believe or not, you saved my life",A Million Lives
Jake Miller,"Yeah
I've been away for quite some time now
I think its time I come home
Yeah
And if you ask me, Ill say I'm just fine, but
Deep inside I'm alone
Damn
And I don't know if I can do this much longer
Baby, help me pull through
Trust me
The good life isn't all that good
When I can't even enjoy it with you

[Chorus]
Girl, I can't wait to come home to you
No, I can't wait to come home to you
I just need to see your face
I just need to hear your voice
This whole missin' you thing just won't do
Baby, I need to come home to you
Yeah, I can't wait to come home to you
Wait, you know what?
Screw it girl, I comin' back right now
This whole missin' you thing is now through
See ya soon

I haven't kissed your lips almost six to seven weeks, now
Startin' to feel like amiss
The closest thing I've seen in a smile in a while
Is the smiley face when we text
Girl, I hate to see you cry, and its hard to stay strong
So I'm constantly just tryna pretend
That it doesn't kill me deep inside
When I look into your eyes
Cause I always end up leavin' again

Yeah, but
Now I'm done doin' that
I come and I go, but I'm through with that
No, I'm never gonna leave your side again
So tell me, are you cool with that?
Yeah, ha, me too
Now its just me and you
I love you baby, I'll see ya soon

[Chorus]

Baby, you my everything
Yeah I hope you know it
But when I'm half way across the world
Its hard to show it
Always beggin' me to come home
So that's what I'mma do
Yeah, I'm hoppin' on the first flight out
Ill see ya soon
Baby, you my everything
Yeah I hope you know it
But when I'm half way across the world
Its hard to show it
Always beggin' me to come home
So that's what I'mma do
Yeah, I'm hoppin' on the first flight out

Jake Miller,"Yeah, look
Let me tell you about a kid named Steven
He's slowly running out of things to believe in
Every couple of months his mom leaves him,
For no good reason his step-dad beats him
Not too many friends, only ever had a few of them,
But recently they don't want anything to do with him
Always eating lunch in the bathroom stall,
He just wants to feel normal and be cool again, yeah
Always feeling like the outcast, he's been going crazy ever since his dad passed
He needs guidance and advice but instead
He only has breakdowns and flashbacks of the car crash uh
It's been getting harder everyday, if he was still around everything would be ok
'Cause his dad was always the light at the end of the tunnel,
But now that same damn tunnel is looking dark and grey
He keeps quiet in the back of the class
And when the bell rings Steven hurries home fast
Scared to death the other kids will kick his ass on the long walk home
'Cause its happened in the past so
He's getting used to the black eyes and fat lips
But all he's got is a fake smile and cut wrists
Wishin' he could walk right up to them and show them the scars
And say look you're the reason that I've done this
Maybe they would finally understand and go back to how it was before it all began
But he's just a little different so they taunt him and they beat him
Yeah it's all just fun and games, they don't give a damn, yeah
His older brother ain't around, in and out of jail, hanging with the wrong crowd
He's been doing coke, smoking weed, getting drunk all his life he's a shame
No, he's not too proud
Now his habits are rubbing off on his little bro yeah, but guess what?
Little did he know that every time he did a line,
Every time he lit a joint,
Every time he took a shot he would set the mode
So Steven's sitting in his room getting high now
Doors locked, music up, with his lights out
He just takes another toke til his room fills with smoke
5-6-7 hours til he knocks out
Now he started stealing pills from his mom
8-9-10 at a time and now they're gone
And maybe for a moment all his problems seem to fade,
But the high fades too after not too long
And that's when it really sinks in and that's when it hits him
That these god damn drugs won't fix him
Curled up on the floor, can't take it anymore
Now he's talking to God 'cause he's the only one that gets him
On his knees, looking up, can't stop crying
""God I know we haven't talked in a long time
But this time I really need you. Please God help me, say something
Just give me a sign, because now I'm falling apart and
I don't think that I can do it. Please God, give me the strength
To pull through it. Tell me, Should I give up? I could end it all right now.
I just don't know if I'm brave enough to do it.
'Cause there's gotta be a better way than suicide.
Try to wait it out, give it time, you'll be fine.
But it's been so long and I still haven't been able to get rid
Of all the thoughts that I feel inside. So sick, so angry, so mad
And to top it off no one even knows that""
That's when he stood up, wiped his tears, walked over to his desk
And got a pen and a notepad
He just couldn't see it getting any better
So on a cold dark night in December, Steven knew exactly what he had to do
But first he sat down and wrote a couple letters
One to his step-dad, one to his mother,
Couple to the kids at school, one to his brother
Bringing them the pain that they once brought him
Tear drops on the paper one after another
Yeah, I hope that you all feel guilty.
'Cause I'm broken now and you can't heal me
And now you're all an accomplice in murder
Each and every one of you have chipped in to kill me
So the reason that I'm writing you this evening,
Is to say goodbye and to tell you that I'm leaving
But don't hold your breath 'cause I ain't never coming back
Sincerely yours, Steven",Steven
Jake Miller,"The used to say I'd never make it
And that's the reason that I will

Jake Miller,"I been on my grind for a while now
I got my top down, music loud, ridin' round
Feel like I'm in heaven
I feel like I'm in heaven

So if you feelin' how I'm feelin' come and ride along
You can find me in the sky with a smile on
Feel like I'm in heaven
I feel like I'm in heaven

Yea, see I got one time and never gave up
No time to sleep and I stayed up
Leavin' niggas in the dust like wait up
Throwin' money in the air, we paid up
I'm self-made since 5th grade
Yea, every night, man I prayed for this
I grabbed life by the goddamn balls
Always knew that I was made for this
Well this is all so strange
Been twice and my whole life changed
Gotta take advance and I shit my pants
Now I'm ridin' round in my Range
See I never stop, never back down
I got big dreams in a small town
I fly in the world but perform for the night
Took it back so goodnight then I'm homebound
Woo, woo, see that's how we roll
Round and around and around we go
Just tour the country, just signed a deal
And I ain't even 21 years old
I swear to God I waited my whole life to say this
But I leave at that, after all this time
I'm startin' to feel like I made it
Feels like I got the world in my pocket
Sometimes I think I'm dreamin
Yea, I got it in the bag, I ain't sayin' nothing bad
But it's time to give us something to believe in
Man this shit's too good to be true
The top is where we headed
I swear I think I'm bout to go to heaven
'Cause now I'm singing

I been on my grind for a while now
I got my top down, music loud, ridin' round
Feel like I'm in heaven
I feel like I'm in heaven

So if you feelin' how I'm feelin' come and ride along
You can find me in the sky with a smile on
Feel like I'm in heaven
I feel like I'm in heaven

Yea, I threw my old life out the window, snap back on my team rolls
Y'all set the bar high and my girls get low
Ain't talkin' about no limbo
Got a scholarship but I turned it down
Not to give and I earned it now
I'm makin' a killin, step in the building
Flow so hard that I burn it down
I'm makin' it rain' and I'm pourin' it up
I dreamed about it every night growing up
Still the way down the bikini bottom
Now I'm blowin' up like I miss this puff
Then she screamin' my name so loud
Been to school, mama wasn't so proud
Two years later runnin' round stage on her birthday
with another sold out crowd
I see you climb in the back of the shows now
Singing along to my songs
Tears of joy 'cause your little boy is right where he belongs
They say you miss the shots you don't take
Well I guess I made it in
Guess I'm doin' what I love and I'm troubling the world
At a time I don't even know what coulda been
So I dedicate this song to the kids that were just like me
Anybody who's been talkin' good enough
Anybody out there with a dream
'Cause I'm still standin' tall after the million times that I've fell
But I guess sometimes you get to heaven
First you gotta go through hell, I'm singin'

I been on my grind for a while now
I got my top down, music loud, ridin' round
Feel like I'm in heaven
I feel like I'm in heaven

So if you feelin' how I'm feelin' come and ride along
You can find me in the sky with a smile on

I tried to knock
'Cause you changed the locks
Now I'm all alone
Where am I supposed to go?
If you are where my home is
I guess that makes me homeless

So what now? I got no idea where I'm goin'
I'm lost with no direction like my GPS is broken
I'm walkin' round the streets thinkin' bout you every night
I'm feelin' homeless now
Lookin' like the man from I'm Alright
See I just wanna come back home, can't do this on my own
You were the only thing I knew for sure, guess that I was wrong
See I've tried to walk away but I just end up at your doorstep
Waiting for my phone to ring but nope, you haven't called yet
So I'm wandering, homelessly
Wish that you stayed with me
Thought that we were meant to be
Felt that you were there for me
But I guess not 'cause in case you failed to notice
You used to be my home until you left me homeless

If you are where my home is

So what now? It used to be just you and me
But you kicked me out, locked the doors and tossed away the keys
Put me outside lookin' in,
You would think that I'm just flyin'
But I'm a bigger wreck than the Titanic inside
I'm slippin' on sidewalks, I'm following street signs
I need some help, I'm feelin' stranded, losin' my damn mind
I'm blindfolded by you, girl you took everything that I own
I keep callin' your phone but all I get is the tone
So I'm lookin' up at the stars, these street lights they got me
I never planned on living life without you here right beside me
But guess I was wrong, 'cause in case you failed to notice
You used to be my home until you left me homeless

Here I stand in the cold
I tried to knock

Yea that's good and all but that just means another civil war
between me and my girl
What am I supposed to say?
Hey baby, how you doin'? I missed you home
By the way I'm bout to leave, ah good
I'm going on a fall tour
But I'll be back before you know it, then I'm all yours
Listen Jake, she'll understand, this is more important
Oh really? You wanna tell her that?
'Cause if I ever did she'd probably kill me
Look I'm sorry Jake but it's done deal, you're leavin' Thursday
And you'll be on the road during Christmas and your birthday
Great, my girl's mad 'cause I ain't there a lot
And now I gotta spend my birthday in the courtyard Mary at
Drinkin' up your stress man, you've had a busy year
But this is what you sound good for, this is your career
This ain't a shooting for the weak hearted, Jake I thought you knew
But you're canvassing your dream and having all my life through
If you ain't ready tell me now, I never said that it was easy
Otherwise I'll be in my office, you know where to reach me

Look, hang up with my agent, put my phone down on the table
Five seconds later get a call from my label
Like hey Jake, how you doin'? Tell me how's the album comin'?
We heard your last song and honestly we didn't love it
We don't think it'll make the cut, could've written better verses
Deadline's in a month and now we startin' to get nervous
Stop getting so distracted, start pickin' up the pen
You need more time in the studio, and les time with your friends
'Cause it's crunch time, should be doing nothing but making music
We follow you on Instagram, see everything you doin'
Yea we see you at the beach, at the gym, at the mall
To be honest, doesn't seem like you're working hard at all
A day later I don't even have time to take a shit
I've been working non-stop and I'll be honest, I admit
Sometimes I need a break, this life can drive a man crazy
Especially when your label keeps callin' sayin' you're lazy
Listen Jake, I know it's hard
Sometimes it isn't fun
But if this album tanks, well your career could be done
If you ain't ready tell us now, never said that it was easy

Gave me a kiss, then turned around and stole the keys to my whip
Aw man, what a selfish bitch

Let's have a moment of silence for what I say next

Only cared about her Instagram captions

Go find a douchebag, maybe he'll be right for ya

Yea, it feels so good the way you bring out the bad in me

And a honky tonk queen's the last thing I need.
Just set me up with your best whiskey.
This is just between the bottle and me.

I don't want to talk. I don't need a friend.
Don't think I stuttered when I said
I'm here to deal with a memory.

Jake Owen,"Well I said hey girl what's your name?
Haven't I seen you before?
I recognized them dark green eyes when you came through the door
Are you alone or are you with someone?
She said a matter of fact I'm not
So I took her hand that's when it all began and we headed towards the parking lot

And she said hey boy, do you mind takin' me home tonight?
'Cause I ain't never seen a country boy with tires on his truck this
High I said climb on up but honey watch the cup
I've been spitting my dip inside and hold on tight
'Cause its gonna be wilder than any eight second ride

We went riding round rocking to the sound of ""Country Boy Can Survive""
And I knew then that she was my kind of girl 'cause she was singing every single line
Then she slid on over put my hand on her
Shoulder and I asked her what she wanted to do
She said it (really) don't matter where we go just as long as I'm riding with you

And she said hey boy, do you mind takin' me home tonight?
'Cause I ain't never seen a country boy with tires on his truck this
High I said climb on up but honey watch the cup
I've been spitting my dip inside and hold on tight
'Cause its gonna be wilder than any eight second ride

So we headed out to old tobacco road
Put the tailgate down and we made love
She said true country boys hard to find but I found one wilder than any eight second ride

And she said hey boy, do you mind taking me home tonight?
'Cause I ain't never seen a country boy with tires on his truck this
High I said climb on up but watch the cup that I spit my dip inside
And hold on tight 'cause its gonna be wilder than any eight second ride
Yea hold on tight 'cause its gonna be wilder than any eight second ride",Eight Second Ride
Jake Owen,"He said he had to stop
He hadn't had a drop of anything
Stronger than coffee
In ten months, three weeks
And one long day

He pushed away his plate
Said it's better late than never done
When it comes to getting right
It took a while but I saw the light

He said some things that cast long shadows
That I never will out run
And every day I spend living

With ghosts of all the things that I've done wrong
Grab a chair 'cause the list is long
I can write you a country song
About the reasons I'll be going home
To a house full of memories
Things I wish I'd done differently
And when I'm feeling weak they keep me strong
Ghosts of all the things that I've done wrong

He said there's a spot of paint
And it just ain't the right shade
But it covers up the hole I made
Where I broke my wrist the night she left
And there's a lot of friends
That I ain't seen in a lot of years
But some are still hanging around
In old pictures I can't take down

He said some things that cast long shadows
That I never will out run
And every day I do battle

There wasn't anything or anyone that I couldn't leave behind,
I could always find a getaway from what I' was hiding from,
It's looking like I've run out of places to run.

Everywhere I go, and everything I do,
There ain't a corner that I turn that ain't one big,

And then she smiled at me

Jake Owen,"I had a one night stand with my best friend's baby sister
And to this day he still won't speak to me
I pawned my grandpa's old guitar in college
For a case of beer and a tank of gasoline
I took a swing at my old man one Christmas
I never dreamed that it would be his last
I wish mom had rung my neck
When she caught me with those cigarettes
Which reminds me, I'm down to my last pack

If I had a dime
For half the things I did
That didn't make no sense at all
I'd be living a little higher on the hog
If only I'd have known
That later on down the road
I'd look back and not like what I see
I'd have changed a lot of things
Startin' with me

I called my brother everything I could think of
The night he wouldn't bail me out of jail
I lost a job most folks 'round here would die for
By laying out all night and raising hell
And I let a woman that I love slip through my fingers
Chalk another dumb move up to my foolish pride
I wasn't there standin' by the bed
When the preacher bowed his head
With the family the day my grandma died

If I had a dime
For half the things I did
That didn't make no sense at all
I'd be living a little higher on the hog
If only I'd have known

And I was feeling every bit of my side of the tracks
But she took care of that, when she pulled out that moon shine

Tasted like an apple pie
We were wishing and kissing and sipping that stuff
Sho' nuff messing me up
Till I couldn't tell the moonlight, from the stars in her eyes
I never felt so fine caught up in a good time between her
And that apple pie moonshine

Well we were dancing around in the high beams
Her hands in the back pockets of my jeans
The radio playing the perfect song
I still think about her every time the thing comes on
And I never forget that first kiss
When a country boy got to hold a real princess I can still taste the cinnamon on her lips
Every time I reminisce

Its sweeter than moonshine tasting like an apple pie
We were wishing and kissing and sipping that stuff
Sho' nuff messing me up
Till I couldn't tell the moonlight, from the stars in her eyes
I never felt so fine caught up in a good time between her +
And that apple pie moonshine

Yeah I couldn't tell the moonlight, from the stars in her eyes
I never felt so fine caught up in a good time
Between her and that apple pie moonshine

Jake Owen,"There's a place that they call Heaven
Just south of town way up on a hill
They say you can see for miles
When the sun goes down, time stands still

No I've never been up to Heaven
But I've always wanted to go
It's ten miles down highway eleven
And ten more minutes up the old dirt road

Well hey baby I was hoping
Maybe you'd feel like taking a drive
'Cause I can take you on a trip to Heaven
And have you back by tonight

Well there's a store on the way to Heaven
They oughta have everything we need
A bag of ice, a six pack of something
And a few dollars worth of gasoline

Well hey baby I was hoping
Maybe you'd feel like taking a drive
'Cause I can take you on a trip to Heaven
And have you back by tonight

Oh I've heard that it's perfect
So what do you say we see if they're right
Well I can take you on a trip to Heaven
And have you back by tonight

Well hey baby I was hoping
Maybe you'd feel like taking a drive

Jake Owen,"He was old school and overalls
Tough as nails as I recall
He fought a war and came back home
Honest as the day was long
And right before my grandpa died 
He looked me right straight in the eyes
Said here's some words to get you by
To help you on the journey of your life

You'll need a hero
And a good dog
Especially a good dog
A hammer and a handsaw
A band-aid now and then
You'll need a home to come home to
Son we all need a refuge
On the straight and narrow path
You need to learn to bend
Get a good square keep it level
Have grace to face the devil
You'll need an angel flying by your side
On the journey of your life

Ride the wind 'til we meet again
On the other side of life
You'll need some good luck and a Bible
Especially a Bible
A lot of faith in God above
And a woman you can love
You'll need a good song that you can sing on
And a shoulder you can lean on
And you gotta draw the line sometimes when push comes to shove
You'll need to lose some to be a winner
And have courage to surrender
You'll need to laugh a lot and keep it light
On the journey of your life

And no matter what dreams you're chasing
Never get above your raising
And may the simple things be amazing
On the journey of your life

He said I'll be the angel flying by your side
On the journey of your life",The Journey of Your Life
Jake Owen,"The bartender said ya'll keep it down
The party was goin' strong
By the palm trees down at the tiki bar
Right there in the Holidome
We'd been sittin' there since happy hour
Had the day off in Omaha
And all those girls came in and they wanted to swim
And the clothes they started comin' off.

[Chorus]
And it was alright, alright.
We just got carried away
Yeah it was alright, alright
Nobody feelin' no pain

Well two a.m. room 509
We were all still good to go
Well damn near blew the speaker out
Of that alarm clock radio.
The hotel security man
Kept knockin' til his knuckles turned red
While all those Daisy Duke country girls
They were dancin' on the king-sized bed

[Chorus]

Alright I gotta know.
How many of ya'll ever been out there in the hotel before
When they close that old pool bar down.
Now I know ya'll just didn't go on back up to your room
And turn on QVC and order out for pizza
What you probably did was go down to that old icemaker
Down there in the hallway and start fillin' up that bathtub
In your room with as much ice and as much liquid
Refreshments as it would possibly hold
And pretty soon you got a big ol' party goin' on, and you know

No whistle, no foul, no real harm done.
We might've messed up a motel room
But we sure 'nough had some fun.

My little sandy town
She spent the summer there
A couple houses down
Well it was magic in the air
When she caught my eye
We shared three short months
And one long goodbye

She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay
She was the one that got away
Yeah, the one that got away

Well she kissed my lips
Down on Ocean Drive
She set my world on fire
On the fourth of July
We wrote our names in the sand
Under the star-soaked sky
But it washed away like she did
With the rising tide

She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay
She was the one that got away

I'm looking over my shoulder
Wishing I could see her face
Wishing I could hold her

That horizon had a haunting glow
I could see those heat waves rising off the ground
We were sittin' on go at that old stop sign
Headlights shinin' on the county line
It was do or die, had to get out of that town
Well honey, you said run
We were so young

Tryin' to the world on fire
Turn the key and spark the wire
Chasin' down a feelin', runnin' on desire
The future was an open road
Gone in a cloud of smoke
Leavin' a trail of flames behind those tires
Just you and me girl, settin' the world on fire

Yeah, we were settin' the world on fire

We were blazin' down the road like Kerouac
No time to stop and cover our tracks
We were too damn hot for any one town to hold
Yeah, we burned through a few good years
Then you started looking back in that rear view mirror
Right outside of Reno the trail got cold
You said you'd had enough of this ramblin' love

Tryin' to the world on fire
Turn the key and spark the wire
Chasin' down a feelin', runnin' on desire
The future was an open road
Gone in a cloud of smoke

For a while there girl, we were settin' the world on fire

Pullin' on a Lucky Strike 'bout to head west
Ridin' off into God's sunset

But honey you know me, I'll always be

Girl you know they didn’t ride
So come on over tonight

I’m gonna rock you like Zeppelin, roll you like the stones
Burr like them speakers in my old headphones
Gonna fly like an eagle when I drop a needle on the blues
I’m gonna get the metal piece down from the attic
With a pop and a hiss and a little bit of static
We’ll be chillin' like a villain on some Dylan while we’re killin' some booze
We’re gonna kick it like the kids did in 1972

So will it just be me and you
Playing air drums with The Who’s Keith Moon
You know them good ones always die too soon
Like Jimmy, Jim and Joplin

Yea, kickin back, cutting loose
Sippin on Jack, that’s what we do

Like a bullet and it's hard to breath,
One little kiss never killed nobody, but me.

Ain't goin' out, ain't getting drunk
Don't need a shot to get messed up
I'm thumbing through pictures of you replaying our last night
Thought I'd be fine to see you one more time, yea right

One little kiss never killed nobody,
One little drink never wrecked no party.
Thought we were over baby, but you kept getting closer baby.
One little touch never broke no heart girl,
But I always wanna finish what you start girl.
Now your gone and it's hitting me,
Like a bullet and it's hard to breath,
One little kiss never killed nobody, but me.

Right here, they said I never would have listened when you whispered in my ear,
Last night when you said ""Baby it's alright""

One little kiss never killed nobody,
One little drink never wrecked no party.
Thought we were over baby, but you kept getting closer baby.
One little touch never broke no heart girl,

Jake Owen,"I’ve always had a thing for girls that dance
When they get a little tipsy
Corona cold in your hand, your brushed back hair
I took another sip of whiskey
And I didn’t let the ice cubes melt in the bottom of my plastic cup

And I said hey pretty girl you wanna get out of here?
And you looked up
Looking in your big blue eyes
Laying there that night

I said this sure feels dangerous to me
It feels like a struck match kissing gasoline
It feels a little better than it ever has
It sure feels good, baby let’s be bad
I feel your heart, I feel you there
I feel a little brave, I feel a little scared tonight
But it sure feels right

Well the sunrise hit the window
And there you were
In my Alabama t-shirt
I fly where angels sleep like a dream
You got me thinking ‘bout those 3 words
And I didn’t sneak off like I done so many times before

And you opened up your eyes and gave me a kiss
I said give me one more
And in those twisted covers
We were more than lovers

And you said this sure feels dangerous to me
It feels like a struck match kissing gasoline
It feels a little better than it ever has
It sure feels good, baby let’s be bad
I feel your heart, I feel you there
I feel a little brave, I feel a little scared in the morning light
And it sure feels right

It sure feels right

It sure feels dangerous to me
It feels like a struck match kissing gasoline
It feels a little better than it ever has
It sure feels good, baby let’s be bad
I feel your heart, I feel you there
I feel a little brave, I feel a little scared tonight
And it sure feels right

And it sure feels right
And it sure feels right
And it sure feels right

Live big wide when we go out tonight
And relive that time
Corona cold in your hand, your brushed back hair
I’ll sip on my whiskey
You know I always had a thing for girls that dance
When they get a little tipsy",Sure Feels Right

It’s a kiddy pool and a hose, kinda think we need ice

Solos, toyos
Lift em up

I need a tall glass of something nice and strong
A little liquor and a loving to do all night long
I need a kick in the chest, a shot to the lips
A little hot, make this martini shake your hips
I said tequila, margarita, senorita please
Chase it down with a Corona and some sex on the beach
A yellow umbrella foamy style, a kiss on my cheek

Beers ice cold and got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer, and that sun shining down

Gotta hop on the old dirt road

Sweat on you back stickin to the seats

They roll the sidewalks up around here
It's just kids and the cops out after seven o'clock
So you better had already bought your beer
You cut your headlights off trying to not get caught
She's out the window and across the yard
She slid it into the seat, slow rolled it down the street
'Til you parked it and the stereo starts
And they say

Nothing good ever happens after midnight
Maybe midnight's just misunderstood
'Cause if nothing good ever happens after midnight
Why does it always feel so damn good
Wrapped up so tight with me, no light
All night, it was alright, alright

You go as fast as you can, go as far as you want
With nobody out to slow you down
She was your rearview queen, you were her ghost street king
While everybody was asleep in the town
You watch the relights blink 'til the horizon's pink
All while her daddy thinks she's still in her bed
But when you're young and dumb
The only rule of thumb was do the opposite of everything
And they said, and they said

Nothing good ever happens after midnight
Maybe midnight's just misunderstood
'Cause if nothing good ever happens after midnight
Why does it always feel so damn good
Wrapped up so tight, your own paradise

We were living it up, up, up in that American love

We were naming all the stars up in that sky
And I named the brightest one right after her

With her leaning all up real close to me
And with a six pack, the next thing I knew, we were in the backseat, you know
