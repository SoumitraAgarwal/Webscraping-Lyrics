Samuel,"Amiga mía, lo sé, sólo vives por él
Que lo sabe también, pero él no te ve
Como yo, suplicarte a mi boca que diga
Que me confesado entre copas
Que es con tu piel con quien sueña de noche
Y que enloqueces con cada botón que
Te desabrochas pensando en su manos
Él no te ha visto temblar, esperando
Una palabra, algún gesto un abrazo
Él no te ve como yo suspirando
Con los ojitos abiertos de par en par
Escucharme nombrarle.
!Ay, amiga mía! lo sé y él también

Amiga mía, no sé qué decir
Ni qué hacer para verte feliz
Ojala pudiera mandar en el alma o en la libertad
Que es lo que a él le haré falta
Llenarte los bolsillos de guerras ganadas
De sueños e ilusiones renovadas
Yo quiero regalarte una poesía
Tú piensas que estoy dando las noticias

Amiga mía, ojala algún día escuchando mi canción
De pronto, entiendas que nunca quise fue contar tu historia
Porque pudiera resultar conmovedora
Pero, perdona, amiga mía
No es inteligencia mi sabiduría
Esta es mi manera de decir las cosas
No es que sea mi trabajo, es que es mi idioma

Amiga mía, princesa de un cuento infinito
Amiga mía, tan sólo pretendo que cuentes conmigo
Amiga mía, a ver si uno de estos días
Por fin aprendo a hablar
Sin tener que dar tantos rodeos
Que toda esta historia me importa
Porque eres mi amiga

Amiga mía, lo sé, sólo vives por él
Que lo sabe también, pero él no te ve
Como yo, suplicarte a mi boca que diga
Que me confesado entre copas
Que es con tu piel con quien sueña de noche 

Amiga mía, no sé qué decir
Ni qué hacer para verte feliz
Ojalá pudiera mandar en el alma o en la libertad
Que es lo que a él le haré falta
Llenarte los bolsillos de guerras ganadas
De sueños e ilusiones renovadas
Yo quiero regalarte una poesía
Tú piensas que estoy dando las noticias

Amiga mía, tan sólo prentendo que cuentes conmigo

Samuel,"Sé que hay en tus ojos con solo mirar 
Que estas cansado de andar y de andar
Y caminar girando siempre en un lugar

Sé que las ventanas se pueden abrir
Cambiar el aire depende de ti
Te ayudara vale la pena una vez más

Saber que se puede querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Es mejor perderse que nunca embarcar
Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar
Aunque ya ves que no es tan fácil empezar

Sé que lo imposible se puede lograr
Que la tristeza algún día se irá
Y así­ será la vida cambia y cambiará

Sentirás que el alma vuela
Por cantar una vez más

Saber que se puede querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Saber que se puede querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Vale más poder brillar
Que solo buscar ver el sol

Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro con el corazón

Saber que se puede querer que se pueda
Pintarse la cara color esperanza
Tentar al futuro con el corazón",Color Esperanza
Samuel,"Nunca imagine la vida sin ti
Todo lo q me plantie, siempre estabas tu
Solo tu sabes bien quien soy
De donde vengo y a donde voy
Nunca t he mentido nunca t he escondido nada
Siempre me tuviste cuando me necesitabas
Nadie mejor q tu sabra
Q di todo lo q pude dar

Y ahora y tu t vas
Asi como si nada (y tu t vas)
Acortandome la vida,agachando la mirada
Y tu t vas
Y yo, q me pierdo entre la nada (y tu t vas)
Donde quedan las palabras
Y el amor q me jurabas, y tu t vas, ooh, oh

Si es q t he fallado dime como y cuando a sido
Si es q t has cansado y ahora me hechas al olvido
No habra nadie q t amara
Asi como yo t puedo amar

Por mas mas q busco no encuentro razon
Por mas q intento no puedo olvidar
Eres como una llama q arde en el fondo de mi corazon",Y Tu Te Vas

Samuel Joseph,"Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him to listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing, singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

He was strumming my pain, yeah, he was singing my life
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 
With his song",Killing Me Softly
Samuel Ramey,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine [From Jubilee]
Samuel Ramey,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You [From Girl Crazy]
Samuel Ramey,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?
Ain't she nice? Look her over once or twice.

Samuele Bersani,"C'è un quaderno che nascondo
Ma non ho mai scritto cosa sei per me
Perchè è facile
Tu mi leggi dentro io no
Se gli errori li cancello
Resta la peggior calligrafia
Che ho avuto in vita mia
Nuda lì sul foglio
Io sono un pescatore di asterischi
Sotto un'onda a forma di parentesi
Rotonda che mi porta via
Non si può partecipare
Subito a un concorso di poesia
Che idea intitolarlo apnea

In questo gioco di pensieri sporchi
Sopra un letto prima di abbracciarti
Mi connetto e penso insieme a te
I tuoi capelli neri a
Punta d’inchiostro
Si aggrovigliano ai miei
Io polipo tu seppia
Non vuoi farti mangiare però
Nella vita c'è sempre un però
Un cielo che si appoggia sul mare
E tu impari chi sei
Come giocolieri esperti
Tutto il tempo a cercare
Il senso gravitazionale che non c'è
E c'è un grillo che nascondo
Ogni tanto esce e dice che chissà
Chissà se anche lei
È pura fino in fondo
In questo gioco di pensieri sporchi
Sopra un letto prima di abbracciarti
Mi connetto più vicino a te
E tu sei bella come quella madonna
Che un giorno qualcuno pescò
Anche il polipo e la seppia
Non si fanno più male e no
Son saliti a guardare

Laggiù dove sono gli dei

Samuele Bersani,"Ultimamente sei tu a decidere la strada 
Io resto dietro di te 
Raccolgo I sassi rotondi in una scatola quadrata, ho un passatempo inutile 
Sinceramente da un po' si vive alla giornata 
Non posso dire di no 
Usciamo fuori dal quartiere una volta al mese solo di sabato 
Ma pensa che coincidenza
Chiedi un autografo all'assassino 
Guarda il colpevole da vicino 
E approfitta finché resta dov'è
Toccagli la gamba fagli una domanda 
Cattiva, spietata 
Con il foro di entrata, senza visto di uscita 
È stato lui, io lo so 
Non credo alla campana degli 
Innocentisti perchè 
Anticamente ero io un centurione con la spada e non lo posso difendere 
Mi ricordo quando ci fu Galileo e Giovanna D'Arco 
Ero presente in piazza 
Provavo immenso piacere 
Mi sentivo bene a vedere come si muore 
Sono di un'altra razza 
Chiedi un autografo all'assassino 
Guarda il colpevole da vicino 
E approfitta finchè resta dov'è 
Toccagli la gamba fagli una domanda, ancora 
Chiedi un autografo all'assassino 
Chiedigli il poster e l'adesivo 
E approfitta finché resta dov'è 
Toccagli la gamba 
Fagli una domanda

Spietata 
È la mia curiosità impregnata 
Di pioggia televisiva 
Comincia un'altra partita",Cattiva
Samuele Bersani,"Ciao ciao ai tuoi orecchini 
Con il simbolo della pace 
Te li ho comprati io d'estate 
Al mercatino dei freak
Non mi hai nemmeno detto grazie 
Ma ti sei fermata lì a ballare
Dimmi dell'India
Hai più pensato a quel progetto 
Di esportare la piadina romagnola? 
Facciamo dopo il diploma? 
Magari, sì è meglio, ma intanto mi fermo 
Un po' qui 
Tiriamo fuori tutti I tuoi cd? 
Ok, so già che metterai su I Doors, oh no 
Metti il Bolero
Slega il movimento, il pensiero
Più sesso 
Ohi ohi come ti arrabbi 
Se il filo non ti va bene 
Per fare le collanine
Ma mi è venuta un idea
Potrei provare adesso io a infilarmi 
Dentro a tutte le perline 
Gli anni Settanta 
Avrei lasciato tutto per seguire un corso 
Di campana tibetana 
Con il mio cane e l'amaca
Dormendo sospeso a due stelle nel cielo 
Ma qui 
Trovami un posto per rifarlo qui 
In un recinto chiuso non ci sto, oh no 
Né con la destra, ma nemmeno col P.C.I. 
Che bestia, che bestia 

Ciao ciao belle tettine 
Scusami se parlo male 
Lo sai che io non sono fine 
Ma parlo come mi viene 
Libero da ogni chiave, 
Via I lucchetti e le catene!

Samuele Bersani,"Le mie parole sono sassi 
Precisi aguzzi pronti da scagliare 
Su facce vulnerabili e indifese 
Sono nuvole sospese 
Gonfie di sottointesi 
Che accendono negli occhi infinite attese 
Sono gocce preziose indimenticate 
A lungo spasimate e poi centellinate, sono frecce infuocate che il vento o la fortuna sanno indirizzare 
Sono lampi dentro a un pozzo, cupo e abbandonato 
Un viso sordo e muto che l'amore ha illuminato 
Sono foglie cadute 
Promesse dovute 
Che il tempo ti perdoni per averle pronunciate 
Sono note stonate 
Sul foglio capitate per sbaglio 
Tracciate e poi dimenticate 
Le parole che ho detto, oppure ho creduto di dire 
Lo ammetto 
Strette tra i denti 
Passate, ricorrenti 
Inaspettate, sentite o sognate
Le mie parole son capriole 
Palle di neve al sole 
Razzi incandescenti prima di scoppiare 
Sono giocattoli e zanzare, sabbia da ammucchiare 
Piccoli divieti a cui disobbedire 
Sono andate a dormire sorprese da un dolore profondo 
Che non mi riesce di spiegare 
Fanno come gli pare 
Si perdono al buio per poi ritornare 
Sono notti interminate, scoppi di risate 
Facce sopraesposte per il troppo sole 
Sono questo le parole 
Dolci o rancorose 
Piene di rispetto oppure indecorose 
Sono mio padre e mia madre 
Un bacio a testa prima del sonno 
Un altro prima di partire 
Le parole che ho detto e chissà quante ancora devono venire
Strette tra i denti 
Risparmiano i presenti 
Immaginate, sentite o sognate 
Spade, fendenti 
Al buio sospirate, perdonate 
Da un palmo soffiate",Le Mie Parole
Samuele Bersani,"Dentro al replay 
Fra miliardi di altri ci sei

Ti vedo

Qualcosa ho cancellato 
Si è fermato il tempo, la sua regolarità

È cominciata l'eclissi 

Cadono le stelle 
Allora è vero 
E io non so se ci sarò 
Dove andrò 
Non lo so se lo merito o no 
Se correggerò gli effetti dei miei guasti nucleari 
Se troverò il coraggio ti telefono domani 
E più sarò lontano e più sarò da te 
Dimenticato e muto 
Come uno che non c'è 
Tornerò, tornerò davvero 
A sentire su di me profumo delle mani 
Di notte io farò sogni tridimensionali 
Senza chiedere mai niente al mondo 
Neanche a te 
Senza chiedermi perché

E poi non mi parlarmi adesso della tua claustrofobia

e li ritrovi perch?? li hai nascosti male
Davanti c'?? una lunga fila di ricordi
certi rospi vomitati sulle scale
serrature arrugginite di cancelli storti che si chiudono
e impediscono di andare
Fanno stare giorni interi a contemplare un muro come
un dopo incantesimo sbagliato
mentre un uomo chiede aiuto e grida forte da un imbuto
la mia faccia ?? gi?? caduta nel gelato
E quando cambio faccia e sono triste
vorrei essere Maciste
con due dita sollevare un toro
sradicare le colonne che mi tengono in catene
con la forza sovraumana del pensiero
liberare i pensionati alle sbarre l?? affacciati
che ogni estate mi ritrovano in tv
fra proclami e televendite
appassiscono di repliche anche i fiori stati sempre sui balconi
E quando cambio faccia e sono triste
vorrei essere Maciste
cuore grande cuore generoso
sopravvivere ai giganti che mi lanciano i macigni
in un mondo meno viscido e schifoso
liberare i carcerati dagli sbagli e dai reati
tutti quelli che di colpe non ne han pi??
fra prelati e calciatori
appassiscono anche i fiori aiutati dalla pioggia
a stare su
liberare i carcerati dagli sbagli e dai reati
tutti quelli che di colpe non ne han pi??
fra prelati e calciatori
appassiscono anche i fiori aiutati dalla pioggia a stare su

Da un analista logorroico 
Che mi privava dei commenti

Ma così mai prima

Guadrdavo il mondo dagli specchi 
Che ripetevano I miei sbagli

Ho una via d'uscita

C'è poca pioggia e sto aspettando un fuoco 
Una scintilla che mi accenda nella cenere 
Un'alba in questo buio cieco

A volte io ho ancora paura di chi sia solo una mia immagine

Alla chitarra ho messo corde nuove 
Uscite fuori come code di lucertole

Aspettando segni di onestà
E di risveglio, e come va?
Non va un po' meglio?

Cerchi olimpici di vino rosso
E una formica pietrificata del secolo scorso

Spirali ipnotiche a matita in alto
E poche righe sopravvissute a un pennarello giallo

Doch sie wollten halt auf sich und auf ihr Leben scheißen Liedertext
Wir haben gelernt, dass wir niemand trauen können 
Doch ab und zu lernten wir ein paar prima Frauen kennen Alle
Merkten in diesem Leben wird man niemals auslernen 
Ihr könnt die Frustration aus meinen Liedern raushören Samy
Und seitdem rauchen wir Dope und saufen 
Und zwar ohne Pausen, haben rote Augen Deluxe
Viele behaupten, dass wir komisch drauf sind 
Aber wir sind bloß verzweifelt weil wir Kohle brauchen Generation
Wir waren noch nie bekannt für gutes Benehmen 
Eher dafür so selten wie möglich zur Schule zu gehen Songtexte
Bei der Imbissbude zu stehen und Buder zu drehen 
Uns kann keiner umerziehen, wir sind zu souverän Songtext

Denn das ist meine Generation, zu viel Leute meiner Generation Lyrics
Ham keine Motivation und Inspiration 
Sind immer besoffen und immer nur stoned Lyric

Hört gut zu was ich sag 

Denn das ist meine Generation, zu viel Leute meiner Generation Liedertexte
Ham keine Motivation und Inspiration 
Schufften sich tot für`n Minimumlohn Liedertext

Könnt ihr mich fühl`n 

Wir haben keinen Bock Bossen denn Arsch zu küssen Alle
Wir haben Bock relaxed zu leben, den ganzen Tag zu kiffen Samy
Kein Bock dem Staat zu dienen, mehr Bock den Staat zu dissen Deluxe
Indem wir Wände beschmieren, auf die Straßen pissen Generation
Und scheiß auf Politik, wir gehen nicht wählen Songtexte
Weil es scheint als ob unsere Stimmen eh nicht zählen Songtext
Egal was es ist wir sind stets dagegen 
Sogar der Sonnenschein ist schon krebserregend Lyrics
Uns kommt es vor als wären wir im Krieg geboren wären Lyric
Als ob wir für die da oben niedere Formen wären Liedertexte
Viele wünschen sich, dass sie nie geboren wären Liedertext
Stellen sich vor, wie es wäre wenn sie nicht hier geboren wären Alle
Und deshalb müssen wir zu Drogen greifen 
Weil wir uns vor Angst vom Alltag in die Hose scheißen Samy
Deshalb muss ich`s in die Strophen schreiben 
Und ich weiß ihr werdet es lieben weil die Flows so tight sind Deluxe
Wir alle sehen uns nach einem guten Leben 
Aber Viele hier haben zu viel Angst es zuzugeben Generation
Und deshalb komme ich, um ihnen Mut zu geben 
Um meinen Leuten gut zuzureden Songtexte
Meine Generation 

Denn das ist meine Generation, zu viel Leute meiner Generation Songtext
Ham keine Motivation und Inspiration 
Sind immer besoffen und immer nur stoned Lyrics

Ihr wisst genau wen ich mein 

Denn das ist meine Generation, zu viel Leute meiner Generation Lyric

Werden nicht satt von Kinderportionen 

Hört gut zu wenn ich sag Liedertexte

Das hier ist meine Generation 
Alle Leute meiner Generation 
Immer besoffen und immer nur stoned Liedertext
Werden nicht satt von euern Kinderportionen 
Wir brauchen Inspiration

Ich wär? so gern dein Superheld
Mh yeeeey

Denn viele Leute können sich nicht vorstellen
Und wissen nicht was es heißt,
Wenn dein Sohn neben dir I'm Bett liegt
Und dir sagt er wär? gerne weiß.
Und do weißt, alle seine Superhelden sind weiß
Von Harry Potter hin zu Luke
Aber glaub mir, würden die dich persönlich kennen, 
Würden die aussehen wollen wie du.
Und ich weiß es,
Dass es manchmal nicht leicht ist, 
Braun zu sein wenn die Mehrheit hier weiß ist,
Und man schaut sich um und vergleicht sich, fühlt sich alleine und ist verzweifelt.
Ich hab?s am eigenen Leib erlebt,
Aber hab mit der Zeit gelernt,
Dass die Zweifel und der Schmerz mit den Jahr?n vergeh?n
Und do erkennst deinen eigenen Wert, aber bis dahin:

Refrain:
Wär? ich so gern dein Superheld, 
Dein Superheld mit brauner Haut, 
Aber ich kann nicht durch die Lüfte fliegen, 
Kann aus den Händen keine Blitze schießen,
Aber was ich kann, ist für dich da zu sein und dir versprechen, dich zu lieben.


Denn viele Leute könn?n es sich nicht vorstellen
Und wissen nicht wie es is?,
Wenn man als brauner Junge in einem weißen Land aufwächst und irgendwas vermisst, was do hier nicht kriechst
Weil do oft hier der Einzige bist
Und ab und zu wirst do gedisst
Aber glaub mir
Nein besser noch, Baby, glaub an dich
Und kannst alles schaffen was do willst.
Doch ich weiß es,
Dass es manchmal nicht leicht ist, 
Anders zu sein wenn die Mehrheit hier gleich ist
Und man schaut sich um und vergleicht sich,
Fühlt sich alleine und is? verzweifelt.
Ich hab?s am eignen Leib erlebt,
Aber bin meinen Weg gegangen und bin kein Superheld (ohhh nein)
Nur ein einfacher Mann, der für dich da sein wird sein Leben lang
Aber trotzdem:

Refrain:
Wär? ich so gern dein Superheld, 
Dein Superheld mit brauner Haut, 
Aber ich kann nicht durch die Lüfte fliegen, 
Kann aus den Händen keine Blitze schießen,
Aber was ich kann, ist für dich da zu sein und dir versprechen, dich zu lieben.

(Duum, do do duduuum, (ja), do do dudum (eeeeeey))
Pass auf!
Mein Superheld ist grade mal halb so groß wie ich, 
Nein er ist kein großer Typ,
Aber schon so großartig.
Ja, das ist mein kleiner Mann,
Scheint als ob er alles kann
Er spielt so gut Fußball, 
In zwei Jahren zieht er Ballack ab.
Er kann schnell rennen, gut schwimmen, sicher Fahrrad fahren,
Malt mir schöne Bilder an Weihnachten oder Vatertag,
Er singt, spielt Klavier und spielt die Drums 
Baut innerhalb einer Minute so?n Transformer zusammen!
Doch das ist nicht alles was er kann,
Er kann schreiben und lesen,
Rechnen, aber auch freestylen und breaken,
Passt in der Schule auf, denn er will gebildet sein,
Er ist immer nett zu Menschen,
Er ist immer hilfsbereit.
Superdicke Muckis und Sixpack aus Stahl,
Superheld mit brauner Haut ist jetzt normal
Und es gibt da draußen viele davon,
Wartet ab, eure Zeit hier hat grade erst begonn?n
(dow ow ow ow yeah)

Refrain:
Wär? ich so gern dein Superheld, 
Dein Superheld mit brauner Haut, 
Aber ich kann nicht durch die Lüfte fliegen, 
Kann aus den Händen keine Blitze schießen,
Aber was ich kann, ist für dich da zu sein und dir versprechen, dich zu lieben.

Schwarz auf weiß, in mei'm Poesiealbum (Album, Album)

Hallo Deutschland, kennt ihr mich noch?
Kennt ihr das noch? Echten Hip-Hop!
In 'nem Land, wo man sogar mit 'nem Hit floppt
Wo der Soul keine Seele hat, der Rock nich' rockt
Wo bei Funk oft der Funke nicht überspringt
Und der Reggae leider nach Schlagerliedern klingt
Und der Rap so 'ne schlechte Reputation hat
Wer kann dieses Gefühl von damals wiederbringen?
Wer bitte, wer wer kann es sein?
Sag mir den Namen und ich nehm ihn unter Vertrag
Oder die, oder sie, ganz egal wer es ist
Hast du bitte mal 'ne E-mail oder Nummer parat?
Nein, es gibt kein' denn die Sänger sing'n und die Rapper kling'n
Als hätten sie nie Hunger gehabt
Und sogar wenn's im Internet deine Lieder umsont gäb
Keiner mit Geschmack hätte die je runtergeladen, denn
Nun ist es da, unmittelbar, 100 Karat, warum ich das sag?
Ich bin so brillant, so phänomenal, fundamental
Radikal so wie in jüngeren Jahren
Als ich direkt aus'm Untergrund kam
Und diese Position, die ich mir hier erarbeitet hab'
Kann keine Geldsumme bezahlen aber ich komme nicht klar
Auf diese ganzen Rapper die scheinbar nix wissen über diese Kunstform
Und deshalb muss ich die Massen von Neuem bekehren
Und das Verständnis für unsere Kunst form'
Denn ich hab' dieses Haus hier mit aufgebaut
Ihr habt's demoliert, ich hab's renoviert
Ich bin der Super-MC, ich bin das Buch von Jay-Z
Ich hab Rap für die Massen hier dekodiert
Definiert, etabliert und noch mehr schlaue Worte mit „iert“
Und wenn ihr vermutet, ich sei hier der beste Poet
Dann vermut' ich, dass ihr euch nich' irrt
Ich bin nur ein Fremder und habe mich aus Versehen hier verirrt
Ja, es gibt tausende Rapper da draußen, doch wen interessiert's?
Guck mal hier

Guck mal hier, dies' mein Poesielbum
Schau' mal rein, lies mein Poesiealbum
Schwarz auf weiß, in mei'm Poesiealbum

Ich bin so Schiller, so Goethe, so bitter, so böse
Noch immer der größte Poet der hier lebt
Wenn ihr jetzt noch mehr wollt
Fütter ich euch deutschen Dichtern Reime
Bis ihr alle Brecht wie Bertolt
Das ist für mich echter Erfolg
Wenn der Text noch mehr rollt
Und ich schein' wie der Morgenstern
Hoffe, dass ihr alle aus den Reim' und den Worten lernt
Meine Damen und Herren
Was würde ich bloß tun hier, wär' ich nich' Rapstar?
Wahrscheinlich wär' ich der neue Erich Kästner
Lass' die ganzen Neider schnell noch fertig lästern
Nur durch euren Hass werd ich besser
Kletter hoch auf der Karrieretreppe
Oh nein, das heißt Karriereleiter
Wenn's 'n Fehler war, dann nur ein derbe kleiner
Und ja, ich bin ein sehr gemeiner
Rapper, der aus der Masse heraussticht
Du bist einfach nur irgendeiner
Was du machst, interessiert überhaupt nich'
Wünschst dein Flow wäre mehr wie meiner
Kannst gern probier'n zu kopier'n, doch ich glaubs nich'
Dass du es schaffst, oder raffst, was ich mach, wie ich's mach
Wenn ich's mach, es is' einfach unglaublich
Es ist wie, wenn Wilhelm Tell und William Shakespeare
Auf Crack wär'n, nach'n Paar Beck's-Bier nur ich bin brauner
Und noch'n bisschen sexier, check den Text hier,
So flüssig und heilend, nenn ihn Elixier
Das heißt Zaubertrank
Bitte merks dir (Bitte merks dir, bitte merks dir)

Lass sie alle reden, lass die Halle beben
Was für'n geiles Leben, ich mache Scheine, scheine
Indem ich Reime reime so wie Heinrich Heine
Album kommt im Frühjahr
Und meine Konkurrenz wird spätestens im August ein' Fall erleben
Der Richter und Henker für Dichter und Denker
Er stürzte ab, denn er war von der Dürre matt
Und stand zu dicht am Geländer
Von meinem Hotel Suite-Balkon
Und das war's aus mei'm Poesiealbum
Und darauf reimt sich grobe Viehhaltung

Until it falls and breaks
And it crumbles like sand
And we all go like

I've been waiting, watching you all night
I don't know why

In the morning
I'll be waking wishing I was right
Maybe sometimes
In the evening I'll take you out for dinner and a fight
Can't read your mind I can't read your mind
We watched the sun go down and then the moon comes out
Paint pictures with your hand
I'll chase you
I'm your biggest fan

Who's gonna catch you now who's gonna catch you now
Running so far away so far away

My mind is black and blue
It keeps pictures of you
Now I know why

You moved away from here
To another hemisphere
All I want to be is in your company
I made a mixtape
With all the songs that you hate
Can't read your mind I give up this time

Who's gonna catch you now who's gonna catch you now
Running so far away so far away

Who's gonna catch you now who's gonna catch you now
Running so far away so far away

I heard your voice today
But we last spoke in may
I still miss you
Now you're a ghost at sea
Drifting peacefully
You'll never come back to me
I read your eulogy

San Cisco,"Well of course I miss you, baby
I've been thinking lately
 That you don't need me anymore
You'd be better with Fred Astaire 
He could take you anywhere
If you ask him to

And God knows 
That its a common misconception 
That I'm the only one for you
And I could take you out for breakfast 
But he could take you 'round the world

Fred Astaire's the man for you

Well, he could buy you a diamond ring
Or he could get you anything
If you ask him to
He probably know how to dance
And he could fly you to France 
And you could do it all night long",Fred Astaire
San Fermin,"I found me a hopeless case, and resolve to love
Maybe we can find a decent place
When I'm old enough
Found love in an empty gaze, try to fix it up

I'll fall for you soon enough
I resolve to love
Now I know it's just another fuck
'Cause I'm old enough
Sell lies like their only trust
It will pick me up
I'll fall for you soon enough, oho, oho

Oho, don't be scared, that it's a harder kind of feel
Hold on tight, you must hold on unless you're in it
Ease your mind, and when you think, you're thinking clear
It's alright, you really tired for a minute
I just say, that it's another on the clock
It is a summer-calling sickness

Sonsick at the t-ball games, I so feel luck
Maybe find a place where we could mess
When we're old enough
We can never go from all the rest
We can live it up
All pressed in the Sunday best, oho, oho

Sonsick at the t-ball games, I so feel luck
Maybe find a place where we could mess

Make plans and we'll buy the things, try to fix it up

San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus,"It only takes a tiny corner of 
This great big world to make a place you love
My home up on the hill
I find I love you still
I've been away but now I'm back to tell you

Open your golden gate
You let no stranger wait outside your door

Here is your wandering one 
Saying I'll wander no more
Other places only make me love you best
Tell me you're the heart of all the golden west

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando

San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus,"Half past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the phone
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Find the end of the rainbow, with that fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of T.V.
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
There's not a soul out there

Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice

Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

(Don't go sharing your devotion)

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little smalltalk, a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think I was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do

Don't go sharing your devotion

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
One of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call

Pulled my trigger, now he's dead

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family

Sanchez,"Last night I heard the screaming 
Loud voices behind the wall 
Another sleepless night for me
It won't do no good to call 
The police always come late 
If they come at all 

And when they arrive 
They say they can't interfere 
With domestic affairs 
Between a man and his wife 
And as they walk out the door 
The tears well up in her eyes

Last night I heard the screaming 
Then a silence that chilled my soul 
I prayed that I was dreaming 
When I saw the ambulance in the road 
And the policeman said 
""I'm here to keep the peace 
Will the crowd disperse 
I think we all could use some sleep""",Behind the Wall

I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees

Dreamin' of you and it's crazy

As soon as I get you out my head
I'm in your car again

Where the fuck we at now?

A big ass yellow, and green,
And purple, and faggot ass pink mushroom field

Well fuck it, let's go

Let's eat some of these bitches

Man I never did before, but since we in Oz and all

That's what I'm saying

Well let's at least walk while we eat, come on

Thoughts fly away in the mushroom field
Randomly telling what's revealed
Filling my pockets cause they worth a meal
And the kingdom's over them hills

Let me go ahead and eat a few of these things
See if I can't hang
What you thinkin' about?

Cigarettes, menthol only
To grow old with my kids and homies
All the years on that pole so lonely
And all them crows shittin' on me
What you thinkin' about?

Makin' payments on the Batmobile
With the phat sound system and 32 inch wheels
Everybody on the yellow brick jocking
Well I'm just snapping real slow

Everybody got a homie like that

I hope his momma doing good

Sittin' on triple gold daytons
Sun shining on 'em and they sparkle up the pavement
People wanna catch a glimpse and show respect
Now I'm the king
Ruler over everything
What you thinkin' about?

A fine bitch and some weed to smoke
I gotta have a little bit of puss to poke
(You ain't no joke)
A fat bag of dro and a hoe
And that's all you really need to know
What you thinking about?

Titties
They come in all shapes and sizes
Each bitch with they own surprises
And if they only had on they back when hitting doggy
You can suck on that

Shit, finishing off my Megos set
And making that small dream an accomplishment
So I can find a new hobby like collecting skin
Never removed from the package all mint

That's what I'm thinking about
They clothes so tight
Ass and titties lookin' so right
Stacks of cash and all kinds of tropical hash
And hittin' blunts till my last
Now what you thinkin' about?

Blaze Ya Dead Homie
(Who ya dead who?)
Who ya dead who?
Where I'm from that's cool
Anyway, I'm just wondering when it's Colton shit droppin'?
I'm tryin' to get my gold six hoping
What you thinking about?

Whatchin' my favorite wrestling pay-per-views
On a 100 foot screen
Televison tube
With the fast forward button
I can fly past the jobbers while eating pizza getting fat
What you thinking about?

Wizard, I really hope he's there
And he can help J get the fuck outta here
(I hear what you're saying crow, Tin what you think?)

What you thinkin' about?

What I'm thinkin' about, going home
And it's down this path we roam
Come on

Yes I do

If you had a mirror
Maybe you could count my tears

And if you were nearer
It would all be clearer

How I wish that you were here
How I wish, how I wish
How I wish that you were here

Before each day.

And promise that we'll never part, oh, no.

was what we really needed
you said this time would hurt more than it helps
but I couldn't see that
I thought it was the end
of a beautiful story
and so I left the one I loved at home to be alone(alone)
and I tried to find
out if this one thing is true
that I'm nothing without you
I know better now
and I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
whoo-oo-oo-oo yeah

And then I met someone
and thought she could replace you
we got a long just fine
we wasted time because she was not you
we had a lot of fun
though we knew we were faking
love was not impressed with our connection they were all lies, all lies
so I'm here cause I found this one thing is true
that I'm nothing without you

Know that I would fight the tides to
Be together

Feel better

Two hearts entwined, yes, you are mine
And I'll be your's forever

Sanctus Real,"I look around and see my wonderful life
Almost perfect from the outside
In picture frames I see my beautiful wife
Always smiling
But on the inside, I can hear her saying

""Lead me with strong hands
Stand up when I can't
Don't leave me hungry for love
Chasing dreams, what about us?

Show me you're willing to fight
That I'm still the love of your life
I know we call this our home
But I still feel alone.""

I see their faces, look in their innocent eyes
They're just children from the outside
I'm working hard, I tell myself they'll be fine
They're independent
But on the inside, I can hear them saying

""Lead me with strong hands
Stand up when I can't
Don't leave me hungry for love
Chasing dreams, what about us?

Show me you're willing to fight
That I'm still the love of your life
I know we call this our home
But I still feel alone.""

So Father, give me the strength
To be everything I am called to be
Oh, Father, show me the way
To lead them
Won't you lead me?

To lead them with strong hands
To stand up when they can't
Don't want to leave them hungry for love
Chasing things that I could give up

I'll show them I'm willing to fight
And give them the best of my life
So we can call this our home
Lead me, 'cause I can't do this alone

Father, lead me, 'cause I can't do this alone",Lead Me
Sanctus Real,"Sometimes I just want to start over, 'cause everything looks like a wreck
And I need the courage to carry on, 'cause I can't see what's ahead
And there are places I've wished I could be, battles I've wanted to win
Dreams that have slipped through my hands
I may never get back again

But I'm still a dreamer, a believer
Oh, I've lost my faith in so many things, but I still believe in You
'Cause You can make anything new

Sometimes I just wish we could say all the things that are easy to hear
Ignore the injustice we see and explain every unanswered prayer
But I'd rather speak honestly and wear a tattered heart on my sleeve
'Cause in the middle of my broken dreams, redemption is here

And I'm still a dreamer, a believer
Oh, I've lost my faith in so many things, but I still believe in You
'Cause You are the answer, the redeemer
Oh, I've given up on too many things, but I'm not giving up on You
'Cause You can make anything new

I don't have every answer in life
But I'm trusting You one day at a time
'Cause You can make a weak heart stay alive forever
This is where Heaven and Earth collide
I lift my hands and give my life
This is how my weary heart stays alive

Oh, I'm still a dreamer (This is where heaven and earth collide)
(I lift my hands and give my life)
Still a believer (This is how my weary heart stays alive)

To see this man from Galilee
Just a carpenter some say, leading fools astray
Yet many kneel to give Him praise

There is hope in the name of the Lord
Blessed is He, who comes in the name of the Lord

And when my strength is nearly gone
When there's nothing left to do but just depend on You
And the power of Your name

And as we call upon Your name
Your strength through weakness to show
We can know the masters plan extend the masters hand

Ani ohevet othka, I love you

The sounds are all as different
As the lands from which they came
And though our words are all unique
Our hearts are still the same

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

We teach the young our differences
Yet look how we're the same
We love to laugh, to dream our dreams
We know the sting of pain

From Leningrad to Lexington
The farmer loves his land
And daddies all get misty-eyed
To give their daughter's hand

Oh, maybe when we realize
How much there is to share
We'll find too much in common
To pretend it isn't there

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Though the rhetoric of government
May keep us worlds apart
There's no misinterpreting
The language of the heart

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear

Sandi Patty,"I've always heard there is a land
Beyond the mortal dreams of man
Where every tear will be left behind
But it must be in another time

There'll be an everlasting light
Shining a purest holy white
And every fear will be erased
But it must be in another place

So, I'm waiting for another time and another place
Where all my hopes and dreams will be captured
With one look at Jesus' face
Oh, my heart's been burnin'
My soul keeps yearnin'
Sometimes I can't hardly wait
For that sweet, sweet someday
When I'll be swept away
To another time and another place

I've grown so tired of earthly things
They promise peace but furnish pain
All of life's sweetest joys combined
Could never match those in another time
And though I've put my trust in Christ
And felt His Spirit move in my life
I know it's truly just a taste
Of His glory in another place","Another Time, Another Place"

And take me home what joy shall feel my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration and there proclaim

Jerusalem that day
The soldiers tried to clear the
narrow street
But the crowd pressed into see
A man condemned to die on
Calvary.

He was bleeding from a beating -
there were stripes upon His back
And He wore a crown upon his
head
And He bore with every step
The scorn of those of those of
those who cried out for his
death.

Down the Via Dolorosa called the
way of suffering
Like a lamb came the Messiah
Christ the King
But He chose to walk that road
out of His love for you and me

Their joyful tone to every home
(On without end, their joyful tone to every home)

Gayly they ring while people sing
Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here

Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas
(Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas)

Merry, Merry, Merry, Christmas

Hark, how the bells, sweet silver bells
All seem to say, throw cares away
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer
To young and old, meek and the bold

One seems to hear words of good cheer
From everywhere, filling the air

Oh, how they pound, raising the sound
O'er hill and dale, telling their tale
Gayly they ring while people sing
Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here

(Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas)
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas

On, on they send, on without end
Their joyful tone to every home

(On, on they send, on without end)

(Hear the bells, aah)

Hark, have a bell, sweet silver bells
Joyfully ring, boy is the king

Till the bells ring, Christ the Saviour is born

Sandi Patty,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song
Sandi Patty,"Christmas makes you feel emotional
It may be parties or thoughts devotional
Whatever happens or what may be
Here is what Christmas time means to me

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing
Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of streetlights, even stop-lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch, hear the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day
Soon it will be Christmas Day",Silver Bells

Sandi Patty,"Your eyes look around the distant stars 
Taking in everything in galaxies so far
Yet on one crowded planet, circling one certain sun
Of the billions here I am only one
Yet you see me, You see me, see me

Your ears taking each day's deafening roar
The screams, the machines, rockets, radios and more
Word of each man and woman, prayers of each boy and girl
Every cry and curse still somehow in this world
You hear me, You hear me, hear me

Before a word is on my tongue,
You've seen it birth within my heart
You even understand my reasons 
For You search my deepest parts and
You know me, You know me, know me

That's why Father God I stand amazed 
For you know me so well
Yet I'm lavished with Your grace
You forgive all my sin

Your sunlight shakes the morning sky
How'd You ever find me
Through the blue of my darkest night

And all, and all, and all my life,You're all I've never known
You're all I need to feel alive, this heart has found its home
This heart has found its home

No one need remind me where I've been
In younger years I'd gone astray
Somewhere down the wrong road You took my hand
And let me here today

And all, and all, and all my life,You're all I've never known
You're all I need to feel alive, this heart has found its home
This heart has found its home

Like where I've always longed to be
Will never seem to find
Until Your grace would have done my eyes

How'd You ever find me

Your voice it covers all my shame, the old You turned to new

You see a destiny, a perfect promise

You call me worthy of Your Son's own precious blood
You call me holy, You call me strong at my weakest
Forgive an impure, You call me Yours

It's hard for me to understand exactly what You see
I slip and stumble everyday but still You say believe
He'll say you finish what you start
You've seen me from my heart and not the bruises

Sandi Patty,"Was it a morning like this?
When the Son still hid from Jerusalem
And Mary rose from her bed
To tend to the Lord she thought was dead

Was it a morning like this?
When Mary walked down from Jerusalem
And two angels stood at the tomb
Bearers of news she would hear soon

Did the grass sing?
Did the earth rejoice to feel You again?

Over and over like a trumpet underground
Did the earth seem to pound, ""He is risen!""
Over and over in a never-ending round
""He is risen, hallelujah, hallelujah!""

Was it a morning like this?
When Peter and John ran from Jerusalem
And as they raced towards the tomb
Beneath their feet was there a tune?

Did the grass sing?
Did the earth rejoice to feel You again?

Over and over like a trumpet underground
Did the earth seem to pound, ""He is risen!""
Over and over in a never-ending round
""He is risen, hallelujah, hallelujah!""

Over and over like a trumpet underground
Did the earth seem to pound, ""He is risen!""

Sandi Patty,"Would you look around you now
And tell me what you see
Faces full of hate and fear
Faces full of me

Do you feel the rumblings?
As your head comes crumbling down
Do you know what I mean

Run, you better run you know
The end is getting near
Feel the wind of something hard
Come whistling past your ear

As they try to get you
Where it will upset you down
Now you know what I mean

Someday you will see how long
We've waited for the time
To show you how we've died
To get together with you all

Twist and turn your head around
Till everything's unclear
Twist and turn your arm around
Until it is not there

And they'd love to burn you
Or at least to turn you around
Now you know what I mean

Can you look around you now
And tell us what's to be
Can you look inside yourself
And tell us what you see

As you feel the rumblings
As your head comes crumbling down
And you know what I mean

Someday you will see how long
We've waited for the time
To show you how we've died
To get together with you all

Sandi Patty,"Time measured out my days
Life carried me along
In my soul I yearned to follow God
But knew Id never be so strong
I looked hard at this world
To learn how heaven could be gained
Just to end where I began
Where human effort is all in vain

[Chorus:]
Were it not for grace
I can tell you where Id be
Wandering down some pointless road to nowhere
With my salvation up to me
I know how that would go
The battles I would face
Forever running but losing this race
Were it not for grace

So here is all my praise
Expressed with all my heart
Offered to the Friend who took my place
And ran a course I could not start
And when He saw in full
Just how much His would cost
He still went the final mile between me and heaven
So I would not be lost

Were it not for grace",Were It Not for Grace
Sandi Patty,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
An emblem of sufferin' and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a word of lost sinners were slain

Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the old rugged cross, I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share

Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown",The Old Rugged Cross

Why I can sing when things go wrong.

For even hills resound with music.
They just can't help it. God gave the song.

Day after day. that song goes on.
For once you know the source of music
You'll always hear it. God gave the song.

Sometimes it heals sometimes it hurts....

When record shops were still on top, and vinyl was all that they stocked,
And the super-info highway was still drifting out in space,
Kids were wearing hand me downs, and playing games meant kick around,
And footballers still had long hair and dirt across their face,

Sandi Thom,"A simple scent of summer stole my heart for the last dance
The smell of two-stroke petrol from a motorbike we used to have
Those playing fields of cut grass you know high school left me kind of blue
Now with every sweet summer breeze I'll be thinking of you

[Chorus]
Now I'm waiting for the sunset borderline
Every suns gotta set with time
But I'll remember those moments for evermore
As the days where nothing had changed at all.

Found a long lost picture of the car we used to run
Cotton candy colored paintwork looked so faded in the sun
And that 6 o clock sunrise you always used to drive me to
Guess that long lost picture will always have me thinking, have me thinking of
you

[Chorus]

So for every little sad sweet love song that's ever sung, I'll be thinking
And for every lost summers day that ever been and gone, I'll be thinking
I wonder if your gonna be the tear that follows me,
Until that sun is set I guess I'll always be

Tried to listen through the rain while
Humming those melodies alone

When the people go home you're left all alone
To face the sadness behind closed doors

Don't want superman don't need wonderland
Just want you to love me

To be the belle of the ball

Where the bribes are paid 
Honey, they turned my offer down 
They say the deal's already made 
So now I gotta stand and watch 
While it all comes down 
And the buzzards and the hawks 
And the judges and the mob

Now if I were the queen of all the world 
I would go in chains just to see you free 
Of the ropes that bind you 
And the role you play 
And the pride that hooks you 
While the big ones get away

It quickly stays the same 
Money junkies hire all the smart ones 
Power junkies run the game 

One step at a time

Then the good guys will 
With angels on the take 
And the gangsters in the yard 
Hey don't the wars come easy 
Hey don't the peace come hard 

Now if I had a way to reach the sky 
I'd grab that crescent moon 
Wield it like a knife 
Save you from the lies 
From the ropes that bind you 
And the role you play 
And the game that hooks you

On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""
I would gratefully appreciate if you see him tell him
I'm in the park with my girlfriend and please
Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",Frank Mills [#][*]

Conmigo en la eternidad y entiendo
No eras para mí pero te querré siempre

Y aunque pase el tiempo y seas feliz con alguien más
Recuerda que no hay nada que haga que me olvide de ti
yo sé

A quien tú decidiste amar
No sé si sepa que no hay personas
Como tu aquí en la tierra
Te prometo no vuelvo a llorar
Sé lo felices que están y cuiden
Lo que yo soñé, siempre quise para mí

Si tuviera una oportunidad
Le cambiaria el final a todo
Pero no podría porque
La verdad me da gusto que estás
Conmigo en la eternidad y entiendo
No eras para mí pero te querré siempre

De corazón, ámense",A  quien tu decidiste amar
Sandoval,"¿Para Que? 
¿De que me sirve sentir la vida? 
¿De que me sirve sentir el amor? 
¿Y para que vestirte de día? 
Si allá afuera te dice que no 

¿De que me sirve vestirme de noche? 
Con la esperanza de que sucedan 
Las esperanzas del corazón 
Cuando allá afuera te dicen que no 

¿Y para que nos sentemos? 
A ver la gente pasar 
Para envidiar nuestra formula 
De quien Sabemos amar 

¿Y dime tu quien te invito? 
A la fiesta de este perdedor 
Yo estaba tan bien sin ti 
Y ahora solo me hace sufrir 

¿Y para que demostrarle a la vida? 
¿Que no soy cualquiera y yo? 
Siempre despierto con la alergia 
Que estarás tú 

¿Y como dices tu las cosas? 
No me pienses no me ames 
Solo vivo para los momentos 
Y si piensas en mi vete a dormir 
No soy nada para ti 

¿Dime tú que hay en tu cabeza? 
Esta canción es otra mas para ti 
Pero y anda ve 
Ya lo sabe dios sabe que intente 
Darte todo mi amor 

Tengo rabia hacia el amor 
Tengo furia en mi pasión 
Tengo ganas de gritar 
Y de romper todo 

Quisiera echarle a la culpa 
A la melancolía 
Pero me haces sentir 
Que me voy a morir sin ti 
Sin ti uoh no, no, no 

¿Para que? ¿Para que? 
Sin ti ¿Para que? 
¿Para que?",¿Para qué?
Sandoval,"En un instante te pierdo y yo no creo que sea verdad 
Por que tenemos recuerdos que presumías al amar 
Y tengo miedo del tiempo que viene lento para olvidar 
Y verte después de esto sólo me hará sentirme mal 
Donde está el amor? 
Que nos sucedió? 

Quiero oír tú voz diciéndome que 
Solamente yo fui soy y seré 
El único amor que es para siempre 
Piensa bien pues se que aún me quieres 

En estas cuatro paredes que sólo me hacen recordar 
Hasta el más tibio momento que juramos no acabar 
Es por ti frío que tengo y ya no quiero respirar 
Pero maldigo el momento que decidiste terminar 
Donde está el amor?

Quiero oír tú voz diciéndome que 
Solamente yo fui soy y seré

Piensa bien pues se que aún me quieres 

Aunque desde hoy ya no estaremos

Pero un error mató el dese",¿Que nos sucedió?
Sandoval,"Te das cuenta pasa el tiempo y sumas años
Y entre mas conoces, mas vas a extrañar
Pues la vida sin tomar de decisiones
Que quizás solo nos queda el recordar

Se nos vienen a la mente los momentos
Que por ser primeros eran de verdad
Acordarnos del primer sentimiento
Que te hizo caminar a donde estas

Y se te olvida que no eres eterno
Todo tiene un final
Se nos va acabando el tiempo
Y se te olvida que la vida no es para estar
Siempre pensando en el pasado
Siempre planeando el futuro
Las cosas buenas van pasando
Frente a ti cada segundo
Y se te olvidan, oh no
O no quieres darte cuenta, oh no no no
Deja que la vida (deja que la vida) te sorprenda

No le temas a este mundo sino lo hubiera
Ten le pánico a lo que pudiste ser
Porque el tiempo sabes bien que no regresa
No te apures lo que viene, viene bien

Y se te olvida que no eres eterno
Todo tiene un final
Se nos va acabando el tiempo
Y se te olvida que la vida no es para estar
Siempre pensando en el pasado
Siempre planeando el futuro

Sandoval,"Yo sé que tú, eres la persona más
Dispuesta que, te quiero pero mucho más
Yo estoy aquí, justo frente a ti
Con las mismas ganas de querer, y yo lo sé muy bien

Que somos iguales en todo, y creo
Que soy la persona, que tú estas buscando
Y yo pienso amarte
Hasta que la vida me alcance

Hoy ya sé que es vivir
Veo la vida en ti y en todo lo que haces
Quiero hacerte sentir que veas la vida en mí
Como la veo en ti y me ames

A que termines con tus juegos del amor 
Pues de rodillas crees que tu me tienes 
Y te equivocas quien se va de aquí soy yo 

Y no lo vuelvo hacer, no trates otra vez 
Despídete de quien realmente te iba a querer 
Y el día de mañana que te arrepientas 
Trata de no pensar en mi 
Y en tus recuerdos 

Regresa el tiempo pon los momentos 
Que a ti te hicieron sentir de nuevo amor 
Y pídele a tu corazón que se apiade 
Para que cuando te sientas triste 
Y no este nadie no me supliques 
Y otra vez me enamore de quien me hizo perder tanto, tanto tiempo

Cuando pensabas que tanto me amabas 
Yo te creía y me lo hiciste tu saber 
Y de la nada ya no te portaba 
Me hiciste a un lado y hoy solo quieres volver 

Y no lo vuelvo hacer, no trates otra vez 
Despídete de quien realmente te iba a querer

Sandoval,"No basta con que te ame y que de vuelta sonrías
Y respondas lo mismo aunque sea una mentira
Es algo que me está matando lento y tu sabes por qué
Porque de frente me miras y ami espalda me olvidas
Sales corriendo buscándote dónde esconder
Es el momento de quedarnos solos y quieras romper

Y cuando llega la noche, me encuentro a solas conmigo
Llorar no me da el alivio ni tu silencio lo es
Por más que busco motivos de que quieras huir
Pues ya tu amor no es el mismo y yo me muero por ti

Y bueno, el sol ha salido veo la risa en los niños
Y mi dolor que no sale y no sale jamás
Siento esa envidia por la gente que no está en mi lugar
No sé si deba enfrentarte y que me digas qué pasa
Aunque es muy obvio que por mi ya no sientes nada

Si yo sé que nunca te he fallado, solo di por qué
El amor no se cuestiona
Y convencerte yo sé que soy yo quien se hace daño
Por consecuencia a ti también
Si tus razones caducan, aquí yo estaré
Pero no me hagas más daño, que yo a ti no te lo haré

Y cuando llega la noche, la noche me encuentro a solas conmigo
Llorar no me da el alivio
Ni tu silencio lo es
Por más que busco motivos de que quieras huir
Pues ya tu amor no es el mismo, el mismo
Y yo me muero por ti, y yo me muero por ti

Y cuando llega la noche, la noche me encuentro a solas conmigo
Llorar no me da el alivio ni tu silencio lo es
Por más que busco motivos de que quieras huir

Sandoval,"Ya llevo días pensando en como decirte que te quiero tanto 
Y ya encontré la forma de decírtelo: Te quiero tanto

Por favor quédate para siempre en mi voz 

Y permiteme ser de tí 
Una estrella entres tus sueños 
Y hacerte sonreír

Para que tu vuelvas a mi
Demuestra lo que sientes 
Que me quieres dilo fuerte 
No lo esperes ven conmigo 
Estoy contigo hasta el fin 

Todo este tiempo sin tu amor 
Ha sido en vano porque nos queremos 
Y hace daño hacer a un lado 
Al sentimiento y al corazón 
Lo estamos matando de amor
No es justo para los dos

Mientras la vida pasa se nublan 
Los sueños, el tiempo es eterno 
Yo sé lo que quiero Yo 
Yo quiero volver, te amo 
Y a tu lado el gris se vuelve azul 
Y solo importas tu

Y cuanto te amo por siempre 
Viviré amándote lo sé
Regresa temprano aquí te esperaré 
Ilusionado por volverte a ver 

Se libre con tú decisión 
Te ofrezco todo lo que soy 
Mi entrega es completa 
Sin fronteras, pertenezco a un 
Juramento que habla de darte amor 
Y aquí estoy 

Si me permites por favor 
Te haré feliz porque yo soy 
La esencia que en tu ausencia 
Has derramado y a acabado
Abre la puerta deja que entre mi voz 
Deja que entre yo 

Mientras la vida pasa se nublan

Yo quiero volver, te amo

Se ah acabado porque nunca empezó

Porque me duele y te perdí también 

Yo te digo adiós hasta que tu no me hagas volver 
Voy a olvidarme de lo que fué voy a borrarlo 
Sabes que me alejo porque jamás fui yo 
Que recibiera más de lo que siempre te doy

Porque si te me vas me muero no
No me puedes prohibir que sienta la magia
Que siento yo por ti

Pero bueno la vida es así

Perdón si te incomoda la situación
La culpa es del amor
Quiero agradecerte voy aparecerte así

Sandoval,"Yo sé que tú, eres la persona más
Dispuesta que, te quiero pero mucho más
Yo estoy aquí, justo frente a ti
Con las mismas ganas de querer, y yo lo sé muy bien

Que somos iguales en todo, y creo
Que soy la persona, que tú estas buscando
Y yo pienso amarte
Hasta que la vida me alcance

Hoy ya sé que es vivir
Veo la vida en ti y en todo lo que haces
Quiero hacerte sentir que veas la vida en mí
Como la veo en ti y me ames

Llevarte de una mano hasta el sol
Ser para siempre tú y yo
Confesar que había soñado
Contigo entre tus brazos

No sé si tú, has llegado a tocar
Mi corazón, cuando lo haces palpitar
Yo estoy aquí, justo frente a ti

Sandoval,"Y tu pretendes que yo a ti te espere 
A que termines con tus juegos del amor 
Pues de rodillas crees que tu me tienes 
Y te equivocas quien se va de aquí soy yo 

Y no lo vuelvo hacer, no trates otra vez 
Despídete de quien realmente te iba a querer 
Y el día de mañana que te arrepientas 
Trata de no pensar en mi 
Y en tus recuerdos 

Regresa el tiempo pon los momentos 
Que a ti te hicieron sentir de nuevo amor 
Y pídele a tu corazón que se apiade 
Para que cuando te sientas triste 
Y no este nadie no me supliques 
Y otra vez me enamore de quien me hizo perder tanto, tanto tiempo

Cuando pensabas que tanto me amabas 
Yo te creía y me lo hiciste tu saber 
Y de la nada ya no te portaba 
Me hiciste a un lado y hoy solo quieres volver 

Y no lo vuelvo hacer, no trates otra vez 
Despídete de quien realmente te iba a querer 
Y el día de mañana que te arrepientas 
Trata de no pensar en mi 
Y en tus recuerdos

Y pídele a tu corazón que se apiade 
Para que cuando te sientas triste 
Y no este nadie no me supliques 
Y otra vez me enamore de quien me hizo perder tanto, tanto tiempo",No Trates Otra Vez
Sandoval,"No basta con que te ame y que de vuelta sonrías
Y respondas lo mismo aunque sea una mentira
Es algo que me está matando lento y tu sabes por qué
Porque de frente me miras y ami espalda me olvidas
Sales corriendo buscándote dónde esconder
Es el momento de quedarnos solos y quieras romper

Y cuando llega la noche, me encuentro a solas conmigo
Llorar no me da el alivio ni tu silencio lo es
Por más que busco motivos de que quieras huir
Pues ya tu amor no es el mismo y yo me muero por ti

Y bueno, el sol ha salido veo la risa en los niños
Y mi dolor que no sale y no sale jamás
Siento esa envidia por la gente que no está en mi lugar
No sé si deba enfrentarte y que me digas qué pasa
Aunque es muy obvio que por mi ya no sientes nada

Si yo sé que nunca te he fallado, solo di por qué
El amor no se cuestiona
Y convencerte yo sé que soy yo quien se hace daño
Por consecuencia a ti también
Si tus razones caducan, aquí yo estaré
Pero no me hagas más daño, que yo a ti no te lo haré

Y cuando llega la noche, la noche me encuentro a solas conmigo
Llorar no me da el alivio
Ni tu silencio lo es
Por más que busco motivos de que quieras huir
Pues ya tu amor no es el mismo, el mismo
Y yo me muero por ti, y yo me muero por ti

Y cuando llega la noche, la noche me encuentro a solas conmigo
Llorar no me da el alivio ni tu silencio lo es
Por más que busco motivos de que quieras huir
Pues ya tu amor no es el mismo, el mismo
Y yo me muero",La  Noche
Sandoval,"Ya llevo días pensando en como decirte que te quiero tanto 
Y ya encontré la forma de decírtelo: Te quiero tanto 

Ya lo sé 
Tan rápido y tan mágico 
Tan libre que es mi corazón 
Tan Libre que te pediré 

Por favor quédate para siempre en mi voz 

Y permiteme ser de tí 
Una estrella entres tus sueños 
Y hacerte sonreír 
Déjame ser para tí 
Te presumiré y le contaré 
A todo aquel que me salude 
Que me enamoré 
Siempre siempre yo te cuidaré 

Y solamente acércate dame tu mano, abrázame muy fuerte 
Y mírame pero con los ojos cerrados, dime que me quieres

Sandoval,"Quiero saber que hay que decir 
Para que tu vuelvas a mi
Demuestra lo que sientes 
Que me quieres dilo fuerte 
No lo esperes ven conmigo 
Estoy contigo hasta el fin 

Todo este tiempo sin tu amor 
Ha sido en vano porque nos queremos 
Y hace daño hacer a un lado 
Al sentimiento y al corazón 
Lo estamos matando de amor
No es justo para los dos

Mientras la vida pasa se nublan 
Los sueños, el tiempo es eterno 
Yo sé lo que quiero Yo 
Yo quiero volver, te amo 
Y a tu lado el gris se vuelve azul 
Y solo importas tu 

Te extraño y no aguanto volvamos 
A nacer olvida todo y ven 
Y cuanto te amo por siempre 
Viviré amándote lo sé
Regresa temprano aquí te esperaré 
Ilusionado por volverte a ver 

Se libre con tú decisión 
Te ofrezco todo lo que soy 
Mi entrega es completa 
Sin fronteras, pertenezco a un 
Juramento que habla de darte amor 
Y aquí estoy 

Si me permites por favor 
Te haré feliz porque yo soy 
La esencia que en tu ausencia 
Has derramado y a acabado
Abre la puerta deja que entre mi voz 
Deja que entre yo 

Mientras la vida pasa se nublan 
Los sueños, el tiempo es eterno 
Yo sé lo que quiero Yo 
Yo quiero volver, te amo 
Y a tu lado el gris se vuelve azul 
Y solo importas tu

Tú, la dueña intacta de mi corazón

Ahora es tuyo mi amor, niña ven por favor
Que tu amor, sea para mí

Sandoval,"Todo el tiempo que tu me has dado no ah sido en vano no 
Al contrario me has enseñado todo lo que soy yo 
Y temblando yo te confieso que todo a partir de hoy 
Se ah acabado porque nunca empezó 

Quien se enamora llora dos veces yo quiero correr 
Porque me duele y te perdí también 

Yo te digo adiós hasta que tu no me hagas volver 
Voy a olvidarme de lo que fué voy a borrarlo 
Sabes que me alejo porque jamás fui yo 
Que recibiera más de lo que siempre te doy 
Y ojalá que nunca sientas algo igual 

Algo pasa no me has soltado y no me has dejado ir 
Ten cuidado me estas haciendo daño quiero salir 
Y aunque te amo creo que es mejor huir 

Quien se enamora llora dos veces yo quiero correr 
Porque me duele y te perdí también 

Yo te digo adiós hasta que tu no me hagas volver 
Voy a olvidarme de lo que fué voy a borrarlo y me perderé 
Y trataré de que tu jamás sepas en donde encontrarme yo 
Si yo te encuentro te vuelvo a amar y de eso no quiere

Sandoval,"Siento una impotencia aquí en mi loco corazón
Siento la tristeza que me abraza y sin pudor
Tengo tanto miedo enamorarme porque sé
Que jamás seré correspondida y mírame

Y permíteme déjate querer
No pido nada a cambio, por favor quédate
Porque si te me vas me muero no
No me puedes prohibir que sienta la magia
Que siento yo por ti
Tu, tu no hagas nada
Las cosas no cambiaran
Pero bueno la vida es así

Perdón si te incomoda la situación
La culpa es del amor
Quiero agradecerte voy aparecerte así 
Con esa sonrisa que solo habla bien de ti

Déjame cantar estas canción es para ti
No des media vuelta, no me dejes solo aquí

Y permíteme, déjate querer
No pido nada a cambio, por favor quédate

Me lo inventé, y son mis ganas 
De darte un mundo en un suspiro

Aunque Yo no te importe nada 
Y te diré que te quiero 
Porque no puedo 
No hacerlo, intentaré 
Algo nuevo, aunque Yo sé, siempre pierdo Yo

Tengo que reconocer
No soy para Ti lo sé 
Esto nunca podrá ser traté

Quisiera entender 
Si Yo sabá que no te iba a pasar 
Si Yo sabía que Tú te marcharás 
Si Yo sabía 
Para que perder el tiempo en lago 
Que me iba a matar 
Y Yo tendría que rendirme aunque 
Sé que no lo quiero hacer

Pero intentaré no hacerme 
Tanto daño para que lo intentó 
Si aunque lo hago no te ganaré
Si Yo, Yo sabía
¿Para Qué?

Cuando no estás, me haces tanta 
Falta y cuando estás 
Me arrancó el alma 
Porqué no puedo darte nada 
Me quedo solo y con mis ganas 

Motivare más mis sueños porque Yo solo así 
Te tengo, estoy cansado por quererlo 
Me siento vivo y también muerto 

Yo tengo que reconocer
No soy para ti Ti lo sé
Esto nunca podrá ser

Sandoval,"No porque le tenga tanto miedo a mi pasado.
Lo que fue yo creo que ya quedo muy enterrado,
Es momento para poderme salir de aquí, corriendo.
Ahora que ya estas aquí te ruego, te suplico
Que me hagas ver de nuevo el sol del paraíso
Que me enseñes nuevamente a poder querer.

Quiero aprender amarte y que me ames también

Quiero saber si eres tu con quien yo voy a envejecer,
Que puedas hacer tu de mi una mejor persona.
Quiero saber si seré yo
Quien vaya a estar contigo al fin
Y te daré lo mejor de mi, eso te lo aseguro.

Si me tomas de la mano yo puedo sentir
Si en verdad estas jugando o buscas mas de mi.
Te lo advierto por que no quiero salir de aquí llorando

Quiero darme la oportunidad de que el amor
Fue conmigo un majadero y hoy pide perdón
Que te puso en mi camino para que yo
Te ame
Quiero aprender amarte y que me ames también

Quiero saber si eres tu con quien yo voy a envejecer,
Que puedas hacer tu de mi una mejor persona.
Quiero saber si seré yo
Quien vaya a estar contigo al fin
Y te daré lo mejor de mi, eso te lo aseguro.

Never reaching the end
Letters I've written
Never meaning to send

Beauty I'd always missed
With these eyes before
Just what the truth is
I can't say anymore

Cause I love you
Yes I love you
Oh how I love you

Gazin at people
Some hand in hand
Just what I'm goin through
They can't understand

Cause I love you
Yes I love you
Oh how I love you

Thoughts they cannot defend
Just what you want to be
You will be in the end

Sandra,"Baby's in the parlour waiting for the rain 
Beating like a hammer washing out her pain 
Clearing like the one seven years ago 
When her first big love melted like the snow 
Back then she doubted, if she would ever find a man 
Who could love her that way the same way again 
And just when she thought she's living in vain 
The man of her dreams came like the rain 

When love is the price freedom is the cost 
Love is the price freedom is the cost 
And just when you think everything is lost 
Love will be your price 
And I'll know, I would not change a thing 
Cause I know I would not change a thing 

They spoke about her dreams 
They spoke about love 
They spoke about all the things she was so afraid of 
He had a key-word for everything she felt 
So it didn't take long till' he got her nailed 
Pin ones hope on someones elses life 
And all your dreams will hurt you like a knife 
The same whit her she soon got lost 
When love is the price freedom is the cost 

She didn't trust that very first man 
To come to her life trying' to understand 
What nobody ever could before 
He only made her see there is something more 
To learn about freedom to free about love 
To handle all the things she was so afraid of 
To always follow what she really felt inside 
Everything else is like a roller coasters ride",Love Is the Price

They didn’t know the rating was X
So when the man would not let them in
They decided to taste the apple of sex

They snuck in the back door into the movie
The curtain was drawn up, there was the screen
Violet with figures all out of rhythm
All out of high school, but in their teens

There was an attraction to be an actor
Forgetting the play was only a play
They only devoured the skin of the apple
And found they were hungry day after day

Then the usher came and threw them out of the garden
Then the movie turned to rain
Only love can give the sunlight to the picture
Only light can go beyond the skin of thinking
And bring the winking children home again

For the pain is hard to bear

Where the rain is made of angels’ tears, all shed for joy

Or is it there behind my inner voice?

I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few

And these few precious days I'll spend with you

Que vendrá mas y mas

Ven la noche se nos va, de prisa y sin tener
Piedad de nuestro amor
Aférrate de mi y dame tu calor
Alivia mi agonía

Ay, ven que quiero la ilusión
De morir junto a ti, besándote mi amor
Pero la realidad es solo una verdad
La vida continúa

Ven quédate, junto a mí, sin hablar
Ven quiéreme, sin temer, sin pensar
Ven bésame, porque el tiempo se va
Y después del adiós nada mas

Ven la noche se nos va, de prisa y sin tener
Piedad de nuestro amor
Aférrate de mi y dame tu calor
Alivia mi agonía

Ven que quiero la ilusión
De morir junto a ti besándote mi amor
Pero la realidad es solo una verdad
La vida continúa

",La Vida Continua
Sandro,"Yo soy ese tan fácil de olvidar
Tan fácil de dejar perdido en la distancia
Yo soy el que resigna su dolor
Pues sabe que tu amor se aleja sin clemencia

No soy lo que se dice la virtud
Tampoco juventud valora mi existencia
Comprendo y justifico tu actitud
Tratando decorar tu actual adolescencia

No soy el prototipo del amante
Tampoco una pasión despierto en ti
Más muero al comprender que a cada instante
Pretendes alejarte tu de mi

Más vete, cuando quieras, cuanto antes
No creas que al marcharte he de morir
Yo he muerto desde el día en que dejaste
De sonreír, estando junto a mi

",Facil de Olvidar
Sandro,"¡Fuera! Fuera toda la tristeza
Que en el frío de esta mesa
Yo me voy a emborrachar, ay

¡Fuera! El dolor que hay en mi alma
Que me hace perder la calma
Y no me deja pensar

Por eso bebo

Ya todo terminó, todos se han ido
Amigos que he perdido, la vida y el amor
La fe, la juventud y la confianza
Se ha muerto mi esperanza, ya todo se acabó

¡Ay fuera! Fuera toda la tristeza
Que en el frío de esta mesa
¡Ay fuera! Fuera toda la tristeza
Que en el frío de esta mesa

Marcado está en mi rostro el frío agosto
De penas insondables, de dura adversidad
Buscando en cada copa aquella boca
Embriago mis sentidos, pues sé que no vendrá

Fuera!, fuera todo este mal sueño
De mi vida soy el dueño
Y en alcohol me voy a ahogar

",Por Eso Bebo
Sandro,"Nos conocimos de noche, por casualidad
Y nuestros nombres mentimos, por seguridad
Es que ella tenía en su mente no volverme a ver
Pero en un cuarto alquilado me dio su querer

Y ahora, nada me queda de ella después del amor
Pude olvidar su mirada, su piel y su vos
Pude quitar de mis manos la tibia humedad
Que entre gemidos y abrazos dejaba escapar

Sin un respiro y seguía de forma brutal
Dándome amor y sin tregua me hacía vibrar
Pude olvidarme de todo pero me quedé
Con una marca que nunca quitarme podré

Pues me dejó un gusto a mujer en la boca
Que no encontré besando probando otros labios jamás
Pues la busque besando de manera loca
A miles de bocas, ninguna fue igual

Sin un respiro y seguía de forma brutal
Dándome amor y sin tregua me hacía vibrar
Pude olvidarme de todo pero me quedé
Con una marca que nunca quitarme podré

Pues me dejó un gusto a mujer en la boca

Pues me dejó un gusto a mujer en la boca
Besando jamás

",Un Gusto a Mujer
Sandro,"La tensa situación y la emoción
Me embarga el corazón en este instante
Quisiera este momento definir

Ya próximo partir y preguntarte
Si, no me quieres, si no te hiere
Que yo me aleje de ti

Yo puedo entre mi duda deslumbrar
Que puedes olvidar todo un pasado
También en un momento destruir

Las cosas que deje a tu cuidado
Si, no me quieres, si no te hiere
Que yo me aleje de ti

La inquietud, que hay en mi
Morirá si de ti
Oigo las palabras viejas
Te amo solo a ti

No puedo yo partir si al regresar
No te vuelvo a encontrar entre mis brazos
Prefiero que me digas no va mas

A tener que llorar por mi fracaso
Si, no me quieres, si no te hiere
Que yo me aleje de ti

Morirá si de ti

Te amo solo a ti

Dime las palabras viejas

Sandro,"Te propongo disfrutar de una mañana
Caminando de mi mano una flor en tu ventana
O que algún violín gitano nos regale con su voz

Te propongo elegir la cartelera de algún cine continuado
O tal vez mirar vidrieras son las cosas de este amor
Yo no te propongo ni el sol ni las estrellas

Tampoco yo te ofrezco un castillo de ilusión
Yo tengo para darte tan solo cosas buenas
Triviales y sencillas las cosas de este amor

Ay mira que te propongo un amanecer cualquiera
Aferrada de mi brazo compartiendo una quimera
Te propongo simplemente que me quieras
Yo no te propongo ni el sol ni las estrellas

Tampoco yo te ofrezco un castillo de ilusión

Si este amor se va

Sé que fingirás dormir quizás y al regresar
Alguna cuota de mi amor quiero cobrar
Y noche a noche tú la espalda me darás

Sé que ya mis brazos no tendrán de tu calor
Y quizás piensen encontrar un nuevo amor

Si este amor se va

Tu pensarás quizá
Que a otro hombre podrás querer

De tenerte junto a mi

Y en tus ojos el dolor
Y tú habrás de recordar
Que hasta aquí llegó mi amor

Sandro,"Noche de amantes perdidos
Noches de viejas memorias
De amores solos y olvidos
En cada amante una historia

La calle está desolada
Y hay mucho frío en mi almohada
Ya no tengo de tu aliento
El calor que acostumbraba

Mi corazón ya desecho
Mi mano desesperada
Buscándote por el lecho
Más de ti no queda nada
Más de ti no queda nada

Noche de noches pasadas
Cuando tu amor yo tenía
Si hay una ley sobre amores
Te juro no lo sabía

Una ley de amores viejos
Que destruyó corazones
Para un amor como el mío
No existen ley ni razones

Pero ante tanta ignorancia
Dios justo me ha sentenciado
Habrá una ley sobre amores
Porque soy un condenado

",Noche de Amantes
Sandro,"Por ese palpitar, que tiene tu mirar
Yo puedo presentir, que tu debes sufrir
Igual que sufro yo, por esta situación
Que nubla la razón, sin permitir pensar

En que ha de concluir, el drama singular
Que existe entre los dos, tratando simular
Tan solo una amistad, mientras en realidad
Se agita la pasión, que envuelve al corazón

Y que me obliga a callar
¡Yo te amo, yo te amo!

Tus labios de rubi, de rojo carmesí
Parecen murumurar, mil cosas sin hablar
Y yo que estoy aqui, sentado frente a ti

Me siento desagrar, sin poder conversar
Tratando de decir, tal vez sea mejor
Me marche yo de aqui, para no vernos más
Total que más me da, yo se que sufrire
Pero al final tendré, tranquilo el corazón

Y así podré gritar
¡Yo te amo, yo te amo!

Tus labios de rubi, de rojo carmesí
Parecen murumurar, mil cosas sin hablar
Y yo que estoy aqui, sentado frente a ti

E aprendi al filo ogni speranza mia
Io non avrei creduto mai di poter perder la testa, per te
All'improvviso sei fuggito via
Lasciando il vuoto in questa vita mia
Senza risposte ai miei perché adesso cosa mi resta di te

Non c'è non c'è il profumo della tua pelle
Non c'è il respiro di te sul viso
Non c'è la tua bocca di fragola
Non c'è il dolce miele dei tuoi capelli
Non c'è che il veleno di te sul cuore

Incatenata a notte di follia
Anche in prigione me ne andrai per te
Solo una vita non basta per me
E anche l'estate ha le sue nuvole
E tu sei l'uragano contro me

In questa vita buia senza di te sento che
Ormai per me sei diventato l'unica ragione
Se c'è un confine nell'amore giuro lo passerò
E nell'imenso vuoto di quei giorni senza fine ti amerò

Deixa cair o seu véu sobre nós
Ó lua bonita no céu
Molha o nosso amor

Vem comigo
Vai sem medo
De se arrepender
Você deve acreditar
No que eu digo
Pode ir fundo
Isso é que é viver

How I wish that the world could be smaller today

How can I survive without your touch

Sandy & Júnior,"Quando eu te vi
Na minha frente
Vi que o amor
É tão diferente
Eu inocente caí sem querer
Foi de repente
Nem deu pra perceber

Eu acho que pirei
Meus pés saíram do chão
Eu posso até voar
Segura o meu coração
Até me belisquei
Será que é ilusão
O que eu senti não dá 
Pra explicar ou cantar numa canção

É o amor que eu sempre sonhei

Saturday night and the moon is out. 
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout,
find a two-step partner and a cajun beat, 
when it lifts me up, I'm gonna find my feet
out in the middle of a big dance floor.
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more.
Wanna dance to a band from a Lousian' tonight.
 
And I never have wandered down to New Orleans,
never have drifted down a bayou stream.
But I heard that music on the radio,
and I swore someday I was gonna go:
down a highway 10 past Lafayett;
there's a Baton Rouge.
and I won't forget to send you a card with my regrets
'cause I'm never gonna come back home.

Hey!
 
They gotta alligator stew and a crawfish pie,
a gulf storm blowin' into town tonight.
Livin' on the delta it's quite a show.
They got hurricane parties ev'ry time it blows.
But here up north it's a cold, cold rain,
and there ain't no cure for my blues today; 
except when the paper says
Beousoleil is a comin' into town.

Bring your mama, bring your papa, bring you sister too.
They got lots of music and lots of room.
When they play you a waltz form a nineteen ten, 
you're gonna fell a little bit young again.
Well you learn to dance with you rockin' roll,
you learn to swing with do-si-do.
But you learn to love at the fais do

Is wonderful, wonderful

Sandy Denny,"The wine it was drunk, the ship it was sunk,
The shot it was dead, all the sorrows were drowned.
The birds they were clouds, the brides and the shrouds
And as we drew south the mist it came down.

The wooded ravine to the wandering stream,
The serpent he moved, but no-one would say.
The depths of the waters, the bridge which distraught us
And brought to me thoughts of the ill-fated day.

The temples were filled with the strangest of creatures
One played it by ear on the banks of the sea.
That one was found but the others they went under.
Oh the tears which are shed, they won't come from me.

The methods of madness, the pathos and the sadness,
God help you all, the insane and wise.
The black and the white, the darkness of the night,
I see only smoke from the chimneys arise.

He flew solo on the mercury sea.

Sandy Denny,"One evening fair I took the air
Down by Blackwaterside
'Twas gazing all around me
When the Irish lad I spied

All through the first part of that night
We did lie in sport and play,
When this young man arose and he gathered his clothes,
Saying, ""Fare thee well today"".

That's not the promise that you gave to me
When the first you lay on my breast,
You could make me believe with your lying tongue
That the sun rose in the west.

Go home, go home, to your father's garden
Go home and weep your fill,
And think upon your own misfortune
Which you bought with your wanton will.

There's not one girl in this whole town
As easily led as I,
And when the sky does fall and the seas will run dry,
Why, it's then you'll marry I.",Blackwaterside

Wherever I should chance to go"",

As I wander to and fro,
Sad would be your day.

Till the guns they did go through me,
So now I shall never fall.

Upon the plains of war.
I shall destroy them all.""

Before the evening of their span of days,

Sandy Denny,"Then came the question and it was about time.
The answer came back and it was long.
The house it was built by some man in a rhyme,
But whatever came of his talented son?
Who wrote me a dialogue set to a tune?
Always you told me of being alone,
Except for the stories about God and you,
And do you still live there in Buffalo?

They put up the walls with no more to say,
Nobody stopped to ask why it was done.
The stream was too far and the rain was too high,
So into the city the river did run.
Because of the architect the buildings fell down,
Smothered or drowned all the seeds which were sown.
I wish I were somewhere, but not in this town.
Maybe the ocean next time around.

I seem to remember the face and the name,
But if it's not you I won't care.
I know of changes, but nothing would change you
To Theo the sailor who sings in his lair.
And then I'll turn and he won't be there,
Dusky black windows to light the dark stair,
Candles all gnarled in the musty air
All without flames for many's the year.",Next Time Around
Sandy Denny,"The steps he took were nice and easy.
He never knew he could stumble and go down.
As he saw the buildings and the mountains crumble,
Over the road he would take to the town.
He said, ""Next year I'm coming back, I'll see you later.""
It takes longer when you're far away.

There's a tale which says he was pursued by an assassin.
What he knows of that, no-one can tell.
How close he came to the trapper,
But he stopped by a wishing well.
He said, ""Next year there will be many flowers,
Each one much brighter than the one before.""

As he turned he caught the feeling,
And he smiled as he walked down the road.
All my days they are filled with meaning,
But I have yet to fathom the code.
But next year I'll call the tune and it won't be easy,
The timing's all out of place with how you feel.

Next year I'm coming back, I'll see you later.

Sandy Denny,"To cross the wide sea I deserted,
From the shore I did fly.
I thought it time that I travelled,
So I took to the roads of the sky.

It was late and the wind it did gently blow,
Oh the night it was calm.
I saw the flower of the ocean
And the universe did me noo harm,
It said to fly on.

The sea captain he loved the ocean,
But his ship was on fire.
His hands they did stretch out before him,
For to take one of many desires,
But there was no time.

He thought it time that he travelled
And I saw him as he passed by,
And I saw him as he passed by.",The Sea Captain
Sandy Denny,"The summer was the reason
Why it took so long to see
That even if I do possess
Some seeds of honesty,
There is no garden,
So how come I have no land?
I shall be waiting here awhile
To see what comes to hand.

Misers mise and compromise;
I know what I have seen.
The wanderers are in the east;
That's where I should have been.
But I did not go there;
I couldn't find the way.
I do believe I made a try,
But I really couldn't say.

Oh, that wretched Wilbur,
He keeps ploughing up the land.
He fights the battle thoughtfully
With roses in his hands.

I'm walking the floor over you,
I can't sleep a wink that is true.
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two,

Now darling you know I love you well,
I love you more than I can ever tell,
I thought that you wanted me and always would be mine,
But you went and left me here with troubled mind.

Walking the floor is good for you.
Just keep right on walking and it won't hurt you to cry,
Remember that I love you and I will until I die.

Those cheats who would take us to war again, so long.

With bride and bridesmaidens she made a fine show.
And I followed on with my heart full of woe
For she's gone and she's wed another.

Oh, when that I saw my love in the church stand,
With the ring on her finger and the glove in her hand,
I jumped in betwixt them and kissed the false bride,
Saying: ""Adieu to false loves for ever.""

With the bridesmen and bridesmaids they made a fine show,
Then I followed after with my heart full of woe,
For I was the man that ought to had her.
Oh, when that I saw my love sat down to meat,
I sat myself by her but nothing could eat.
I thought her sweet company better than wine,
Although she was wed to some other.

I saw my love as she sat doon to dine.
I sat doon beside her and poured the wine.
And I thought of the lassie that should have been mine,
Now she's gone and she's wed another.

And cover it over with wee flowers sae sweet.
And I lay me doon for to tak' a long sleep

And strew it all over with flowers so sweet,
That I may lay down there and take my long sleep,

It happens every time

I've been let down,
I've been turned 'round
When will I be loved?

When I meet a new boy
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time

I've been cheated,
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?
When will I be loved?
When will I be loved?",When Will I Be Loved?
Sandy Denny,"I know a cat named way out Willie
He got a cool little chick named rockin' Millie
He can dance and stroll and Susie-Q
Do that crazy hand jive too

Papa told Willie you'll ruin my home
Say you and that hand jive just got to go
Willie told Papa don't put me down
Doing that hand jive all over town

[Chorus]
Hand jive
Hand jive
Doing that crazy hand jive

Mama, mama look at Uncle Joe
He's doing that hand jive with sister Flo
And grandma gave baby sister a dime
Do that hand jive just one more time

Doctor and a lawyer and an Indian chief
Lord, they all digging that crazy beat
Way out Willie gives them all a treat
Lord he's doing that hand jive with his feet

Willie and Lily got married last fall
They had a little Willie Junior, and that ain't all
The kid got famous in his crib, you see
Lord he's doing that hand jive on TV",Willie and the Hand Jive
Sandy Denny,"Oh, babe, you are the one I love,
You are the one I'm thinking of.
You know it's still a long long way,
But I'll be home at the end of the day.
I'll sing my songs just for you
And I'll bring my love home to you.
I can hardly wait to see your face again,
But I'll be home at the end of the day.
Just miles and miles of rosy sky,
I'll fall asleep by and by.
I'm crying now 'cause you're so far away
But I'll be home at the end of the day.
Oh, babe, you are the one I love,
You are the one I'm thinking of.
So many words I need to say.
You'll hear them all at the end of the day.
But I'll be home at the end of the day.",At the End of the Day
Sandy Denny,"The Summertime's escaping, and the carnival's away,
And the sunshine is awaiting for another sunny day.
Breakers whisper to the shells upon the shore,
And hear the seagulls they cry for more.
And hear the gulls they cry for more.
Good day to you sweet Autumn, so gently you appear.
Why I never even realized those rustic times were near.
The moment's changing from a dusty green to gold,
The Summer fair she has grown old.
The Summer fair she has grown old.
And away in the blue of the skies and over the trees
How the carnival flies on the wings of a breeze.
You've had your time and now it's mine for me to go,
These colder days they move too slow.
These older days they move too slow.
So the Summertime is leaving, and the carnival's away,
So the sunshine is relieving us of all our sunny days.
But I'll be waiting for to greet your fleeting calls,
So come back soon the carnival.
So come back soon the carnival.
Come back soon.",Carnival
Sandy Denny,"Roses are red, and violets are blue,
Primroses pale on a velvet green hue,
Warm summer days by cool waterfalls,
Like the music we hear,
Those things we'll always hold dear,
Like an old fashioned waltz.
When the moonlight shines down
On the Hollywood world,
And the heroine waits 
For her beau to return,
And violins play 
From behind garden walls,
How I'd love to remain 
With the silver refrain
Of an old fashioned waltz.

As they dance round the floor,
And there's no-one else there,
And the world is no more 
And there's never a care,
By the perfect lagoon 
Where the nightingale calls,
With only the moon 
And the nostalgic tune
Of an old fashioned waltz.

Roses are red and violets are blue,
Primroses pale on a velvet green hue,
Warm summer days by cool waterfalls,
Like the music we hear,
Those things we'll always hold dear,
Like an old fashioned waltz,
Like an old fashioned waltz,
An old fashioned waltz.",Like an Old Fashioned Waltz
Sandy Denny,"I'd work for you, I'd even slave for you,
I'd be a beggar or a knave for you.
And if that isn't love it'll have to do,
Until the real thing comes along.

I'd gladly move the earth for you,
To prove my love dear and its worth for you.
And if that isn't love it'll have to do,
Until the real thing comes along.

With all the words dear at my command,
I just can't make you understand.
I'll always love you darling, come what may,
My heart is yours, what more can I say.

I'd sigh for you, I'd cry for you,
I'd tear the stars down from the sky for you.
And if that isn't love it'll have to do,
Until the real thing comes along.

Sandy Denny,"We search for everything
Keeping what we would win
Orchids or tiny flowers
Wooden huts or ivory towers
Centuries or hours

Dark are the winter days
Holy in many ways
Vaults of time unshaken
Whilst as through them we are taken
Sleeping forests wake
Ice melts on the lake
Birds begin in making their way back home

The frost and the fire goes
East winds and winter snows
Sun upon the daffodils
Dancing on the verdant hills
Lambs in the fields

Warmer grows the morning sun
Days of youthfulness and fun
The prime of the year begun
The song of summer to be sung
Everything is one
Working day is done
Watch the river running through our lives

How slowly the colors change
We feel the drops of rain
Mists of evening rise again
We rarely stroll the shadowed lanes
As autumn night draws in

We sit upon the sand
Warmth draining from the land
Watching the ruby sun
Setting on the ocean
The echoes in the caves
The flame upon the waves
Memories for saving all our days",All Our Days
Sandy Denny,"Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

[Chorus: x2]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Chorus]

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

[Chorus]

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than just sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

[Chorus]",Candle in the Wind
Sandy Denny,"If your eyes are blue you know the rest
Champagne if it's very cool
It's never very formal how you dress
For oysters by the swimming pool
Then slip away into the mountainside
Like the man in the Lazy E'
It's great to have a place where you can hide
Why you must amazes me

[Chorus]
Golden,
Where are you?
Sold on gold dust

I shuttled all around America
From New York to Los Angeles
Nervous breakdown later, there we were
From Liberty to redwood trees
A friend of mine, she hitched from east to west
In time to hear my final song
It seems to me she tried her very best
She is a good companion

[Chorus]

He stores away the moments of her smiles
As if they were rare butterflies
Stalks his prey for miles and miles and miles
Then barters for the merchandise
When Life it drags the likes of me around
Just when we need some time alone
You have a simple mansion underground
Without address or telephone

[Chorus]",Gold Dust
Sandy Denny,"It seems like a lifetime since I saw you
Lover lover I've been away too long
When I see lovers holdings hands and sighing
I hang my head for shame of doing wrong

Bus wheels spinning, song birds singing break my heart
Take me back to old remembered days
Remind me of the times we spent together
Times before we went our separate ways
I wish I was a fool for you
I wish I was a fool for you
I wish I was a fool for you again

I'm sorry for the things I've said, the things I've done
I'm sorry for the restless thief I've been
Please don't make me pay for my deceiving heart

Sandy Denny,"Here comes the morning how it pleases
It always brings me something new
Its golden light will wash away the dust of yesterday
If I try it may let me forget you

And when these winter days are over
I mean to set myself upon my feet
I see me as something that I have never been
And I'll pick up the pieces that will make the girl complete

I'll be smiling all the time at everybody
My friends will tell me I'm just not the same
I won't linger over any tragedies that were
And I won't be singing any more sad refrains",No More Sad Refrains
Sandy Denny,"I don't want your lonely mansion
With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you've promised
Beneath the halo moon

But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrows
While you play your cheatin' game

Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind

You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I ain't never was that kind

Look around, these are troublesome times
The sun beats down on our hunger and thirst
It would soon all be over if we let it be worse

Take me away, take me away
Take me away, take me away

If not for you how would I keep going
No one to be near, no good fortune to know
Take my hand, make me feel stronger
You're a man - progress is slow

There will be rain clouds, for harvest to grow
We'll find the rain clouds, and the rivers will flow
Leave what is past, search for the future
Leave this black dream for it's high time to go

Sandy Denny,"Love is a mist that's turning everything red to white
Like the full moon it send you out of your mind at night
Wishing wells ain't no use, they just say may or might.

And all I need
Well all I need is you
Somehow it just grew and grew 
Till all I need is you.

Cats have got eyes that seem to follow me where I go
Purple and green, they seem to know everything I know
Be it all the feelings I just didn't want to show.

And all I need
Well all I need is you
Somehow it just grew and grew 
Till all I need is you
All I need is you,
Yes all I need is you.

Caught my mind suddenly just drifting out the door
Saw all my lifetime passing, feeling so insecure
You knew for certain, but I just didn't know for sure.

And all I need

Sandy Denny,"I wish I knew you were to stay
I know too well why I feel this way
It's just that I can plainly see
That I need you and you need me.

I'll stay with you while the days go past
Live for today, try and forget the past
My friends all say and I agree
That I need you and you need me.

I'd like to say it isn't true
But all of me must lie with you.
Sometimes I say how can it be
That I need you and you need me.

Do you recall what I said before
I meant it then, now I mean it more
I'd like somehow to make you see
That I need you and you need me.

That I need you and you need me.",And You Need Me

Half a bitter for the vicar
He's here to save your soul
He's looking fat and jovial
Though he's nearly on the dole
Anne Riley cooks his dinner
She keeps him washed and fed
She doesn't need much prompting
To jump into his bed.

And they all think they're so grand
Yes, they all think they're so grand
Yes, they all think they're so grand
But they're not
Oh no they're not.

Dr. Watson drinks large whiskies
He's nearly always high
He supplements his income
Aborting on the sly
Mrs. Thompson is an angel
In the W.V.S.
Her meals on wheels are very cheap
And she cooks the books for less.

Sammy Cohen is the bookie
Sitting over there
Drinking three star brandy
He doesn't seem to care
No-one wants to know him
They say he's been inside
They say his dear old mother
Committed suicide.

Dr. Watson charged Anne Riley
A fifty guinea fee
For Mr. Thompson's peace of mind
As far as I can see
Mrs. Thompson envies Annie
Cooking for the preacher
And everyone thinks Sam 
Is a quite disgusting creature
But if the truth was known
It would shake all their foundations
It seems the preacher lives
On Sam's anonymous donations.

I'll make sure I'm out the next time you call
I know that something always turns up in the end
I've been my own worst friend.

I was blind, you were kind
Now I find that I was shy

I've got no friends to turn to
When I am feeling low

I'd like to leave the world behind
And try and start anew.

Nothing else will do, babe

All I ever wanted
Was a place to call my own
A place that's quiet and peaceful
Where I can feel so all alone

And he was my friend
At school we were always close together

With no-one to talk to at all
He'd walk in the park till the evening grew dark

Around about five
When along came a lady, a total stranger
Wanted young Jimmy to go with her

I've often gazed into my crystal ball
To find out if you think of me at all
But there's no reason why
You should even try
For there's nothing I can give as you can see
If you stay awhile with me.

Stay awhile with me
And I will show you I'm true

The charcoal branches lean against the rosy sky,
You are so far away, yet I could touch you if I may,
But don't you worry now, I'm only dreaming anyway.

You may be lonely, you may be just on your own.
You could be anywhere, someplace that I have known.
But who am I and do we really live these days at all?
And are they simply feelings we have loved and do recall?

Oh the sea has made me cry,
But I love her, too, so maybe I love you.

For tears are only made of salt and water,
And across the waves the sound of laughter.
October it has gone and left me with a song
That I will sing to you although the moment may be wrong.

Could it be the sea's as real as you and I?
I often wonder why I always have to say
I'm only dreaming anyway.

Oh Willie, dearest Willie, don't leave me here to mourn,
Don't make me curse and rue the day that ever I was born.
For the parting of our love would be like parting with my life.
So stay at home, my dearest love, and I will be your wife.

Oh my Nancy, dearest Nancy, sure that will never do.

The government has ordered, and the Queen she gives command.
And I am bound on oath, my love, to serve in a foreign land.

I'll dress myself in uniform, and I'll see Egypt too.
I'll march beneath your banner while fortune it do smile,
And we'll comfort one another on the banks of the Nile.

But your waist it is too slender, and your fingers they are too small.
In the sultry suns of Egypt your rosy cheeks would spoil.
Where the cannons they do rattle, when the bullets they do fly,
And the silver trumpets sound so loud to hide the dismal cries.

Oh, cursed be those cruel wars, that ever they began,
For they have robbed our country of manys the handsome men.
They've robbed us of our sweethearts while their bodies they feed the lions,

By the time it gets dark.

We could go walking out in the sunshine
Look at all the people out in the street
Hurrying away to a business luncheon
Waiting for a taxi for aching feet.

Light up your face, baby, let's get going
Want to see a change in those weary eyes
We'll have some fun, take a boat out rowing
Why on earth should life be so serious?

For they loathe me, ev'ryone.

And will you never cut the cloth
Or drink the light to be?
And can you never swear a year
To anyone but me?

No I will never cut the cloth

'Til you've lost everything but what money can own.
And you feel alright now, but for how long?
You feel alright now, how long?
Do me a favour, stay away from my door.
I could use some good company but I don't care for yours.
No more pageants, no more.
No more pageants, no more.
I find your words empty and you know as a rule
To you I have purposefully never been cruel.
But you waste my time, such fools.
You waste my time, such fools.
My love is not here, my love is away.
You've caught me alone but you've nothing to say.
And it's time to leave now and you know the way.
And it's time to leave and you know the way.

Sandy Denny,"Everybody else has gone,
But you're still here with me.
All the world is sleeping by and by.
Through the windowpane
The frosted light is streaming in,
Full moon sailing high across the sky.
Tonight is like the night when we first met.
I always knew I never would forget you.

Come and hold me close,
I miss you more than I can say.
I can't remember how I pass the time (with you away),
Wondering if you'll ever know
How much you mean to me.
I never dreamed there'd be a change of mind.
Lover, this is where I want to stay.
Maybe it could always be this way.

I recall you said to me
A long, long time ago,
?Don't you lose direction in the crowd (I think you could).?
But when I did you found me
And I didn't even know.
I hardly even knew you were around and understood.
I was reaching out each moment to be free.
You were all those things I'd never be.

Gentle music, rock away the sadnesses in me.
Rock away my lonely yesterdays,
Like pennies on the ocean

'Til moonlight shows no ripples on the waves.
And then the clear reflection will remain.
Perhaps the same reflection
Of that same full moon.",Full Moon
Sandy Denny,"You make me nervous when I see you.
I can't imagine what it's like to be you.

It's my imagination when I get low,
And the truth is I don't think I'll ever go.

When the music's playing, that's when it changes,
And no longer do we seen like total strangers.
It's all those words which always get in the way
Of what you want to say.

When I wake up in the morning
I think it only fair to give you warning
I probably won't go away,
I'll more than likely stay.

[Chorus]",I'm a Dreamer
Sandy Denny,"The lady she had a silver tongue.
For to sing she said,
And maybe that's all.
Wait for the dawn and we will have that song.
When it ends it will seem
That we hear silence fall.

The lady she had a golden heart,
For to love, she said
And she did not lie.
Wait for the dawn and we'll watch for the sun.
As we turn it will seem
To arise in the sky.

We heard that song while watching the skies,
Oh the sound it rang
So clear through the cold.
Then silence fell and the sun did arise
On a beautiful morning of silver and gold.",The Lady
Sandy Denny,"Long distance information, give me Memphis Tennessee
Help me find a party that tried to get in touch with me
She could not leave a number but I know who placed the call
'cause my uncle took a message and he wrote it on the wall

Help me, information, get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd call me here from Memphis Tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high upon a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi bridge

Last time I saw Marie she was waving me goodbye
With ""hurry-home"" drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee

Help me, information, more than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
Marie is only six years old, information please 
Try to put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee",Memphis
Sandy Denny,"Calling all olive branches and laid-off doves
There is work to do before we say good-bye.
But who can see them turning to the face of love?
Though I hear them pleading with me, ""Don't let us die,""
As I sit, I can see their troubled souls wander by,
And I feel them leaning on my shoulder to cry,
""Oh, oh one more chance.""

The naked tree of winter seems to stand so proud,
Lording the poor mortal as he goes.
And the tears which well beneath his sombre shroud,
Will they fall with the shame of somebody who knows
He can never be like the thought of a rose
Whose beauty remains even though the bloom goes?
""Oh, oh one more chance.""

Oh is it too late to change the way we're bound to go?
Is it too late? 
Then surely one of us must know.

God bless the poor ones who have none though they have tried.

Someone is drowning down there in the flood
But this river will dry by tomorrow.
Is it ocean or stream, this love in my blood,
Bringer of joy or of sorrow?
The end of the journey must soon be in sight,
Birth is the start of the swansong.
Oasis of love, sweet water of life,
God bless the poor ones who want some but are denied.

All we can do is to trace it.
See where we go to,
Know where we've been,
Build up the courage to face it
While we fumble in the darkness where once there was light
Roaming the land of the ancients.
Oasis of love, sweet water of life,
God bless the poor ones whose patience never died.

While we stumble in blindness where once there was sight
Searching for trees in the forest.
Oasis of love, sweet water of life,

Sandy Denny,"As gentle tides go rolling by,
Along the salt sea strand
The colours blend and roll as one
Together in the sand.
And often do the winds entwine
Do send their distant call,
The quiet joys of brotherhood,
And love is lord of all.

The oak and weed together rise,
Along the common ground.
The mare and stallion light and dark
Have thunder in their sound.
The rainbow sign, the blended flower
Still have my heart in thrall.
The quiet joys of brotherhood,
And love is lord of all.

But man has come to plough the tide,
The oak lies on the ground.
I hear their tires in the fields,
They drive the stallion down.
The roses bleed both light and dark,
The winds do seldom call.

When love was lord of all.",The Quiet Joys of Brotherhood

There's nothing between you and me
I'll take a boat down the river my love
And sail away to the sea
I'll sail away to the sea.

What will you take to remember me by
I've no money to buy you a smile
I can't say the words to bid you farewell
So I'll carry them with me a while.

Right now I think the things you say
Are liable to confuse.

I've just gone solo.
Do you play solo?
Ain't life a solo?
What a wonderful way to live,

She's traveling all over the world.
Why, the fame and all the golden

No time for the gent with the Mulliner Bentley

And heaven knows what else.
Why, he wouldn't even stand a chance
With all his oil-wells.

Do you play solo?
Ain't life a solo?
I've always lived in a mansion
On the other side of the moon.

I've always kept a unicorn
And I never sing out of tune.
I could tell you that the grass is really greener
On the other side of the hill,

But I can't communicate with you
And I guess I never will.
We've all gone solo.
We all play solo.

Sandy Denny,"He was a stranger to himself,
A spy in his own camp,
And his money was his health,
All thrown to the dust by his very own hand.

Yet his beauty lingered still,
Beyond the draining of the sand,
But greener was the other side of the hill,
Richer was the other man's land.

But we loved him, loved him just like brothers would.
We loved him, loved him like no others could,
And she loved him, loved him like a lover should.

Take good care of an aching heart,
You never can replace it.
You know you are the master of your art,
You'll realise that when you think it fit.

Those orbs of blue are jading away,
No laughter from these dances.
Yet you're bound to remember this one day,
Hazards are risks, and risks are chances.

You can run for cover, run for cover like a frightened hare,
Till it's all over, all over and there's no-one there,
'Cause you daren't discover, daren't discover that we really care.",Stranger to Himself
Sandy Denny,"I sit and wonder at the thought
That someday you'll be going
At the same time I realize
I must not be afraid
You are the one I love
You are the one I touch
And it's you who must not go
But it's I who must try not
To send you away.

Out of my door and along the path
Where I have never travelled
Could it be that you would help me
Out along that road?
I only want your hand
I only want your smile
From you that is everything
From you that is all I need
To take away the load.",Take Away the Load (Sandy's Song)
Sandy Denny,"""I forbid you maidens all that wear gold in your hair
To travel to Carterhaugh, for young Tam Lin is there

None that go by Carterhaugh but they leave him a pledge
Either their mantles of green or else their maidenhead""

Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee
And she's gone to Carterhaugh as fast as go can she

She'd not pulled a double rose, a rose but only two
When up then came young Tam Lin, says,""Lady, pull no more""

""And why come you to Carterhaugh without command from me?""
""I'll come and go,"" young Janet said, ""and ask no leave of thee""

Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee
And she's gone to her father as fast as go can she

Well, up then spoke her father dear and he spoke meek and mild
""Oh, and alas, Janet,"" he said, ""I think you go with child""

""Well, if that be so,"" Janet said, ""myself shall bear the blame
There's not a knight in all your hall shall get the baby's name

For if my love were an earthly knight, as he is an elfin grey
I'd not change my own true love for any knight you have""

So Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee
And she's gone to Carterhaugh as fast as go can she

""Oh, tell to me, Tam Lin,"" she said, ""why came you here to dwell?""
""The Queen of Fairies caught me when from my horse I fell

And at the end of seven years she pays a tithe to hell
I so fair and full of flesh and fear it be myself

But tonight is Halloween and the fairy folk ride
Those that would let true love win at Mile's Cross they must bide

So first let pass the horses black and then let pass the brown
Quickly run to the white steed and pull the rider down

For I'll ride on the white steed, the nearest to the town
For I was an earthly knight, they give me that renown

Oh, they will turn me in your arms to a newt or a snake
But hold me tight and fear not, I am your baby's father

And they will turn me in your arms into a lion bold
But hold me tight and fear not and you will love your child

And they will turn me in your arms into a naked knight
But cloak me in your mantle and keep me out of sight""

In the middle of the night she heard the bridle ring
She heeded what he did say and young Tam Lin did win

Then up spoke the Fairy Queen, an angry queen was she
Woe betide her ill-far'd face, an ill death may she die

""Oh, had I known, Tam Lin,"" she said, ""what this night I did see
I'd have looked him in the eyes and turned him to a tree""",Tam Lin
Sandy Denny,"If today was not an endless highway,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all.
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
And if I could hear his heart softly pounding,
Only if he was lying by me.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.

I can't see my reflection in the waters,
I can't speak the sounds that show no pain,
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps,
Or can't remember the sound of my own name.
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
And if I could hear his heart softly pounding,
Only if he was lying by me.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.

There's beauty in the silver, singing river,
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky,
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes.

And if I could hear his heart softly pounding,
Only if he was lying by me.

I can't sleep a wink that is true.
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two,
Walking the floor over you.

Now darling you know I love you well,
I love you more than I can ever tell,
I thought that you wanted me and always would be mine,
But you went and left me here with troubled mind.

Just keep right on walking and it won't hurt you to cry,
Remember that I love you and I will until I die.

I must be myself and I'll do alright.
Oh please my darling do not make me sad,
Late at night nobody really wants to feel that bad.

The rain it beats impatiently upon the window pane,
I must close my ears or I'll go insane.
Can't you be a gentle breeze or silent as a snowfall,
Won't you try and listen for the voice behind the wall.

It cries to you.

Even though it only ever whispers part of what it knows,
And it's never ventured through the locks,
Where the brazen river flows.
It's the fingerprint which is never made.
It's the perfume of a rose.

And it is there if you are searching,
But the moment must be right,
As the night is black, as the day is white.
Please my friend help to make me glad,
Help me find the one and only thing I've never had.

What is true?

Even though it only ever whispers part of what it knows,
And it's never ventured through the locks,
Where the brazen river flows.
It's the fingerprint which is never made.
It's the perfume of a rose.

The music still plays for her pleasure.
But the air is as cold as the death,
And the soft melodies only measure her bittersweet tears.

Every note of each song brings a vision
Of love and of pain back to me,
Like a captive I've locked in a prison
And whose liberty rests upon me.
But I can't find the key.
You may never be free.

The servants still hang on his every word,
But his youthfulness passes him by.

And they watching him see his sparkling eye 
Holds no diamond any more.

As we turn it will seem
To arise in the sky

Oh the sound it rang

Sandy Denny,"Come walk the streets of crime
And colour bright the corners
Of love with the earth

See the dazzling nightlife grow
Beyond the dawn and burning
In the heart of Soho

Hear the market cries
And see their wares displayed
Through the window of your soul

Come watch the naked dance
That spins before your very eyes
Naked like the sun

Step inside where men before
Have drunk to fill to senseless
Till the dreams fade and die

And free and easy
Does the blood red wine come flowing
From the glass to your veins

And the midday dream is silent
Thou gardens where you're resting
From the troubles of your mind

And though the sun is burning brightly
All within the gardens
Are the sleeping oris dead

And through the afternoon
The buzzing bees do harmonise
Through the rushing sale daylight",Soho
Sandy Denny,"Good morning, good afternoon
And what have you got to say?
Well, I'm waiting and I can't stay long
It's such a lovely day

There's a time to be talking
And a time when it's no use
Right now I think the things you say
Are liable to confuse

I've just gone solo
Do you play solo?
Ain't life a solo?

What a wonderful way to live
Traveling all over the world
Why the fame and all the golden
Opportunities unfurled

No time for the gent with the Mulliner Bentley
And Heaven knows what else
Why, he wouldn't even stand a chance
With all his oil wells

She just went solo
Do you play solo?
Ain't life a solo?

I've always lived in a mansion
On the other side of the moon
I've always kept a unicorn
And I never sing out of tune

I could tell you that the grass is really greener
On the other side of the hill
But I can't communicate with you
And I guess I never will

We've all, all gone solo
We all play solo
Ain't life, life a solo?

To prove my love dear and its worth for you
And if that isn't love it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along
With all the words dear at my command
I just can't make you understand

I'll always love you darling, come what may
My heart is yours, what more can I say
I'd sigh for you, I'd cry for you
I'd tear the stars down from the sky fo you

I can't imagine what it's like to be you.

For the race they put on over in Kentucky.
It's lovely at this time of year, so they say,
And I've got to get away.

I'm a dreamer, and you know
I'm a schemer with an eye for a show.
It's my imagination when I get low,
And the truth is I don't think I'll ever go.

When the music's playing, that's when it changes,
And no longer do we seen like total strangers.
It's all those words which always get in the way
Of what you want to say.

I think it only fair to give you warning
I probably won't go away,
I'll more than likely stay.

Wherever I should chance to go

As I wander to and fro,
Sad would be your day.

Till the guns they did go through me,
So now I shall never fall.

Upon the plains of war.
I shall destroy them all.'

Sandy Dirt,"We met at the broken spoke restaurant and lounge
I lit your cigarette and then you wrote your number down
On the inside of a matchbook that was laying on the bar
And a fire started burning somewhere in my heart

I didn't see it coming, guess I didn't read the signs
I just never thought you'd leave me after all this time
But today when I came home my key was hollow in the door
And there was nothing but a worn out book of matches on the floor

You took the bed
You took the dishes and the car
You broke my trust
You took advantage of my heart
You left me here
With empty rooms and walls with holes and scars and scratches
If I find the strength to burn you memories down
At least you left the matches

The color's old and faded the cover's worn and stained
But i can still make out the numbers and the heart beside your name
Until tonight they'd only lit a single cigarette
Now one by one I'm striking them to help me to forget

And everybody at the broken spoke
All thought my crazy story was a joke
Now they're out there in the parking lot
Staring at the smoke

You took the bed
You took the dishes and the car
You broke my trust
You took advantage of my heart
You left me here
With empty rooms and walls with holes and scars and scratches
And the hurt I need to burn those memories down
At least you left the matches

Baby all that's left of our love now is ashes
Thank God you left the matches",Matches

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

You are my pretty Fraulein
 
When my memories wander
Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me
The face of my pretty Fraulein

Walk down by the river
Pretend that your hand's holding mine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you

Sandy Nelson,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
And you left me here on the wild side of life",The Wild Side of Life

Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,

And never tilts at all

Sure plays a mean pinball.

I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

He can beat the best.

Sandy Wilson,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture

Sandy Zacky,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

Sandy Zacky,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me

Sanford & Townsend,"You left me here on
You're way, to paradise.
You pulled the rug, right out
From under my life.
I know where go, so I knew when
You came home last night.

Cause you're eyes had a mist
From the smoke of a distant fire.

Lord I was stung,
Should've seen it come a long time ago
When I realized the reality gave me a roll
If things are the same
Then explain why your kiss is so cold
And that mist in your eyes
Feels like rain on the fire
In my soul

This lying, and crying and setting
And get in the way
It dont stack up so slack up
And pack up I just dont care
(Dont let the screen door hit you)
On your way out
(Dont try to dream when your dream runs into the ground)

I'd just like to know
Do you love him or just making time
My feeling is glass when you're fast
Throwing bitter sweet lines
He'll face the aftertaste
When you come home late some night

With your eyes all a mist
From the smoke of a distant fire

Girl your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire
(Girl your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire)x2

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

Don't get around much anymore

Sani,"No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I am the king of time
I am off the edge of sanity
My living ain't no crime
A soldier of existence
Chosen to be
Protector of the earth
I'll last eternally
I awake into another sphere
Reborn into the neverwhere
All alone in this space
There's no love nor disgrace
My body aches, I tremble with fear
The sky, the last I saw is no longer clear
Water and ice cover the ground
I can face reality, the world has drowned
I try to move but I am caged in ice
Floating bodies looking for their paradise
But the truth is no longer fantasy
In this world I am the only man to be

I am lost, I was never created
I am lost, life is devastated

We melt away and I feel the mud
That once was land for all
The sea of ice that used to be
The home of humanity
My soul is frozen, longing for fire
I barely believe I see this sight
All I can face is eternal night.
The sun awakes and shine on all the remains
The ice that encaged my body now flows in strains
Soon I can move, and walk away
What the future brings, who can say?

[Chorus]

Eternal eyes, I can see the sky
My lonely cries, I want my soul to die
I am all alone, the world will now reform
I'm born again, once cold sun now keeps me warm

Or should I say she once had me

Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't

That was when you started to be cold
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find myself all alone

Avec tous ses coquillages
Ses îles parfumées
Et puis ses beaux naufrages
Et ses saumons fumés.

Au-dessus de la mer
Nous avons rencontré
La lune et les étoiles
Sur un bateau à voiles
Partant pour le Japon
Et les trois mousquetaires des cinq doigts de la main
Tournant la manivelle d'un petit sous-marin
Plongeant au fond des mers
Pour chercher des oursins.

Revenant sur la terre
Nous avons rencontré
Sur la voie de chemin de fer
Une maison qui fuyait
Fuyait tout autour de la terre
Fuyait tout autour de la mer
Fuyait devant l'hiver
Qui voulait l'attraper.

Mais nous sur notre chemin de fer
On s'est mis à rouler
Rouler rouler derrière l'hiver
Et on l'a écrasé
Et la maison s'est arrêtée
Et le printemps nous a salués.

C'était lui le garde-barrière.
Il nous a bien remerciés
Et toutes les fleurs de toute la terre
Soudain se sont mises à pousser
Pousser à tort et à travers

De peur de les abîmer.

Lui apportait de belles roses blanches,
Au lieu de s'acheter des joujoux
La câlinant bien tendrement,
Il disait en les lui donnant

Voici des roses blanches, toi qui les aimais tant
Va quand je serai grand, j´achèterai au marchand

Un matin d´avril parmi les promeneurs
N´ayant plus un sous dans sa poche
Sur un marché tout tremblant le pauvre mioche,
Furtivement vola quelques fleurs

En baissant la tête, il lui dit

""C´est aujourd´hui dimanche et j´allais voir maman
J´ai pris ces roses blanches elle les aime tant
Sur son petit lit blanc, là-bas elle m´attend
J´ai pris ces roses blanches, pour ma jolie maman""

""Emporte-les je te les donne""

Puis à l´hôpital il vint en courant,
Pour offrir les fleurs à sa mère

A l'âge où s'amuser tout seul ne suffit plus

D'affectueuses révérences

Tantôt venant d'Espagne, tantôt d'Italie

Sur mon dernier sommeil verseront les échos
De villanelle, un jour, un jour de fandango
De tarentelle, de sardane

Et quand prenant ma butte en guise d'oreiller
Une ondine viendra gentiment sommeiller

But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season.
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from last year.
Ski shop encounter most interesting.

Most of '81 passed along those lines.
So deck those halls. Trim those trees.

Chill this room for twenty-four days.

Would have been good to go for lunch.

We tried, we said we'd keep in touch.
Didn't of course 'till summer time,
Out to the beach to his boat.
Could I join him?
No. This time it was me;

'Cause I bundled up too tight.
Last minute have-to-dos:
A few cards, a few calls
Because it's RSVP.
No, thanks. No party lights.
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax,
Turn down all of my invites.
Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called; Halloween party.
Waited all night for him to show.
This time his car wouldn't go.
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late.
Trudge on home to celebrate.
In a quiet way unwind.
Doing Christmas right this time.

And he has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey.
Already in the oven, nice and hot.
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot.
So on with the boots
Back out in the snow
To the only all night grocery.
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year.
'Spending this one alone,' he said.
'Give me a break, this year's been crazy.'
I said 'Me too, but why are you..
You mean you forgot cranberries too?'
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed.
Caught on to what was happening.
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending.

Brillante tu anillito, te pasaste de la cuenta
Muy fan si tu relojito es de town town no me mientas
Tu vida se ve obscura sin el brillo en la moneda
Nada nada se te luce si no es nuevo de la tienda
y yo que tengo poquito me alcanza para la fiesta, me río y no necesito

Ni millones, ni pantalones de piel que cuesten mas que la quincena, eso trae problemas 
No quiero ni mansiones, ni vacaciones bebiendo en alta mar
eso trae problemas, eso no cura la pena.

Yo tengo una casa humilde
pero llena de esperanza.
Yo tengo una bicicleta que me lleva a donde vaya.
La luna es mi compañera cuando las luces se apagan
el sol brilla mas que el oro cuando abro mi ventana...soy libre y no necesito

Ni millones, ni pantalones de piel que cuesten mas que la quincena, eso trae problemas. 
No quiero ni mansiones, ni vacaciones bebiendo en alta mar
eso trae problemas, eso no cura la pena.

Las numbers despertaron con mal humor

Con el corazón en mano
Por que ya no es justo nada
En la tierra que habitamos
En medio de la comparsa
Nos arrastra un viento humano
Pa' ver si se nos quitaba

Unos de tanta culpa se quedan mudos
Otros tienen memoria para olvidar

Si la violencia es un espejo que se rompe
Y nuestras lagrimas caidas gritaran
Solo recuerda que mi cara tiene un nombre
Y nunca mas se callara

Y nunca mas se callara

Te pido me des la mano
Y en el camino me sigas
Vamos demostrarle a los de arriba
La ira de los de abajo
Del miedo sepultado
Es hora de ser valiente
En honor a los ausentes
Ya no me cruzo de brazos

Santa Esmeralda,"There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun,
And it's been the ruin for many a poor boy,
And God, I know I'm one.

My mother was a tailor,
Sewed my new blue jeans.
My father was a gambling' man
Down in New Orleans.

Now, the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk,
And the only time he'll be satisfied
Is when he's all drunk.

Oh, Mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done,
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the house of the Rising Sun.

Well, I've got one foot on the platform,
The other foot on the train.
I'm going back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain.

Santa Esmeralda,"This happened once before,
When I came to your door, no reply.
They said it wasn't you,
But I saw you peep through your window,
I saw the light, I saw the light,
I know that you saw me,
'Cos I looked up to see your face.
I tried to telephone,
They said that you were not home, that's a lie,
'Cos I know where you've been,
I saw you walk in your door,
I mearly died, I nearly died,
'Cos you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place.
If I were you I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy,
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply.

Santa Esmeralda,"Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there
She would merengue and do the cha-cha
And while she tried to be a star
Tony always tended bar
Across the crowded floor, they worked from eight til four
They were young and they had each other
Who could ask for more?

[Chorus]
At the Copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana (here)
At the Copa (CO!) Copacabana
Music and passion were always in fashion
At the Copa, they fell in love

His name was Rico
He wore a diamond
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there
And when she finished,he called her over
But Rico went a bit to far
Tony sailed across the bar
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two
There was blood and a single gun shot
But just who shot who?

[Chorus]

At the Copa, she fell in love

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl,
But that was thirty years ago, when they used to have a show
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola,
Still in dress she used to wear,
Faded feathers in her hair
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony
Now she's lost her mind

Santana,"There's a mouse starin' out of the window
His car is trapped in the snow
He's planning a family vacation
But he just can't go
Around the next corner's a red bird
His feathers are trapped in a sling
He's passed by some gunslinging parrot
Who's jealous he ain't got no grin

There ain't no time to stash the gumbo
Or rattle around in a cage
The sacrificed child's made bubbles
And spittle is everywhere enraged
In a hot sand or in a my feet
They're blistered and caked with debris
Chez Rolez is guarding the tote board
While angry piddles with glee

There's a fool writing notes out on sandpaper
He's sending them off to himself
He gets them a couple days later
Who put them along his top shelf
If you get tired of shavings
And carve up a good hunk of wood
Remembering to check on the sausage
He's got cooking somewhere look good",Gumbo [Live][#][*]

There is a warm soft wind blowing 'round me just to give 
All the leaves such a haunting melody 
That forever will be a part of me 

Just like a ship out on the sea 
Floating alone no one around me or beyond me 
The sun is on me 

Then suddenly I felt a kiss out of the breeze 
That did caress me and possess me 
Oh it astounds me

That with the grace of time we'll be getting closer there 
But day by day I can see they walk away

She danced around and round to a guitar melody
From the fire her face was all aglow, how she enchanted me
Oh, how I'd like to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

I love you gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman

All through the caravan she was dancing all night
Waiting for the rising sun, everyone was having fun
I hate to see the lady go knowing she'll never know
I love her, that I love her

Tell me, are you tired gettin' down on the town

Stay at home, stay at home

Lady says she needs your love
It just can't come from up above
She doesn't want to be by herself
Says she wants you and no one else

Knows you bring home the bread
That's half the plan, stay and hold her hand
You being home is surely missed
All she wants is you to hug and kiss

All you got to do is start stay at home

Tell me, are you tired
Tell me, are you tired runnin' around
Tell me, are you tired
Tell me, are you tired runnin' around town

Tell me, are you tired
Tell me, are you tired playin' around town, town
Tell me, are you tired

Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?

A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

Your mind is getting dizzy
The spell is taking over

Suddenly you find yourself
Surrounded by these people
Ain't no use to try and struggle
You know it would be useless
Out of nowhere comes their leader
Commanding all attention
He signals them to set you free
But to keep on singing

When I needed a hand
Then it couldn't be found
I was so far down that I couldn't get up

Even my friends were my accusers
In my head I lost before I begun

I had a dream but it turned to dust
And what I thought was love
That must have been lust
I was living in style
When the walls fell in
And when I played my hand
I looked like a joker
Turn around fate must have woke her
'Cause lady luck she was waiting outside the door

I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
And I don't intend losing again

Too bad it belonged to me
It was the wrong time and not meant to be
It took a long time and I'm new born now
I can see the day that I bleed for
If it's agreed that there's a need
To play the game and to win again

I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
And I don't intend losing again

I had a dream but it turned to dust
And what I thought was love

That the surf had with the shore
Suddenly
I felt this emotion, of the sea

[Chorus]
Big Kahuna, tide was high
I began body surfing for my life

Ecstasy, sky and the sea
Embracing me
Golden sun on my face
Giving life to me

Unafraid I let go
Trusting in the deep blue sea
We became one with each other
Watching the tide as it drifts away

I spoke to me daddy
Said to me, son
You got to go find a job
And bring some money into the family
For your mommy and me

And body surf all day long

Open up your heart

Night is clear, moon is bright
Stars are shining everywhere
In my arms you'll be safe
There's no need to be afraid
It's a warm summer night
And the temperature is right
Let your hair hang low
Girl, I want to feel the flow
I've been waiting for so long
Now that I've got you
Ain't no way I'm gonna let you go

[Chorus]",Let Me Inside
Santana,"Drunk all the whiskey
But I still can't get no rest
Brain trapped on a roller coaster
Got a pain in my chest
Cold water on my eyeballs
Send a shiver up my spine
Hit the street in the wee wee hours
This is the night hunting time

[Chorus]
Don't know what I'm doing here
Don't know what I'm doing here
Got to get my senses clear

Stumble in off the footpath
Heard the sounds from below
Get accustomed to the darkness
Got to take it real slow
Sweat streamin' down my cheekbones
Smoke stingin' my eyes
Walls drippin' like the jungle
But this ain't no paradise

[Chorus]

Stumble up to the counter
Catch the tension in the air
Black Sabbath drive a young boy crazy
This ain't no frivolous affair
Young girl sipping Pernod
Budy hunger in her glance
No stoppin' when it comes to doin'
The Heavy Metal Romance

[Chorus]",Night Hunting Time
Santana,"Night ain't a friend
It's black and so still
It waits like a cat
Then moves in for the kill
It casts its shadows high on the wall
It's givin' me no peace at all
Now you're gone
The pain goes on
You're so deep into me
Now I'm begging you to
Set me free

[Chorus]
I've got nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
No way to stop
This hurt deep inside
That you gave to me
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to run

The sound of your voice
It comes in the night
It stays with me there
Until the light
When you say the words
That you said before

When you said you'd stay
You walked out the door
I can take the afternoon
But then comes the night
Instead I walk the floor
Till the light

[Chorus: x2]",Nowhere to Run
Santana,"When I was a young boy
I was raised in Africa
In a little village
Deep in the heart of Kenya
I remember one time
I was outside hunting game
When I heard the thunder
Of a storm that frightened me

Suddenly 
All around me darkness
And I could feel
Something evil near me
Closing in
So I started running
I tried to hide
But it overcame me

I became a prisoner of
The spell that entered me
And the same thing happened
To my friends and family
In the year that followed
Drought and famine filled the land
Many days of sorrow
Endless nights of burning pain

Suddenly
A light appeared before me
And I could see
The virgin shining on me
And in her arms
Was the child inside me
And I could feel 
Everlasting freedom all around me",Oxun (Oshún)
Santana,"What does it take
To win your love for me
How can I make
This dream come true for me
Ooh I just got to know
Oh baby cause I love you so

I tried I tried I tried I tried
Every way I could
To make you see how much I love you
I thought you understood

Oh, I gotta make you see
What does it take to win
Your love for me",What Does It Take (To Win Your Love)
Santana,"Standing in the valley of indecision
Trying to make some sense out of
A strange condition that we see
I've gotta find a way out 'cause
Nobody would listen 
So I turn my back and now I'm
On my way 

[Chorus]
Breaking out, I'm on my way 
Breaking out
Breaking out, I'm on my way 
Breaking out

I hear the things thy tell me but 
I don't believe it
Gotta find a place where I can 
Breathe and just be me
Gonna shake up the world 
Into a new position 
Now I'm letting you know that
I am on my way

[Chorus]

I can't stop this feeling deep 
Inside of me 
Now I finally see the reason 
Why
In my heart I know it's not 
Some fantasy
When I lift my eyes up to the 
Sky

It's a brand new day, but it 
Seems like an old one 
People playing games, but it's
No game I want to play 
They tried to hand me the dice 
But I know they were loaded 
So I turned my back and now 
I'm on my way 

[Chorus]",Breaking Out
Santana,"It's so hard just waitin' 
But I guess that's what I have to do 
My poor heart keeps on breakin' 
With every moment I'm away from you 
I know you're smart takin'
Your time 
'Cause of what it cost you 
Once before 
But it's not then and I love 
You a lot 
Now and forever 

[Chorus]
How long do I wait before you make up your mind 
How long I wonder 
How long before you take away the hardest of times 
How long I wonder 

It's unfair when two who care 
Have to face such a perilous sea 
Despair lingers everywhere 
Like a cloud nobody can reach 
I understand you're afraid of it all 
Love is one hell of a step 
I'll be there if you panic or fall 
No matter what the depth 

[Chorus]

All I can say I've already said 
More than a thousand times 
It's up to you to believe 
Every word 
Before I lose my mind 

[Chorus]",How Long
Santana,"[Chorus]
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you

Little girl again you are blue
Another fellow has gone and left you
I see you've come back to me
Your best friend
To tell another tragic story again
And once more you look into my eyes
And one more time you ought to realize

[Chorus]

I must confess you're not to be blamed
For being caught in those boys' vicious games
This time I won't let you go back
Never again, my dear, in fact
I'm gonna stop the blueness
In you
Also confess what my heart
Wants me to

I hear the echoes in my mind 
They're calling to me all the time

Too fast

And when the morning comes 
You take me by the hand 
And say our love is written in sand 
Written in sand 

We hear the ocean roar 
We're swept away on to some
Distant shore 
You whisper secrets of the heart 
They keep us close when the
World keeps us apart 

Until tomorrow comes 
Time is on our hands 
Because this love is written in

We go around again 'cause

Sometimes it only leaves us tired

What about the Constitution, freedom of expression
Listen to the music, just feel the sound

Way down south, talkin' 'bout Mexico

We'll fall in love in the middle of the night

Suits and ties with platinum eyes
Cold cash junkies got the best of me

Got myself back together
Learned my lesson well
I had to put up a fight, to make it right
Freedom's ringing like the sound of a bell

Staring from the bottom of his soul.
Watching the night come in from the window.

It'll all collapse tonight, the full moon is here again,
In sickness and in health, understanding so demanding,
It has no name, there's one for every season,
Makes him insane to know.

Running away from it all,
I'll be safe in the cornfields, he thinks, hunted by his own
Santana Full Moon Lyrics
Again he feels the moon rising on the sky

Find a barn to sleep in, but can he hide anymore
Someone's at the door, understanding, too demanding
Can this be wrong, it's love that is not ending
Makes him insane again

She should not lock the open door
Full moon is on the sky and he's not a man anymore
She sees the change in him, but can't
See what became out of her man.

Swimming across the bay,
The night is gray, so calm today.
She doesn't want to wait.
We've got to make the love complete tonight

In the mist of the morning he can't fight anymore
Thousands moon or more, he's been howling
Knock on the door, and scream that is soon ending
Mess on the floor again

We should not lock the open door
Full moon is on the sky and he's not man anymore
We see the change in him but can't
See what became out of her darling man

See what became out of that man",Full Moon
Santana,"From nowhere 
Through a caravan 
Around the campfire light 
A lovely woman in motion 
With hair as dark as night 
Her eyes were like that
Of a cat in the dark 
They hypnotize me with love

She was a gypsy woman 
She was a gypsy woman 

She danced around and round 
To a guitar melody 
From the fire her face 
Was all aglow 
How she enchanted me 
Oh how I'd like to hold her near 
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear 

I love you gypsy woman 

All through the caravan 
She was dancing with all the men

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea

On the beach where we used to run

Jamas volvio

For these thoughts here to leave me
There are no words to describe it
In french or english
Cause diamonds they fade
And flowers they bloom
And I'm telling you

That these feelings won't go away
They've been knockin me sideways
They've been knockin me out litely
Whenever you come around me
These feelings won't go away
They've been knockin me sideways
I keep thinking in a moment that
Time will take them away
But these feelings won't go away

Santana,"(Aceyalone):
Reflections
Think about the present and the past times
Reflect on your life and the bad times
Think about the crazy and the strange shit
Then dig within inside and try to change shit
Reflections
Reflect your mind
Reflect through time

(PSC):
My relation to these words spoken over beats leaps to and fro
All around, bound the energy in miles
Piles up towards the sky
High quantity of thoughts
Reflect the truth, sold another brother on the watch
On the clock of life, the mirror view
The clearest of reflection
Inspection of the lie that lies deep behind the stressin'
And it's pressing me like time
Rhymes is just illusions
A world in confusion
A dream of revolution
These reflections like mine in the puddle of life
Skip rocks, waves making ripple effects
Situations etched, lessons in stone tablets
For the reference to the habit
Forming addictions to the memories of past shit
I let go, it comes back
Boomerang behavior runs common in the obstacles
I want to shake my coat tails
They follow on the missions of my failure
Bring me down, crush me
Reflections can be beautiful, but most the time they rush me

(Aceyalone):
And in an instance you see the mirror image looking at you
Looks just like you, got you eyes, and you whole disguise
Reflections, he seen his image in the lake
Reflected on the grass roots which harbors all the snakes
Otherwise known as a snake pit
Remember the python on you ankle and all that fake shit?
Remember when the cake was lit, and the wind blew it out?
Before you could taste the cream, they sliced it up and threw it out
I recollect, I think back in retrospect
I reflect and connect my memories
Remember these good times and these hard times
But it's like that, and that's the way it is
And that's the way it was, but that ain't how it gotta be
Reflect your mind, it works every time
'cause if I knew then what I knew now, I'd be doin' fine
Reflect your mind, it works every time
'cause if you knew then what you know now, you'd be doin' fine

(BFAP):
Reflect though time....
I peep when I meet people, evil or positive
We live in the middle, lost within the riddle
On God's reflection I stand, within an intersection of life lost
Double crossed by man, we stand ignorant
False prophet, gothic, prehistoric logic mixed our minds
Reflectin' signs of anger, reflection banger, reflection slanger
Reflection bombing hangars of 747's
Strangers want to blow this shit to heaven
Reflection war, reflectin' poor, reflectin' Cold War
Reflectin' old multiple metal jacket tactics
You might see Murs reflectin' curse
Reflectin' hurts, you's a bitch in a male skirt
If you don't work to change your world, reflectin' hurls
In life with wisdom, beyond ""blaow! blaow!""
Fake headwrapped female visions
We used to be in love with Duran Duran in '95
I got a condo in the white part of town
Change your name to Shanunu Brown, used to be Mary Tibbles
Reflect your mind before you get lost in the riddle
Reflect though time, this is time, reflect though time

Her heart was cautious her mind was keen
She was always looking for the peccadillo
I hope she went to Mexico

Where's December's happy crew
With German bikes and sidecars too
They take the truck south to St. Louis, MO
Motorcycle all the way to Mexico
Where's my luck, where's my grace
Has it all been just a foolish chase
Every time I hear that rainy chill wind blow
I think it might be time to head to Mexico",They All Went to Mexico

Ya start run, you stumble, we catch one

Not accidental, intentional conscious decision
To Zion, we're marching through with African Mayans
Conquering Babylon with the heart of a lion
Behold to watch yesterday come back around
And the walls of Jericho come a-tumbling down

Tell me, how long has it been
Is everything, everything alright my friend
You see, time is passing, people asking how come none of this ain't lasting
Money will make people deal like they don't even have to feel
But no, it ain't real, it ain't real

Oh, do you like the way that it's going down
Do you like the way that it's going down

Pain never makes me cry but happiness does
It's so strange to watch your life walk by
Wishing it was, wishing it was more like a fantasy
Where every day surprises me, yeah
Wishing it was

(Oh-oh, oh-oh) wishing it was
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) wishing it was

Give this some thought, I'm sure you will know
This is the way it must be
Emotions will rise, emotions will flow
You bring out the tears in me

Pain never makes me cry but happiness does
It's so strange to watch your life walk by
Wishing it was, wishing it was more like a fantasy
Where every day surprises me, yeah
Wishing it was

(Oh-oh, oh-oh) wishing it was
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) wishing it was, oh, wishing it was
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) wishing it was, yes, I'm wishing it was
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) wishing it was, yes, I'm wishing it was
Yes, I'm wishing it was (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh, I'm wishing it was (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Ah, wishing it was (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh, I'm wishing it was, yes I'm wishing it was (oh-oh, oh-oh)

Santana,"Freedom, freedom 
Get up stand up, let's celebrate 
Freedom, talking about freedom 
This is the time for redemption 
Freedom, don't you want freedom for everybody 
This is the time for liberation

This is the day of celebration

Do You Like The Way 
Lauryn Hill 
Versions 

Watch the master plan, the pastures span 
Through the streets, move the sheep 
Flipped the beat, like the shepherd 
It's a new day, my crew stay forever striving 
Give thanks cause we alive, and been through the gutter 
Now we see the horizon 
It's clear to me now 

Used to be confused, took a lot of years to see how 
Now, we moving planets 
Take the average mind and expand it 
You take for granted like we're always gonna be disadvantaged 
But soon come, it soon come, ya soon done 
Ya start run, you stumble, we catch one 

In the rhythm, Santana lick the guits with precision 
Not accidental, intentional conscious decision 
To Zion, we're marching through with African Mayans 
Conquering Babylon with the heart of a lion 
And the walls of Jericho come a-tumbling down 
Tell me, how long has it been 
Is everything, everything alright my friend 

You see, time is passing, people asking how come none of this ain't lasting 
Money will make people deal like they don't even have to feel 
But no, it ain't real, it ain't real 
Oh, do you like the way that it's going down 
Do you like the way that it's going down 
Oh, do you like the way 
How long, how long will we wait, to sit down and communicate 
See, everything is relative, if you want to get then give 
Can't we all just build and live,can't we, can't we? 

Do you like the way that it's going down 
Do you like the way that it's going down 
Do you like the way that it's going down 
Do you like the way that it's going down",Day of Celebration [*]
Santana,"Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well, I hear you whispering in the words, to melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem, Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

[Chorus]
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real or else forget about it

But I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio
You hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world, so soft and slow
It's turning you round and round

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

[Chorus: x2]

Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Give me your heart, make it real

Santana,"You've got to change your evil ways, baby
Before I stop lovin' you
You've got to change, baby
And every word that I say is true
You got me runnin' and hidin' all over town
You got me sneakin' and a-peepin' and runnin' you down
This can't go on, Lord knows you got to change, baby

When I come home, baby
My house is dark and my pots are cold
You're hangin' round, baby
With Jean and Joan and-a who knows who
I'm gettin' tried of waitin' and foolin' around
I'll find somebody who won't make me feel like a clown
This can't go on, Lord knows you got to change, baby

When I come home, baby

Come dance to my rhythm
The rhythm of love
Come to my world
Where you can be real
And express how you feel

Something magic about tonight
Ooh you hide your emotions and wait till the moment is right
Cos once some music gets in your soul
Yeah it's just human nature, I know that you'll want to let go
If I could get through, it's the heart in you girl

Now there's an angel
Holding me
My way's easy
Even if you're fallen
Or you're struggling
There's still beauty
In what we do

So que sera
Let's go sailing on
There's a wise man
In every fool

I say come back
Come in from the cold
Into the warm
I feel like fire
Guiding you back home
As darkness falls

So everyone stands in line
Cos they wanna stay alive
To wait alone
No dog no bone
And then you find it's over
Still it tears your heart
To slip away
From the crowd

But if you have
What it takes
To return to where
All the world
Knows your name
Then que sera
Let's go sailing on
There's a wise man
In every fool

I say come back
Come in from the cold
Into the warm
I feel like fire
Guiding you back home
As darkness falls

I say come home
Leave it all behind
And settle down
I feel my love
Can give me what I want
For all time",Feels Like Fire

Santana,"Él se fue con el invierno
Él se ha ido a trabajar
No me ha escrito en mucho tiempo
Él dijo que volverá

Pero el tiempo pasó
No preguntes porque
Él ya no regresó a nuestro hogar
La frontera marcó
Su destino final
Y a mis brazos jamás volvió

Hoy es adiós
Mañana quizás
Sé que tu vas a volver
Hoy es adiós
Mañana quizás
No hay fronteras en nuestro querer

Ya ha pasado un nuevo invierno
Es de que te vi marchar
No hay un mundo mejor que el nuestro
Sé que un día volverás

Pero el tiempo pasó
No preguntes porque
Él ya no regresó a nuestro hogar

Santana,"I am a victim of my time
A produce of my age
There's no choosing my direction
I was a holy man but now
With all my trials behind me
I am weak in my conviction

And so I walk to try to get away
Knowing that someday 
I will finally have to face
The fear that will come from knowing that
The one thing I had left was you
And now you're gone

You were a victim of my crimes
A product of my rage
You were a beautiful distraction
I kept you locked away outside
Let misery provide
And now I am ashamed

And so I walk to try to find a space
Where I can be alone to live with my mistakes
And the fear that will come
From knowing that the one thing
I had left was you
And now you're gone",Nothing at All
