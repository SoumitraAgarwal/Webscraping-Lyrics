Where skies of blue are calling me
Where balmy air and golden moonlight
Caress the waving palms of Wai KiKi

Valleys with their rainbows
Your mountains green, and deep blue sea
Your fragrant flowers and dreamy music
Unite and sing a aloha-hi to me

The Alternate Routes,"So tell me what it's really like
When it's alright but it's just alright
I watch it get under your skin
And you can't even say what it is

But I know it's not like when you made your peace
With your former life or your dirty sheets
'Cause you're cleaner than you used to be
Everybody wants some company

Are you lonely, love?
Oh and you're the waiting around
For somebody to tell you that it's only love
And that it's better just to let it beat you

So tell me what it's all about
When you figure out that it's harder now
Out of touch now you're out of tune
It's not forever but I'm telling you

That I know love is a hate to bring home
Believe in yourself all alone
You had to slow down for a while
It's always been out of your style

Are you lonely, love?
Oh and you're the waiting around
For somebody to tell you that it's only love
And that it's better just to let it beat you

So tune it out like you always done
Tell me now would you tell the truth
Are you lonely?

Are you lonely, love?
Are you lonely, love?
Are you lonely, love?

",Are You Lonely
The Alternate Routes,"Roll your windows down
The summer's nearly gone
And only hours stand between you
And the cold that's coming on

And you count your questions
In the sky lit blue
And every color there is
Telling you

Time is a runaway
Coming for you
Time is a runaway
Coming for you

In my dreams I see in red
She cannot stay
And the summer leaves you
Like the girl who gets away

We sit here stranded
In a careless hue
And every color that is
Telling you

Time is a runaway
It's coming for you
Time is a runaway
Coming for you

Time is a runaway
It's coming for you
Time is a runaway
She's coming for you

In the morning when I rise
She's coming on to tell me

Time is a runaway
Coming for you
Time is a runaway
Coming for you

Time is a runaway
Coming for you
Time is a runaway
Coming for you

The Alternate Routes,"I wrote a song for you
when i heard about you leaving
i was riding in my car
staring out the window
and the sun set out
on the highway
half across the country
you were riding 
with the top down
just like i knew you would be


singing California,
Can you hear me now?
Sing me a song
that i can feel, somehow
cause i dont need
another reason,
to turn it up too loud
oh noooooo, can you hear me now?

and i wrote a song for you
on the blank side
of a coaster
with a pen i had to borrow
was crawlin off the way
so i bought another round
for some girl
from out of town
and i made her feel like staying
just the way you done for me
but did you leave the top down
in that desert in the dust cloud
cause i can hear you
burning out the stars


and you were singing 
California, can you hear me now?
Sing me a song
that i can feel, somehow
cause i dont need
another reason,
to turn it up too loud
oh noooooo, can you hear me now?

so why dont you call me
when you get there
on that warm day
in november
let the sun set on the ocean
and let yourself remember

::chorus::
California,
Can you hear me now?
Sing me a song
that i can feel, somehow
cause i dont need
another reason,

oh noooooo, can you hear me now?
oh noooooo, can you hear me now?

The Alternate Routes,"I need a new distraction
Passing all the days and I see that now I'm
Fading like the sun on a windowsill
Some things never change but I know I will

And I'm looking for a new direction
I blame it on a place where I keep my questions
Had enough so long and I ask you why
All I know is indecision

But in this life I find
That there is time enough to take it
But in this life I find
That there is time enough to waste it
On these endless conversations

And I just had to write it down and tell you
Send it in a letter; tell you know that I have
Raided every page in your history
And I thought about what life could be for me

And I'm looking for a new solution
There are some things that I do get used to

Wont you say it if you can if you care for me
Tell me how it is would you talk to me
In this life I find that there is time enough to take it
And in this life I find that there is time enough to waste it
On these endless conversations

Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no, hey
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no, hey

But in this life I find that there is time enough to take it
And in this life I find that there is time enough to waste it
On these endless conversations

The Amatucci Quintet,"Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

(Ooh) But he watch her so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day, that she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at he

The Amazing Rhythm Aces,"Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song
Lord where's my good girl gone?
She was all I ever wanted
She was an angel for sure
She stands even now in my memory
So sweet and pure
But all that made me happy
Was a bottle and a song
Used to stay out drinkin'
While she cried all night long
Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song
Lord where's my good girl gone?

She thought she could make me
Change in awhile so she learned
How to drink and she learned how to smile
I guess the pull of the bottle 
Was just a little bit to strong
Now she's left me and 
I don't know where she's gone
Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song
Lord where's my good girl gone?

And then one night she said ""I'm goin'""
But she didn't say where
It didn't seem to matter
And I didn't really care
But now that I'm sober
And I can see it all
I know I'm to blame for her part

The Amazing Rhythm Aces,"How do you deal with your broken heart?
It can't be mended.
When it's too late to make a new start, 
It's time to end it.
I can't restrain myself all of the time, 
Honey I just ain't like that.
I'm tired of explaining myself all of the time, 
Honey you know I don't like that, 
I just don't like that.

How do you deal with a jealous mind?
It becomes an obsession.
You think about the same things all the time, 
Love becomes possession.
I can't keep you with me all of the time, 
Honey you know it ain't like that.
I can only give you lovin' part of the time, 

Honey I know you don't like that, 
I know you don't like that.

And we become so sensitive, it hurts to touch.
Words can lose their meaning when you talk too much, 
Maybe everybody shouldn't talk too much.

How do you deal with a broken home?
The pieces are scattered.
Try to build a new life on your own, 
Pretend it doesn't matter.
I can't be watching you all of the time, 
Honey it just ain't like that.
I'm tired of feeling guilty all of the time, 
You know I don't like that, 
No, I don't like that.",Everybody's Talked Too Much
The Amazing Rhythm Aces,"I have heard the cannons thundering all night
And I cannot sleep for wondering why's a rebel's cause so right
And the morphine seems to do no good at all
And I would run away it I would not fall
I joined the southern cavalry for fun
And I had rode a thousand horses
Always had a way with a gun

Now I'm among the horseless riders lying still
Swallowed up by the cause on the widows hill
And I dreamed about a rose in a Spanish garden
And I kissed you and I placed it in your hair
And if I'm ever on my feet again I will
And I will run all the way just to meet you there

Through the day I watched those southern boys go down
And they lay like Georgia peaches bruised and broken on the ground
Through the night I wondered was it worth the pain
And I cried not revenge I called your name",Last Letter Home

Two hot blooded women one blonde one tan
Stood in the darkness and fought about a man

I can't live without him"" I heard Rita say
""And if I can't live with him I'll be damned if you will
Stay away from Rodrigo ot be killed.""

To get back down that there river
But once you get on board
You can wish it would last forever
Oh you just sit out on the deck
And fish off the side all day
Watch the sunny south land roll on by
And dream your blues away

A sailing on the northern sea

The Amazing Rhythm Aces,"Go away, go away, you cold north wind
Blowin' my muffler 'round and 'round
Your white powder blows coverin' up the icy ground
I'm a slippin' and a slidin' down this dead end stream
Like a sheep who is lost from the fold
I've been on the land and I've been on the sea
I ain't never seen a night so cold
Suddenly a face at the window
Looks like someone I might a seen before
Thought it musta been my imagination
When suddenly she opened up the door
""And I never expected to see you again
Must a been seven years ago
Now that you're here, why don't you come in
Don't stand outside in the snow""

She sat me down in that old rockin' chair
And she threw on another lump of coal
Said ""what's a southern boy like you, doin' here
Where the winter gets so long and cold""
""My history's a short one to tell
I've been travelin' all these seven years
I followed the music and the money around
And that's what I'm doin' up here""
She said ""I came up with my husband
He wanted to get away from Tennessee
He's up somewhere in the Rocky Mountains
But it just got to cold up there for me
And I never expected to see you again
Then again, you just never know
You better stay here until the weather clears
It's to cold to be out there in the snow""",Out of the Snow
The Amazing Rhythm Aces,"I rode in to Nashville
On the bus from Knoxville
I know I shouldn't
I just couldn't wait
I just had to see you
To get something straight
Livin' in a house 
No life, no place (?)
Sittin' in the bathtub
Hot water on my face
Not long here
A friend came down with me
I came to see about you
He came to see what he could see
And I hope I haven't come
All this way just to see
Waited all this time
Just to lose

Glad to see you
Glad you came
Voice sounds different
She still looks the same

Always looked good on you

It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.
I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.
To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.
What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;
So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine.
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
Darling, I love you!

For what else could the ingenue

A night in Shangril of ecstasy

Lanterns of blue
Twinkle in the shadows
While I dance with you
An echo in the wind

That lanterns lose their glow

Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our heavenly father
A blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The son of god by name

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not"", then said the angel
""Let nothing you affright
This day is born a Savior
Of virtue, power, and might
So frequently to vanquish all
The friends of Satan quite""

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm, and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightway
This blessed babe to find

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

But when to Bethlehem they came
Whereat this infant lay
They found him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His mother Mary kneeling
Unto the Lord did pray

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas
All others doth deface

Of paradise, where roses grew

Woah oh woah oh, the whole world is standing still
We're singing for the dead for the lost, and for the stolen
Our hearts beat double time, and oh they feel so broken, oh how they feel so broken

When I felt my feet drag heavy on the earth?
Is this really the answer I sought when I was searching for self worth?

Let the waves collapse above me, and wash away my fucking memory

Hello, are you there, with me?
I'm just trying to get in touch man.
I've been so fucking, so fucking down lately.
Like, I don't know what's happening, I'm just so tired all of time.

Can't speak 'cause everyone around me is passed out.

Call it quits, I'm sick of this.

It's all the same now, drink, drink, drink again.
I'm sorry man, I think it, you don't want to heat this.
I'm a mess, I'm sorry man, I just don't know who to turn to.

The last truce we ever came to in our adolescent war
And I start to feel the fever from the warm air through the screen
You come regular like seasons shadowing my dreams

And the Mississippi's mighty but it starts in Minnesota
At a place that you could walk across with five steps down
And I guess that's how you started like a pinprick to my heart
Now you rush right through me and I start to drown

And there's not enough room in this world for my pain
Signals cross and love gets lost and time passed makes it plain
Of all my demon spirits I need you the most
I'm in love with your ghost

Dark and dangerous like a secret that gets whispered in a hush
When I wake the things I dreamt about you last night makes me blush
And you kiss me like a lover then you sting me like a viper
I go follow to the river play your memory like a piper

And I feel it like a sickness how this love is killing me
I'd walk into the fingers of your fire willingly
And that's the edge of sanity, I've never been this close
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost

Unknowing captor, you never know how much you
Pierce my spirit but I can't touch you
Can you hear it, a cry to be free?
I'm forever under lock and key as you pass through me

Now I see your face before me, I would launch a thousand ships
To bring your heart back to my island as the sand beneath me slips
As I burn up in your presence and I know now how it feels
To be weakened like Achilles with you always at my heels

This bitter pill I swallow is the silence that I keep
It poisons me, I can't swim free, the river is too deep
Though I'm baptized by your touch, I am no worse than most

The Andrews Sisters,"There's a burlesque theatre where the gang loves to go
To see Queenie the cutie of the burlesque show
And the thrill of the evening is when out Queenie skips
And the band plays the polka while she strips

""Take it off,"" ""Take it off"" Cries a voice from the rear
""Take it off,"" Take it off"" Soon it's all you can hear
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops! And always just in time

She's as fresh and as wholesome as the flowers in May
And she hopes to retire to the farm someday
But you can't buy a farm until you're up in the chips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

""Take it off,"" ""Take it off"" all the customers shout,
""Down in front"" ""Down in front"" while the band beats it out
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops! And always just in time

Queenie, Queen of them all
Queenie, someday you'll fall
Someday church bells will chime
In strip polka time

Oh! She hates corny waltzes and she hates the gavotte
And there's one big advantage if the music's hot
It's a fast moving exit just in case something rips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

Drop around, take it in, it's the best in the west
""Take it off,"" ""Take it off"" you can yell like the rest
Take her out when it's over, she's a peach when she's dressed
But she stops! And always just in time

Queenie, Queen of them all
Queenie, someday you'll fall
Someday church bells will chime

It's tico time for all the lovers on the block.

I've got a heavy date,
A tete a tete at eight,
So speak, oh, tico, tell me if it's getting late?
If I'm on time, cuckoo,
But, if I'm late, woo-woo!

For just a birdie, and a birdie who goes nowhere,
He knows of every lover's lane and how to go there;
For in affairs of the heart

The Frenchman he would never see
It's only for Americans
The prices in the smart cafe
The Frenchman he would never pay
The price that's more is only for
Americans from the U.S.A.

And slyly winks her eye
That's only for the Yankee

Only for Americans
The Frenchmen on the boulevards
Don't buy those dirty postal cards
They're only for Americans
The little holes for peeping through

The French would bore, they're only for
Americans from the U.S.A.

Only for Americans

Antiques as old as seven weeks
They're only for Americans

Those fancy sauces with ptomaine

With little ulcers on their tails
And all that cheese was made to please
Americans from the U.S.A.

While the American carouses
Where crimson shadows creep
The French avoid those houses
They go to bed to sleep

Only for Americans
A Frenchman wouldn't be impressed
To see a show with girls undressed
That's only for Americans
The French don't go to naked shows
They've seen what's underneath the clothes
And each encore is only for
Americans from the U.S.A.

Only for Americans
The Frenchmen don't keep company
With south of France society
That's only for Americans
The Frenchman hasn't large amounts
To pay for Barons, Dukes and Counts
That you adore, they're only for
Americans from the U.S.A.

We like to keep the good relations
That nothing must upset
We give you decorations
That Frenchmen seldom get

Only for Americans

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more
Darling, I love you

The Andrews Sisters,"Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore dimly seen thro' the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner: O, long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash'd out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

O, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand,
Between their lov'd homes and the war's desolation;
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land
Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserv'd us as a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause is just,
And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust""

Near the hills where the daffodils grow

it?
Yes, Ches. We used to sit on a seat with the Thames 
Embankment behind us. You had a newspaper and read the headlines.
That's quite right, Bud. I've still got that paper. D'you 
remember the date? Nineteen hundred and twenty-six.
Ches, read those headlines again.
Ah, here's one. Gertrude Edderley, eighteen-year-old American. 
First woman to swim The Channel.
Listen to this. Cricket. Ashes for England after fourteen years.
Irish woman, Violet Gibson, shoots Mussolini in the nose.
Oh! listen. Churchill's unpopular budget. Five per-cent tax on 
all legal bets.
Charlie Chaplin not to retire.
Second time in history, Atlantic flown by three Spaniards.
Here's one. Death of Barbara La Marr, film actress with five 
husbands.
BBC asks for nine shillings instead of seven-and-six for wireless 
licence.
Hopes of return to penny post.
Listen to this, Ches. Bookmakers in a bad way.

The Andrews Sisters,"Whadda they do on a rainy night in Rio?
Whadda they do when there is no starry sky?
Where do they go when they can't go for a walk?
Do they sit at home and talk,
Or do they sit and sigh, ""Aye Aye!""?

Where do they woo on a rainy night in Rio?
How can a guy meet a sweetheart by the sea?
Maybe the girl wants a tender kiss, and yet,
How tender can you get
When you're beneath a wet palm tree?

Whadda they do in Mississippi
When skies are drippy?
And whadda they do when it's murky
In Alberquerque?
And whadda they do in Old Arkoona
When the moon above ain't bright?
Well, that's what they do in Rio
On a rainy night!

But whadda they do when skies are dreary
Along Lake erie?
And whadda they do in St Louis
When nights are dewy?
And whadda they do in Colorado

I don't wanna face the day, the day, today
Long night leaves me stranded
Black visions, danger signs
No love, need protection
Feels like I'm on production line
Daggers of dawn, cold hearted-day
Why does it have to be morning?
Cover my head, stayin' in bed
Too late, the luckless warning
I don't wanna face the day, the day, today
I don't wanna face the day, the day, today
Outside, screaming city
Red lights and hungry eyes
Sucks like a space invader
The vacuum of its lies
Stealing my strength, stealing my time
It's raining in a world of traders
I don't wanna face the day
I don't wanna face the day
Let me keep on sleeping
Forget that I'm alone
One day of faceless living
Is 24 hours too long!
I don't wanna face the day
I don't wanna face the day
I don't wanna face the day, the day, today
I don't wanna face the day, the day, today
Give the night, it's more forgiving
Hold back the light from my eyes
Please stay invisible darkness
Can't see the tears I cry
I know it's coming loaded with nothing
Trapped in a tunnel of time
I don't wanna face the day

You got everything that you want
Cats are runnin' to your candy coloured Chevrolet
Comsume and comsume and the loser has to pay
The higher you climb, th deeper you go
Talk about a change, nothing change so slow
Climbing up te ivory stairs, never gonna get anywhere
Slipping on the first step, can't get a good grip

To take a chance on a loaded dice
And if you they will remember you cause
They know once is nothing when you need it twice
Take care of desire, beware of the bad nights
Make sure that you feel alright because
Night comes early when you're lonely
When you said you wanted aces and eights
You added fire to the joker's curse
You volunteered to return for more
Well he's got you now for better of for worse
Doing time on your own, can't see where you're goin'
Your precious fantasy still leves you lonely
In the night, do you wait for the time to pass?
In the night, do you make love to your looking glass?

I'm a hummin' and a strummin' all over God's world
You can't remember when you had your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels

You didn't know what rock and roll was
Until you met my drummer on the Grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line, yeah

Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
The heater don't work and it's oh so cold
You're lookin' tired, you're lookin' kinda  beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet

You didn't know how rock and roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
Halfway home in the parking lot
By the look in her eye she was givin' what she got

So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned

The Animals,"Now listen here to the story of Bo Diddley
The rock 'n roll scene in general
Bo Diddley was born Ellis McDaniels
In a place called McCoom

In Mississippi about nineteen-twenty-sex
He moved to Chicago about ninetten-thirty-eight
Where his name was eventually changed to Bo Diddley
He practised the guitar every day and sometimes into the night

'Til his papa's hair began to turn white
His pa said ""Son, listen here, I know""
""You can stay but, uh, that guitar's just got to go""
So he pulled his hat down over his eyes

And headed on out for them western skies
I think Bob Dylan said that
He hit New York City
He began to play the Apollo in Harlem

Good scene there
Everybody raved
One day, one night
Came a Cadillac, four headlights

Came a man with a big long fat cigar
He said come here son, I'm going to make you a star
Bo Diddley said uh, what's in it for me?
The man said uh, shut your mouth son and play the guitar

And you just wait and see
Well, Bo made it, he made it real big
And so did the rest of the Rock 'n Roll scene along with him
And a white guy called Johnny Otis took Bo Diddley's rhythm

And changed into hand jive
And it went like this

In a little old country town one day
A little old country man begin to play
Had two guitars and a beat-up saxophone
When the drummer said those cats begin to

Oh baby, ooh we oh oh
Ooh la la that rock 'n roll
You hear me, ooh we oh oh
Ooh la la that rock 'n roll

Then the U.S. music scene, there was big changes made
Due to circumstances beyond our control
Such as payola
The rock 'n roll scene died after two years of solid rock

You got discs like, uh
Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
And so forth

About, uh, one year later
In a place called Liverpool in England
Uh, four young guys with mop haircuts
Begin to sing stuff like, uh

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been workin' like a dog
And so on

A place called Richmond in Surrey
Way down in the deep south
Where the guys had long hair down their backs sang
I want to be your lover baby
I want to be your man, yeah
And all that jazz

Well we been doin' this number Bo Diddley
For quite some time now
Bo Diddley visited this country last year
And we were playin' the Club A-Go-Go in Newcastle, our home town

And the doors opened one night
And to our surprise in walked the man himself, Bo Diddley
Along with him was, uh, Jerome Green, his maraca man
And the Dutchess, his gorgeous sister

Now we're doin', uh, we're doin' this number
Along with them came Rolling Stones and The Mersey Beats
They're all standin' around diggin' it
And I overheard Bo Diddley talkin'

He turned around to Jerome Green, he said
Hey Jerome, what do you think of these guys doin' our, our material?
Jerome said uh, where's the bar, man
Please show me to the bar
He turned around to the Dutchess and he said

Hey Dutch, what do you think of these young guys doin' our material?
She said ah, I don't know, I only came across here to see the
Changin' of the guards and all that jazz
But Bo Diddley looked up at me and he said, uh

With half-closed eyes and a smile
He said man"", took off his glasses
He said man
That sure is the biggest load of rubbish ever heard in my life

When I was trying to get to you, oh baby

On a lonely dessert highway
And at 25 cents to get to you

The Animals,"I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I laid there in the sun and felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
The fact that me an overfed long haired leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie, hmmm
But there I was
Hmm, I was taken to a place
The hall of the mountain kings
I stood high by the mountain tops
Naked to the world
In front of
Every kind of girl
There was long one's, tall ones, short ones, brown ones
Black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones
Out of the middle, came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy
She said,

Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl

I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
In the other a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said

Take the wine dig that girl
Spill the wine, dig that girl
Spill the wine, dig that girl, come on, come on
Spill the wine, dig that girl
Take that girl, yeah
It's on girl, all you gotta do is spill that wine
Spill that wine, let me feel, let me feel hot, yeah, yeah, ooh

The Animals,"I went down to Old Joe's Bar
On the corner by the square
All the men were having drinks, same as usual
And the same old crowd was there
Oh, no...

On my left stood my good friend, Joseph McGinley
Oh his eyes were blood-shot and red
And he turned to the people standing by him 
And these are the words he said...

I went down to that St James Infirmary
They had my baby there
She was lying on a long, long white table, yeah
So cold, so still... She was dead
Oh no...

The Animals,"My leader told me to jump in the river
The river was deep and the weather was winter
After a sailer very kindly saved me
My leader told me, you'd better take it easy
I took it so easy my leader called me lazy

Through the lack of red meat
Everything was getting hazy
Friends looked at me and said,
Man, you gotta be crazy

Oh, oh leader

My leader said son you'd better get yourself together
Never mind the fools who know what we're getting into
But a forty mile walk would do us both a world of good
And he sat down and watched me take off down the road

Well, I walked so far my feet began to bleed
If this was good for me I just couldn't see it
A motorist picked me up and said
Look man, you must be crazy

Oh, oh leader
Oh, oh leader

My leader came to see me in a hospital bed
Well at least I really knew that my leader really cared
After giving me a second-hand roach
He said where's your donation man,
It's all for a good cause.

He left me all alone to work the riddle out
But I just couldn't make it so I began to shout
They stuck a hypodermic deep down into me
Said, look out nurse I think we got a loony

Oh, oh leader
Okay baby follow me now
Follow your leader
All right

Now here I sit in a state-run asylum
Limitless, friendless but much more together
I decided to do some good book readin'
About the art of people leadin'

Now I'm the leader and they're being led
What's the matter if they're crazy till you hear what I've said
Being the leader is really where its at
But just how long can a good thing last

Oh, oh leader

The Anniversary,"The muscle and bone - they encase my heart but never touch my soul.
I'll save that for the water and its shore, fear makes friends with joy.

And I'll march slowly and I'll never forget
How the music stopped or the feel of your breath. (four times)

The flesh and the blood - they keep my body warm but still my mind is cold.
To know what's fair is not always fair, but what proves real will never flee.

And I'll march slowly and I'll never forget
How that black dress fell upon your white neck.
Grand Isle rests quiet this time of year
And I know you will be leaving soon my dear

You've been writing me rules, shrinking maps and redrawing borders

I've been living in bed because now you tell me to sleep
I've been hiding my voice and my face and you decide when I eat

In your dreams I'm a criminal, horrible, sleeping around
While you're awake I'm impossible, constantly letting you down

Little porcelain figurines, glass bullets you shoot at the wall
Threats of castration for crimes you imagine when I miss your call
With the bite of the teeth of that ring on my finger, I'm bound to your bedside, your eulogy singer

The Antlers,"There's a bear inside your stomach
The cub's been kicking from within
He's loud, though without vocal chords
We'll put an end to him
We'll make all the right appointments
No one ever has to know
And then tomorrow I'll turn 21
We'll script another show
We'll play charades up in the Chelsea
Drink champagne although you shouldn't be
We'll be blind and dumb until we fall asleep
None of our friends will come
They dodge our calls
And they have for quite a while now
It's not a shock
You don't seem to mind and I just can't see how

We're too old
We're not old, old at all
Just too old
We're not old, old at all

There's a bear inside your stomach
The cub's been kicking you for weeks
And if this isn't all a dream
Well then we'll cut him from beneath
Well we're not scared of making caves
Or finding food for him to eat
We're terrified of one another
And terrified of what that means
But we'll make only quick decisions
And you'll just keep my in the waiting room
And all the while I'll know we're fucked
And not getting unfucked soon
When we get home we're bigger strangers than we've ever been before
You sit in front of snowy television, suitcase on the floor

The Antlers,"In a nightmare, I am falling from the ceiling into bed beside you
You're asleep, I'm screaming, shoving you to try to wake you up
And like before, you've got no interest in the life you live when you're awake
Your dreams still follow storylines, like fictions you would make

So I lie down against your back, until we're both back in the hospital
But now it's not a cancer ward, we're sleeping in the morgue
Men and women in blue and white, they are singing all around you
With heavy shovels holding earth, you're being buried to you neck
In that hospital bed, being buried quite alive now
I'm trying to dig you out but all you want is to be buried there together

You're screaming
And cursing
And angry
And hurting me
And then smiling
And crying
Apologizing

I've woken up, I'm in our bed, but there's no breathing body there beside me
Someone must have taken you while I was stuck asleep
But I know better as my eyes adjust
You've been gone for quite a while now, and I don't work there in the hospital
(They had to let me go)

When I try to move my arms sometimes, they weigh too much to lift
I think you buried me awake (my one and only parting gift)
But you return to me at night just when I think I may have fallen asleep
Your face is up against mine, and I'm too terrified to speak

You're screaming
And cursing
And angry
And hurting me
And then smiling
And crying
Apologizing",Epilogue
The Antlers,"I wish that I had known in
That first minute we met
The unpayable debt
That I owed you

Because you'd been abused
By the bone that refused you
And you hired me
To make up for that

Walking in that room
when you had tubes in your arms,
those singing morphine alarms
out of tune

They had you sleeping and eating
And I didn't believe them
When they called you
A hurricane thundercloud

When I was checking vitals
I suggested a smile
You didn't talk for a while
You were freezing

You said you hated my tone
It made you feel so alone
So you told me
I had to be leaving

But something kept me standing
By that hospital bed
I should have quit but instead
I took care of you

You made me sleep all uneven
And I didn't believe them
When they told me that there
Was no saving you",Kettering
The Antlers,"Suddenly every machine stopped at once
And the monitors beeped the last time
Hundreds of thousands of hospital beds
And all of them empty but mine

Well, I was lying down with my feet in the air
Completely unable to move
The bed was misshaped, and awkward and tall
And clearly intended for you

You checked yourself out when you put me to bed
And tore that old band off your wrist
But you came back to see me for a minute or less
And left me your ring in my fist
My hair started growing, my face became yours
My femur was breaking in half
The sensation was scissors and too much to scream
So instead, I just started to laugh

The Antlers,"In the middle of the night I was sleeping sitting up
When a doctor came to tell me, ""Enough is enough""

He brought me out into the hall (I could have sworn it was haunted)
And told me something that I didn't know that I wanted to hear:
That there was nothing that I could do to save you
The choir's going to sing, and this thing is going to kill you
Something in my throat made my next words shake
And something in the wires made the lightbulbs break
There was glass inside my feet and raining down from the ceiling
It opened up the scars that had just finished healing
It tore apart the canyon running down your femur
(I thought that it was beautiful, it made me a believer)
And as it opened I could hear you howling from your room
But I hid out in the hall until the hurricane blew
When I reappeared and tried to give you something for the pain
You came to hating me again and just sang your refrain

You had a new dream, it was more like a nightmare
You were just a little kid, and they cut your hair
Then they stuck you in machines, you came so close to dying
They should have listened, they thought that you were lying
Daddy was an asshole, he fucked you up
Built the gears in your head, now he greases them up
And no one paid attention when you just stopped eating
""Eighty-seven pounds!"" and this all bears repeating

Tell me when you think that we became so unhappy
Wearing silver rings with nobody clapping
When we moved here together we were so disappointed
Sleeping out of tune with our dreams disjointed
It killed me to see you getting always rejected
But I didn't mind the things you threw, the phones I deflected
I didn't mind you blaming me for your mistakes
I just held you in the door-frame through all of the earthquakes
But you packed up your clothes in that bag every night
And I would try to grab your ankles (what a pitiful sight)
But after over a year, I stopped trying to stop you
From stomping out that door
Coming back like you always do
Well no one's going to fix it for us, no one can
You say that, ""No one's going to listen, and no one understands""

So there's no open doors and there's no way to get through
There's no other witnesses, just us two

There's two people living in one small room
From your two half-families tearing at you
Two ways to tell the story (no one worries)
Two silver rings on our fingers in a hurry
Two people talking inside your brain
Two people believing that I'm the one to blame
Two different voices coming out of your mouth
While I'm too cold to care and too sick to shout

You had a new dream, it was more like a nightmare
You were just a little kid, and they cut your hair
Then they stuck you in machines, you came so close to dying
They should have listened, they thought that you were lying

The Antlers,"With the door closed, shades drawn, the world shrinks
Let's open up those blinds
But someone has to sweep the floor
Pick up her dirty clothes
That job's not mine
Now that everyone's an enemy, my heart sinks
Let's put away those claws
I don't blame them for their curtains-calls
Because I pulled the rope
I want to call them back out for applause

Spring and Thompson on the first of May is horrible
We hid in catacombs
So now I'm sleeping next to mousetraps
In a bed of all our clothes

It was easier to lock the doors and kill the phones
Than to show my skin
Because the hardest thing
Is never to repent for someone else
It's letting people in

Well you can come inside
Unlock the door, take off your shoes
But this might take all night
To explain to you I would have walked out those sliding doors

You knew just what to expect

I want to bust down the door
If you're willing to forgive
I've go the keys, I'm letting people in

Don't be scared to speak
Don't speak with someone's tooth
Don't bargain when you're weak
Don't take that sharp abuse
Some patients can't be saved
But that burden's not on you

And how she took me by surprise
When the wax it melted from her wings

When I come home
Will I find you alone?
'Cause you're moving on so fast
And I thought you'd take it slow

As I look from my eyes
I can't see my hands in front of me
As I weave my way through land mines
I've learned to have some peace

When I come home
Will I find you alone?
'Cause you're moving on so fast
And I thought you'd take it slow
I thought you'd take it slow

She made me wings and I'll follow
Higher, and higher I rose
And how I came so close
But gravity it has a way of taking control

Will I find you alone?

The same emotions that brought us together aren't there

Should we go our separate ways or stay together
Believe me when I say

I'm not gonna change
I'm not gonna change now
If you walk away
There's no turning back now

And see a reflection that isn't me

I can't stop grinnin'
I had to much Tequila last night

Jose Cuervo you are a friend of mine
I like to drink you with a little salt and lime
Did I kiss all the cowboys?
Did I shoot out the lights?
Did I dance on the bar?
Did I start a fight?

Now wait a minute
Things don't look to familiar
Who is this cowboy
Who's sleepin' beside me?
He's awful cute, but how'd I
Get his shirt on?

The Arabian Prince,"Rollin, everybody dance with the soul and
I'm the man with the mic and I'm controlin the floor
Givin you more and there's more in store 
As I take this party to the encore
Higher, hot like fire
Everybody wet with the sweat cause it makes you perspire
Drippin, but nobody's slippin
The beat is hittin and yo...I ain't trippin
I know how to make you flow from the intro
With the wave of your hand and then say ""ho""
Everybody off the wall
Get invloved...
Your problem's solved
I'm here to make you quit it if you ain't here to dance
Then take this chance and get out of here
This is for the real party people so you know what's up
It's time to dance so get on up

[Chorus:] Get-get-get-get on up...get get on up (x4)
Movin, gettin with the groovin
Everybody dance cause the song's improvin
If you can't dance rock your head to the beat
Throw your hands in the air... 'til you feel weak
Yeah then you shake it, 'til you can't take it
If you get tired move around and fake it
And stop....and do a dance or two
So everybody in the place can get wild
With to the program, this is a show-jam
Ask me to stop, and I'll say ""no ma'am""
Tell the DJ to turn it up a little louder
Make the crowd and party people take a shower
And the music, I can use it
Make you want to go and jump through this
And get busy...cause I know what's up
Everybody in the place you gotta get on up

[Chorus]
Yo, maxin, nah no time for relaxin
Just get into the floor instead of waxin, the sound
No time to sit down...
You have to get up so you can get down
Let yourself go, get into the flow
As Arab makes this a hype show
From intro to intro you know
That the size of the crowd will grow, large
That's the kinda life I'm livin
That's why I try to keep givin
Something new for you to try to dance to
Work your body 'til the song is through
Just flex it all the way up to the exit
But don't stop there cause next is the chorus
Yeah there's more of this, so you know what's up
You gotta get on up

The Ark,"Whatever happened to the funky race?
A generation lost in pace
Wasn't life supposed to be more than this?
In this kiss I'll change your bore for my bliss

But let go of my hand and it will slip on the sand
If you don't give me the chance
To break down the walls of attitude
I ask nothing of you
Not even your gratitude

And if you think I'm corny
Then it will not make me sorry
It's your right to laugh at me
And in turn that's my opportunity
To feel brave

Because ridicule is no shame
Oh, it's just a way to eclipse hate
It's just a way to put my back straight
Oh, it's just a way to remain sane

Every morning I would see her getting off the bus
The picture never drops, it's like a multicoloured snapshot
Stuck in my brain
It kept me sane for a couple of years
As it drenched my fears
Of becoming like the others
Who become unhappy mothers
And fathers of unhappy kids
And why is that?

'Cos they've forgotten how to play
Oh, maybe they're afraid to feel ashamed
To seem strange, to seem insane
To gain weight, to seem gay

Take it jackpot, crackpot, strutting like a peacock

Crackpot, haircut, dye your hair in glowing red and blue

Do, do, do what you wanna do
Don't think twice, do what you have to do
Do, do, do, do, let your heart decide
What you have to do
That's all there is to find

Why should it be so bad to be bad,
When it´s so hard to be anything at all?
And why does everyone seem to forget
What it´s like to be all alone
As soon as they
Have got someone, oh it´s no fun

And tell me this night is over

Just want to be the one
Who makes you smile

To keep you safe and sound
I would climb the highest mountain
I would swim the widest sea
I would wrestle a gorilla to the ground
I would fend off a dozen charging rhinos
I would catch a storm of killer bees
I would fight a firey dragon with a wooden sword
If I didn't know what this could do to me

'Cause it's too dangerous (too dangerous)
I'd really like to do it
But I might get hurt
It's dangerous (too dangerous)
I don't feel like bleeding
On my brand new shirt
You might say I'm cowardly
Or say I'll full of fright
You might call me yellow
And baby you'd be right!

So I'd skip across volcanoes full of lava
I'd even grab a tiger by the tail
I would make fun of
A boxing champion's mother
But my courage and my bowels both would fail
I would fight off a bunch
Of angry Kosacks
I would stop a thousand
Bullets with my hand
I would laugh
As my leg was amputated..
But baby, I'm not that kind of man!

'Cause it's too dangerous (too dangerous)
I use big words
But I never do the deed
It's dangerous (too dangerous)
I faint like a baby
If I see somebody bleed
I haven't got a backbone
I'm as timid as a mouse
I would find a cure for this
But I can't leave the house!

Said you were a friend of mine
She could trust me out of sight

And she's waiting for me somewhere out there, yeah

Don't say my love is too familiar
'Cause she's everything to me
Don't say what she don't know won't kill her (ooh)
I'm playing away
Put your hands where I can see
Baby, you know what I mean
'Cause you're looking good to me
And you know I feel the heat
As you button up your dress
And I wake up in your bed
With a head full of regrets
Saying please don't turn me on

It's getting late I know I should be gone?
Don't want to lose the love I have

Around the Earth
We're waiting for the sun to rise
A power through this cloud of mine

Free will for the dead and old
I dream of you in my skin
With you I want to waste some time
Think twice
Tonight we'll realise

Think I need somebody
A real somebody now
Gonna need somebody

The Asteroids Galaxy Tour,"Well, I got my mind out of sight
Lost the common sense,
Got a rave in my brain
Like I'm without defense.

Till I catch my eyes right in front of me,
It's a bloke of a man finally taking me.
Hey cute from the left, oh yeah
Why'd his move he had me shake out a lie
He really had it going

The crowd's getting thinner
We are getting closer,
With a hole in my head
He took me to his sofa

Well now the sun ain't shining no more,
I don't know why but I've seen it before.
Ain't got no joy no man to lean on,
He leaves my soul on the floor like a doll.

He was young, he was hot,
He made me feel alive.
So in love I was falling,
Ooh, it's early morning.

He took me in his hands
And squeezed me real tight.
I was humbled (???)
But depending on this guy
He didn't last very long,
A week or maybe two.
When he called me on the phone
Saying baby I don't love you.

Just another lonely love
Always giving never get.
And now I feel so stupid
It's like a deja vu ooooooo

Because the sun ain't shining no more,
I don't know why but I've seen it before.
Ain't got no joy no man to lean on,
He leaves my soul on the floor like a doll.

Oh no the sun ain't shining no more,
I don't know why but I've seen it before.
Ain't got no joy no man to lean on,
He leaves my soul on the floor like a doll.

Yeah, yeaaahhhh

For a while I'm shining
But later I'm crying.
I'm sick and stronger,
I'm always getting weaker.

The Asteroids Galaxy Tour,"The sky is blue the end is near
A wave of heat is running clear
Walk this way come on inside
Houses chill stay a while

Your my one who make me laugh
Making out in the aftermath
Coolin' down the sun for me
Coolin' down to set me free

Oh

Good times roll we're here to stay
We hide away on a sunny day
Bad times come but we're not there
We're in the shade sayin' we don't care

Boy it's good we end it here
No more sweat there's no more fear

Escape the heat, escape the meat
