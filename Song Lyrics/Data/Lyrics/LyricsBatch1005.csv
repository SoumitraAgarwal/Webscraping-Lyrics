Marillion,"The rock-star trip. Some serious ship
White-knuckle journey blackened my
Eye & cut my lip
Better to be a doctor or a man who
Walks the earth
Hedonistic laughing boys
What's any of it worth?

Look at myself
Look at myself

Escaped to this car
Drove to a bar somewhere
The beautiful game
Such a thin line between love & hate

Look at myself
Look at myself

Mr Taurus ate a thesaurus
Made the girls cry & skipped straight
To the chorus
Mr Taurus had a great fall
All the King's horses were no good
At all
No good at all

Here's one I broke earlier
I broke earlier

Woke up in a spaceship of shimmer
Ing gold
Tutenkhamen sleeping
Should'a left him alone
Floating round in Orion
Arrow pointing to heaven
Between all the planets
Out in the cold

Everyone I love
Everyone I love
Everyone I love lives somewhere else
And I have time to look at myself
Look at myself
Look at myself

And I've seen enough
I've seen enough
Everyone I love lives somewhere else
Everyone I love lives somewhere else

Somewhere Else
Somewhere Else

Marillion,"A voice from the past
Entered my head today
Fresh & alive. Full of life, passion
And pain.
A voice now past.
A beautiful soul. Gone, gone, gone.

Speaking clearly - clearer than
The living
Talking perfect sense
Used to not being understood
While talking perfect sense to the
Next generation

Have we caught up yet?
Is it time?
I think it is.
Enough is enough
Enough is enough

A voice from the past
Entered my head today
Tiny child sighed in my ear.
Giving up breathing in
Over & out
Over & out
Taken by bad luck & the ill fortune
Of geography.

Common cold. Dirty water. HIV.
Common apathy. Common crime.
Perfect nonsense to the next
Generation

Dead yet alive
Dead yet alive
Gone but shouting anger
Gone but talking perfect sense

Have we caught up yet?
Is it time? Well I say it is. I say it is.
Deaf & dumbed-down
Enough is enough

Give me a smile. Hold out your hand.
I don't want your money
I don't want your land
Gimme a smile. Hold out your hand.
I don't want your money
I don't want your land
I want you to wake up & do
Something strange
I want you to listen
I want you to feel someone else's pain
Someone else's pain
Someone else's pain
Someone else's pain.

Marillion,"I've done everything that can be done to heal this wound
Left it on it's own for years

I've done everything that can be done to heal this wound
Left it on it's own for years
Couldn't touch it, didn't pick it, didn't get it wet
It didn't stop the bleeding

I bandaged it, I wrapped it, stitched it, tourniqueted it
I held it stiff & aching in the air
Held it there til I went beserk
Didn't sleep
It didn't work
Didn't stop it weeping

And the wound is your life
And your life took on a life of it's own
(Or so you foolishly thought)
And your life rolled on over me Bang-Bang like 56 train wheels
Every time I heard news of you

And the wound was in every lousy song on the radio

And the pain was like a tree-fern in the dark, damp, forgotten places
Darkness didn't stop her growing
New-born baby cells dividing..
Curled up tight unrolling day by day
Stretching up, stretching out
Forming the same identical shape
Clones. There ain't too much sadder than
Clones - relentlessly emerging from the hairy heart of the wound

And the fern is beautiful in it's own way
Uncurling in the dark
Beautiful with no one there to see it
As the would weeps & aches

(Now there's some sad things known to the man from the planet Marzipan)",The Wound
Marillion,"I gazed upon you from the bleachers
A creature so foreign to me
With the stars and the stripes wrapped around you
Well how could I know there was England below?
I gazed upon you and I wondered
Cheerleader with hair of red flame
But that was first glance, I saw only the dance
And the distance from New York to Yorkshire

Truth's always stranger than fiction
And here it's especially true
Here in the home of Miss USA
What's a wide-eyed English boy going to do?

I never knew much about baseball
But I was quick with the US clich√©
The crowd gave a roar and I don't know what for
The Major League rules get me so confused

Truth's always stranger than fiction
The cheerleader showed me around
You with the heart of the USA
And me with the spite of a small English town

Central Park after dark, is safe these days
Depending on the game you play.

America, house of Blues
What do you know?
Gimme the news.

America, shock and awe.
Not any more.

Tell me what to do
Tell me what to do
Tell me what to do.",Especially True
Marillion,"I am the man from the planet Marzipan
Good to see you
My eyes are screwed up tight, unaccustomed to the light
And all my arms and all my legs are much too long
Much too long

My head is in a state, unaccustomed to the weight
I wear this mild expression, I'm an alien to aggression
Music only does me in my skins so thin

There's so much that I can't take in
There's so much that I can't take in
There's so much that I daren't take in

Can you feel through my skin to me?
Can you feel through my skin to me?

Throw a tarpaulin over me
I look like a rotary washing line
I am the face of 2069
I have trouble with my breathing
My net-curtain lungs
And the thoughtlessness of other people's careless tongues

The air's so thin
Oh my skin
The air's so thin
Oh my skin

I am the man from the planet Marzipan
My eyes are screwed up tight, unaccustomed to the light
I wear this mild expression, I'm an alien to aggression

The air's so thin
Oh my skin
Oh my skin..

I'm so close..
I'm so close to a breakdown
A constant crisis in the heart

What the hell is going on here?
Earth creatures. Amazing, beautiful and mad.
Monkeys trying to be stars
Monkeys carrying their Gods around
Lies and murder in the name of heaven
Seen it all before in the kindergartens of the Universe
It would be quaint if it wasn't so damned scary

I can't listen and I can't watch
I can see inside the machine
I can see the join! I can see the join.

Can you feel through my skin to me?
Can you see through my skin?
It's all here in my skin, you see
It's all here in my skin,
Here in my skin!

Time comes around, out of my hands
Small boats on the beach at the dead of night
Come and go before first light, first light

Leave me running in the wheel

What is there to feel

And how do we now come to be
Afraid of sunlight
Tell me girl, why you and me
Were scared of sunlight

How do we now come to be
Afraid of sunlight
Tell me girl, why you and me
Were scared of sunlight

Been in pain for so long
I can't even say what hurts anymore
I will leave you alone, I will deny
I will leave you to bleed, I will leave you with your life

So how do we now come to be
Afraid of sunlight
Tell me girl, why you and me
Were scared of sunlight

All your spirit rack abuses
Come to haunt you back by day
All your byzantine excuses
Given time, give you away

So don't be surprised when daylight comes
To find that memory prick your thumbs
You'll tell them where to run to hide
I'm already dead, it's a matter of time
It's a matter of time

So how do we now come to be
Afraid of sunlight
Tell me if you're aware you an' me

Marillion,"How long can you stand
Tightening up
Avoiding the fight
Avoiding the truth
Tighten the smile
Tighten the lie
Will you get what you want
To be cursed with your dreams
I hope for your sake
Something gets in the way

How long can you stand
Living under the lens
The kiss of success
The ensuing, all consuming, mess

Message of love
They arrive everyday
People you touch
Wasting away
People you don't know
Give you no choice

And you're sick to your stomach
At the sound of your voice
And the shape of your face
And the sound of your name
They send you pictures of yourself
It's someone you don't know
And they call you a genius
Cause you're easier to sell
But the fire in your belly
That gave you the songs
Is suddenly gone
And you feel like a fake
Is that what you want?
I hope for your sake..

You've got what it takes
You've got what it takes

Marillion,"I'm the man of a thousand faces
A little piece of me in every part I take
I hold the tape for a thousand races
A different point of view in every speech I make
Cut me a piece of my divided soul
Cry me a river, call it rock and roll
Give me an attitude and watch me make it lie
Pass me a microphone
I need to testify

Well I speak to machines with the voice of humanity
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity
Speak to the present in the past and future tense
Speak to a slave with the voice of obedience

I'm the man of a thousand ages
You see my face in the stones of the Parthenon
You hear my song in the babble of Babylon
I'm the man of a thousand riches
Be my guest at the feast of Satyricon
You spend the money that my logo's printed on

Well I'll speak to machines with the voice of humanity
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity
Speak to the present in the past and future tense
Speak to a slave with the voice of obedience

I stole a fire but it burned up much too soon
I took a leap and I landed on the moon
Look at my life and it looks like CNN
You see something once
You know it's gonna come around again

Well I'll speak to machines with the voice of humanity
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity
Speak to a woman with the fatal charm of a snake
Forgive like a giver and account for all I take
Yes, I speak to machines with the voice of humanity
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity
Speak like a leader with the voice of power and command

Marillion,"He's seen too much of life
And there's no going back
The loneliness calls him
And the edge which must be sharpened
He's losing it. And he knows.
But there's a fighter in his mind and his body's tough
The years have been unkind but kind enough

The smell of the earth
It's his favourite smell
But he's somehow compelled to the stinging salt hell
To the place where he hurts and he's scared
And there's no one to tell
And no one who doesn't listen

""You can take all the boys and the girls in the world
And I'll trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud
I've seen too much of life
So the sea is my wife and a sweet Ocean Cloud is a mistress I'm allowed
For now.""

""You can take all the boys and the girls in the world

For now.""

""Only me and the sea
We will do as we please.""

He remembers the day he was marched to the front
By the physical knuckle head teacher of games
'Look lads' he declared, ""This boy's a cream puff
No guts and no muscles
No spine and no stuffing""
The whole schoolroom sniggered
And silently thanked God it wasn't them..

But time is revenge. All the bullies grow weak
And must live with faithless women who despise them
I'll be in Barbados in a couple of weeks
With a rum on the table and yarns by the yard
A story to tell and a story to save
..unless she changes her mind
I'll trade them this morning for my sweet Ocean Cloud
I've seen to much of life so the sea is my wife
And the sweet ocean clouds will look down on my boat tonight

The wind changed
I felt it run beneath my ear
Like silk drawn across my neck
A dream of your legs
Defying gravity in love

The medium wave
Brought signals here from far away
Your tender voice riding on the sea spray
Something in the air
For those who know the signs
Something in the air
A storm..

When I was alive
When I was alive
Don't wanna remember
When I was alive

Watch me watch me
Paint this picture

Watch me
Takin it Takin it Takin it Takin it....
Watch me. Watch me. God above..

Between two planets
In between the points of light
Between two distant shorelines
Here am I

Between two planets
In the black daylight of space
Between two heavenly bodies
The invisible man.

I want to be alone

Marillion,"Well, she tied me to the headboard with a surf leash
And her wet hair hugged her body like a long lost friend
And I really tried my best to get across to her
But nothing she would say could be defended

Well, her birthday suit, it was her only present
When I looked into her eyes, no history
And I told her eating people wasn't pleasant
But she laughed a snake eye laugh and walked away from me

And I watched her as she walked across the coals
I watched her as she walked across the coals
I watched her as she walked across the coals

She was singing, I was born in nineteen sixty weird

And the waves rolled in across the bay
And the fabulous brightly colored birds
Flew up out of the forest

And she said, ""Well, we're all heaven's
Beautiful children living together in paradise
Lie down my dear, you're going to enjoy this""

Marillion,"Did you cry when they dragged you home?
Put a lock on the door and the telephone
Was a runaway girl all they could see?

Have the nights and the days that you've come through
Made the right seem wrong and the false seem true
Was a runaway girl all they could see?
A teenage extra from the satellite TV

Runaway girl
Too bad, too bad
Runaway girl
Too wild, too wild

Were they deaf to the prayer behind your lies?
Maybe they didn't dare to ask you why
Was a runaway girl all they chose to see?

You're tryin' to make your mind up if you're better off

You pretend to wait for washing in some Laundromat
But you're damned if you'll give them the satisfaction of you going back
You'd freeze to death before you'd share a roof with them
And you'd starve before you'd let him get his hands on you again

Like the past in a present

And you can't have them back
Because the time for them has gone
And their time has gone with them

An echo of  the time they were wrapped in

Marillion,"And it was morning.
And I found myself mourning,
For a childhood that I thought had disappeared.
I looked

Out the window,
And I saw a magpie in the rainbow, the rain
Had gone
I'm not alone, I turned to the mirror,

I saw you, the child, that once loved.
The child before they
Broke his heart,
Our heart, the heart that I believed was

Lost.
Hey you, surprised? More than surprised,
To find the answers to the questions,
Were always in your

Own eyes.
Do you realize that you give it on back to her?
But that would only be retraced in all the problems that you ever knew,
So untrue.

For she's got to carry on with her life,
And you've got to carry on with yours.
So I see it's me, I can
Do anything

And still the child,
'Cause the only thing misplaced was direction
And I found
Direction.

There is no Childhood's End.

Friend.

'Cause' you are my childhood friend.
Oh lead me on.
Hey you, you've survived.
Now you've arrived,

To be reborn in the shadow of the
Magpie.
Now you realize, that you've got to get out of
Here.

You've found the leading light of destiny,
Burning in the ashes of your memory.
You want to change
The world.

You'd resigned yourself to die a broken rebel,
But that was looking backward.
Now you've found the
Light.

You, the child that once loved,
The child before they broke his heart.
The heart, the heart
That I believed was lost

So it's me I see, I can do
Anything.
I'm still the child.

Only thing misplaced was direction, and I found direction.

And I don't give a damn, for the fleet street aficionados

I don't want launderette anonymity
I want my hand prints in the concrete on Sunset Boulevard
A dummy in Tussauds, you'll see

Incommunicado, incommunicado
Incommunicado, incommunicado

I'm a marquee veteran a multi-media bonafide celebrity
I've got an allergy to Perrier, daylight responsibility
I'm a rooting tooting cowboy, a Peter Pan with street credibility
Always taking the point with the dawn patrol fraternity

Sometimes it seems like, I've been here before
When I hear, opportunity kicking in my door
Call it synchronicity, call it 'Deja Vu'
I just put my faith in destiny, is the way that I choose

But, I don't want to be a tin can tied
To the bumper of a wedding Limousine
Or currently residing in the where are they now file
A toupee on the cabaret scene
I wanna do adverts for American Express cards
Talk shows on prime time TV
A villa in France, my own cocktail bar
And that's where you're gonna find me

On a Sunday in Milwaukee in the rain
Tryin' to piece together conversations
Tryin' to find out where to lay the blame

But when it comes right down to it there's no use tryin' to pretend
For when it gets right down to it there's no one here that's left to blame
Blame it on me, you can blame it on me
We're just sugar mice in the rain

I heard Sinatra callin' me down through the floorboards
Where you pay a quarter for a partnership in rhyme
To the jukebox cryin' in the corner
While the waitress is countin' out the time

For when it gets right down to it there's no use tryin' to pretend
For when it gets right down to it there's no one really left to blame
Blame it on me, oh you can blame it on me
We're just sugar mice in the rain

'Cause I know what I feel, know what I want, I know what I am
Daddy took a rain check
'Cause I know what I want, know what I feel, I know what I need
Daddy took a rain check, your Daddy took a rain check
Ain't no one in here that's left to blame but me
Blame it on me, blame it on me

Well the toughest thing that I ever did was talk to the kids on the phone
When I heard them asking questions I knew that you were all alone
Can't you understand that the government left me out of work?
I just couldn't stand the looks on their faces sayin', 'What a jerk!'

So if you want my address it's number one at the end of the bar
Where I sit with the broken angels
Clutchin' at straws and nursin' our scars
Blame it on me, blame it on me

Marillion,"On promenades where drunks propose
To lonely arcade mannequins
Where ceremonies pause
At the jewelers shop display
Feigning casual silence
In strained romantic interludes
Till they commit themselves
To the muted journey home

And the pool player rests on another cue
Last nights hero picking up his dues
A honeymoon gambled on a ricochet
She's staring at the brochures at the holidays
Chalking up a name in your hometown
Standing all your mates to another round
Laughing at the world till the barman wipes away
The warm wet circles, the warm wet circles

I saw teenage girls like gaudy moths
A classrooms shabby butterflies
Flirt in the glow of stranded telephone boxes
Planning white lace weddings from smeared hearts
And token proclamations
Rolled from stolen lipsticks
Across the razored webs of glass

Sharing cigarettes with experience
With her giggling jealous confidantes
She faithfully traces his name
With quick bitten fingernails
Through the tears of condensation
That'll cry through the night
As the glancing headlights of the last bus
Kiss adolescence goodbye

In a warm wet circle
Like a mothers kiss on your first broken heart
A warm wet circle
Like a bullet hole in central park
A warm wet circle
And I'll always surrender
To the warm wet circles

She nervously undressed
In the dancing beams of the Fidra lighthouse
Giving it all away before it's too late
She'll let a lovers tongue move in, in a warm wet circle
Giving it all away, showing no shame
She'll take a mother's kiss
On her first broken heart, a warm wet circle
She'll realize that she played her part in a warm wet circle","Warm Wet Circles [7"" Version]"

Found a heart in the gutter and a poet's crown
I felt barbed wire kisses and icicle tears

You can't take a photograph of Uzis on a street corner
The DJ resigned today they wouldn't let him have his say
Surface scratched where the needles play, Uzis on a street corner

Where do we go from here

Terror in Rue de St. Denis, murder on the periphery
Someone else in someone else's pocket
Christ knows I don't know how to stop it
Poppies at the cenotaph, the cynics can't afford to laugh
I heard in on the telegraph there's Uzis on a street corner

The more I see, the more I hear, the more I find fewer answers
I close my mind, I shout it out but you know it's getting harder
To calm down, to reason out, to come to terms with what it's all about
I'm uptight, can't sleep at night, I can't pretend everything's all right
My ideals, my sanity, they seem to be deserting me
But to stand up and fight I know we have six million reasons

They're burning down the synagogues, Uzis on a street corner
The heralds of the holocaust, Uzis on a street corner
The silence never louder than now, how quickly we forgot our vows
This resurrection we can't allow, Uzis on a street corner

We buy fresh bagels from the corner store
Where swastikas are spat from aerosols
I sit in the bar sipping iced White Russian
Trying to score but nobody's pushing
And everyone looks at everyone's faces
Searching for signs and praying for traces of a conscience in residence
Are we sitting on a barbed wire fence
Racing the clouds home, racing the clouds home

We place our faith in human rights
In the paper wars that tie the red tape tight
I know that I would rather be out of this conspiracy
In the gulags and internment camps frozen faces in nameless ranks
I know that they would rather be standing here besides me

I can feel the outside feeding on my inside
Leaves a growing darkness in it's place

I think I have become one of the lonely
Now that everybody talks to me
I feel I have become one of the empty

Hollow men can stop you with the twinkling of an eye
Hollow men can take you without even reaching out
Hollow men have got you long before you realise

The poison paralyses

I think I have become one of a pair of men

I look down upon myself and watch my movements
A blind eye sees the fragile vandalised

Watch this cold world dishing up these endless hollow men
Find us anywhere you look
Come and meet our friends
Stand us in our silly clothes
Put our batteries in
Line us up like fairground ducks
Watch us grin and grin
See the lies behind our eyes
See the will to win
We'll buy you and we'll sell you
But perhaps we'll save your skin

Falling towards something out of control
Unable to miss like the man in a tram

He just wrecked it and kept going

Is the meaningless slew
Falls away from your feet

Marilyn Horne,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end,
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're sio close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

When dawn comes to waken me,
You're never there at all!
I know you've forsaken me
Till the shadows fall,
But then once again I can dream, I've the right
To be close to you all through the night.",All Through the Night

Marilyn Manson,"The ancient pharaohs were not too bright they say,
But they made one contribution that I live by to this day,
It's the food pyramid,
And its approved the USDA

Oh grains of the foundation,
So please take my advice,
Of five to eleven servings of bread, cereal or rice,
Three to five of vegetables,
And four fruits is best,
Their antioxidensty fiber help you to digest,
Three servings of yogurt, milk and cheese,
Will help your bones and subsidize the cattle industry

A body needs to grow,
And grow and take regimes,
Why meat can be a tasty treat,
Like fish or even beans

And when you eat your sweets,
Make sure you try,
To limit your servings,
Or you'll

Die!

Marilyn Manson,"Paranoid, sitting in a deep sweat
Thinking I gotta fuck somebody before the week ends
The sight of blood excites me, shoot you in the head 
Sit down, and watch you bleed to death
I hear the sound of your last breath
Shouldn't have been around, I went all the way left
You was in the right place with me at the wrong time
I'm a psychopath, in a minute lose my fucking mind
Calm down, back to reality
Don't fear death, cause I know that it's promised to me
Flashes, I get flashes of Jason
Gimme a knife, a million lives I've wasted
The shadow of death follows me, I don't give a fuck
(In a mind of a lunatic)
Pussy play Superman, your ass'll get boxed up
Put him in a straight jacket, the man's sick
This is what goes on in the mind of a lunatic

Lookin through her window, now my body is warm
She's naked, and I'm a peepin tom
Her body's beautiful, so I'm thinking rape
Shouldn't have had her curtains open, so that's her fate
Leaving out her house, grabbed the bitch by her mouth
Drug her back in, slammed her down on the couch
Whipped out my knife, said, ""If you scream, I cut you""
Opened her legs and commenced the fucking
She begged me not to kill her so I gave her a rose
Then slit her throat and watched her shake till her eyes closed
(In a mind of a lunatic)
Had sex with the corpse before I left her
And drew my name on the wall like helter skelter
Run for shelter never crossed my mind
I had a gauge, a grenade, and even a nine
Dial 911 for the bitch
But the cops ain't shit
When they're fucking with a mind of a lunatic

I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles
Dreaming of the people I've dismantled
I close my eyes and in the circle 
Appears the images of sons of bitches that I murdered
Flashbacks of bodies being fucked up
Once I attack, I'm like a pit on a rage that's going nuts
Boys used to die when I'm full fo that fry
I be ebbin when I'm high 
So I say 'fuck' and just let bullets fly
(In a mind of a lunatic)
Like I said before, Scarface is my identity
A homicidal maniac with sucidal tendencies
I'm on the violent tip, so yo get a grip
And bitch, better come equipped, ain't taking no shit 
Cause here comes a mind of a lunatic

My girl's getting skinny, she's strung out on coke
So I went to her mother's house and cut out her throat
Her grandma was standing there, she was screaming out
As she reached for the telly, I put the blade on granny's ass
Went to the back and grabbed a shovel
Now granny's on her way to meet the devil
Pulled out my 38 and aimed at the bitch
A cop says Freeze, mutherfucker ! Bitch, suck my dick
(Mind of a lunatic)
I said, ""Die muthafucker !"" as I blasted 
Something clicked in my head, visions of bodies in plastic
The scent of buckshots in human flesh
Pigs dying from bullet wounds to the chest
No sheriff's gonna take me on a road
Dark as fuck, and let his pistols explode
Fuck that, cause I ain'ts to die
So I reloaded my Uzi and fired up another fry
It got me crazy as fuck
A ragin psychotic full of that Angel's Dust
The cops had the place surrounded 
Hunted for a way to get out - and I found it
Innocent bystanders watch me set an example
I popped one, ""Let me go, goddammit
Scot free
Or all of these mutherfuckers coming with me""
(In A Mind of a lunatic)
All of a sudden the shit got silent
I remember waking up, in an asylum
Being treated like a troubled kid
My shirt was all bloody, and both of my wrists was slit
Think this is harsh? This ain't as harsh as it gets
No telling what's being thought up in the mind of a lunatic

Janurary 5th 1969
A damn fool was born with the mind of a lunatic
I shoulda been killed
But sister fucked around and let me live
Now I developed a criminal behaviour
Fuck with me, and I'll slay your ass 
Beyond recognition, shit
Your dental records couldn't prove your identity, bitch
I beg your pardon, on talking to borden
You'll never find a mutherfucker, so save your milk cartons
(In A Mind of a lunatic)
Cross the line, your ass is mine
I don't give a fuck if you're 9 or 99
Blind, crippled, and crazy, don't faze me
Your funky ass will be pushing up daisies
You wanna know what makes me click?
My psychiatrist said I got the mind of a lunatic

I ain't got it all, so don't fuck with me
Unless your ass wanna be made history
I'll blow your mutherfucking house up
And if your wife and kids are inside, they're fucked 
I don't give a damn who I slay
Don't let me get a hold of some E&J
Cause when the shit hit the fan
I'll stab your ass quicker than a Mexican
The nightmares I leave you with on the scene

And the hole is where the heart is
We built this tomb together; I will fill it alone

And just another girl left in tears

Waiting
With the sound turned off, I'm waiting
Like a glass balloon, I'm fading
Into the void and then I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

Waiting
Waiting
I'm fading
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

I'll take you back inside
If they came for answer I'll
Weap my claws round your mouth tight

Until there's nothing left to hide
And they can all drown in our blood

Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!

The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?

Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop

Drivin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!

Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droppin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!

The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,

Marilyn McCoo,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

The music playing?
How do you make it last
How do keep
The song from fading
Too fast

How do you lose yourself
To someone
And never lose your way
How do you not run
Out of new things
To say

And since you know
We're always changing
How can it be the same
And tell me how
Year after year
You're sure your heart
Will fall apart
Each time
You hear her name

I know the way
I feel for you
Is now or never
The more
I love the more
There I'm afraid
That in yours eyes
I may not see forever

You make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
Make me feel brand new

Whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me

With you I'll always have a friend

When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair.

From their vast mysterious sky

The moon don't shine
The tide don't ebb and flow
A clock won't strike
A match won't light

And day is dark as night

And a woman's sorry sight

When love goes wrong
Nothing goes right
When love goes wrong
Nothing goes, nothing goes right

A man goes out, gets high as a kite

You can't fight it, honey
You can't fight it
When love goes wrong, nothin'
No bows, honey, just cigat bars and off

Marilyn Monroe,"A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello

In your blue serge pants,
I never get the chance, this is a fine romance!

A find romance, my friend this is
To lack half the thrills that a healthy crime has

I'll never fall again
Said adieu to love
Don't ever call again

And so I'm through with love

I've locked my heart
I'll keep my feelings there
I've stocked my heart
With icy, frigid air
And I mean to care for no one
Because I'm through with love

Why did you lead me to think you could care?
You didn't need me, you had your share
Of slaves around you to hound you and swear
With deep emotion, devotion to you

Goodbye to spring and all it meant to me
It can never bring the thing that used to be
For I must have you or no one
And so I'm through with love

The way you're acting lately makes me doubt 
You is still my baby, baby 

Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out

he's gone and made a change

Or is my baby still my baby true ",Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby?

I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

But love is old
And while I'm waiting here

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Marilyn Scott,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

After it brought my lover near

Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day

Marilyn Scott,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Chez nous on s‚Äôentra√Æne √† tirer sur des Oliver Kahn
J'ai comme l'impression de me perdre, tous les jours √† force de cotoyer la merde
J'tourne en rond tous les jours j'en ai la gerb'
La v√©rit√© c'est qu'en v√©rit√© niquez vos p√®res
Sors le tournevis, direction le 32 bis
Hors de question tu te pisses dessus
Chez nous pas de novices
C'est sign√© Marin Monster, j'tourne apr√®s les ronds comme Rudy Voleur
Seine Saint Denis c'est l'moteur, ma groupie a les yeux fig√©s sur l'compteur
Poto c'est maintenant qu'il faut brancher les gens
J'veux que double MC se propage dans ta r√©gion
C'est quand t'as le gava que tu te fais √©craser
Et que malheureusement ils jalousent sur la taille de tes jantes
Tous les jours j'rencontre des thos-my, ferme l√†, intercepte le colis
J'suis un z√®bre √©lev√© au couscous, oui en moi y'a du m'boli
B√¢tard vas-y d√©panne un bon pt'cit coup
J'reste solidaire comme (?)
On va te faire courir m√™me avec une arme factice
Aujourd'hui les meufs ont toutes le profil d'une actrice
J'suis pas le genre mec √† c√©der √† tes caprices
Nous on t'√©clate la gueule comme Quarteron Patrice

Se faire niquer par une chatte, √ßa fait un mal de chien
Quand t'es seul rien qu'tu aboies, mais bizarrement l√† j'vois qu'tu miaules hein
Se prendre en photo, montrer son boule, est-ce vraiment l'objectif?

C'est pas les fonds de vos caisses mais les fonds marins nous qu'on extorque
√áa jacte trop dans mon davo, autant que 600 pouls

Gotta new love, gotta new love tonight 
Gotta new love, gotta new love tonight 
New love, new love 

You came into my life, took one look in your eyes 
And I knew there'd be no more cryin'. , 
I can hear myself fall, whenever you call my name 
You make me feel like dyin' now 

I never knew how much I longed for 
Someone quite like you 
You're what I've been waitin for all my life; it's true 
So hear me say 

I felt weak in the knees, when you said ""won't you please"" 
Take my hand cause I feel like dancin' 
I could feel my heart pound, overcome by the sound 
Of the music in your romancin' arms 

Your's are the one's I long to care for 
They make me feel just right 
You've given me so much more 
Here in just one night; so I'm burstin' to say

Where we all learn right from wrong 
So just sit back tonight 
And let me rock you this song 
I'll sing the words just for you 

Hold on, hold on, I won't let you go 
I'll make you safe tonight 
Help you to be feeling right 
Hold on, hold on now, hold on 
I want you to know 
I'll spend my lifetime 
Healing your pain, are you lost 
Oh, you lonely child 

So come in close and tight 
Now I won't do you no harm, no 
I'll wrap you up tonight 
And make you feel nice and warm, I will

Shoot me up, bring me down, get me spinnin' all around

Your love's just one of a kind 
No matter what the weather 
As long as we're together 
Your kiss can make the sunshine 
So just put your arms around me 
Blue sky is what we'll both see 

You're sweeter than apple pie 
Give me one juicy bite, just before we say goodnight 
Let my sugar rise, take me up sky high 
Lift me up, make me fly, just fill me up and try to 

I want much more than goodtimes 
So come on and let the world see 
Tomorrow's where we'll both be 
Don't want nobody else 
So don't let me go boy, never

Your fingers might clutch 
Your heart, it may break

Forever running wild
In the human race

Another day, another tale of rape
Another ticking bomb to bury deep and detonate

I'm not afraid of God
I'm afraid of Man

You can see it on the news
You can watch it on TV
You can read it on your phone
You can say it's troubling
Humans aren't gonna behave
As we think we always should
Yeah, we can be bad as we can be good

Underneath it all, we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
How could we expect anything at all
We're just animals, still learning how to crawl
Underneath it all, we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
Truth is in us all, cradle to the grave
We're just animals still learning to behave

All the hate coming out from a generation
Who got everything, and nothing guided by temptation
Were we born to abuse, shoot a gun and run
Or has something deep inside of us come undone?
Is it a human trait, or is it learned behavior
Are you killing for yourself, or killing for your savior?

Underneath it all, we‚Äôre just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
How could we expect anything at all?
We‚Äôre just animals still learning how to crawl
Underneath it all, we‚Äôre just savages

I'm obsessed with silence
I go home and I lock my door
I can hear the sirens

And I listen to the wind blow
I see people and cars covered in gold

White like a diamond, black like coal

They'll always leave too soon
But a memory, a memory
Can make a flower bloom
We wanna be remembered
Don't wanna live in vain
But nothing lasts forever
This world is in a losing game

I wanna mean something to somebody else
Feel a significance in the real world
It's not enough to live out a lucky life

No I don't wanna be afraid,
Afraid to die, die, die
I just wanna be able to say
That I have lived my life, life
Oh, all the things that humans do
To leave behind a little proof
But the only thing that doesn't die is love, love, love
Love, love

√© porque eu n√£o quero que nada aconte√ßa
Deve ser porque
Eu n√£o ando bem da cabe√ßa

Marina Lima,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Uma Noite E 1/2

It's hard workin'
Sometimes I just want to 
Go home and tell my girl to?

Braid my hair
C'mon and braid my hair
Back in my 'hood
Feeling good 
No worries or no cares
Baby use your hands
To make me feel alright
And take away the stress and drama
In my life
While you braid my hair

You may think that I'm complaining
But that's not the case
All I'm sayin'
Is my body gets weak
My mind gets tired
I need sleep
But I gotta keep
Traveling on the road
Doing these shows
New York to Cali
Dallas to Philly
It's the rules of the game
That I chose to play
But sometimes I wanna say?

Braid my hair
C'mon and braid my hair
Back in my 'hood
Feeling good 
No worries or no cares
Baby use your hands
To make me feel alright
And take away the stress and drama
In my life
While you braid my hair

Sit me down like you love me
Do it anyway you want
Baby, take it slowly
Front to back, side to side
Crisscross 
Get creative wit it
Girl, do your thang
Put it down like you love me
Let your fingers do the walkin'
And your lips do the talkin'
In my ear tell me what I wanna hear
I swear I can't wait for you to?

Braid my hair
C'mon and braid my hair

Imagine jersey and trash

I give nothing but the best
For my baby

'Cause I believe
She represents me
Completely head to her feet
Out here on these streets

You can't get caught
It's all you fault if she leaves

You chose to
Spend it on your clothes and kicks
Instead of dinner and a flick you picked
The opposite

This is what you get
She bout to have a fit
That when I pulled over in the rover
Offered her my shoulder

Get a little closer smash
Off with your girl like that
You cant get mad

[Chorus]
You didn't handle your buis-
That's why I got your whiz
You should have listened when she mentioned your to busy wit your friends
Now you want her back
Sorry it's too late for that
She's happy where she's at
And that's that
That's the way it is
Yeah I've got your whiz

Tennis bracelet in blue
Even bought your sister one too
Just to name a few things you could do
To put a smile on her face

Card on her birthday
Anniversary of the first day we met
Never forget her favorite color
Little things to show how much you love her

You chose to
Spend it on your clothes and kicks
Instead of dinner and a flick you picked
The opposite
This is what you get
She bout to have a fit
That when I pulled over in the rover
Offered her my shoulder
Get a little closer smash
Off with your girl like that
You cant get mad

You made it easy
For me to steal your breezy
I see it
Please believe me

She hates to be unfaithful
But you made her
She's trying
She'll come to me and I'll get

Right down to it

Mario,"It's kinda crazy baby,
How I remember things (like where you came from and how you had nothin)
I went and made you fly,
Put extras on your ride, (didn't miss a birthday now you can't even remember mine)

You made it clear to me (you wasn't down for me),
(I may be blind baby) but now I see,
(You had things up your sleeve, don't even lie to me)
I even heard it from your family,

How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I thought you?
How could you put him up to the ghetto kama sutra?
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?

You must be out your mind,
You got a lot of nerve
(To think that I'm gon chill after all that shit I heard),
I damn near carried you,
I could've married you,
Good thing I found out before I bought that seven carat for you,
(I know you're sick about) the way I found you out,
(Go ahead and pack it out)
I hope he got romance in his house,
You should have thought of me before you hopped in the sheets,
Damn I can't believe that you did this to me

How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?

Can't believe the ways you repaid me,
Girl you had it all,
But I guess my all wasn't good enough for you,
Baby I've accepted it,
And I ain't goin' trip,
Girl I'm movin' on,
Sometimes I give up and think that another man's gonna get the one that's in for me

How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I thought you?
How could you put him up to the ghetto kama sutra?
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?

How could you how could you just go and lay there,
How could you how could just give him everything,

Just relieve your stress (relax) chill your ring finger
And freeze ya chest
Cop you a new beamer the beads is next
And even though it's a want I need the sex
I hope it's just insecurity
'cause' I know she feelin' me
Diggin the growth and the maturity
But I got hard luck
'cause' honey keep keepin' her guards up
So I'm just tryna' even the odds up
And that part sucks to have to keep goin' back in on her
When she knows that I been on her
Since Back in the days in Manhattan after the matin√©e
When she just happened to wave
That's when I knew she had the right shine (right shine)
And the right mind (right mind)
It's just on me to catch her at the right time (right time)
When I get her imma' grab her by the wrist
Pull her close to me, hug her and tell her this...

[Chorus]
Baby you should let me love you, let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby good love and protection

Baby I just don't get it, do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smell the perfume, the make up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories you know that they are all lies
As bad as you are you stick around and I just don't know why
If I was you man baby you'd (never worry about)
What I do (I'd be coming home)
Back to you (every night doing you right)
Your the type of woman (deserves good things)
Fist full of diamonds (hand full of rings)

What you want a cruise?
Avenues and a ride with a pair of shoes
Shining like a diamond sittin' high with raised latitude
(Ah ha) listen baby I could change your attitude
You chillin' with the king you ain't dealin' with them rapper dudes
(Hey) keep it real kick it with me is what you rather do
I was poppin' before you, gonna' be the same after you
In case you wonderin' I'm stuntin' and way major
If the ice don't matter, and the money don't phase you,
Cars don't impress you, I bet the sex will amaze you
Look you don't want to past the chance (hey)
Spend the summer in the bottom half of France
Don't be alarmed I don't mean no harm
I'll help you before I hurt you
I'm tryna' rebirth you
I want to love you
I ain't just have to nail you
You already know I can show you
Better than I can tell you

Mario,"We've had such a great time
In these past 2 months I've never laughed so much in my life
Its bin all about us 
Since that time we had that intimate talk
Suddenly your acting strange
Plus your conversation just stopped n changed
Is it because your afraid
That what your feelin' for me 
Is the beginning of a new heart break 
Hear me when I say

You ain't gotta give me your love
You ain't gotta say am yours
You ain't gotta tell me where you been
Cause you ain't obligated to me
Am not sayin' that you should just rush an give me your heart
Am just askin' that you
Like me real hard
Just like me real hard

You know jus' like I know 
We've bin broken by love an we both need time to heal 
That's why in this short amount of time
We've grown so close 
You relate to everything I feel
So lets not complicate things 
By place' in titles on you and i
But what we can do before we make the next move
We gotta find a perfect reason why
So believe me when I say

You ain't gotta give me your love
You ain't gotta say am yours
You ain't gotta tell me where you been
Cause you ain't obligated to me
Am not sayin' that you should just rush an give me your heart
Am just askin' that you
Like me real hard
Just like me real hard

You ain't ready to fall in love
And I ain't ready to care so much
We ain't ready for commitment right now
But together we can work something out
And we'll know when the time is right
Because we'll feel it in our heart
And will be written in the stars
But for now 
Just like me real hard

You ain't gotta give me your love
You ain't gotta say am the one baby
You ain't gotta tell me where you been

What have I missed,
Living like this?
Who'd think I'd get this far,
Fancy house and my fancy car
Why you living like this?
Together as kids,
You were my best of friend,
All the trouble you got up in

[Bridge]
See I been deaf, and I been scared,
I been discriminated against and compared,
To you whose my brother, thanks to you I discovered
There's only one way to go in life and that's be right

There's only one way to do right, right, right, right,
There's only one way to do right, right, right, right,
See me, I ain't always done right, right, right, right,
That's why I'm here to help you fight, fight, to do right

[Verse 2]
You were the queen in my future,
I was the one you was used to,
It was like we were one,
Up under the sun
And narcotics in your system,
The love I should have unlisted,
Now look what we've become,
But I shouldn't judge

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Cause in life there are decisions to make but it's your choice,
But I chose to walk away, rather than wildin' out, and get locked away
See my friends all chose the fast money, but I chose my father
Cause I knew he'd come for me and recover me, already dead
See what I'm trying to say, is I'm trying to be the best man I can be
And when I see you too, struggling to do the best you can do
You may run into a rock, but you can't let it stop what's planned for you,
So make the right choice

The more I lie about being at sessions and leaving at certain times,
She's like, ""Where you at?""
I'm at the studio at home,
and I'm thinking to myself we cut that record days ago
Cause shorty on the east side, hit me and want to know if I could stop by,
Now I'm contemplating what I am gonna say, bout this being the umpteenth time that I'm late

I'm trying to save our love the best way that I can,

And I really wanna make it work, but I cant stop messing round,
I keep doing dirt,

The more I want to tell them that I'm not involved,
With anyone, when I know it's you,
Wanna tell the truth but it's just so hard to do,
Caught up in me again it's driving me crazy
It's the reason I won't tell em i got a lady,

I want you to be my Louis Lane,
Girl I promise I'm gonna change, and it ain't gonna be this way forever,
Girl I'm gonna get myself together, cause your the one I love,
Because your like a drug that I can't get enough of,
I'm just so confused, don't know what to do,
Cause the way that it's feeling, I like how it's feeling,
It's getting so hard, to fight that feeling

[Rap: Rich Boy]
I'm a rich boy riding in my big superstar shit,
The one girls try to get they text me on my sidekick
Bring em to my palace, tell em take it off we make a flick,
Every night I do it so at least one chick I gotta get
Just like kryptonite them girls make me super weak,
Suck my dick and play with me until they put me straight to sleep,
Twenty girls on my sheets, seven days out the week,
It's hard trying to hold it down with groupies trying to get with me,
I stay dreaming, fantasizing, with my eyes closed,
I love you girl but I'm addicted to them hoes
If ballin' is a sin then God please forgive me,
My women so bad and my money so filthy really

And let me give you what homie wasn't able to give

Don't be scared about it
Go on and put your hands around it
Damn, you put your hands around it
Girl, what you're doin'

If I play with that, think about it
Do that lil' thing around it
Don't you dare try to leave without this
Just keep doin' what you're doin'

Don't, don't take it out, baby, don't take it out
You could take as much time as you want, take it out
Trust me, I won't hit that and be gone
Just fulfill all your needs

[Chorus]

Damn, shawty got it goin' on
From her head to her clothes, how she throw it on
But I'm tryin' to see her take it off
It's like football, I plan on goin' long, hut hut

I plan on goin' deep
You the ground, I'm the casket, I'm goin' six feet
Yeah, baby, I'm a fully loaded freak
One in the head, don't make me bust off my piece

Them other dudes soft like sheets
Me, I'm tryin' to get you on my sheets
Tobago shorts say 'pink'
Oh, those Victoria's Secrets

And I know how to keep a secret
So I won't tell nobody what we did
No but we could chill and pop Heavy bottles
We can ride in the Phantom while the Bentley follows

[Chorus]

Let me watch you 'cause I can be the man
You wanna come home to, baby
That'll do anything that you need
Oh baby, oh please, let me watch you",Let Me Watch
Mario,"[Verse 1]
I'm not your man we're more than friends
We make love but I don't call you my lover
I do for you, you do for me
It works because we don't smother each other
It's short and sweet the time we spent
We can't take a second of it for granted
No
I barely understand it
Not the way I planned it
Why can't it just be what it is?

What's in a name if we got what we need
Ain't nobody comin' between us but me
Everything I told you about my love I mean
I said everything that I said I mean

We shop, we dine, spend cuddle time
Come over but only on invitation
Not now in time we're border line
I like you but don't quit your occupation

Let's stay open to other situations
Why tell you we gone be more

But it's time I put on my cape and
Put that S on my chest

I know when you love him and you wanna make it work
And I can't help but think that I known you first

Starting over is so hard
Seems like everywhere I try to go
I keep thinking of you

I just had a wake up call
Should have never let you fall
Baby, you were not the blame at all
When I'm the one that pushed you away

Baby if you knew I care
You wouldn't have never went nowhere

It's been all about us
Since that time we had
That intimate talk

Plus your conversation
Just upped and changed
Is it because your afraid
What you feelin' for me

Is the beginning of a
New heart break?

You know just like I know
We've been broken by love
And we both need time to heal
That's why

In this short amount of time
We've grown so close
'Cause you relate to
Everything I feel

So let's not complicate things
By placing titles on you and I

Before we make the next move

We gotta find the perfect
Reason why

Mario,"I'm sick and tired of friends with benefits,
There were too many goodbyes,
And I can't say I was so innocent,
Cause I told my share of lies,
But it seems like whenever I get close to her,
Love would just be away,
But just when I thought my chances were over,
I stared my future in the face.

I looked at main girl in the eye,
And since then I've been paralyzed,
Something told me she'd be mine,
And I knew it before she said hi(before she said hi)
Hi(hi) hi(hi) hi(hi)
And I knew it before she said hi

I made a lot of broken promises,
I had no respect for words,
And I thought I got all that I'm against,
Until I ran into her,
She whispers to me and it pulls me closer,
Now I can't stay away,
And now I feel like all my pain is over,
I stared my future in the face.

I looked at main girl in the eye,
And since then I've been paralyzed,
Something told me she'd be mine,
And I knew it before she said hi(before she said hi)
Hi, hi, hi
And I knew it before she said hi

I had a feeling before she said hi,
And she told him bye,
My gift from god,
Fallen star from the sky,
Fell in love the first look at her eyes,
?
Doing her wrong she keep doing her own,
Now I'm taking her home little goose and patron,
Let's get it on,
Turn off your phone let's get blown,
In the zone?
?
You without me is like cash without tango,
Forget about the cash life no longer painful,
Look what we came to

I done changed boo and for that I wanna thank you,

I looked at main girl in the eye,
And since then I've been paralyzed,
Something told me she'd be mine,
And I knew it before she said hi(before she said hi)
Hi, hi, hi
And I knew it before she said hi",Before She Said Hi

Never knew that what was 
Wrong, oh, baby, wasn't right

Mario Frangoulis,"At seventeen the bridge of dreams
Can reach across forever
A long weekend, my mother's friend
You came in search of weather

The women I saw, I'd seen years before
But never like this
Your kiss on my cheek, said
""Find if you seek a moment of bliss""

I'll never forget you, don't ever regret you
You opened my eyes
Wherever I go in this world, as I stumble on shifting sand
You were there, when a boy turned man

Secretly it had to be
Though honest was our passion
And every moment in your arms
Made mockery of fashion

And after the glow
The talk of the soul
Will stay deep inside

I'll never forget you, I'll always respect you
You opened my eyes
Whatever I do in this life
As I battle against the tide

I'll never forget you, I'll always respect you
You opened my eyes
Wherever I go in this world, as I stumble on shifting sand
You were there, when a boy turned man

You were there, when a boy turned man
You were there, when this boy turned man
You were there, when this boy turned man
You were there, when this boy turned man

Mario Frangoulis,"Never knew I could feel like this
Like I've never seen the sky before
Want to vanish inside your kiss
Everyday I love you more and more

Listen to my heart, can you hear it sings?
Telling me to give you everything
Seasons may change winter to spring
But I love you until the end of time

Come what may, come what may
I will love you until my dying day

Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place
Suddenly it moves with such a perfect grace
Suddenly my life doesn't seem such a waste
It all revolves around you

And there's no mountain too high, no river too wide
Sing out this song and I'll be there by your side
Storm clouds may gather and stars may collide
But I love you until the end of time

Come what may, come what may
I will love you until my dying day
Oh, come what may, come what may
I will love you

Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place

You're safe with me

Let's dance like there's nobody watching
Sing as if no one is listening to what you're hearing
Love like you've never been hurt before
Try to forget if you can and just dance

I've known the coldest of nights, lay awake tryin' to stop myself dreaming
There in the emptiest space in my head the music stopped playing
Right now all I wanna do is lose myself in you and me
Just be

Let's dance like there's nobody watching
Sing as if no one is listening to what you're hearing
Love like you've never been hurt before
Try to forget if we can and just dance

Like we've never been scared of heights, no fear of falling

Leaves your heart so heavy
Every time you hear goodbye
You wonder will it ever end

But I still believe in love

Follow your heart
Wherever it takes you
Nobody knows
Where the wind blows
No one can say

Follow your dreams
Wherever they find you
Lost and alone, the light in the storm
Will always be with you
If you follow your heart

When the world's a little crazy
The truth's so hard to find
But I still believe in love

Follow your heart
Wherever it takes you
Nobody knows
Where the wind blows
No one can say

Follow your dreams
Wherever they find you
Lovers and friends, they fade in the end
But the love that's inside you
Grows stronger inside you

Will always be with you

And so do I!
Some think it well to be all melancholic,

But I, I love to spend my time in singing
Some joyous song;
To set the air with music bravely ringing
Is far from wrong!

Echoes sound afar! funiculi, funicula`.

Some think it wrong to set the feet a-dancing,
But not so I;
Some think that eyes should keep from coyly glancing
Upon the sly!
But oh! to me the mazy dance is charming,
Divinely sweet,
And surely there is nought that is alarming
In nimble feet?
Listen! Listen! music sounds afar!
Listen! Listen! music sounds afar!
Funiculi funicula`, funiculi funicula`,
Music sounds afar! funiculi, funicula`.

Ah me! 'tis strange that some should take to sighing,
And like it well;
For me, I have not thought it worth the trying,
So cannot tell!

Full soon is gone,
For mirth was made for joyous lads and lasses
To call their own!

The things you are saying to me

Just holding you here in my arms
With you every day's a beautiful day

Of an age the world has long forgotten
Of an age that weaves the silent magic in Granada today

For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along
Entranced by the beauty before me
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song
And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada
I envy the blush of the snow clad Sierra Nevada
For soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft Habanera
Then moonlit Granada will live again

Softer than starlight are you;
Warmer than winds of June are the gentle lips you gave me.

Sweeter than music are you;

And when your youth and joy invade my arms
And fill my heart, as now they do,
Younger than springtime am I,
Gayer than laughter am I,
Angel and lover, heaven and earth,
Am I with you.","Younger than Springtime, song (from ""South Pacific"")"
Mario Lanza,"Away in a manger, no crib for his bed,
the little Lord Jesus laid down his Sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,
And fit us for heaven, to live with thee there.",Away in a manger (Tune: Cradle Song) (New English Hymnal 22)

Of an age the world has long forgotten
Of an age that weaves the silent magic in Granada today

It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along

Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song
And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada

Tho' she may try to hide it,

So beguiles all who see her 
That they'd ride a mile

Do you remember, Love, the words we spoke
Have you forgotten all the tender vows we made
In the silent magical moonbeams' light
Gone are the golden dreams with summer roses

And broken melody of love and life

Colinette with the sea-blue eyes,
She is watching and longing, and waiting

As the wind in the boughs above,
She listens and starts and trembles,
'Tis the first little song of love.
 
Roses are shining in Picardy,
In the hush of the silver dew,
Roses are flow'ring in Picardy,
But there's never a rose like you!
And the roses will die with the summertime,
And our roads may be far apart,
But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy,
'Tis the rose that I keep in my heart
 
And the years fly on forever,
Till the shadows veil their skies,
But he loves to hold her little hands,
And look into her sea-blue eyes,
And she sees the road by the poplars,
Where they met in the bygone years,
For the first little song of the roses,
Is the last little song she hears:
 
Roses are shining in Picardy,
In the hush of the silver dew,
Roses are flow'ring in Picardy,

An invitation to moonlight and romance.
It's quite the fashion, The Continental,

And you are saying just what you're dreaming of.
So keep on dancing, The Continental,

Your voice is gentle and sentimental.
You stroll together arm in arm.

Mario Lanza,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands

Send the breeze beside the sea

Beneath the blossoms high above
You love me, in Valencia long ago
We found our paradise of love

In a magic dream of memory I see you again
In that old town far away beneath the skies of Spain
That city of plenty romances, so shy were your glances
And swiftly the sunshine that dances through the orange broad

Mario Lanza,"Granada, I'm falling under your spell
And if you could speak what a fascinating tale you would tell
Of an age the world has long forgotten
Of an age that weaves the silent magic in Granada today

The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along
Entranced by the beauty before me
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song
And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada
I envy the blush of the snow clad Sierra Nevada
For soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft Habanera
Then moonlit Granada will live again
The glory of yesterday romantic and gay.","Granada, for voice & orchestra"

In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live.

I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring

They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring

And the plentiful waste of time of day

How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee to-night.

For Christ is born of Mary,
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven.
No ear may hear his coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him, still
The dear Christ enters in.

Where children pure and happy
Pray to the blessed Child,
Where misery cries out to thee,
Son of the mother mild;
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door,
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
And Christmas comes once more.

O holy Child of Bethlehem!
Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin and enter in,
Be born in us to-day.
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell;
O come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel!",O Little Town of Bethlehem

Colinette with the sea-blue eyes,
She is watching and longing, and waiting
Where the long white roadway lies,
And a song stirs in the silence,
As the wind in the boughs above,
She listens and starts and trembles,
'Tis the first little song of love.
 
Roses are shining in Picardy,
In the hush of the silver dew,
Roses are flow'ring in Picardy,
But there's never a rose like you!
And the roses will die with the summertime,
And our roads may be far apart,
But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy,
'Tis the rose that I keep in my heart
 
And the years fly on forever,
Till the shadows veil their skies,
But he loves to hold her little hands,
And look into her sea-blue eyes,
And she sees the road by the poplars,
Where they met in the bygone years,
For the first little song of the roses,
Is the last little song she hears:
 
Roses are shining in Picardy,
In the hush of the silver dew,

Mario Lanza,"Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall,
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

('How do you think he does it?)
I don't know!
(What makes him so good?')

Well, he ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind kid,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

He's a pinball wizard,
His score's a trillion more.
A pinball wizard,
The world's new pinball lord.
He's scoring more!
He's scoring more!
More more more more!

I thought I was the Bally table king,
But I just handed my pinball crown to him.
To him!
To him!",Lolita

Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart,

You'll never walk alone.

I know I do but I don't know how

I pretend that I'm in control now
I won't fall down 'till I walk away
I say to myself you've got to be strong girl
I tell myself it's better that way

Mario Pelchat,"What do you do when you know something's bad for you
And you still can't let go?

I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping

Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
'Cause I, I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I should have known
I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke
It was all an illusion

Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)
But the venom seeps deeper(deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce
But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

Every time I try to grasp for air
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
Let it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming
Begging, pleading
No more

I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul
'Cause I can't let go

I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause I

Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back

How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading too fast?
How do you lose yourself to someone
And never lose your way?
How do you not run out of new things to say?
And since you know we're always changing
How can it be the same?
And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear his name?
I know the way I feel for you it's now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
That in your eyes I may not see forever, forever
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better as it grows
With any luck then I suppose

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel

Mario Schiano,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,
It had to be you, wonderful you,

Mario Stantchev,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble

Mario Vazquez,"Whoo 
I'm a boss so I hit her with the little head game 
I can tell she like to taste sweet things 
First thing I met her for sense a switch go 
Damn I been gone too long 
She know what the business was 
I told her to get at it 
Took the lead promo static 
Puerto Rican mix sweet tone 
Only promise she was with this cat standing six foot four
She said I ride my own (check) 
Go away (check) 
Don't worry bout it your just another pay (check) 
She said I ain't gotta ask anything I want (yet) 
I said what that's called when you move it like (that) 
She kept reiterating she had a thing for (sex) 
A man and another man she tried (yet) 
So I pulled back put it up another drink 
She like tell me what you think 
Gotta just take another puff 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
She wanna smoke Cohiba 
You gotta work for that 
Gotta work for that 
Can I smoke your Cohiba 
You gotta work for that 
Gotta work for that 
She wanna smoke my Cohiba 
You gotta work for that 
Gotta work for that
Can I smoke your Cohiba 
You gotta work for that

She told me not to think how could I hesitate 
Who would love the chance 
Just to give it to me 
I knew it the things I would do to her 
But I keep thinking me him and her 
But the obvious told me believe her 
Heard that she giving me the fever 
Slow up ma and kick back 
While I think about what I'm gon do with that

Mario Vazquez,"I hear the words you speak it's clearer every time
The middle, the end, the sound of every line
But do they mean a thing when defenses are stoppin' you
From saying everything that I need you to?

Do you know what it's like when it kills, it's a crime
When the one that you want is only speaking in empty rhymes
'Cause I want you, want you, want you, I've fallen over you
So don't tell me, tell me, tell me the sun will see the moon
When I need ya, need ya, need ya you make me wait in line
Just be cool tonight, don't lie

Oh, do you remember the first time when it was you and I
When lonely days and memories erased with time
And everything in front of us was ours to lose, yeah
But somewhere along the way you had to choose

Do you know what it's like when it kills, it's a crime
You tell me you want me but I don't see you standin' by
'Cause I want you, want you, want you, I've fallen over you
So don't tell me, tell me, tell me the sun will see the moon
But I need ya, need ya, need ya you make me wait in line
Just be cool tonight, don't lie (no, no)

Yeah, I thought you could be something more like the light in my life
But these barricades they get bigger and bigger time passes by
There's a web filled with holes and I can't stop myself I keep falling through
Just say anything, right now that should do

Oh, don't leave me
When you lose it

Do you know what it's like when it's gone, it's a crime
And it's so obvious but we know the truth's not kind
But I want you, want you, want you, I've fallen over you
So don't tell me, tell me, tell me the sun will see the moon
When I need ya, need ya, need ya don't make me wait in line
Just be cool tonight, don't lie
Just be cool tonight, don't lie",Don't Lie

Mario Vazquez,"Oh 

Three times this same week you been askin' to come to my crib 
Girl you got a problem and I know what it is 
You done got a little taste of incredible that's got you out of pocketing and you don't know why 
And it should come as know surprise 
That I got something that blows your mind 

I think it's the way that I move 
The things that I do 
That's a little different 
From the things that you did 
When your not here 
And that's why your trippin' 
I bet he don't 

[Chorus]
I bet he don't give you whatcha need 
I bet he don't give you watchu want 
Said I bet, said I bet he don't do it like me 
That's why you always trying to be alone 
I bet he don't kiss ya right 
Don't miss you right 
Don't handle his like I handle mine 
I bet he can't do it like me 
No, no, no, no baby 

So don't try to fight it 
You can't hide it from me, no 
What I said, tried to fix 
Everyday, you a hit 
You can't let it go 'cause your love is so 
Now you say your not sprung and any day you'll be through 
That's why I got 
Five missed calls on my phone 
And they all come from you 

I think it's the way that I move 
The things that I do 
And that's a little different 
From the things that you did 
When your not here 
And that's why your trippin' 
I bet he can't 

[Chorus]

Let me say one thing 
I know to be true 
That he don't understand your body 
Quite like I do 
And the feeling that you get is so ridiculous 
It's hard to quit 
Oh, I betcha he

And outta this place""

Wake up this morning said to myself 
Today will be the day I'm gonna ring on his bell 
Didn't have to ring 'cause he's standing outside 
As soon as I pulled up pure hate in his eyes 
I took a deep breath said what I had to say 
He looked at me and said ""Hey, you better stay away"" 
You and her together it'll never be ok 
I looked at him and said ""Ha""

Listen to this, girl if you give me one shot
I will love you forever now
No one will do you better now
Love is a risk but if you give me one shot,
I will show you you're the only girl in the world who can give me this feeling

I rather die than live without you
We can't miss so if you give me one shot
We can do it girl (do it girl)

I'm talking about love in the morning
Just like you want it
Anything you need you can call me for it

Now girl I'm only human, I'm full of many faults
I'm guaranteed to fall short
But you'll never hear about me cheating 'cause I never would betray your trust no matter what
I will look to you and only you for love
I treat your soul like it was mine
What a privilege to me to be breathe you're air
Doesn't that say that I care

All my soul always say never go

But unfortunately all I have to give to you is an imperfect heart,

[Incomprehensible]
Yeah, we're supposed to be

What if I didn't wake up around 9?
And what if I didn't make it to work on time?

Then I wouldn't have found out what's going on tonight

What if you didn't catch a man on 3?
You'd probably be here with them instead of me
So let's take advantage of what is right in front of us

Mario Winans,"I know you used to care for me
I could tell by the look in your eyes
I thought you will be there for me
Until the day I die

Suddenly I looked around
And you were nowhere to be found
You never even said goodbye
And now I'm searching for an answer girl

I don't know why it hurts so bad
I can't understand why you left me so sad
I don't know the reason why I can't understand
What I feel inside

Don't know why it hurts so bad
I can't understand why you left me so sad
Don't know the reason why I can't understand
What I feel inside, don't know

Confused and brokenhearted
That's what I feel when I think about you
I thought we'd never be apart
Somebody tell me how can this be true?

Now I'm all emotional
And it's getting hard to control
If this is love, I don't need it
'Cause it cuts too deep, baby

I don't know why it hurts so bad
I can't understand why you left me so sad
I don't know the reason why I can't understand
What I feel inside

Don't know why it hurts so bad
I can't understand why you left me so sad
Don't know the reason why I can't understand
What I feel inside, don't know

Everyday I look over my shoulder wishin' you were there
You promised never to leave me, you said, you'll always care

And now I find myself all alone with
No where to turn, tell me, what must I do?

Don't know
I didn't deserve this, baby
Can't understand
Don't know why you left me so sad

Don't know
Feel like I'm going crazy

Mario Winans,"You should of told me how you felt
The day we met
I probly would of loved you anyway
Oohhhhhhhh yeaaaaaa
But instead you led me on to believe that you
Were ready for my love
Ohhhhh babyyyyy
Now its gone aw-ay
Tell me whyyy?
Did you
Say that you were ready for love
When you knew that
Hardly ever think of my heart again
Tell me whyyy?
Ohhh why didn't you baby
Say that you were ready for my love
When you don't even know
What a real love is made of
Tell me babeeeee

You hurt me so badly",Ready for Love (Interlude)
Mario Winans,"You know
Oh baby
You know
You know the time I was lovin'
Girl out of time, girl out of time
Girl out of time, girl out of time
I was lovin' you baby

Every little thing you said
didn't come from your heart
Now I'm laying out in my bed
Wondering what we are
Cause you never meant what you said
And you throw it all on my head
You made me believe, that you wanted me
You could've told the truth instead, baby

I don't know why 
Didn't realize
You took the time to pick me up
And let me down baby
Look in my eyes, you can't deny
That your the reason for the pain I feel inside

[Chorus]
When I looked into your eyes
There was nothing I can see
Now I'm lost and can't find my way
Cause love has blinded me and Now 
I don't know what to do, nothing that have to prove
You played me for a fool, all the time I was lovin' you

Now the things were going
I knew I should've left back then
But my heart was steadily growing
Blaming, all the man I am
If you felt this way 
You should've showed it
You shouldn't ever took so long
Made it cleared, that you don't care
Where did I go wrong, baby?

I don't know why 
Didn't realize
You took the time to pick me up
And let me down baby
Look in my eyes, you can't deny
That your the reason for the pain I feel inside

[Chorus]

You said you loved me
But I'm lonely a'gain
It's gonna take time for me
Yes, you did, Yes you did
You could've told me
That you don't love me anymore
Somebody tell me why, baby

[Chorus]

Can't act like you didn't know
Didn't owe it all that time
But I can't blame you 
I should've known
When I looked into your eyes
Girl, so many nights of sittin' alone
I just sit and wonder why
Baby, what you did was dead wrong
Didn't have to lie

[Chorus]",You Knew
Mario Winans,"Time, is taken a tour on my life
These days keep on passing me by
I want to see you but there's is no time
So I sit here and stare at the sky
And I'm hopin' that you realize I Want to feel you
But there's no time.

[Chorus]
Yesterday you said that we can get away
The day before I was gone like any other day
3 days ago I wrote this song just for you
Will I ever get ahead through to you

Time, just won't see me I do I
I'm still waiting for you to reply
I need to hear you but there's no time
So else keep this line 
I can't deny I miss you 
Can we spend more time

[Chorus]

I've waited so long
To wait for you 
And spend all my food
Will I ever get through?
What can I do
To get this to  
My love is for you 
My love is for me

I just can't waste any more time
So tell me what's with you and I
I waited for you so give me time

Maybe I should ask her

I already know
That you do baby
I already know
It's all threw baby
When you walked threw the door
It was late when you did it

We had some words the other day
I didn't mean to act that way
When I see you now
You won't look in my face
You just turn away

[Hook]
You think you got me figured all out
But look what you make me out to be
You think you got a nigga sold out
But don't really know the half of me
And I say things that I don't mean

[Chorus]
I know it feels so bad
To hear them words I said (that ain't me)
That ain't me, can't you see
I'm not like that at all
Only one side you saw
Understand, you can't judge me by that

Now I'm thinking back on a time
When everything with us was fine
I still know you name
But you forgot mine
And I can't let it go

You think you got me figured all out
But look what you make me out to be
You think you got a nigga sold out
But don't really know the half of me
And I say things that I don't mean

[Chorus]

Don't decide that you know me completely
Even though I hurt your feelings deeply
Don't judge me

[Chorus]

Think about how we used to be
Why did our friendship have to end there
So quick to pass judgment on me
Tell me why can't I make you see that
I say things that I don't mean

[Chorus]",Can't Judge Me
Mario Winans,"First time we met, didn't think you wanted me.
Now, when I'm around you hardly ever speak.
But I really shouldn't judge by the way you treated me
'cause you were waitin' for the perfect time to set me free
I see, but I don't believe

[Chorus: x2]
Seems unreal to me almost like a dream 
Now your lovin' me got me in disbelief
After all this time you made up your mind 
Now your wonderin' why you got me in disbelief 

Kept it all inside had it tucked away for that day
Didn't realize why you couldn't ever say
That you really really really love me
And I'm your man now your tellin' me that we are meant to be
Now I don't understand

[Chorus]

Should've left it alone after waitin' so long 
What are you doin' to me baby? 
I don't want to receive what your tellin' to me
Not after how I have waited 

Should've left it alone after waitin' so long 
What are you doin' to me baby? 
I don't want to receive what your tellin' to me
Not after how I have waited

Hey yo
Hey baby
Where you at man?
Huh? I'm on my way home
It's four thirty in the mornin'
I know, I had to drop my girls off
Alright, be careful
Bye

Yeah girl, that was him
I tell him the same thing I always tell him
And it worked again

Is about a young man
Who's endured a lot of twists and turns in his life
Cause he always kept his head up, stayed focused
This man's name is Mario Winans, listen

[Chorus]
What makes you think I can't make it?
Put me to the test, I'll take it
I've been through more trials
But I've overcome all of them
And I've never been one for faking
I kept on moving and shaking
And that's how I made it

I've seen it all
But I never let no one
Tell me it's right, when it's wrong
Cause I heard it all before
And it gives me a reason to fight for
A right for, to do what I gotta do

[Chorus]

All of my life
I was told that you had to go through
Just to get where you want
And if you come across a storm
You just gotta keep holding on, and stay strong
And do what you gotta do

[Chorus]

Hey yo I came from the bottom, worked my way up
Ran wit big dudes, had to get my weight up
Now my cake up, now it's lights, cameras, make up
Trips to Jacob, foreign countries
Reminisce of times when we all was hungry
Now I made it, and all y'all niggaz can hate it
Seeing that I sound like Mase and
Knowing that I came from the basement
Did my own thing, so face it
Now they coming wit cases, now wit this hand I'm racist
I'm so close I can taste it
Sometimes I just wanna grab toast and take it
But I'm a keep moving and shaking

Baby all that I can say
If you're gonna do your thing
Then don't come back to me

I don't wanna know your whereabouts or how you movin
I know when you in the house or when you cruisin

Ever since he met you had that good Oochie Wally
Curves so killer, you put insurance on your body
Remember that jude joints? your hair all knotty
And I was coming through in that blue Maserati go
See this honey was potent like cook blow
Crack! I mixed the Black with Phillipino
Used to live in Reno but we met on the beach
Sang bars from the star, everythang was peace
Then we got our shit together, you moved in the castle
Let you shop wit the Capital One, no hassles
One minute you're cool, next minute you're amped
Talking loud trying to play me like a wet food stamp
Ho!! Think of me in your life with the next dude
I'm like Chef, I'm contemplating my next move
Then think of all the wankstas I hit
Ain't this a bitch? shit this is all the thanks I get?
I'm gone

How could you do it to a nigga like this?
Tell me, tell me
And why would you give another nigga my kiss?
You hurt me, hurt me babe
I gave my love, my time, my life
In return you give me pain
What a shame, and this is the thanks I get baby!",This Is the Thanks I Get
Mario Winans,"Everything you said to me
Tell me I was buggin', dreamin'
Cause it's not that real to me
There has been no sleepin'
I've been thinkin'

Of how I beg to love you
Want to leave me
Hurts me deeply inside
How I long to touch you
Need to hold you
Stay with me one more night

[Chorus]
Turn around, take just one more look
See if you're really sure
That you can walk away, from my love
I'm beggin' you to stay
Down on my knees to pray
That you would turn around and be my baby

All the moments that we shared
You could never put a price on us
I tried to trust in you
After all of this how dare
You say that you are leavin'
Have you been thinkin'

Of how I beg to love you
You want leave me

Just want to give in, you're leavin
Don't walk away from my love
Can't go a day without your love

Still all in denial that you've been gone for weeks

[Chorus]
I don't want to go another day bein' without your love.
(no I don't baby)
I've been listenin' to my heart and now its speakin' 'bout love.
(Tell me why baby)
Tell my why you always have to leave and take your love away
(you didn't have to do it baby)
Now I realize you were the best for me just a little too late baby

I shoulda trusted my instinct, what's wrong with me?
Thought I learned all my lessons but I didn't learn a thing
You once said that you couldn't take me where you was headed
I cried inside and now I'm man enough to admit it

Mario Winans,"I just can't believe this man
Just another night of these thoughts
Can't get this outta my head, yeah

Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself

I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
Cuz my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know

Oh baby
I think about it when I hold you
When looking in your eyes, I can't believe
I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself

I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
Cuz my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know

Did he touch you better than me
Did he watch you fall asleep
Did you show him all those things
That you used to do to me
If you're better off that way
Baby all that I can say
If you're gonna do your thing
Then don't come back to me

I don't wanna know your whereabouts or how you movin
I know when you in the house or when you cruisin
Its been proven, my love you abusin
I can't understand how a man got you choosin (yeah)
Undecided I came and provided, my undivided
You came and denied it (why?)
Don't even try it, I know when you lyin (i know when you lyin)
Don't even do that
I know why you cryin (stop cryin)
I'm not applyin no pressure, just wanna let you know
That I don't wanna let you go (i don't wanna let you go)
And I don't wanna let you leave
Can't say I didn't let you breathe
Gave you extra cheese(c'mon) put you in the SUV
You wanted ice so I made you freeze
Made you hot like the west indies (that's right)
Now its time you invest in me
Cause if not then its best you leave
Holla yeah

Mario Winans,"There's times in my life where I just
I just wanna run away, I just
I just wish the pain would stop
I don't wanna cry no more
I wish the pain would go away

Start a day, bad hands make it hard to deal
Sometimes I wanna pull it, end it all with a bullet
Hard to live life to the fullest with all this bullshit
Mad as fuck, a nigga had enough
From jump street, saw my father murder massacre slain
One shot took half of his brain, I recapture the pain
Twenty-three years, three when it happened
Twenty-six now, still I can't stop the tears
Then my mood switch, thinkin' about this sheisty bitch
Kinda funny cause they fake it when they callin' you honey
On your dick when they think a nigga, might be rich
That's when I shit, cause I know you fuck with me for my money
Learned the hard way, ain't no correctin' the grief
Baby moms starts sexin', my so-called beef
Don't give a fuck if they Marked me For Death like Steven
Or relievin' your breathin', long as I'm even 'fore I'm leavin'
Pain

I wish this pain, would go away
We're talkin about the kind of pain that
I wish this pain, would go away
Just gets all up in your heart, and in your soul
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that makes you feel like you can't go on no more
I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone

I can't relate to them cats who hold gats at the gate
Is it my fate, am I that nigga, that they love to hate
Solely, slowly, cause I rock a Roley they want my brain gone
Cause of a fuckin' chain on?
Migraine's on, now the pain's warm, I stagger
And I'm hopin' I don't know the cat with the dagger
Penetratin' my heart, rushed thoughts etched in grief
To the City College deceased may you rest in peace
To the families, I never meant to cause no pain
I know the truth, but if you want, then I shoulder the blame
Overcome at times by uncontrollable flames, and multiple pains
Now it seems like I'm goin insane
For the love of you and hip-hop I expand the news
But before my shit drops, I stand accused
Don't you think I wish we all was rich?
One for all it's pain to see your people when they all can't ball
The pain..

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna give no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna receive no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
God, please take the pain away

I can still hear the shots that left my man Big layin'
On my knees cryin' and prayin', then I said
""God why?  Got to know how hard we try
Don't let him die, please don't let my nigga be dead""
But it was too late, California sealed his fate
Gone now, hard to move on now, fuck making songs now
Wish I could die, I could fly
If they don't give a fuck, fuck it why should I?
That's when Big spoke, pulled up in a glistening three
With platinum wings and said, ""Puff listen to me""
He puts his hands on my head and said ""I live through you
Make hits continuous, this is what we do
I know it might be strenuous and times is hard
Just keep the faith cause now we rhyme with God
Plus you owe it to yourself and don't forget the kids""
That's when I opened up my eyes and new Bad Boy lives

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away

I'm tellin' you man
Now don't let these motherfuckers fuck your shit up God
I don't give a fuck who it is
Don't let em fuck yo' paper man, please Big
Focus your mind man, do your albums, make them hot joints
Man fuck these niggaz man
Fuck these niggaz man
And I'ma tell the same thing to you
When you get your shit done, watch your money, and
Hopefully, I pray for you, you be the shit
And soon motherfuckers start screamin' your name out
Like they screamin' all these other, so-called hot niggas
Never take your eyes off that shit yo
Try to get everything you can out of these motherfuckers yo
Ain't no guarantee they gonna love you next year

I wish this pain, would go away
I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain
I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain",The Pain

Curling up to a ball
In a state and accepted

She's running from men, running
I didn't want to get in a fight
But it's already on your roster tonight
I'm clinging on to your clothes
And to feel your leather and to smell your leather
The feeling of power is yours not mine
I've seen this happen a million times
Why don't you stop when you see me cry
Can you carry on with tears in my eyes
Left behind
On the floor
And I really want to stay here
From the sight that I just saw
I didn't really see you at all
Because the girl in front of me was myself when I was small
And now she's running from men, run, run
I didn't want to get in a fight
But it's already on your roster tonight
I'm clinging on to your clothes
have to feel your leather and to smell your leather
The feeling of power is yours not mine

And all your hands just cheer
When I'm as white as a sheet with fear

Why the gift of our eyes
What am I feeling and who am I missing

Marion,"Stop so what have you done?
Stuck at the same point
All you do is sulk

Stop, what is it you see?
It's probably nothing
In common with me

I'm not, not being fair
To pull up and bring down
On every trend

But you've not, you've not been there
All the time I've called out
I've looked everywhere

When you're coming back
When you're coming back
When you're coming back for more
If you're coming back
When you're coming back, wake me up

When you're coming back
When you're coming back
When you're coming back
When you're coming back

Start, do it and more
You've folded enough times
You're here to walk off

Start, move, your luck's in
I can here it, I'm seeing one thing

I'm not and I've not been fair
To grind down and find out
All that you were

But you've not, you've not been there
All the times I've called out
I'm looking elsewhere

If you're coming back
When you're coming back
When you're coming back for more
When you're coming back
If you're coming back, wake me up

When you're coming back
When you're coming back
When you're coming back
When you're coming back
'cause I can't remember you here

Well, I tried to get inside her
As she gazed up at the sun
Said she knows of an alternative way

With our miles stretched out behind her
Now she's looking at me
Then she blew all my ideas away

She said, ""Stop, you're thinking too much
And not doing enough, your head is too full
Your making me uneasy
'cause I have to think stirring it up""

When you're coming back
When you're coming back
When you're coming back for more
When you're coming back
If you're coming back, wake me up

When you're coming back
When you're coming back
When you're coming back
When you're coming back
'cause I can't remember you here

Were you ever here?
Were you ever here?
Were you ever here at all?
Were you ever here?
Were you ever here? Maybe never

Were you ever here?
Were you ever here?
Were you ever here?
Were you ever here, here?

Do I look as though I still need you?
There's a time

Happen to everybody

All I needed
I'd be doing fine

I look at your face
I can see I'm not the flavor today
I will try and keep with your pace
But I'm scared the only one left
Will be me

I will always find a way

Marion,"Comes with the feeling of being left
Is the feeling of hate
And the sickening sense you can't make it
By yourself

Losers haven is the place I'm staying
Could be lovers but I would be paying
All our feelings should fall into place
How they don't

Even though I, even though I know
Even though I
Know everything I need to know about you
You still hideaway

I watch the birds as they fly away
And you do too
I watch you searching for gain for yourself
Minds are cruel

Losers', heaven will be coming up soon
Turns it's ugly head and looks at you
There's some things that you just have to see
Follow me

Even though I, even though I know
Even though I
Know everything there is to know about you
You still hideaway

You still hideaway
You still hideaway
I know everything there is to know about you
You still hideaway

Now we all are calling
But your way past listening
And your heart is freezing us all

Even though I, even though I know
Even though I
Know everything I need to know about you
You still hideaway

You still hideaway
You still hideaway
Know everything I need to know about you
You still hideaway

Marion Raven,"5 AM on a Sunday morning
Walking uptown
With the rain in the snow
When I saw you
It came without a warning
A face I had never seen
A feeling I had never known

Moving slow in the early morning
Making love in the quiet of the day
The world was waiting to take us to a new place
We knew that we were changing
We knew that we would never be the same

I know
I would do it all over again
At the end of the day
When we are alone
I get that feeling when I see your face
And I know
You'll be there at the end of the day

Two years later we are living together
We built our dream house on a hill by the sea
We could see the shadows that were growing in the distance
We were hiding
We were blind to what we did not want to see

I know
I would do it all over again
At the end of the day
When we are alone
I get that feeling when I see your face
And I know
We will be together

5 years gone by, we have turned into strangers
We never talk since you went away
Now I find myself walking in circles
I keep looking for you everywhere
Keep waiting for the end of the day

I know
I would do it all again
At the end of the day
When I'm all alone
I get a feeling that I can't explain
If I knew then what I know now
Wouldn't change a thing, if I could somehow
I would do it all over
Over and over again
I hope and I pray
We can do it all over again
I know
We will be together someday
At the end of the day
We will be together
At the end of the day
We will be together someday
At the end of the day
We will be together",At the End of the Day

The salt of my skin reminds me
The touch of your lips
And I know that you and I will always be

Won't you meet me where?

Won't you meet me here?

Won't you meet me where?

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Who have my dreams come true

Not like it's hurt me before

For once I have someone I know won't desert me

As long as I know I have love I can make it

And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty
Mariona Font,"Volver a los diecisiete
Despu√©s de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan fr√°gil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un ni√±o frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay s√≠ s√≠ s√≠

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el m√°s claro proceder
Ni el m√°s ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve ni√±o
Y al malo solo el cari√±o
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abri√≥ como por encanto
Entr√≥ el amor con su manto
Como una tibia ma√±ana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazm√≠n
Volando cual seraf√≠n
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis a√±os en diecisiete
Los convirti√≥ el querub√≠n",Volver a Los 17

Marisa Monte,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Chocolate/√â Probido Fumar [DVD]

Desde muito cedo e que s√≥ viram

No alvorecer que foi surgindo

Meanwhile night falls into regions
And if we could just see faster we could watch everything
Dawn is next to night and getting darker
And all the afternoons are falling, falling

In the dawn that was the rising

Tinha suspirado,    tinha beijado o papel devotamente!

Era a primeira vez que lhe escreviam aquelas sentimentalidades,

E o seu orgulho dilatava-se ao calor amoroso que sa√≠¬≠a delas,

Como um corpo ressequido que se estira num banho t√©pido;
Sent√≠a um acr√©scimo de estima por si mesma,

E parecia-lhe que entrava enfim numa exist√™ncia superiormente interessante,

Onde cada hora tinha o seu encanto diferente,
Cada passo conduzia a um √™xtase,

E a alma se cobria de um luxo radioso de sensa√ß√µes!""

It was many and many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabelle Lee
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me

I was a child and she was a child
In this kingdom by the sea
But we loved with a love that was more than love
I and my Annabelle Lee
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me
And this was the reason that, long ago
In this kingdom by the sea
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabelle Lee
So that her highborn kinsman came
And bore her away from me
To shut her up in a sepulcher
In this kingdom by the sea

It was many and many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabelle Lee

Hay tantos muertos

Grievous angels laugh at you 
For leaving me to be
