David Bowie,"Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light 
Which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears 
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love
Which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing is gonna
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing is gonna
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change 
Nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna change 
Nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna change 
Nothing's gonna change

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change 
Nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna change, no, no, no
Nothing's gonna change my world",Across the Universe [DVD]
David Bowie,"Once we were lovers, can they understand?
Closer than others I was your, I was your man
Don't talk of heartaches, (ohh), I remember them all
When I'm checking you out one day, to see if I'm
Faking it all

Can you hear me?
Can you feel me inside?
Show your love, love
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right ahh)

There's been many others (oo-oo-oo-oohh) so many times
Sixty new cities, an' what do I
What do I find?

I want love so badly, I want you most of all
You know, it's harder to take it from anyone
It's harder to fall
Can you hear me call ya?

Can you (hear me?)

David Bowie,"He's everybody's token, on everybody's wall
Blessing all the papers, thanking one and all
Hugging all the babies, kissing all the ladies
Knowing all that you think about from writing on the wall

He's so divine, his soul shines
Breaks the night, sleep tight
His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race
He says ""I'm somebody""
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart

He says ""Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me""
He's the savage son of the TV tube
Planets wrote the day was due

All the wisest men around
Predicted that a man was found
Who looked a lot like you and me, yeah
Everyone with sense could see
Nothing left his eye unmoved, he

Had the plan, he had to use
He's so divine, his soul shines
Breaks the night, sleep tight
His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race

He says ""I'm somebody""
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart

He says ""Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me""
Somebody plays my song in tune
Makes me, makes me, makes me stronger for you, babe
Was a way when we were young, that
Any man was judged by what he'd done
But now you pick them on the screen (what they look like)
Where they've been

[Chorus 2]
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart

He says ""Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me""
Leaders come, they hate all the people know
That given time, the leaders go
Tell me, can they hold you under their spell
Can they walk and hold you as well as a
Smile like Valentino?
Could he sell you anything?
Keep your eyes on your soul, keep your hand on your heart

He says ""Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me""
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody
Yeah, can't remember (somebody) peace so well

David Bowie,"Someday they won't let you, now you must agree
The times they are a-telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on tv
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984

They'll split your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell that you're eighty, but brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's never there
Beware the savage jaw

David Bowie,"The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
Here are we, one magical moment, such is the stuff

From where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean, lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no color

Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement from Kether to Malkuth
There are you, you drive like a demon from station to station

The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, making sure white stays

Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down

Got to keep searching and searching
Oh, what will I be believing and who will connect me with love?
Wonderful, wonderful, wonder when

Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high

It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful

It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here

I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful

It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here

Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late to be grateful

It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here, yes it's here

It's too late
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late, it's too late
The European cannon is here

It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful

It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here

I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful

It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here

Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late to be grateful

It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful

David Bowie,"This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

Stay, that's what I meant to say or do something
But I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so badly this time
'Cause you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want too

Heartwrecker, heartwrecker, make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

Stay, that's what I meant to say or do something

You walked into my life

David Bowie,"Sometimes I feel
The need to move on
So I pack a bag
And move on
Move on

Well I might take a train
Or sail at dawn
Might take a girl
When I move on
When I move on

Somewhere, someone's calling me
And when the chips are down
I'm just a travelling man
Maybe it's just a trick of the mind, but
Somewhere there's a morning sky
Bluer than her eyes
Somewhere there's an ocean
Innocent and wild

Africa is sleepy people
Russia has its horsemen
Spent some nights in old Kyoto
Sleeping on the matted ground

Cyprus is my island
When the going's rough
I would love to find you
Somewhere in a place like that

Somewhere, someone's calling me
And when the chips are down
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you

Feeling like a shadow
Drifting like a leaf
I stumble like a blind man

David Bowie,"Did you ever have a dream or two
Where the hero is a guy named you
And the things he does are just too much
Does he fly like Mr. Superman, speak Chinese, French and Dutch?
And did you ever have a dream or two?

Have you ever woken up one day
With the feeling that you'd been away?
If the girl that you dreamed of last night
Had the same dream, in the very same scene
With the very same boy, hold tight

It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can travel anywhere with anyone you care
It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can walk around in New York while you sleep in Penge

I will travel round the world one night
On the magic wings of astral flight
If you've got the secret, tell me do
Have you ever had a dream or two?
Have you ever had a dream or two?

It used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz
Til the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot

And in this little yard, there's a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home

""Ah-choo, excuse me""

Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair
And you put it in your pocket

""God, it's pouring down""

Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket

Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only 10, full of life and oh so gay
And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish, Oh God

No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself

Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love give love give love give love
Give love give love give love give love give love
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the (People on streets) edge of the night
And loves (People on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is ourselves

David Bowie,"The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
Here are we, one magical moment, such is the stuff

From where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean, lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no color

Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement from Kether to Malkuth
There are you, you drive like a demon from station to station

The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, making sure white stays

Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down

Got to keep searching and searching
Oh, what will I be believing and who will connect me with love?
Wonder who, wonder who, wonder when

Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high

It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful

It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful

I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful

It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here

Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?

The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had

I'm stiff on my legend,
The films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty
'Cause you just got paid

Show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck,
Give me your head
Before you start professing
That you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay, please stay, please stay
You caught yourself a trick down
On Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you baby
You're a porcupine

You sold me illusions for a sack full of checks
You've made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex

Show me you're real

A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow

David Bowie,"In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping 
By a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked, why not, and I replied, I don't know
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped Kahlil Gibran
And I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

Ho
Oh I said so long and I waved bye-bye
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said you'll never go down to the Gods again
(Turn around, go back)

He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back)

His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back)

Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply

David Bowie,"Wake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

What are we coming to
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned
What we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh you Pretty Things

Mamas and Papas insane
Oh you Pretty Things

Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself they belong to you
They're the start of a coming race
The earth is a bitch
We've finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use

She was tired you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes
They were blue but nobody home

Well, she could've been a killer
If she didn't walk the way she do and she do
She opened strange doors
That we'd never close again

She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean?

Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

She asked me to stay
And I stole her room
She asked for my love
And I gave her a dangerous mind

Now she's stupid in the street
And she can't socialize
Well, I love the little girl
And I'll love her till the day she dies

She wails

At coconut fur that hides behind coloured shades that blind your eyes

Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in the tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor he's clogged and clothed in saffron robes
His beads are all he owns

Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said that slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

Fairy tale skin, depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war a gentle face you've seen before
Karma man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin

Slow down, slow down

Because the years of fretting days are right behind you now
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds
I will show you a game where the winner never wins

Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free
I will boldly light that lamp and we shall walk together

Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you
I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'll like to hear

Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

Let me sleep beside you

David Bowie,"War made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier

Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade
Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier

Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless, lonely days

Then one day, in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longingly
At the ice-cream in the hand of
The little bombardier

Sunshine entered our Frankie's days
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy

Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coin he made

Then two gentlemen called on him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game?

Leave them alone or we'll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said no more
To the little bombardier

Packed his bags, his heart in pain
Wiped a tear and caught a train
Not to be seen in the town again

David Bowie,"Bow Bells strike another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
You can't make a thing cause the meter's dead
You moved away
Told your folks you're gonna stay away

Bright lights, Soho, Wardour street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you

Oh, the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose faith
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys, with the London boys

You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
You take the pills too much
You don't give a damn about that jobs you've got
So long as you're with the London boys

A London boy, oh a London boy
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
A London boy, a London boy
You think you've had a lot of fun
But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run
It's too late now, cause you're out there boy
You've got it made with the rest of the toys
Now you wish you'd never left your home
You've got what you wanted but you're on your own

There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand

Rubber Band
In 1910 I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes

Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune, oh
Rubber Band 
Won't you play a haunting theme again to me
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon

Oh, play that theme

How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in lively parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love

Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets

David Bowie,"She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back
And never took her out
She wore a trenchcoat khaki
Her hobnail boots were full of holes
She's got medals

Her mother called her Mary, but she changed her name to Tommy, she's a one, oh
She went and joined the army, passed the medical
Don't ask me how it's done
They sent her to the front line
Fighting for her country's name
She's got medals

She got very tired of picking up girls
Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls
Then the enemy dropped a bomb
Survivors there were none

People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed
You can see her ghost but that's a lie because the naughty woman isn't dead

Replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green
Called herself Eileen

David Bowie,"Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop 
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up 
Climbs across his bike and he's away 
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street 
Back to mother, it's another empty day 

Uncle Arthur likes his mommy 
Uncle Arthur still reads comics 
Uncle Arthur follows Batman 

Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum 
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum 
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed 
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion 
Sally was the real thing, not just lust 

Uncle Arthur vanished quickly 
Uncle Arthur and his new bride 
Uncle Arthur follows Sally 

Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days 
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze 
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled 
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop 
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed

I will chew and spit tabacco like my grandfather jones
'cause I'm only four and five is far away

When I'm five
I will read the magazines in mummy's drawer
When I'm five
I will walk behind the soldiers in the may day parade
'cause I'm only four and grown-ups walk too fast

Yesterday was horrid day, 'cause raymond kicked my shin
And mummy says if I am good, she'll let me go to school in August
Daddy shouted loud at mummy and I dropped my toast at breakfast
And I laughed when bonzo licked my face, because it tickled
I wonder why my daddy cries and how I wish that I was nearly five

When I'm five
I will catch a butterfly and eat it and I won't be sick
When I'm five
I will jump in puddles, laugh in church and marry my mum
And I'll let my daddy do the washing-up

If I close one eye, the people on that side can't see me
I get headaches in the morning and I rode on freddie's tricycle
And everywhere was funny, when I ran down to the sweetshop
Then I fell and bleeded-up my knee and everybody soppied me

I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look through your things
I'd like to beat on your drum

I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear

David Bowie,"Up until one century ago there lived,
In the Zi Duang provence of eastern country
A glass-like spider.
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web,
In weeks creating a macabre

Shrine of remains
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers,
Like floors in a building

At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with almost apparent
Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops.
One could almost call it an altar.
When the breeze blew through this construction,
It produced sounds of wailing, crying.
Tiny wails, tiny cries.

The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically
For their mother.
But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies
Would survive someone on their own.
Oh-The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like-a human's.
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries.

Don't you hear this wasted cry, Life is over you
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell
(Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now)
Take care, take care.
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone.
But you, you've promise in your lovin' eye. God it's dark now.

Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Gone, Gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Stay low on the ground, fire can drive you, savage and afraid
Spitting the dawn, come come come along before the animals awake
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left.
If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might
Gone, gone, the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone

Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Gone gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone",Glass Spider
David Bowie,"Do you see that thing
I'm sure it's love
Would you do one thing
New York's in love
The city grew wings in the back of the night
The clouds are stuck like candy-floss
She sees the rich trash having all the fun
Makes her wonder where they get the energy from
There's nothing you can do to her
This city's all clean and waiting
I don't mean to wait too long
But this joint can't get much higher

With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New York's in flames

With the way she talks
And the way she walks

My, oh my, it's a tom-tom beat
No-one knows they've had their day
We can dance and we can see the singles swing
Everybody's waiting for the Go-Go Boys.
You're turned to stone by the family
It's now the dead speak to the living
Nothing left here but a raging blaze
I don't mean to wait too long

Spending two weeks
In a crack house
Burns on his brain 
Like Chernobyl

Dean was seen 
With a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mother's bed

Till I met you

Memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune-
I can make you happy
Every day of your life
Making my love 
Like a shining star
Takin' my love just a touch too far

Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice 
Cause love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
I've got windows, I've seen much vice, 
I've touched down with vermin,
Cowardice, lice,
And I say

Nobody cares what you do-
Please be yourself to death

I could be your great misfortune
But you'll never find a, bet you'll never find a better man.

And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs 
Threw it all away

I would not challenge a giant

He just flew 'til he burst

Time will crawl 'til our feet grow small
Time will crawl 'til our tails fall off

Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear

Time will crawl, time will crawl
Time will crawl
'Til the 21st century lose

You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask came off
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep

Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red

David Bowie,"There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes

But you're just pushin', pushin', pushin' for a fight

You look trapped, turn the radio on
Too much smoke, air conditioning gone
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking, looking, looking for a break

Is it love or is it what?
Who's this guy I'm gonna blow away, hey
What kind of love is he giving you?

And the fabulous sons have crashed their planes in flames
Now tomorrow is back claiming redemption is on your heels
And a toothless past is asking you how it feels

And me, my little red corvette has driven by
Fair weather heart has fallen in
My rainyday girl is feeling down
And she tells me that the world is spinning round

I say the dream was all for you
You're nobody else
Tonight the zeroes were singing for you
Yeah

Hi! Can I walk you home again today?
Gotta get forgive and forget hey hey
Something good is happening and I don't know what it is
Don't you know we're back on trial again today

And it's breaking wine for you
Hell!, it's only 'cause you're true

Stopping and preaching and letting love in

David Bowie,"In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old Willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries
In a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And he'll show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon

And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
""Hey, bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch
But he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow
Underneath the street lamp

In the port of Amsterdam
There's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies
To a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
When he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky
Aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love

In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam",Amsterdam

He'll build a better whirlpool

Baby can drown

Baby can touch her toes
Toss her hair

Baby can walk around the town
Attract a man and cut him down

The man who can and don't look back

Pull the blinds and change their minds

Can never bend

Bending sound, dredging the ocean, lost in my circle

Tall in this room overlooking the ocean

Here are we, one magical movement from kether to malkuth
There are you, drive like a demon from station to station

Found him slumped across the table. A gun and me alone

David Bowie,"Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope
Into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one

Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh ""It's the madness in his eyes""
As he breaks the night to cry:

""It's really me
Really you
And really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you
And really me
You'll lose me though I'm always
Really free""

And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the wild eyed boy
From Freecloud

And the village Dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the wild eyed boy
From Freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand

And the magic in the stare
Of the wild eyed boy said
""Stop, Freecloud
They won't think to cut me down""
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the wise boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain",Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud [Rare B Side Version]
David Bowie,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

David Bowie,"And so the story goes they wore the clothes
They said the things to make it seem improbable
Whale of a lie like they hope it was

And the good men tomorrow had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of brawn were nicer shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss
Sighings swirl through the streets like the crust of the sun, the Bewlay Brothers

In our wings that bark
Flashing teeth of brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh, and we were gone
Hanging out with your dwarf men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions

I was stone and he was wax so he could scream and still relax
Unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Through our veins and though it was midnight back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the cathedral floor
The solid book we wrote cannot be found today
And it was stalking time for the moon boys, the Bewlay Brothers

With our backs on the arch
And if the Devil may be here
But he can't sing about that
Oh, and we were gone
Real cool traders
We were so turned on
You thought we were fakers

And now the dress is hung, the ticket pawned
The factor max that proved the fact is melted down
Woven on the edging of my pillow
And my brother lays upon the rocks
He could be dead, he could be not, he could be you
He's chameleon, comedian, Corinthian and caricature
Shooting up pie in the sky
Bewlay brothers
In the feeble, in the bad
Bewlay brothers

In the blessed and cold
In the crutch-hungry dark
Was where we flayed our mark
Oh, and we were gone
Kings of Oblivion
We were so turned on
In the night walk pavilion

Lay me place and bake me pie I'm starving for me gravy
Leave my shoes, and door unlocked I might just slip away

Just for the day, ay
Please come away, ay
Just for the day, ay
Please come away, ay
Please come away, ay

Please come away, ay

I tell you baby, don't want no home
I wander round, feet off the ground
I even go from town to town
I said I think this rock is grand
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

I met this chick, the other day
And then to me, she said she'll stay
I get this pad, just like a cave
And then we'll have, our living made
And then I'll lead her on the ground
My head is spinning round
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

I, I, I, I, I need a lover 'cause someone new
And then to her I will be true
I'll buy her furs and pretty things

(Dom do ah) I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone

And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw

His name was always buddy (got got do ah aah aah)
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like twig the wonder kid (got got do ah)
And turn her face away

She's uncertain if she likes him (got got do ah aah aah)
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers (got got do ah)

It's hard enough to keep formation with this fall out saturation

(Bah dom bah) cursing at the astronette

He's crashing out with Sylvian
The bureau supply for aging men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Once had raised a sea that raged no more

David Bowie,"I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra
I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a supernova
I could walk like Brando right into the sun
Then dance just like a Casanova
With my blackjack and jacket and hair slicked sweet
Silver star studs on my duds like a Harley in heat
When I strut down the street I could hear its heartbeat
The sisters fell back and said ""Don't that man look pretty""
The cripple on the corner cried out ""Nickels for your pity""
Them gasoline boys downtown sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the city

I was the king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash
I was the prince of the paupers crowned downtown at the beggar's bash
I was the pimp's main prophet I kept everything cool
Just a backstreet gambler with the luck to lose
And when the heat came down it was left on the ground
The devil appeared like Jesus through the steam in the street
Showin' me a hand I knew even the cops couldn't beat
I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat
It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a boy out on the street

And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead
As the tracks clack out the rhythm their eyes fixed straight ahead
They ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread
But it's too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat
You get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your seat
Your heart starts beatin' faster as you struggle to your feet
Then you're outta that hole and back up on the street

And them South Side sisters sure look pretty
The cripple on the corner cries out ""Nickels for your pity""
And them downtown boys sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the city",It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City [#]
David Bowie,"Well I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries ""It's all in vain""
The voice of doom was shining in my room
I just need one day somewhere far away
Lord, I just need one day

Well, I've been breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes, I'll be breaking these rocks
It was my price to pay

Oh, the river's so muddy, but it may come clear
And I know too well what's keeping me here
I'm just the slave of a burning ray
Oh, give me the night, I can't take another sight
Please, please give me the night

Been breaking this rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes, I'll be breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay?

Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high
Up in the tower they're watching me, hoping I'm gonna die

I won't be breaking no rocks

David Bowie,"He looked a lot like Che Guevara, drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion, such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
And I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights

Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table a gun and me alone
I ran to the window looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit he'd left me an autograph
Let me collect dust I wish someone would phone

David Bowie,"Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly,
And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

Now Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
'Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders, while the fly tried to break our balls
With just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kid was just crass, he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar

Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.

David Bowie,"I stood stone-like at midnight suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and came out with my soul untouched
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said ""Sit down"" I stood up.
Ooh-ooh growin' up

The flag of piracy flew from my mast, my sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate, she couldn't sail but she sure could sing,
I pushed be	-52 and bombed 'em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school, never once gave thought to landing,
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said ""Come down"" I threw up
Ooh-ooh growin' up

I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere and you know it's really hard to hold your breath.
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared, I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well, my feet they finally took root in the earth but I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car

I'm lookin' through African eyes
Lit by the glare of an L.A. fire
I've got a face, not just my race, Bang Bang I've got you babe

Sun comes up and the man goes down 
And the woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear
Then we jump through hoops, we're divisable now, just disappear

We reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Then die in the flames singing ""we shall overcome""
Whoa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it 
But we'll come through don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I look into your eyes
And I wonder sometimes

Oh Lord, just let him see me 
Lord, Lord just let him hear me
Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together.

Reach over race and hold each other's hands
Walk through the night thinking we are the world
Woa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it 
But we'll come through don't doubt it

I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me

Yes, and I wonder why sometimes

But never how to make the rules

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Did the world just explode?
Don't recognize anyone
But you've still got me under your thumb
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

In this sexual noise, vicious chords offer joy

But you can't buy me off in this serial world
Who who who died and made you material girl?
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern song
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

With only one promise, only one way to fall

David Bowie,"This ain't rock'n'roll, this is genocide

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Todd Browning's freak you was

Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The diamond dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal

(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzie, go man go

Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralyzed, Diamond Dogs are stabilized

(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs

In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow

(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone

To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling no
And her daddy has told her to go

But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man look at those cavemen go

Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy

Trapped in a high-dollar joint in some place I called her name

She was shakin' like this honey doing that

When I was falling to pieces I screamed in pain

Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me

All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

What are we coming to
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned
What we were here for

The only thing I ever got from you
Was sorrow, sorrow

You're acting funny, try to spend my money
You out there playing your high class games
Of sorrow, sorrow

You never do what you know you ought to
Something tells me you're the devil's daughter
Sorrow, sorrow

I tried to find her cause I can't resist her
I never knew just how much I missed her

With your long blond hair, I couldn't sleep last night

He lays her down, he frowns
Gee my life's a funny thing, am I still too young?

It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

All night
She wants the young American
Young American, young American, she wants the young American
All right
She wants the young American

Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
Misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries where have all Papa's heroes gone?

All night
She wants a young American
Young American, young American, she wants the young American
All right

Do you remember, the bills you have to pay
For even yesterday?

Have you have been an un-American?
Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the afro-Sheilas
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her heart's been broken just like you have

A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his Soul Train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man you can say no more?
And, ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me
Break down and cry?

Back away from the light
It's all deranged - no control
Sit tight in your corner
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control
If I could control tomorrow's haze
The darkened shore wouldn't bother me
If I can't control the web we weave
My life will be lost in the fallen leaves
Every single move's uncertain
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control
I should live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
You've gotta have a scheme
You've gotta have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man
No control
Stay away from the future
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control
Forbidden words, deafen me
In memory, no control
See how far a sinful man
Burns his tracks, his bloody robes
You've gotta have a scheme
You've gotta have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man

David Bowie,"My name is Mr. Touchshriek
Of Touchshriek, mail over and fantasy
My shop sells egg shells off the shesores
And empty females

I'm thinking of leasing the room above my shop
To a Mr. Walloff Domburg
A reject from the world wide Internet
He's a broken man, I'm also a broken man

It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations
Lookin' through windows for demons
Watchin' the young advance in all electric

Some of the houses 'round here still have inhabitants in them
I'm not sure if they're from this country or not
I don't get to speak much to anyone or that sort of thing
If I had another broken name, oh, I dream of something like that

David Bowie,"Test, testing, testing
This, hmm, Grace is my name and, and I was, hm
It was that phot, a fading photograph of
A patch, a patchwork quilt

And they've put me on these
Ramona put me on these interest drugs
So I'm thinking very, too, bit too fast like a brain hatch
And, ah, they won't let me see anybody
If I want to sometimes and I ask

I can still hear some pop, popular musics and aftershocks
I've been watching a television of, um, in the homelands
That's the new homelands and, um, and that's all I can remember
And now they just want me to be quiet
And I think something is going to be horrid

Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and rocks and the sand

Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames

From deep behind fifty year old eyes
Get real, get real

I'm scared to touch, too tense to be undone
I walk the streets not expecting morning sun
Against the voice of doom failures fall all over town
I guess I should, I feel I should, get real, get real

What's up? What happened when I wasn't around?
Who did what? What went down?
Get real, get real

Think about myself it happens to me
It happens in the tunnel when I let myself feel
Get real, get real

I'm scared to touch, too tense to be undone
I walk the streets not expecting morning sun
I feel it all through breakdowns falling all over town

""Good God, oh my"", I cry
And die, and lie beside

She is the apple in my eye
She talked to God
I couldn't cope or'd hope eloped
A dope she roped this salty lie

And when she's dreaming, I believe
And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her telling me she's dead again
Telling me she's dead against it

And deep my wound
Within for every second chance it was thy tore
From deep within despite the rain
My words are worn

She loves to talk into the phone
No matter who, no matter when
No matter where
No better than the faulty line

And when she's dreaming, I believe
And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her telling me she's dead again
Telling me she's dead against it
",Dead Against It
David Bowie,"Though the idea of confession, it is said to be
The union of and his bride, the Christian
It's all very puzzling

Sex and the church, sex and the church
Sex and the church and the church and the church

All the great mystic religions put strong emphasis
On the redeeming spiritual qualities of sex, of sex
Christianity has been pretty modern about sex

Of sex, of sex, of sex, of sex
Sex and the church, sex and the church
Sex and the church, sex, sex

I think there is a union between the flesh and the spirit
Sex and the church, sex and the church
All religions' mother

Give me the freedom of spirit and the joys
Of the flesh and sex, sex, sex and the church
Give me the freedom of spirit and the joys
Of the flesh and sex, sex, sex and the church

Sex and the church, sex and the church
Sex and the church and the church and the church
Sex, sex, sex and the church, sex and the church
Sex and the church, sex, sex, sex

David Bowie,"All our friends 
Now seem so thin and frail
Slinky secrets 
Hotter than the sun

No peachy frairs 
No trendy rechauffe
I'm with you 
So I can't go on

All my violence raining tears upon the sheets
I'm bewildered, for we're strangers when we meet

Blank screen tv 
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name 
But I'm over you

Blended sunrise
And it's a dying world
Humming Rheingold 
We scavenge up our clothes

All my violence, raging tears upon the sheets
I'm resentful, for we're strangers when we meet

Cold tired fingers 
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness 
Dazzled by the new

Your embrace 
It was all that I feared
That whirling room 
We trade by vendu

Steely resolve is falling from me
My poor soul, poor bruised passivity
All your regrets ran rough-shod over me
I'm so glad that we're strangers when we meet

I'm so thankful, cause we're strangers when we meet.
I'm in clover, for we're strangers when we meet.
Heel head over, cause we're strangers when we meet.

No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

Strung out on lasers and slash-back blazers

And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear

Kept his gun in quiet seclusion, such a humble man
The only survivor of the national people's gang
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions, they followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
And I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights

Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table, a gun and me alone
I ran to the window, looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit, he'd left me an autograph

There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us

Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows

David Bowie,"War made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier
Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade

Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier
Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless, lonely days
Then one day, in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longinly
At the ice-cream in the hand of
The little bombardier
Sunshine entered our Frankie's days

Gone his worries, his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his life was full of joy
Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coins he made
Then two gentlemen called him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game?
Leave them alone or we'll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said ""no more"" to

Packed his bags, his heart in pain
Wiped a tear, caught a train

Standing by the wall

And the guns, shot above our heads

And we kissed, as though nothing could fall

David Bowie,"They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down
He frowns, gee my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?

He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

All night
Young American, young American
She wants the young American
All night

Scanning life through the picture windows
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything

But the freak and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries, ""Where have all Papa's heroes gone?""

All night
Young American, young American
She wants the young American
All night

All the way from Washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
""We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?""

All night
Young American, young American
He wants the young American
All right

Do you remember your President Nixon?
Do you remember the bills you have to pay
Or even yesterday?

Have you been a hung American?
Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth, left from the ghetto

Well, well, well, would you carry a razor?
In case, just in case of depression
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro-Sheeners

Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll?
Her heart's been broken just like you have

All night
Young American, young American
He wants the young American
All right

You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady?s got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands shake

I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man you can say no more?
And, ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?

And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?

Ain't there one damn song that can make me
Break down and cry?

They spiral down
They tilt his head back
To the flame filled sunset
Raise their guns high
As the darken falls
These are the days boys

Shallow man
Shallow man... and they
Eats in the doorway
With his head inclined
And he's always in decline
No-one heals anymore
So he shrinks as they ride
Under vermillion sky

So it goes
Just a searcher
A lonely soul
The last of the dreamers

Speaks to the shadows
Moves his trembling hands
And he's always a little late
For the dawning of the day

So it goes

We can't avoid the clash, the big mistake
Now we're going to pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
Can't believe I'm asking you to go

To get the things we want
But we lost each other on the way

David Bowie,"I forgot what my father said, I forgot what he said
I forgot what my mother said as we laid on your bed
A city full of flowers, a city full of rain
I got seven days to live my life or seven ways to die

I forgot what my brother said, I forgot what he said
I don't regret anything at all, I remember how he wept
On a bridge of violent people, I was small enough to cry
I got seven days to live my life or seven ways to die

Hold my face before you still my trembling heart
Seven days to live my life or seven ways to die

The Gods forgot they made me so I forgot them to
I listen to their shadows, I play among their graves
My heart is never broken, my patience never tried
I got seven days to live my life or seven ways to die
Seven days to live my life or seven ways to die

Seven, seven, seven
Seven, seven, seven
Seven, seven, seven

David Bowie,"Oh my, naked eyes
I should have kept you, I should have tried
I should of been more wiser kind of guy
I miss you

Give me wings, give me space
Give me money for a change of face
There's noisy rooms and passion pants
I loved you

Where's the morning in my life?
Where's the sense in staying right? Who said time is on my side?
I've got ears and eyes and nothing in my life
But I survive your naked eyes, I'll survive

You alone across the floor, you and me and nothing more
You're the great mistake I never made
I never lied to you, I hate it when you lied
Then I'll survive your naked eyes, I'll survive

People boys all snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs every night
Wished I'd sent a Valentine
I loved you

I'll survive naked eyes, I'll survive
I'll survive my naked eyes, I'll survive
I'll survive, naked eyes, I'll survive
I'll survive, I'll survive

",Survive [Mix][*]
David Bowie,"No more delight or croning around
Whisper the word hold my hand
Nowhere forget I shall refuse you
Never forget who you've been
And you will fight with demons
And we shall go to town
And we'll read betwen the riches
And we'll dream if we don't go down

Follow the paths stay on the wrong side
Only when you is swollen with tears
Don't bring your things just like you serve you
Only fool turns around
And you will fight with demons
And we shall go to town
And you will wear you're best shoes
And we'll dance if we don't go down
And we'll dance if we don't go down

A million dead end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made

David Bowie,"Pushing through the market square, so many mothers sighing
News had just come over, we had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us, earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet, then I knew he was not lying
I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies
I saw boys, toys electric irons and T.V.'s
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head, hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off, I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest, and a queer
Threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlor, drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine, don't think
You knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

We've got five years, what a surprise

Well come on, well come on, if you think we're gonna make it

David Bowie,"When you climb to the top of the mountain

Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing

We bought a lot of things 
To keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow
And a book of rules
On what to say to people 
When they pick on you
'Cause if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty Kookie too

[CHORUS]

And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up 
This old fool
Don't pick fights with the bullies 
Or the cads

And if the homework brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire
And take the car downtown

And he's trying hard
To pull sister Flo

My weekend's at an all time low

'Cause she's hoping to score
So I can't see her

And bipperty-bopperty hat

Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames

Then she can do it,

But she's a Queen,
And such are queens

Is sucked in their brains

Oh the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while
And I gaze at my hotel wall

So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
'Cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all

It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say,

You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette

Ohh how how how, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clocks waits so patiently on your song

David Bowie,"In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping 
By a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked, why not, and I replied, I don't know
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped Kahlil Gibran
And I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

Ho
Oh I said so long and I waved bye-bye
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said you'll never go down to the Gods again
(Turn around, go back)

He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said do it again, do it again
(Turn around, go back)

His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said do it again, do it again

And I was seething, breathing deeply

David Bowie,"Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly,
And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

Now Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
'Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders, while the fly tried to break our balls
With just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kid was just crass, he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar

Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind

All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes

Seemed a good idea
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here
Only one man could be seen
And he was old and so serene
Captain sat in his deck chair
And the red light flashed Beware
Pilot felt quite big-time
As the bomb sailed through the air
Well, they danced and sang
When the bang went bang
When the lights popped out

In such an early song
I've heard a rumor from ground control
Oh no, don't say it's true

They got a message from the action man
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed love
Sordid details following""

The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet it's glowing

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know major tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too""
One flash of light but no smoking pistol

I never done good things
I never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Want to come down right now

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know major tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

You'd better not mess with major tom

In such an early song 
I've heard a rumor from Ground Control 
Oh no, don't say it's true 

They got a message from the Action Man 
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too 
I've loved all I've needed to love 
Sordid details following"" 

The shrieking of nothing is killing 
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I 
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair 
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet it's glowing 

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky 
We know Major Tom's a junkie 
Strung out in heaven's high 
Hitting an all-time low 

Time and again I tell myself 
I'll stay clean tonight 
But the little green wheels are following me 
Oh no, not again 
I'm stuck with a valuable friend 
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too"" 
One flash of light but no smoking pistol 

I never done good things I never done bad things 
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh 
Want an axe to break the ice 
Wanna come down right now 

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky 
We know Major Tom's a junkie 
Strung out in heaven's high 
Hitting an all-time low

Beating on blacks with a baseball bat

While you was gone, there was war

They put a Swastika over the door

Under the God, under the God
One step over the red line
Under the God, under the God
Ten steps into the crazy, crazy

Washington heads in the toilet bowl
Don't see supremacist hate
Right wing dicks in their boiler suits
Picking out who to annihilate

Toxic jungle of Uzi trails
Tribesmen just wouldn't live here
Fascist flare is fashion cool
Well, you're dead, you just ain't buried yet

Under the God, under the God
Under the God, under the God

As the walls came tumbling down
So, the secrets that we shared
I believed you by the palace gates
Now the savage days are here

Under the God

Under the God, under the God
One step over the red line
Under the God, under the God
One steps into the crazy, crazy

Hot headed creep with a knife
Love and peace and harmony
Love you could cut with a knife

They bear the cross of coeuf de leon
Salvation for the mirror blind

But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide the saddest view

And your prayers they break the sky in two

You pray til the break of dawn

And you'll believe you're loving the alien

No one knew what they could do 
Except for me and you

But the names it hurt poor jackson stopped the haters in his way
Heaven knows he's for it

Hey hey
He was never quite unsure but really sane
Wants to play

Jackson stole twenty souls in a day
To take away
A take away
He takes away

And no complaints
Heart's upon his sleeve and his blade
Wood jackson took the beating every day, given out, passed away, another way
Hey hey

Just wants to play
And how he played
The mob they bleed and tremble when they're running after life
Heaven knows he's really torn it now

The words that killed Wood jackson's friends were written on the wall
Heaven knows he's for it

David Bowie,"Pushing through the market square, so many mothers sighing
News had just come over, we had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us, earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet, then I knew he was not lying

I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys electric irons and T.V.'s
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head, hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off, I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest, and a queer threw up at the sight of that

I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour, drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine, don't think
You knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there

Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

David Bowie,"It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling ""No""
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on Amerika's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibeza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

If we can sparkle he may land tonight

The templars and the saracens
They're traveling the holy land
Opening telegrams

Torture comes and torture goes

They bear the cross of coeuf de leon
Salvation for the mirror blind

But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide the saddest view

And your prayers they break the sky in two

Stab you from the city spires

Or the crumpled paper it was written on

Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible

Cold cold nights under chrome and glass
Led me down river of perfumed limbs
Sent me to the streets with the good time girls

Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs
Killing time in the '70s
Smelling of love through the moist winds

Close me in the dark, let me disappear

She slips beneath the sheets

And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by I suppose

David Bowie,"Pushing through the market square, so many mothers sighing
News had just come over, we had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us, earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet, then I knew he was not lying

I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TV's
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there

And all the fat, skinny people, and all the tall, short people
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people
Never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head, hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off, I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And the queer threw up at the sight of that

I think I saw you in an ice cream parlor
Drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song

And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

and get it over with and just dump 'em on the boulevard

Get to end up, on the dirty boulevard
going out, to the dirty boulevard
He's going down, on the dirty boulevard
going out

Outside it's a bright night
there's an opera at Lincoln Center
movie stars arrive by limousine
The klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of Manhattan
but the lights are out on the Mean Streets

A small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel
he's selling plastic roses for a buck
The traffic's backed up to 39th street
the TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck

And back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming
he's found a book on magic in a garbage can
He looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling
""At the count of 3"" he says, ""I hope I can disappear""

And fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
I want to fly-fly-fly-fly, from dirty boulevard

I want to fly away
I want to fly

David Bowie,"It's the darkest hour, you're 22
The voice of youth, the hour of dread
The darkest hour, and your voice is new
Love is lost, and lost is love

Your country's new, your friends are new
Your house, and even your eyes are new
Your maid is new, and your accent too
But your fear is as old as the world

Oh what have you done

Say goodbye to the thrills of life
When love was good, when love was bad
Wave goodbye to the life without pain
Say hello, your beautiful girl

Say hello to the greater men
Tell them your secrets they're like the grave
Oh what you have done, oh what you have done
Love is lost, lost is love

Towards the lights the beacons above the hill

A fear of rear windows and swinging doors
A love of violence and dread of sighs

Swear to destroy the beasts, stamping the ground
In their excitement for tomorrow

And walk to the crossroads
So take this knife

The dust of cold flowers, prison of dark of ashes

Dead ones and the living

We live closer to the earth
Never to the heavens
The stars are never far away
Stars are out tonight

They watch us from behind their shades
Brigitte, Jack and Kate and Brad
From behind their tinted window stretch
Gleaming like blackened sunshine

Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

Waiting for the first move
Satyrs and their child wives
Waiting for the last move
Soaking up our primitive world

Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

Their jealousy's spilling down
The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever

And they know just what we do
That we toss and turn at night
They're waiting to make their moves
For the stars are out tonight

Here they are upon the stairs
Sexless and unaroused
They are the stars, they're dying for you
But I hope they live forever

They burn you with their radiant smiles
Trap you with their beautiful eyes
They're broke and shamed or drunk or scared
But I hope they live forever

Their jealousy's spilling down

We will never be rid of these stars

Buildings crammed with people
Landscape filled with wrath
Grey concrete city
Rain has wet the street

Before you close the door

You made sure of that

I can read you like a book
I can feel you falling
I hear you moaning in your room

Oh, please, please make it soon

Hold my hand and
I’ll take you there
Who will I become
In the USA?
Hold my hand and
I’ll take you there

These are the days
The days of gloom

A mile to the future
Where tomorrow is king

What will be my name
In the USA?
Hold my hand and
I’ll take you there
Who will I become
In the USA?
Hold my hand and
I’ll take you there

I don’t need to know
Know where you are
Only that you are
Safe in this world
Then I’ll be content
To get on with my life
Eat, drink and sleep
Look up at the stars

What will be my name
In the USA?
Hold my hand and
I’ll take you there
Who will I become
In the USA?
Hold my hand and
I’ll take you there

David Bowie,"For the priceless man
Who suffers gloom
So slow
Eyes were stolen
For her
A sleeping sky
Takes the moon
So slow
I would slide away
Further out to sea

So she

David Bowie,"Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly,
And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

Now Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
'Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders, while the fly tried to break our balls
With just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kid was just crass, he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar

Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.

Ziggy played guitar",Red Sails [Live]

David Bowie,"Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song
I've heard a rumor from ground control
Oh no, don't say it's true

They got a message from the action man
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed love
Sordid details following""

The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet it's glowing

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know major tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
""I'm happy, hope you're happy too""
One flash of light but no smoking pistol

I never done good things
I never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Want to come down right now

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know major tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with major tom
My mother said to get things done

Where I will live
Blue, blue

Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue

And I will sing, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude, over my head

Thunder sound under the Milky Way

Be

The waves crash through the salt against my skin

Of paradise, where roses grew

David Byrne,"What A Day That Was
Well, I'm dressed up so nice
An' I'm doin' my best
Yes I'm startin' over
Startin' over in another place

Lemme tell you a story
Big chief with a golden crown
He's got rings on his fingers
And then he walks up, up to the throne

He's makin' shapes with his hands
An' don't you dare sit down
Now don't you dare sit back
And don't you dare speak up!

[Chorus]
And on the first day, we had everything we could 
hold
Oh and then we let it fall
And on the second day, there was nothing else left 
to do
Oh what a day that was.

There are 50,000 beggars
Roaming in the streets
They have lost all their possessions
They have nothing left to eat

Down come the bolts of lightning
Now an electrical storm
Starts a chain reaction
Go pull a fire alarm

I'm dreaming of a city
It was my own invention
And I put the wheels in motion
A time for big decisions

[Chorus]

Oh a day that was
Oh that's the way it goes
There's a million ways, to get things done
Three's a million ways, to make things work out.

Well I'm going right through
And the light came down
Well they're roundin' 'em up
from all over town

They're movin' forward and back
They're movin' backwards and front
And they're enjoying themselves
Moving in every direction

So if you feel like you`re in a whirlpool
You feel like going home
And if you feel like talking to someone
Who knows the difference between right and wrong

[Chorus]

We're goin' boom boom boom 
That's the way we live
And in a great big room and 
That's the way we live.",What a Day That Was

David Byrne,"I thought that if I ate the food of the area I was visiting.
That I might assimilate the point of view of the people there.
As if the point of view was somehow in the food.
So I would make no choices myself regarding what food I ate.

I would simply follow the examples of those around me.
I would study menus very carefully,
Making note of important differences and similarities.
When shopping at the supermarket

I felt a great desire to walk off with someone else's groceries
So that I could study them at length
And study their effects on me.
As though if I ate their groceries I would become that person; until I finished their groceries.

And we might find ourselves going to the same places.
Running into one another at the movies
Or in a shopping mall.
Reading the same books.

Watching the same TV programmes.
Wearing the same clothes.
Travelling to the same places.
And taking the same pictures.

Getting sick at the same time.
And getting well again simultaneously.
Finding ourselves attracted to the same people.
Working at the same job.

And making the same amount of money.
Living identical lives - as long as the groceries lasted.",Social Studies
David Byrne,"They were driving south on the highway
Their business was in another town
Bigger than the town they were driving from.
Business took place during office hours in both towns.
This drive was considered business
The feeling of passing other cars was also considered business
A feeling of business being done.
The feeling of drifting slowly through a field of moving vehicles.
This was the REAL speed - the speed of business.
Not the numbers on the speedometer.
One of them was playing with the radio
Slowly changing the channel from one station to another
Sometimes listening to both channels at once.
On one channel a man was talking to another man on the telephone.
The other channel was playing oldies

David Byrne,"Today is an important occasion.
She thinks that she must wear the right clothes.
The right combination of clothes - will make her lucky.
But there are specific kinds of luck - and different kinds are are needed - for different occasions:

'A blue dress for intuition'
'The grey shirt and maroon slacks - for making strong statements'
'The navy pullover - and her woolen skirt - for discovering mystery'

She thinks of what she wore - on a similar occasion - like the one she will be involved in today.
Particularly a similar occasion - that was successful for her.
She lies on the bed - and imagines herself in a variety of outfits.
She quickly narrows - the range of possibilities.

She tries them on - in a few combinations.
The striped shirt - and corduroy slacks.
The red dress.
She leaves the house - the outcome - is certain.",Tree (Today Is an Important Occasion)

David Byrne,"I saw a princess, she's riding the IRT
She raised her eyes and I thought that she looked at me
In a disco I thought that I'd seen her before
She got married, and now she don't dance no more

She knew the doorman at every club in town
She'd go out dancing and stay out 'til early dawn
When they'd start throwing down, she would clear the floor
She got married and now she don't dance no more

The lights go out, the train is dark
Nobody moves, nobody talks...

She keeps her body well-hidden beneath her clothes
Where will we go when the club's all closed?
In comes a business man, and he pretends not to see
That there's a princess, and she's riding the IRT
In comes a homeless man, she gives some money to him
Now she gets off, must be the end of the line

Stopping briefly in Japan during the '60s
In Tienanman Square, during the last decade

What're they looking for?
A Messiah who never comes?
A virgin birth?
A perfect drunk?

Any kind of sign
Anything that looks slightly out of the ordinary

Daddy's bringin' home the bacon

I can barely touch my own self
How could I touch someone else?

Like a million nervous tics
I am quivering with anticipation
Like the sunlight on their wings

I'm ready now
(I'm ready for this)
I'm ready now

The sweat off their wings ? the fruit from
the trees

All in my neighborhood
Say boy, say girl
We got peace love & monkey business 
Gonna reach the very top
There'll be pride, hope & Sunday mornings 
All the things I'm thinking of
We could change the world 
In the night while we are sleeping


Now the rich get richer
& the poor stay poor
& folks get restless
If it don't change soon

But there's a sweet sensation
Turnin bad to good
& things get better
In my neighborhood 

So burn on - you little candle - put your light into my head
There's a lone wolf - on the mountain - he's the friend you never had
We got peace, love & monkey business - gonna reach the very top
There'll be - pride, hope & Sunday mornings - all the things I'm thinking of

So, come on down",Neighborhood
David Byrne,"Amplifiers and old guitars
Country music sung in bars
And when she sings the revolution's near

Beauty holds the microphone
And watches as we stumble home
And she can see the revolution now

Dirt and fish and trees and houses
Smoke and hands up women's blouses
Not like I expected it would be

Bubbles pop in every size
It's analyzed and criticized
And beauty knows that it is almost here

Beauty goes to her address
She shuts the door and climbs the stairs
And when she sleeps the revolution grows

Beauty rests on mattress strings
Wearing just her underthings
And when she wakes the revolution's here
And when she wakes the revolution's here",The Revolution
David Byrne,"Smile when tears are falling from your eyes
Smile like windows of the shops at night

Here - everything is as it seems
All - the tables & the chairs seem real
Here - paintings on the walls
Somehow make it all so strange

So smile - to brighten up the darkest day
Your smile - like icing on a birthday cake

Lovers - floating in a paradise
Blue - lights flicker from a room at night
I'm happy just to be just like one of these who smile

How we sang
How we loved
How we were
& How we was
We're not afraid anymore

I'm scared of you 
I'm scared of me
But scary things
Will set me free
I'm not afraid anymore

So smile - when nothing seems to go your way
Smiles - to take away our thoughts & cares
Blue - like blood returning to my heart
Fingers, Hands and every tiny part
Every kid in every school
Knows all you've got to do is - smile

How we sang
How we loved
How we were
& how we was
We're not afraid anymore

Day turns to Night
Immaterial play of light

They flew out around my face
I guess it's just self defense

The focus shifts

Part of me wants to tear it down

Havin' a ball in a padded banquet
I'm gonna be that really cool guy someday 

The waiter looks me over
Would you like cream or sugar?
I don't know, what was I supposed to say 

She wonders if I'll notice
I should have brought some roses
Her plate is full, she hasn't eaten all day 

Glasses collect we order some booze
She looks at me, I stare at her shoes
Mature situations, maybe a broken heart 

Maybe I ought to pay the bill
Maybe she thinks I never will

Just be yourself, well that's what they say

I'm gonna be that civilized guy someday

The brothers they are equal
But the old friends of today

And the violent man has come down on everyone

To whom can I speak today
The wrong which roams the earth
There can be no end to it

To see home after many years in jail

Like starin' at the ceiling
My sleepy eyes, you smell so nice
It's such a funny feeling

Got no idea, what time it is
Delightfully confusing
The trees outside, the morning light
Arrives, like pirates on parade

Surprise, it's pirates on parade
A ray of light, between the blinds
I lie there in a stupor
I hear a thud, and then a flush

Guess it must be the neighbors
I blink my eyes, I laugh inside
Imagine what they're saying
I see your shape and through the night

Here come, those pirates on parade
Ahoy, it's pirates on parade
Through the rough and stormy weather
On a search for buried treasure

There's an island to explore
Every wave that whispers softly
""Stay in bed, 'cause it's still early""
Dolphins frolic by the shore

And the phone never rings when the pirates are singing
Well there's 16 men on a dead man's chest
In this hallucination
The map we got, x marks the spot

We're following directions
The 7 seas, the balmy breeze
The pleasure of surrender
The end is nigh, the sun is high

It's late, for pirates on parade
Too late, for pirates on parade
Traffic noises down below me
A helicopter circles slowly

Monsters sink into the deep
Mountainous and downy billows
Float among those fluffy pillows
Maybe I'll go back to sleep

And the phone never rings when the pirates are singing
This wicked life
So what's in store behind that velvet curtain?
The night is gone

And the day is here
The stupid sun is shinin'

Packed up and ready to go
Heard of some grave sites, out by the highway,
A place where nobody knows
The sound of gunfire, off in the distance,
I'm getting used to it now
Lived in a brownstone, lived in the ghetto,
I've lived all over this town

This ain't no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey,
I ain't got time for that now

Hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, a couple of visas,
You don't even know my real name
High on a hillside, the trucks are loading,
Everything's ready to roll
I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nighttime,
I might not ever get home

This ain't no party, this ain't no disco,
This ain't no fooling around
This ain't no Mudd Club, or C. B. G. B.,
I ain't got time for that now
Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit?
Heard about Pittsburgh, P. A.?
You oughta know not to stand by the window
Somebody might see you up there
I got some groceries, some peanut butter,
To last a couple of days
But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no
Headphones, ain't got no records to play

Why stay in college? Why go to night school?
Gonna be different this time
Can't write a letter, can't send a postcard,
I can't write nothing at all

We blended with the crowd
We got computer, we're tapping phone lines,
I know that ain't allowed
We dress like students, we dress like housewives,
Or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle, so many times now,
I don't know what I look like!
You make me shiver, I feel so tender,
We make a pretty good team
Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving,
You ought to get some sleep
Get you instructions, follow directions,
Then you should change your address
Maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day,

They won't help me survive

Pick me up and turn me around
I feel numb, burn with a weak heart

Feet on the ground, head in the sky
It's okay, I know nothing's wrong, nothing

You got light in your eyes
And you're standing here beside me

Never for money, always for love
Cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight

Home, is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home, she lifted up her wings
I guess that this must be the place

I can't tell one from the other
I find you, or you find me?
There was a time before we were born
If someone asks, this is where I'll be, where I'll be

We drift in and out
Sing into my mouth
Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view

I'm just an animal looking for a home
And share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me till my heart stops
Love me till I'm dead

Eyes look through you

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody

With somebody who loves me

Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Somebody oo Somebody oo
Somebody who loves me yeah
Somebody oo Somebody oo
To hold me in his arms oh
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Don'tcha wanna dance with me baby
Dontcha wanna dance with me boy
Hey Don'tcha wanna dance with me baby
With somebody who loves me

David Byrne,"You may find yourself living in a shotgun shack
And you may find yourself in another part of the world
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
You may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
You may ask yourself, ""Well, how did I get here?""

Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

And you may ask yourself, ""How do I work this?""
And you may ask yourself, ""Where is that large automobile?""
And you may tell yourself, ""This is not my beautiful house""
And you may tell yourself, ""This is not my beautiful wife""

Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was

Water dissolving and water removing
There is water at the bottom of the ocean
Under the water, carry the water
Remove the water from the bottom of the ocean

Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground

Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

You may ask yourself, ""What is that beautiful house?""
You may ask yourself, ""Where does that highway go to?""
You may ask yourself, ""Am I right, am I wrong?""
You may say to yourself, ""My God! What have I done?""

David Byrne,"I ride on a perfect freeway
Many people on that road
I heard the sound of someone laughing
I saw my neighbor's car explode

Just up ahead
Against the sky
Quicker than you blink your eye

Oh my brother, I still wonder, are you alright?
And among the living, we are giving, all through the night

From the milk of human kindness
From the breast we all partake
Hungry for a social contract
She welcomes you with dark embrace

(Puts) socks and shoes
Upon our feet
Little fishes swim upstream

Oh my brother, I still wonder, are you alright?
In the deepest silence, gold and diamonds, all through the night

David Byrne,"The dimming of the light makes the picture clearer
It's just an old photograph, there's nothing to hide
When the world was just beginning

I memorized her face so it's not forgotten
I hear the wind whistle in, come back anytime
And we'll mix our lives together
Heaven knows, what keeps mankind alive
Every hand goes searching for its partner in crime
Under chairs and behind tables
Connecting to places we have known

I'm looking for a home, where the wheels are turning
Home, why I keep returning
Home, where my world Is breaking in two
Home, with the neighbors fighting
Home, always so exciting
Home, were my parents telling the truth?
Home, such a body feeling
Home, no one ever speaking
Home, with our bodies touching
Home, and the cameras watching
Home, will infect whatever you do
Where home, comes to life from out of the blue

Tiny little box from a beach at sunset
I took a drink from a jar and into my head
Familiar smells and flavors
Vehicles are stuck on the plains of heaven
I've seen their wheels spinning round
And everywhere I can hear those people saying
That the eye is the measure of the man
You can fly from the stuff that spills around you
We're home and the band keeps marching on
Connecting to every living sole
Compassion for things I'll never know",Home
David Byrne,"I think I waited too long
I'm moving into the dollhouse
Some days we exercise
Some days we harmonize
Look away, look away, look away, oh yeah

Emily said she'd suddenly waken
Look at that guy with the government coupon
Yoo hoo, yoo hoo, gonna get you
Japanese chairs in somebody's concert
Telephone bills on the company paycheck
Who knew?, who knew?, I do

Emily lost her mobile phone
Last nights dance on a bumpy road
I won't go out in the cold
Lebanese Chinese in my school
Imagine who can make you cool
Who's gonna pay for this call?

The cheapest dog, the hottest sun, the fiercest cat and the meanest gun
You got to hold the peelings in your hands, baby
It's a safety belt, it's a Christian crime, a rocket ship, it's a joke of mine
I took away the day that I'd be gone- shoot!

Lebanese take their sailors home
The broken stuff in the outer wall
I'm sticking out in the road
Memorize toilets, Chang Mai School
I like my song but I lost my cool
I need my laser, don't move

Put him in the ground where the Duchess grows
Where the word is true and the girls are strong
Gonna stuff it, step it, pick it, going bye
Take another life of a wretched soul
When they get too high where the bushes grow
They rope it, squeeze it, push it side to side

The chicken shack, the rising sun, the written word in a foreign tongue
You got to hold it all before it drops, baby
It's a little bit, it's a lot inside, it's a bigger thing than you can hide
I took away the parts that need controlling

Hooligans jump in the budget sign
In the tropic zone, where the fix is fine
Gonna chase it, place it, face it with my eye
Stinky little bird in a dirty tree
Gonna figure out it's your lucky day
If ya smell it, sell it, tell it to my ear

Lowered in the ground where the Duchess grows
Where the word is true and the girls are strong
Gonna stuff it, step it, pick it, going bye
Take another life of a wretched soul
If they get too high where the bushes grow
And they rope it, squeeze it, push it side to side

David Byrne,"Everybody says that the living is easy
I can barely see cause my head's in the way
Tigers walk behind me, they are to remind me that
I'm lost, but I'm not afraid

Soul to soul, A kiss and a sigh
Sawed in half, by the passage of time
Halfway home, from a window you see
Chains and bars, but I am still free

People on the outside, I remember sweet times
This old rose, is always in bloom
Everybody's happy, to be a baby daddy
Stone love, with nothing to lose

Life is long, if you give it way
So stay, don't go, cause I'm fading away
Soul to soul, between you and me
Chain me down, but I am still free

Now I can say, those three little words
And every day, I'm dreaming a world
Soul to soul, a kiss and a sigh
Holding back, the waters outside.

So stay, don't go, cause I'm fading away

David Byrne,"I'll build a house, of water
I'm searching high, and low
Underneath the waves
Where they hit the rocky shore
Out by the lighthouse

Heard nature say
""I'm sorry,
For stones and trees down below
For those who tumble in God's name
To an early grave
Into the sea and foam
Like ships tossed in a storm""
And I'm standing all alone
Out by the lighthouse

I'll build a house, of paper
Covered with words I could read
She had to teach me what to say
But every year we stayed
Out by the lighthouse

I'll build a house, so level
With 7 walls, long and true
The day we raised that roof up high
Unto the fading light
We sang the whole night through
No one needed proof
And I could see the moon
Out by the lighthouse",The Lighthouse
David Byrne,"When the lake's on fire
With all the world's desires
When he shakes the stars above
When we lose the ones we love

When the seasons lose their grip
When the tightrope walker slips

I'm counting all the possibilities

When the past becomes the now
When the lost becomes the found
When we fall in love with war
When the angel fucks the whore

When the road we travel on
Takes us back where we came from

A million kinds of possibilities
For dancing on this lazy afternoon

In the comfort of the world
In the arms of my big nurse
From the science of the heart
To each animal and plant

Compact, relaxed, intact, give thanks

I'm counting all the possibilities
For dancing on this lazy afternoon",My Big Nurse
David Byrne,"Saw the wanderin' eye, inside my heart
Shouts and battle cries, from every part
I can see those tears, every one is true
When the door appears, I'll go right through, oh

I stand in liquid light, like everyone
I built my life with rhymes, to carry on
And it gives me hope, to see you there
The things I used to know, that one fine

[Chorus: x2]
One fine day

In a small dark room- where I will wait
Face to face I find- I contemplate
Even though a man- is made of clay
Everything can change- that one fine-

[Chorus: x3]

Then before my eyes, is standing still
I beheld it there, a city on a hill
I complete my tasks, one by one
I remove my masks, when I am done

Then a piece of mind, fell over me
In these troubled times, I still can see
We can use the stars, to guide the way
It is not that far, the one fine

[Chorus: x4]",One Fine Day
David Byrne,"A truck parked this morning, outside the grocery store
Friends face the future, they're wearing summer clothes

Great cosmic forces, like falling dominoes
I love talking funny, it's the only song I know

Sweet smart and sexy, the day my life began
Burnt out and damaged, I dragged my body home

This slice is runny, it's dripping down my clothes
Flies stick to honey, it's the only game they know

Poor Boy, I walk into the river in my hat and shoes
Poor Boy, I'm sitting at the table with a knife and spoon

Life fast die happy, don't let your panties show
They trust market forces, it's the only song they know

So come and rock my soul, where sin and sorry lie
White horses carry me, unto the other side

Poor boy, I'm living in a country where my thoughts are cold
Poor boy, I'm waiting for the harvest of the seeds I sow

A flower in the night, with thoughts of days gone by
I've got to ring that bell, and I'll be satisfied

Poor boy, I'm wearing silver slippers and a long white gown
Poor boy, I picture in my mind the day the walls come down

Poor boy, I'm living in a country where I'm never free
Poor boy, I'm writing down the names of all the things I see",Poor Boy
David Byrne,"So deep in the water
Sleep, dark as the night
Somehow it seems it was all another dream
Soon dissolved in the light.

Oh, we were by the waterline.

Vague, the song of the night.

Innocent to all the peasant gods with you,
So, we drink to be renewed.

On the long, deep river
Where the moorhens cry
As the first sun quivers in the open sky,
Oh, she came down the river.

Soon, all the leaves were still.

The current was strong and the river was so long.

So, we drink to be renewed.

In the long cool evening,
Where the peacocks shiver
And the boat starts down the silver river way

I remember you saying,
As her deep eyes opened,
In the first light seeing her,
Here is someone new.",The River
David Byrne,"I wake up every morning
I hear your feet on the stairs
You're in the next apartment
I hear you singing over there

This groove is out of fashion
These beats are 20 years old
I saw you lend a hand to
The ones out standing in the cold

Strange Overtones in the music you are playing
I'll harmonize
It is strong and you are tough
But a heart is not enough

Put on your socks and mittens
It's getting colder tonight
A snowball in my kitchen
I watched it melt before my eyes

Your song still needs a chorus
I know you'll figure it out
The rising of the verses
A change of key will let you out

Strange overtones though they're slightly out of fashion
I'll harmonize
I see the music in your face
That your words cannot explain

Da deselegância discreta de tuas meninas
Ainda não havia para mim Rita Lee

A desert at dawn
A mountain at night
And the river moves on

The people awake
They're marching along
The streets are alive
With a terrible song

Forwards and backwards in ev'ry direction
The atom's perpetual motion
The shifting of light on the banks of the river
I'm free but I'm keeping my clothes on

We're marching along
The street where you live
I'm calling your name
The song is a gift

A song is a road
A road is a face
A face is a time
And a time is a place

A place of belief and a time of confusion
The heart is a simple equation
With beautiful words and with beautiful people
A song is a face is a mountain

A fruit that falls before it's grown
I heard a sound and bird has flown
It breaks pieces above the forest
A million particles born today

Out beyond the blue horizon
Air cannot escape
Underneath the weeping willow
I can see your face

Free form - climbing all over me
Creatures great and small
Doctors - pulling them out of you
Hideous, virtuous, both of us

Come - in my kitchen 
When it rains outside
Sweet inspiration 
Sneaks up from behind

The forest is true 
I know for a fact
That the bigger the front 
The bigger the back

Through the perilous night
The bombs burst in air

But somehow the beauty will find you",The Forest Awakes

His expression, tender yearning
Ev’ry nation near and far

Sweet as honey, tough as leather
Running down the hill on Christmas day

I am an ape—I stand and wait
A masterpiece—a hairy beast
I move so fast—but take a chance
And come up close—I’m not a ghost

Navigator, when you wake up… And you step outside your door
Shoes and panties—washed and folded… Taking o your dirty clothes

This garden tells a story
Amber close up, faded glory
Running through the streets on Christmas day

I am an ape—I stand and wait
A masterpiece—a hairy beast
Try not to laugh—just take a chance
I visited—inside your head

If you trespass—in this garden… To a place you should not go
If you step out, from the shadows… See the city far below

A masterpiece—a hairy beast
No need to hide—come on inside
I will not last—I too shall pass",I Am an Ape
David Byrne,"I used to think that I should watch TV
I used to think that it was good for me
Wanted to know what folks were thinking
To understand the land I live in
And I would lose myself
And it would set me free

This is the place where common people go
A global franchise, one department store
Yes, there were many awkward moments
I had to do some self-atonement
Well, if I opened up
Well, it would set me free

I know, I like
Behold and love this giant
Big soul, big lips
That's me and I am this
Everybody is a touched up hairdo
Everybody's in the passing lane
Had a reason that she touched all channels
The weird things that live in there

I took a walk down to the park today
I wrote a song called, 'Just Like You and Me'
I heard the jokes from the sports reporter
The rival teams when they faced each other
The more I lost myself, the more it set me free

How am I not your brother?
How are you not like me?
Everybody's in the hotel lobby
I'm living in here, yes, I am
I feel it moving in my arms and fingers
Touch me and feel happy

It's good to lose and it's good to win sometimes
It's good to die and it's good be alive
Maybe someday we can stand together
Not afraid of what our eyes might see
Maybe someday understand them better

But it moves too quick for a picture
There's a funny lightning 'round the corner 
Hiding but I'm too smart just to catch it with gloves and rubber
So I stay put right here, watching the sky for tears
Let the fools and cowboys roar to wrecks

But if I should wake up and find my home's in half
Who is it?
Blame nature
I guess I have to laugh
And if I should wake up and find my bed 
Has moved six inches, six closer to the west

But this funny lightning I wanna invite in if I could learn how to teach it
I salt the corners of my room because, because a ghost can never be too careful

Oh nature, I hope you have a laugh

And they made that

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that

They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn

I've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely too long.)
I've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely.)

As I look back,
I can see me lost and searching.
Now I find that I can choose, I'm free. Oh, Yeah!
So funny I just have to laugh,

Makes it worth the time I've waited.

Everything gonna turn out right.
I've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely too long).
I've been lonely too long. (He's been lonely.)

Now look at me
Gliding through this world of beauty
Everything I do brings ecstasy, Oh, Yeah!
No wonder I could die
I feel like I'm 'bout ten miles high!

Lonely too long. (He's been lonely.)

Found myself somebody. (He's been lonely)

David Cassidy,"Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a summer
Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a time
I guess I never took the time to tell you how much I love you
Now you and the road keep flashing through my mind
You and the road keep flashing through my mind

I caught a sunrise service on a Sunday in North Dakota
Imagine you and me singing in a gospel choir
Spent a rainy night on a river in Oklahoma
Saw the northern lights on a Minnesota night
And our souls went a little bit higher

Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a summer
Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a time
I guess I never took the time to tell you how much I love you
Oow, you and the road keep flashing through my mind
You and the road keep flashing through my mind

The old De Soto died on a hill
It couldn't climb in Montana
The kid who bought the wreck said
What the heck, I'll give you a thirty five

So we were on our own
Had our thumbs to take us home to California
By the time we made Denver
With our truck drivin' friend we had wheels on fire

Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a summer
Didn't we have ourselves some kind of a time
I guess I never took the time to tell you how much I love you
Now you and the road keep flashing through my mind
You and the road keep flashing through my mind
You and the road, you and the road on my mind

I won't even begin to say
That you never looked better
Never looked so good to me
Though I've asked this before
I won't ever ask anything more
Just close your eyes and please
Do this for me.
And if this is the last kiss
If this is the last touch...

If you've ever been a lover she's got what you're looking for.

Romance across a crowded room she looked so right.
And suddenly the whole world just stood still
I knew I had to move or I'd blow my chance making sweet
Romance she had the spark to set my heart on fire.
Romance I knew she felt me burning with desire.
And as I reached to ask her for her hand
She offered me a look I'll never forget.
For tonight you're mine
Darling
We can take our time.
Turn the lights down low
Tonight I feel like letting go
And making sweet
Romance then I stroke your hair
Feel your face.
Romance I feel you start to move with such grace.
I hold you in my arms
You tremble and shake
And when I kiss your mouth it thrills me to death.
For tonight you're mine

Sometimes a heart has a mind of its own
Sometimes
I can tell myself that I'm better off bein' alone
Sometimes
But this time I can't hide from the thought of it
It's all around every corner I turn
Right there in lights - black and white
Why everything's wrong
It's all because of you that I feel this way
All because of you that my heart wants to break
If every other love can be forgotten
It's all because of you
Tonight I can't feel any magic at all
Inside
'Cause I can't reach out for the stars
Lookin' up at the moon on my own
No signs of life - no nothin's right
Since you been gone
It's all because of you that I feel this way
All because of you that my heart wants to break
If every other love can be forgotten
It's all because
All because of you I can't sleep at night
Oh no - I can't sleep at night
There ain't no rest livin' second best
Without your love
You don't know what it's like
To feel this way
All because of you that my heart wants to break
If every other love can be forgotten
It's all because
It's all because of you that I feel this way
All because of you that my heart wants to break

I'm goin' out of my mind

When you kissed me goodbye it was the kiss of death
Ever since you left
There's no livin' without you

I'd give anything to taste your kiss of life

The secrets you keep

It's eating at my pride

How can we lie here with each other baby

For all the nights we spend in silence
Afraid of what we'll say
Can we ever get it back

When I needed you and you needed me
Just look me in the eye
Stand here face to face

With time you might live to forgive and forget

But it just ain't no use

Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about
I got so much to think about

Hey, I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will

There's no bridge I wouldn't cross
There's no river that's too wide
If you leave me, I would search for you, baby
Nothin' could keep me away

Don't you deny it, baby
Holding back love can cause you real pain
This is our one chance
So don't lose it, baby

Here comes the rest of your life once again
We gotta grab this with both hands
And we should never let it go, now we've got each other
Oh, I want the world to know

There's no bridge I wouldn't cross
There's no river that's too wide
If you leave me I would search for you, baby
Nothin' could keep me away

And I'll succeed at any cost
There's no bridge I wouldn't cross
All I want is just to be with you, baby
Hold you once again in my arms

Somebody told me, boy
You've got so much to learn
But they didn't know I heard all the lyin'
Done all my cryin', now it's got to be my turn

There's no bridge I wouldn't cross
There's no river that's too wide
If you leave me I would search for you, baby
Nothin' could keep me away

And I'll succeed at any cost
'Cause there's no bridge I wouldn't cross

It's one of those things for the pain it brings
You say to yourself 'Hey couldn't I live without it?''
Well, I think so, on the other hand, I doubt it

Well suddenly she's crashing through my mind
Like waves upon the shore (like waves upon the shore)
And I nod my head, whoa yes love, I'd welcome you again
If you knocked upon my door (If you knocked upon my door)
If you didn't, I'd seek you out love, I'd track you down for sure

It's a pain in the neck, it'll make you a wreck if it gets ya
It's so insane 'cause for all the rain
When you ask yourself could you do it all again, you betcha

I hear a voice say you got no chance
And it makes me mad and I shout, 'Oh yeah, who says so?'
Well, of course not, on the other hand, I guess so

Oh We.. I'd know he'd never bite me.. oh no
We.. would know he'd never bite me.. oh no

If only I could have a friend
To stick with me until the end
To walk along beside the sea
And share a bit of moon with me
I'd take my friend most everywhere
Lalalala I wouldn't care
But we would stay away from crowds 
And signs that said no friends allowed

Oh we would be so happy together.. Oh yeah
We would be so happy to be

And a wish is just a dream 
You wish to come true

Dreams are nothing more than wishes
And a wish is just a dream
You wish to come true

And a wish it just a dream

David Cassidy,"I feel the sunlight on my face 
When I just close my eyes and I trace
The footpath to your daddy's summer place 
Where we spent our early summer days

The hill we climbed that went on forever
We reached the top of the world together

Yeah, you gave your love to me and I remember perfectly
High above all time and space and I remember summer days
When you gave your love to me and I remember perfectly
High above all time and space and I remember summer days

Come climb that hill again with me; come live that love again with me
Baby, baby, baby, baby; hold my hand and we'll be free; said we'll be
Free

Gone from my life and I stare like a dummy against the wall
Since you've been away, oh yes, I am uptight
It's a fact of my life, I guess, I'll try to fight
I could be so good for you if I had that right, if I had that right

You are always on my mind
If I got to go through this old life
Day after day and find
You there on my mind

You are always on my mind
If I got to go through this old life
Day after day and find
You there on my mind

I don't understand you at all but I don't care
Still a lot of good love in our lives for us to share

You might think it's sad
But I'm together now, yeah, you laugh, huh
I know it's true I'm much better now
You ought to come on by and see for yourself, just how
Oh, I'm much better now

Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
I'm sleeping
And right in the middle of a good dream
Like all at once I wake up
From something that keeps knockin' at my brain.
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed
Screaming out the words I dread:
""I think I love you!""
This morning
I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with
And so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And didn't I go and shout it
When you walked into my room.
""I think I love you!""
I think I love you.
So what am I so afraid of?
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
A love there is no cure for.
I think I love you.
Isn't that what life is made of?
Though it worries me to say
I've never felt this way.
I don't know what I'm up against.
I don't know what it's all about.
I got so much to think about.
Hey, I think I love you.
So what am I so afraid of?
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
A love there is no cure for.
I think I love you.
Isn't that what life is made of?
Though it worries me to say
I've never felt this way.
Believe me,
You really don't have to worry.
I only want to make you happy
And if you say,
""Hey, go away,"" I will, but I think better still
I'd better stay around and love you.
Do you think I have a case?
Let me ask you to your face:
Do you think you love me?
I think I love you.
Oh, I think I love you.
Oh, I think I love you.
Oh, I think I love you.
Oh, I think I love you.
Oh, I think I love you.
Oh, I think I love you.

David Cavazos,"Solamente tú, sólo amor y tú 
Aunque a veces sólo en lágrimas te tengo 
A pesar del alma cuando muere adentro 
Y jamás se acaba el pensamiento 
Y me faltas tanto todo el tiempo 
Solamente tú, sólo amor y tú 
Cómo dueles cada día 
Cómo alcanzo esa emoción 
Que siempre llevas a escondidas 

Cómo hacer que vuelvas 
Cómo hacer que sepas 
Dónde está la vida 
Dónde está la vida 
Cómo puedo cambiar este encierro 
Que inventas 
Tan sólo de cosas perdidas

David Chaney,"Its Bad Boy bitch
Scram Jones the Clipse B.I.G.
Let's go

Niggas in my faction don't like asking questions
Strictly gun testing, coke measuring
Giving pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hitting fanny, spendin' chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Muah!, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Leer
Yes my dear shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lying
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big dangerous you're just a Likkle Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success, escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death controls y'all
Big don't fold y'all, (big don't fold y'all)
I spit phrases that'll thrill you, (thrill you)
You're nobody till somebody kills you (I don't wanna die)

[Chorus]
Do you know where your going too
Just a memoryeverybody dying
When I throw my clip in the AK
May you rest in peace
Your nobody till somebody kills you
Do you know where your goin too
Just a memoryso you better pack a pistol
Everybody dying, death controls y'all
Your nobody till somebody kills you

Label limbo, I treat it like the wind blows
My back don't bend, see papi is my kinfolk
Spin out the work, as if its on a ten spoke
Soul benefactor the Benz, he made the rims poke
Trust me they can't touch P, in one touchie
Turn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy
Admire the verses, their inspired by the hearses
That carried my niggas, and had the church mothers cursing
Imagine the glamor that comes out the flow
Of a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa
The wrist is rushing, my ears is blushing
And the diamonds in my chain, big as grandma's buttons, (yes!)
On the flip side, the steel I'm gripping
You thought all the floss had me slipping?
Think again, blink again let me know that your bluffing
Lead give permanent concussion, your nothing

[Chorus]

Ha ha ha ha ha check out the fisad
On the face of rap, so we gon raise the bar
A mil on the crib, mean a quarter on the car
Bentley coupe another short of the arnage
Even as a youth I was laundering the stoop
Underneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue
I was pushing keys in a V with no roof
Rich, black, two big guns and no coof
Things at the label, well they tend to get unstable
And that pretty much leave Malice at the table
Or over the stove with the flame to the ladle
Because I'm a provider as long as I am able
This here hughe the most foolish of blues
When I tell my mom the price
She damn near sent me to my room
It's the M-A-L-I-C-I-O-U-S
You don't wanna try nigga, you next uh

Can only mend my lonely heart

Falling on my feet
Nearby ants on the ground
Building bridges and towns

Even the sun, goes through trouble
Shining her light, fighting rubble
Looking for diamonds like the stars
Up so high and down so far

Nobody knows what's going on
So much around, yet so much is gone
Out with the old, in with the new
Just sit back and enjoy the view

A look at the time
You hear the bell chime
Take off your shoes
Fill up your space
And live with a grace
To find all things true
Beautiful and new

Don't close your eyes
It's splendor in disguise

When we broke up
In September

I haven't seen you
Feels like a long time
Sometimes it still hurts
But I always get by

I still got a piece of you under my skin

I'll pretend that I didn't see

Al destino que a ella

The daylight had already passed me
It was such a fight to fade away asleep
It's a fugue
Come on
Found the chase down the dawn
And I fell every night as it turns
Into light with my eyes just shut tight

Sailing all alone
I thought I'd made it home
But I threw it all away
Oh, where I've been sold and spun again
I'll be falling like a dream
Falling in between
I feel sick, I feel nervous
I know just what I did to deserve this
Though I know it's not a dream

Keeping quiet
Laying low
Holding on to what I don't want to know
'Till the daylight turns to ash and blows away
Missing keys
Bloody nose
Consequences of what I chose
Keep your eyes on me
Don't want my memory

Sailing all alone
I thought I'd made it home
But I threw it all away
Oh, where I've been sold and spun again
I'll be falling like a dream

I know just what I did to deserve this

Say goodbye to the cold

Will keep you warm when everything is getting colder

And kill the blinding lights of day to try again
Close my eyes and start descending

I, I can't seem to find a way back in time

That still keeps me awake
Still keeps me from everything we had
And I'm trying to get back

Stuck in this pattern, nevermore of sink or swim
But the oxygen is proving more than words could ever say

And the world stops turning

David Corey,"It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart.
Without saying a word you can light up the dark.
Try as I may I could never explain what I hear when you don't say a thing.
 
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me.
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall.
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all.
 
All day long I can hear people talking out loud, 
but when you hold me near you drown out the crowd.
Old Mister Webster could never define 
what's being said between your heart and mine.
 
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me.
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall.

Why do good times never last
Help me Jesus, show the way
I can`t hold on another day 

I was hungry, felling low,
I just couldn`t make out which way to go
Chasing rainbows that have no end,
The road is long without friend 

Be my friend, be my brother,
Be the piper, play the call
Across the seven seas of wonder
Be the guardian of my soul 

Just a young man looking homeward,
Watching the sun go down again
Across the water, the sun is shining,
But, will it ever, will it ever be the same 

Be my friend, be my brother,
Be the piper, play the call
Across the seven seas of wonder

You are the one who makes everything right,
Summer days and winter nights
Slowly, I open my eyes and your smile is there to greet me
And whisper words to tell me it's alright,
I'll stay by you in your darkest night

Time and again the situation shows,
You make it better
Time and again I realize,
You are the morning of my day
Time and again my feelings let me know
You make it better

We wasted words on conversation,
Cause all I wanna do is just talk about,
The woman I love, woman I love...
I never thought I could be this way,
When I hold you in my arms
I know I just wanna stay this is the place I should be,
In sweet harmony with the woman I love

You and I could always
Talk it over as friends
And you never, ever worried,
We always make it good in the end

Time and again the situation shows,
You make it better
Time and again I realize,
You are the morning of my day
Time and again my feelings let me know
You make it better

No wasted words on conversation,
A necessary separation
Cause all I wanna do is just talk about,
The woman I love, the woman I love",Time & Again
David Coverdale,"I lost my heart in a moment of madness
Took a chance on a romance with you
But you roll your dice as cold as ice
Lady luck´s got nothing on you

It´s too bad I´m all out of luck again
You deal your cards under the table
Never giving nothing away
You´re the black queen of hearts
Tearing me apart
Cheating on me night and day

It´s too bad I´m all out of luck again
Somebody throw me a life preserver
Cos´ I´m going down with a cry for love
A cry for love

I´m outta luck and you´re no lady
This game of love ain´t treating me right
So pour another shot, double what you got
Get me drunk as a skunk tonight

It´s too bad I´m all out of luck again
Somebody throw me a life preserver
Cos´ I´m going down with a cry for love

I can´t run, I can´t hide
Always on the losing side
Can´t you see me
Can´t you hear a cry for love
A cry for love, a cry for love

Somebody throw me a life preserver
Get me off shaky ground
Call off the dogs that hound me
Cos´ I´m going down with a cry for love
A cry for love, with a cry for love
Cry for love

Cry, cry, cry, cry for love...",Cry for Love
David Coverdale,"If you're tired of holding on
And you feel you can't go on
When it's all too much to bear
Call my name

If the sun refused to shine
And you're all used up from trying
When you can't hold back the tears
I'll be there

So don't you cry
Don't you cry
Wipe the tears from your yes
Forget about goodbyes
Ooh baby don't you cry

If you feel your love grow cold
When it chills your heart and soul
If you need a hand to hold
Think of me
And don't you cry
Don't you cry
Wipe the tears from your eyes
Forget about goodbyes
Ooh baby don't you cry

You're the reason I love
You're my heaven above
You're the reason I try
So dry the tears in your eyes
You're the reason I'm here
The reason I'm living for

So if you're tired of holding on
And you feel you can't go on

David Coverdale,"When I need a hand to guide me
I find you there
And everything you give to me
Is filled with love and care

You take away the memory
Of a thousand rainy days
With promises of summer love
You chase the clouds away
Now if the sky should fill with rain
I know the sun will shine again

When I think of all the hearthache
I´ve been through
The many mistakes I had to make
To lead me here to you

All the hurt and sadness
Don´t seem so much
As the walls I built around my heart
Crumble when we touch
Though my life was filled with pain
You show me how to love again

Now I´m never gonna run
Never gonna hide
I´m living on love
Never gonna run
Never gonna hide
I´m living on love
Nothing´s gonna stop me now
I´m living on love with you

So as you lay beside me
I´ll sing songs of love to you
'Cause everything I´m feeling babe
I know you feel it too
Nothing can come between us
No dark clouds in the way

All the love I feel for you
Grows stronger every day
After all is said and done

David Coverdale,"This is love. Love is blind
And true love is hard to find
It Makes you wonder now yesterdays news
At the bitter end of a love affair: some you win some you loose

'Cause love is blind
Love is blind

This is time To heal the pain
And sooner or later is back again
And don't be angry that your heart could be so wrong
When all of your many feelings got to sing the same old song

'Cause love is blind
Love is blind

Now Is time for parrying
For the nights Sleep alone
Makes you wonder why you ever learn from the past
'Cause this ain't the first time baby and it won't be the last

'Cause love is blind
Love is blind

love is blind
Love is blind

So is love, Love is blind
And true love, so hard to find
There is only one remedy to take away the pain
You gotta roll in the punches, baby, score all over again

'Cause love is blind
Love is blind

Love is blind, Love is blind, Love is blind, Love is blind
Love is blind, Love is blind, Love is blind, Love is blind
Love is blind, Love is blind, Love is blind, Love is blind
Love is blind, Love is blind, Love is blind, Love is blind

David Coverdale,"In the cold light of the morning
I watch the sunrise slowly dawning
I close my eyes and I see you there
And the silence takes my breath away

I can´t stand to face another day
In the evening when the sun goes down
I reach out for you but you´re not around
You color my world midnight blue
So what´s a man like me to do
With all the love I feel for you

Come and take me midnight blue
Here I am, I´m waiting for you
When I´m troubled and all alone
You shine down on me
When I need sympathy, sympathy

Under street lights I walk alone
Hiding in shadows from dusk to dawn
The taste of your perfume
On the cold night air
Leaves a sadness hanging over me
The thought of you won´t let me be

Come and take me midnight blue
Here I am, I´m waiting for you
When I´m troubled and all alone
You shine down on me
When I need sympathy, sympathy

Come and take me midnight blue
Here I am, I´m waiting for you
When I´m troubled and all alone
You shine down on me
When I need sympathy...",Midnight Blue
David Coverdale,"I was born by the river
Raised by the sea
Baptized in muddy water 
To drown the devil in me
I'm going back to the river
Down to the stream
I'm gonna follow that water
And find my dream

Where St. John be waiting on me
To wash my sins away
Hey St. Christopher pray for me
Cause baby I'm on my way

Where the rivers flow
Where the rivers flow
Just around the bend
I'll find my rainbows end 
Maybe then I'll know
Where the rivers flow

You know the gypsy woman told me
About a river of gold
Full of dreams for the asking
In the valley of souls
So I called to the captain
Come on take my hand
I'm gonna follow the water
To the Promised Land

Where St. John be waiting on me
To wash my sins away
Hey St. Christopher pray for me
Cause baby I'm on my way

Where the rivers flow
Where the rivers flow
Just around the bend
I'll find my rainbows end
And maybe then I'll know 
Where the rivers flow",River Song

David Coverdale,"I used to be the man for you
Did everything you wanted me to
So tell me baby
Where did I do wrong

I told you what you wanted to know
Precious secrets never spoken before
All I´m asking
Where did I go wrong

Some things are better left unsaid
But, all I do is cry instead
Now, I´ve cried me a river
Thinking how it used to be

There´ve been too many tears falling
And there´ve been too many hearts breaking in two
Remember what we had together
Believing it would last forever
So tell me baby
Where did I go wrong

More than I have ever given before
So won´t you tell me
Did I hurt you so bad

When my back´s against the wall
You cradle my uncertainty
And catch me when I fall

Like a circle around the sun
Touch me with your healing hands
And show my life has just begun

And when this time is over
When this life is through

David Crosby,"It's hard enough, I know
To find the strength to go
Back to where it all began
It's hard to enough to gain
Any traction in the rain
You know it's hard for me to understand 

Hard to find a way
To get through another city day
Without thinking about
Gettin' out 

Now the strangest thing I've seen
Was a t-shirt turning green
In envy of turtle dove
The dove's lady was the cause
Or maybe it was the olive branch she held in her claws
Or maybe he could see they were in love

To get through another city day

The men who really run this land
And I wonder why they run it

This afternoon and give
Them a piece of my mind
About peace for mankind

Yeah, but we had fun
She was gonna ride her bike to China
Sail away on a bottle top
And as the years passed by
One night I held her close to me
That was the first time I
Said I love you to Natalie
Carousel was crowded so we talked for a while
Natalie said ""Baby, you know I miss your smile
Whenever you go away from me""
You know that time starts tickin' when a love starts to fade
I knew something was wrong but still I thought we had it made
The first time I said I love you to Natalie
That was the first time I said I love you to Natalie

Now I look at her pictures and I talk to these walls
Call out her name but she don't hear me at all

And she got wild and restless
Tried everything she could take
One night I tried to stop her
But I was too late
That was the last time I said I love you to Natalie
And that was the last time I said I love you to Natalie

The hills or the valleys come near or come far
They say youth's a treasure we waste when we're young
So come down from the place where your medals are hung
You're forever returning and learning to fight
And you feel just like an old soldier tonight

Listen old soldier cause time doesn't wait
The moon's on your shoulder the hour is late
There's something there inside you still calls out to you
And you won't fade away whatever you do
You're forever beginning barely winning the fight
And you feel just like an old soldier tonight
You're not getting any younger that much is true now
But you've still got that hunger burning in you now
So what do you do now

What do you do now?
Listen old soldier to the sound in your ears
Of too many battles for too many years
There's only one thing you've learned in defeat
Losing is bitter and victory is sweet
You're always unraveling traveling light
And you feel just like an old soldier tonight
Feel just like an old soldier tonight, mmm",Old Soldier
David Crosby,"I used to walk around with my eyes on fire
My nerves real close to my skin
Had a fist full of questions and a brand on my cheek
And we would skate where the ice got thin

And the smoke blowing down from a cabin on a hilltop
Smoke blowing down in the street
Some kind of sweet smelling mystical backdrop
To the story unfolding at my feet

There's an edge to the twist of an acrobat in the air
There's an edge to the twist of a knife
There's a hard heart of darkness hovering there
Just around the corner from life

And I, I have no answers
I got no patented path to set you free
Besides I wouldn't know where you wanted to go

David Crosby,"You were dreaming on a park bench
About a broad highway somewhere
When the music from the carillon
Seemed to hurl your heart out there
Past the scientific darkness
Past the fireflies that float
To an angel bending down
To wrap you in her warmest cloak
And you ask ""What am I not doing?""
She says ""Your voice cannot command""
She says, ""In time you will move mountains
And it will come through your hands""

Still you angle for an option
Still you argue for your case
Like you wouldn't know a burning bush
Till it blew up in your face
We dream about the future
We memorize the past
When just a simple reaching out
Could build a bridge that lasts
And you ask ""What am I not doing?""
She says ""Your voice cannot command""
""In time you will move mountains
And it will come through your hands""

So whatever your hands find to do
You must do with all your heart
There are thoughts enough to blow men's minds
And tear great worlds apart
There's a healing touch to find you
Out on that broad highway somewhere
Gonna lift you as high as music
Running through an angel's hair
And don't worry what you are not doing
Cause your voice cannot command
And in time you will move mountains
And it will come through your hands
Through your hands
Through your hands
Mmm",Through Your Hands
David Crosby,"I recall my so called misspent youth
It seems more worthwhile every single day
Cruisin' Van Nuys and acting so uncouth
All the joys of runnin' away
There was no speed limit on the Nevada state line
The air was red wine on those top down nights
Just you and me my old roller-skate
And the common sense to know our rights
Sweet old racin' car of mine
Roarin' down that broken line
I never been so much alive
Too fast for comfort
Too low to fly
Too young to die

You say a man can't love a material thing
With aluminum skin and a cast iron soul
But they never heard your engine sing
Ah, there's peace in losing control
""Sticky fingers"" turned up real loud
Ah, we were flirtin' with catastrophe
We were doing everything that's not allowed
Life didn't come with a warranty for you and me
Sweet old racin' car of mine
Roarin' down that broken line
I never been so much alive
Too fast for comfort
Too low to fly
Too young to die

There is peace in losing control
When I die I don't want to go to Heaven
I just want to drive my beautiful machine
Up north on some Sonoma County road
With Jimmy Dean and Steve McQueen all the boys be singin', singin'
Sweet old racin' car of mine
Roarin' down that broken line
I never felt so much alive
Too fast for comfort
Is too low to fly
Too young to die
Just a little bit too young
Too young

He met her in a French cafe
She slipped in sideways like a cat
Sidelong glances what a wary little stray
She sticks in his mind like that
Saying ""Avez-vous une allumette?""
With her lips wrapped around a cigarette
Yvette in English saying ""Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss""
He's struggling with a foreign tongue
Reaching for words and drawing blanks
A loud mouth is stricken deaf and dumb
In a bistro on the left bank
""If I were a painter"" Picasso said
""I'd paint this girl from toe to head""
Yvette in English saying ""Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss""
Burgundy nocturne tips and spills
They move along nicely in the spreading stain
New chills new thrills for the old uphill battle
How did he wind up here again
Walking, talking, touched and scared
Uninsulated wires bared
Yvette in English going ""Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss"", mmm

[Instrumental (Acoustic Guitar)]

What blew her like a leaf this way
Up in the air and down to earth
First she flusters then she frays
So quick to question her own worth
Her cigarette burns her fingertips
It falls like fireworks she curses it
Sweetly in English she says ""Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss"", mmm ...
He sees her turn and walk away
Skittering like a cat on a stone
High heels clicking what a wary little stray
She leaves him by the seine alone
With black water and amber lights
A boney bridge between left and right

Little bit of instant bliss""

We were feeling very fine air was clear and slightly damp
We were riding back to have ourselves a party
To celebrate the robbing of the train

We were talking kind of low and lazy
About not having to go out soon again, oh yeah
You know we hadn't been back home two hours
We heard a hawk cry out in the night
And you know that's a signal from young Billy, who's our sentry

He's saying something here ain't exactly right, oh
So we quick grabbed some of our hardware
Stumbled out of our home
Two minutes flat we had found her an Indian girl all alone

And Eli said, ""Let's take her back to the cabin""
I said, ""You don't know she might be the law, yeah""
He said, smiling kind of nasty
""It ain't too damn likely she'll beat me to the draw"", Oh yeah

We were walking back through the darkness
I heard the Duke, he's our dynamiter, say
He said, ""What's your name, sweet little Indian girl?""
She said, ""Raven"" and she looked away
Right then I didn't trust her, no and I said so, oh no

Now, Eli, he's our fastest gunner
He's kind of mean and young from the South
He said, ""Fat Albert, you're getting kind of old and weird now""
You'd better get your twelve gauge or shut your mouth and ass now?
And I [Incomprehensible]

Now Eli and the Duke they got down to it
They each wanted the Indian girl for their own
But when they finally got around to asking her
You know she said, ?She'd come to take young Billy home?
Eli said, ?He'd kill young Billy he'd kill the Duke
And probably me too, yeah?, the Indian girl said, ""Go ahead now do it""
I said, ""Stop it"", and she bit my thumb nearly clean through

And when they finally started to break down the door
I smeared my face up with blood from my thumb, yeah
I laid down on the floor and played real good possum
You know I'm crazy but I ain't real dumb, oh no

Now I'm dying here in Albuquerque
I must be the sorriest sight you ever saw
You know the reason I'm the only man here to tell it
You know that Indian girl, she wasn't an Indian she was the law, oh

How can I sweep these words into a cluster
Put 'em in a pile like feathers on your floor?
Voyages and sea forests deep blue and rusty
Sew 'em in a satchel 'n leave 'em at your door
People's lives, people's whose lives
They fascinate me
All my life, all my life
I've wanted to understand
There's a man on the corner he's got the moon in his eyes
He just comes here to visit and he wears a disguise
And I wonder if he's looking for friends or for truth
I think he's calling for some in that telephone booth
And the smiling woman answers
She defeats fear with her eyes
She thinks life's fine so I think she's wise
And my heart wants to give her a gift so grand
That it will speak for me and tell her just where I stand
And I stand on a pillar and it's melting like ice
Of years that I've lived and some I've lived twice
And I have all these feathers and leaves on my floor
That I don't want just blowing around loose anymore
And I feel a need to gather to rummage and fetch
To shake out my life and give it a stretch
To bring shells to the surface, give 'em to you
Gifts from the sea floor rusty and blue
[Instrumental (Electric Guitar)]
Now these two lives hold my attention quite well
You see lives almost never run parallel
Like the boards in the flooring all deep grained and worn
Fated and fitted long before we were born

Take off your clothes and lie in the sun
Everybody says that music's for fun, yeah",Music Is Love

David Crosby,"[Instrumental (Electric Guitars)]
I wonder who they are
The men who really run this land
And I wonder why they run it
With such a thoughtless hand
What are their names
And on what streets do they live
I'd like to ride right over
This afternoon and give
Them a piece of my mind
About peace for mankind
Peace is not an awful lot to ask
[Instrumental Ending (Electric Guitars)]",What Are Their Names?
David Crosby,"Now some small parts seem right scattered here and there
One smiling face in a crowd that’s angry and scared
Can’t seem to see where it doesn’t get worse
It’s like one good thought getting lost in an angry verse

I try to write Buddha and it comes out guns
I vote for peace and the blood still runs
I want to believe I can pass happy to my child
But the truth gets lost and the system runs wild

Send me someone who has doubts about it
Who has conquered their own fear and lived to tell about it
Someone who won’t give up in the frozen rain
Who’ll walk right next to me through the orchards and the grain

I wake up from a dream of a baby and a blast
Scenes from the television in the blue light it cast
Seek peace in your own heart sounds true, sounds right
I’m a troubled soul searching for peace in the night

Send me someone who has doubts about it
Who has conquered their own fear and lived to tell about it
Someone who won’t give up in the frozen rain
Who’ll walk right next to me through the orchards and the grain

Trying to figure out how it all fits together
Humans and sun and oceans and weather
And even if I dream alone on such a dangerous night
Tryin’ to make all these pieces fit right

Send me someone who has doubts about it
Who has conquered their own fear and lived to tell about it
Someone who won’t give up in the frozen rain
Who’ll walk right next to me through the orchards and the grain

Even if I dream alone on such a dangerous night
Somehow I know I’m going to dream again tonight",Dangerous Night
David Crosby,"Find a heart that you can speak to
In the language of your own soul
In the stillness of the water
Find the peace to make you whole
A passage to illumination
Pulling light from the black of coal

Make it work like touching skin
Make it open so you can reach in
Make it breathe, make it sweat
Go as deep as you can get

In a whisper, in a shout
Say it how you want it said to you
In a voice so free of doubt
All your victories ringing true
Breath rising to the surface
Ascending slowly into the blue

Make it work like touching skin
Make it open so you can reach in
Make it breathe, make it sweat
Go as deep as you can get

Make it work like touching skin
In the eyes of a lover
In the words of a friend
All the goodness that lies within
Is lying just around the bend

And when you find this heart of yours
Keep it close enough to hear it’s cries
In the frame of open an open door
See the truth and strike the lies
Miles of stone to reach the core
A million answers in love’s disguise

Make it work like touching skin
Make it open so you can reach in
Make it breathe, make it sweat
Go as deep as you can get",Find a Heart
David Crosby,"After holding on to nothing for awhile
I glanced to see what waited there
A shadow leaning easy by a window
A scent of something recent in the air

Nothing runs faster than time at night
But time slows down every day
All those hours with nothing to do
Holding nothing again today

Sunny days can fool you
They can look wet with rain
And even words from a friend can bring back
The pain

Memories come back on their own
Birds fly south in the sky
Pictures are drawn pencil sketches at dawn
Wishes that I too could fly

Sunny days can fool you
They can look wet with rain
And even words from a friend can bring back
The pain

All the pictures I see are smiling at me
But today I’m somebody new
Not really knowing just coming and going
A stranger just passing through",Holding on to Nothing
David Crosby,"She grinds her hips
Maybe arches her back
There’s nobody there to see when she is doing that
The guy’s not there
He just doesn’t exist
She’s looking at empty space when she is doing this
She might walk home
She’s kind of tired
Or spend some of the money on a cab she’s hired

Below a bus groans by
And splashes a man
Who swears out a drunkard’s curse on the whole damned world
She smiles at that
And then starts to cry
She scrubs at a spot on her leg and then lets it dry

Then she’s sitting on the floor
With her head hung down
Listening to another language on TV
Unaware, hair unbound
Wondering where her mother and father might be
If she called, if she called

She dreams, she dreams
Don’t we all dream
A place, a way
A recurring theme

She remembers a time
When love was alive
Somehow it get’s lost in the sound of the city’s morning drive
Lost in the sound of the city’s roaring, morning drive",If She Called
David Crosby,"His open eyes
At first light
We see
An echo of his mothers smile

At her breast
His sister pressed
Outside
The sun begins to warm the ancient tile

They came that day, hollow men
Agents of a god they could not know
A mile above, distant eyes
Miss desperate pleas that pictures could not show
The morning falling

A shackle snaps
Beneath cold wings
Below
The shepherd is pulled toward home

The shadow falls
A falcon calls
Below
His world becomes a mountain of stone

They came that day, empty men
Agents of a god they’ll never know
High above, those eyes
See what seems to be on screens that glow
The morning falling

His eyes can see
But his mind can’t hold
What he has seen
The absence of the lives they used to live

A world away
The trigger is pulled
And here there is no reason to forgive",Morning Falling
David Crosby,"Just like in the movies a message
Comes through all the static and hiss
Pulling just enough words from the storm filled sky
To know that someone somewhere needs this

The radioman runs to the wheelhouse
Got that message held tight in his fist
An s.o.s off of the wireless
Saying someone somewhere needs this

For you to look out, look down
Reach your hand into the water
For you to look out, look down
And pull someone out of the sea

You are the captain, this is the ship
You will have to decide what gets done
Think about it when you’re on watch tonight
'Cause someday this message will come

For you to look out, look down
Reach your hand into the water
For you to look out, look down
And pull someone out of the sea

And your hands are slippery
The wind is strong
The boat is rocking
The world is storm
Your hands are slippery
You feel like turning away to run free
Your hands are so slippery
But you can pull someone out of the sea

For you to look out, look down
Reach your hand into the water
For you to look out, look down
And pull someone out of the sea

For you to look out, look down
Reach your hand into the water
For you to look out, look down
And pull someone out of the sea",Radio
David Crosby,"A slice of time
Curling, peeling
Back from the edge of the knife

Light fluttering
As if between two trains
Motordrive frames of life

Long blends of days
Stream into nights
Consciousness barely coping

The land going by seems level
But really the tracks are
Increasingly sloping

Images, images, images, images
Arranged against a blank wall
Images, images, images, images
Telling the truth to us all

Pluck out a day
A week or an hour
HOLD IT UP, HOLD IT UP TO THE LIGHT

Freeze the frame
Really look at the faces
With all of your sight

See the eyes
Looking at you
Immerse yourself into that minute

My teacher said time is elastic
I wonder just what
I’ll find in it

David Crosby,"People do so many things that make me mad but
Angry isn’t how I want to spend what time I have
Cognitive dissonance they call it
I wonder just how small it
Could be made to be in me

There so much disturbing short sighted shit
We must be able to do better than just live with it
I’m looking to find some peace within me to embrace
To encourage that smile to find my face
Sometimes I’m winning

Life in the city is so densely packed
Fear of each other is an accepted fact
Fear soaks into concrete just like grease
Fear is the antithesis of peace

“I have a dream,” a great man said
Another man came and shot him in the head
Yet the dream floats out there visible
Still alive, still alive

Those who rule the middle kingdom hate
The old man in the robes
They put up road blocks everywhere he goes
He says, “have no anger in your heart for them
They know not what they do”
Does that sound familiar
To you, to you

Life in the city is so densely packed
Fear of each other is an accepted fact
Fear soaks into concrete just like grease
Fear is the antithesis of peace

I was all night running, running, Lord, I wonder if you care
I had a run in, run around and run down
Run around the corner, corner, Lord, run smack in to a tree

I had to move, really had to move
That's why if you please, I am on my bendin' knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

Dressed myself in green, I went down unto the sea
Try to see what's goin' down, try to read between the lines
I had a feelin' I was fallin', fallin', fallin', I turned around to see
Heard a voice al callin', Lord, you was comin' after me

It's all night pourin', pourin', pourin', Lord, but not a drop on me
Test me, test me, test me, test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me? Throw me in to the jail house

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

With he things I cannot see
Is there madness in my being
Is it win that moves the trees

Sometimes you're further than the moon
Sometimes you're closer than my skin
And you surround me like a winter fog
You've come and burned me with a kiss

My heart burns for you

I carry pride like a disease

This probably the reason why the trying to sell economy

Every nigga from my hood tryina make 100 stacks plus
Looks like every nigga is born as actor, get wrapped up
All I wanna do is smoke a stoggy and get loaded
And go fuck with my old bitch and my new hoe got demoted
But once I'm with this dick, I don't know, she might just jump back on it
Got my dough hoe and my blow right off the coast of California

They ain't got no muscle, no hustle
No backbone, I stand alone
Not tripping, just saying, I'm different
Ain't hanging on the coattails of the next man
Passport in my left hand, thinking that you are next
Heck, hope you ain't holding your breath, man
Cause I'm out here, I'm hungry, I don't play around, trust me
Ain't hexed my drive since my Honda Civic got rusty
And my girl said she loved me, it's funny
Just thinking back, study hard for that 9 to 5
Like I thought that I'd be good with that
I was dreaming, still dreaming, spoil it on me like Willie Beaman
Still performing like Al Pachino, we stuck around in tuxedos
With my peoples, we growing up 'stead of seeing others slowing up
Tint squad, we throwing up, every time we showing up

Get it while I'm living
All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking
So I'm 'bout my business
And I'm running, I'm running
I'm running with you now
They don’t wanna give it up
We gon' make it out

And I'm running, I'm running
I'm running with them, yeah
They don't wanna give it up
We don't make them ask it

It don't get no greater, feel like I'm on fire
Feel like I'm Johnny Storm, feel like I'm volatile
Explosive, get close enough to notice
Your girl act out of character when she see me approaching
Ain't pouching I'm just saying it's nothing
You punching above your weight, I'm something
She ain't seen no substitute in that A team
That's B.A., Baracus, that BS, that whackness
Get no play in my axis, make 'em jump like AJ Hackett
Guarantee you in these boots they couldn't walk one mile
I really need to go and hang it up like a drunk dial
So behind the times they should probably rock a sundial
Shattering their dreams, I could make Big Pun smile
Music from the soul, don't need them to help me
If they fiending for the flash, they should take another selfie
Said I'm running, I'm running like Mo Farah so dapper
Swear the whole world could go against me, it don't matter, man

Get it while I'm living
All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking
So I'm 'bout my business

I'm on the chase
Won't wait another day
My plan is falling into place
We ain't got much to lose
I wanna taste
Won't wait another day
My plan is falling into place

See you got yourself a real cute doll you're living in style

If you don't want aggravation
Got a little job for you
This is what you gotta do, boy!

Lost from the start
Was the duel that was fought
To win a heart in Xanadu

Only shadows move in places where we used to go
And the buildings open to the sky
All echo with the vultures cry as if to show
Our love was for a day
And doomed to pass away

Were those clear eyes of yours ever filled with the pain and tears of grief?

The ocean pounds in fury
On a man who fights against it all alone
(Keep on Antoinette!)
She goes down with a sigh
And with her hear that cry
Antoinette! Antoinette!

Dawn breaks on the sea and the long dark night
Now gives way to the light and no trace remains

Far away from the girl who still waits by the shore
Does she know her love is buried in the wreck

No me llores mÃ¡s preciosa mia
TÃº no me llores mÃ¡s que el tiempo se agota entre lagrimas rotas por la soledad

No abran rincones pa las dudas
ni abra en tus noches oscuridad
no abrÃ¡ reflejos ni amargura
juntitos volveremos a soÃ±ar

tocando palmas...

caricias de espuma,

que se lleva tan dentro,
pasion why ternura,
en las dunas de este amor...
solo Dios te imagino...
Por las calles de tu cuerpo,
entre marismas de agua why sal,
voy contando tus lunares,
que alumbran mi despertar...
why si hay viento de poniente,
que no borre nuestro amor,
se me olvidan los pesares,
cuando yo siento tu calor...

al borde dela duda why la traiciÃ³n...
why escribo frases sin palabras,
que no puedo ocultar,
que arrancan los silencios de mi voz...

Sin conocerla
Siempre acompañada de un libro
Que lee sentada al sol,

Tú vas, y yo vengo camino lento
Tú tienes, yo tengo así es mi cuento
Somos la lluvia, somos la tierra
Somos la solución del dilema

Tú vas, y yo vengo camino incierto
Si tengo, te ofrezco ese es mi credo
Somos ocupas en esta tierra
Como en aquellos sueños, lo veo

Siente la marea

Despertar caminar
Y sentir mis pies sobre la arena

Bailarás bailaré
Respirar aire porque yo estoy mejor así
Mejor por dentro, sin mirar atrás

Soy libre como el agua
Que se derrama entre mis dedos
Como un grito me abro paso en el silencio

Parece que mis alas blancas pierden el miedo
Al antojo de la vida se me antoja a mi manera

Tú vas, y yo vengo. Camino lento
Tú tienes, yo tengo. Así es mi cuento
Somos la lluvia, somos la tierra
Como en aquellos sueños, me elevo

Siento la marea, siente la marea

Despertar caminar
Y sentir mis pies sobre la arena

Bailarás bailaré
Respirar aire porque yo estoy mejor así

Dame un sol que alumbre mis mañanas
Dame olor a ropa limpia
Dame tus manos sabias

Despertar caminar
Y sentir mis pies sobre la arena

Bailarás bailaré

Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks-ahh!

One sure shot way to get em outta them pants

David Dover,"Ah one two three four, one two three four
At sixteen she quit high school
To make a fortune in the promised land
She got a job behind the counter
In an all-night hamburger stand

She wrote faithfully home to Mama
Now Mama don't you worry none
From small things Mama, big things one day come

It was late one Friday
He pulled in outta the dark
He was tall and handsome
First she took his order, then she took his heart

They bought a house on the hillside
Where little feet soon would rock
Well from small things Mama, big things one day come

Oh, but love is fleeting
It's sad but true
When your heart is bleeding
You don't want to hear the news

She packed her bags
And with a Wyoming County Real Estate man
She went down to Tampa
In an Eldorado Grand

She wrote back dear mama
Life is just heaven in the sun
From small things Mama, big things one day come

Well, she shot him dead on a sunny Florida road
And when they caught her all she said
Was she couldn't stand the way he drove

Back home, dear Johnny prays for his Betty's parole
He waits high on the hillside where the lonely waters roll
At his feet and almost grown now
Blue eyed daughter and a handsome son

Without a love of my own

You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for

The only one my arms will ever hold

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet

With those blues on parade

Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain

Down past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells

As I walked on

Of juniper and lamplight

Instead of help we were given a crowd

Wandering over the hills unseen or is it a dream

Air

Oh into the dark

David Essex,"Everything has its season 
Everything has its time
Show me a reason
And I'll soon show you a rhyme

Cats sit on the window sill
Children sit in the show
Why do I feel I don't fit in
Anywhere I go

Rivers belong where they can ramble
Eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner, of the sky

Every man his daydreams 
Every man has his goal
People like the way dreams have of 
Sticking to the soul

Rain comes after thunder
Winter comes after fall
Sometimes I think I'm not after
Anything at all

So many men seem destined
To settle for something small
But I, I won't rest
'Til I know I have it all
So don't ask where I'm going
Just listen when I'm gone
Far away you'll hear me singing
Softly to the dawn

Oh, rivers belong where they can ramble, 
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free, yeah
Gotta find my corner, ooh of the sky, yeah (of the sky, yeah)
Rivers belong where they can ramble
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly (high)

Gotta find my corner, yes I do

Gotta find my corner of the sky, sky

David Essex,"Sing you fools! But you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through

Show business kept us all alive
Since 17 October 1945
But the star has gone, the glamour's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in
Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of ideas a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much but she said it loud
And who am I who dares to keep
His head held high while millions weep?
Why the exception to the rule?
Opportunist? Traitor? Fool?
Or just a man who grew and saw
From seventeen to twenty-four
His country bled, crucified?

You have no right to speak to me so kind

I drove 300 miles from the place I call home

I wear my cynicism like a tattoo
And while poets try to engineer definitions of love
You know all I can think of is you

And I cant wait to see you on Sunday
Far from the traffic and the smoke and the noise
For this evening I will play back every message that you sent
So I can sleep to the sound of your voice

Now I don't like to use words like 'forever'
But I will love you till the end of today
And in the morning when I remember everything that you are
I know ill fall for you over again

I know someday this all will be over
And it's hard to say what most will I miss
Just give me one way to spend my last moments alive

It doesn't mean a thing.
So why don't you just tell me

I don't care what you call me

I know I let you down,
And Christ, you let me know
Every time
And time again.

Just another afternoon
Get drunk and disappear
So call me what you will

Rain it on down.
What else can you throw at me
I haven't heard before?

And tear me on down.
I am unforgivable.
So why don't you just tell me
What you really think of me?

And scream me on down
I am so forgettable
Yes, I know.

And shoot me on down

Will you listen to their bleeding hearts?

And so we glanced our watches and join in as everybody sings,
Oh what have we become?
Will you hop a train to anywhere?
It sure ain't no place like home,
Where there are no strangers,
Only people you don't wanna know,

Well that was a long time ago.

Your fault or mine,
It's such a tough one to call,
Do you one day look up to see your innocence fall,
From a twelve story window, to the concrete below,
It was all such a long time ago.

Now your path and mine,
They never seem to converge,
And now sat here in god-knows-where with a mouthful of words,
Well they just sound like noises,
If you say them enough,
It was all such a long time ago.

Now was it though?

In some underground saloon,
Where you can always get a drink,
There's a girl by the cigarette machine,
And I think I'll strike up a conversation,
But I wouldn't know how,
Doesn't seem such a good idea now

With the clouds on the moon,
Another Hollywood sky,
It's time I dragged myself home and to wonder just why,
I still think of you know,

Foot down for the alienation
Look on as your love, its gets lost in translation
To a language that nobody understands
There are smiles as they erode and corrupt you
Of the great expectations you could never live up to
We are lost, we are lost, we are lost
Get you coat, 'cause the righteous are leaving
Cause they can't work out what the hell to believe in
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame
No abandon, no heartfelt desire
No love could be worth getting fired
For real, it's surreal, it's so real
So paint over the cracks and then cover
What you thought was the worst ever pain with another
And the first one, it always comes free
How they love you so cold and so vicious
With friends like these, well who needs politicians
The first one, its always comes free
They tell you heroin takes like ice cream
Clever men know all that and all this
And they will talk and they talk and the don't fucking listen
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame
It's no life but God, it's a living
Come on Jesus Christ, come back all is forgiven
We are lost, we are lost, we are lost
Have no fear of the state of the nation
Let the facts have no bearing on public relations
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame
What a model of Christian behavior
Preach on with the message of ""go fuck thy neighbor""
It's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame
It's a shame, it's a shame
Watch your step by the crowd of fanatics
While they kill in the name of applied mathematics
Hate the system even though you invented it
Go kill your brothers and claim self defense of it
Picking up all the secrets and tricks to being

Take you seats for the final calamity
Don't you look serious, hell, what can the matter be?

With all we would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had 
Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared this affair 
Would lead our love into
Somethin' happened along the way
Yesterday  was all we had
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be was all we had

Oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

Oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found
Oh, oh, after the love has gone

David Foster,"Tonight it's very clear, as we're both standing here,
there's so many things I want to say
I will always love you, I will never leave you alone.

Sometimes I just forget, say things I might regret,
it breaks my heart to see you crying.
I don't want to lose you,
I could never make it alone.

I am a man who would fight for your honor,
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of.
We'll live forever,knowing together
that we did it all for the glory of love.

You keep me standing tall, you help me through it all,
I'm always strong when you're beside me.
I have always needed you,
I could never make it alone.

I am a man who would fight for your honor,
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of.
We'll live forever,knowing together
that we did it all for the glory of love.

Just like a knight in shining armor,
from a long time ago.
Just in time I will save the day,
take you to my castle far away.

I am a man who would fight for your honor,
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of.
We'll live forever,knowing together
that we did it all for the glory of love.

We'll live forever, knowing together
that we did it all for the glory  of love.",Glory of Love
David Foster,"Growin' up you don't see the writing on the wall.
Passin' by, movin' straight ahead you knew it all.
But maybe sometime if you feel the pain,
you'll find you're all alone; everything has changed.

Play the game; you know you can't quit until it's won.
Soldier of only you can do what must be done.
You know, in some ways you're a lot like me.
You're just a prisoner, and you're tryin' to break free.

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky.
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher.
Gonna be your man in motion.
All I need is a pair of wheels.
Take me where the future's lying: St. Elmo's fire.

Burning up; don't know just how far that I can go.
Soon be home; only just a few miles down the road.
And I can make it, I know I can.
You broke the boy in me, but you won't break the man.

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky.
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher.
Gonna be your man in motion.
All I need is a pair of wheels.
Take me where the future's lying: St. Elmo's fire.

I can climb the highest mountain, cross the widest sea.
I can feel St. Elmo's fire burning in me, burning in me.
Just once in his life a man has his time.
And my time is now; I'm comin' alive.

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky.
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher.
Gonna be your man in motion.
All I need is a pair of wheels.
Take me where the future's lying: St. Elmo's fire.

I can hear the music playin'; I can see the banners fly.
Feel like a vet again.  I hope I ain't high!
Gonna be your man in motion; all I need is a pair of wheels.",St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)
David Foster,"Lonely fear lights up the sky
Can't help but wonder why
You're so far away

There, you had to take a stand
In someone else's land
Life can be so strange

I wish we never had to chose
To either win or lose
That we could find a way

But I won't turn my back again
Your honor I'll defend
So hurry home, till then

[Chorus:]
Stand tall; stand proud!
Voices that care are crying out loud
And when you close your eyes tonight
Feel in your heart how our love burns bright

I'm not here to justify the cause
Or to count up all the loss
That's all been done before

I just can't let you feel alone
When there's so much love at home
We're sending out to you

All the courage that you've known
The bravery you've shown
Clearly lights the way

We pray, to make the future bright
To make the wrong things right
(Rap: Right or wrong, we're all praying you'll remain strong
That's why we're all here and singing along)

[Chorus:]

And when you close your eyes tonight
Feel in your heart how our love burns bright

You are the voice
You are the light

[Chorus:]

You are the voice and the guiding light
Feel in your heart how our love burns bright",Voices That Care
David Foster,"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree-tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

Loving you is some kind of wonderful
Because you show me just how much you care
You've given me the thrill of a lifetime
And made me believe you've got more thrills to spare, oh
This will be an everlasting love, oh yes it will now
You've brought a lot of sunshine into my life
You've filled me with happiness I never knew
You gave me more joy than I ever dreamed of
And no one, no one can take the place of you, ooh
This will be, you and me, yes-sir-ee, eternally
Hugging and squeezing and kissing and pleasing
Together, forever, through rain or whatever

David Foster,"When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world
For a good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

When a man loves a woman
I give you everything I've got (yeah)
Trying to hold on
To your precious love
Baby please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see

Yes when a man loves a woman
I now exactly how he feels
'Cause baby, baby, baby
I am a man
When a man loves a woman",Caruso
David Foster,"In a church, by the face
He talks about the people going under

Only child know

A man decides after seventy years
That what he goes there for, is to unlock the door
While those around him criticize and sleep
And through a fractal on a breaking wall
I see you my friend, and touch your face again
Miracles will happen as we trip

But we're never gonna survive, unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive, unless
We are a little crazy

Crazy yellow people walking through my head
One of them's got a gun, to shoot the other one
And yet together they were friends at school
Ohh, get it, get it, get it, get it no no

If all were there when we first took the pill
Then maybe, then maybe, then maybe, then maybe
Miracles will happen as we speak

But we're never gonna survive unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive unless

Climbed aboard the dream weaver train
Driver take away my worries of today
And leave tomorrow behind

Oh dream weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Oh dream weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light

Fly me high through the starry skies
Maybe to an astral plane
Cross the highways of fantasy
Help me to forget today's pain

Oh dream weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Oh dream weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light

Though the dawn may be coming soon
There still may be some time
Fly me away to the bright side of the moon
And meet me on the other side

I believe you can get me through the night

David Foster,"I found that love provides the key
Unlocks the heart and souls of you and me
Love will learn to sing your song
Love is written in the stone

Every man, I meet is walking time
Free to wander, past his conscious mind
Love will come and take you home
Love is written in the stone

Do you believe, my friend, in what you claim
People of the world, all doubt the same
Bringing questions of their own
Truth is written in the stone

In the stone, you'll find the meaning
You're not standing tall
In the stone the light is shining
Ever touching all

Life experience a passing day
Time will witness, what the ole folks say
Getting stronger every day
Strength is written in the stone

Deep inside your hearts for you to keep
Lies a spark of light that never sleeps
The greatest love you've ever known
Yeah is written in the stone

David Foster,"Now, while we're here alone
And all is said and done
Now I can let you know
Because of all you've shown
I've grown enough to tell you
You'll always be inside of me

How many roads have gone by
So many words left unspoken
I needed to be by your side
If only to hold you

Forever in my heart
Forever we will be
And even when I'm gone
You'll be here in me
Forever

Once, I dreamed that you were gone
I cried out trying to find you
I begged the dream to fade away
And please awaken me
But night took a hold of my heart
And left me with no one to follow
the love that I lost to the dark
I'll always remember

Forever in my heart
Forever we will be
And know that when I'm gone
You'll be here in me
Forever in my heart
You always thought I'd be
I'd be yours
