I'm not a hero or even someone who does good

",I'm Just Your Man
Graham Parker,"The dreams and hopes of men 
Are powered by addiction
And who am I to say that 
This is an affliction
When everybody gets
Suckered in and lives their
Lives like fiction
Writing their own story
Of success

They say they want you 
For your colourful evocation
The way you turn a cliche
Into a sensation
But all they ever wanted 
Was that same vibration
The one that shimmers 
Around success

[Chorus]
Success success
Success success success
Success success success
All you ever need success

You can't be happy while
Someone else has a fistful
They glow from TV screens
Healthy strong and fiscal
And everybody slaps their 
Back while you're alone 
With a wristful
Jerking to the rhythm 
Of success

[Chorus]",Success

I'll walk one more mile with you 'cause you're my friend

The sun is gonna shine again

Someday we will ride a train that only seats one class
To a destination that feels like home at last, oh I
Know it seems impossible now, I know it seems like a joke
But if there's no purpose, if there's no love
We hang at the end of a rope

I have had my mind made up and I have been in doubt
But sometimes even I can see the light that - that will not be put out
And every man will hold up his head and know it won't get beaten back down
And every woman will be not afraid to walk on the very same road

And the sun is gonna shine again we'll make it around that bend

The camera rolled and my life flashed before me just as if in a dream
A dog was leading me round on a chain ten girls ago
I kicked it but I ended up in pain

Sweet pain of a needle's sting ten girls ago

And now I stand a hope in hell
Of not ending up in the bottom of a well

Graham Parker,"As you wash your hair and bathe in Perrier 
As you hit the bank machine at night
Drinking money for tomorrow's flight
As you count your loss or bet on a black horse
Sit behind the wheel of a black Porsche 
Use your leather organizer with your name embossed 
The night is thick with frost It chills your heart

You got the world right where you want it 
Where do you want where do you want the world? 
You got the girl right where you want her 
But where do you want where do you want the girl?
 
I pulled up at your door And turned the key once more 
Took a calculator from my pocket 
Checked a picture of us in a locket 
I knew you were not in An alarm began to ring 
Punched a number on a cordless phone 
Made an offer on a Docklands condominium home 
Somewhere with no soul That won't remind me
 
You got the world right where you want it 
Where do you want where do you want the world? 
You got the girl right where you want her

She's not disposed to being one of a dozen she's
A living thing that's bound to get tired
She won't be content just being admired funny that's the way it goes
When you're like a long stem rose

My long stem rose were you cut down in your prime
My love still grows for the flower I call mine
Are you doomed to die after the spring time
Have I just become a thorn in your side
Funny that's the way it goes when you love a long stem rose

Strings over verse

My long stem rose I know you won't last too long
You'll shed your clothes your petals fall then you're gone
In another garden growing so sweetly in an endless summer
Forgetting about mewonder where you are who knows
In another bed I suppose, lying like a long stem rose

The company is crippling me
the worst trying to ruin the best, the best

The boys and me are getting real well known around town
But every time we try to spread the action
Someone always brings it down, down
I ate the orange and I don't feel well
For them it's inconvenience for me it's hell

They couldn't sell kebabs to the Greeks, the geeks

Is this a Russian conspiracy, no it's just idiocy
Is this a Chinese burn

It's got a small brain and refuses to learn

Graham Parker,"Stuff comes down from the golden triangle
On ferries from Denmark to Helsingborg
The band strikes up but they're out of time
On synthesiser and washboard
Wooden tulips grow by the roadside
Made in a factory in Jonjoping
Fake glass baubles hang in the station
Just like the passenger's imitation
Then it hits you she was just the dregs
All you wanna do now is break her legs
Kick that brunette into a pond
Replace her with a...

[Chorus]
Platinum blonde  
Platinum blonde

There's a secret world that you cannot enter
It's in the center of the darkest night 
She's waiting there with a set of works
And a Swedish passport and something white
She walks past but you can't form a whistle
Even her lips look artificial
You wanna follow her but you can't swallow
Her act, it seems so superficial 
Now you've shed the old one like a worn out shoe
It was all your fault but you blame her too
You know its phony but at least it's new
And it comes from a bottle like

[Chorus]

And in your heart there's a new addiction
Another friction that you can't resolve 
She seemed alive but she is just a cipher
An imaginary postcard that just dissolved
Endless sunsets glow in the distance
Painted by Picasso's assistants
Perfect people travel in Volvos
Into the sunsets into the distance
You're just a passenger she's not a ticket
A foreign stamp you've got to lick it 
Put it in the mail box
Put it in the fail box
You never seem to learn from the school of hard knocks
Then she walks past and laughs at the pond
You can't break a heart that doesn't respond, like

Production line like a car,
Till everything you put on is a put-on, and you don't know who's face

Could be anyone you're sending out there tonight, is it any wonder all of
The lights are too bright?
And you need temporary beauty, and pray to God that it doesn't rain
You need temporary beauty, even though it might be love in vain
The world is full of little people like you, they have to read a book to
Learn what to do
They hang around in second -hand[?] clothes, and every kind of pressure
Steps on their toes
Love doesn't fall out of a magazine, you mustn't always believe what you've seen
And you need temporary beauty, and pray to God that it doesn't rain
You need temporary beauty, even though it might be love in vain
Ah-ah temporary beauty, ah-ah temporary beauty, ah-ah temporary beauty
You might be the sweetest little girl in your heart,
But still the world [?] knows that and tears you apart
You think of the parties you'll never attend, you dream of someone who's
More than a friend
Love doesn't jump out of a magazine, you mustn't always believe what you've seen
And you need temporary beauty, and pray to God that it doesn't rain

Might be love,

Take off their muzzles and check out the view
The gypsy boys seem such colourful characters

Signs on her back that say Keep on the grass 
Powerful liquor in a hip flask 
Coins from the commonwealth Doubloons from the sea 
A knife in her boot heel A Bonsai tree 
Ice cream in her pocket Diamonds from her fence 
It all works like clockwork It all makes sense

That's what she is
 
With her clouded leopard on a leash in the shed 
A vicious black rodent she calls Fred 
She keeps her diary under the bed

Walkin' round London with foreign banknotes 
throwin' silver nunchucks at cab drivers throats

Go peddle it under the street lights

No you just have to wait,

It's a game of give and take.
You can't hurry love,
No, you just have to wait,
You gotta trust, give it time,

Before I find a love to let me live again.

When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone,

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,

Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone.

For some tender arms to hold me tight.

To be leaned against too long

Her comb still lies beside my bed

It just doesn't know she's gone
Ooh, but I remember everything she said

Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes
Warm evenings, pale mornings, bottle of blues
And the tiny golden pins that she wore up in her hair

Gram Parsons,"In my hour of darkness, in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speed
Once I knew a young man went driving through the night
Miles and miles without a word but just his high beam lights
Who'd have ever thought they'd build such a deadly Denver bend
To be so strong, to take so long as it would till the end

In my hour of darkness, in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speed

Another young man safely, strummed his silver stringed guitar
And He played to people everywhere some say he was a star
But he was just a country boy, his simple songs confess
And the music he had in him so very few possess
In my hour of darkness, in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speed

The there was an old man kind and wise with age
And he read me just like a book never missed a page
And loved him like a father, and I loved him like my friend
And I knew his time could shortly come but I did not know just when
In my hour of darkness in my time of need

Gram Parsons,"Won't you scratch my itch sweet Annie Rich
And welcome me back to town
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlour
And I'll show you how it all went down
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh and I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you

'Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with those waves of grain
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee

We flew straight across that river bridge, last night half past two
The switch-man wave his lantern goodbye and good day as we went roling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do (pick for me James)

And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something that I've never been shown
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue see
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee

The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
And lighted out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh but I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you",Return of the Grievous Angel

Gram Parsons,"Was one thousand dollars wedding, supposed to be held the other day
And with all the invitations sent
The young bride went away
When the groom saw people passing notes

Not unusual, he might say
But where are the flowers for my baby
I'd even like to see her mean old mama
And why ain't there a funeral, if you're gonna act that way

I hate to tell you how he acted when the news arrived
He took some friends out drinking and it's lucky they survived
'Cause he told them everything there was to tell there along the way
And he felt so bad when he saw the traces of old lies still on their faces

So why don't someone here just spike his drink
Why don't you do him in some old way
Supposed to be a funeral
It's been a bad, bad day

The Reverend Dr. William Grace
Was talking to the crowd
All about the sweet child's holy face and
The saints who sung out loud

And he swore the fiercest beasts
Could all be put to sleep the same silly way
And where are the flowers for the girl
She only knew she loved the world

And why ain't there one lonely horn and one sad note to play
Supposed to be a funeral
It's been a bad, bad day
Supposed to be a funeral

It's been a bad, bad day",$1000 Wedding
Gram Parsons,"Got in a little  trouble at the county seat
Lawd, they put me in the jail house for loafing on the street
When the judge heard the verdict I was a guilty man
He said forty-five dollars or thirty days in the can
Said, that'll be cash on the barrelhead, son
You can take your choice you're twenty-one
No money down, no credit plan
No time to chase you cause I'm a busy man

Found a telephone number on a laundry slip
I had a good hearted jailer with a six gun hip
He let me call long distance, she said number please
And no sooner than I told her, she shouted out at me

That'll be cash on the barrelhead son
Not part not half but the entire sum
No money down, no credit plan
Cause a little bird told me, you're a travellin' man

Thirty days in the jailhouse, four days on the road
I was feeling mighty hungry my feet a heavy load
Saw a greyhound coming stuck up my thumb
Just as I was being seated, the driving caught my arm

Said that'll be cash on the barrelhead son
This old gray dog gets paid to run
When the engine starts, lawd, the wheels won't roll
Give me cash on the barrelhead I'll take you down the road",Cash on the Barrelhead
Gram Parsons,"Hearts on fire
My love for you brought only misery
Hearts on fire
Put out the flames and set this cold heart free
One short year our love burned
Until at last I guess you learned
The art of being untrue and then goodbye
What could I do except to cry and moan
Lord, what have I done?

Once we were as sweet and warm as the golden morning sun
Hearts on fire
My love for you brought only misery
Hearts on fire
Put out the flames and set this cold heart free

Friends say it's just a game
And that no one is to blame
Go out forget her lies
But she'll be there and sparks will fly
My love has turned to hatred
Sleep escapes me still
God, please take this heart of mine

Gram Parsons,"In South Carolina there are many tall pines
I remember the oak tree that we used to climb
But now when I'm lonesome, I always pretend
That I'm getting the feel of hickory wind

I started out younger at most everything
All the riches and pleasures, what else could life bring?
But it makes me feel better each time it begins
Callin' me home, hickory wind

It's hard way to find out that trouble is real
In a far away city, with a far away feel
But it makes me feel better each time it begins
Callin' me home, hickory wind

Keeps callin' me home, hickory wind",Hickory Wind
Gram Parsons,"Darling, there is something I must tell you, you must know
But it's so hard to say the words I feel
This fancy that I'm on has been going on too long
It's time we stopped pretending things are real

'Cause I've been living deep in sin
I've been living blind
And I don't know just what's right or wrong
To take a chance on losing you was such a silly thing to do
The chance I might wake up and find you gone

Blue, so blue, my love is burning blue
Any brighter flame would be a lie
Blue, so blue, my love still burns for you
But I know that I'll only make you cry

A thief can only steal from you
He cannot break your heart
He'll never touch the precious things inside
So one like you should surely be miles and miles away from me
Then you'd never care how much I've lied

So try to understand the pain
It takes so long when I explain
Please, don't you forget how much I've lied",How Much I've Lied
Gram Parsons,"Love hurts, love scars, love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud holds a lot of rain.
Love hurts uh, uh love hurts.

I'm young, I know but even so
I know a thing or two I've learned from you
I've really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a stove burns you when it's hot
Love hurts uh, uh love hurts.

Some fools rave of happiness
Blissfullness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess,
But they're not fooling me
I know it isn't true, no it isn't true
Love is just a lie, made to make you blue
Love hurts uh, uh love hurts.",Love Hurts
Gram Parsons,"Oh,
Well, I was born in a little bitty tar hut
And they called me a man 'cause I couldn't
Keep my big, big mouth shut
So what's the sense of me sitting here leaving
When any ole day I might be even
And Lord knows that New York City's got
A lot to do with it
I wish someday I could find the way
To get it out of my grain
This dirty old town's gonna sink right down
And I don't want to go with it
Well I wish there was a way that
I knew to get even
A way to get a lick in
A bobbin' and a weavin'
Any ole thing besides goin' and a leavin'

He would have made it three but he took
A lot of bad advice

And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

She said the prettiest place on earth was Baltimore at night
Well a man feels proud to give his woman what she's longing for
And I kind of like the streets of Baltimore

Then I got myself a factory job, I ran an old machine
And I bought a little cottage in a neighborhood serene
And every night when I'd come home with every muscle sore
She'd drag me through the streets of Baltimore

Well I did my best to bring her back to what she used to be

Watched and checked on every single day
Building his own special cars

Ooh, the new soft shoe

And then walking through a southern road
I saw a shoeshine stand
A man was talking to a crowd
Holding slippers in his hands
Don't you know the same thing happens
Each and every day
Did you ever hear a song
That's hard to even play

Ooh, the new soft shoe
Ooh, the new soft shoe

Then a color TV broadcast
Snuck in from New Orleans
Showed me one more man who spoke

But she don't give a darn about me
to make her love me I tried,

But she just refused 
And ever since she's gone away,
I've got those lovesick blues
 
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,"" 
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone 
I'm yearning for it yet 
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy"" 
Twas just a beautiful dream
 
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart  it seems
I got so used to her somehow
But I'm no body's baby 
Now, gee it's awful when you're lonesome 
and get those lovesick blue-oo-oo-oo-oo's

",Lovesick Blues
Gram Parsons,"Love hurts love scars love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud holds a lot of rain.
Love Hurts uh, uh Love Hurts.

I'm young I know but even so
I know a thing or two I've learned from you
I've really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a stove burns you when it's hot
Love Hurts Uh, Uh Love hurts.

Some fools rave of happiness 
Blissfullness togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess, 
But they're not fooling me
I know it isn't true, no it isn't true
Love is just a lie, made to make you blue
Love hurts Uh, uh love hurts.",Love Hurts [*]
Gram Parsons,"This old town is filled with sin 
It will swallow you in 
If you've got some money to burn 
Take it home right away 
You've got three years to pay 
But Satan is waiting his turn 
The scientists say 
It will all wash away 
But we don't believe any more 
Cause we've got our recruits 
And our green mohair suits 
So please show your I.D. At the door 
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house 
It seems like this whole town's insane 
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door 
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain 

A friend came around 
Tried to clean up this town 
His ideas made some people mad 
But he trusted his crowd 
So he spoke right out loud

hiding in shadows where we don't belong
living in darkness, to hide alone
You and me, at the dark end of the street

I know a time has gonna take it's toll
we have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
Oh, our love keeps going on strong

You and me
They gonna find us, they gonna find us
They gonna find us love someday

",Dark End of the Street
Gram Parsons,"There's a place everyone of us can go to
Maybe you have been there once or twice
Where all your friends just look at you and whisper
They want to give you nothing but advice
When you walk in they all know what you're after
And the higher that you get the more they'll see
In a dark room filled with music, wine and laughter
Your eyes keep searching for her constantly
Is it that one in the corner with her eyes filled with tears
Or is she the one who's having fun drinking too much beer
Every night it's the same sad old procedure
The doorman winks at you on your way out
'Cause deep inside he knows you'll be returning
And he's got something you can't live without
There's nothing new that can be said about dirt
And there's nothing left inside your heart but the same old hurt
Of an old love's fancy life that left you stranded in a dream
Ain't you glad you're a high fashion queen
Ain't you glad you're a high fashion queen

And I don't think it's gonna go on

And you want me home all night
And you don't want another fight
But you better love

Her melody was soft
Her words spoke of a sinking ship
Which no one could get off

Her face began to blur
I turned to face the future
And the last thing that I heard

All my yesterdays,
Killed my past

The ocean screams to me

I've fallen in
Or did I jump headfirst

I know when I call out your name
My soul you save

One day I decided I would think on this,
I wish sometimes that I would not be who I am

not knowing if faith and pain could co-exist:
Could I ever on my own conceive
Of someone I did not know, but I need?
I must be made to be at peace and communion

'cause there must be some place somehow from where I have fallen
Chorus
I find through every ounce of pain I feel
That my mind cannot deny that God is real
Leaves me in conclusion that I know the way

the inconsistency of what I say I should be
Compared to what I am in actuallity
Though I am unable to always obey

my soul's hunger for a deeper life
Nothing in this world has satisfied
The weight of my misdeeds were crushing, blinding me
I still live with pain inside but now I see

The peices of my life are scattered on the floor
I stared at them till I could take no more

Would I not be dead inside but I live instead

Mothers weep, children sleep
So much violence ends in silence
It's a shame there's no one 2 blame
For all the pain that life brings
If u will just take me It might just complete me
And together we can make a stand

U will love me, I will love u

Gran Torino,"Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid

No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes i couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep
But still i had to keep on going

Never knowing if i could take it
If i would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and i prayed
And now i've found my way

[Chorus]
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
(make it happen)
And if you get down on your
Knees at night
And pray to the lord
He's gonna make it happen
(make it happen)

I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong
Baby just hold on

You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do
Still i have to keep going

Never knowing if i could take it
If i would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and i prayed
And now i've finally found my way

I once was lost
But now i'm found

When it's phenomenal, you fiend to know who produced it 
Phrases frequently heard regarding new music 
Who's the kid rhymin? Where he from, who's the label? 
Now's a bad time to approach the turntables 
Try again next millennium or some other bag 
But when they jock a disc jock, it's another smash 
I just hit em wit it a minute ago 
On some exlusive promo to spin at the show 
Twenty-five hundred heads waitin on Black Star 
When J-Rocc throw your record on, you feel like Allah 
Visions of my image on the stage that I'm lookin at 
From the balcony to down front, I coulda took em back 
Every ear spectatin inside the palace 
Hype 'cause my likeness just might bless the stylus 
But that was when I was the limelight addict 
Nowadays, gettin music added is my habit 
The kind you wait on to debate on, or hate on 
Ever since the ad wit the street date on 
And now the future can't come quick enough 
Promotional bandits out stickin mad stickers up 
They got graffiti ? all city 
The anticipation keep clerks at Fat Beats way busy 
Long for the day of reckoning 
We make it so that when the album drop 
You cop nuff respect again 

[Chorus] 2x 
And now you want it like every five minutes 
You recognize vintage when I spit it 
From the Illadel side all the way to Venice 
No flaws, no blimish, you lust for it endless 

[Grand Agent] 
Word life, thought you heard it last month but wasn't sure 
Now you so salty, what you lent it to your cousin for? 
Not that you thought you would see it again 
Lent the mixtape you hate, either one that you lend 
Or is it the same joint that's on your box now? 
When your man's ridin shotgun, point out the style 
Then he turn it down, speakin on some pigeony shit 
Like the whip wasn't yours, like you let him forget 
So you scrape up some manhood and give him a look 
By the time you turn it back up, you recognize the hook 
Meanwhile inside your Honda, the gonga go clockwise 
'cause you from the markets where private stock risin 
Fall by the bounce 'cause you bounce hard and plastered 
It's the same joint, it just sound better mastered 
Try to tell brothas but you couln't recollect 
How my newest labors went, you just knew it was correct 
Caught a line here, a verse there 
But the flow, you couldn't do justice 
Told them ""Look, all I know is Grand came wit it 
He followed up like a publicist"" 
You're still thinkin 'bout the tape your cousin covered it 
But can you blame her, it is off the gauge 
Required listenin for livin in the Grand Age 
It's like that... 

Chorus 2x 

[Grand Agent] 
Now I'm like Wyatt Earp, come through, quiet your turf 
Get your city up in the arms wit the science I birth 
I'm oxygen, my coast to yours 
Line the meaning up wit the jetstream and get it across 
It's all about asthetics, the sound 
Satisfaction is my attribute 
The proper noun, hands down 
It's the retail spots known as the Grand Agent 
See me at the in-store, hear me at the station 
Feel me at the concert, live is the preferred way 
Fuck what you heard, only a herb'll say wordplay 
Now you found out the livest sound out but sort out 
That be mine, your shit wasn't thought out 

Chorus 2x 

And now you want it every five minutes....",Every Five Minutes

My name is Grand Agent, closest thing to the lord
that the mic is gonn' ever know... you want to flow?
betta flow the fuck outta here. It's my era

[ VERSE ]
Raise your glass make a toast to your last brick a hope
The Grand Agent, I don't throw jab or bag coke
This high-baller had this thing about his once sour
I got the right mind to rest in this eleventh hour
I can't see God rhyming in the same game, with what's his name
you know him when you see him, he caught the fame.
Like the bouquet inside the wedding
The same fame I be dodgin' cause it came two day ahead and
For them insecure assholes with no grease
I want to be a James Todd, not a Chochise
Happily ever after, but still black
and through the hood like the good wind chill fac(tor)
Breeze through with some G's and  tools
that may or may not, necessarily be pistols
See that's for me to know, for y'all to never learn
study Grand all you gettin' is a mirror burn
I'm from the same place that you came
from the insame come'a the brains behind the son
I was thought up, brought up to be the Agent
that hits the listenin booth, with this medicinal truth
Refinement assignment, I got to grind it all the way out
break day stay out, be only seen en route
To bigger better more focussed and fruitful
other LPs you can cop this one bought you
It opens you wide as the country side
from the city though, where they shot cops like videos
This is the sounds of the grounds I'm familiar with
some down low well-educated killa shit
You can't defeat what you can't provoke
'cause what you can't provoke won't even rumble you, humbled you
Like the slap box that went too far
hit you too hard and, now you want to hurt me
Well eat me, jerk me, that's all I got for you
save the grade school shit, this is doctoral
Black pain driven, type'a talk the walk
niggas to the uncharted lands to earn the same livin
Just hold hold my hands, just blast my record
true that I'm the man but it's all about the message
The moral to the chorus the theme of the beat is
Without a big dick, all your dreams incomplete. That's why

Straight-jacket rap for the lesser
You ain't sick, you just under pressure
I know the feeling, but flows need healing
I brought holistic health in the stealth
Form of a rhyme that you felt
Man listen, I'm in the pole position, on-call physician
Ballin on a mission to get y'all to listen
That all, until you're due I'm a pioneer to proof
Until it's customary that you're tryin to hear the truth
The truth meaning (Grand) the truth meaning (Agent)
The truth meaning the most amazin
Blind-side collision to hit rap ever
If you want to live through this, then build an ark yo, this is bad waether
Welcome to the Grand Age
Clear the stage, I'm original AND paid
It's man-made, but it's God-like
I be the image of perfection when I rhyme right
Concernin me only with the learning tree
Now you can hang from it or chop it down, but either way it's murder, see
How you can afford to 
The brutal truth that I brought through
To support, not abort you, forge you to help you
Before you felt me, I felt you 
Achin for a good song 
On some monk shit - hoods on
Prayin for a real rapper to get put on
Well, here I am and here goes nothin
The neighborhood ain't get no more good after mine introduction
Man, I don't give a fuck, I don't really
You can quote that from the Pope of North Philly
Only to my nature do I credit successors
I'm one of the few who the buck blesses
And I suggestes you get right with the Lord
Get your mics and your cords
I'm the new bandwagon, all aboard

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now what the fuck was you thinkin, huh?
Whatever it was, you wasn't eatin it and sleepin it
You wasn't deep in it
When jokers see a real rapper they get real humble
I'm like the Furious 5 rolled into one rumble
For recognition bless the mission, it's on
Me and the mic is Twin Hpye, we did it 'to the crowd'
Without publicity stunt the first
It's like mad other ways to make the news
If I want, I'm blessed with the curse
I play the hermit with the gun permit
That's a certified word to the media vermin
It's a thin line between yours and mine
You write articles, I birth rhymes
Don't go sniffin around, I'm not coke
I'm chemistry, I make ?Tone Poke poke?
Tape recorder invader, black male Sinead O'Connor
James Bond'll be the white Grand Agent, honor
The monarch cup when you taste it
Treat it like the East, face it
It's the truth, I'm the roof on fire
The sixth minister got to get on
The hell Run and DMC raised, born to sit on
Thrones and take microphones where they never been
To middleground, the worst and the best of men
I mean, what's a sword without two edges, after all
Look how many knew the legends, but they had to fall
For this to be my era, my epic
Tale of a journey from the feared to respected
Revered for the records that I wrote along the path
Here's a song you can have
I'm not one for small talk, that's a false start
Like the no-rap workday offends and irks me
Yo, I never was a regular dude
Just a Agent and Grand is my secular mood
Yo, yo, I never was a regular dude
Just a Agent and Grand is my secular mood

Grand Agent,"I run through your veins like James & The Famous Flames
Name is Grand Agent, this is how you play the game
Lay up in the cut like the babies in your nuts
Even though you want to make it born, never rush
Treat it like a trick and cover up your dick and
Feel what you spit and you might write a hit and
Maybe you won't, but I still think you dope
Not the type to hope that a brother drop the soap
Like the kid up in Half Baked, check the second Quest tape
""It's the rap industry and it ain't that cool.""
But worse though it's ignorant, not to make niggas rich
Even Chuck D sell his stuff on the internet
Now you want to get outta ya deal (Fuck you talkin' 'bout?)
Don't let this rhyme change how the way you feel
Naaah, don't be mad 'cause it ain't all good
Believin' everything that you saw in the hood
It goes on and on into show-biz
With the dumb shit, on some ""Yo where you from kid?""
Now you represent that, though it's evident that
You talkin' 'bout places that you ain't never been at
In fact, I'ma say it again
Livin' by the pen is minglin' with mayhem - c'mon

See I write my own rhymes, produce my own hits
And I'm never at a loss for new shit
I take a whole song and rape it
With so much finesse though, brothers can't hate it
And if they do then so what it's all love
What I'm about to say should be dug
Rap is my bitch and your bitch is my bitch and
Some of y'all is rich, but your rhymes ain't shit
So how do you frauds like me now?
I only hit grand slams, never will I foul
Brothers pop fly when they be catchin deals
I step to your crew 'cause I know they think for you
Yo, you can't hustle down this way
""Aiyyo Grand, I heard you moved to LA!""
You gotta know folks, a whole lotta folks
But if they whack, then it don't mean jack man
You better off on your own ock
Doin this for the love of Hip Hop
I gotta thousand rhymes books at the crib
Not for show though, it's just the way I live
See, me I want the show doe, some get no dough
It's up to you though, choose your own path bro
But remember when you live by the pen
Yo kid, you're minglin with mayhem

[Chorus]

Yo, it's deadlier than being truthful
Sometimes when you that and you black then they shoot you
But the norm it's not, if you perform a lot
Make sure it's not warm, but hot
In other words, earn your stardom
Never follow something other than your own calling
Rough and rugged, not for the timid
Inside the North Blunt Illadel city limits
Learned from the greats so the flakes and fakes
Gotta hold tight, yeah they just gotta wait
I'm not speakin to upset ya, I bet the lecture
Will enhance your whole two-bit
Education on this rap shit, you got it ass backwards
Gotta speak truth regardless of the facts kid
Word - but if preferred, you can be a bitch
To get a deal you be a eight-to-one pick
It's in the handle, can you handle your pen?
Yo, you're minglin with mayhem

I got what? ""Two Bitches"" They be stakin they claim
I got what? ""Two Bitches"" But I ain't ashamed
I got what? ""Two Bitches"" I fuck 'em the same

[Grand Agent]
It's a uh, yo, yo-yo.
When I be fuckin wit my Caucasoid bitch, word up
she pull the handcuffs out then I lock the herb up
Yeah, but when I fuck my African-American babe
she want her breakfast in bed, I make the white one the maid
Now I thrust with the force of course in either case
but the black one, she always want to be in my face
So it's easy to mistake the white one for hoe
and the professional way she execute the head blow
Now, I'm a be	-boy who enjoy his freedom
but It's nothing worse than having no bitches when ya need 'em
That's why I keep a pair nearby for my provisions
My wish is their command, my command is their religion
You think it's fucked up? Then it'll stay fucked up
Stay away if you feel you too good to suck nuts
I couldn't care less what you think of me
I got two bitches and them can't wait to get a drink of me

[Chorus]

[Grand Agent]
Met the nigga bitch cruisin in the white bitch car
told her give ya pussy to me, you'll be a big star
And I try to be a man of my word so what I did
is told the white bitch to work a double shift, I need the crib
Invited forty niggas to the spot no doubt
and broadcast the VHS of me bussin it out
Niggas all on the dick for like a good two weeks
tryin to know how a broke nigga keep two freaks
I met the white bitch at this open mic café
When I was done spillin my spill, she walked my way
and said the poetry was like Spanish fly in her drink
I could tell before dawn I would be in the pink
So it was just formality we chit chat for a while
On the way to her rest, I stop off for Lifestyles
She was bent totally, so I pushed the Ac' gunnin it
She passed out, that's when I met the black one and shit

[Chorus]

[Grand Agent]
It's a uh, what.
And listen up, one paid and one dead broke
One scared of the dick, the other live for the deep throat
One dropped out and one went to college
But they both want to be the only one, do the knowledge
No bitch can be everything to a king
The bitch who recognize that, she get promoted to queen
Otherwise, they'll keep wonderin why
to them my dick is lightnin and thunder, it rain when they cry
mad tears of joy and pain for the be	-boy Christ
who fell to temptation when I brought the bliss to they life
Yeah they hate to see me go even though I came to cum
It's not about the sex or the pain that I brung
We be buildin relations in between the ep's
exchangin our philosophies, gettin further in depth
But God forbid deeper than my dick go
Just enough to keep 'em happy like a faggot in Frisco
I got.. TWO bitchezzzzzzzz

Love is like water, flowin, flowin every which way
When you think it's flown one direction
It does, it does go the other way-ayyy-ayyy

[Grand Agent]
Ohhhhhhhhahhhhhh
End to end, end to end
Experience, experience, a new sensation

Some of this is factual, most of it ain't a lie
Two days before autumn, fifty-two after July
The sun shone bright, on time was her flight
Shot to LAX absolute, positive like
Only the shit-brown '82 Corrola could
Drive up inside arrivals, guess who lookin good
like five-six, archive thick, broad hips
I downshift and coast to the curb like word
She cheesin up while I easin up, double park
Throw the blinkers on, jump out, God bless her heart
Lookin like a tourist with the duffel and camera
Throw the bags in the back, we embrace then I slam the hatch
Right back where we left off
When we built for three weeks but then I stepped off
It just so happened, we met like ships passin
Rappin, no actual action
Now here she was live, all the way from back home 
Bodily counterpart to the voice over the phone
I spoke to for strong minutes, long distance
Even wrote a note with a quote of song in it
The bus thrust me sixty East of L.A.
The length to which I went to find words to say
3K, took me three days to get here
It took her six hours - that equal twenty-three years
Love won't let me wait a minute more
There's a bomb to the left of my passenger door
with a hundred-twenty hours to diffuse it or lose it
Got to need to relate to this queen like music
Or else, else or go from wealth to poor
Never that, take the prize and floor it to the shore
No small talk, give me a medium speech
We fitta slit the wrist the of time on Manhattan Beach

[Chorus: same unknown singer]
Love is like water, flowin
flowin every which way
When you think it's flown one direction, it done
it done flown the other way

[Grand Agent]
Said the flight was peace, said she happy to see me
Said she want to check her aunt in the valley of Simi
Can't believe that she here, told I couldn't either
Right hand volleyin, gearshift receiver
Cause I play it by ear and she habitually plans
Twenty minutes we was parked fifty feet from the sand
Laid our troubles, down like bodies on the quilt
on the strand on September 21st and we built
Anatomical ebonics was the language
Speakin much silence cause we both thinkin bout the same shit
How we found ourselves back together
by a bond that was based solely on fair weather
Truth be told, we ain't even know each other
Tryin to prove that we did gave us somethin to show each other
And it can never be chumped again
We left the beach and jetted East towards the Comfort Inn
Sixty-two minute transit through Southern Cali
The hotel was near the rest in Moreno Valley
where I was stayin with a friend of the fam
who had made no concessions for a friend of the Grand
Agent at the front desk who checked us in
was Filipino, the housekeeper was Mexican
And, 217 was the room that she cleaned
After me and this queen has said and did everything
We traded baths, body massages, laughs
Future aspirations and accounts of the past
Quality time, probably rhyme material
The last breakfast: donuts, Tang, cereal
'Twas continental and the trip monumental
Did a gang of things coulda swore I wasn't into
But the swearin was impairin my ability
to give and receive love, plus humility

[Chorus]
Love is like water, flowin
flowin every which way
When you think it's flown one direction, it done
it done flown the other way
Love is like water, flowin
flowin every which way..

[Grand Agent]
Than real time, I was movin faster
On a stage, with no Ceremony to Master
But then saw the lights like the rest of my life
Just mics, no whores, imagine wives on tours
wit Momsug, Like yo, ""How would you rather...?""
The cockiness to pop quiz Wiz didn't gather
Well not before she left anyway
But I feel like I can spill and reveal it any day
And never be too soon or too late
These thoughts and others, they run through me at the gate
while, she checkin bags bout to make her trip round
Back to a world minus me she was bound
And I was left behind to write this rhyme
It took time cause she bounced with a piece of my mind
Yeah, disappear she did, my new cohort
I was back on my solo and the whole airport
it felt vacant, I'm just another face in the pool
Now that my reflection is no more visible
Back to my MCI empty identity
I wrote before she bounced even like, ""Remember me!""
Yeah whateva ya do, darlin do
Cause whateva ya did took me outta what I'm all into
Even had me second guessin my profession
Her presence like a lesson that inspired such questions
What the fuck am I still rhymin for?
If I ain't blow yet, I must got bad timin or
it ain't for me, could that possibly be?
I even lost a battle to a lesser MC
Being the fresher MC, I got my little pride hurt
for holdin the mic, like the body inside of the skirt
And practically gave the title away
Cause in a spell I would have to say, ""L.A. farewell""

Special dedication... to the bastards of the world
It's from the heart, Grand Agent

You know it's funny I ain't never had a child before
From what I hear though it's somethin magical for sure
Some in the know have told me it's like, no other rush
To feel oneself willing to receive so much
From what I hear though, you got about a dozen or so
And when they need you, we gotta let the government know
Daddy's not being supportive, so now the courts is
forever laced in recollections of your face
You wasn't checkin for me, I was just a case
Summoned you from down south, mouth full of foul taste
I heard about the drama, the shots ringin out
I know about the white bitch you was bringin to the house
Yeah, mommy put me on to all the wrongs done
But in absentia, who could defend ya? I'm your son
Not your lawyer, you innocent in my book of life
And yo I only came by to see what you look
And it's funny I could tell by the look of your lady
I was yours, cause she was raw plus she played me
like you taught her to work for you, that's my M.O.
It had to come from somewhere, Flow recognize Flow
I copped a Heineken and then like my money she slid
over to the jukebox, I followed her when she did
and asked if she knew where to find you, now mind you
I hadn't a clue what I'ma say if she do
And when she did, disappearin down a hall to fetch you
I lent the pen to my mind's eye to sketch you
Six foot three or maybe six foot two
No more guessin would a nigga ever be put through
And it's funny 'cause I wasn't really willing to bother
'til it hit me that I wasn't lookin for me a father
See, Allah's mine, and that fact padded the impact
when your lady returned and said I had to come back...

[Chorus: unknown singer]
You don't love me...
and I know now...
You don't love me...
cause you don't know how

[Grand Agent]
And it's funny, it's not that I feel fatherless
I guess what you never had is real hard to miss
My sister pop did what he could, when he could
And it's not like I was the only orphan in the hood
And damn sure wasn't at them schools I was sent to
for safekeepin in the dark, while mommy went through
her own plight, takin her demons to war
I only had dreams of home like bein on tour
where family's a foreign entity to the mind
Though mommy wrote me mad letters, I guess that's why I write better
It's funny, it came together unseen
But just between me and you, this rap shit is one dream
I had some others too, like givin wifey one or two
seeds, whe need that but not if I'ma do how you do
(Our love goes) back and forth and forth and
back from L.A. the last time I asked for her hand
And made it happen in less than a month
That's one less want, in less than like four I was out the door
I know that's probably more than you need to hear
But sayin all that to say you not bein here bred fear
I bled tears from the heart on my sleeve
A nigga needed you around like you couldn't believe
(for boys to man shit) I know life's coy and candid
No way to really plan it, that's why I don't demand shit
I'm sayin' though, but on the other hand
With flesh, you can't imagine what I'm willing to understand
So look, I'm twenty-something, with stupid money comin
I don't need you for nuttin why you still frontin?
It's beyond me
But I'm sure you know where to find me
So when you ready set your mind free

[Chorus] - repeat to end",You Don't Love Me

Grand Corps Malade,"La nuit est belle, l'air est chaud et les étoiles nous matent 
Pendant qu'on kiffe et qu'on apprécie nos plus belles vacances 
La vie est calme, il fait beau, il est 2 heures du mat' 
On est quelques sourires à partager notre insouciance 
C'est ce moment là , hors du temps, que la réalité a choisi 
Pour montrer qu'elle décide et que si elle veut elle nous malmène 
Elle a injecté dans nos joies comme une anesthésie 
Souviens-toi de ces sourires, ce sera plus jamais les mêmes 
Le temps s'est accéléré d'un coup et c'est tout mon futur qui bascule 
Les envies, les projets, les souvenirs, dans ma tête y'a trop de pensées qui se bousculent 
Le choc n'a duré qu'une seconde mais ses ondes ne laissent personne indifférent 
à‚Â« Votre fils ne marchera plus à‚Â», voilà ce qu'ils ont dit à mes parents 
Alors j'ai découvert de l'intérieur un monde parallèle 
Un monde où les gens te regardent avec gêne ou avec compassion 
Un monde où être autonome devient un objectif irréel 
Un monde qui existait sans que j'y fasse vraiment attention 
Ce monde-là vit à son propre rythme et n'a pas les mêmes préoccupations 
Les soucis ont une autre échelle et un moment banal peut être une très bonne occupation 
Ce monde là respire le même air mais pas tout le temps avec la même facilité 
Il porte un nom qui fait peur ou qui dérange : les handicapés 

On met du temps à accepter ce mot, c'est lui qui finit par s'imposer 
La langue française a choisi ce terme, moi j'ai rien d'autre à proposer 
Rappelle-toi juste que c'est pas une insulte, on avance tous sur le même chemin 
Et tout le monde crie bien fort qu'un handicapé est d'abord un être humain 
Alors pourquoi tant d'embarras face à un mec en fauteuil roulant 
Ou face à une aveugle, vas-y tu peux leur parler normalement 
C'est pas contagieux pourtant avant de refaire mes premiers pas 
Certains savent comme moi qu'y a des regards qu'on oublie pas 
C'est peut-être un monde fait de décence, de silence, de résistance 
Un équilibre fragile, un oiseau dans l'orage 
Une frontière étroite entre souffrance et espérance 
Ouvre un peu les yeux, c'est surtout un monde de courage 
Quand la faiblesse physique devient une force mentale 
Quand c'est le plus vulnérable qui sait où, quand, pourquoi et comment 
Quand l'envie de sourire redevient un instinct vital 
Quand on comprend que l'énergie ne se lit pas seulement dans le mouvement 
Parfois la vie nous teste et met à l'épreuve notre capacité d'adaptation 
Les 5 sens des handicapés sont touchés mais c'est un 6ème qui les délivre 
Bien au-delà de la volonté, plus fort que tout, sans restriction 
Ce 6ème sens qui apparaît, c'est simplement l'envie de vivre",6ème Sens
Grand Corps Malade,"J'ai oublié de commencer ce texte par une belle introduction 
J'ai oublié de vous préparer avant d'entrer en action 
J'ai oublié de vous prévenir que je m'aperçois que dans ma vie 
J'ai oublié pas mal de choses si vous voulez mon avis 
J'ai oublié d'être sage, j'ai oublié d'être prudent 
J'ai oublié de me ménager et je me suis cassé les dents 
On m'a dit qu'on ne pouvait pas être et avoir été 
Moi j'ai oublié de faire attention a moi une nuit d'été 
J'ai oublié ce que c'est de courir derrière un ballon 
J'ai oublié d'être fort comme Achille et son talon 
J'ai oublié de remercier mes parents pour tout ce qu'ils ont fait 
Mais je suis pas doué pour ce genre de trucs, c'est pas moi le fils parfait 
J'ai oublié de prendre des risques dans l'ensemble de mon parcours 
Et quand je regarde derrière moi, parfois j'ai le souffle court 
J'ai traversé les années plus vite qu'on passe un péage 
J'ai oublié de prendre le temps de voir passer les nuages 
J'ai oublié d'écrire un texte sur la force de l'amitié 
Qui met l'amour à l'amende dont la faiblesse me fait pitié 
Y'a pas beaucoup de meufs qui m'ont vraiment fait me retourner 
J'ai oublié de tomber amoureux depuis quelques années 

J'ai oublié d'imaginer de quoi seront faites les années prochaines 
Et quand on me parle de l'avenir, j'ai tendance à  changer de chaîne 
J'ai oublié de payer mon amende pour m'être garé devant la station 
Tant pis pour moi, maintenant j'ai 30% de majoration 
J'ai oublié de faire en sorte que ce texte soit structuré 
Ça part dans tous les sens tant que ma feuille n'est pas saturée 
J'ai oublié de mettre des baggys et des ensembles en peau de pêche 
J'ai oublié d'avoir du style et c'est comme ça depuis la crèche 
J'ai oublié de chialer depuis un sacré bout de temps 
Une sorte de sécheresse ophtalmique, s'en est presque inquiétant 
Je sais pas si c'est normal mais c'est vrai que pour être franc 
La dernière fois que j'ai versé une larme, on achetait le pain avec des francs 
Dans ces vers, j'ai oublié d'arrêter de parler de moi 
J'ai oublié de m'oublier comme un premier samedi du mois 
J'ai l'impression de me mettre à  poil depuis bientôt un quart d'heure 
Sur ce coup là  j'ai oublié de garder pas mal de pudeur 
J'ai oublié de croire en l'existence d'un être supérieur 
J'aime pas les jeux de hasard j'ai toujours été mauvais parieur 
Par ailleurs, tant mieux, car je ne pourrais pas m'empêcher 
De me dépêcher de me sauver pour pas confesser mes péchés 
J'ai la pêche et à  cette façade, faut pas forcément te fier 
J'ai pas oublié d'être un con fier qu'a du mal à  se confier 
J'ai oublié de me plaindre quand ça en valait la peine 
J'ai oublié d'ouvrir les vannes quand la coupe était pleine 
A ce putain de texte, j'ai oublié de trouver une chute 
Comme un cascadeur qui saute d'un avion sans parachute 
Mais chut! Faut que je me taise, car maintenant c'est la fin 
A vrai dire pas tout à  fait car pour l'instant j'ai encore faim 
J'ai oublié d'écrire ce que je crois et ce que je pense vraiment 
J'ai oublié de croire à  ce que j'écris machinalement 
Mais finalement c'est peut-être mieux car se rappeler c'est subir 
J'ai oublié de penser qu'il était préférable de se souvenir 
J'ai oublié mon flow, j'ai oublié mon stylo 
J'ai oublié mon micro et j'ai oublié tous les mots 
J'ai oublié des tas de sujets, vous avez compris le concept 
Alors pour pas trop vous saoulez je vais m'arrêter d'un coup sec",J'ai Oublié
Grand Corps Malade,"J'ai constaté que la douleur était une bonne source d'inspiration 
Et que les zones d'ombre du passé montrent au stylo la direction 
La colère et la galère sont des sentiments productifs 
Qui donnent des thèmes puissants, quoi qu'un peu trop répétitifs 
A croire qu'il est plus facile de livrer nos peines et nos cris 
Et qu'en un battement de cils un texte triste est écrit 
On se laisse aller sur le papier et on emploie trop de métaphores 
Pourtant je t'ai déjà  dit que tout ce qui ne nous tue pas nous rend plus forts 
C'est pour ça qu'aujourd'hui j'ai décidé de changer de thème 
D'embrasser le premier connard venu pour lui dire je t'aime 
Des lyrics pleins de vie avec des rimes pleines d'envie 
Je vois, je veux, je vis, je vais, je viens, je suis ravi 
C'est peut-être une texte trop candide mais il est plein de sincérité 
Je l'ai écrit avec une copine, elle s'appelle Sérénité 
Toi tu dis que la vie est dure et au fond de moi je pense pareil 
Mais je garde les idées pures et je dors sur mes 2 oreilles 
Evidemment on marche sur un fil, chaque destin est bancal 
Et l'existence est fragile comme une vertèbre cervicale 
On t'a pas vraiment menti, c'est vrai que parfois tu vas saigner 
Mais dans chaque putain de vie, y'a tellement de choses à  gagner 

J'aime entendre, raconter, j'aime montrer et j'aime voir 
J'aime apprendre, partager, tant qu'y a de l'échange y'a de l'espoir 
J'aime les gens, j'aime le vent, c'est comme ça je joue pas un rôle 
J'ai envie, j'ai chaud, j'ai soif, j'ai hâte, j'ai faim et j'ai la gaule 
J'espère que tu me suis, dans ce que je dis y'a rien de tendancieux 
Quand je ferme les yeux, c'est pour mieux ouvrir les cieux 
C'est pas une religion, c'est juste un état d'esprit 
Y'a tellement de choses à  faire et ça maintenant je l'ai compris 
Chaque petit moment banal, je suis capable d'en profiter 
Dans la vie j'ai tellement de kifs que je pourrai pas tous les citer 
Moi en été je me sens vivre, mais en hiver c'est pareil 
J'ai tout le temps l’œil du tigre, et je dors sur mes 2 oreilles 

C'est pas moi le plus chanceux mais je me sens pas le plus à  plaindre 
Et j'ai compris les règles du jeu, ma vie c'est moi qui vais la peindre 
Alors je vais y mettre le feu en ajoutant plein de couleurs 
Moi quand je regarde par la fenêtre je vois que le béton est en fleur 
J'ai envie d'être au coeur de la ville et envie d'être au bord de la mer 
De voir le delta du Nil et j'ai envie d'embrasser ma mère 
J'ai envie d'être avec les miens et j'ai envie de faire des rencontres 
J'ai les moyens de me sentir bien et ça maintenant je m'en rends compte 
Je voulais pas écrire un texte à petite maison dans la prairie à
Mais j'étais de bonne humeur et même mon stylo m'a souri 
Et puis je me suis demandé si j'avais le droit de pas être rebelle 
D'écrire un texte de slam pour affirmer que la vie est belle 
Si tu me chambres je m'en bats les reins, parfois je me sens inattaquable 
Parce que je suis vraiment serein et je suis pas prêt de péter un câble 
La vie c'est gratuit je vais me resservir et tu devrais faire pareil 
Moi je me couche avec le sourire et je dors sur mes 2 oreilles 

La vie c'est gratuit je vais me resservir et ce sera toujours pareil 
Moi je me couche avec le sourire et je dors sur mes 2 oreilles",Je Dors sur Mes 2 Oreilles
Grand Corps Malade,"S’il y a bien une idée qui rassemble, une pensée qu’est pas toute neuve 
C’est que quel que soit ton parcours, tu rencontres de belles épreuves
La vie c’est Mister Hyde, pas seulement Docteur Jekyll 
J’ai vu le film depuis longtemps, la vie n’est pas un long fleuve tranquille

T’as qu’à voir les réactions d’un nouveau-né à l’hôpital 
S’il chiale si fort, c’est qu’il comprend que souvent la vie va lui faire mal 
Y’a des rires, y’a des pleurs, y’a des bas, y’a des hauts 
Y’a des soleils et des orages et je te parle pas que de météo

On vit dans un labyrinthe et y’a des pièges à chaque virage 
À nous de les esquiver et de pas calculer les mirages
Mais le destin est un farceur, on peut tomber à chaque instant 
Pour l’affronter, faut du cœur et un mental de résistant

J’ai des cicatrices plein la peau et quelques-unes dans mes souvenirs 
Y’a des rescapés partout, j’suis qu'un exemple, ça va sans dire
Ça doit se sentir, faut pas se mentir, la vie c’est aussi la guérison 
Après la foudre, prend toi en main et redessine ton horizon

Y’a des tempêtes sans visages où on doit se battre contre le pire 
Personne n’y échappe, Rouda c’est pas toi qui vas me contredire
C’est l’ultime épreuve où tu affrontes la pire souffrance morale 
Quand la peine rejoint l’impuissance pour la plus triste des chorales

J’ai vu des drames à cœurs ouverts, j’ai vu des gens qui s’accrochent 
Ce qui est bien avec le drame, c’est que tu le partage avec tes proches
Pour les miens il est peut être l’heure de m’arrêter un court instant 
Pour les remercier d’avoir du cœur et un mental de résistant

La vie est aussi perverse, ce que tu désires elle l’a caché 
Elle te le donnera pas tout cuit, va falloir le chercher
Du coup ce qu’on a, on le mérite, au hasard on rien piqué au hasard 
Et si t’as pas compris, va voir mes potes ils vont t’expliquer

Jacky, tu m’as dit que l’ascenseur social était bloqué 
Toi t’es allé chez Otis et le réparateur tu l’as braqué
Sans craquer, sans rémissions, t’as affronté de vraies missions 
Tu m’as montré qu’avoir du mental, c’est aussi avoir de l’ambition

Y’a pas de chemin facile, Brahim t’as rien demandé à personne 
T’as tout construit de tes mains et y’a pas que moi que tu impressionnes
Toi Sami t’es notre moteur parce que tu sais depuis longtemps
Que pour ça chémar il faut du cœur et un mental de résistant

Je crois qu’on a tous une bonne étoile sauf que des fois elle est bien planquée 
Certaines même plus que d’autres, il faut aller les débusquer
Parfois ça prend du temps quand tu fais trois fois le tour du ciel 
Mais si tu cherches c’est que tu avances, à mon avis c’est l’essentiel

Je fais partie de ceux qui pensent qu’y a pas de barrière infranchissable
Il faut y croire un peu, y’a bien des fleurs qui poussent dans le sable
Et c’est quand tu te bats qu’il y a des belles victoires que tu peux arracher
Comme se relever avec une moelle épinière en papier mâché

Je n’apprends rien à personne, tu es vivant tu sais ce que c’es
Vivre c’est accepter la douleur, les échecs et les décès
Mais c’est aussi plein de bonheur, on va le trouver en insistant 
Et pour ça, faut du cœur et un mental de résistant",Mental

Les capteurs s'émerveillent, répondant à l'appel
En un battement de cils, ils oscillent dociles
Vulnérables et puissants, équilibre fragile

Ça commence par la vue, rien n'est fait au hasard
Comme elle ôte ses vêtements, il l'habille du regard
Il la parcourt doucement, il n'a d'yeux que pour elle
Elle le tient et il y tient, comme à leurs prunelles

Elle n'a pas froid aux yeux, lui son œil est rincé
Comme il navigue à vue, il voudrait l'embrasser
Elle approche fébrile pour amorcer le jeu
Son visage et son corps, il en a plein les yeux

Elle est tout près de lui, imposant son aura
Comme un réflexe bestial se réveille l'odorat
Les pupilles se dilatent, les paupières sont fermées
Maintenant s'il la voit, c'est bien à vue de nez

Il respire son parfum et l'odeur de sa peau
Son arôme est si fin, c'est un nouveau cadeau
Et puisqu'il a du flair, elle va lui en donner
Il adore qu'elle le mène, par le bout du nez

Leurs bouches se rejoignent, le baiser le plus doux
Ses lèvres et puis sa langue, il aime déjà leur goût
Comme elle goûte à son charme, ils iront jusqu'au bout
C'est une femme de classe et un homme de goût

On dépasse la tendresse, maintenant le temps presse
Les pulsions apparaissent au départ des caresses
Car le sens qui prend place est celui du toucher
Ils étaient bien debout, ils seront mieux couchés

Il l'effleure de ses doigts, de ses mains, de sa bouche
Il sent bien que sa manière de la toucher la touche
Comme c'est un touche-à-tout, bien sûr il n'oublie rien
Elle n'est pas sainte-ni-touche, alors elle lui rend bien

Pour être consentant, il est bon qu'on s'entende

Grand Corps Malade,"Acte 1, scène 1, unité de temps, unité de lieu
La pièce durera toute ta vie, l'histoire se déroule sous tes yeux.
Le rideau vient de s'ouvrir, toi tu soulèves les paupières.
Tes parents gèrent la mise en scène, ta pièce démarre et ils sont fiers
Ils te souhaitent pas une tragédie, ils préfèrent que l'histoire soit drôle.
C'est le théâtre de ta vie, c'est toi qui tient le premier rôle,
Tu regardes autour de toi les projecteurs, les premiers rangs,
Les gens qui te donnent la réplique et puis les autres, les figurants.

Tes parents ont écrit le début, mais tu vas vite réaliser
Que pour la suite, c'est entendu, tu vas devoir improviser,
Et puis trouver les bons dialogues, dans ce premier acte, tu es bavard,
Ce ne sera pas une pièce d'auteur, mais du théâtre de boulevard.
Alors ton histoire défile sous la rumeur des spectateurs,
Ton personnage perd l'innocence, t'essaies de rester à la hauteur,
Face aux premières piques de l'intrigue, face aux premiers mauvais accords,
Derrière les apparences bien lisses, tu découvres l'enfer du décor.

Au théâtre on joue ta vie, j'ai vu ton nom sur l'affiche
Le scénar' est en friche, modifie-le, tu t'en fiches
Pour jouer les plus belles scènes et à l'heure de saluer le public,
Que tu aies le privilège d'avoir deux ou trois bonnes critiques
Au théâtre on joue ta vie, j'ai vu ton nom sur l'affiche
L'histoire peut être riche, faut pas que tu traînes, faut pas que tu triches
Pour t'offrir de l'ivresse, du vertige, de l'émotion,
Et qu'à la fin les gens se lèvent pour ta dernière ovation.

Alors de cour à jardin, maintenant tu fais les cent pas,
Tu côtoies les bons comédiens, et puis y a ceux que tu sens pas.
On flirte avec le vaudeville avec toutes ces portes qui claquent,
Tu vois moins tes parents, ingratitude du deuxième acte.
Tu l'as compris sur les planches, c'est la cour de création,
Dans toutes les situations, tu vas faire preuve d'adaptation,
Dans un monde où le prévisible perd souvent le contrôle,
Le bon comédien est celui qui sait jouer tous les rôles

Et c'est là qu'intervient celle qui donne du sens à ta pièce,
Sous les feux de la rampe, ta prétendante met tes attentes en liesse,
Tout prend de l'importance, c'est ce que ton monologue indique
Fini le théâtre de boulevard, tu tiens ta tragédie antique.
Si tout va bien, l'amour donnera de nouveaux petits acteurs,
Qui à leur tour, joueront leur pièce devant la foule des spectateurs.
Tu mettras en scène leurs débuts, t'as compris les règles du pacte,
Avant de retrouver l'énergie de t'atteler à ton troisième acte.
Du public, on voit tes doutes, on voit tes gouttes, on voit la sueur,
Tes déboires, tes trous de mémoire, tes espoirs et tes lueurs
Le second rôle apprécie, c'est respectable et vibrant,
Les spectateurs vibrent aussi, c'est du spectacle vivant.

A quelques exceptions près, toutes les pièces se ressemblent un peu,
Ça tourne autour de sentiments, tu sens, tu mens, tu vis, tu veux,
Y a que le décor et les costumes qui sont amenés à changer,
Ça dépend des moyens de la prod', on a pas tous les mêmes budgets.
Moi j'ai grandi au cœur d'un beau théâtre occidental,
Loin des troupes du tiers-monde et des acteurs qui ont la dalle,
J'aime le théâtre de ces pays où la scène est à même le ciel,
Où les intrigues se resserrent souvent autour des valeurs essentielles.

A quelques exceptions près, toutes les pièces se ressemblent un peu,
Y a les grandes scènes de comédies et les bouts de drames contagieux,
Et puis y a tous ces imprévus, ces fous rires, ces dérapages,
Moi je n'aime ce théâtre que quand l'intrigue sort de la page.
Sois patient, reste en coulisse quand résonnent les coups de tonnerre,
Et quand la scène est compliquée, appuie-toi sur tes partenaires.
Ils te seront indispensables pour atteindre tes objectifs,
N'oublie jamais cet adjectif, le théâtre est un art collectif.
A toi d'observer dans l'ombre quand on t'attend dans la lumière
A toi de prendre le devant de la scène quand le scénario te prévoit derrière
Écorche un peu ce qui est écrit, la vie aura un autre parfum
Ta pièce aura une plus belle fin, écoute une dernière fois ce refrain

Au théâtre on joue ta vie, j'ai vu ton nom sur l'affiche
Le scénar' est en friche, modifie-le, tu t'en fiches
Pour jouer les plus belles scènes et à l'heure de saluer le public,
Que tu aies le privilège d'avoir deux ou trois bonnes critiques
Au théâtre on joue ta vie, j'ai vu ton nom sur l'affiche
L'histoire peut être riche, faut pas que tu traînes, faut pas que tu triches
Pour t'offrir de l'ivresse, du vertige, de l'émotion,
Et qu'à la fin les gens se lèvent pour ta dernière ovation.",Au théâtre
Grand Corps Malade,"9 Décembre '84
Il tient la main de sa copine pour défier l'hiver
La nuit part pour être belle
Mais elle se transforme vite en triste fait divers
Ils se croient seuls au monde dans les ruelles
Mais à l'évidence ils ne le sont plus
Deux Skinheads en manque d'embrouilles et d'adrénaline viennent leur tomber dessus
Une gifle pour éloigner la fille
Les mecs le rouent de coups à deux contre un
Le visage contre le bitume glacé voyant la mort arriver il se sent contraint
De sortir son arme car il est tout sauf un enfant de cœur
L'un des Skins meurt sur le coup et l'autre hurle encore sa douleur

Tout est allé si vite mais pourquoi ces mecs se sont retrouvés sur son chemin?
La douleur physique n'est rien quand il la compare à la peur du lendemain
Il s'est rendu au matin plaidant la légitime défense corporelle
Il est jugé en quelques mois en prends 10 ans de réclusion criminelle
Il pense souvent à eux, il rêve tout le temps à elle
Il a beau regarder très loin il ne voit pas le bout du tunnel
Il découvre le cauchemar, l'humiliation, les matelas crades,
Les pieds enchaînés lors des transferts, et les bagarres lors des promenades,
Et alors qu'il subit depuis plus d'un an le système carcéral,
Une terrible nouvelle vient ajouter sa voix à la triste chorale,
Il est porteur d'un étrange virus que le monde découvre craintif,
1985 Nouvelle sentence, il est séropositif
Aucun traitement n'existe, plus rien à perdre il se sent condamné à mort
Alors il va être le plus fou dans un monde où c'est la loi du plus fort
Il tombe dans tous les pièges là où la spirale de la violence se corse,
Et puisqu'on le traite comme un chien, alors il sera le chien le plus féroce
Il sort enfin au bout de huit ans, l'avenir aussi triste que son paquetage
Les poches vides mais le sang plein de rage alors il monte sur un braquage
Il se fait serrer un an plus tard et c'est le retour à la case cauchemar
A la case où tout est sombre et où la nuit dure des semaines isolé au mitard
Il ne pense plus à eux il ne rêve plus à elle
Il n'ose même plus regarder devant, il est trop loin le bout du tunnel
Ou alors ce bout du tunnel, il va falloir se le construire
Il sait que s'il ne tente rien, c'est dans ces murs qu'il va mourir

9 Octobre '94, date d'anniversaire de l'abolition de la peine de mort
Il réussit son évasion et abolit lui-même son triste sort
Quelques mois de cavale seulement avant de rejoindre les murs tout gris
Quelques mois de liberté agités avant de repeindre les murs d'oubli
Il est alors placé directement dans les quartiers de haute sécurité
A l'isolement pendant 5 ans, on lui dit que c'est tout ce qu'il a mérité
Quand il se regarde dans le miroir, il a peur de ce que le reflet lui montre
C'est vrai ça n'a jamais été un tendre mais la prison a fait de lui un monstre
Un malheur n'arrivant jamais seul, le sida se déclare, la maladie s'installe
Il meurt peu à peu sans assistance et dans l'indifférence la plus totale
1995 À deux doigts de quitter la prison pour le cimetière
La trithérapie fait son apparition et lui remet doucement les pieds sur terre
Poussé à nouveau vers la vie et essayant de voir derrière les barreaux de fer
Il se marie avec celle qu'il aime, ses sentiments réchauffent enfin l'atmosphère
Mais son jugement toujours en attente finit un sale jour par tomber
Pour évasion et braquage il prend 30 ans, le bout du tunnel s'est estompé
Pourtant il garde en lui l'espoir, il a tellement tutoyé la mort
Il se sent invincible c'est sûr il sait qu'un jour il retournera dehors
En 2000 il se met à écrire, sa nouvelle arme pour survivre face au système
Il gratte jour et nuit, ce n'est plus lui désormais mais c'est son stylo qui saigne
Il écrit son premier livre et tient en ligne le premier blog d'un prisonnier,
Ses œuvres transpercent les portes blindées et maintenant plus personne ne peut nier
Qu'il est vivant, qu'il existe, qu'il réinvente le mot avenir,
En 2008 naît sa fille et l'amour et la vie ne sont plus des souvenirs
Il a les mains sur ses stylos, fini le temps des mains en l'air
""Avant je m'évadais au pistolet,
Aujourd'hui je m'évade à l'épistolaire""
Il sort en janvier 2010 avec des projets et des repères
Après 25 ans passé dans un tunnel,
Laurent a rejoint la lumière.",Le Bout du tunnel
Grand Corps Malade,"Eh Tonton, est-ce que t’as regardé dehors?
Sur l’avenir de nos enfants il pleut de plus en plus fort
Quand je pense à eux pourtant, j’aimerais chanter un autre thème
Mais je suis plus trop serein, je fais pas confiance au système
Ce système fait des enfants mais il les laisse sur le chemin
Et il oublie que s’il existe, c’est pour gérer des êtres humains
On avance tous tête baissée sans se soucier du plan final
Ce système entasse des gosses et il les regarde crever la dalle
Tonton on est du bon côté mais ce qu’on voit, on ne peut le nier
J’ai grandi au milieu de ceux que le système a oubliés
On vit sur le même sol mais les fins de mois n’ont pas le même parfum
Et chaque année monte un peu plus la rumeur des crève-la-faim
Le système a décidé qu’y avait pas de place pour tout le monde
Tonton, t’as entendu les cris dehors, c’est bien notre futur qui gronde
Le système s’est retourné contre l’homme, perdu dans ses ambitions
L’égalité est en travaux et y’a beaucoup trop de déviations

Eh Tonton, on va faire comment?
Dis-moi Tonton, on va faire comment?

Est-ce que les hommes ont voulu ça, est-ce qu’ils maîtrisent leur rôle
Ou est-ce que la machine s’est emballée et qu’on a perdu le contrôle
Est-ce qu’y a encore quelqu’un quelque part qui décide de quelque chose
Ou est-ce qu’on est tous pieds et poings liés en attendant que tout explose
Difficile de me rassurer Tonton, je te rappelle au passage
Que l’homme descend bel et bien du singe pas du sage
Et c’est bien l’homme qui regarde mourir la moitié de ses frères
Qui arrache les derniers arbres et qui pourrit l’atmosphère
Y’a de plus en plus de cases sombres et de pièges sur l’échiquier
L’avenir n’a plus beaucoup de sens dans ce monde de banquiers
C’est les marchés qui nous gouvernent, mais ces tous ces chiffres sont irréels
On est dirigé par des graphiques, c’est de la branlette à grande échelle

Eh Tonton, on va faire comment, tu peux me dire?
Comme il faut que tout soit rentable, on privatisera l’air qu’on respire
C’est une route sans issue, c’est ce qu’aujourd’hui, tout nous démontre
On va tout droit vers la défaite dans cette course contre la honte

Eh Tonton, on va faire comment?
Dis-moi Tonton, on va faire comment?

Entre le fromage et le dessert, tout là-haut dans leur dîner
Est-ce que les grands de ce monde ont entendu le cri des indignés
Dans le viseur de la souffrance, y’a de plus en plus de cibles
Pour l’avenir, pour les enfants, essayons de ne pas rester insensibles

Ma petite gueule d’amour, mon Polo, mon ami Châtaigne
On va rien lâcher, on va aimer regarder derrière pour rien oublier,
Ni les yeux bleus ni les regards noirs
On perdra rien, peut-être bien un peu,
Mais ce qu’il y a devant, c’est si grand
Ma petite gueule d’amour, mon Polo, mon ami Châtaigne
T’as bien le temps d’avoir le chagrin éternel
S’ils veulent pas le reconstruire le nouveau monde, on se mettra au boulot
Il faudra de l’utopie et du courage
Faudra remettre les pendules à l’heure, leur dire qu’on a pas le même tic tac,
Que nous, il est plutôt du côté du cœur
Fini le compte à rebours du vide, du rien dedans
Ma gueule d’amour, mon petit pote d’azur
Il est des jours où je ne peux rien faire pour toi
Les conneries je les ai faites, et c’est un chagrin qui s’efface pas
Faut pas manquer beaucoup pour plus être le héros, faut pas beaucoup
Je t’jure petit frère, faut freiner à temps
Va falloir chanter l’amour, encore plus fort
Y’aura des révolutions qu’on voudra pas, et d’autres qui prennent leur temps,
Pourtant c’est urgent
Où est la banque, il faut que je mette une bombe,
Une bombe désodorante,
Une bombe désodorante pour les mauvaises odeurs du fric qui déborde
Pas de place pour les gentils, les paumés de la vie
Chez ces gens-là, on aime pas, on compte

Ma petite gueule d’amour, mon Polo, mon ami Châtaigne
P’tit frère, putain, on va le reconstruire ce monde
Pour ça, Tonton, faut lui tendre la main
Tonton, il peut rien faire si t’y crois pas
Alors faudra se regarder, se découvrir, jamais se quitter
On va rien lâcher
On va rester groupé
Y’a les frères, les cousines, les cousins, y'a les petits de la voisine,
Y’a les gamins perdus qui deviennent des caïds de rien,
Des allumés qui s’enflamment pour faire les malins
Y’a la mamie qui peut pas les aider, qu’a rien appris dans les livres,
Mais qui sait tout de la vie
À force de ne plus croire en rien, c’est la vie qui désespère
Faut aimer pour être aimé
Faut donner pour recevoir
Viens vers la lumière, p’tit frère
Ta vie c’est comme du gruyère, mais personne te le dis que tu as une belle âme
Ma petite gueule d’amour, mon Polo, mon ami Châtaigne
On va rien lâcher
On va aimer regarder derrière pour rien oublier",Course contre la honte
Grand Corps Malade,"Chacun mène sa barque comme il veut, comme il peut
Avec plus ou moins de succès quand il vente, quand il pleut
Car la vie est arbitraire, il y a des traversées amères
Qu’on ose me dire le contraire, on vogue pas tous sur les mêmes mers
C’est juste un texte et quelques notes pour ces enfants pris dans les vagues
Coincés sur leur lit d’hôpital face à un avenir qui zigzague
Entre symptômes douloureux, traitements lourds, effets secondaires
L’inquiétude que l’on gagne, l’innocence que l’on perd
J’ai vu des tempêtes s’abattre sur des enfants de 10 ans
Quand le diagnostic tombe, c’est l’injustice au présent
T’as beau descendre la grand-voile, y’a trop de courant et trop tôt
Qu’on ose me dire le contraire, on est pas tous dans le même bateau

J’ai grandi dans les vagues
Je me suis heurtée contre les parois
D’un bateau qui divague
Je me suis heurtée contre les pourquoi
J’ai grandi dans les vagues
Guettant l’éclaircie quand le vent s’entête
J’ai grandi dans les drames
Souriant à la vie entre deux tempêtes
Entre deux tempêtes

J’ai vu ces enfants au mental de guerrier plein d’honneur
Traverser les années au milieu d’une mer de peur
Affrontant les tornades, la tête haute dans les orages
Tenant la barre, capitaine d’un bateau nommé courage
Ils font face à la pression et ils résistent comme personne
Comment vous dire et sur quel ton tous ces enfants m’impressionnent
J’ai vu leur force, leur dignité quand leur destin fronce les sourcils
Après tout ça, entendre se plaindre monsieur Tout-le-monde m’est difficile
Quand la croisière de l’enfance pleine de candeur loin des colères
Devient un voyage harassant au fond d’une cale dans une galère
On devrait juste avoir le droit de rester enfant dans le fond des yeux
Mais on est vite moins jeune dès que le temps est pluvieux

J’ai grandi dans les vagues
Je me suis heurtée contre les parois

J’ai grandi dans les drames
Souriant à la vie entre deux tempêtes
Entre deux

J’ai connu les pics de douleur
Les grandes chambres à l’absence de couleur
Les progrès, les rechutes, les débuts d’guérison
L’espoir à contre-jour et le manque d’horizon

Contre vents et marées
J’ai gagné le droit de vieillir
Et celui d’espérer une mer plus calme pour voir l’avenir

Grand Corps Malade,"A chaque époque on se cherche un peu et on s'demande si on s'connaît
On est nous même on fait ce qu'on peut on changera pas c'est c'qu'on s'promet.
Entre bitume et tapis rouge j'ai slalomé de par et par
J'côtoie la déch' et l'opulence j'apprend à faire le grand écart.
La vie propose tellement de thème parfois je fonce parfois je freine,
J'vois les deux côtés du système pourtant j'me sent pas schizophrène
J'essaie de pas trop faire d'erreur et dans mes choix je me sens libre
Je crois en c'truc du fond du cœur tout est une question d'équilibre.
C'est pour ce besoin d'équilibre que j'ai dû prendre un peu de risques,
Après un mauvais coup du sort ma vie partait pour être triste.
Écarté des terrain de sport comme un sursaut j'ai compensé,
J'avais besoin d'un autre support dans l'écriture j'me suis lancé
C'est pour ce besoin d'équilibre qu'il me fallait de l'aventure,
Toute mon histoire se refermait fallait trouver une ouverture
J'ai touché l’accélérateur pour retrouver des sensations
Car quand je marche à deux à l'heure il m'fallait une compensation.

Je suis un funambule, j'avance loin des certitudes
Les pieds sur terre l'air dans ma bulle
L'équilibre est une attitude
Je suis un funambule (funambule)
J'avance loin des certitudes

Je suis un funambule, j'avance loin des certitudes

Alors j'ai croisé le show-biz, j'ai vu le royaume des égos
Qui pourra faire le plus d'entrées, qui provoquera le plus d'écho?
J'ne cracherai pas dans la soupe, là où je suis je me sens bien
Mais pour garder mon équilibre je n'oublierai pas d'où je viens
C'est pour ce besoin d'équilibre que je garde un peu de hors-piste
Car j'aime aussi la vie d'humain quand s’interrompt la vie d'artiste
Entre la lumière de la lune et celle des spots, maintenant je sais
Que j'ai ma place à l'Olympia, mais aussi dans les M.J.C.
Je prends du recule, je prends des gants quand j'vois le strass et les paillettes
Les gentils se sentent importants, moi ils me stressent, ils sont pas nets
J'ne cracherai pas dans la soupe, j'ai rencontré des gens très bien
Mais j'me reconnaîtrai toujours plus dans ceux qui viennent là d'où je viens
C'est pour ce besoin d'équilibre qu'on a joué dans des cathédrales
Mais juste après yeux dans les yeux avec un public carcéral
C'est pour ce besoin d'équilibre que tous mes sentiments se touchent
Quand je vois le public se lever, je pense à mon fils qui se couche.

Je suis un funambule, j'avance loin des certitudes

Si j'aime la nuit c'est grâce au jour et j'aime le jour grâce à la nuit,
J'aime être tout seul grâce à la foule et grâce au silence j'aime le bruit.
Besoin d'tout ça pour que ça vibre j'me sentir fort et avoir peur
Tout est une question d'équilibre je crois en c'truc du fond du cœur
Si dans une vie ça part en vrille c'est qu'l'équilibre à vrillé
Pour le garder c'est capital de pas dormir sur ses lauriers
Alors je reste vigilant quitte à recréer du désordre
Entre le glacé et le brûlant j'aime la douceur j'aime que ça morde
L'équilibre est dans la nature j'invente rien ça va sans dire,
Il faut d'la pluie et du soleil pour que la fleur puisse s'épanouir
Faut l’exception dans la règle pour que la vie ait plus de goût
Il faut d'la force et de l'adresse pour que l'enfant se mette debout
J'met d'la lumière pour voir l'avenir mais parfois j'aime autant l'éteindre
Dans la vie on se fout de l'objectif c'qui compte c'est la route pour l'atteindre
Alors j'avance sur un fil parmi les chemins qui s'éparpillent
En équilibre mal habile, je suis un funambule à béquilles

Je suis un funambule, j'avance loin des certitudes
Les pieds sur terre l'air dans ma bulle
L'équilibre est une attitude
Je suis un funambule (funambule)

J’ai mis des mots que j’ai triés
J’espérais bien me faire griller
J’ai mis des mots que j’ai criés
J’ai mis des mots dans vos oreilles
Ou des émotions c’est pareil
Dans vos théâtres et vos enceintes
J’ai mis des mots comme une empreinte
J’ai mis des mots un peu partout
Redistribués au coup par coup
Je sais même plus où je les ai mis
J’ai mis des mots j’ai pas gémi
J’ai mis des mots mais jamais trop
Dans un métro dans un micro
J’ai mis des mots j’ai eu les crocs
Des mots nouveaux des mots rétros
J’ai mis des mots pour compenser
J’ai pas le destin qu’on pensait
Mais en passant sur le passé
On peut tracer sans effacer
J’ai mis des mots j’ai pas médit
J’ai mis des do j’émets des mi

J’ai oublié les médisants
J’ai mis des mots c’est mes 10 ans
J’ai mis des mots j’ai des raisons
Coupable de combinaisons
Et je crée sans comparaison
Des horizons à chaque saison
Dans plein de pays j’ai mis des mots
Berlin Québec ou Bamako
J’ai même trouvé des mots en route
J’ai mis des mots jusqu’à Beyrouth
J’ai mis des mots dans tous les sens
À l’envers à l’effervescence
Des mots sympas ou en colère
Des mots bien droits ou en galère
J’ai mis des mots c’est dérisoire
Parfois tranchants c’est des rasoirs
Mais bien placés c’est opportun
J’ai mis des mots c’est important
J’ai trouvé de l’inspiration
Pour inspirer mes directions
Pour continuer sans crispation
Je reprends ma respiration

Tous ces mots ça fait des rencontres
Je m’en rends compte je suis pas contre
J’ai mis des mots à l’infini
J’ai pas failli c’est pas fini

J’émets des vœux jamais urgents

Grand Corps Malade,"Un certain soir d'incertitude,
Je suis allé voir une voyante.
Prêt pour l'arnaque et l'inquiétude,
Car la vision de l'avenir est payante.
C'est mon cœur qui frappe quand je sonne à la porte,
Je me sens tout gamin
Quand elle ouvre, me regarde, me sourit et m'escorte
Pour me lire les lignes de la main.

Elle prend son pied en prenant mes mains,
Ses mains tenant mes doigts sont balèzes.
Elle est adroite et j'ai deux mains gauches, ses mains tenant mon malaise.
Elle a la main forte, elle a la main ferme, elle a la main mise
Parfois où je sorte, je veux revenir demain, mes deux mains sont prises.
Sa main est agile, et ça m'indispose que sa main tripote,
Car sa main est curieuse, et sa main est fouineuse, ça m'insupporte.
Mais ça m'intéresse quand sa main se calme car sa main est belle
Oui sa main est douce et sa main est chaude et ça m'interpelle.

Elle prend ma main gauche pour me lire les lignes,
Moi j'ai un mauvais feeling,
Car elle veut être précise, mais moi je lui propose de rester dans les grande lignes.
Ses doigts glissent sur ma peau comme une piste de cœur ligne,
Elle vise la ligne de cœur,
C'est une ligne à haute tension, elle est en première ligne,
Une ligne à la hauteur.

Niveau cœur, pas besoin de savoir lire entre les lignes,
Elle voit que la ligne est occupée.
C'est une ligne droite magnifique, longiligne, rectiligne,
La ligne printemps été.
En revanche la voyance ne trouve pas ma ligne de chance, j'ai vraiment pas de pot.
On l'avait en ligne de mire, moi j'avais envie d'en rire, elle l'a ripé sur un bout de peau.
Mais en ligne de compte elle a retrouvé ma chance, c'est une vraie pilote de ligne.
La ligne de chance aime bien faire des feintes, elle est maligne ma ligne.

La dernière ligne droite, la meilleure, t'as décidé d'analyser ma ligne de vie.
Elle cherche la ligne d'arrivée, mais la voyante a souligné qu'apparemment ma ligne dévie.
Alors ma ligne de vie rage, ma ligne de vie perd, mais la voyante ne la voit pas bien.
Elle a un air inquiet car la ligne est coupée, alors moi j'entends plus rien

Je lui demande si elle est sûre, elle scrute les interlignes.
Ce moment est inhumain,
Du coup elle va se faire une petite ligne,
Moi j'ai perdu mon avenir quelque part au creux de ma main.
Ça met un bout de temps mais on a retrouvé ma vie,
Elle avait juste sauté une ligne.

Quand la séance fut finie j'ai décidé de prendre soin de moi,
Et de faire attention à ma ligne.
Avant de quitter la voyante on s'est serré la main,
On a mélangé nos lignes.
Une chose est sûre je reviendrais pas demain,
Elle s'est vraiment plantée sur toutes les lignes.

Depuis, ma ligne de conduite est de viser la ligne d'horizon,
Pour voir plus loin que le bout de mes lignes,
Fini de lire dans les mains, maintenant je préfère serrer le poing.
Point à la ligne.",Les Lignes de la main

Grand Corps Malade,"J’aime bien la terrasse des cafés quand le soleil sourit
J’aime bien aussi la table du fond dans un petit bar pourri
J’aime bien lever mon verre juste en l’honneur de l’instant
Trinquer avec des inconnus quand personne ne m’attend

J’aime bien conduire le soir au moment où la nuit s’amorce
J’aime bien les paysages quand le soleil perd de la force
L’étrange humeur maussade, le crépuscule dans le ventre
Observer les détails quand chaque minute se réinvente

J’aime bien l’instant précis où gentiment la pluie s’arrête
Où l’éclaircie s’apprête, où on peut relever la tête
Regarder devant soi et s’étonner de voir plus loin
Imaginer l’avenir au moins jusqu’à demain matin

J’aime bien regarder la vue, prendre un peu de hauteur
Prendre le temps, prendre du recul, prendre les choses moins à cœur
J’aime bien faire une pause, penser à toi et sourire
Te sentir près de moi et te regarder dormir

Pause

J’aime bien me souvenir, j’aime bien parler d’avant
J’aime bien la nostalgie, ça me fait me sentir vivant
J’aime bien sentir le froid, j’aime bien ouvrir les vitres
J’aime bien le temps qui passe quand il ne passe pas trop vite

J’aime voir vivre les gens, les sereins et les stressés
Ceux qui prennent tout leur temps et ceux qui jouent les pressés
J’aime appartenir à tous ces mouvements d’humeur
Être au cœur de la foule et me sentir à l’extérieur

J’aime bien la ville la nuit, quand tu crois qu’elle est belle
Voir le monde à la merci de sa réalité parallèle
Toute la foule des fantasmes et des rencontres pas nettes
J’aime bien les faces B, effleurer l’autre planète

J’aime bien rêver d’autres vies et m’avancer vers elles
Y repenser pour comprendre ce que rêver révèle
J’aime bien faire une pause, penser à toi et sourire
Te sentir près de moi et te regarder dormir

Pause

J’aime les a priori pour qu’ils soient vite dépassés
J’aime bien les convictions quand elles se sentent menacées
J’aime sentir la fragilité dans certaines attitudes
J’aime bien les êtres humains qui n’ont pas trop de certitudes
J’aime bien garder le silence face à ceux qui parlent fort
J’aime la nonchalance, j’aime gérer mes efforts
J’aime bien écrire la nuit, au cœur de son ventre mou
J’aime bien parler tout seul mais ça, ça reste entre nous

J’aime bien ces soirées qui n’ont plus envie de s’arrêter
Quelques âmes autour d’une table à bavarder et profiter
De s’enfoncer dans la nuit, sans retenue, sans excès
On oublie presque qu’on est bien, on refait le monde sans succès

J’aime bien voir le soir, le sentir entre chien et loup
Flirter avec le cafard, me sentir entre rien et tout
J’aime bien aussi faire une pause, penser à toi et sourire
Te sentir près de moi et te regarder dormir",Pause
Grand Corps Malade,"Au temps jadis, fils, il fallait pour faire la cour,
Sortir sa plus belle plume et tenter quelques mots d'amours.
Transmettre la lettre, si possible loin des regards.
Ajouter du parfum sur le papier pour les ringards.
Aujourd'hui ça va plus vite, c'est la drague en digital.
Le smartphone pour pécho est devenu quasi vital.
Texto et Facebook sont les alliés de Cupidon.
Sans eux, t'es célibataire, t'es rien, t'es un bidon.
Tkt, j'te kiff, c'est trop LOL, mdr,
Abréviations, fautes d'orthographe, ouvriers de la langue de Molière.
Il suffit de mettre trois petits points derrière les mots ""à bientôt"",
Et on comprends tout de suite que tu veux jouer recto-verso.
Ça manque un peu de recherche et d'un brin de poésie,
Mais c'est plus efficace, merci à la technologie.
Car si tout va plus vite et qu'on se rencontre sans détours.
On ne peut que se réjouir, tant que les gens font l'amour.

Céline voulait Medhi, mais Medhi voulait Jennifer.
Séverine voulait Teddy, et Teddy préférait son frère.
Son frère lui ne désirait que les couguars athlétiques,
Aux lèvres gonflées, figées, la chirurgie est statique.
Katty a encore trompé son mari la semaine dernière.
Il a rien vu en séminaire avec ses deux jeunes secrétaires.
Ils étaient content de se retrouver après leur petites affaires.
C'est l’adultère salutaire, quand père et mère savent se taire.
Patrice aime bien les petites jeunes, qui aiment bien les petits vieux.
Alice aime jouer avec les hommes, qui aiment bien ses petits jeux.
Marie aime les galipettes avec plusieurs amis.
Puis Annie aime les sucettes, les sucettes à l'anis.
Ça manque un peu de sentiment, puis d'un brin de passion.
Mais ne soyons pas moralistes, acceptons toutes les infractions.
Car tant que les gens se font plus de bien, que de mal en retour.
On doit pouvoir s'en réjouir, tant que les gens font l'amour.

Le jour de son mariage Laurent avait bu trop de whisky.
Il se rappelait qu'il était marié, mais ne savait plus contre qui.
Steve et Fabienne ont tout quitté pour s'aimer toute leur vie.
Et ils vécurent peu heureux et eurent beaucoup d'ennuis.
La vanne, le jeu de mot, et la petite dose de cynisme accompagnent bien
Les situations qui manquent un peu d’héroïsme.

On s'fait une double peine, l'amour était en sursis
Et la sentence est ferme, j'ai pris un an avec soucis

Grand Corps Malade,"C’est moi qui tiens le p’tit troquet de ce côté-ci de la place
J’ai des clients fidèles, des piliers de bar et de terrasse
Je garde un mot et un sourire pour chacun d’eux, c’est mon métier
Mais je n’ai d’yeux que pour elle, c’est la plus jolie du quartier
Assise, les jambes croisées, de grands yeux verts comme des calots
Elle aime rester dehors et siroter sa menthe à l’eau
Mais c’est la fin d’après-midi et quand le soleil s’étire
Toute ma terrasse se met à l’ombre et je vois la belle partir

C’est moi qui tiens le grand café
De l’autre coté de la place
Quand vient la fin de la journée
J’récupère les clients d’en face
Car le soleil de 18 heures
Inonde mes tables et nos visages
Imaginez mon bonheur
Quand vient la plus belle du village

Oh, c’est la traversée
Oh, je la vois s’éloigner
Oh, c’est la traversée
Oh, je la vois s’approcher

Je reste muet les pieds cloués, les bras ballants, la mort dans l’âme
Car comme chaque jour, le soleil a réorienté ses flammes
Alors la belle m’a laissé là, seul dans ma peine et ma pénombre
Je vois sa silhouette rétrécir et s’éclairer dans l’autre monde

Je prends le soleil dans les yeux
Celui qui dessine les contours
De celle qui remplit tous mes vœux
L’amour s’approche à contre-jour
Puis elle s’assoie de toute sa classe
Croise ses jambes interminables
Elle est à moi sur ma terrasse
Je toise au loin l’autre minable

Mes yeux la suivent nerveusement, elle a repris une menthe à l’eau
Je vois le sourire arrogant du gars d’en face, le vieux salaud
Tant qu’le soleil se couche à l’ouest, je serai le perdant de ce jeu

Grand Corps Malade,"Je n'sais pas depuis combien de temps je suis assis sur ce banc
Une bonne heure ou vingt minutes, le spectacle est absorbant
J'observe les gens qui passent, moi je me sens à peine là
J'écoute le vent qui trace dans son murmure acapela
Rester assis sur un banc c'est tout un savoir faire
C'est maîtriser les mouvements qu'il faut savoir taire
C'est assumer et afficher son pouvoir de paresse
Le sentir comme une caresse, chasser les crampes qui apparaissent
Moi j'ai de bonnes capacités dans ma force d'inertie
Il faut savoir en profiter, pouvoir lui dire merci
Être assis sur un banc au beau milieu du décor
C'est être au cœur de la vie, mais surtout être en dehors
C'est de cette cachette ouverte que j'observe mon petit monde
Laissant agir à découvert la nonchalance qui m'inonde
Je n'sais pas depuis combien de temps je suis assis sur ce banc
Je regarde les gens pressés, et puis ceux qui font semblant
Face à cette scène de théâtre, je n'peux plus m'arrêter
Je savoure l'espèce humaine dans son immense variété
J'aime les vieux, les gros, les moches, les grandes gueules et les discrets
Les vénères, les beaux gosses, les précis et les distraits
Un enfant apparaît au loin, agitant un p'tit bâton
En plein combat féroce contre une bonne dizaine de dragons
Il se moque bien des regards dans son délire d'innocence
Et disparaît à toute allure, presque aussi vite que l'enfance
Une belle femme entre à présent dans mon champ de vision
De grands yeux clairs, un regard sûr, elle semble sourire sans raison
Je l'a regarde quand elle s'approche, elle marche avec délicatesse
Je l'a regarde quand elle s'éloigne pour admirer ses jolies tresses
Une autre revient des courses, elle est chargée comme une mule
Le visage fermé, le regard presque aussi triste que son pull
Elle porte tout le poids de la routine dans chacun de ses mouvements
À moins que ce soit l'poids des sacs, j'extrapole un peu surement
Mais regarder les gens passer c'est ne les connaître que vingt secondes
Il faut alors imaginer toute une histoire qui corresponde
Comme ces deux jeunes qui parlent en slave, surement des espions russes
Où peut-être juste deux étudiants en échange Erasmus
Alors j'arrête une minute de pousser mon imagination
Pour admirer le dernier style de la nouvelle génération
Des jeans slims et des coiffures comme dans les clips tard le soir
J'ai un peu d'mal à comprendre, j'crois que je suis en train de devenir ringard

Il va falloir que j'me relève, il va être l'heure de se retirer
Je jette un dernier regard panoramique pour m'inspirer
Y'a un vieux qui regarde devant et son p'tit fils qui regarde derrière
C'est peut-être un symbole d'un monde qui marche à l'envers
Je reprends ma route et mes projets, c'est qu'il y'a du pain sur la planche
On a des années à construire, des ambitions sur chaque branche
Mais chaque fois qu'il y'en aura marre de se vouloir trop exigeant

C'est l'heure du flow et des gros bras, et s'rappeler aussi que je viens d'là

A la face d'un monde hanté par un futur sans avenir

Pour faire couler une ancre honnête, avoir mal pour être soi-même
On essayera de se souvenir pourquoi on a commencé ça
Faut trouver l'urgence d'écrire, le plus important c'est ça
Être soi même malgré tout, naïf, décidé, bavard
On absorbera les mots en trop sur un bout d'papier buvard
On essayera de se souvenir qu'on a fait ça dans calculer

Et qu'ils pourront y grimper avec en poche cet héritage

Les premières nuits pointillées, les premiers vices de couche-tard
On a encore les Memory et les parties de dominos
Les jouets qui font trop d'musique et les matins trop matinaux
Les journées de taff' raccourcies, l'ultimatum de 16h30
Et les promenades au parc, tous les jours où ça leur tente
On continue de s'émerveiller devant un dessin d'cosmonaute
Ou un bonhomme pâte-à-modeler avec un bras plus grand que l'autre
On continue de vouloir filmer tous ces moments insensés

Les premières grosses engueulades et les punitions à contre cœur
Les premiers cadeaux débiles avec leur nom sur leur tasse
Les siestes d’un œil sur l’canapé en regardant Pocahontas

On attend sans impatience, les premiers devoirs à la maison
Les premiers stress de contrôle, les boules au ventre à l’horizon
Les premiers mots dans le carnet pour les tarés quand ils s’amusent
Les premières mauvaises notes, pour les carrés de l’hypoténuse
On redoute un peu quand même le cartable de 20 kilos
Cahiers à spirales, intercalaires, trousse qui déborde de stylos
Et puis il y'aura premier portable, les premières boums, premières soirées
Les premières peines de cœur, premier rencard un peu foiré
Ce sera un peu l’moment de toutes les grandes premières fois
Les premières cuites, les premières nuits qu’on ne nous racontera pas
On les regardera agir avec un pincement au cœur
Car de leur vie on deviendra de plus en plus spectateur
Il y'aura la première fois moins de 5 fautes au code de la route
Qui leur permettra de s’éloigner encore plus vite et puis sans doute
Suivra leur premier appart avec une Pocahontas bien élancée
Ils reviendront vider leur chambre, ça j’ose même pas y penser
Il nous restera ça je l’espère, ce sentiment essentiel
De les avoir bien préparé à cet immense bordel
Il nous restera ça j’en suis sur, cette indicible joie
De les voir courageux, bien épanouis dans leurs choix
Il nous restera une maison avec une ou deux chambres en trop
Retrouvant le statut de jeune couple en perdant celui de parents pro
Il nous restera à regarder devant en appréciant ce qu'il y'a derrière
Prendre pleins de photos de demain, pour compléter celles d'hier
Et puis les chambres en trop seront à nouveau amochées
Par la nouvelle génération des premiers jouets écorchés
Le cycle jouera son rôle implacable et fatidique
Et on retrouvera des jouets modernes qui feront toujours trop de musique
Au milieu des nouveaux cris on s'dira qu'on a réussi
À fabriquer ce manteau, qui nous protège la vie
Ce confort impalpable, ce tremplin, cette béquille
Ce miracle anodin, on a fait une famille

Grand Daddy I.U.,"Aight, let's go
Yo you
What's your response to the M-C's down there on the corner, man
Talkin' about doin' you somethin', man
What's up with that?

First of all, man
No M-C in the world can get with this, gee

Yeah, I know that, but you know
Well, this guy is talkin' that foolishness

I tell you what, gee
Yo, line em up

Turn on your radio, here we go again
It's time for the you to flow again
Mellow and smooth, blowin' cool like a summer breeze
Just like leaves from the trees, you dumb M-C's
Are gone with the wind
When I blow, you'll all end
So fasten your seat belt, sit back and hold on
Brace yourself and prepare to get rolled on
And I'ma take it to your death
Watch you scream till your very last breath
I get vexed and explode like a bomb
Catchin' more bodies than Vietnam
The mic's a fuse, and my brain is the dynamite
Ignitin' when type M-C's keep tryin' to write
Rhymes like you
You can't swing it, you're doo-doo
Talkin' a lotta stuff, but that's not enough
It takes action, and you ain't got enough
So when you come, bring a army
Even your mommy, and you still can't harm me
Cause fake M-C's, enemies, and foes
I just smack em and watch em fall like dominoes
(Back-slap ya all down like why'all were dominoes)

Who's the smoothest, that's the question
If you don't know, then keep guessin'
You're not sure? Well, here's a clue
It's one letter, the you
My technique and talent perplexes
While my rhyme flexes from here to Texas
Handsome and tall
You want to battle? Come one, come all
I crush your world while your girlfriend swings low
Get with this? Yo, I don't think so
So take a step to the back
What, is you stupid, or is it crack?
My brain flows and grows like a embryo
Suckers are frontin', but they don't really know
What damagin' a mic's about
One two three strikes, you're out
What I recite will ignite like sulfur
Bite, you might catch a ulcer
So take this advice for your personal safety
Drop your mic and get the hell away from me
'Cause enemies and foes
I just smack em and watch em fall like dominoes

Nice and easy, yeah, that's how it ought to be
If it ain't smooth, it ain't raw to me
Give me a mellow beat and a bass line
Rhymes combined make you move your waistline
So listen as the rhyme is said
But you don't have to dance, just bop your head
Daddy you's as smooth as smooth can get
Bodies movin', it proves that the groove's a hit
A vocal tone don't get no crisper
Loud and clear even if I whisper
So give me a slow pace, beat with a low bass
And pass the mic and I ain't goin' no place
I won't fatigue, take a pause, or retire
Energy flows to me from a microphone wire
Soon as it's plugged up, couples are hugged up
Touch the you? Boy, you must be drugged up
Cause fake M-C's, enemies, and foes
I just smack em and watch em fall like dominoes",Dominos

You figure my skill's gone then you dead wrong like child porn
I'm game tight, so never take my name light

On the mic, with the hands, or from the twelve gauge

What's next, I'm givin' your girlfriend rough sex
Like Underground I Get Around
And yeah I like SWV but I ain't tryin' to go Downtown
So come meet the Grim Reaper, the Crypt Keeper
Got force and just like Bo$$ I gets Deeper
I'm sick of hearing you actors on wax
Claiming you're breaking backs, you niggaz is fakin' jacks
I lay you dead in the ghetto streets, your head and my metal meets
You scream like steam when the kettle heats
So kid you better play the rear
Or like that five thousand dollar love seat
Your ass is Outta Here

[Verse Three: Grand Daddy I.U.]
Aiyyo the only remains is bloodstains spilled brains and broke bones
You step in my face with the games you get smoked homes
I come out blastin', doin' your whole ass in fast and
It's Daddy you the smooth assassin
My name spells defeat to punks on the street
I pack 'nuff heat, my rhyme flow is fatter than cellulite
I got a master plan to blast a man
Faster than niggaz can plea, it's disaster and
Mayhem and havoc on the scene
You see what I mean, when I bust the sixteen in your spleen
To get the third leg hoes beg
The skills are nastier than a fart after eatin' a bald egg
And yo to be quite precise I'm might nice
I got more high priced hookers than Heidi Floess
Kid you better check my rep
Or quiet as kept, you catch a hole in your neck, so watch your step

Little johnny hooker was a sissy on the street all his life --
All his natural born life.
Until his daddy took him aside and said,
""son, now here's your switchblade knife boy.""


He said ""get out in the street boy,
Cut yourself some meat boy.
Get out on your own side of the road,
And lighten my load.""


Johnny made a mistake and took his knife down to school one day.
Hey, yeah, yeah.
And, when the bell rang for lunch.
Freddie miller went and got in johnny's way boy.
He took his knife from his pocket, pushed a button on the side.
When he seen the queen steel,
You ought to seen the light in freddy's eyes.


Oh, yeah ...


Little johnny hooker learned his lesson from the knife now you see,
(yes he did.)
Because for what he done to fred he spent some time in a penitentiary.
It was a day in the courtroom, exhibit letter ""a.""
When the jury seen the knife they put little johnny's ass away.

And gettin' it back's so hard to do.

And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads

For a lead role in a cage?

You forgive me but then I return to my sin
I need forgiveness again

Oh Jesus it's useless for me to try harder
I pray and I promise but I just fall farther
All of my efforts just add up to nothing in the end
This frustration brings me back to you again

Aren't you the strangest friend there is?
They were yellin' ""Crucify"" you said ""Forgive""
When he was drivin' in the nails
You looked and saw someone you'd die to love
And I can't understand why this hammer's in my hand",Forgiveness Again
Grand Incredible,"I exist to do this it's on my wrist
I resist with both fist and I don't miss
You can run from wrath but you run from fact
There's no way back if you choose that path
All were bound but now some run free
in streets of mercy where you find me
Yes mercy streets where the lost walk found
And nail pierced feet tread holy ground

(Chorus)
Here We Go, we're closer than yesterday
Here We Go, where no soul is turned away
Here We Go, where pain is a memory
Here We Go, where I want to be right now

I'm livin' with death inside
Sin and righteousness side by side
Life is Christ and him crucified
I came alive when the old man died
While I'm here I now I must try
Tell the world that we all must die
We await the same fait the fool and wise
But nobody gets out of here alive

(Chorus)
There's hope for everyone",Here We Go
Grand Incredible,"Who's the greatest coach in the NBA?
Who's the smoothest cat to ever call a play?
Three three peats on his resume
What's his name? Phil Jackson and he coaches LA

Who's the greatest player in the NBA?
Nobody's better in the game today
The first KB is the new MJ
What's his name? Kobe Bryant number 8 for LA

The baddest big man that we've ever seen
Meaner than Wilt, George and Kareem
Number 34 but he's not the dream
What's his name? Big Shaq and he plays for our team

Who's the greatest team in history?
This century's first dynasty
If you ask me then I will say
That would be the Lakers and they play in LA",Los Lakers Por Vida
Grand Incredible,"Just think about the good things
Don't let any one or anything bring you down
Keep in mind who loves you all of us your sisters
And your mom and dad
But no one loves you quite as much as Jesus

Hold on little brother don't lose heart
You're still so young and you've come so far
Behold God's glory's eighteen years old
The most beautiful soul I know

If the weight becomes too heavy just call me up
And I'll come runnin' we all need friends
Cast your cares on Jesus
Remember me and I'll remember you when I pray
Kid just plug in your guitar and play

And I've learned more from you
Than any book I've read
And if I can help in any way at all don't hesitate",Most Beautiful Soul
Grand Incredible,"We were three points down with just seconds left
I hid my face and held my breath
It looked like Cwebb and Mike Bibby could
Overthrow our dynasty
Then Kobe drove but Kobe missed Shaq could not put
Down the tip Vlade slapped it out but it was still
Alive and it bounced right to number five

And oh the skies were grey but everything's ok
Robert Horry saved the day
There's sunshine in LA with one brilliant play
Robert Horry saved the day

He doesn't get commercial spots
He just hits game winning shots
Though they haven't made a Sports Century
He's a superstar to me
The Lakers are my favorite team
I love Magic, Wilt, West and Kareem
But one day in the rafters high
I hope they hang up number five",Robert Horry
Grand Incredible,"And this I know his teeth as white as snow

Hear the clock tickin'
I think of you
Caught up in circles
Confussion, there's nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after...
Sometimes you'll picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you say
And you say, go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

[Chorus:]
If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you
I will be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secret stolen
All from deep inside

And you say, go slow
I fall behind
The 808's on time

Grand Incredible,"I think about you all the time and I can see so many things
That I admire but then I think that she could never want me
You're beautiful and there's sometimes I kind of lose my mind
I can't think straight and my heart aches
I wonder if you'd ever want me

I'm not so bad do you think you could want someone like me

Just set aside a little corner of yourself
No I don't need to cal it mine
I just hope time to time you think about me
And I wanted to ask you if maybe we'd be more than friends
But courage quails and confidence fails
The words refuse to pass my lips

I think with grace and with love we can work through anything
It's only God's love that conquers everything

Don't be afraid we won't rush in
I'll make sure that we take it slow

You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love

Hidden by leaves and branches, 
We used to kiss so secretly.

Ninety to nothing, watch me run
You call
I am ashamed to say
Ugly girls know their fate
Anybody can get laid
You want a room with a fire escape
I want to tell you how much I hate this
Don't leave that stuff all over me
It pains me
Please, just leave it
I should toss that vanity license plate
Toss that make-up painted face
Box those poems, chocolate cake
Scratch that name on the record player
Please, just leave me be
Don't lay that stuff all over me
It crawls all over, all over me
Call my name, here I come
Your last ditch lay, will I never learn?
Caramel turn on a dusty apology
It crawls all over me
You turn all over
It pains me
Please, just leave it",Tongue
