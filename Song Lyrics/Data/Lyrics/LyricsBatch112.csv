Alkaline Trio,"I've waited a long time for this life
Just to ruin it, so please don't ruin this for me
Yes to understand this lie
Hell I crossed those t's
I scratched out all these eyes, myself last night
What I promise not to find

So this is what I'm looking like these days
I'm all grown up, so full of hate
But I don't wanna let go of my age
'Cause it's the salt, that brings the taste

So where am I to decide that I'm not right?
'Cause I might break and I might bend
Your heart strings out of tune again
And I might try to apologize
One a good day
On my best day
If you stick around

Did I stay inside to sterilize this knife?
Am I being to careful?
Does this seem right?
Did I open up the shades to expose these sunny rays?
To show what burned this sight

Take a close look
Hold me right up to the light
'Cause I might break and I might bend
Your heart strings out of tune again
And I might try to apologize
One a good day
On my best day
If you stick around

I've waited for so long
(I've waited for so long)
Spread me out, rake me in
This scorched and rocky field
Will camouflage my skin

And I might break and I might bend
Your heart strings out of tune again
And I might try to apologize
One a good day

On my best day
If you stick around [2x]",Ruin It
Alkaline Trio,"It's gonna rain like this for days,
I'm gonna drown in my old ways,
But I'm fine.
I'm fine.

It's gonna hurt like hell
When you pull back the hammer and fire,
But I'm fine
I'm fine.

You see a storm knocked out my super power,
Now I sleep through thundershowers.
Wake me when you learn to be cool.
If I'm the captain of this boat then all my shipmates are fools.
And all the the stars in the world couldn't help me steer my way out of this kiddie pool.

I'm gonna wake up from these dreams
With nightmares lined up on my street,
But I'm fine.
I'm fine.

Needed a hand to keep my head up
So you put hooks in both my ears,
And I'm fine.
I'm fine.

Yeah it's a chronic pain in my ass but no, it's not a burden.
It's ironic that I drink to make my insides stop hurting.
And it's love that gives me heartburn,
It's a song that makes my stomach turn,
And I wouldn't trade my hand for all the aces in the deck.

Cause I'm fine
Cause I'm fine
I'm fine
I'm fine
I'm fine
I'm fine",Fine
Alkaline Trio,"You hit me just like heroin
I feel you coursing through my veins
I once tried to kick this addiction
I swear I'll never kick again
Won't ever kick again, no

This addiction, can't seem to live without you
This addiction, no going clean
This addiction, I go through withdrawal without your
Sick with this addiction in me

Well those others were like methadone
I took to get me through the day
Now I'm trying to find my way back home
Staying clean along the way
Hold out for the real thing, yeah

Alkaline Trio,"Well they tied that yellow ribbon round the oak tree.
They've worn out all the prayer in their hearts.
All along thought they were routing for the home team,
As they're sent to the game and torn apart.

With twists this turn a kid up on the pipeline,
He carries all the pain in the world.
As we blindly clap and cheer from the sidelines
It's clear, on a losing streak from the very start

And that's where they found me,
In the cemetery.
A smoking gun in my hand,
Now I'm damned for the land of the free.
Sing with me,
The American scream.

They took that faded ribbon off the oak tree.
They've worn out all the hope in their hearts.
All along thought I was doing the right thing,
Now I'm lying in a pool of my blood.

And that's where she found me,
In the cemetery,
A smoking gun in my hand,
Now I'm damned for the land of the free.

Alkaline Trio,"Like two ships in the night,
We're colliding and sinking,
Into the black sea of our love.
We navigated past the point of logical thinking,
Lost sight of the stars up above.

Now my heart is a mess.
Murder scene in my chest,
Not a clue how you got through the door.
But I'm glad that you came,
No regret and no shame,
As I'm lying here dead on the floor.

I took a blind leap of faith,
That's now crashing and burning,
With my heart fast asleep in your bed.
I got on the ground safe
But with my insides turning,
And a picture of you in my head.

As I wandered away deep in shock and dismay,
In a daze, just repeating your name.
Well the fact of the matter is both our hearts
Shatter way too goddamn easily

When you asked me if I'd stay forever,
Guess you meant just for the week.
We felt so good together,
It was way too good to be.
When I left you there early that morning, my darling,
I told you that I'd miss you so.
I got on that plane with my heart soaring,
But now it's falling like snow.

And like two ships in the night.
We're colliding and sinking,
Into the black sea of our love.

Alkaline Trio,"Don't leave me alone
I'm waiting for this to be the last thing that I say
If I tried real good, bet I could
Get a couple more days but the drugs are lame
So I'm looking for you to be
The very last thing I see before I up and fly away
I'm counting on you to help push me through
With something good to remember on my red letter day

Don't worry, I only feel the good things
Let's dine, dine, dine my darling
Let's have our last supper as us,two lovers
Then we'll dance real sweet and slow
And then kiss, kiss, kiss,'til the last clock tick
A final exhale when I'm done
And you can keep my last breath floating in your lungs

I tried a lot of things just because of you
You make me tell the truth
You taught me to drink like a man
You rescued my tail from between my legs
Now if I can think it I am
And I'm taking these words with me
When go over to the other side
I'll be waiting on you, but don't show up to soon
I'll be bored as heaven but I'll be alright

So let's dine dine dine my darling
Let's have our last supper as us, two lovers
Then we'll dance real sweet and slow
And then kiss, kiss, kiss, 'til the last clock tick

Alkaline Trio,"Like the flutter of your fingertips,
Like the flickering of lights,
They've got their bright ideas but we've got bigger fish to fry.

Found you out there on your doorstep,
Undressed to the nines.
From your Sunday best, black and blue velvet dress.
Your head's a mess and so is mine.

Oh Dorothy, I'm coming home,
I hope you're waiting there.
I know times have been tough on you,
It's all downhill from here.
Oh Dorothy, inside that dreadful place deep in your heart,
It's beckoning, I'm racing to your doorway Dorothy.
Dorothy.

Like the scratching sounds of insects,
Beneath the blades and soil.
We'll begin the plot to get away,
To ends as black as oil.
Now it's pounding in the ear,
Left in left field for you to find.
Outside of your peripherals vision of this never ending night.

Oh Dorothy, I'm coming home,
I hope you're waiting there.
I know times have been tough on you,
It's all downhill from here.
Oh Dorothy, inside that dreadful place deep in your heart,
It's beckoning, I'm racing to your doorway Dorothy.

It's a strange world isn't it?
Such strange times to be living in.
I had a change of heart tonight,
When I watched her walk into the light.

Alkaline Trio,"Whatever happened to Wonderland?
And where'd Alice go? Oh.
I took a night train with knife in hand,
And cut out to the next show 
Back in her living hell.

I wish to dwell, I long to be,
In the blood and the guts 
With the birds of prey and the stinging of bees and bullets maybe.

Leaving heaven behind for good this time, the angels can keep it.
I've got a demon in mind and she's standing behind my dark secret.
Draculina.

Whatever happened to Wonderland?
No one really knows, no.
But Draculina had her teeth sinking deep in me,
From the get to the go, back in her living hell.

Oh Draculina.
Leaving heaven behind for good this time, the Angels can keep it.

Alkaline Trio,"Well I found you outside like a sunrise,
That melted my eyes from my skull.
As I turned into ash before for my sweet demise,
The end of me was so beautiful.

Well now you're stuck in my head like a love song,
That climbed to the top of the charts.
How the fuck can something be so wrong and so right?
All the wrong words but all the right parts.

And you can sit there and tell me that I didn't try,
And I can honestly tell you that I never lied.
I can't stand this dark feeling, the shark eating me up inside.
Eating me alive
Eating me alive

Well I found you out there in the moonlight,
In your eyes there were diamonds like stars.
I was bound by your father, the jewel thief,
That night as you said he was still behind bars.

Now you're stuck in my head like a love song,
The words I can never forget.
As I sucked on your neck for way too long,
And drained you of every last drop you had left.

You can sit there and tell me that I didn't try,
And I can honestly tell you that I never lied.
I can't stand this dark feeling, the shark eating me up inside.
Eating me alive.
Eating me alive.

Here lies a homicidal story, sad but true.
The time has come and gone but I'd do anything for you.

Alkaline Trio,"Choking slowly,
Broken hearted.
Don't look now,
Here's what you started.
And I swore I'd be there 'til the end,
We're bitter now but better friends.
I climbed out limbless to the ledge,
To bask in my last true regret.

Lay my heavy head here down to sleep.
Now pray to a abraxas for my soul to keep.
Lay my heavy head here down to dream.
Wake up with this lead poisoning.

Sobbing softly,
Lost and hollow.
This fever dream,
Tough pill to swallow.
I swore I'd be there 'til the end
You're better off your bitterness.
I climbed out lifeless to the edge,
I waved goodbye and leapt I

Lay my heavy head here down to sleep.
Now pray to abraxass first my soul to keep.
Lay my heavy head here down to dream.
Awaking to the blood and sweat and screams.

Woke up here on Monday morning,
This old treat on this dark corner,
Waiting here for what tomorrow brings.
Silver lake mercury mining,
This mistake no silver lining,
Waiting for a bullet train to bring me my lead poisoning.

Alkaline Trio,"I needed more wine,you needed more sleep.
We just fought, two hours and seven minutes.
Honestly, I'm surprised we made it.

I retired to my chair, I grabbed my new guitar.
But I can't make a sound, you could hear poisonous dreams dropping all around.
Like rain, but I can ride the storm out.
Because I'm like the junkie for your smart mouth.

See I'm so far off the map the sun is shining,
While it's raining and I'm draped in silver lining.
And I can row, row, row my boat back to shore someday.
So are you coming with me?
Anchors away.

I loosen my lips and the truth slips out.
Every ride on a fork tongue,
This twine of trust is unspun.
I can start to believe that's what you need from me.
So far from what I want for you but I'll lock it down and we'll make do.
You're right, there's only one real option,
And I'm here now so help me keep my voice down.

See I'm so far off the map the sun is shining,
While it's raining and I'm draped in silver lining.

And I hiss and I rattle and shed
And I encircle you like a piranha school
As you slowly find your way to shore

Well I'm piss and vinegar again,
And I needed this like a new hole in the head.
I'm hiding out in the drink,
But floating, waiting to sink,
My great white teeth into your sweet bones.

With an ache in my heart and a thorn in my side,
I got no where to run, no place left to hide.
I got a burning temptation like Clockwork Orange herbicide
Feels like it's raining all the time.

Well I'm piss and vinegar again

And at the end of the day,
Once it's all down the drain,

Alkaline Trio,"I remember a rooftop making out
Downstairs the cupboard screamed so loud
I waited so long for that night
Then I just turned away

And I know every street on the West Side
But I was lost, unfound, not right
Maybe there's something wrong inside

Now I've got nowhere to go, my hands is all that I've got
I'm so sorry for so many things, that I haven't said yet
This is the waiting room I spend my whole life in
They gave me a thousand hands so I could calm my sins
If I'm lucky, maybe I'll finish before the roof caves in

I lost my life on the first try
You found it miles down the line
A swollen face with three first names
You kiss the taste back in my tongue
You suck the smoke out of my lungs
And then we slept for days and days, and days
When we woke up, my heart had choked up
Had to say I love you way too soon
But right there on your couch you loved me too
Right there on your couch you loved me too

Nineteen and sober once or twice
I caught some junky's bad advice
Up to my eyes in others problems
Couldn't see I'd never solve them

I'm only skin and bone and piss and pills unknown
I took my lousy shot at public recognition
Could never pull the trigger if I wasn't shaking

Stand looking down
So many thoughts cloud my brain
As I think about their lives
If wishes could come true
I think of all the things I'd do

Each time I leave that wishing well
Because I'm not afraid to dream
I hold my head up high
I'm not afraid to cry
I think of all the things I'd do
If wishes could come true

(only wishes don't come true)
If only there were peace on Earth
If only justice walked in blue
(only wishes don't come true)
If only everybody cared
If only we could never say never:
(only wishes don't come true)
I think of all the things I'd do
If only we could work together
If wishes could come true

Each time I leave that wishing well
I hold my head up high
I've got a thousand wishes
And I'm not afraid to try
If wishes could come true
I think of all the things I'd do
I tossed a penny in the well
A useless gesture, just as well
I watched it fall

A penny for your thoughts -
Do you care at all?

All,"I live in a box. I live on a one way street, but I don't mind.
'Cause I live alone. Nobody has to share my home.
And if I could choose I might pick a bigger box
My home on the range is underneath my black hat
But that's all I'd change, until I get a credit card
Until I wake up
I will not be watching you so you should not be watching me
I've got what I need. I've got a car that doesn't work.

I've got blood to bleed. I've got a bar of soap. I've got shampoo too

I won the Nobel Prize. I made a thinner dime.
So I look like me but I smell like you.
You know I'll get my act together when I find the time
But right now I think that living is a place to lie down.

You see I rule the dirt, so I'm the king of this town.
I live in the dark. I live in the silence, and I can say
And if I could choose I might pick a darker void
My home on the range is somewhere in the closet,
That I see and hear how much more than the average bear
But that's all I'd change, until I get a bigger club

Until I wake up.
I will not be watching you so you should not be watching me
So here's what we've got. You tell me what I am.

I'll tell you what I am. We'll both scratch our heads
I'll tell you what I am not. You tell me what I'm not.
Like we give a damn. Please tell me who comes out ahead
Was it me or you? Was it me or you? (probably you)
I live in my skull. I'm under my eyelids. You can't touch me.

'Cause I'm fast asleep. You wouldn't like the friends I keep.
But that's all I'd change, until I get a safe way out.
And I could choose I might pick a larger head
And don't you dare wake me up.My home on the range is right behind my eyeballs.

All,"My pappy said ""Son your gonna drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop driving that hot rod Lincoln""

Have you heard the story of the hot rod race
Where the Fords and the Lincolns were setting the pace?
Well that story is true cause I'm here to say
I was driving that model A.

It's got Lincoln motor and its really souped up
And that model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders, uses them all
It's got overdrive, just won't stall

It's got a four barrel carb, and dual exhaust
With four, eleven gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared
Breaks are good, tires fair

Pulling out of San Pedro late one night
With the moon and the stars just shining bright
We was headed up grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still

All of a sudden, in the wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said ""Boys this ones marked for me""
But by then the tail lights was all you could see

Now the fellas rid me for being behind
So I thought I'd let that Lincoln unwind
Took my foot of the gas and man alive
I shoved it on down into over drive

Wound it up to 110
My speedometer said I hit top end
My foot was glued like lead to the floor
And that's all there is, and there ain't no more

Now the boys all thought that I'd lost my sense
Those telephone poles were like a picket fence
They said ""Slow down, I see spots!""
The lines on the road just looked like dots

Took a corner, side swiped a truck
Crossed my fingers just for luck
My fenders was clicking the guard rail post
The guy beside me was white as a ghost

We had smoke coming from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
I knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass
But don't you know by then we'd be low on gas

I had flames coming from out of the side
Feel the tension, man what a ride
I said ""Look out boys, I've got a license to fly""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by

All of the sudden she started knocking
Down in the dips she started rocking
I looked in the mirror. Red lights were blinking
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln - Damn

The arrested me and they put me in jail
Called my pappy to throw my bail
And he said ""Son, you're going to drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop driving that Hot Rod Lincoln""

All About Eve,"Do you feel so small
On Sunday afternoon
In your loveless house
Full of empty rooms

Once a place of life
Once upon a time

While ghosts move in

Crossing on the stair
Asleep in empty chairs

And if we believe wisdom comes with years
As knowledge stings our eyes
The easier the tears
Cradled in the sadness, a heart that ever aches

I'm praying with all mine
I won't make the same mistakes
Are the dark seeds there
In the blood we share

Tell me... are you lonely ?

While love lives, while suns set
While snow moons rise in November skies
While ties bind while souls cry
While oceans ride in an endless tide

While love grows, while blood flows

Is giving up the ghost

All About Eve,"She saw that he closed the door
She stole a look in the guarded book
His prose was a line of crows
On a washing line in the summer time
And the wind blew the crows around
Some made the sky, some hit the ground
She never heard a fuller sound
It comes as no surprise;

She's in love with the dreamer,
So in love with his world.

He had songs you could sing along to
In any time, in any key.
They were jewels in Elysian pools
In eternity for all to see
And the water helped the jewels to shine,
Some like the stars and some like wine

In the eyes of earthbound angels
It comes as no surprise

He makes her close her eyes, 
He helps her paint the skies blue.

When the dreamer broke the seventh seal
And butterflies all lost their wheels

The day it rained forever
And you were wondering
If I held dreams of wedding rings

Beside the fireside but I'm sure I lied

All About Eve,"Late last night, about a quarter to twelve
In the middle of an awful storm
I took fright at the terrible sight
Of a raven flying into my room
My blood ran cold, my heart stood still
As I pulled the covers over my head
A minute dragged by as I opened my eyes up
To find her at the end of my bed
Then she spoke in a devilish croak
About herself being one of a score
And I felt sick at the very idea
Of dealing with nineteen more
She said, ""look out your window""
I see a skyfull, I pull a rifle on them all
Pink sunrise in the wintry skies
All warm on the wings of a dove
She sinks and lands on the back of my hand
And sings with the voice of love...
""Thoughts made flesh can be beautiful things
As I am one of the same
Fed so well on the best of your dreams
And the beauty found within
But those black beasts that you see in the east
Are scratching on the orchard floor
At split, sweet fruits and the writhing worms
That you keep behind the straining door
Go to the cellar!

Feasting on it
Fill my head with small white flowers
Help the sweetness heal the sour
Draw on high religious power

Outside his business hours

You know, where were you
When I needed you to
Hold me, give a little beat of your heart to me
You've got to hold me, it's like the rhythm of life to me

How I long to take some comfort
From your arms
I am denied

On the comfort or charity of strangers

Dearer than life.

Of a soldier of tin

All About Eve,"Madeleine hears the bohemians say
She's selfish and crazy
Which isn't so far from the truth
She's the essence of youth

She raises a glass to your art

And give it me, please
Give me the ocean, give me the sea
Gather up everything I ever wanted
And share it with me

How many poets are driven
To drink and to verse

Rarified air
Where all the shiny black birds of the west
Make a rest in her hair?
She raises a glass to your love

I lost my way but I found something out

All About Eve,"The grey of winter falls on us -
How will our garden grow ?
Will all the seeds we've sown
Survive beneath the snow ?
We've been here before,
Wrapped in our regret.
All those winter words,
I want us to forget them

Seasons may change 
And they hold wild flowers,
Raising their face to the sun.
All that are born from our soft rainshowers
Are wild flowers.

Morning breaks
And no-one wakes;
No bird is here to sing.
So, from the south I wish them back
To brace the spring.
They've flown south before,
It's just the way they live.
For when I try to fly away
Can you forgive me ?

Seasons may change and they hold wild flowers",Wild Flowers
All About Eve,"Sleeping in, in case I miss you
Dreaming takes me right there to you
Quilt of silver golden thread
Your face is shining in my head

Waking up I see you slipping
Don't disappear, quench your thirst there
Ace of hearts, stolen diamond
Skylark singing, church bells chiming

The sudden sight of you is pleasing
It's only perfect things we're seeking
My heart's awake, my fear is sleeping
You I'm forever keeping

Forever, forever

My mood is cracked, I start to tremble
Splintered tears to re-assemble
I'm not able to express it
But I'm sure that I will get it

Lazy is the sleepy summer
I melt myself and drip upon her
Now we're liquid mixed together
Oh we can last forever

Forever, forever

I am focusing my actions
Pressing on with this attraction
If arrows fly then I will catch them

Oh it's you forever good time

For the books you read.

Where my tongue trips and curls and you kiss like a girl.
It frees me, frees me from the freeze.
And with the liberation everything's
Taken higher ; and every complication,
Another spark for the fire. you're nothing
More than eighteen but you are more than
You seem to be. 
You'll win me with pale
White hands and soft demands and ways

Eats the vegetables, joins their family

Helps the medicine go down

A fall of snow and the afterglow.

I think it must be the wine,

Or a heartache,
It must be the time of year.

Behold this metropolis, gold, throw ya hands in

I see her so clearly now, she's right there before my eyes

Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer)
She got me wander'n now
Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer)

5 foot 8 on the late what a date, she fell for the hook and the bait,
I took her to the yacht, the shrimp and steak
Then I took her to the gym so she could get in shape
No more drama, just late night thrills
Nigga in the hood with the gangsta grillz
Fillin out stacks of bills, jaguar like Jacksonville,
Bringing these hoes like Jacks and Jill

[Chorus]

[Akon]
I'm looking at the most beautiful thing in the world (world, world, world)
Her body's so perfect and spinning like a cinnamon swirl (swirl, swirl, swirl)
She looks like a fairy tale, but yet feels so natural (natural, natural, natural)
This one's a beast, but way to wonderful to be compared to an animal
She's like what I'm sipping on Shirley temple on ice,
She makes it just right,
That extra grenadine got me feelin' so nice
Her bodies so tight up under that light,
I see her so clearly now, she's right there before my eyes

Hey I sit and gaze hazy eyed as I day dream
Her n her girls on the stage doing they thing
Double D's full of silicon and saline
She thirty but look only a day over 18
Her booty big enough to swallow up a g-string
Hey going put that ass on me like a bee sting
Hey let the King on, beat it like a tambourine
And peel ya out ya jeans and eat it like a tangerine
I see her face down, ass high
Make everybody throw that cash high,
Back in the club already
She stuck in my head since last night,
That's right, girl you got my dreams so,
Sexy when I sleep,
No more fantasies I want the real thing.

Never ever ever serve a nigga where ya sleep at
Police be at ya door nigga you ain't tryna see dat

See my suicide watch stay on suicide watch
Kill yourself, yeah dem suicide rocks
Had the nerve to write me a Dear Young letter
Killin' 'em young, you shoulda known better

Let the swag do the talking, I don't say too much

Young live on da track

I don't chase no broads, I chase money and vodka
Next time I re up, I'ma buy me a chopper
And I ain't talking da AK, I'm talking shit wit propellers
Fly to the club make my old bitch jealous

Thug motivation, it's a straight celebration
I seen Jizzle in his chopper outside central station
This ain't a mixtape, but the tapes mixed
Black tape, grey tape all on one brick

Get it on the flo, get get it on the flo
Last night I swear to God half a million on the flo
Fell asleep on the money like a pillow on the flo
Woke up countin' money had to get it off the flo

What you know about 20 grand? Stuffed in a white sock
Pull off in a white drop like I play for them White Sox
Play wit them white rocks, play wit them white squares
You call it what you want, who the fuck cares?

I don't never sleep, why? Too paranoid
State of paranoia, all I do's call my lawyer
Tell him I know a nigga that might have a little trouble
Ok, you know it's me if you beat it I'll pay ya double

y'all niggas know it,s me, if I want 2 I'll make it double
Just know it's water whipped so you might have a little trouble
Might move a little slower, might get a few complaints
Say he ran out of gas, he might need a half a tank

Thank God it's Friday, fresh off the highway
Say he 2 minutes out, he 'bout to pull in the driveway
In the driveway, take the work out
Cut the duck tape, take the work out
Young!

I keep tryin' to tell y'all man
Y'all need to find y'all own style homie!
We do this, we been doin' it for years
Who dat? We dat

I watch the sunlight dance across your face

That all they do is sit and think my name
When all that I do is mainly
Sit and think about my baby and me

I really only felt that I could sing or rhyme
Under the impression that this is a mic
Making sure every dance step is right

Way up in the mirror singing five star songs
I wanna be shy cah
So I'm keep it real only doing what I know
Writing phat beats and keeping the flow

If you don't know what I know, you won't know
If you feel how I feel, I feel you
If you see what I see come and see me
If you hear what I hear, you know me

I know you like my style but do you like my flow?
(Huh?)
I know you wanna get with me but have you got soul?
(What?)

No money in my pockets would you take me as I am?
(Who?)
And if I wasn't beautiful would you be my man?

From Monday to Sunday
I'm just working on my beats
So if you don't know what I know
That's no good to me

Hear the music, don't you lose it
Let it take control
When I see you've got it right
Then I'll let you know, let you know

We don't care y'all 'cause our pockets are fat
Well actually girls no they're not
But at least you get to be on Top Of The Pops

We done plastic, platinum, silver, gold
Do you really wanna know how many records we've sold?
Let me tell you what other girl bands say

When I was young nobody kissed my, huh
I was the skinny kid at the back of the class
But now I've got curves shapely and strong

Every man, some women, wanna give me some more
I don't do that 'cause it ain't my thing
If you wanna piece of this, gimme gimme the thing

If you don't know what I know, you won't know
If you feel how I feel, I feel you
If you see what I see, come and see me

Here's not to what was me and you 
Here's not to all the day's gone by

The day I left my mother and my father and my sister
Lookin' for a job to pay the rent and buy my dinner
I found it so boring

You see my life revolved around a long term lover
Music was the same I had no time for any other.....interest
This was my whole life

""You can't sing, [Mel & Nat] if you want to make a living
Stop dreaming"", [Mel & Nat] as a little girl I would listen to them say
I just kept smiling
Oh now I'm a sing it now!

One two what's a girl to do'
I said 3, 4 I'm gonna laugh some more (can you hear me laughing')
I'm gonna 5, 6 get in the stitch
You'll never know you'll never ever break me baby

One two what's a girl to do'
I said 3, 4 I'm gonna laugh some more (its just so funny)
I'm gonna 5, 6 get in the stitch
You'll never know you'll never ever break me baby

Now times have changed I found myself involved with another
Still tryin' to forget the game without goin under....slowly
Yet I'm still gooooooooin (still going)

I can't believe the way some people want to stomp on others
Tryin' to take away a sense of pride, must be fulfillin'
If you got no feeling

You can't sing [Mel, Nat & Nic]
I thought I already told y'all that
Stop dreamin' [Mel, Nat & Nic]
Now get yourself back into class
Can't you see what ever you are trying to achieve rewards in nothing'

As I laugh Haaa Haaaa (Ha ha, ha ha ha) [Mel, Nat & Nic]
You can kiss my ass
All you guys thought I'd live a nonexistent life
That's right you thought I might not make it on my own
Got my own car, gold cards, I own my own home

Got to be effective, livin'' my dreams (Ha ha, ha ha ha) [Mel, Nat & Nic]
Those inhibitions I had to achieve
Try to ruin me you can't pull me down
So I'll prove you wrong and sing my song
When you pass I'll do a laugh

As you bring me down (ha ha ha ha I start to laugh a little louder baby)
I just laugh out loud (start to laugh a little harder honey)
You still on the ground (ha ha ha if you still on the ground)
As I laugh out loud (can you hear me')

To shape us and make us keepers of fellow man

We are not creatures made to be alone
And when we act as such, we help our brothers to stand

The city's looking like a ghost town
On a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield
There's a storm moving in
He's heading back from somewhere
That he never should have been

And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

Every light is burning
In a house across town
She's pacing by the telephone
In her faded flannel gown

Hoping she's not right
Praying it's the weather
That's kept him out all night

And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

The thunder rolls
And the lightning strikes
Another love grows cold
On a sleepless night
As the storm blows on
Out of control
Deep in her heart
The thunder rolls

She's waiting by the window
When he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him
Thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain
A strange new perfume blows
And the lightning flashes in her eyes
And he knows that she knows

And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls!

And the lightning strikes

To the bedroom door

Kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror

Celebrated memories that came and went
In light of all that time we spent
Listening to everything our parents told us not to take in

Now make a change, I'm counting down
The mile marks to every town
And falling more in love
With the distance put between us

We can't hide, we let go
We've got more than we know
My friends are a different breed
My friends are everything

Make this last, take it slow
We've got it all figured out for now
So, let us live our lives without a doubt

Tonight we lie awake
Remember how the coffee made us shake
On those long drives?
One more long night

Another seven days
Heartbeat racing the interstate, my home tonight
For one more long night

From coast to coast I'll make the most
Of every second I've been giving with this crowd
Without a doubt, you're all I dream about

At night we lie awake
With stories taking us back
To the nights we felt alive

I won't forget the good times
While the punks started picking fights
With the skater kids under city lights
Remember how we laughed 'til we cried
I won't forget the good times

But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

We were bare-knuckled, tight lip
Middle fingers up, ego trip
Devil may care but we didn't mind
I won't forget the good times
We're the boys in black smoking cigarettes
Chasing girls who didn't know love yet
As the bonfire moon came down
I won't forget the good times

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

When we laughed
When we cried
Those were the days
We owned the nights
Locked away
Lost in time
I found the nerve
To say that

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

I never want to leave this sunset town

And greed will not pay
God speed this bright millennium on its way
Let it come someday

Someday our fight will be won then
We'll stand in the sun then
That bright afternoon

Till then, on days when the sun is gone
We'll hang on
And we'll wish upon the moon

There are somedays, darken rivers
Say we haven't got a plan
But I'm praying for something better
Is the one thing we all share

Someday, when we are wiser
When the world's older
When we have learned
I pray someday we may yet
Live to live and let live

Someday life will be fairer
Need will be rarer
Greed will not pay
God speed this bright millennium

Let it come
We will shall find a moon
One day someday soon

One day, someday soon",Someday [Album Version]

Another illusion I chose to create
You don't know what you got until it's gone
And found out a little too late

I was acting as if you were lucky to have me
Doin' you a favor I hardly knew you were there
But then you were gone and it was all wrong
I didn't know how much I cared

Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
But I don't want to
Living without you
Is all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier
It's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to ya baby
You're a hard habit to break

You found someone else you had every reason
You know I can't blame you for runnin' to him
Two people together but living alone
I was spreading my love too thin

After all these years
I'm still tryin' to shake it
Doin' much better they say that it
Just takes time
But deep in the night it's an endless flight
I can't get ya out of my mind

All-Star United,"The question isn't whether it's true
The question, ""Is it working for you?""
Marshmallow skies and custardy pies
And nothing's too hard to do

They're five happy verses or so
They told me all I needed to know
Ignore all the rest, trials and tests
And threats to my comfort zone

Well, I've got no time to find out what's real
I stick with what I happen to feel
It feels grand
When you're livin' in La La Land

You can name a blessing yourself
Stake a claim on power and wealth
And strong healthy teeth, a spot at the beach
And romance that's really swell

All the saints and martyrs alive
Well, they would have called a national strike
Demanded less pain, more personal gain
If only they'd known their rights

Well, I take it very personally
Yeah, I got to know, what's in it for me?
Ain't it grand when you're livin' in La La Land?
Ain't it grand when you're livin' in La La Land?

I've got my prayer cloth collection and a Jesus jar
I've got the Holy Ghost ridin' in the back of my car
Sometimes He gives a little tickle I go, ""Hardee har har""
Ain't it grand when you're livin' in La La Land?

My Jesus decal does quite a trick
Right above my dashboard I stick it
A good luck charm, it keeps me from harm
And saves me from speeding tickets

Well, I take it very personally
Yeah, I got to know, what's in it for me?
Ain't it grand when you're livin' in La La Land?
Ain't it grand when you're livin' in a La La Land?

With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground
Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, daddy's within earshot, save the buckshot, turn up the band

Oh cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright

He says, dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone, watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance

And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride
Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin' backyard bombardier
Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and asked him which was the way back home
He said, take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then, boy, you're on your own
And now in Zanzibar, a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car, hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said, blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon

At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on highway nine,
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line

It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young

I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines

We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
H-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild
Babe I want to know if love is real

Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors

Allan Holdsworth,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire

Turning away from all regret
Tonight saying ""Goobye""

And in fancy 'neath a distant moon
You and I will drift upon a blue lagoon

On Blue Venetian Waters together we will dream
On Blue Venetian how lovely 'twill seem

Starlight tumbling down you shall wear
As a silver crown for your hair

The blue Venetian moonlight will soon light our way
Your eyes will tell me secrets your lips dare not say

So I'm qualified to say

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Dear Little Butterball,

I promised I'd try it,
Yet somehow my weight would not budge
Each Metrecal cookie
To me tasted cookie,
So I covered it with hot fudge

I ate watercresses,
And other such messes,
And pushed all my favorites aside
I said to the caterers,
""No more mashed potaterers,
Just baked, and hash browned, and french fried""

All you really need is skin
Skin's the thing that if you got it outside,
It helps keep your insides in

It covers your nose,
And it's wrapped around your toes

And outside ya hang your clothes

Skin is what you feel at home in
And without it, furthermore,
Both your liver and abdomen
Would keep falling on the floor

Don't upset their apple cart
Do not be a spy, you're not the FBI
And you should never break an aardvark's heart

To be an aardvark is not easy, folks,
'Cause all you get to eat is ants

And all the other animals make jokes
At your attempts to find romance

Nobody laughs at hippopotamuses,
Or at fat rhinoceroses,
But an aardvark makes them howl

He's like a kangaroo in love with a gnu,

Allan Sherman,"Once I had a secret code,
Where A was be	, and be	 was G.
G was K, and K was J;
And J was M, and M was P.

V was X, and X was V,
And you was I, and I was U.
87 stood for Z,
And 2 for T, and T for 2.

O was 12, and Q was 17;
I still don't know what those numbers mean.
That is how we won the war;
My secret code's no secret anymore.

H was 9, and S was 33;
Oh, how that confused the enemy!
Then a recent survey showed
That I don't understand my secret code.",Secret Code
Allan Sherman,"That old back scratcher has me in its spell,
That old back scratcher like the Chinese sell
Your plastic fingers up and down my spine,
The same old itchcraft when your touch meets mine
You tame that tingle when I'm all alone;
For I am single, so, to itch his own

So down and down you go,
Around and around and around you go
Scratching my unreachable zone

I should throw you away,
But I never do
I must give in to itchy skin
A skin with such a burning desire
When I'm scratching low,
The itching gets higher

Oh, you're the scrubber that placated me,
That chased each place that irritated me
And then, last night, you broke my heart
Because I sat down on you,
Two hundred pounds on you,
Then, snap, crack,
Everything just went black
My wonderful old back scratcher fell apart

Yes, you broke in half,
And now you're too short
I tried Scotch tape as a last resort
But with Scotch tape it wasn't the same
The thrill that was wild is suddenly tame

But, Old Man Sorrow will not get me down
I leave tomorrow night for Chinatown
For I must follow Heaven's plan
Around and around I'll go,
Through Chinatown I'll go,
Hoping to find another one just like you,

Allan Sherman,"Chim chiminey, chim chiminey, chim-chim-cheree
Those are three words that don't make sense to me
But I'm used to words that don't make sense to me,
From all those commercials I see on TV
When I see an ad that can't be understood
I know that the product has got to be good
Those words may be crazy, but I think they're great,
Like sodium acetylsalicylate
(Sodium acetylsalicylate)

I wake up each morning a most happy man,
I cover my Pic-O-Pay with Fluoristan
I add Hexachlorophene, 'cause it's so pure,
And then GL-70, just to make sure
Then I take a shower, but never alone
I'm in there with Dermasil and Silicone
I brush Vitrol-D on my Lanolin wave,
And I sharpen my Boo-boop, and use it to shave
(He sharpens his Boo-boop, and that's how he shaves)

There's Tufsyn, and Retsyn, and Acrylan too,
And Marfac and Melmac and what else is new?
There's Orlon and Korlan, and there's Accutron,
And Teflon, and Ban-Lon, and so on and on
These wonderful words spin around in my brain
Each one is a mystery I cannot explain
Like what does that Blue Magic whitener do --
Does it make blue things white, or make white things blue?

My Fastback has Wide-Track and Autronic Eye,
Which winks when a cute little Volvo goes by

It's nice, but oh my, how it hurts when I laugh
My chair is upholstered in real Naugahyde
When they killed that nauga, I sat down and cried

I'm giving a party next Saturday night
And here are the friends that I'm going to invite:
The giant who lives in my washing machine,
That other nice giant, who's jolly and green
The tiger who causes my gas tank to flood,
That handsome white knight who is stronger than crud
The man with the eyepatch, who sells me my shirts
And that nut who flies into the front seat for Hertz
(That daring young nut who goes flying for Hertz)

I've lived all my life in this weird wonderland
I keep buying things that I don't understand,
'Cause they promise me miracles, magic, and hope,

Allan Sherman,"I would like to explain how it came to pass that I got fat

Ladies and gentlemen, I got fat as a public service when I was a child, 
My mother said to me, 
""Clean the plate, because children are starving in Europe"" 
And I might point out that that was years before the Marshall Plan was ever heard of 
So I would clean the plate, four, five, six times a day, 
Because somehow I felt that that would keep the children from starving in Europe 
But I was wrong They kept starving and I got fat

So I would like to say to every one of you who is either skinny or in some other way normal
When you walk out on the street, and you see a fat person, 
Do not scoff at that fat person 
Oh no! 
Take off your hat, hold it over your heart, lift your chin up high and in a proud, 
Happy voice say to him,

""Hail to thee, fat person! You kept us out of war!""","Hail To Thee, Fat Person"
Allan Sherman,"When you're driving through the desert, and your car runs out of gas,
Lotsa luck, pal, lotsa luck
When you try to stop some strangers they will holler as they pass,
Lotsa luck, pal, lotsa luck
So you walk eight miles, and all uphill, to call the Auto Club,
And the whole thing's nip and tuck
'Cause they'll ask you for your number, and your number's in your wallet, 
And your wallet's in your car, so lotsa luck

When your television set breaks down and needs repairin' bad,
Lotsa luck, pal, lotsa luck
You look through the Yellow Pages for an honest-looking ad
Lotsa luck, pal, lotsa luck
Then the fellow comes, and says your set must go into the shop,
And he takes it in his truck
Four months later when he brings it back, it's someone else's set, 
Besides he drops it down the steps, so lotsa luck

Some people think a horseshoe's gonna bring them lots of luck
A horseshoe is a luck charm, of course
But for every set of horseshoes human beings use for luck,
Somewhere in this world's a barefoot horse (a barefoot horse)

When you buy a tape recorder of the automatic kind,
Lotsa luck, pal, lotsa luck
If it's simplified for folks who aren't mechanically inclined,

And on page one you get stuck
It says, if unsatisfactory you must bring this to the factory,

Allan Sherman,"My daughter needs a new phonograph.
She wore out all the needles.
Besides, I broke the old one in half.
I hate the Beatles.

She says they have a Liverpool beat.
She says they used to play there.
Four nice kids from offa the street.
Why didn't they stay there?

What is all the screaming about?
Fainting and swooning.
Sounds to me like their guitars
Could use a little tuning.

The boys are from the British Empire.
The British think they're keen.
If that is what the British desire,
God Save The Queen.

No daughter of mine can push me around.
In my home I'm the master.
But when the British come to town,
Gad, what a disaster.

Little girls in sneakers and jeans.
Destroyed the territory.
'Twas like some of the gorier scenes
From The West Side Story.

Of course my daughter had to go there.
The tickets are cheap, she hollers.
I was able to pick up a pair
For forty-seven dollars.

When the Beatles come on stage,
They scream and shriek and cheer them.
Now I know why they're such a rage,
It's impossibe to hear them.

Ringo is the one with the drum,
The others all play with him.
It shows you what a boy can become
Without a sense of rhythm. 

There's Beatle book and T-shirts and rings,
And one thing and another.
To buy my daughter all of those things,
I had to sell her brother.

Back in 1776
We fought the British then, folks.
Parents of America,
It's time to do it again, folks.

When they come back, here's how we'll begin,
We'll throw 'em in Boston harbor.
But please, before we toss 'em all in,

Allan Sherman,"He stood four foot eight
And wore a beatnik beard
He had big thick glasses
That looked real weird
He weighed ninety-eight pounds
But a whole nation feared
The rebel!

He had a chick named Rhonda
A college prize
Her hair hung down
Over her eyes
Kinda half Barbra Streisand
And half Joan Baez
She dug the rebel!

Well, they met one day
At a pop art bash
Between a painting of a can
Of succotash
And a high camp sculpture
Of a pile of trash
It was groovy!

Rhonda dug the rebel
And the rebel dug Rhonda
So she grabbed her guitar
And rode off on his Honda
To a discotheque
Called the Anaconda
With the Rebel!

When the frugging was over
At the discotheque
The Rebel was a-tryin'
To pay his check
But his pockets they were empty
So he yelled, ""Oh, heck!""
""Heck,"" said the rebel
Well, the Dean walked by
Just as that occurred
He said, ""You can get expelled
For what I just heard
Don't you realize 'heck'
Is a four-letter word
You rebel?!""

But the rebel said
To his old adversary
""Just as long as that word's
In the slang dictionary
I swear by Peter
Paul & Mary
I'll use it!""

""Furthermore,"" said the rebel
""I won't let the issue pass
The whole student boby's gonna
Sit down en masse
Besides, that way
We don't have to go to class
We're gonna clew it!""

Well, the sit-in started
'Bout 7:15
The whole thing was covered 
By Time magazine
They even took Batman
Off the TV screen
To show the rebel!

Out came the captain
Of the state police,
Arresting lots of students
For disturbing the peace
Including his own son
His daughter, and his niece
And the rebel

Someone called the governor
To see what he could do
The governor said, ""Sorry
But I cannot talk to you
'Cause I'm a-sittin' in
At the state house too
Just like the rebel!""

Soon the secondary schools
Began to rebel
Kindergarten kids were sitting
During show and tell
Then the older generation
Started sitting down as well
Man, what a protest!

Doctors sat, firemen sat
Teachers wouldn't teach
People sat at home
And on the street and on the beach
Jus a-sittin' and a-waitin'
For freedom of speach
Nobody was talkin' to anybody!

The nation was in trouble
There wasn't any doubt
The President went on TV
To try to pull us out
And the President shouted
""What the heck's it all about?!""
""Heck,"" said the President!

Soon everyone was saying ""heck""
They said it everywhere
And the rebel said to Rhonda
""This is terribly unfair
Being hip is getting middle class
Let's you and I be square""
And the did, they squared it up

Rhonda got a haircut
The rebel shaved his beard
They were married and had children
Which they subsequently reared
They moved out to the suburbs
And they really disappeared
Wow, did they conform!

Folks built a statue of the rebel
Just to prove the people's love
But the public soon forgot it
Just the pigeons up above
Seem to know the right location
They've all found that statue of

On the streets of Miami
I said to myself
This is some fancy town

I called up my partner
And said, ""Hello, Sammy
Go pack up your satchel
And mosey on down""

I got me a bunk
In the old Roney Plaza
With breakfast and dinner
Included of course

Then I rented a pinto
From Hertz Rent-a-Horse

On a non-scheduled airline

Such a pale-looking man

I recognized him
From his receding hairline
He recognized me
From my beautiful tan

Twas then that I heard
Fighting words from my partner
He said, ""Marvin, the Roney is no place to stay

I'm going to the Fontainebleau
Partner, it's mod'ner
And I'll charge to the firm sixty dollars a day""

He'll charge to the firm sixty dollars a day

You hanker for trouble
With the company checkbook
You quick on the draw""

He smiled and said, ""Stranger,
For me that goes double
'Cause west of the Fontainebleau
I am the law""

Next morning
The whole Lincoln road was deserted
And somewhere a hi-fi was playing a tune

'Cause everyone knew
Someone's gonna be murdered
In a duel in the sun

With my trusty revolver

Sigmund Freud, he had an unfurnished house
He was a very nosy fellow, so it seems
He had no chairs,
So he made all his friends stand around all day,
And tell him all their secrets and their dreams
Well, while they stood there talking 'till they got fallen arches,
They yelled, ""My feet are killing me, ouch!""
I said, ""Sigmund, don't you realize you've got a gold mine here
Go out and buy yourself a leather couch""

Alexander Graham Bell was building a fence
With some wood, and a long piece of wire
He said, ""There's something strange going on around here
I keep hearing the voice of uncle Myer""
I said, ""Mr Graham Cracker,"" (that was my little joke)
""With that wire you got the world in your palm
Just get a mouthpiece, and an earpiece, and a piece in between,
And you'll sponsor The Telephone Hour""

And that was good advice, good advice
Good advice costs nothing, and it's worth the price
Every word you hear
Is the message of the year,
It's good advice

Christopher Columbus was a seaman second class
When I told him that the Indies could be found
By sailing to the west instead of sailing to the east
I advised him that I thought the world was round
(I really thought so)
And then I sent him down to ask good Queen Isabella
To pawn her jewels for all their worth
Next day he set sail, and as everyone knows,
He fell off the edge of the earth

And that was bad advice, bad advice
Bad advice is just the same as good advice
Everybody makes
Occasional mistakes,
And that was bad advice",Good Advice
Allan Sherman,"Listen all you children to my sad refrain
About a subway conductor on a runaway train
Squeezing people into cars, he won his fame
And John Charles Cohen was the great man's name

J. C. Cohen, what a great conductor
IRT that's a subway line
And if you gotta travel uptown
He's a greater conductor than Leonard Bernstein

'Twas on a Sunday in the summer and from everywhere
People planned to take a subway to the World's Fair
A half a million people tried to push and jar
All of them determined to get in one car

But the IRT depended on their finest men
J. C. Cohen could pack a subway like a sardine can
He pushed the people up and back and 'round about
He squeezed so many in he squeezed the engineer out

J. C. Cohen, what a great conductor
How he'd moan, step to the rear
J. C. Cohen, he really had a problem
On a subway train without an engineer

J. C. tried to get into the engineer's place
But when he look inside the cab, he saw a strange man's face
A half pint drunk with a full pint bottle
He emptied out the bottle and he yelled, full throttle

They passed Columbus Circle doing 82
A couple minutes later they were under Bronx Zoo
J. C. shuddered and he said, ""I guess
This used to be a local but it's now an Express""

J. C. Cohen, what a great conductor
Kept his head when everyone was tense
He said, ""When we pass the city limits
Everybody pays another fifteen cents""

J. C. said, ""We're heading north, my friends
But not a man alive knows where the subway ends""
The train went under Albany at 90 flat
And Governor Rockefeller hollered, ""What was that?""

A lady said to J. C. Cohen with indignation
""If this is Albany then you have passed my station
So either you should take me back to fifty ninth Street
Or ask one of these gentlemen to give me his seat""

J. C. Cohen, what a great conductor
J. C. Cohen noticed something odd
When he saw lobsters on the roadbed
He said, ""I got a feeling we're beneath Cape Cod""

Oh well, the train kept speeding to the north my friends
Finally came to where the tunnel ends
When they came up to the surface from the long, long hole
They were twenty seven inches from the great North Pole

J. C. hollered, ""Everybody out
This is the end of the line beyond the shadow of a doubt""
They went out to get some fresh air and before they took a whiff
Cohen and all the passengers were frozen stiff

J. C. Cohen, what a great conductor
Bless his soul, he ran out of luck
J. C. Cohen, he was really frozen
And he had to be brought home in a Good Humor truck

When they told Mrs. Cohen that she'd lost her man
She said, ""Must you interrupt me when I'm playing Pan?""
Then she said to her partner, Mrs. R. J. Rosen
""Cohen was a lovely husband but he's no good frozen""

Then she went to her little boy and took his hand
And she said, ""I'm going to take you out to Disneyland
So Melvin, little darling, don't you weep or wail
'Cause you got another papa on the monorail""
Got another papa on the monorail

Because one hippopotami is two hippopotamus

He was worse than Louis the Fifteenth
He was worse than Louis the Fourteenth
He was worse than Louis the Thirteenth

King Louis was living like a king, but the people were living rotten
So the people, they started an uprising which they called the French Revolution, 
And of course you remember their battle cry, which will never be forgotten

You went the wrong way, Old King Louie

We wouldn't do a thing,

And now you ain't got far to go
Too bad you won't be here to see

Or Brigitte Bardot

To you King Louie we say fooey
You disappointed all of France
But then what else could we expect
From a king in silk stockings
And pink satin pants

You filled your stomach with chop suey
And also crepe suzettes and steak
And when they told your wife Marie
That nobody had bread, she said
""Let 'em eat cake""

Down to the guillotine,

And when that fella's through
With what he's gonna do,
You'll have no place to hang your crown

You don't need the army 'cause you've seen Bob Hope.

That you studied under Cassius Clay.
Then put some lipstick on when you're photographed,
And that's what they call dodging the draft!

Then you show the captain a note from mom,
Stand there while he reads it and suck your thumb.
When he takes your family history, state with pride,
""Benedict Arnold was on my father's side.""

He'll hand you an IQ test, just look at it with gloom,

The hero of the song was originally Jewish, and I made him Chinese - which is no small achievement, actually. Uh, and the reason I did that was that a couple months ago, in January, I was appearing in San Francisco, and it happened to be during the Chinese New Year. And I learned that to the Chinese people, this is the year 4664. And of course to the Jewish people, this is the year 5726. Which means that for 1062 years, Jewish people have had to do their own laundry.

Now this is a very tender, poignant song, actually. It's beautiful if you want to know. I figure I better tell you it's beautiful before I start singing it, because once I start you'll have no way of knowing that it's beautiful.

To the tune of ""Begin the Beguine""
In this most unusual, most unusual, most unusual play

Oh, the language is a bit loose
It's decidedly not Mother Goose
Outside on the marquee
This quotation you'll see
""I was shocked!"" and it's signed Lenny Bruce

It's a play where something went wrong
'Cause it's five hours, twelve minutes long
If you sit there, my friend,
From beginning to end
Then your bladder better be strong

There are people hitting people
There's a couple in a cage
There's neurotics, there's narcotics,
And the bathroom is right on the stage!

It's a great big critical smash,
And it's raking in all kinds of cash
But the theater's appalling
With things that are crawling
I think I am getting a rash

Allan Sherman,"This one I wrote this afternoon.
That's the truth.
I had written the first little part of this, and I sang it two weeks ago Sunday on the Ed Sullivan show, and...the song is called ""Mononucleosis""...and my daughter, I talked to her, and she said all the kids in her school, there were a hundred kids in her junior high school who had it, and they think it's a real good subject for a song. And, that's why I originally wrote it was that she had come home with this mononucleosis about six months ago (she's thirteen), and then Life magazine came out a month or so later with an article on it that explained that it was the kissing disease. So I put those two facts together. I'm a very, you know, thrilling detective. And I was wondering, well, you know, I'm...I guess I'm old-fashioned because about six months ago she got one of those learner's brassieres...Well actually she's learning real good if you want to know! I mean, the first couple of weeks it used to slide down and dangle around her ankles and trip her, but she's really getting the hang of it now.
Anyway, so, I dedicated this song sort of to her because of the curiosity that was aroused in my mind by these two things happening at once. And it goes like this...
We don't have any arrangement of it, they're just kinda faking it, and we'll just try it. If it works, we'll stick it on the album, if not, I'll just...kill myself.
Go ahead.",The Learner's Brassiere
Allan Sherman,"Counting both feet, I have ten toes,
They're not lady toes, they're men toes
And I keep them as mementoes,
For I love them tenderly

All my hands are full of fingers,
Very good as doorbell ringers
And the thought of fingers lingers
In my haunted memory

In the middle is my carcass,
And I always dress my carcass
In the best from Neiman-Marcus
That's a big store in Big D

Which I'll show you if you doubt me

And the Spaniards, they dance on a table
And the Russians, they dance on a saber

Which they squeeze from one cow or anutta
Yes, the Mexicans dance on their hats

There are Mexicans dancing on derbies
There are Mexicans dancing on caps
They just throw their fedoras
Wherever the floor is,
And start doing horas and taps

They won't quit! They go on!
It's a Mexican custom,
To take hats and bust 'em,
By doing a dance thereupon

Was he danced on his mother's mantilla
And the message did not reach Garcia
He was out somewhere dancing on hats

There's a fellow in West Acapulco,
The most elegant man you could meet
He does sambas on hombergs
To tunes of Sig Romberg's,
And sometimes the Nutcracker Suite

And ruin your Stetson,
'Cause they all think they're Fred Astaire!

If you're ever in Mexico proper,
And you're wearing a straw hat or topper,
When the band starts to play, call a copper,

And that's that!

Allan Sherman,"This song here is by far the sexiest of all the songs that I've done tonight. I am telling you that as a warning. All those who have a low threshold of sex, you had better leave now, because I will not be responsible for all the screaming and grabbing that goes on once I start to sing this. Some fellas have it and some fellas don't. I just happen to have it. And I'm gonna give it to you.

Now, I wrote this song for married people. Married people will understand this best. Uh, I realize that tonight there are a lot of people in the audience who are not married, but I figure the line of demarcation has gotten so fuzzy lately that you'll understand it too. Let's hear it for fuzzy demarcation, folks! I said that line in Vegas, and there's a pit boss named Fuzzy Demarcation came running out...

This song is sung by a husband to his wife. They've been married ten or fifteen years, and this song illustrates what can happen in a modern marriage. And I have to pick somebody out to be my wife for this, so I'll pick you. Is that all right? OK.",Warning to Those Who Have a Low Threshold of Sex

Allan Spencer,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polkadots and Moonbeams

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

Allen Ginsberg,"When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy, 
And the dimpling stream runs laughing by; 
When the air does laugh with our merry wit, 
And the green hill laughs with the noise of it; 

When the meadows laugh with lively green, 
And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene, 
When Mary and Susan and Emily
With their sweet round mouths sing ""Ha, ha he!""

When the painted birds laugh in the shade, 
Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread:
Come live, and be merry, and join with me, 
To sing the sweet chorus of ""Ha, ha, he!""",Laughing Song

Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams

One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro

And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues

From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together

So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now",Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas
Alley Cats,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!",Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

Compromettants, compromettants à partir du moment où, personnellement
Je m'intéresse aux ragots d'enfants, mis à part que dans ce cas les enfants
Paraissent bien grands, grands pour ces gens le mot est glorifiant,
Chiant, ils le sont la plupart du temps,
Intelligents ils le seront quand ils cesseront leurs tromperies
A tire larigot, go ha ha go hé hé go ha ha, go zéro :
Tous ces gigolos, zigotos, rigolos en un mot zéro, ne méritent aucune estime
Ils ne méritent que la peine du poteau,

Aux adeptes du Maze, aux adeptes de Puba

Se rendre en soirée en oubliant l'objectif premier
C'est avant tout le respect
Pour les danseurs en effet
Car il faut que la fête reste dans les têtes
Et me voilà dans un état plus que serein
Une fois n'est pas coutume, à moi de corriger le malsain
Tous les matins au chant du tsoin tsoin, hum, le remerciement va de soi
C'est pour qui, c'est pour quoi, c'est pour toi ? C'est pour lui, c'est pour ça ?
Muchas gracias merci et trace !
La langue pendue, la tête dans le cul, et l'esprit de mauvais cru
Où est l'utilité de prêter attention à de tels individus
Vous le savez ou vous l'avez su
Le tout est de tirer profit d'une telle expérience et par chance
De ne plus côtoyer à nouveau le fruit d'une telle semence
C'est la raison pour laquelle nous sommes tellement Funky so Funky

Na, die meisten, also bisschen mehr als die Hälfte vielleicht

Alligatoah,"Guten Tag, was kann ich für Sie tun?
Ja, ähm also, ich wollt mich mal hier beschwern, ne also
Ich-ich hab das gelesen, ne? Nö also ich find das unfassbar'

Von sechs Milliarden, bin ich ein Mensch
Ich hab das Recht mitzureden, das ist mein Senf
Was da gerade passiert, da bin ich Standhaft dagegen
Lasst uns protestieren, jeder kann was bewegen
Ist doch Demokratie. Oder etwa nicht? Ist das zu glauben?
Es darf nichts passieren, ohne dass ich das erlaube
Ich habe irgendwo mit halbem Ohr was aufgeschnappt
Das geht mir auf'n Sack! Jetzt wird Radau gemacht
Ich lese große Sätze in der Regenbogen Presse
Nicht die kleinen
Meistens reichen schon die Bilder für ne regungslose Fresse
Das ist unverschämt! Wir müssen da was unternehmen
So eine Gemeinheit! Ich kann da nicht den Grund verstehen
Ich kann das beurteilen, ich bin ein normaler Mensch
Wer anders denkt, ist wohl total beschränkt
Jojo
Natürlich bin ich auch für Meinungsfreiheit
Meine Meinung ist so frei, da gibt deine klein bei

Wir sind dagegen! Das geht nicht!
Da gehen wir gegen an! Zur Not ein Leben lang
Wir sind dagegen! Das geht nicht!
Da gehen wir gegen an! Zur Not ein Leben lang

Wogegen sind Sie denn?

Ich bin gegen Dinge, die ich eklig finde
Den normalen Pi-Pa-Po gegen Krieg und so
Ich bin gegen das System, denn es ist Tot und Gewalt
Ich bin gegen Gewalt! (Ne, is ja klar) Zur Not mit Gewalt!
Jetzt dürfen Sie für die Verbrechen büßen. Guck, wie sie verrecken müssen
Die Statistik sagt, dass 80% aller Heckenschützen
Bevor Sie Hecken schießen, Speck genießen
Daraus lässt sich schließen, wir müssen Speck verbieten
Tierfell bringen sie auf der ganzen Welt an den Mann
Zur Demo zieh' ich meinen neusten Pelzmantel an
Ich bin nämlich so gegen Tierquälerei, da muss ich mein Mundwerk zügeln
Das macht mich so wütend, dass ich jedes Mal mein Hund verprügel
Ich bin gegen CO2, man wir sind am Ende
Kann denn hier nicht einer einmal an die Kinder denken?
Und der Himmel wird schwarz sowie Condoleezza Rice
Komm wir machen eine Demo, dass die Sonne wieder scheint

Wir sind dagegen! Das geht nicht!
Da gehen wir gegen an! Zur Not ein Leben lang

Wir sind dagegen! Das geht nicht!
Da gehen wir gegen an! Zur Not ein Leben lang

Wie würden Sie's denn machen?
Na alles besser natürlich! Passen Sie auf

Ich bin gegen Diplom, wer braucht so einen Scheiss?
Diese lebenden Toten, haben uns ewig betrogen
Das ist Revolution, ich betrete den Thron
Ich mach es besser denn von mir werden die Fäden gezogen
Dann lege ich los, die Arbeit ist hart
Denn das System hatte Jahre lang ein Penis im Po
Ich nehme jede Menge Geld und dann gebe ich's dem Volk, yoah
Da gehört es hin so wie ein Zebra in Zoo
Was? Berater? Was redest du bloß? Unsere Schulden belaufen sich auf mehrere Millionen
Ich seh mich gezwungen, das Problem ist zu groß. Alle Arbeiter bekommen weniger Lohn
Doch des ist zu wenig für meinen Mercedes in Chrom
Also müssen wir Ressourcen wieder aus dem guten alten Regenwald holen
Ja ich weiß am Anfang war auch ich gegen Korruption
Aber auch ich brauche mein tägliches Brot
Für die 100.000 Menschen hat sich's eh nicht gelohnt
Und am Ende führen eh alle Wege nach Rom
Was soll ich machen? Man hier oben kannst du nicht jedem geben es sind Prioritäten und so
Und jetzt haben wir den Salat, die Rebellen der nächsten Generation beschweren sich schon
Wie stellt Ihr euch das vor? Ich schicke ma' eben ne Armee zum Ozon
Ihr wollt Frieden. Aber Krieg aber wie soll ich Soldaten schicken mit leeren Patronen?
Wäret ihr hier oben, wüsstet ihr, man kann sich nicht kümmern um die Meinung von jedem Idioten
Ich bin einer von euch doch mir wird mit Schlägen gedroht, fickt eure Revolution

Es gibt Dinge, die wünsch ich meinem ärgsten Feind nicht

Mit den teuersten Steaks und dem besten Wein
Glänzender Schmuck ist am Start, ich hab Gold

Und kämpfen, wenn ich sie auf Knopfdruck losschick
Ohne Rücksicht auf Verluste, weil der Ort nach dem Tod ist
Der Drahtzieher, meine Krieger kommen aus der ärmsten Siedlung

Alligatoah,"Ruhe im Gerichtssaal! Wir entscheiden heute über das Schicksal
Eines junges Mannes der angeblich Terrorist war
Nun, was die Schandtat betrifft
Herr Staatsanwalt, verlesen Sie die Anklageschrift

(Ja, freilich)

Hohes Gericht, dem Angeklagten
Wird vorgeworfen, Verbrechen begangen zu haben
Unter and'rem sah man ihn C4 an Gleise legen
Sowie Geißeln nehmen oder Feinde knebeln
Zuletzt konnte man ihn in 'nem Bus erkennen
Mit einem Sprenggürtel, um ihn in die Luft zu sprengen
Er ist Terrorist und 'ne Gefahr für die Öffentlichkeit
Ich hab hier eine Aufzeichnung die den Scheiß beweist

Hehe, ein Wunder, dass ich noch nicht vor Lachen den Tod fand
Das kann ja jeder sein, da auf dem Tonband
Verdammt, schau'n Sie ihn sich doch an, meinen Mand-
Dant, er ist unschuldig wie ein Lamm
Ich glaub', Sie brauchen Nachhilfe in Kompetenz
Ihre Vorgehensweise spricht von Inkompetenz
Sie werfen ihm Verbrechen vor, doch er leugnet sie, Game Over
Um glaubwürdig zu sein brauchen Sie Zeugen wie Jehova

Ihre Wortwahl sollten Sie gleich zügeln
Ich möchte fortfahren mit der Beweisführung
Natürlich hab ich Zeugen, Tobi-Tait ist hier
Er hat die Aussage bereits gemacht im Polizeirevier

(Ich schwöre die Wahrheit zu sagen hick, nichts als die Wahrheit, so wahr mir Gott helfe)

(Was ham Sie gesehen?)

Ich lag so wie jede Nacht am Bahnhof und genoss
Den klaren Sternenhimmel und ne gute Flasche Scotch
Und da sah ich auf den Schienen diesen Mann herum spazieren
Er war Minen am platzieren um ein Attentat zu schieben
Ich natürlich gleich zu den Bullen gerannt, auch wenn Kaliba flieht
Ich sach er ist der reinste Drecksschwein, wo's überhaupt hier gibt
Er gehört in den Knast, dieser arschgefickte Spast
Er beruft sich auf Gott und tut was ihm passt

Tze, das ist ja lächerlich, aber ungewollt
Euer Ehren, Sie glauben doch nicht etwa einem Trunkenbold?
Allzu viele Drogen bringen Halluzinationen
Mein Zeuge wird beweisen der hat alle hier belogen

[Verse 7 - Staatsanwalt]
Soo, Sie kennen wohl den echten Täter
Dann lassen Sie mal hören, Herr Rechtsverdreher
Schieb Vergess! Bei mir bewirkt die Täuschung wenig
Sie hab'n Zeugen? Sie sein ja nicht mal zeugungsfähig!

(Lüge!)

(Ääh, Selbstjustizz, schwören Sie die Wahrheit zu sagen, die Wahrheit und nichts als die Wahrheit, so wahr ihnen Gott helfe?)

Ihr seid doch alle bi, ihr sagt, Kalli wär ein Gee
Oder wie? Ach nie, ich gebe ihm ein Alibi
Denn zur Tatzeit hingen wir bei mir in meinem Block
Haben Counter-Strike gezockt und Gerichtsshows geglotzt
Außerdem kenn' ich Kaliba schon 'ne ewig lange Zeit, guck…
(Sie halten auch die Anklage für Bullshit?)
(Einspruch!)
(Stattgegeben.)
Sie meinen Attentätern sieht man's an der Nase an?
Ja, der Mann ist zahm wie ein Lamm!
Ooh, das is ja auch sein Homie! Sie checken's echt nicht
Natürlich versucht er ihn zu decken wie nen Esstisch
Nur die Ruhe, ihr Puls ist ja schon maximal
Ich hab hier noch entlastendes Tonmaterial, Obacht!

Blablabla, fick dich du Spast!
Ja mei, sind Sie jetzt völlig wahns'nnig?
Garnicht, Sie blödes Arschloch
Der Mann gehört hinter Gitter!
Nur weil er schwarz ist ?
Oooh, der trägt doch eine Maske, Sie Idiot!
Achsoo, jetzt leugnen Sie noch ihre Rassenidiologie !
Das Gericht fällt ein Urteil, ungeachtet der Hautfarbe
Es steht Aussage gegen Aussage
Der Mann scheint harmlos und die Beweise sind gleichzusetzen
Es bleibt mir nichts andres übrig, als ihn freizusprechen

(Der Angeklagte hat das letzte Wort)

(Tz, Harmlos, Harmlos? ICH? Harmlos?)

Haha, ich, ich muss zu Vorsicht raten, Sie wissen nicht wen Sie hier vor sich haben
Den gefährlichsten Terrorist und nicht den Osterhasen
Ich hab Anschläge verübt, jepp, Städte verwüstet
Meine Feinde haben mit dem Leben gebüßt, jetzt
Passen Sie mal auf, ich hab einiges auf dem Kerbholz
Und darauf bin ich auch sehr stolz, ich heul nicht rum wie'n Werwolf
Wär toll wenn Sie mir deshalb ne angemessene Strafe verpassen
Das ist in Gottes Namen! Ich würd' alles noch mal so machen!

Alligatoah,"Die letzten 15 Jahre habe ich vor der Gedenktafel meiner Eltern gekniet und gebetet
Ich habe gehofft und darum gebetet, 
Dass mir ihr Geist hilft ihre Mörder ausfindig zu machen um für sie Rache zu nehmen

Ich war sechs, gerade mal ein Kind
Und rate mal was sind
Da die wichtigsten Menschen in deinem Leben
Ja es stimmt die Eltern sind vertraut
Doch welcher Spinner raubt
Dir diese Menschen? Nur ein Monster!
Ich ging heim, der Unterricht war Schluss
Da verwundert mich ein Schuss
Ich rannte, sah den Mann im schwarzen Mantel
Und als ich den Raum betrat, brach die Welt zusammen
Leblose Körper, die mal meine Eltern waren
Liebe starb, Hass wurde geboren, mein Lachen ist gefroren
Ich sinne nun auf Rache, yoar, Massenmord
Deshalb trainiere ich pausenlos
Ein riesen Aufgebot Soldaten schlag ich einfach mausetot
Ich brauche bloß ihn aufspüren
Und dann die Haustür
Mit ganzer Kraft einzurammen, Hab dich!
Er hält dem Mörder seiner Eltern die Waffe ins Gesicht
Der alte Mann dreht sich um, sieht ihn gelassen an und spricht...

Ich bin alt geworden, ich hab nachgedacht
Ich hab Fehler gemacht in jener Nacht
Von Rache besessen brachte ich Waffen zum Sprechen
Während ich heute weiß, es ist ein Teufelskreis
Ich hab mich geändert, hab Familie und Kinder
Doch es sticht jeden Tag, dass ich damals so blind war
Jeder glaubt zu wissen, was Gerechtigkeit ist
Also drück ab, doch dann bist du nicht besser als ich

Meine Vergeltung ist verübt
Und wer bist du jetzt, 
Ich bin der sohn, von mein vatter
Was hast du mit ihm gemacht du schwein
Tsst, ich habe ihn erschossen weil er war böse
Dich werde ich verschonen, Auf wiedersehen
Vater, ich werde dich rächen!

Es war ein Massaker und obwohl ich kein Angsthase bin
Hat ich nur ein Ziel, und zwar Land zu gewinnen
Rannte und landete im
Haus eines Greises, der Kungfu-Meister war
Er war weise, denn er trug weißes Haar
Und zudem wuchs ihm ein Bart
Er nahm mich auf und weil ich Rache verschwieg
Lernte ich den geheimen Drachenkampfstil
Und mit Waffen hantieren
Nach all den Jahren bin ich Karatebomber
Todesfäuste mit 'ner Gnade von 'ner Anakonda
Nach den 36 Kammern und dem hölzernen Mann
Zieh ich bewaffnet wie ein Söldner durchs Land
Und jeder Tölpel ist dran
Der ihn supportet bei seinem blutigen Spiel
Und mit dem Schwert mach ich die Suche nach ihm
Der meine eine Kugel verdient
Es ist so weit, ich hab den elenden Mörder
Nach seinen letzten Worten werd' ich ihn ins Jenseits befördern
Er hält dem Mörder seiner Eltern die Waffe ins Gesicht
Der alte Mann dreht sich um, sieht ihn gelassen an und spricht...

Ich bin alt geworden, ich hab nachgedacht
Ich hab Fehler gemacht in jener Nacht
Von Rache besessen brachte ich Waffen zum Sprechen
Während ich heute weiß, es ist ein Teufelskreis
Ich hab mich geändert, hab Familie und Kinder
Doch es sticht jeden Tag, dass ich damals so blind war
Jeder glaubt zu wissen, was Gerechtigkeit ist
Also drück ab, doch dann bist du nicht besser als ich

Vater! Nein! Ich schwöre, ich werde deinen Tod rächen!

Ich erinnere mich, damals, im Kindergarten, wer mein Lego stiehlt
Zu dem bin ich hin gerannt und hab ihm seine Spielsachen demoliert
Ausgleichende Gerechtigkeit, wenn du mich ficken willst fällst du tief
An demjenigen der meine Eltern getötet hat übe ich Selbstjustiz
Jage den Penner von Norden nach Süden und bis hin nach Griechenland
In meinem Keller brennt jede Nacht Licht, denn ich übe am Schieß – äh – stand
Habe gehört, dass der Mörder auch seiner Seits selber nur Rache verübte
Sie sagen, er wäre genau so wie ich, aber das ist ne Lüge, haltet die Fresse, aah!
Treffe die Frau meines Lebens, auf dieser, ich sage mal, Todesjagd!
Sie rät mir Gewalt zu beenden, die es schon seit Generationen gab
Es wäre ein teuflischer Kreis aus dem man sich nur befreit
Wenn man verzeiht, tut mir Leid!
Ich bin zum Hassen gebor'n, hab die Fasung verlor'n
Als ich an seiner Tür klingel verberge ich, dass ich am Zweifeln bin
Doch statt dem Mann den ich Jahre lang jagte öffnet mir ein kleines Kind
Ich seh' mich in ihm renne dann aber weiter ins Haus seines Vaters
Und halt ihm die Gun ins Gesicht
Der alte Mann dreht sich um und spricht (und spricht)

Hallo, hallo, wir sind die Boten unsres Herrn
Und wir bringen dir die frohe Kunde gern

Dir Liebe schenkt wie ein Familienmensch

Du lebst in Sünde, das war dir nicht klar
Darum sag ichs dir ja, du lebst wie ein Wahnsinniger
Und bald geht gar nichts mehr klar, natürlich
Du kannst dir nicht selbst helfen, wir regeln das für dich

Das verschlägt dir wohl die Sprache um der Wahrheit willen
Empfindest du dein Leben auch als tristen Schwarz-Weiss-Film?
Immer nur faul rumliegen wie ein Pflegeleichtes Kind
Wenn du mit Gott gehst, gibt er deinem Leben einen Sinn, joo

Du bist ein verlorenes Schaaf, ein verlogener Arsch
Du brauchst Hilfe das ist sowas von klar
Du kennst Homer und Marge, doch nicht die heilige Schrift
Das zeigt Gott nur wie Scheiße du bist!

Und wie oft wurdest du zum Sünder durch dein niederen Trieb
Zeige Reue und sieh wie der Leader wieder vergibt
Hast du nicht gestern Hals über Kopf ne Wurst geklaut
Komm wir reißen deinem inneren Purzelbaum die Wurzeln aus

Dich interessieren doch nur die Bitches, Bootylicious
Aber bald schon ist dein Leben von dem du gefickt wirst
Der Teufel packt dich mit seiner Hand an deinen Schuhen
Und du kannst nichts dagegen tun, außer per Bankeinzug

Tja also wenn du nicht willst, wir können dir nur die Tür zeigen
Und dich durchschubsen, denn es ist für dein
Platz im Himmel, das ist der Hammer deal hoch drei

Alligatoah,"Guten Tag, ich hätte gern ein' Strauß Rosen
Ich muss Kaution bezahlen für mein Frauenproblem
Mit leeren Händen geh' ich sicher nicht nach Haus
Denn ich hab mir ein kleines Missgeschick erlaubt
Hallo Schatz, ich hab ein' Pavian gefickt, heut Nacht
Keine Angst, Ich hab dabei an dich gedacht
Du musst wissen, dass das ein Ausrutscher war
Manchmal rutsch ich mit dem Schwanz in eine Frau, Upsala!
Verzeih, dass an deinem großen Freudentage
An meinem Platz nur eine Vogelscheuche saß
Ich war einkaufen und hab jetzt einen privaten Jet
Du hast mich doch gefragt, wo deine Kreditkarte steckt
Jetzt weißt du's, hey, hey! Guck mich an

Ich habe deinen Schäferhund gegessen und verdaut
Ich war zu deiner kleinen Schwester netter als erlaubt
Ich hab dich wieder mal mit der Toilettenfrau vertauscht
Ich glaub, ich schlafe heute Nacht wohl besser auf der Couch
Doch wenn du morgen wieder Diamanten kriegst
Und dem Glanz erliegst, dann hast du Amnesie!
Und wenn du morgen wieder Diamanten kriegst
Und dem Glanz erliegst, dann hast du Amnesie!

Guten Tag, ich hätte gern ein' Eimer Rosen
Es ist so, als müsst ich zu 'ner Beicht-Pastorin
Also wieder mit Geschenk bewaffnet
Bevor ich der gekränkten Gattin das Geständnis mache
Hallo Schatz, ich bin mit Nazis down!
Spaß, aber ich hab HIV
Ich habe auch wieder angefangen, Geiseln zu schlachten (Terrorstyle)
Ich kann es einfach nicht lassen
Tut mir leid, dass ich auf Tabletten, Rotwein
Dir Sachen ins Ohr schrei, wie das mit dem Trostpreis, Macht
Der Gewohnheit, ja, mir ist da wieder ein Malheur passiert,
Das deinen Körper ziert, ich bin ein Störenfried
Schönes Lied zu bösem Spiel, Kennst mich doch

Ich habe deinen Schäferhund gegessen und verdaut
Ich war zu deiner kleinen Schwester netter als erlaubt
Ich hab dich wieder mal mit der Toilettenfrau vertauscht
Ich glaub, ich schlafe heute Nacht wohl besser auf der Couch
Doch wenn du morgen wieder Diamanten kriegst
Und dem Glanz erliegst, dann hast du Amnesie!
Und wenn du morgen wieder Diamanten kriegst
Und dem Glanz erliegst, dann hast du Amnesie!

Kleider, Juwelen, Diademe, sieh mir in die Augen, Bitch
Kleider, Juwelen, es ist niemals geschehen

Alligatoah,"Ach, Schatz, wenn ich mit dir hier so sitz,
Dann vergess ich all meinen Kummer.
Ich wollte dir das gestern schon auf der Party sagen
Aber da war's so laut.
Du bist das beste, was mir passieren konnte, und
Und die Zeit mit dir ist ein riesiges Geschenk.
Ich genieße jeden Augeblick, und das jetzt seit anderthalb Jahren.

Was? Schon seit anderthalb Jahren?!
Dann ist jetzt auch langsam mal gut, ne?
Man soll ja aufhör'n, wenn's am schönsten ist.
Ich sag mal so

Sesshaft werden liegt mir nicht, aber es liegt nicht an dir
Dafür auf der Hand, die Frage ist nur, wie ich's formulier
Solche Sachen sagt man am besten durch ein ganzes Blumenbeet
Damit auch du's verstehst
Du kennst doch Nougat-Creme und Kandis-Würfel
Lecker, aber hat man dann zu viel genascht
Muss man schon beim Anblick würgen
Der Poet weiß, du warst eine klasse Frau
Aber nachts sind alle Katzen grau
Viele Sachen sind nur Phasen so wie das mit Che Guevara
Irgendwann ist man ja auch zu alt für Kasperletheater
Naja, verlassen ist ein hartes Wort wie Pimmelgesicht
Ich verlasse nur ein sinkendes Schiff
Die Geschäftsreise bis hier war perfekt, Kleine
Doch hat man alle GTA-Missionen durch
Kann man die DVD auch wegschmeißen
Man kennt das auch aus der Schauspielbranche zu
Langer Vertrag, keine Aufstiegschancen jetzt is

Erntedank, ich bin schwer betankt
Das Feld trägt keine Frucht mehr, die mich nähren kann
Erntedank, ich hab nicht mehr verlangt
Der Hunger treibt mich in ein fernes Land
Denn wir sind Nomaden, Nomaden
Die müssen weiter ziehen
Wir sind Nomaden, Nomaden
Nur keine Zeit verlieren
Wir sind Nomaden, Nomaden
Die müssen weiter ziehen
Wir sind Nomaden, Nomaden, Nomaden, Nomaden, Nomaden
Die bleiben nie am gleichen Ziel

Baby, ich weiß von deiner krassen Angst
Ich hab gesagt, dass ich für immer bleibe,
Worauf du dich verlassen kannst
Doch verlassen ist auch schon das Stichwort
Alles hat ein Ende, du kennst doch das Sprichwort
Siehst du die Rose hier? Die ist bald abgeblüht
Du warst mein schönster Fall, bevor sich die Akte schließt
Von meinem Aktmodell zum Auslaufmodell
Ich muss leider weg zum Wagen, der grad draußen hält
Mit deiner Nachfolgerin, für kurze Zeit mein Traum
Man kann den gleichen Kaugummi doch nicht zweimal kau'n
Deine Achterbahn ist abgefahren, ich muss zum Riesenrad
Es gibt so viel bunte Fahrgeschäfte in dieser Stadt
Das Leben ist ein Autoscooter, man bumst so rum
Und eckt halt an, dann steigt man aus
Stichwort Billy Boy, stell dir doch einfach vor
Das Büro hier wär' oval und läg' im Weißen Haus

Erntedank, ich bin schwer betankt
Das Feld trägt keine Frucht mehr, die mich nähren kann
Erntedank, ich hab nicht mehr verlangt
Der Hunger treibt mich in ein fernes Land
Denn wir sind Nomaden, Nomaden
Die müssen weiter ziehen

Nur keine Zeit verlieren
Wir sind Nomaden, Nomaden

Äh, okay, der ist tatsächlich schwul
Deinen Bettbezug bring' ich dir morgen rum
Ich warte immer noch auf den Laborbefund
Die sagen, du hast kein Gilette-Wachs benutzt

Immer dieser Typ vor dir, der Zeitung liest mit Gucklöchern
Manchmal werden meine Rohstoffe knapp
Mehr Hoden im Club als ich KO-Tropfen hab

Überwach so krass, von mir kann selbst der Staat noch was lernen

Jetzt wird es krass spannend, jetzt werde ich achtsam

Schlappschwanz, geh sofort zurück und leg die Fotze flach
Spione, Helikopter, was denkt ihr, was das gekostet hat?!
Es kann nicht sein, dass ich mein' Jahreslohn verschwende
Damit du am Ende dastehst wie ein makelloser Engel
Nimm den Schwanz, Frau, dann kann ich die Standpauke halten
Du musst schuld sein, sonst will ich zu Sandstaub zerfallen
Mach den einen falschen Step und ich bleibe im Recht
Bau das Drama, das mich in die Freiheit entlässt

Seid mal leise, ich glaub, der will was erzählen! Schhh!

Lasst mich euch berichten von einem jungen Mann
Seiner goldnen Ära und seinem Untergang
Alle seine Freunde sahen ihn als Genie
Er konnte ein Klavier auf seiner Nase balancieren
Schneller als sein Schatten über seinen Schatten springen
Ja, selbst Beamte ohne Keller konnte er zum Lachen bringen
So unterhaltsam, dass man ihn mit Lobgesang empfängt
Präsent auf jedem Fest, ein Virtuose am Getränk
Bei allen Frauen beliebt und eine balzte mit Begier
Ihr Angebot verfällt nicht, nur verfallen ist er ihr
Alle seine Freunde warnten ahnungsvoll
Doch Jugendleichtsinn folgt dem Ball,
Der auf die Straße rollt
Sein Herr wohnt nun in seiner Brust
Und lockt mit Frauenfleisch
Lässt ihn absurde Dinge tun, ja,
Denn sonst wird er ausgepeitscht
Alle seine Freunde ham' Distanz gewählt
Denn sein Herz hat ihm befohlen
Dass die Stadt in Flammen steht

Und dieser Mann ist heute Abend hier!","Hört, Hört (Intro)"

Du musst auf jeden Fall die Gitarre spielen, um die ins Bett zu kriegen

Das trifft sich gut, denn eigentlich
Bin ich Gitarrist, einer der besten
Du bist bereit für die Session? Ich muss erst leise antesten
Schau, ich hatte mal 'ne Band mit Ringo Starr und John Lennon
Doch beim Namen gab's keinen Konsens, also prompt Trennung
Jetzt bin ich solo, doch mein Instrument bringt Heiterkeit
Ein Mönch hat es einst gefeilt aus seinem eig'nen Bein
Darauf kann ich alles, ich brauch bloß noch 'n Vorschlag (Beethoven?)
Ah, du möchtest Smoke on the Water
Die Klampfe klingt jetzt nur nicht gut wegen der kochenden Hitze
Außerdem ist das Ding kaputt, da ist 'n Loch in der Mitte
Jetzt glaubt mir trotzdem bitte, ich bin Gitarrist, ich lasse
Mir doch nicht aus Spaß die Haare bis zur Lippe wachsen, puk!

Ich war mit 'ner Armee Terroristen
In einer Gegend mit vernebeltem Sichtfeld
Wir brauchten Pläne und Skizzen
Da hab ich auf die Zähne gebissen
Bin auf der Wasserstoffrakete geritten
Ich überlebte, denn ich aß davor mehrere Schnitzel
Das war wie'n federndes Kissen, jetzt kann ich's jedem berichten

Ihr Jacke wie Hose denn sie kriegt Kohle, schlimm,
Ich frag mich wer für so 'ne Schlampe bezahlt
„Die gibt dir nicht mal einen Kuss, hat ein Bekannter gesagt“ Äh

Es gibt Menschen, die es nie begreifen
Wir bewerfen sie mit Ziegelsteinen
Dafür muss man nicht mal auf die Straße gehen
Ach wie gut, dass wir im Glashaus leben

Ich habe gehört ihre Ehefrau
Hat ihnen jetzt auch einen Stammeshalter geschenkt?
Sehr richtig, ich bin auch unter die Väter gegangen.
Ja, ist er denn auch so ein hochbegabter Knabe wie meiner?
Joa, ich will die Pferde nicht scheu machen, aber

Mein Sohn wird mal mehr als nur einen Baum säen
Er wird der beste Athlet auf Erden so wie in Raumfähren
Er wird ein Star auch wenn ihm Worte zum Gebrauch fehlen
Mein Sohn kennt Aufgaben, aber nicht Aufgeben

Dein Sohn nennt meinen Sohn später eure Eminenz
Sollte er nicht Papst werden, dann wird er deutscher Präsident
Für den kleinen Racker früh schaffbar
Dann fließt wieder Honig in den Flüssen dieses Landes,
Anstatt Süßwasser

Mein Sohn wird deinen Lümmel besiegen
Mein Sohn macht Gold bei den Olympischen Spielen,
Bestimmt in fünf Disziplinen
Weil er mehr Pokale hält, als seine Sportlergesellen
Es sind so viele, ich musst sie leider in den Vorgarten stellen

Dein Sohn wird bestimmt nur ein Spastiker wie doof
Aber meiner schafft Abhilfe, denn er wird Plastischer Chirurg
Verkleinert von jedem Fettarsch den Umfang
Wird gleich nach dem Medizinstudium Chefarzt mit Kusshand

Mein Sohn wird schon im zarten Alter Basketballer
Er nennt mich sicher nur spaßeshalber manchmal Sklavenhalter
Mein Sohn hat kein gemütliches Pensum
Doch er wird nicht mehr vom Üben abgelenkt
Seit meiner Bücherverbrennung

Mein Sohn wird mal ein umjubelter Musiker sein
Bringt alle Groupies zum schreien, gewinnt den Pulitzer-Preis
Lädt Videos hoch, als Philosoph wie Sokrates, nur Leckerlis
Wird rigoros zum Gigolo, schreibt monatlich zehn Evergreens

Komm zu Daddy, wenn ich rufe

Weil ich mich nicht klonen kann
Hab ich einen Sohnemann
Er rennt, denn schwarze Federn sind ihm wohlbekannt

Ja aber des is doch der, ach ne, das ist ja Jahre her!
Berichte, wie geht es deinem Sohn? Ehm meinem Sohn?, äh

Naja mein Sohn entwickelt sich etwas langsam
Nicht bereit zur Arbeit zu gehen, aber bereit zu jeder Schandtat
Weder ganztags im Landrat, noch Kanzler oder Amtsarzt
Er ist jetzt bei der Bank „Bei welcher?“ Bei der im Stadtpark

Mein Sohn hält den Rekord im Hausverbot bekommen
Mein Sohn kann einfach alles, er beklaute sogar Nonnen
Mein Sohn ist ein Charmeur, ihm sind die Frauen wohlgesonnen
Denn betritt er eine Bühne, hat er faules Obst gewonnen

Niemals hat mein Sohn Probleme
Wenn es um Frauen geht, denn er führt eine Homoehe
Sein Werdegang ist schwer und lang, doch es reicht bis zum Doktor
Mein einziger Sohn ist jetzt meine einzige Tochter

Mein Sohn hat die größte Wohnung im Kellergeschoss
Mein Sohn ist der stärkste seiner Zellengenossen
Er ist schon lange da wohnhaft, er lebt mit Ansgar und Olaf
Die geben ihm Liebe, denn er war neulich Gefang'ner des Monats

Mein Sohn war einst der Stolz meiner Sippschaft
Jetzt macht er für's gemeine Volk leider Hip-Hop
Ist zwar kein Musiker, aber wurde vom Tellerwäscher
Hinter'm Kellerfenster zum Backup-Rapper, trotz Textversprecher

Kommt mein Sohn raus, läuft er Amok nur mit Axt und Motorsäge
Frag mich „Woher hat der Bastard seine Aggressionsprobleme?“ Okay
Der Junge ist nicht fehlerlos, obwohl ich ihn extrem erzog
Hmm, vielleicht klappt's ja beim nächsten Sohn

Komm zu Daddy, wenn ich rufe
Sonst fressen dich die Raben!

Und Ruhe

Und ich gab jedem Trauerfeierlied dieselbe Chance
Keins war genug monumental und herzzereißend,
Von Queen bis Elton John
Diesen Harfensängern überlasse ich doch nicht die Show auf meiner großen Todesfeier
Hier der Song vom Zeremonienmeister
Das Fest beginnt, ich stell es mir gigantisch vor
Ich hoffe doch ihr habt mir einen Elefant besorgt
Ich seh' prasselnden Regen, in der Masse fließen Tränen
Kinderaugen fragen, wann sie Papa wieder sehen
Es gibt noch Fotos, da kann man mich in kraftbepackter Pracht betrachten
Ich hab auch T-Shirts und Kaffeetassen machen lassen
80 Tacken, die Bestattungskasse schluckt
Wer keins mehr kriegt, kann auch wahrscheinlich Bilder meiner straffen Brust
Auf allen privaten und offenen Kanälen, in Blogs und in jeglichem Wochenblatt sehen
Ich geh' mal davon aus, dass das geklappt hat mit meiner Modellkarriere
Trotzdem Danke, für das zahlreiche Erscheinen
Aber ja nicht streiten, etwas Wartezeit und jeder darf sich vor dem Sarg verneigen
Pscht

Ihr schafft den Rest allein
Wem ist heute keine Träne in die Hände geflossen?
Ihr schafft den Rest allein
Der ist ein schlechter Mensch und wird von Engeln erschossen
Ihr schafft den Rest allein
Doch es wird alles wieder gut
Ihr schafft den Rest allein
Denn ihr hört dieses Lied im Loop und meine letzten Worte,
Bevor ich zu den Sternen schweb'
Gern geschehen

Hört ihr den Wind in den Bäumen singen?
Ich werd' euch den Weg weisen
Ich bin hier oben, über euch wie schon zu Lebzeiten
Dir, holde Maid, bin ich ein Schutzengel im Wolkenreich
Wenn du jemand anderen fickst, dann werd' ich eher Poltergeist
Jungs, ich werd' euch auch fehlen, oder?
Denkt daran, dass ich euch stets mein Haustelefon gab
So viel gute Taten, alter, sogar schon der Bäcker im Dorf
Meinte, wenn ich weg bin ist die Welt ein besserer Ort
Ihr schafft den Rest allein
Also die Drecksarbeit
So 'n Mausoleum bleibt nich' von alleine fleckenfrei
Und rächt meinen Mord doch schafft euch Heimvorteil
Wenn er mich besiegt hat, muss er ein Cyborg sein
Hab mittlerweile mir bestimmt 'ne Religion zugelegt
Um so so gut es geht, der Angst vor dem Tod souverän zu entgehn
Hab nie großspurig Hochmut gelebt
Doch Paradiese reißen sich um mich, losbudenmäßig, ey

Ich bin verliebt,
Sieht man doch.

Es ist eine wunderschöne Sommernacht
Ich chill' mit Kontrabass im Monstertruck
Vergrabe Nudeln und ihr fragt mich wozu
Denn ich lache und beginne, aus der Nase zu bluten
Guck mal, seit Tagen red ich lediglich mit Fabelwesen
Ich sammel' Fotos meiner schönsten Grafikfehler
Und ihr sagt, ich wäre seltsam geworden, ja ja ve ve
Ich sitze da und les AGBs
Verrückt, ihr wollt ein beschissenes Spiel?
Glotze aus, ich trinke jedesmal, wenn nix passiert und
Dann rauf auf den Balkon, ich brülle Nazitexte
Sorry, hab mich grade mit dem Papst verwechselt
Damn Girl, weil du hinreißend bist
Tätowier' ich dein Gesicht in mein Gesicht
Mir ist alles scheißegal, ich würde Kinder erschießen
Was blind? Ich bin geistig behindert vor Liebe

Dann stand sie einfach so da
Ist sie der heilige Gral?
Oder nur heiße Gefahr?
Wer weiß?
Ich muss sie treffen sofort
Werd' ich dann lächelnd umsorgt?
Oder mit Messern durchbohrt?
Wer weiß?

Extrablatt, verseuchte Gewässer, will mich entschuldigen
Doch sage, Hurensohn! Freudscher Versprecher
Ich habe neulich im Affekt Medizin studiert
Und dennoch weiß ich nix von ihr außer, ich liebe hmm
Zurück zur Ironie, guck, ich bin Schnäppchenjäger
Und mach mir 'ne Geschlechts-OP klar, YOLO!
Ich werde nie zur Ruhe kommen
Auf Fotos siehst du mich nur verschwommen
Ihr sagt, ich hab mehr Craziness als das gelähmte Kind
Das auf Kekse wichst, hahaha versteh' ich nicht
Irgendwas hat mein' Schädel-Innenraum zerstört
Jetzt hab ich sogar mit dem Trinken aufgehört, was soll ich tun?!
Suizid scheidet aus, denn Marktforscher wissen
Ihr würdet Alligatoah vermissen
Aber mäh' ich wieder Rasen solltet ihr euch in den Zimmern verkriechen
Was blind? Ich bin geistig behindert vor Liebe

Dann stand sie einfach so da
Ist sie der heilige Gral?
Oder nur heiße Gefahr?
Wer weiß?
Ich muss sie treffen sofort
Werd' ich dann lächelnd umsorgt?
Oder mit Messern durchbohrt?
Wer weiß? (Wer weiß, wer weiß, egal)

Ich handel' nicht mehr rational, Robben schlachten!
Ich habe keine andre Wahl, Robben schlachten!
Liebe macht doch krank, ich darf Robben schlachten!
Humor ist, trotzdem lachen

Will jeder wissen, keiner hilft uns, Fair play
Gott sei dank gibt es Film und Fernsehen
Da, wo ich meine Bildung her nehm'
Glaub mir, das wird super, für deine Story hab ich schon den Grund
Weshalb du in deiner Jugendphase wutgeladen bist
Dein Papa kam nicht zu deinem Schultheaterstück
Bei mir finden wir schon was, wo der Schuh gerade drückt
Wir kennen uns seit X Jahren
Du brauchst jetzt nix sagen
Ich wollt dich fragen, wollen wir den nächsten Schritt wagen?

Willst du mit mir Drogen nehmen?
Dann wird es rote Rosen regnen
Ich hab's in einer Soap gesehen
Willst du mit mir Drogen nehmen?

Komm wir gehen zusammen den Bach runter
(Komm) Komm, wir gehen,
Komm wir gehen zusammen den Bach runter
(Komm) Komm, wir gehen
Komm, wir gehen zusammen den Bach runter
(Komm) Denn ein Wrack ist ein Ort, an dem ein Schatz schlummert.

Jetzt sind wir frei, chillen auf gigantischen Berggipfeln
Du musst dann sagen, keiner kann unsern Schmerz diggen
Wir sammeln erstmal fröhliche Kiff-Sonntage
Für die hituntermalte Schnittmontage
Komm schon, das wird romantisch
Wenn ich dich halte, damit du nicht auf den Klorand brichst
Dann verdienen wir ein Kerzen-Paket
Für die erste WG auf 'nem Herren-WC
Eine herbstliche Szene, weil es passt
Und ich falle auf die Knie und hol aus meiner Jacke
Eine kleine Schachtel, du weißt, was abgeht

Willst du mit mir Drogen nehmen?

Und dann brauchen wir epische Fights, wer das lausige H kriegt
Zuschauer, rauchende Babys
Sie werden nicht verwöhnt, die müssen Fertigsuppe löffeln
Und die spielen mit vom Körperbau entfernten Puppenköpfen
Du willst raus per klischeehafter Flucht in ein Landhaus
Ich brüll' dann so was wie „Gleich rutscht mir die Hand aus!
Du wirst mit den Kindern nirgendwohin fahren!“
Ich werd' euch mit 'ner Axt durch ein Labyrinth jagen
Im Winter, weil ich das Bild feier'
Mach unser Leben filmreifer als Til Schweiger
Es hat Action, Drama und Comedy
Also was sagst du, mon chéri?

Dann wird es rote Rosen regnen
Um dem Kinofilm die Show zu stehlen

Ich präsentiere ihnen die schlechtesten Transvestiten der Welt (yeah)
Treten sie ein.

Ey das ist Drag Queen Shneezin, der vor'm Schminkspiegel steht
Ich nehm' Schwarz für die Augen, aber Pink für die Zähne
Baby damn bin ich scharf und ich brauch mich nicht rasieren
Denn ich kämm' jeden Tag meinen glänzenden Bart
Und die Männlichkeit verschwindet durch Extensions im Haar
Ach ja, warte mal
Jetzt hab ich gerade nachgedacht und glaub mir das war hart
Ich hab noch immer keinen Plan
Ob jetzt die Nadel in meinen Haaren passt (Wozu denn?)
Ja zu der Farbe von meinem Nagellack (okay) mein muskulöses Kreuz
In Verbindung mit dem Lipgloss und der Brustbehaarung
Deutet darauf hin dass ich 'ne Schwuchtel bin aber guck doch mal das täuscht
Ich bin ein Mann gewesen, aber innerlich 'ne Frau
Schon von Geburt an spürte ich mit meinem Pimmel ist was faul
Es war einfach das Letzte, doch jetzt zeig ich es dem Rest
Ich muss nur extravagant ein paar Highlights setzen
Und nach ein, zwei Schnäpsen bin ich reif für Action

Ist es der eiserne Arm
Oder der Dreitagebart
Oder mein kleiner Pirat, ich geb 'nen Scheiß, was ihr sagt
Ich sehe ungewöhnlich aus
Doch ich bin eine wunderschöne Frau

Ist es der eiserne Arm
Oder der Dreitagebart
Oder mein kleiner Pirat, ich geb 'nen Scheiß, was ihr sagt
Ich sehe ungewöhnlich aus
Doch ich bin eine wunderschöne Frau

Ey ich streu' ein wenig Säure vermengt mit etwas Badesalz
In meinen Schambereich, gegen die Beharrlichkeit
Stardesigntes Abendkleid, hängt über 'mei'm Arschgeweih
Gestern war ich Timä, doch ab heute heiß ich Adelheid.
Ups in meiner Vagina steckt Alligatoahs Nasenbein.
Ey Shneezin, ah bring mir mal das Blasen bei.
„Ne ich hab grad keine Zeit
Komm frag doch mal Mike“
Mike hatte auch keine Zeit
Ja das enttäuscht mich ein bisschen.
„Was macht er denn?“ Der wird grad von Keule gefistet.
Wie komm ich endlich wieder näher zum G-Punkt?
Vielleicht „mit so einer Art Scherenbewegung“.
Gib mir das Messer mein Junge und ich handle das schon
„Was machst du da?“ Ich arbeite an meiner Menstruation
Und entferne den Cock
Eine wunderschöne Frau sein ist ein schmerzhafter Job

Ist es der eiserne Arm
Oder der Dreitagebart
Oder mein kleiner Pirat, ich geb 'nen Scheiß, was ihr sagt
Ich sehe ungewöhnlich aus
Doch ich bin eine wunderschöne Frau

Ist es der eiserne Arm
Oder der Dreitagebart
Oder mein kleiner Pirat, ich geb 'nen Scheiß, was ihr sagt
Ich sehe ungewöhnlich aus
Doch ich bin eine wunderschöne Frau

Ich seh's an deinem jeglicher Gelassenheit beraubten Blick
Du glaubst mir nicht und hältst es für einen faulen Trick
Dabei sind meine Lippen doch schon Taub vom Stift
Und ich trage ein Hauch von Nichts
Halt dein Maul pscht, glaub mir diese Titten sind echt,
Fass sie ruhig an aber vorsicht mit dem spitzen Besteck
Was stört dich denn?
Ist es das Kurzhaar?
Unter der Burka?
Oder mein Schnurrbart?
Ich bin die Venus der Herzen, mache nur was Damen machen
Ist auch der Adamsapfel groß wie ein Fahrradsattel
Bin ich dir nicht schön genug? (Doch, doch doch)
Seh' ich dick in dem Kleid aus? (Nein!)
Oder hängt wieder mein Dick aus dem Kleid raus?
Wenn wir über Weiberthemen streiten
Kommt es öfter mal zu Kneipenschlägereien
Es gab leider Hefeweizen
Willst du mich jetzt diskriminieren
Nur weil ich zum Stressabbau, Leuten in die Fresse hau?
Das ist mein Recht als Frau
„Willkommen in Little Germany“

Ist es der eiserne Arm
Oder der Dreitagebart
Oder mein kleiner Pirat, ich geb 'nen Scheiß, was ihr sagt
Ich sehe ungewöhnlich aus
Doch ich bin eine wunderschöne Frau

Ich bedanke mich mit einem selbst gebackenen Streusel-Quiche
Du machst ein Schmatz-Geräusch zu viel, das bedeutet Krieg
Ah, ja ich hasse Deutsch-MCs, es gibt Asiklatsche
Während sie an der Wasserpfeife ziehen
Komm zum Battle, deine Waffen sind 'ne Rachenfäule
Und auf mich mit Wattebäuschen zielen, das bedeutet Krieg
So lang mein Haschverkäufer dealt
Rauch' ich wie ein Apachenhäuptling Piece und meine Nase muss wie Ackergäule zieh'n
Wenn man noch Schnaps ins Feuer gießt, krieg' ich Hassgefühle
Wenn man mir das Kraftfahrzeug entzieht, das bedeutet Krieg

Ich spiele mit Hoffnung und deale den Stoff
Ihr fragt euch sicher warum macht er diesen schwierigen Job?

Da habe ich beschlossen reich zu werden

Guten Morgen, der feine Herr Gatoah

Ich bin ein Phänomen, ich bin 10 von 10
Geometrisch perfekt, wie ein LEGO-Face
Ich hab' den YouTuber-Look, wie im Buch und gedruckt
Jeden Tag fress' ich ein neues Beautyprodukt
Ich schütze mich, denn ich lese nie die Preisschilder
Sie dulden keine negativen Weibsbilder
Und sie dulden keine Gesichtsfalten
Michael Jackson Style, ich muss Schritt halten
Also trag' ich noch mehr Schichten auf
Wer will schon 'ne ehrliche Haut?
Mein Lieblingsrohstoff (ey) Botox
Ich hole alle Preise, sie nennen mich Hohl-kopf
Ey yo, Spieglein, Spieglein im Handy, sag mir bin ich der King?
Der Spiegel zögert verlegen, dann beginnt er zu singen

Du bist schön, aber dafür kannst du nichts
Weder Lesen, noch Schreiben, noch was anderes
Du bist schön, aber dafür kannst du nichts
Du kannst nicht mal was dafür, dafür kannst du nichts

Im Frühling denkt das Röslein
Wer nicht leiden will, muss schön sein

Das versteh' ich nicht
Dabei geb' ich mir doch Mühe, jede Luxus-Modemesse gibt mir Komplimente
Schöne Benutzeroberfläche! Und sie machen mir ein Angebot, das Freude weckt
99% Reduziert auf mein Äußeres
Ich muss in die Sachen passen, hab' ich Hunger, gibt es Kochwäsche
Manche tragen nur dieselben Schrottfetzen
Ich trag' jeden Tag was anderes Stoffwechsel
Frag nicht, wie alt die sind, die meine Kleider nähen
Auf einer Skala von eins bis zehn
Tja, denn Kleider machen Leute, doch die Leute, die die Kleider machen
Leisten sich bis heute leider weniger Designerjacken
Ich schweife ab - Spieglein im Handy: Bin ich der King?

Denn Freundschaften werden Alltagssorgen
Zieh' ich in den kalten Norden
Und hast du dein erstes Balg geworfen
Wenn wir uns seh'n, knall'n die Korken, ich bin breit vom Alk
Mein Heiratsantrag ist ironisch im Zweifelsfall
Wahrheitsgehalt macht meine Antwort konsequent
Wenn der Kellner fragt, zusammen oder getrennt?
Alles endet und da kennt dieses Leben keine Skrupel, die Schlampe
Bevor ich Bruder und Tante verlier', nenn' ich sie gute Bekannte

Einmal den Boden berührt hat, ist bedeutungslos und stinkt
Ich lass es lieber liegen, lieber neue Waren statt verwahren
Nur muss ich jetzt beim Einkaufen Atemmaske tragen
Lieber liege ich im Gras, erfrischt den Geist, erfrischt die Lunge
Bis ich merke, ich liege in aufgeweichten Kippenstummeln
Hörst du nicht den Vogel singen, er zwitschert Lobeshymnen
Auf die Seen in denen sogar die Fische oben schwimmen
Hörst du nicht die schöne Möwe über der Ölfabrik
Ich würde gern verstehen, was sie sagt töte mich!

Bei so billigem Zeug ist es nicht nötig, meinen Kram zu schleppen
Nach meinem Picknick mit Friteusen und Massagesesseln
Man kann mich durch die Spur von leeren Plastikhüllen orten
Sie führt zum Mediamarkt, ich kaufe den Müll von morgen
Und lass ihn liegen, weil ich lieber in das Beachhotel geh
Guck' mal, Jutta, da schwimmt unsre alte Mikrowelle
Auch wenn wir sonst die Urlaubsreise klasse finden
Sollte man hier nicht das Leitungswasser trinken
Die Einheimischen strahlen, hier nur haben sie die Hände an den Rippen
Husten endlos lang und zittern, and're Länder, and're Sitten
Langsam brauch ich, auch wenn Umwelt leidet um den Preis zu retten
Dringend neue Gummistiefel, denn die Deiche brechen

Kritische Texte, Weltverbesserer-Blues;
Du denkst du gibst dem System eine Reparatur
Unterschätzt dabei nur das Gesetz der Natur
Denn wir, kommen mit Kohlekraft
Dem Monopol der Macht, mit Munition en Masse
Durch Korruption ergattertem Logen-Platz
Du kommst mit Notenblatt, wir haben uns tot gelacht! (Guck ma')
David gegen Goliath
Ist aus 'nem Märchenbuch voller erlogenem Quatsch
Bevor du Feuer bei der Generation entfachst
Fahren wir Hovercraft durch eine Mondlandschaft
Ein Anti-Kriegs-Klangerzeugnis?
Pff, ganz was Neues
John Lennon hat das schon in den 70ern gemacht
Hat ja richtig was gebracht

Du machst ein Lied, gegen die gemeine Welt
Und in China hat gerade jemand Reis bestellt
Dann kommt der Krieg wieder, dann begreifst du schnell:
Musik ist keine Lösung
Die Melodie löst bei ihnen Hoffnung aus
Heute hebt das Festivalgesocks die Faust
Aber morgen wachen sie in ihrer Kotze auf
Musik ist keine Lösung

Was willst du? Menschen mit deinen Liedern tragen
Von der schiefen Bahn zur Zivilcourage?
Über allen Krisen-Staaten Friedensfahnen?
Willst du noch 'ne Niere haben?
Denkst du, du bist jetzt die Stimme der Gesellschaft?
Die finden dich solange cool, bis du Geld hast
Vielleicht wirst du von manchen für den mutigen Schritt geliebt
Andere sagen: Der will doch nur gute Publicity!
Nein, es ist nicht leicht, du musst Gegenwind verkraften
Zweifelhafte Leute aus der falschen Ecke werden für die nächste Single klatschen
Zum Beispiel Anzug-getarnte, rechtsextremgesinnte Spasten
Die dein Video posten weil sie kalkulierte Jagd auf jugendliche Wählerstimmen machen
Klar, denn keiner versteht deine Texte nach einer Jever-Palette
Du hast mehr Schnapsleichen auf dem Gewissen, als Leben gerettet
Die Satire wirst du schwer im Dorf erläutern
Es sind Perlen vor die Säufer
Schenk den Menschen Botschaften und dein Temperament
Sie werden nur darüber streiten wer dich länger kennt
Glaub mal nicht das da irgendetwas hängenbleibt
Außer dem Download der MP3

Die Denunzianten von Nebenan

Die Karriere-Schlampen, die Laserschranken
Die Toxygensubstanzen die in den Meeren landen
Der Planet geht baden doch wir gehen zusammen!
Schenk dir ein und du siehst, dich bemerkt keiner
Das Glas ist halb-leer, Meister
Erlaub dem Zweifel deinen Kopf zu ficken
Denn es steckt immernoch Mist in jedem Optimisten
Mach's wie wir, uns ist die Schöpfung latte
Wenn Gott nur sieben Tage braucht kann er's ja öfters machen
Stampf Gitarre, und Schreibfüller ein
Du wirst unbesiegbar durch Gleichgültigkeit
Nichts ist mehr schlimm, und verwerflich
Nimm dir ein Zimmer mit Meerblick
Während sich unten das Gesindel beerdigt
Gib die Menschheit ich bin noch nicht fertig
Gib die Menschheit auf, Kaliba du verschwendest deine Kunst

I will raise you from your sleep
I will kiss you in four places
As I go running along your street

I will squeeze the life out of you
You will make me laugh and make me cry
And we will never forget
You will make me call your name,
And I'll shout it out to the blue summer sky

And we may never meet again
So shed your skin and let's get started
And you will throw your arms around me
Yeah, you will throw your arms around me

I dreamed of you at night-time
And I watched you in your sleep

I met you in high places
I touched your head
And touched your feet

So if you disappear out of view,
You know I will never say goodbye
And though I try to forget it,
You will make me call your name
And I'll shout it out to the blue summer sky

And we may never meet again,
So shed your skin and let's get started
And you will throw your arms around me
Yeah, you will throw your arms around me

Allison Crowe,"I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?

It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Maybe I've been here before
I've seen this room, I've walked this floor 
I used to live alone before I knew you

I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

There was a time you let me know
What's real and going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?

And remember when I moved in you?
The holy dark was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you

And it's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah

Allison Crowe,"In the bleak midwinter, frost wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow
In the bleak midwinter, long ago

Our God, heaven cannot hold him, nor earth sustain
Heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ

Angels and archangels may have gathered there
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air
But his mother only, in her maiden bliss
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss

What can I give him, poor as I am
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb
If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part
Yet what I can I give him: give my heart",In the Bleak Midwinter

Allison Crowe,"This circus is falling down on its knees
The big top is crumbling down
It's raining in Baltimore fifty miles east
Where you should be, no one's around

I need a phone call
I need a raincoat
I need a big love
I need a phone call

These train conversations are passing me by
And I don't have nothing to say
You get what you pay for
But I just had no intention of living this way

I need a phone call
I need a plane ride
I need a sunburn
I need a raincoat

And I get no answers
And I don't get no change
It's raining in Baltimore, baby
But everything else is the same

There's things I remember and things I forget
I miss you
I guess that I should
Three thousand five hundred miles away
But what would you change if you could?

I need a phone call
Maybe I should buy a new car
I can always hear a freight train
If I listen real hard
And I wish it was a small world
Because I'm lonely for the big towns
I'd like to hear a little guitar
I think it's time to put the top down

I need a phone call
I need a raincoat",Raining in Baltimore
Allison Crowe,"The First Noel, the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! 

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind has bought.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Allison Crowe,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord,

And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Wrapped in strands of fist and bone
Curiosity, Kitten, doesn't have to mean you're on your own
Your can look outside your window
He doesn't have to know
We can talk awhile, baby
We can take it nice and slow

All your life is such a shame
All your love is just a dream

Are you happy where you're sleeping?
Does he keep you safe and warm?
Does he tell you when you're sorry?
Does he tell you when you're wrong?
I've been watching you for hours
It's been years since we were born
We were perfect when we started
I've been wondering where we've gone

All your life is such a shame
All your love is just a dream

I dreamt I saw you walking up a hillside in the snow
Casting shadows on the winter sky as you stood there counting crows
One for sorrow
Two for joy
Three for girls and four for boys
Five for silver
Six for gold and
Seven for a secret never to be told

There's a bird that nests inside you
Sleeping underneath your skin
When you open up your wings to speak
I wish you'd let me in

All your life is such a shame
All your love is just a dream
Open up your eyes
You can see the flames
of your wasted life
You should be ashamed

You don't want to waste your life

Oh I could drink a case of you darling

Allison Iraheta,"You texted me to say you made a mistake
Couldn't say it face to face
You thought you wanted her and got what you deserved
Now look who's getting played

They say karma comes around
Used to want you, but I don't now

Roses are dry, violets are black
And I can be cruel, just like you
The tables have turned, can't help but laugh
For saying we're through, just like you

You hit me up again to tell me I'm the one
But I just hit erase
'Cause I'm so over it, finally having fun
So drama go away

They say heartache heals in time
Whoever they are, they were right

Roses are dry, violets are black
And I can be cruel, just like you
The tables have turned, can't help but laugh
For saying we're through, just like you

Tell me was she worth
Was she worth letting me go
Shovel in your hand
And you dug yourself a hole
Now you're coming back
Just to hear me tell you no

Got myself to blame for 
My difficult days and my difficult ways 
But you, you know how to let things slide

There's simply no one else in the world I could ever find
Likes me when I'm low and still tolerates me when I'm high
You, you got me down
You kept coming round
There's simply no one else I could lean on a thousand times
Still be there again, and again and never lose his mind

I don't need you to save me

Why can't you let me hit the ground?

Allison Iraheta,"Did I say something stupid?
There goes one more mistake
Do I bore you with my problems?
Is that why you turn away?
Do you know how hard I tried
To become what you want me to be?

Take me
This is all that I've got
This is all that I'm not
All that I'll ever be
I've got flaws, I've got faults
Keep searching for your perfect heart
It doesn't matter who you are
We all have our scars
We all have our scars

You say don't act like a child
But what if its a father I need?
Its not like you don't know what you got yourself into
Don't tell me I'm the one who's naive
Do you know how hard I've tried
To become who you want me to be?

This is all that I'm not
All that I'll ever be

We all have our scars

Come on, just let it go
These are things you can't control
Your expectations, your explanations
Don't make sense to me
You and your alternatives
Don't send me to your therapists
Deep down, I know what you mean
And I'm not sure that's what I wanna be
No

Allison Iraheta,"I need an aspirin after you
Until you left I never knew what my heart was really going through
And I never wanna go back but if there's some sick twist of fate
I would rather rest in peace please do not resuscitate 

I'm still breathing. 
Don't you think I'm not 
Because you're leaving? 
Never gonna see me grieving 
I'm moving up and away. 
Not crying 
Funny I'm not even trying
Never gonna lay down 
I'm breathing much better 
The air is much clearer over you

Suffocating, and I didn't know why
Until I realized you were standing in the way of my air supply
Clear the air, was about to die
I wonder why I didn't leave you way before so I thought I was insane
But it was you who kept the oxygen from getting to my brain

I'm still breathing. 
Don't you think I'm not 
Because you're leaving? 
Never gonna see me grieving

Breathing so much better

So easily into you
If I let myself go
I could let
My wildest dream come true
You never know
How it's gonna wind up in the end
Will we be lovers or not even friends?

Trouble is,
I like the taste too much and I can't think straight
People change,
And will you still be here after today
Trouble is,
I feel like I could win or lose it all
I don't know which way to fall

Don't forget, the promises that we made
When I got on the plane
We'd be back together once again
And we would stay the same

But sometimes I think forever is the thing of the past

I'm a voice you didn't wanna hear
I'm a page of a book that you read to fast,

You never cared never tried never even asked,
Maybe I didn't wanna say
You shut your eyes told your lies and you had your laugh
And that's okay

Cause you don't know me
You don't wanna know what's real
And I'm not sorry
For who I am for what I feel, cause you don't know me.

I got more on my mind that I've never told
I've got pain that you've never felt
I've got the scars I can deal with it on my own
I've got stories that I'd never tell.
But maybe it's just as well 

[Chorus]

I'm strong, I'm a mess altogether an emotional wreck
I can scream I can beg you to see I'm alive
I'm awake I'm unglued
I'm not gonna break down, no.

You don't wanna know what's real

Where the trees grow tall and green
I'd like to see the gulf of Mexico

Where the skies shine bright and blue
I'd like to see the old Tombigbee
If you're going, I want to go with you

Are you going to Alabama
Where the folks say ""how do you do""
I'd like to see those big ol' cotton fields
If you're going, I'm going too

I'm ready to run, baby
Through the sweet southern pines
Lie down in a bed of camellias
And watch the sun shine

But if you're going to California
That's alright, any place will do
Well, I guess I just want to go with you",Alabama Song
