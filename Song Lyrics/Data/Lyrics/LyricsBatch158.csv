Haddaway,"Baby, if you'd understand,
I would Like to be your man
In change of your love, of your love, of your love,
And, baby, when we find the time and place,
I just hope it's not too late,
Really, baby, must we wait, must we wait, must we wait?

Let's do it now, I'm coming, I'm coming, let's do it now
Let's do it now, I'm coming, I'm coming, let's do it now

I've pictured, pictured same nights with you
Once a week will never do.
Give me love, give me love, give me love
I'm waiting, waiting fou your touch
A simple kiss is not enough
Give me love, give me love, give me love

Let's do it now, I'm coming, I'm coming, let's do it now
Let's do it now, I'm coming, I'm coming, let's do it now

Testing testing call me number three,
What I want is just for you to be with me,
One time, two times, even in the night,
Baby, baby, gonna pack your bags,
You wanna walk out the door and leave me all alone.
I got to get my love.
I got to keep my home,
Sitting in the corner,
Waiting all alone,
Baby, you got to come home.

Let's do it now, I'm coming, I'm coming, let's do it now
Let's do it now, I'm coming, I'm coming, let's do it now",Let's Do It Now

Say there are always two sides of a story

And time didn't heal my wounds at all
I wonder, if you know what I'm going through
All the lonely times that we're apart

I miss you, oh I miss you
I'm gonna need you more and more each day
I miss you, more than words can say

Saying sorry was a question of my pride
Pride can push aside a loving heart,
In the end emotion has ruled my mind
And I'm asking for a second start

mean, but I know, every day

And I'll love you with a love so tender
And if you let me stay, I'll love all the hurt away
Why is that sad look in you eyes

Why are you crying
Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me why you're feeling this way
I hate to see you so down

Oh, baby is it your heart
Ooh, breakin' all in pieces
Makin' you cry
Makin' you feel blue

I'll do my best to make the tears all go away

Just tell me where it hurts now, tell me
And I'll love you with a love so tender
And if you let me stay, I'll love all the hurt away
Girl tell me, where are all those tears coming from

Why are they fallin'
Did somebody somebody leave your heart in the cold
You just need somebody to hold
Give me a chance to put back all the pieces, take your broken heart
Make it just like new

There's so many things that I can do
Why don't you tell me where it hurts now baby
And I'll do my best to make it better
I'll do my best to make the tears all go away

Just tell me where it hurts now, tell me

And if you let me stay I'll love all the hurt away
Baby, if you'd only tell me where it hurts I know I can make it better

If I could wrap my arms around your heart
I'd would hold you tight, and let you know everything is gonna be alright
So take a chance with me baby
I don't wanna see you cry

Haddaway,"There are moments in our lives
When everyting goes right
And we're making love
Endless love
And then we have all these days
Where we go separate ways
A heart full of pain
And no one's to blame
It's just another day
Without you
Without you
It's just another day
Without you
Without you
Many times we throw away
What we regret the next day
And we say Good-Bye
Forever Good-Bye!!
And I don't know wht it is
Just a game of hit and miss?
I wonder how long
We can go on?

We gotta breakaway

Modern people
Want to live in a modern life
Though they trick and take
Rip and rape
Destroy the things that are right
They came to my town
I was a boy
Just about five
Today we demonstrate, litigate
Even show our might

Breakaway
I wanna know just what it is
We gotta breakaway

Race colour

She was a right wing
I was a left
Together we're strong
We will crucify
Just plain denied
To practice out our rights
Those were the bad days
Today we're rich
And we have kids
But they didn't learn
Through all the hurt
The meaning of our might

Breakaway
I wanna know just what it is
We gotta breakaway

You know it's in our past
We had to sacrifice a lot
It was give and take
For the human race
Just learning right from wrong
They put it in our minds
And now they're putting it in your
So learn to fight the hate
For the human race
Or we're lost

Wandering, where is home
She cries, mother
Father, all alone
Where is hipe she prays
A bowl of food could buy
Another day
She wants to fly away
Look at me
Got shoes I never wear
Look at me
Got Fancy clothes I tear
Time to eat
Leave half and just don't care
Cause I never have to hear the 
Echoes of the desert prayer
Night falls, darkness
Hunger meets the cold
She's just seven
Her eyes are old
Where is God today
His messenger's asleep in satin
Sheets his love's so far away
Yeah, I've got friends to spare
I've got Dreams 
Got castles in the air
Broken hearts
Are my only care
Cause I never have to hear the 
Echoes of a desert prayer
Lord don't take my hope away
Don't take my hope

And another place and time

Nothing is revealed

Fly away, you can leave it all behind you
I'm on my way to find you
And I'll soon be flying too
Fly away, we can fly away together
I'm talking 'bout forever
This is all we gotta do
Fly away

It's a tangled up emotion
Will you stay or will you go
I am the one to count on
If only you could know

Fly away, you can leave it all behind you

And I'll soon be flying too

You took my heart forever
Bring back what we had

Take the good from bad

Bring back my memories
Of sunshine and laughter
Bring back my memories
Of joy and this feeling inside

Let the sun shine again

And lips so soft

Then change your ways

But she walks away
I give her all the time I can

It's out of my hands

There's a Big difference between assisting the truly needy 
And throwing the taxpayers' money at 
Problems with the noble hope that they'll disappear. 
Earning more short term votes all the While. 
Never once thinking about the
Big picture or the future of our children.
Selfish suicide, selfish suicide.

The United States of America taxed and legislated itself both on the
Federal and state levels into utter bankruptcy and eventual anarchy.
Anerica the beautifully forsaken. 
Finished off in Exquisite catastrophe.
Like Egypt and Rome before it, the USA advanced its living conditions 
To the point where total apathy consumed its hard working citizens and government 
Assistance did nothing but enslave the downtrodden to the powers that were.
One nation under God, totally divisible.

I. Red Death
It was a time when life was short
Long devastated was the land
Never had there ever been
A more fatal plague against all man
Pungent pain, sudden faintness
Your energy begins to fade
As you stand there somewhat daunted
You know 'Red Death' is on it's way
Blood, blood, blood and more blood
Profuse bleeding at the pores
You watch your blood slowly sizzle
As your flesh dissolves some more
Screams of anguish, blood still flowing
Pollutes the ground a rotten red
Your time has come, you must meet your maker
As you slip into the valley of the shadow of death
II. The Prince's Master Plan
All men feared this great disaster
But the valiant Prince had the only answer
For his majesty and his chosen ones
The inception of new life would free them of contagion
Magnificent it was this structure of seclusion
Surrounded by these walls so massive yet elusive
The gates were welded shut impervious to those forsaken
Never letting go of the souls that were taken
There was beauty, there was wine
Ambrosia and sweet nectar
Flowing from within
All appliances of pleasure
Inside the Master-Plan
Providing noble lunacy
Outside the palace gates
'Red Death' just sits and waits for you
Narration:
It was toward the close of the fifth or
Sixth month of his seclusion, and while the
Pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that
The Prince Prospreo entertained his thousand
Friends at a masked ball of the most unusual
Magnificence... Edgar Allen Poe (1809-1849)
III. The Masquerade including the Twelfth Hour and Return of the Red Death
Bizzare it was seven chambers
Held this jubilee except for one
It stood alone, the western wing
Where no one shared it's offerings
Blood tinted panes, brazier or fire
Projects it's rays
A clock stands tall, ominous
It warns of death so soon to be
So loud, so deep the guests pay heed
The dissonant ring of ebony
The crowd goes pale as darkness
Shrouds the maskers in their revelry
Then as the echos ceased
A light laughter spread through the assembly
And all is well
Until the next chiming of old ebony
The ebony clock struck the twelfth hour
And everyting ceased as the revellers cowered
The pendulum swings all still, all silent
Save the voice of old ebony
As the last chime died and sunk into silence
Soon it was felt a presence so strange
Tall and gaunt who is this masked figure
Shrouded in habiliments of the grave?
His blood splattered mask bore a striking resemblance
The countenance of a rigid corpse
He stalked to and fro in a slow, solemn movement
Enraging the Duke, invasion of his sanctuary
'Seize him, unmask him, ' commanded the prince
'Who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery?
You'll hang at sunrise! '
Not a person came forth it seemed like all was lost
As the intruder make his way unimpeded
An anon he went on trugged through each chamber
Where the music once swelled and the dreams lived on and on
The prince in pursuit dagger drawn aloft
As the figure retreats to the seventh chamber
He suddenly turns, a piercing sharp cry
Now the Prince lay dead in the hall of the velvet...
Then summoning the wild courage of despair,
A throng of revellers at once threw themselves
Into the black apartment, and seizing the mummer,
Whose tall dark figure stood erect and motionless
Within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped
In unutterable horror at finding the grave
Cerements and corpse-like mask, which they
Handled with so violent a rudeness, untenated
By any tangible form.
And now was acknowlegded the presence
Of the Red Death. He had come as a thief
In the night and one by one droppd the revellers
In the blood-bedewed halls of their revel,
And died each in the despairing posture of his fall.
As the life of the ebony clock went out
With that the last of the gay.
And the flames of the tripods expired. And Darkness
And Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all...
Edgar Allen Poe (1809-1849)

Clutching ornamented bronze and steel

As the life drops from his eyes
Shining the weapon as his entrails fall
Splattering upon the floor
Ripping up the pieces of nerves that keep his limbs from dying
Twitching as if still alive

Slowly slumping to the floor
Smearing all the blood along his fingertips
And watching where the deadman and his body lie
Stands atop his kill

Guarding over it triumphantly
The streets are filled with laughter

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon

Versorg' Junkies mit Koks, fick' Collien
Und trainier' nur Muskeln, die man in der Disco sieht
Der deutsche Mr. T, Gerichtstermin, Anklagebank
Weil sich im Wandschrank das Hanf und 'ne Pumpgun befand
Verteil' an Samstagen Schwanz oder ganz harte Punch's

Milonair, ich verleih dem Ghetto 'ne Stimme
In diesem Sinne sind nicht mal die Sterne mein Limit
Ein Bruder von ganz unten dreht im Benz seine Runden
Vertickt Flex an die Kunden, an Banker und an Nutten
Ah, Männer in Kutten spalten dir den Schädel auf
Die Straße schrieb sehr viel Scheiße in mein' Lebenslauf
Schau, sie kommen jetzt, alle wollen Milos Schutz
Jeder schiebt hier dicke Eier, überall wird aufgemuckt
Bleib mal locker, lan, lass mal die Babas ran
Ich schlachte die Opfer wie Moslems an Bayram
Perser, Kurden, Schweden oder Türken
Nuttensöhne kriegen von mir Schläge mit'm Gürtel

Durch Westberlin im 6er fliehen, Lak, Zeit bedeutet Kohle
Champions-League-Gangsters, die Geld verdienen wie Michael Corleone
Ey, wenn die Nachtigall hier fliegt, wird es gefährlich, wo ich wohne
Tacharias in meinem Kiez durchsuchen jeden hier nach Drogen
Lose Scheine in deiner Jeans werden so eben mal entzogen
3-6 Riders bleibt mein Team, ich hol uns nebenbei die Krone
Ich bin die 1 jetzt in Berlin und hab auf gar kein' Fall Idole
Gib mir das Mic, ich bin MC Mosh für mich geht es nur nach oben
Moet-Rosé-Rap, Lak, ich zieh Hasen aus Zylindern
Sprech die Sprache der Straße, weil ich mit Ware hier Gewinn mach
Ja, die Lage ist behindert, denn die meisten hier sind abgespaced
8 von 10 auf Hasch und Haze, ich platz ins Game wie Haftbefehl

Um zu sehen, wer der Babo ist
Will ich seh'n, dass du in die Bank gehst mit der Uzi und dir alles nimmst
Ob da ein Wachmann ist, keine Ahnung, ich
Will nur Taler sehen, denn 500 reichen nicht
Sie weiß, wer ihr Peso ist , denn wenn das Para stimmt
Kannst du dir sicher sein, dass es nix besseres als Scheine gibt
Ja, du Schwätz-Gangster, es ist FFM
Chabos wissen, wo die Kunden fixen, ohne Witze, alles wird zerrissen
Blockplatin, also was los, du Martin?
Spreng dein Kartell mit den Bratans und Abis
Brate, schnapp dir die Navis, Brate, bring sie zur Basis
Denn wenn's klar ist, es ist sicher, dass die Ware bezahlt ist

Ich bin Partisan, scheiß' euren Party-Wahn und Amiland
Ich war nie da, Habesha, Nordostafrika
Wir machen's klar, Para var, wenn nicht, dann heißt es Attentat
Überfall, Hände hoch, Kohle her, Landesbank
Von Anfang an, Zahn um Zahn, Ghetto-Fang, Straßen-Clan
Mittelfinger hoch für jeden Zinker 31er
40er, Düsseldorfer Junge, ich bin radikal
Echte Babos in der Hood brauchen keine Bodyguards
Kugeln in dein Arsch, Rapper machen ein' auf hart
Du bist Gangster in dein' Parts, auf der Straße niemals
Doch vergiss mal diese Kinder, wen interessieren sie schon?
Ich schrei
Freiheit Palästina! Netanjahu, Hundesohn

Jeder will der Babo sein, Pablo-Style
Akho, nein, du bist nicht Rambo 3
Ess dein Magnum-Eis, der Maroc zeigt
Wie man Alben schreibt, also schweig
Des Bizz wurd gebumst, eova, komm klar
Ich bring's auf'n Punkt wie Laserpointer
A Doppel Z, Rap-Flasheffekt wie LSD,
Abderrahim,

Jag Kunden im Lacoste Anzug drin
Mach Money, ich bin doper als das Radsport-Biz
Armstrong Lance, Konkurrenz wird abgerippt
Klatsch, Boom, Bang, Street-Fighter-Hadouken
Spackos sind still, wenn ich 'n Machtwort sprech'
Während du Schwanz nuckelst für 'ne Handvoll Haze
Entweder mit Bartstoppeln im Knast rumhängen
Oder in Saint Tropez am Strand rumfick'n
Was los, Bitch, DOE, HB
Chabos wissen, wer der Babo ist

Chabos wissen, wer der Babo ist, ich bin der, der Rambo fickt
Dieser Greco, der im Ghetto Haze oder Hazro tickt
Wer fickt Chuck Norris, der Nutten kriegt ein Messerstich
Ernster Blick und Boxerschnitt heißt nicht, dass du ein Gangster bist
Du Hund kennst mich nicht, 60/60 brettert dich
Keiner gibt dir mehr die Hand, weil du wie ein Penner stinkst
Wenn ich auf Sendung bin, nehm' ich dir die Packs weg
Mach keine Action, denn
Chabos wissen, wer der Babo ist, hallo, Miss Mademoiselle
Guck mal, wie mein Sakko sitzt, maßgeschneidert, Ralph Lauren
Ich will Bargeld seh'n, Taschen voller Narcotic
Ich zieh' Lines auf Marmorfließen und lass mir den Schwanz lutschen

Chabos wissen, wer der Babo ist, los, hol dir 'ne Unterschrift
Doch eigentlich interessiert mich viel mehr, wer deine Mutter ist
Immer in der Sauna, natürlich ohne Handtuch
Kahbas sehen mein Sip und sagen, schau mal, Shampoo
Frisch aus der Haftanstalt, labert wie ein Wasserfall
Vor Gericht, danach fick ich die Tochter vom Staatsanwalt
Scheiß auf Arbeit, ich lieg' lieber faul auf dem Sofa
Und schreib keine Bewerbung, Al-Qaida macht auch so klar
Guck mich an, alleine in die Charts geschafft
Denn letztes Jahr noch saß dieser Star in Haft
Als ich rauskam', tickte ich Koks an die Stars mit Haft
Mittlerweile gehör ich selbst zu den Stars mit Haft

Uzis ziehen, Headshots, Blut fließt wie Ketchup
Altendorfer Jugend ist bella und echt krass
Zieh dem Kolumbianer sein Flex ab
Dem Zuhi den 6er mit allen Extras
Du arbeitest für Almanya, du sitzt auf Dildos
Bingöl on Iki, Zaza ohne Bildung
Will bloß aus der dritten Welt raus und starten
Entweder Rap oder Geldautomaten
Und Benz-Autos fahren, 4-3er Terrorkids
Nachts auf den Straßen, Koka- und Hero-Biz
Sitzen jetzt Jahre, weil Richter bestrafen
Gesichter voll Narben, von Wichsern verraten
Doch keiner gab mir die Hand wie mein Bruder Aykut
Doch ich schwöre ihm dafür, dass Deutsch-Rap jetzt Blei schluckt

Da rutscht ihm das Seil - oh
Da rutscht ihm das Seil aus der Hand!
Er hat sich seine Finger halb erfroren
Und hat alle Freunde -
Alle miteinander verloren.
Er hat seine ganzen Freunde verloren,

Und in der Disco tanzen sie wie die Wilden,
Der allerbeste kriegt den erste Preis.
Doch er hängt noch in der Wand
Und hat den ersten Preis in seiner
Haberfrorenen Hand -
- Als erster Preis - ein Edelweiß!
Das ist ihm jetzt schon oft passiert,
Daß er auf einen Schlag alle Freunde verliert.
Dabei hat alles so gut angefangen
Bis auf das rutschige Seil in seiner Hand.
Er hat seine besten Freunde verloren,

Ganz verbissen um den erste Preis...

Håkan Hellström,"Nu lyser ängarna av sommarns alla blommor. 
Nu surrar bin, och fåglar sjunger överallt. 
Nu stryker vinden genom trädens höga kronor 
Men I min trädgård är det visset, mörkt och kallt. 
Här är det risigt och förvuxet, fult och snårigt 
Och lika hopplöst trist och grått som I mitt bröst. 
Därute doftar det av sommarns alla dofter. 
Där är det sommar, men här inne är det höst.
Jag levde lycklig här med dig och mina katter 
Ett liv I synd och utan omsorg att bli frälst. 
Försonad med min karaktär, för jag har aldrig 
Kunnat säga nej till någonting som helst. 
Och aldrig nekat mig det ena eller andra, 
Och levat livet, tills jag krossades en dag. 
Det börja med att do bedrog mig med en annan, 
En som do sa var mycket finare än jag.
Vårt gräl tog veckor, ropen blandades med gråten 
Och jag blev grundligt jämförd med din fina vän 
Tills do bekände att han givit dig på båten 
Då blev det dödstyst här I trädgården igen! 
Ifrån den stunden blev den mannen dubbelt hatad 
Han hade lekt med dig, med oss ett litet slag 
Och jag, jag kände det som även jag var ratad 
Jag ville slåss, och gick mot mitt livs nederlag
Jag hade hammaren beredd under kavajen 
När han kom ut I sidenscarf och sa: God dag! 
Kom in och slå dig ner en stund så får vi prata! 
Jag bara stammade, nu minns jag inte vad... 
Och jag blev bjuden på cognac och på cigarrer 
Och kunde inte få mig till att säga nej! 
Och när vi skiljdes var vi bästisar och bundis 
Och jag tog saker som do glömt med hem till dig!
Jag går omkring I mitt pompeji, bland ruiner 
Och jag trampar runt I resterna utav vårt liv 
Men do skall aldrig ge mig pikar om sekiner 
Och aldrig skall do bli en annans tidsfördriv! 
Nej, åt det gamla skall vi binda vackra kransar 
Och ta vårt liv och mina katter som de är. 
Och trots all kärleksbrist och trasighet och fransar; 
Dig skall jag älska livet ut, dig har jag kär!",Trubbel
Håkan Hellström,"Det går en vind över vindens ängar,

Till jag började med Tequila och blev trummis I en ny orkester
Och sen sa dem på Pååls att några skulle gå
Och det betydde Karl-Johan, Andreas och jag
Jag hade inga barn då, men Karl-Johan hade två
Så det tog hårt på honom

Det var nästan alltid svart I tankarna på Långedragspaviljongen
Där jag nästan alltid satt med pensionärerna under båtsäsongen
Och vi såg på de unga och glömska, I båtar och I varandras armar
Och tänkte ""skuld och lidande väntar på er fortfarande""

Jag har gått på knä så många år I den här staden
Men jag svär att jag hörde Frälsningsarmén sjunga om att lämna allt
Bakom sig, första gången jag såg dig
Och jag svär att jag hörde lastbilar från E4:an dundra förbi där utanför
Natten vi kysste all skit vi gått igenom här adjö

Lena ville ifrån kranarna och indieklubbarna
Det var då Lena, nu vill jag alltid stanna
Och min lille son ler mot manshororna
När vi går förbi hand I hand, åh Fiskekyrkan
Åh, ändå Hurricane
När de skrev om mig I tidningen sa du som det var
""Glöm mig aldrig Håkan, parkbänken är aldrig långt borta""

Men den gamla goda tiden, nu kommer den aldrig tillbaka
Men jag svär att varenda fyllo på varenda bänk I varenda hörn

Love was a star, a song unsung

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

On merely this, a look, a kiss

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Hal Ketchum,"There are dreams that come to me in the night
And some are precious and fine
Lately all of my dreams of you are the hurtin' kind
Lyin' beside you, I miss the heat and I feel so alone
I'm afraid if I fall asleep you'll be gone

When it's late at night and I close my eyes
I know what I'll be dreamin' of
See the flames go high, watch the ashes fly
As you strike a match to the book of love
Honey, don't strike a match to the book of love

Imagination will run so wild, I can't believe that it's true
And I don't want to imagine me without you

When it's late at night and I close my eyes
I know what I'll be dreamin' of
See the flames go high, watch the ashes fly
As you strike a match to the book of love

When it's late at night and I close my eyes
I know what I'll be dreamin' of

Hal Ketchum,"Up ev'ry morning just to keep a job
I gotta fight my way through the hustling mob,
Sounds of the city pounding in my brain
While another day goes down the drain.
But it's a five o'clock world when the whistle blows,
No one owns a piece of my time.
And there's a five o'clock me inside my clothes,
Thinking that the world looks fine. Yeah!  Adalee!
 
Trading my time for the pay I get
Living on the money that I ain't made yet,
Gotta keep goin' gotta make my way 
But I live for the end of the day.
'Cause it's a five o'clock world when the whistle blows,
No one owns a piece of my time.
And there's a long haired girl who waits, I know,
To ease my troubled mind. Yeah! Adalee!
 
In the shelter of her arms ev'rything's o.k.
She talks and the world goes slipping away,
And I know the reason I can still go on 
When ev'ry other reason is gone.
In my five o'clock world she waits for me,
Nothing else matters at all.

I know that it's all worthwhile, yeah",Five O'Clock World
Hal Ketchum,"Love don't hang out in a grand hotel
Got no satin sheets, got no servant's bell
Ain't in Bel Air on some big old yacht
Ain't in a beach house on Montserrat

It's a little old, it's a little run down
Full of laughter and tears and toys
Crazy things only love enjoys

I know where love lives
I know where love lives
She's sitting on the back step in the evening air
With sea green eyes and her chestnut hair
You keep your mansions of gold, buddy,
I don't care
Cause I know where love lives

You keep all that your fortune brings
All your fancy words, all your precious things
No matter what all your money buys
It's in the arms of love
That true treasure lies

Hal Ketchum,"A threadbare alibi.....a lifetime full of promise
Fell from my Mary's eyes as she saw the screen door swing
The baby never woke......he lay cradled in her trembling
He lay safe and never knowing what my leavin would bring

I draw my pay down on the docks.....I send it off to Mary
I might hold back a dollar to wash this pain out of my back
But the pain keeps getting clearer and Mary your face just keeps on fading
Now the light shines through this bottle....memories all fade to black

Well I'll see you out on the street tonight
I'm a lover of a drink, a lover of a fight
Hold my own on the dark side of this town

I will never fear, for I will never feel

We got what we came for, this is part of the deal
I can't forget you, I can't even try
Sometimes it seems like somebody died

Old soldiers die hard, old hearts beat slow
Old friends go easy, old lovers just go

Some fools never learn, ain't that what they say
I turned for a moment, you turned away
You had your reasons, God only knows
If it bothered you baby, it never showed

Old soldiers die hard, old hearts beat slow
Old friends go easy, old lovers just go
Old soldiers die hard, old heads hang low
Old friends go easy, old lovers just go

I keep telling myself that it's alright
But I know that later on tonight

It's not workin' out like you wanted
I'm not the one to be telling this to

Cause brother when you say she's not all that you dreamed of
I'll say you're dreaming too much
Cause I know she's more than some damn fool deserves
I know she's somebody's love, yes, I know she's somebody's love

Would it hit me like thunder, that's what I'd expect

It was softer than a whisper
Quiet as the moon
But I could hear it loud as laughter

It was gentle as a baby's hand
But it held me like a chain

It showed a line of wagons movin' someplace far away
That picture made my daddy smile, it made my Momma cry
It seems like Daddy's wagon load of dreams had long since passed her by

But the dream that makes the sparrow fly can make an eagle fall
And one that makes the rich man money, it ain't no dream at all
It's a cryin' shame to wake up just to find it's all been broke in two
Careful what you're dreamin', 'cause it someday may come true

Well he talked on all through supper time 'bout the good prospector's life
Couldn't see Momma didn't wanna be no good prospector's wife
He said, ""We best sell out and go before the weather turns too cold
And maybe buy ourselves an extra horse to carry all the gold""

I wonder how long the pride of a man can hold on

Facing the dawn, faster and faster the night slips away
And the road it just rolls on and on, sleeping alone
Waking up to another sad song of another day gone

When I walked away
How could I have known, how far we'd drift apart?
Now the time and the distance I thought would save us
Has stolen my place in your heart

And now you don't need me the way I need you
You found your own way to move on
And the star I've been chasing just fades in the night

She let out a little laugh

Opened up my overcoat

'Cause I saw the light in your eyes

Though we had our fling
I just never would suspect a thing
'Til that little bell began to ring in my head
In my head
But I tried to run,
though I knew it wouldn't help me none
'Cause I couldn't ever love no one, or so I said
But my feelings for you
were just something I never knew

But I love you best

If it wasn't for havin' you,
Don't let go, Don't let go.

Ah shucks, I wouldn't stop for a million bucks.
I love you so, Just hold me tight.
Don't let go!

One day, baby, you'll quit me yet,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
I'll be cryin' and soakin' wet,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
One thing, baby, I'll never stand,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
Your lips kissin' some other man.

Hal Ketchum,"Left this town with a memory and nothin' to my name
But an old guitar and a melody running through my brain
People said, 'You crazy fool, ain't never gonna get that far
Start rollin' down the track, you can't go back""

Kicked around some places, a man should never go
By fortune and the grace of God, I learned to just say no
I wish I had everything I spent but it don't work that way
Keep rollin' down the track, you can't go back

Gone's gone and done is done
Lord knows I ain't the only one
Stopped along the way

Can't go back
Gone's gone and done is done
Lord knows I ain't the only one
Stopped along the way

Thankful for the places and the people I have known
Live by every tender word and every kindness shown
Hopefully I've left a little something in return
Keep rollin' down the track, you can't go back

Hal Ketchum,"I build houses and barns and a birdhouse or two
Studied my blue prints and plans
I like wood that don't argue, nails that drive straight
Tools that don't skin up my hands

I have followed my call from Texas to Maine
Bangin' out churches and chairs
Struttin' the snow and the sun and the rain
Bangin' out rafters and stairs

And I'm slow but I'm steady
I prize the work more than the pay
I'm rough and I'm ready

Livin' the carpenter's way

Tomorrow you'll find me up on some roof
Watchin' the sun play the hill
Rye in my coffee, love in my heart
Doin' what carpenter's will

And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you

I'll tell you no lie

To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?

Hal Schaefer,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere

I know that I'll soon go mad

Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much and just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words

You're much, you're too much and just too very, very

Hal Schaefer,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Hal Sherfey,"Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied

I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind

You were always on my mind",Always on My Mind
Hal Sherfey,"I can recall the sound of the wind
As it blew through the trees and the trees would bend
I can recall the smell of the rain
On a hot summer night
Coming through the screen

I'd crawl in your bed when the lightning flashed
And I'd still be there when the storm had passed
Dead to the world, to the morning cast
Its light all around your room

We lived on a street where the tall elm shade
Was as green as the grass and as cool as a blade
That you held in your teeth as we lay on our backs
Staring up at the blue and the blue stared back

I used to believe we were just like those trees
We'd grown just as tall and as proud as we pleased
With our feet on the ground and our arms in the breeze
Under a sheltering sky

Twirl me about, and twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
And when I look up at you looking down,
Say it was only a dream

A big truck was parked in the drive one day
They wrapped us in paper and moved us away
Your room was no longer next door to mine
And this kid sister thing was old by that time

But oh how our dreams went bump in the night
And the voices downstairs getting into a fight
And the next day a silence you could cut with a knife
And feel like a blade at your throat

Twirl me about and twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
When I look up at you looking down
Say it as only a dream

The day you left home you got an early start
I watched your car back out in the dark
I opened the door to your room down the hall
I turned on the light
And all that I saw
Was a bed and a desk and couple of tacks
No sign of someone who expects to be back
It must have been one hell of a suitcase you packed

Twirl me about, twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
When I look up at you looking down
Say it was only a dream

That means I offer my life to you to be my own
If you refuse me I will be blue, waiting all alone

Hal Singer,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath

I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

Hal Singer,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Hal Singer,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Hal Stein,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends
Hal Stein,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",Medley: You Go to My Head
Hal Stein,"Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely
Heaven must have sent him my way

Skies above me
Never were as blue as his eyes
And he loves me
Who would want a sweeter surprise?

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweeter than the roses in May

Left alone on a cold dark street
It wasn't what you've hoped for

Breakaway from the clouds you see
It's always what's inside

But still you bleed

I'm thinking of what you've done and said
You crumpled my heart
I was down on my knees

Wondered if you still even cared
I've cried all alone
I'm done with all these tears

I'm singing my last song
I'm singing my last song
I'm singing my last song
For you...

I'm healing the wounds
I'm staring at stars across my room
My meaning is lost
I'm bound for defeat

Discover me inside
It's all just a memory left behind
One day I'll fly
So high above my feet

Is the last thing I'm gonna make
And the next in line
Is the one that whose gonna break you

And pretend I'm doing you again

We made magic that night.

Halestorm,"Some like beautiful, perfect and pretty
I see the good in the bad and the ugly
I need the volume one louder than ten
I put the pedal to the metal, needle into the red
If the windows ain't shaking
Making my heart race
If I can't feel it in my chest
I'm in the wrong damn place!

I got a demon in my soul and a voice in my head
It's saying go, go, go! I can sleep when I'm dead
There's a sonic revelation bringing me to my knees
And there's a man down below who needs my sympathy
I got a ringing in my ears getting ready to burst
Screaming ""hallelujah, hallelujah take me to church""

I like it louder than the boom
Of a big bass drum
I need it harder than the sound
Of a guitar grunge
I love to crank it up
Make it thump
And evil to the core
Headbanging in the pit
And throwing my horns
And just like old school
Sabbath, Zeppelin and Lemmy
I need to drop it down low
And make it heavy
I like it heavy, oh ohh
I like it heavy, oh ohh

I ride the lightning, roll with the thunder
I'm going down down down with my sisters and brothers
I fell in love with their darkest parts
Stand on the side of the wild at heart
I plucked the feather off a crow so I could fly
Since I was thirteen years old I've had my fist to the sky

I like it louder than the boom
Of a big bass drum
I need it harder than the sound
Of a guitar grunge
I love to crank it up
Make it thump
And evil to the core
Headbanging in the pit
And throwing my horns

Take me home tonight I, do anything with you
Buy a bottle of whiskey, we'll get matching tattoos
Tell me that you love me, oh let me drive your car
We can sit to morning light, just countin' every stars
'Cause if there's a Hell, I'll meet you there
And if there's a Heaven, they're serving beer
And if you're an angel then, I must be high
Oh if there's a church, it's rock 'n roll
If there's a devil, I sold my soul
And it's alright whatever we do tonight

Scraped up every piece that fell to the floor

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Well, down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

I did just that and gave Hud a stack, shout 'I'll be right back'
In fact, I'ma be over here talkin' to love

Hit so many girls, and spent so many faces

You stopped poppin' Cristal nigga, now you sippin' Louie The Third
Moved to Jers, now it's like you moved from Earth
Shoes and furs
You know how much these jewels is worth?
I'm playin' hardball, you usin' a nerf
Haul the Porsche to the Golf course
My Daddy's a mob boss
My Daddy fell off course
But I'm still well off in the loft
Ill fella, Ladies faint during intercourse
Control a bitch' mind like I invented whores
Mack without a Goldie hat or a Six-Four
I got cash and plan to get more
Of that cream chicks strip for, lick dick for 
Hopin' they can get rich for
Up in the Benz door openin' up the Six door
I had you more open than that when I entered your pores
Had your Tits stiff plus made you strip to your drawers

To the same streets we turned Willie on
Catch me spillin' Dom
I was a Don before Beneton

Three-Sixty waves with the spin on
Quarter-bills with the brim on
Try to slaughter Mils 
I have no choice but to draw the steel
I'm hard, somethin' that every broad 'll feel
Like a climax, this rod 'll get all the way to your back 
I'll have your Wifey fightin' you back
Light on the gat
Send my Son to pick her up, she jumps right in the Ac'
She chose me, you know B., why even ask?
Now have a nice day, 'cause it might be your last
Stay cool like ice in a glass
I made these rules, you might could use a class
Tune in to the Mack
Let me introduce you to the facts on shoes and hats
Jewels and stacks
The rules are flat
I was through with that before you knew what to do with that.

I get my dick soaked in bubbly
So lovely I got your chick tellin' you ""Nigga, don't touch me""
She don't smoke but she roll dutchies
She was a nice girl now she exposed the hole in her butt-cheeks
Ride the pole 'till the nut leaks
I taught her how to swallow my soul and spit up somethin' sweet
And you wonder why she got your jeep
I turned her out in these streets
Now she's ballin' with freaks
Went from Menage's to Tri-Quadre's, ill ho 
Still feel Mill though
Trips on for real yo
I'm the reason why she threw away her dildo
Flew Ki's over Frisco
It glow, baguettes glisten like the crystal in a disco
You a rich ho, on my dick though
Bought a nigga that Six-O
Ten AV's
Cockin' ya Fifth when your bitch page me

Tell lies in Philadelphia
Use my Chocha to get bail for ya"".

And shorty wit diamonds from South African mines
Now it's '99, nearly 2 G, still in coogie
Crib wit Jacuzzi, it is in the movie
I take a shit, grippin the uzi
Plan to make ya rich, smoothly, on the low
Fuck a new V, on the run like cool G.
Marijuana twist, camouflage sis
On some hard shit, charge like a platinum card, kid
Enter the wild life, Crystal life, I'd rather die twice
Before I eat, four chicken wings and fried rice
Yo dunn, we high price, we news of the world
White wine type, I don't like swine type
No bullshit we, strictly chronic to life
Bionic wit mics, seein shit with astronomical sight, tropin night
Laid up, after the fight, live from cocktail Milion

Hot enough to cause fires in hell

See us flossin, you swear to God we rob Tito's

Head twisted, on the red, by vet bitches
Super fly son, movin my gun, born on the run

I be the high explosive, burnin bushes like Howard Moses
Higher dosage, chocolate roasted
Made ya team, without a coach kid, chrome toasted

Five percent of two, biochemical, nine emeralds

You want a key and yay, see a
You ain't got the dough we spray, fuck the D.A.
Truck breeze away, material world
Big guns, wit scratched serial world
My cats put an end to your world

Half-A-Mill,"Verse 1:
I used to watch you in the schoolyard while you jump rope
baretts in your hair, fresh gear, your Brothers pump dope
I approached you but no others could come close, I used to buy you
slices of Pizza and Strawberry iceys
gentleman style, always talkin' very nicely
everytime we played House I'd be the Husband you the Wifey
Mom dukes whoopin' your ass because you liked me
walkin' down the block switchin' ya ass tryin' to excite me 
I still have those letters that you used to write me
about how since we met up you see the future brightly
young love, smooth and politely
untouched 
my one touch had you sprung up 
on the phone for hours
I told you before we hung up, ""Young stuff, this World is ours"" 
together Girl we can make a better World
my ghetto Girl....

You're my ghetto girl in a ghetto World 
for you I'd dead the World
I'll never forget my ghetto girl

you're a ghetto girl in a ghetto World
for you I'd dead the World
I'll never forget my ghetto girl 

Verse 2:
I still spend days reminiscin' 
age changed, different livin' 
cables and chains, waves spinnin' 
had you in the projects, the Gods knowledged you as my Wisdom 
always around tryin' to lock me down like Prison
I saw your vision 
always wishin' for the day we'd have kids'n
wedding and a Cristening 
baguettes around your wrist'n 
chicks used to say to you always ""Why you stick with him?""
""Every conversation we have you always mention him""
in all actuality they just mad 'cause I ain't get with them 
and all the Men they ever had seemed to split on them 
but I ain't gonna do you like those Cats did to them 
hustlin' cracks, bustin' the MAC so nice clothes can cover your back
you lovin' me and I'm lovin' you back 
rubbin' your back
can't nobody tell you other than that.

Verse 3: 
Out of this World
no more Guess, you're a Gibana girl
givin' me Sex, you were a ""I guess I'll try it"" girl
still into baguettes, Tennis set type of World
Black Queen Nefertiti in the flesh in my World
in the best of my World
you're obsessed with my World
I'd tell you how much I was blessed since you stepped in my World
I loved to caress you and express to you 
I only want what's best for you 
sexin' you in unforgettable ways, I treasure you
pleasure you to an extent that's imeasureable

You know my style dunn, I run with foul wild men
With public housin, up north, we be thuggin in the mountain
Out in the world, we guzzle Henny straight and no earl
Hustle weight, stab a half a cake on your girl, skatin through states
Jets raidin the place, TV's screen big, DVD playin Scarface

Smash you in the chest wit a sledgehammer till ya heart break
Wild out, my calico pop rounds out, my shots knock towns out
My whole block'll run up in your town house

Half-Handed Cloud,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Thumb/Toe Collection

Halford,"From memories of 68 when the wizard shook the world
Metal came from foundries where the midlands sound unfurled
The bullring was a lonely place of concrete towers and steel
The coal mines and the industries were all I had to fell.

Something inside took hold of me, I really didn't know
But overtime it came to be, I knew which way to go
I drove around in search of what would make this all come true
From jazz and electricity and good old southern blues

Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell

In Henry's and in mother's where I'd go to bang my head
The feeling took a hold of me with every word I said
The voice was born and came alive from all I saw and heard
And now I knew my destiny, I had to spread the word.

I took the scream around the world
From London to L.A.
Unleashed in downtown Tokyo
Blew Godzilla away

Then on the sound and fury went from Sydney to Brazil
It sent the Russians crazy cause they never get their fill.

Of Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell
Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell

The stage and the lights and the amps are ablaze watch them burn
From all this insanity the Metal God's will return.

Shock waves attack relentlessly, intimidating force
So many bands surrounding you with evil from our source
It screams across the universe and slams you to the floor
This blitzkrieg psycho mania is coming on full roar
The world's a stage that's waiting for its bad ass to get kicked
And we're all on the road to hell and that's route 666

Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell
Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell",Made in Hell

It reaches deep within, it's pulling me apart

Night Fall, you take my soul
Night Fall, you're in control

Your love's still haunting me, it draws me into black
Your veil of fantasy, won't let my soul come back
The spell has taken all, I can't release my mind
I've lost my heart to you, you're too cruel to be kind.

To bring myself out of this God-damned hole

And found the truth was with me from the start

Holy angel lift me from this burning hell 
Resurrection make me whole
Son of Judas bring the saints to my revenge 
Resurrection bring me home

I walked alone into a Fight
No longer standing in satanic light

Needle in my heart,
Needle in my heart,

Take a breath and fill my troubled
Soul with all mankind.

I am God, I am fate, I am all the sins you make, yeah - hate.
I am black, I am white, I am the blood upon the knife, yeah - hate.

Since time began I made a vow to drag you underground;
To steal your soul of purity and watch you waste away.

I am pure, I am right, I'm the God that makes you fight, yeah - hate.
I am life, I am death, I will steal your final breath, yeah - hate.

I prey upon your broken dreams your weakness gives me strength.
I'm laughing at your silent screams I'll crush you with my hate.

You take it all
And face the fear that's here
Until the Silence Screams
it leaves you with no choice to carry on.

You'll never fall
When all is said and done

You spineless things that belly down to slither
To the end of the world you follow to be near

Mourn for us oppressed in fear
Chained and shackled we are bound
Freedom choked in dread we live

Withdraw your feeble aches and moans
Or suffer smite from this my hand

I can wait
When you stumble
Seal your fate

Empty threats
Fucked up lies
Take you down
With alibis

Useless strength
Wastes on me
Crush you down
Dead enemy

Halford,"From memories of '68 when The Wizard shook the world,
Metal came from foundries where the midlands sound unfurled.
The Bull Ring was a lonely place of concrete towers and steel,
The coal mines and the industries were all I had to feel.
Something inside took hold of me, I really didn't know,
But over time it came to be, I knew which way to go.
I drove around in search of what would make this all come true,
Some jazz and electricity and good old southern blues

Hell, we're born to raise some hell.
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell.

In Henry's and in Mother's where I'd go to bang my head
The feeling took a hold of me with every word I said.
The voice was born and came alive from all I saw and heard
And now I knew my destiny, I had to spread the word.
I took the scream around the world from London to L.A.
Unleashed in downtown Tokyo, blew Godzilla away.
Then on the sound and fury went from Sydney to Brazil
It sent the Russians crazy 'cause they never get their fill.

Of Hell, we're born to raise some hell,
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell.
Hell, we're born to raise some hell,
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell.

The stage and the lights and the amps are ablaze, watch them burn.
From all this insanity the Metal Gods will return.

Shock waves attack relentlessly, intimidating force
So many bands surrounding you with evil from our source
It screams across the universe and slams you to the floor
This blitzkrieg psycho-mania is coming on full roar
The world's a stage that's waiting for its bad ass to get kicked
And we're all on the road to Hell and that's route 666

He packed his bags and headed south across the Rio Grande
The town was mean and brutal for a gringo filled with strife
He was about to end it all when some thing changed his life

A bullfight in the street went bad the beast made to escape
And in a feat of danger with his jacket as a cape
He stared into the eyes of death and bought it to his knees
A cry went up from in the crowd at last he felt appeased

Then all the people were screaming
Having the time of their lives
Some said they thought they were dreaming
But he was right there before their eyes

Suit of life never to save

The Greatest of the Greats they said
One never to be missed
But all good things come to an end
And so it was with his

A moments hesitation and he felt the gore go deep
His life flashed in slow motion as the crowd begin to weep
The country was in mourning as they buried him that day
But memories live for ever like the ghost of him they say

No one can stand in his foot steps
Or follow him by a mile

Control was part of the fever
Together with such restraint

Cheating death plunging the sword

With respect praise for the bull

There was a sense of dramatic
That in the blink of an eye
It could turn into traumatic
Would he be alive or die

And master of his domain

And we wouldn't have it any other way
So let them make their move

When you got something that's as strong as this
Don't matter if you fall
You get back up and face another day
Ready to make that call

Nothing in life is easy
Nothing in life is free

[Chorus]
I'm the thunder to your lightning
Can you feel it?
What we got is so exciting
It's a love they can't deny

Now me and you we got a simple heart
We don't need that much to make it run
Our souls are living proof right from the start
You got to get your knees dirty one by one

So when you look at me I wanna cry
This is good as all I ever need
Cause I'll be with ya till the day I die
Something that we both believe

Nothing in life is easy
Nothing in life is free

[Chorus]

They can't take it, they can leave it
We don't care cause
This will always be our secret
For the rest of our lives

Nothing can bring us down
We'll always be around
Nothing can stop us now

I ain't a dreamer, I know what's real
And you are just the same as me
So if the cards of life can't break the deal
Then what is there left to see

Roll out the freedom bell and cross your heart
Cause me and you we love to sing
And they don't like it they can go to hell
So come on baby make it ring

Nothing in life is easy
Nothing in life is free

They can't take it, they can leave it
We don't care cause
This will always be our secret
For the rest of our lives",Thunder and Lightning
Halford,"I ain't got no time for forgiven
I ain't got no time be afraid
I ain't got no time to be slowing me down

I got no time for the foolish man
When the world treats him so bad

Oh, I always know I'm living 'til the day I die, yeah!

They say there's light in the tunnel
They say there's a name in the book
But I don't care for the rumor mill
That hangs you on a hook

Soon I'll be meeting my Maker
Then I'll deceased and desist
I'll leave my name in the air somewhere
Where I can get some peace
Where I can get some peace

Halford,"I can't remember
When the moment started
It creeps up
When you least expect to fail
You try to tell yourself
That you are selfless
But that's the big mistake
That sets your sail

The signs are all around you
But you miss them
You turn your back
On every friend you know
The games you play
To justify your madness
Will leave you crying
For the pain that grows

[Chorus]
Twenty-five years, twenty-five years
I tried to be a man and face my fears
Twenty-five years, twenty-five years
I've had the devil on my back for twenty five years

For when you fall
You have to reach the bottom
And count your blessings
That you're still alive

That's when you look
To someone who was with you
At every single step
Right by your side

It's said from this you grow
Inside much stronger
That may be true
But I am still so weak

There's days that seem
So endless makes me wonder
Will something come
To close this losing streak

[Chorus]

I'm tired and so lonely
From this journey
And still can't figure out
Some things I've said

But all I know
Is there's a place that's calling
I'll find that place
And rest my weary head

Twenty-five years
Twenty-five years
I tried to be a man
And face my fears

Turns jaws into glass

Opponents line up as they meet him
And watch as they fall one by one

He's the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world
Taking the prize to dismiss and demise

Pugnacious and firm
Combative by rule

So pity the fool

Don't step in the ring, or it's owner
Enables that justice prevails
It's hard to give in and then own up

Can't tear this love apart

If we don't leap for faith
How can we be free
We can't deny or say goodbye

Halford,"Well I'll be damned 
Here comes your ghost again 
But that's not unusual 
It's just that the moon is full 
And you happened to call 
And here I sit 
Hand on the telephone 
Hearing a voice I'd known 
A couple of light years ago 
Heading straight for a fall

As I remember your eyes 
Were bluer than robin's eggs 
My poetry was lousy you said 
Where are you calling from? 
A booth in the midwest 
Ten years ago 
I bought you some cufflinks 
You brought me something 
We both know what memories can bring 
They bring diamonds and rust

Well you burst on the scene 
Already a legend 
The unwashed phenomenon 
The original vagabond 
You strayed into my arms 
And there you stayed 
Temporarily lost at sea 
The Madonna was yours for free 
Yes the girl on the half-shell 
Could keep you unharmed

Now I see you standing 
With brown leaves falling all around 
And snow in your hair 
Now you're smiling out the window 
Of that crummy hotel 
Over Washington Square 
Our breath comes out white clouds 
Mingles and hangs in the air 
Speaking strictly for me 
We both could have died then and there

Now you're telling me 
You're not nostalgic 
Then give me another word for it 
You who are so good with words 
And at keeping things vague 
'Cause I need some of that vagueness now 
It's all come back too clearly 
Yes I loved you dearly 
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust 
I've already paid",Diamonds and Rust

Can winter lovers justify

And I've never felt so sure

Yet seek that which is within for the everyday fight in the horrorshow
Sword on your hip, cry on your lip charge upon beasts of your script
Misaligned verse I'm first to admit but life's stage knows no delay

Death the ultimate reality death the ultimate reason to live
No time no cordiality you've got to live because...
Nobody lives, lives forever I try not to slip on my sweat
Nobody lives, lives forever nobody lasts that long
I know when I reach my life's sum the addition will probably be wrong
That's okay I've made my mark pissed in public at least in the dark
When pissing in public one remembers traditions are passed on down the line
As a chamber pot is passed to your neighbor it's level grows higher every time

Do you remember the times that you thrashed do you remember it was suicide
Like healing leeches we drew blood to exorcise your inhibitions
You'll reach the figure down the line who gives you the final wink
Now the pages seem to rhyme as you forgive and wash in his sink
I don't know if that is it or if we choose our sides
But heads have drowned in oceans of fear when there were only peaceful tides",Nobody Lives Forever
Hallows Eve,"Death is drawing closer I'm fighting for my life
I know not how to stop it live through this pain and strife
Awakened in the nighttime I'm fighting for my life
Death is drawing nearer I'll soon be cold as ice
No longer do I trifle bones growing too old
Death longing to reach and grasp my unrelenting soul
When I'm lying at my rest they'll look upon my face
Cry their tears of dreadful mourn in their weakened daily pace

Remember me, hear my plea time's drawing nigh for me to die
Remember me, hear my plea take from this heart the bitter part
The world they will destroy me or put me in the ground
Stand around my grave site with their heads all hanging down
When I'm lying at my rest they'll look upon my face
Cry their tears of dreadful mourn in their weakened daily pace
Staring at the ceiling the tubes glow in the dark
Fearless thoughts invade my head to tear my mind apart
Trapped within this feeling I feel it deep inside
Knock of death upon my door and I've no will to hide

Take from me my very soul with wretched mourning death
Take mine eyes for I have seen the hell in which we live
Take now from one man on earth who loved this life so much
Take away everything for it's all cold to the touch
Remember me, hear my plea soon the darkness I will see
Remember me, hear my plea for now another...",Plea of the Aged
Hallows Eve,"This era, this music, this scene
Our great monument to nothing
This glory, this sweat, this play
Makes no difference what we say

For every man stands a ghost
For every ghost stands a star
For every star stands a thought
And these accumulate somewhere

If God is the personification
Of the total of man's thought
Then I must be the reflection
Of all you have fought

This era, this music, this scene
Our great monument to nothing
This glory, this sweat, this play
Makes no difference what we say

Look into a place that you dare not look
You'll find me staring back at you
A perfect reflection, your mirror

We're together, me and you

Hallucinogen,"'I believe with the advent of acid. We discovered new ways to think and it has to do with piecing together new thoughts of mind. Why is it that people are so afraid of it? What is it about it that scares people so deeply? Because they are afraid that there is more to reality than they have ever confronted. That there are doors that they are afraid to go in and they don't want us to go in there either because if we go in, there we might learn something that they don't know. And that makes us a little out of their control.'",L.S.D.
Hallucinogen,"'There is an area of the mind that could be called unsane
beyond sanity, and yet not insane.

close to insanity, but not insanity, is unsanity",Demention

We will walk away from empty gold

Dark as midnight sun
Smoke as black as charcoal
Fills into our fragile lungs
'Cause when our demons come
Dancing in the shadows
To a game that can't be won

Feel like we've been falling down 
Like these autumn leaves
But baby don't let winter come 
Don't let our hearts freeze

If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold

We're the underdogs, in this world alone
I'm a believer, got a fever running through my bones
We're the alley cats and they can throw their stones
They can break our hearts, they won't take our souls

Where a boy lives behind bricks,
He's got an eye for girls of eighteen,

I let him climb inside my body
And held him captive in my kiss

Flashing those eyes like highway signs
Light one up and hand it over, rest your head upon my shoulder
I just wanna feel your lips against my skin

You told me this is right where it begins
But your lips hang heavy underneath me
And I promised myself I wouldn't let you complete me

I'm trying not to let it show, that I don't want to let this go
Is there somewhere you can meet me?
'Cause I clutched your arms like stairway railings
And you clutched my brain and eased my ailing

You're writing lines about me; romantic poetry
Your girl's got red in her cheeks, 'cause we're something she can't see
And I try to refrain but you're stuck in my brain
And all I do is cry and complain because second's not the same

When his hair falls in his face
And his hands so cold they shake

I found the Devil
I found him in a lover
And his lips like tangerine
In his color coded speak

In a hotel room where demons play
They run around beneath our feet
We roll around beneath these sheets

He told me that I'd never
With his educated eyes
And his head between my thighs

I found a savior
I don't think he remembers
'Cause he's off to pay his crimes
And he's got no time for mine

Vile romance, turned dreams into an empire
Self made success now she woes with Rockefellers

He looks just like his father
But he could never love somebody's daughter

So he vowed to be his husband at the alter

Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parents' strife
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love
And the continuance of their parents' rage
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage
The which if you with patient ears attend
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend

Als mich dieser Lichtstrahl traf
Hielt sie im Arm fast engelsgleich
Wie einst ein König der sich seiner Magd unterwarf

Sie war so rein und voller Zier
Hielt fest die Unschuld in der Hand
Bis wir die ersten Schritte wagten
In ein fremdes Land

Die Engel sprechen ein Gedicht
Alte Liebe rostet nicht
Die Sonne zeigt mir ihr Gesicht
Alte Liebe rostet nicht

Tiefe Narben langsam heilen
Gedanken noch sehr lang verweilen
Bis der Frühling lachend spricht
Alte liebe rostet nicht!

Als der Docht der achten Kerze
Wie ein Baum im Sturm zerbrach
Erlosch im Haus die letzte Glut
Legte sich Asche wie ein grauer Schleier übers Dach

Seitdem probierte ich genügend
Verbotene Früchte laut und still
Doch was nützen tausend Messer
Wenn man eine Gabel will

Ungeachtet der Gezeiten
Die hart am Denkmal nagen
Werden Herzen auch nach Jahren
Mühelos im Gleichschritt schlagen

Die Engel sprechen ein Gedicht
Alte Liebe rostet nicht
Die Sonne zeigt mir ihr Gesicht
Alte Liebe rostet nicht

Tiefe Narben langsam heilen
Gedanken noch sehr lang verweilen
Bis der Frühling lachend spricht
Alte liebe rostet nicht!

Zwei Seelen schlagen in der Brust
Eine Liebe andere Frust
Und will ich einmal glücklich werden
Muss eine von den Beiden sterben

Hamell on Trial,"I see you on the cover of Rolling Stone, or one of those other corny music magazines, 
That's just an excuse to sell fashion or bullshit, but occasionally sticks in a good writer
Or political story so at the 
Board meeting they can ease their conscience that the majority of their readership 
Has the IQ of well a Creed fan. 

So you pucker your mouth and you show lots of thigh, coy celebrity sexy, teasing cleavage. 
Ass in the air, selling your product, down on your knees, why so shy? 
'Cause you stand for nothing really, you got nothing to say, it's insulting your pretense 
Of integrity. Take the movie's name, tattoo it on your labia, spread your legs for the camera, 
What difference would it make? 

I mean fuck it,why go halfway? 
I mean fuck it, why go halfway? 

So you think you might be Jesus, let's be frank, 
You're the lead singer of a big rock band. 

Let's get the bass player to nail you to a cross, 
Long rusty spikes, right through your hands. 

(repeat chorus) 

You're a world leader with your finger on the button, 
Thinking that history is smiling on you. 

Blow the shit out of everybody that doesn't agree. 
Do it in the name of patriotism, what else should you do? 

(repeat chorus) 

I'm a self-righteous prick, with a great mouth, 
But I'm sick to death of mediocrity and lies. 

And I'm preaching to the choir, and I'm yelling down a hole, I used to sing between the lines but then I got wise.

Hamilton Camp,"Turn around,
Go back down,
Back the way you came,
Can't you see that flash of fire ten times brighter than the day?

And behold a mighty city broken in the dust again,
Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again.
Turn around,
Go back down,

Back the way you came,
Babylon is laid to waste, Egypt's buried in her shame,
The mighty men are all beaten down, their kings are fallen in the ways,
Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again.

Turn around,
Go back down,
Back the way you came,
Terror is on every side, lo our leaders are dismayed.

For theose who place their faith in fire, their faith in fire shall be
Repayed,
Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again.
Turn around,

Go back down,
Back the way you came,
And shout a warning unto the nation that the sword of God is raised.
Yes, Babylon, that mighty city, rich in treasures, wide in fame,

Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again.
The meek shall cause your tower to fall, make a new pyre of flame,
Oh you who dwell on many waters, rich in treasures, wide in fame.
You bow unto your God of gold, your pride of might shall be a shame,

For only God can lead His people back unto the Earth again.
Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again.
A Holy mountain be restored, and mercy on that people, that people...",Pride of Man

"Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds","When you're down and troubled

And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me

I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

Her sunny smile is my only light
To love her now is the sole thing that I'm after
I'll make her melody my life
She came to me when I knew I'd lost the meaning
Lifted the shadow from across my way
She touched my heart with the sweet song she was singing
Brought back the sun into my days

Ooooh she is my lady
I'm a witness to the wonder of her ways
Oooh she's my lady
The solitary reason for my days

And sometimes when my burdens just seem too overbearing
The girl turns my tears with a single sigh
She taught me loving
And through love we both learned sharing
Right now she's every, every reason why

Ooooh she is my lady
I'm a witness to the wonder of her ways
Ooooh she's my lady

Porque no te necesito, porque quiero que te quede claro.

¿Quién eres tu?, yo no lo se

Olvida que existo, es mucho mejor
Ya no me motiva estar así
Cuando nada me hare daño, cuando no se que decir
Ha ocurrido siempre why pasará
Que no importa lo que eres sino lo que serás
Voy a asegurarme why no gastar
Ni un solo minuto en tener que decir más

...en tener que decir más (4x)

si vienes de frente o si vienes de atrás

Solo que ahora soy yo why nadie más que yo

escuchado why, por supuesto, visto.

que te acuerdas, fuimos un buen anfitrión why tus nos recibiste
como todo un cabrón, puteando ignorando why con el mazo
dando, donde mas duele cabrón, en eso que pregonas why,
que dice algo así como ""todos hermanos cogidos de la mano""
no me creo el sermón, me importa una mierda toda tu posición
why hasta aquí hemos llegado, quiero que quede muy claro
cansados de aguantar, frustrados pero armados.

De ilusión, puedes estar seguro,
también, conservo mi orgullo.
Existir, creer en mí fue la única manera de sobrevivir.
¿Y a quien más?, debo pedir permiso
para hablar, sin molestar, sin tapujos al nombrar
a cada cosa como se la debe de llamar.

With you I lived among the kings, how could this ever die

Future full of hope, nothing could stand in our way
But dreams can change, visions fall, I feel so lonely
I would walk through fire for just one more day

Now I'm a stranger in your eyes, walls are closing in on me

But after darkness comes the light
And when I turn to the west, the silent night hides all
Where is the light that shines so bright

I been there - been there
Done that - done that
You got guns? - we got guns...
Yo, I got straps - we got straps...
A million muthafuckas on the planet Earth talk that hard
Bullshit - 'cause it's all they worth...
No question, it's all about the D - O - E
So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree
Ain't tryin' to stock around for the Illuminati
Got to buy my own island by the year 2 G...
Since way back I've been collecting my fee
With the 48-tracks and the M - I - C
Got a palace in the Hills overlooking the sea
It's worth eight, but I only paid five point three
Worldwide, got the triple beam, I slide
Listenin' to yo demo in a stretch limo
It's how I ride - cartel style
Full, stacked to the max now
A million-dollar smile, people wonder how
'Dre Day' every day. Trips to Montiego Bay
With more chips than Frito Lay
Flossed jewels in a tire, ain't nuthin' fly
Straight or illegal - it's still the root of all evil...
Coz...

[Chorus] 

Young black Rockerfeller. Hell, a swiss and mozarella
Pockets sweller, gettin' money like a bank teller
'Cause a fool and his dough soon split
So when you come across a fool get all that she be gettin'
Ladies, get your paper too
Don't expect for no man to support you
Keep it true
'Cause most brothers are raised to decide for the pesos
My woman is independent, makin' dough by the case loads
I'ma keep buildin'... make it killing
Kick back, relax, and grow old with my millions
That's where it's at. You got drama, I got the gat
But we're both black so I don't want to lay you flat
Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get
Private Jet, 600 coupes that I runs if...
I'm livin' on another level that why'all ain't been yet
Spend a mill, no sweat, water the line with my wet...

[Chorus:]  

This is for the millionaires
Throw a stack in the air and watch brothers start plottin'
Honeys start to stare
'Cause game is money and money is game
And broke brothers make the forty five flame with no shame
Now many people die over these dead green guys
Ignorance and greed take their ass by surprise
It's the root of all evil and sins
Yet and still it makes the world go around
Like my twenty-inch rims...
Moolah why'all
Platinum plaques cover my walls
Grindin', diamonds shinin', and without one flaw
Get the cash, the grass, the ass will bounce
Luciano and all amounts, that's all that counts 'cause...

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Hampton Hawes,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",My Man
Hampton Hawes,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon
Hampton Hawes,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Hampton Hawes,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile
Hampton Hawes,"We have been gay, going our way
Life has been beautiful, we have been young
After you've gone, life will go on
Like an old song we have sung

When I grow too old to dream
I'll have you to remember
When I grow too old to dream
Your love will live in my heart
So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part

And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart

So, kiss me my sweet
And so let us part
And when I grow too old to dream
That kiss will live in my heart",When I Grow Too Old to Dream
Hampton Hawes,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April [#]

Hampton Hawes,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.

Hampton Hawes,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Hampton Hawes,"I don't want you, but I'd hate to lose you

[Repeat: x2]
I ought to cross you off my list
But when you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more

The lights are turned way down low

How I'll hate going out in the storm!

Worth more than my love and affection?
But this time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms

(think it over) haven't I been sweet to you?

Pulled my trigger, now he's dead

Han Bennink,"Young and foolish
Why is it wrong to be
Young and foolish
We haven't long to be

Soon enough the carefree days
The sunlit days go by
Soon enough the bluebird has to fly

We were foolish
One day we fell in love
Now we wonder
What were we dreaming of

Smiling in the sunlight
Laughing in the rain
I wish that we were
Young and foolish again

Smiling in the sunlight
Laughing in the rain
I wish that we were
Young and foolish again",Young and Foolish
Hana Hegerová,"Lásko prokletá, za pár slov a vět
Vezmu kletbu zpět
Pamatuj, že ta kletba 
Byla jen marná obrana
Píseň ohraná, vykotlaný kmen
Roztočí se zas naše ruleta 
Počkej do léta, to je její čas
Lásko prokletá, lásko prokletá
Lásko prokletá, lásko prokletá

Teď, když napad sníh, když je venku mráz
My jsme v závějích, závěje jsou v nás
Dřív než začne tát, slib, že zůstaneš
Že zůstaneš rád, I když je to lež
U mě najdeš skrýš, nemusíš se bát
A než začne tát, všechno pochopíš
Lásko prokletá, lásko prokletá, lásko prokletá, lásko prokletá

Lásko prokletá, jenom klidně lež, ptej se na co chceš
Je to odveta za minulý čas
Jen se rozpomeň dobře na oheň, který náhle zhas
Je tu řídký vzduch
Naše planeta právě oblétá svůj kritický kruh
Lásko prokletá, lásko prokletá, lásko prokletá, lásko prokletá

Jen to zkus a vstaň! Klesneš na polštář
A dáš si mou dlaň na svou horkou tvář
Jen to zkus a běž! Já tě nepustím 
Proto klidně lež a spokoj se s tím
Že v mém obětí zase budeš spát
Už začíná tát
Řekni jak je ti? 
Lásko prokletá, lásko prokletá, lásko prokletá, lásko lásko

Lásko prokletá, beru kletbu zpět
Roztál celý svět
Jíva rozkvétá
Všechno je teď blíž, skoro na dosah 
A přesto mám strach
Z čeho, to ty víš
Že rok přeletí, přijde sníh a mráz a mně zbyde zas jen to prokletí 
Lásko prokletá, lásko prokletá, lásko prokletá",Lásko Prokletá [NE Me Quitte Pas]

Hands Like Houses,"Father, we fled your house of grey.
We ran from home to seek a place where our bodies would never grow.
Dreamer, child, be cautious of this world!
She has an appetite for boys and girls and she’s hungry for your soul.

Little boys with dreams of paper planes were never meant to scrape the sky!
Keep your feet on the ground kid, only birds were meant to fly.
Keep your head from the clouds kid, keep your wings,
Always keep them by your side.

Before you fly, you’ll fall,
Before you walk, you’ll crawl….

You’ve no need to stitch your shadow to your heels,
No, not this time.

Son you’ll walk with no whisper, no sound,
Only the feet of the heavy hearted are held to the ground.
You’ve no need to draw the curtains son, throw them wide.
Cross the borders between the never and the night.
Find the twinkle in your smile, chase it on ‘til morning,
Past the second star to the right.

We’ll be the smoke curling on the still.
The airship captains; we wait for sun to brush the hills.

Son, I share your windward dreams,
To soar from this little town of shacked up windows and swinging doors!
The rafters creak and the floorboards groan
While the shadows dance to the tapping of my toes.

There’s nothing left for us but altitude,
We’ll be the kings of the air.

Stolen, by the wind that turns the leaves to razors.
Holding just a string, our twine and our paper lost to the breeze.",Antarctica
Hands Like Houses,"We get in our own way,
Tripping on our feet.
Filling up our heads too much
with words too hard to speak.
Drowning in a place
where the night cannot escape.
Commit ourselves into the depths
exposed against the page.

Caught in a phrase,
An echo in our minds,
A flash, A fire,
And its burned into our eyes.

And I cant explain enough,
And I wont let it last the night,
I'll show you that the image is still there unseen.
Its our guess before the line,
If we shine our lights to see,
The things that we have processed on the lines between.

Between the black and white,
Everything goes grey,
And everything's unsaid, undone,
And negative bleeds away
To reveal the memory
That we waited for so long
For the image shifts as the acid drips from to paper, to the floor.

Caught in a phrase,
An echo in our minds,
A flash, A fire,
And its burned into our eyes.

And I cant explain enough,
And I wont let it last the night,
I'll show you that the image is still there unseen.
Its our guess before the line,
If we shine our lights to see,
The things that we have processed on the lines between.

We're so nervous to see
if we've let too much in,
If we, If we were out of focus or out of frame.
I know its a moment of truth
and for recollection,
Reflect reality, Or if its lost forever.

And I cant explain enough,
And I wont let it last the night,
I'll show you that the image is still there unseen.

Hands Like Houses,"It starts with a spark, a breath and a moment of still,
A flicker, a glow, as the oxygen spills through a
Delta of spindles and stone,
Kindled from nothing in a whisper of smoke.

There a gift ignites, a cursive though takes flight,
And there's a dancer, twisting in between the spines.
Give her the breather's kiss, and watch her spirit lift,
She'll take over the stage, and take over the night.

Learning how to make a name from the words we can't keep in.
Learning how to strike a flame, and draw fire from nothing.

I don't know where to begin, to make the words take shape,
How to nurture a flame, and raise it to a blaze
That on the clearest night can be seen forever.
I don't know where to begin, or begin again.

It's not enough, because outside the night is still cold.
The fog is collected on the sill.
Feed the house to the fire to let out the light,
Consumed and inspired, burned magnesium white.

It spills from the hearth.
Take the curtains, the carpet to fuel the insatiable fire inside.
We'll set fire to a hill,
So intense that it will be the brightest star on this side of the sky.

Learning how to make a name from the words we can't keep in.
Learning how to strike a flame, and draw fire from nothing.

I don't know where to begin, to make the words take shape,
How to nurture a flame, and raise it to a blaze

Hands Like Houses,"Here I am. The hammer strikes one, two, three.
I'm impatiently tapping my feet
In a murmuring room full of critics and fakers,
All waiting to take their seat.

The focus of the room, all bating breath,
Waiting on a single word
That could spill from my mouth, that would give them a reason
To take me for all I'm worth.

I took the oath to tell the truth,
So freely I'll tell you this.
My path's my own and mine alone.

You won't understand. You want what I am,
Forgetting the man inside.
I'm calling you out, so try take me down.

And I made it, I made it my own,
But not for you to turn into your personal property.

And what I can achieve, but I won't be waiting.

I don't use your lungs to breathe, your feet can't walk for me.
So tell me where you take your right to my mind.
Brought the sky down on our heads, never mine to claim, you said.
So tell me where you take your right to my freedom,
My cause for creation, my mind, my direction, my life?

Unlock and engage.
When everyone's equal but no-one's the same.
We give what we choose,
But we give what we want to, and not to be used.

I'm the one who pulled it out from under you.
I'm the one who wears the consequence.
I'm the one who will stay true to myself,
So I'll wish you all well,

Of planted possibility.

Between two worlds, each one higher than the last.

But in abandon, lost my grip, and shattered, chose the ground

In unkept chaos, as bare as birth,
A garden, grey, of tangled earth.

The branches pushing me apart where weakness showed,

Dusted off the winter's curse, and she cut me through like knives.

And showed me that I was alive all along.

Authentically raw wit it, see I augmented this industry
To submit to my will, all attempts to limit me
Can kneel, peel caps wit ill raps
Nothing convenes here till your camp gets smeared like pap
What you tryin to tell me, skills never found me
Workin for peanuts amongst jelly MC's, really ain't my steez
Peep game
I plot on different ways to make these styles ricochet through main frames
The day-to-day theme is turn these fake teams gangreen
My main vein's the only thing about me mainstream
You doubt me like the foes of Noah, embarkin in this Ark, the soul controller
While fools caught up in this Del used to blow up
You're inundating wit the out-dated
See all of why'all fall when this cascade hits
Yo D, watch these watered-down clowns get drowned
And lounge sound broken down in Cuba
Tryin to build ships off shit they bit
I spit that major play saliva, taylor-made for cypher sole survivor
Pay the piper if you plan to go inside my covenant
Better come in two's, matta fact come a crew to get you back
Executives, we wet you wit the hymns that leave you and your man
Packin, attackin wit verbal cataclysms
Leavin the average rapper drenched and grab a trench 
Guard against my El Nino lingo
A labyrinth of keen flows, concealed within the single

I flip commission doctrines that make me Shake-Speare's pier
Upon this here tear I fear not
Killin furious wit the superior onslaught
On top of this isle solo, like Giligan wit a million styles
To throw yo' way wit capital A
We make waves, causin tsunamis to your armies
Splashin like the cracken on Clash of the Titans, writin calmly
Call me Aquarius, each full page a new age
I'm on a crusade to ranter your parade 
See 'Core is more than three-quarters of what this rap world secure
So this is Chinese Water Torture for MC's to endure
As I restore this reservoir wit my repetoire of metaphors
Step into the 'Core, better have your life insured
For supernatural disasters, I'm quick to cast a flame to your astral plane
It's bitch-made, get played like Conasta

What's an MC without concepts, I speak easy comin to offset your plumbing
Like leaky faucets, runnin my dungeon wit aquatic contraptions
The fifth fold's a fish bowl, kick hard as contractions
Wit skitzo-memos closed-captioned
Your lip's sewed 'cause hardest to your fraction try to test me
You wouldn't tip-toe through Moses parted Red Sea
It's bound to collapse
So now what makes you think the sound of these raps
Is something different, I'm even pitchin the kitchen sink wit comin with it
Liquefied rhymes rhyme wax
It's time for jack-fakers to vacate, they take up space like the Great Lakes
Makin a great case for me to hate
Paint a picture clear as Evian, raps on tap like Savion Glover
Undercover, peeps wonder, why he became the arcitecht 'cause none love us
We spark the shit that makes the blood cometh
Wash away your blockade plus your brigade
Tryin to sandbag clever words together 
The weather, the storm, porn's poured on cassette wit Architecht sweat
In the cores of us form when he pass Tech-12's
I delve deep in this abyss, inspect hell
Tell a fallen ang-el to eat a dick if he gets pissed 'cause this is Waterworld

(Mr. Gzus)
It's a thrill to me that you niggas want to kill me
I think you all know this saga
They mad cause they wish they had the shit that I had
I'm fucking there babies moma
My soldiers salute with their guns high
Aim and they'll shoot you with one try
I never understood why, niggas snitch and bitches lie
How a motherfucker gonna testify
When he's doing the same shit that I'm doing?
Yap to the feds for a little bit of bread
Now The whole fucking game is ruined
A lot of these niggas are two faced
They need to use glue for they tooth paste
They better strap up or get their boots laced
Or get victim of a 44 shell case
Your bitch said she like the way my dick taste
Now the hoe back up in your face
To the rules of the game you're a disgrace
Never trust no bitch in the first place
Me and Big Sco came to blast these hoes'
Who can't keep shit on the hush
When we come, guns bust
Ruckus hit the dust, it's only us

Chorus:

(Big Sco)
These niggas want drama?
Who the fuck these busta testing
Bout to teach em a lesson, when I get to blesson

No question let me make one suggestion
Don't fuck around with a nigga that you can't fuck with
Cause I buck quick what's wrong dog?
You mad at me cause your bitch suck dick
Just duck quick cause when I let that thing off
When I break it off ring it off it's over with
Busting nuts I'm all over the shoulder shit
You can't fuck with a nigga y'all know this shit is on
Some popo shit but when it comes to me I don't know no shit
You got to go bitch gotta find a big ditch for a bitch snitch
Hit the nigga with 6 in the mix
Ima fix the mother fucker cause he a big bitch
Swiftly hit the nigga with the fifty caliber
Challenger, I'm a damage ya, you a amateur

Fuck around I'll have to handle ya, dismantle ya, ha

Well put it like this, them bitches get fucked, my dick get sucked

We never thought it would amount to much.
And now we're making history, maybe not quite.

Hani Stempler,"To me, to me love is no go
Till fiddle and oboe start weeping, and wailing
That's my failing
He may be all wrong for me
But his is the only song for me

I know he's around when the sky and the ground start in ringing
I know he is near 
By the thunder I hear in advance

His words, his words alone
Are the words that can start my heart singing
'Cause his is the only music that makes me dance

He'll sleep and he'll rise
In the light of two eyes that adore him
And bore him it might
But he won't leave my sight for a glance

In every way, every day
I need less of myself and more him, more him

Hanjin,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,

Over the shadows and the rain

And told his plans to me, so

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Hank Crawford,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Hank Crawford,"If the hands of time
Were hands that I could hold,
I'd keep them warm and in my hands
They'd not turn cold.

Hand in hand we'd choose
The moments that should last.
The lovely moments that
Should have no future and no past.

The summer from the top of the swing,
The comfort in the sound of a lullaby,
The innocence of leaves in the spring,
But most of all the moment
When love first touched me!

All the happy days
Would never learn to fly,
Until the hands of time
Would choose to wave Goodbye.",Brian's Song

Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
