Lunik,"You want me to be a fellow-believer
You want me to be part of a good majority
I can't never ever be your disciple

You want me to be a fellow-believer
You want me to be submissive, to be full of loyalty
I can't never ever agree
Mastermind set me free
I cannot find any reason to agree
With mastermind don't want to be
In mental custody

You want me to be a collaborator
You want me to be thoughtless like a trimmer has to be
But I'll never ever be your plaything

You want me to be a collaborator
To fit into the rules of a good society
But I'm sure I'll find a way to leave",Mastermind
Lunik,"I smiled at you
But you didn't see
I asked you something
You didn't answer me
I touched you,
Felt nothing-cause you're not here anymore

Stop pretending to sleep in your bed
Stop pretending to dream

I sat near you
You didn't even  notice
I told you stories
You didn't listen nor hear anything
I looked at you for a long while
But you didn't wake up for looking at me- cause you're not here anymore

I closed the window slowly
â??Cause I was freezing
So finally I understood, that you're not here anymore 

I disclosed you my love
That you didn't return
A wolf yelled at the moon
It broke the silence in me",Pretender
Lunik,"Change the fad
Throw this number far away
I thought
That I'd found my part
I was wrong- my mistake
Now I'm trying to fill the void
I'm broken: always the same thing when other people are around:
Like an unintended rescue the shadow-mask clings to my neck
Choking claws, playin' my part, choking claws

I'd just like to be who I am
Where should I start to seek?
In my reflection I learn
There's something behind 

Tug-of-war
Between me, myself and I
I could scream
But I laugh
I could breath but I lie
I could win but I loose
The dirty, greasy costume on my skin, I cannot push it away
Calm down, calm down, inhale the screaming silence",Sentimento
Lunik,"I'm a little fish
In muddy waters
I am on my guard
I better duck
Stay on my side

hungry I am 
We living beings only
Try to stay alive
I don't really want 
To tangle with‘

and it's wise
To realise my size
In here
Wise
To realise that mice
I should never eat 'em

sometimes I d like
To be exempted
From the daily fight
For kindness and for acceptance

sometimes I try
To understand it
I cannot survive
Without adjustment
And compromise",Size
Lunik,"My best friend always used to say
Heed your inner voice
I always followed this advice
And sometimes it worked out fine
But what do I do if my mind is screamin' and orderin' so loud ?
Its shrill voice drowns out
The soft one inside me

And I feel nothing
My mind is givin' orders
And I'm feelin' static

I wish my heart was stronger
But I try to refuse
But I'd lie if I said that I succeed

And when I try to find the reason
My mind goes out on strike
I ask and moan, complain about it
But it doesn't change the facts
In spite of me my mind goes on searchin' for the right way
My inner voices speak to me
But I can't seem to hear them",Static
Lunik,"Air
I was breathing it
It's staring yet
Fixed and frozen
I dare
To go off the air
Right there

Mare
I was believing it
Unessential yet
Forgotten
There
I'll pull my luck out of
Thin air

wherever I go
Supernova
Let me know
Wherever I go
That I'll grow

I'll seize
The opportunity
A fateful hour
To take to my heels
A fee
No fear no doubt
All of a heap",Supernova
Lunik,"You want me to be happy
So happy I am
I sing a song and you'll be amazed
And never miss it again
The same time it's a game
And I ll win because you don't see 
That I'm playing with you

You think that beinâ?? pensive
And melancolic's strange
It doesn't fit with all those others 
Who love to imitate each other and
Sing of superficial happiness, lies
For you to understand

Just once I want to try
To lie
'N I promise I won't  do it again
Just once I want to try
To lie
So here is my song for you
Because once I want to try

It needs a take off
To fly to the stars
To superficial paradise
So I do a take off
A take-off",Try
Lunik,"Trembling movements of his body
Smoking all day, all day long
Civilization he doesn't like it
But the strength to fight has gone
Then he's talking of the future
Of a better nicer world
And his eyes begin to glitter
I can't believe he doesn't move

He's waiting for a miracle
I see him waiting for so long

He's dreaming of a miracle
And it never ever comes

He's falling deeper, deeper, deeper
And he doesn't see the truth
He thinks one day it will be better
I know one day it will be too late
Cause he waited much too long
And he doesn't want to wake up

Lunik,"Your reproachful look says it all 
So does the silence between us 
(dissatisfaction bred envy)
How can you want to
Be what I am if you do
Not know me at all?
You're saying' I'm a loser
Even that you're not quite sure about 
(envy bred anger)
How can you want to
Have my life if you do not know it at all?
You have to know your life could be the dream that you dare to live...

You wanna be what I am
I wanna be what you are
You wanna be what I am
I wanna be what you are

You don't know what to say,
You're cryin', you never want to see me again
(anger bred sadness)
How can you want to
Do what I do
If you don't do anything at all?
""discriminated against me""?
If that's what you think- you better think again

Take a look at yourself
You're sitting here waiting for a miracle....
You have to know your life could be the dream that you dare to live...",What You Are
Lunik,"For years she didn't have a name
She needs me to give it back to her
Neither does she have a face
But I feel as though I know her well
She's younger than me, but buried so deep
What is she doin' in my dream'
She waits for me to solve her mystery
But how could I guess her name'

The distance between us fills the air
And I don't remember
She sheds a tear - it fills the air
But I don't remember
I hear her voice - it fills the air
But I can't remember her name
I don't remember her name

Breath of a dirty kid, bones of glass
She's keeping mum - her belly full of hate
Consciously hiding from her past
I can't leave her to her fate

I'm the one to help
She's bleeding - giving me the feeling

Hat it's my duty to dry her blood away
How can I guess her name'

A heart covered by footprints and scars
It's insane
I can't believe what she's showin' me
Who's the one to blame'
Oh those memories
Repression is a way to survive
Suddenly I remember her name
But I shudder to return it
I don't wanna share it

I don't wanna share
It's mine
No, I don't wanna share it
It's mine
I don't wanna share
It's mine
No, I don't wanna share it

Now I remember her name
Now I remember
And I try...to forget again",Her Name
Lunik,"Sunday afternoon and I just went for a walk
Back in my cocoon I miss our silly talks
It's so hard to let you go
Though there's no reason I should hold you back
I'm glad we said good-bye

Monday morning another week is taking off
And I remember the night we met the first time
When you said: ""Gotta light?""
I saw your smile and I fell for you right away
That's when I lost my mind, I'm reliving it every day

You didn't stay, I didn't die
My life will go on
A new day has begun without you
I'm tryin' not to glorify
It wasn't always fun
After a while I'll even forget your smile

It's Friday and I'm hanging 'round in bars with some
Friends
Suddenly it hits me that you never met them
Of course, it would be nice to have you here with us
I gotta resist the urge to call to hear your voice

You didn't stay, I didn't die
My life will go on
A new day has begun without you
I'm tryin' not to glorify
It wasn't always fun

I was yours, I called you mine
A little loan for a little time
I was tempted to keep it
I was struck all of a heap
But the shadows in your eyes, made me realize
That you're in disguise",New Day

Lunik,"There's this black knot inside of me
It can't be cried away
It will stay forever part of me
I accepted it one day
It can't be beaten out
I'm not it's master, not it's friend
Sometimes I think that it has gone
Later when I'm on my own - I don't

Don't you try to ease my pain
I need to brood, I need to cry
Let me rest, let me be
Let me suffer passionately
I'm on a psychologic slide
I'm on a melancholic ride

Walking on a flimsy rope
I need ?nothing"" to fall
With these forces I can't cope
I'm interior and small
At their first opportunity they attack me from the back
Again I turn off the phone
Feel a sudden sense of calm

Don't you try to ease my pain
I need to brood, I need to cry
Let me rest, let me be
Let me suffer passionately
I'm on a psychologic slide
I'm on a melancholic ride

Leave me now, and I will rise
When the darkness turns to light
I'll tackle my day, climb the mountain
Stay awhile, enjoy the sight
Until I slide again",Slide

Shivering autumn breeze
Outside the window
Decent and calm
Golden sunbeams on my nose

Bread fresh from the oven
Just the two of us
The day after a party
Drowsily snuggling up to you
Pyjamas all day long
Wasting time
Forgetting all

How could I ever want to have this all again
Cause when I had it last
I shared it with you
Alone it doesn't feel right - summer's gone
Summer's gone - and everywhere I see your face
Summer's gone - no one could ever take your place
Summer's gone - my heart doesn't take it yet for real

You picked it for me
On our lovers walk
Resting in a clearing
You're looking in my eyes
This must be a fairy tale

No puedes olvidarme...
Estoy en tu piel...

No quieres perder...
Ni un minuto sin mí ser...

And start to regret

Como yo así tu lo veras
Y en tu vida nadie te querrá
Lo que hiciste me las pagaras
Y en si mis manos tuviera un puñal
Lo usaría y la vida yo te quitaría
Por dejarme tan sola y vacía
Por mi madre que te arrastraría, vida mía

Como te hieren
Ya no me tienes 
No puedes

No sabes que ser amado

Y yo canto esta canción 
Me lleno de emoción
Y tu de confusión, desilusión
Mientas tu sufrirás

Como yo así tu lo veras

Y en tu vida nadie te querrá

Estaba loco por verte
Deseoso por tenerte
Quiero volver a su lado (Más Flow 3)
No importa que diga la gente
Le juro señora nunca le falle  (W, Yandel, El Rey Don Omar)

Decían que por ser menor que usted
Yo no la quería
Que no era amor solo interés
Y aquí estoy todavía

Señora usted me gusta tanto igual que el primer día
Bienvenida a la tercera dinastía
Se juntaron los que to el mundo quería
Para cumplir toditas sus fantasías
Con esa experiencia que usted me ha conquistado
Me tiene loco, me tiene enamorado
Y esa cinturita como que no ha cambiado
Y esta noche la quiero tener
Allá en mi cama
Topar tu calenta'o, prendió en llamas
Que el ronque dure hasta las tres de la mañana
Yo forever papa, tú forever mama
Aye malvada, tu mente de perversa
Como acelera cuando pone la reversa
Y choca con el hunter cazando la presa
No baje el fronte vamo a matarnos

Que la quiero mayor que yo, que yo
Que me de calor, que me de, de su amor
Me eduque en experiencia, me deje loco
Me lleve a la cama y me haga alucinar

Que la quiero mayor que yo, que yo
Que me de calor, que me de, de su amor
Me eduque en experiencia, me deje loco
Me lleve a la cama y me haga alucinar

Lunes a viernes tiene novio, pero el sábado lo deja
Aparece el domingo con la cara de pende
Ella se viste cara y el tipo se acompleja
El tiguere es su favorito me lo dijo en la oreja
Señora mía, saludable, rica, cero calorías
No has cambiado en nada tú sigues de reposteria
Quiero besarte de nuevo, me gustaria
Hay una sorpresa de Victoria, tú me la modelarías
Ese cuerpo no ha cambiado me tienes hipnotizado
Siempre fina, maquillado, tremendo calzado
Recordemos el pasado ya yo estoy desesperado
Completemos lo que no hemos terminado
Guille salvaje, de tinker bell el tatuaje
Cuando esta sola en su casa me llama pa que trabaje
La monto en mi viaje ella quiere cangrinaje
No tiene ropa interior debajo del traje

Quiere que le diga que en la cama usted es la que sabe

No hay hombre que la dome cuando ella aprieta

Me tiene enloquecido, estoy convencido
Que usted se va conmigo aunque me busque un lío
Yo no te obligo ma', si yo te sigo
Tranquila que de aqui nos vamos encendio

Yo sé que arrepentido no me quedare
Entre mis sabanas te encontrare
Sabes que soy el hombre, que más te conoce
Siendo tú mayor que yo

Luomo,"I guess you turn me on,
When you're gone,
For me it didn't go wrong,
we just made another song.

Off getting it alone,
Never asking if for long,
It's just that the world ain't enough,
And it never was for the two of us.

Baby, it's okay.

I guess you made me warm,
When you do the hum,
Making everybody come,
Getting creative with your charm.

I tried to be all yours,
Over line ain't answering your calls,
Don't say it's false,
I'm only following my thoughts.

Baby it's okay,
We'll make it better,
Baby, I, I'll survive,
Without these women in my life.",Tessio
Lupe Fiasco,"First off say peace to Pine Ridge
Shame at all the damage that the white man wine did
Ghost Dance, Trail of Tears, 5 million beers a year
And all that other crime did
More peace to the teachers of blind kids
To rebels in small cells keeping their mind big
Say everything's hostile
Suicide bombers and prosperity gospels, emaciated models
With cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils, they got to
Just to stay awake on the catwalk of life where everybody watch you
Straight hair, high heels and a handbag
Crucifixes, racism and a land grab
Katrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags
A peace sign and a pants sag
A money toss cause a 9 stripper mad dash
A friend request following a hash tag
Now everybody want it like a last laugh
A Michael Jackson jacket or a daft mask
Purple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class
Stable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad
But corporate jets really had to have that gas bad
War and they hope they all fall from the ratatat
Cause that's just more dinosaur for the Cadillac

Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

And we marvel at the state of Ottoman
Then turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can
America's a big motherfuckin' garbageman
If you ain't know, you're part and parcel of the problem
You say no you ain't, and I say yes you is
Soon as you find out what planned obsolescence is
You say no they didn't, and I say yes they did
The definition of unnecessary-ness manifested
Say that we should protest just to get arrested
That goes against all my hustling ethics
A bunch of jail niggas say its highly ineffective
Depart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip
Insert Baldwin to similar the separate
To me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit
Or finding really fast internet to have some sex with
It's all one song short of a set list
Couple croissants shy of a continental breakfast
Or blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish
So absurd, word to Chief Bone Necklace
Down at the Lakota Sioux Casino
A whole culture boiled down to giving you pokeno
I go as left as a heart in the chest
Cause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death

Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

An all white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler
Hope and pray they take Columbus day up off the calendar
South Central an example of God's gifts
So shout to all the mothers raising babies in SPA 6
The projects of Oakland city, Detroit ghost towns
Monopolies on poverty where D-boy coke bound
It’s parts of Manila like the video for ""Thriller""
But the US Embassy is reminiscent of a villa
If poverty is chocolate and privilege vanilla
Then what’s the flavor of the Sunday preacher’s pedophilia
Cash rules everything around these niggas
As classrooms everywhere around me wither
Hither you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers
The tyrant or the slave but nowhere in the middle
Of the extremes of America’s dream
Freud fighting Neo, Freddy Krueger refereeing, now…

Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

With a circle on the floor he compels them to be pure
Pulls the beast out of his heart then impales it on a sword
Writes a prayer on some paper and then he nails it to the door
Just the good of you may enter by the mercy of the lord
Listen not to what he speaks, that's been the cursing of his cause
A seduction of his senses by the devils he adores
The unholy has him hostage and his soul is now at war
Follow not his secret knowledge it will bring you no reward
Shunning while in public disallow him from your stores
Have no part in his affairs 'less his pestilence be yours
Make scoundrels of the righteous and virgins into whores
But we must still pray that his colour will be cured

With her eyes to the ceiling and a needle in her brain
He looks back into the crowd, wipes the blood and then explains
How she slipped from this existence to the realm of the deranged
Her becoming must be halted to reverse what she became
From the looseness of her tongue, to the pollution of her aims
To do nothing is barbaric, the solution is humane
You must destroy the mind and hopefully retrain
You torture out the wildness, then replace it with the tame
Blank slate when she recovers, she won't even know her name
Perfect wife and perfect lover, no resistance, no complaints
May God bless the scientific cure for the insane
Knew she couldn't go to school, but she thought that that should change

With his crucifix inside his pocket said his mission is divine
Put his bible on the bed and then he touched on his behind
Told him take off all his clothes and put your penis next to mine
Now the little boy think it's normal because they do this all the time
With no life inside his body now he finally think he’s safe
But they cut off all his fingers while they piss all in his face
He take pictures with his killers then they sneak back to the states
Now he sit next to the picture of his wife when she was raped
With the teleprompter rolling he looks right into the lens
Doesn’t mention his redemption but absolves him of his sins
He forgives them in advance says that he will do again

Scared of heights so I might pass out if he flies
Keep him on autopilot 'cause I can't drive

There's crooked police that's stationed at the knees
And they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs
And there's a car chase goin on at the waist

And where's the champagne? We need champagne

Soundtrack what's poppin' baby
Ya'll ain't know
I go by the name of
Lupe Fiasco
Representin' that 1st & 15
Yea
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grindin' (ya know what I'm saying)
Legally and Illegally
Ha
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
So, check it out

First got it when he was six
Didn't know any tricks
Matter fact
First time he got on it he slipped
Landed on his hip and bust his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp
Like this
Now we can end the story right here 
But shorty didn't quit it was something in the air
Yea
He said it was somethin' so appealing
He couldn't fight the feelin'
Somethin' about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it
Couldn't understand it
Brand it, since his first kickflip he landed
Uh
Labeled a misfit, abandoned
Ca-kunk, ca-kunk, kunk
His neighbors couldn't stand it, so
He was banished to the park
Started in the morning wouldn't stop till after dark
Yea
When he said it's getting late in here
So ""I'm sorry young man there's no skating here""

[Chorus]
So we Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast
And the way he roll just a rebel to the world with no place to go
So we Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast
So come and skate with me, just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's Kick, and Push, and Coast

Push down with the right, lift up with the left
Push down with both feet man, now land that shit fresh
We used to ride around just doin' that
With some used Airwalks and Billabong on my back
Happily because my mom couldn't afford it
When it came to Black validity, I guess they felt shorted
Identity crisis, they scrunched they facial
How we both black and our kid is biracial?
Okay, let me simplify the story yo
I was black but white in the middle like an Oreo
I skateboarded past all the shit I coulda been
I know my dead homies wish they was much gooder then
I mean gooder then, not cuz I'm better than
See, Airs got hooder man, blood got wetter than
I was just tryna bring it home and set a trend
But they would just yawn like it's Late Night for Letterman
I'm tryna tell 'em, it ain't no chance it's a fad
But they look at my Sadplant like a plant that was sad
These niggas count more grants than my dad
From all the cocaine in the grams of a bag
Skateboard P stand for skateboard past
All the bullshit that the devil's plans had
It grew up happy man, that plant wasn't sad
So I put it in Vanity Fair and the Zoo York ad
And I cooked it up to a crystallized dream
Take a puff, don't that taste like ice cream?
My record come out, the store calls your girl
Hate it or love it, I warthog the world
Yezzur

So he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push
Coast, and the way he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
So he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push
Coast, so come and skate with me
Just a rebel, looking for a place to be
So let's kick, and push, and coast

[Chorus]

Yea uh, yea, yea
Before he knew he had a crew
That weren't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB Dunks
They would Push, till they couldn't skate no more
Office building, Lobbies weren't safe no more
And it wasn't like they weren't getting chased no more
Just the freedom is better than breathing they said (they said)
And they escape route, they used to escape out
When things got crazy they needed to break out (they'd head)
To any place with stairs, any good grinds the world was theirs, uh
And they four wheels would take them there
Till the cops came and said ""There's no skating here""

How do you forgive the murderer of your father?
The ink of a scholar is worth a thousand times more than the blood of a martyr)

We came through the storm, nooses on our necks
And a smallpox blanket to keep us warm
On a 747 on the pentagon lawn
Wake up, the alarm clock is connected to a bomb

Anthrax lab on a west Virginia farm
Shorty ain't learned to walk already heavily armed
Civilians and little children is especially harmed
Camouflaged Torahs, bibles and glorious Qu'rans
The books that take you to heaven and let you meet the Lord there
Have become misinterpreted, reasons for warfare
We read em with blind eyes I guarantee you there's More there
The rich must be blind because they didn't see the poor there

Need to open up a park? Just close 10 schools
We don't need em
Can you please call the fire department they're down here marching for freedom
Burn down their TV's, turn their TV's on to teach 'em

The more money that they make
The more money that they make
The better and better they live
Whatever they want to take
Whatever they want to take
Whatever, whatever it is
The more that you want to learn
The more that you try to learn
The better and better it gets

Now the poor Klu Klux man say that we're all brothers
Not because things are the same because
we lack the same color that's green, now that's mean
Can't burn his cross cause he can't afford the gasoline
Now if a Muslim woman strapped with a bomb on a bus,
With the seconds running give you the jitters?
Just imagine a American-based Christian organization
planning to poison water supplies to bring the second-coming quicker
Nigga, that ain't livin' properly
Break 'em off a little democracy
Turn their whole culture to a mockery
Give em coca-cola for their property
Give em gum, give em guns, get em young, give em fun
But if they ain't giving it up, then they ain't getting none
And don't give em all, no ,man, just give em some
It's the paper, then these cops must be Al-Qaeda

The more money that they make
The more money that they make
The better and better they live
Whatever they want to take

Don't give the black man food, give red man liquor

Give red man craps, slot machines",American Terrorist
Lupe Fiasco,"He came back in the same suit that he was buried in
Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
Yes, he was still fresh to death
Bling, two earrings, a chain laying on his chest
He still had it 'cause they couldn't find it
And the bullets from his enemies sat like two inches behind it
Smell the Hennessey from where his niggas got reminded
And poured out liquor in his memory, he didn't mind it
But, he couldn't sip it fast enough
So the liquor was just filling the casket up
Floating down by his feet was the letter from his sister
Second-grade handwriting, simply read, I miss you
Suit-jacket pocket held his baby daughter's picture
Right next to it, one of his men stuck a swisha
He had a notion as he lay there soaking
He saw that the latch was broken, he kicked his casket open and he

Not at all nervous as he dug to the surface
Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
And when he couldn't dirt-spit, he swallowed it, working like a
Hmmm reverse archaeologist
Except, his buried treasure was sunshine
So when some shined through a hole that he had drove
It reflected off the gold and almost made son blind
He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
Pulled himself up out of his own grave, and looked at the time
On the watch that had stopped six months after the shots
That had got him in the box, ringing Henney out his socks
He figured it was hours, because he wasn't older
Used some flowers to brush the dirt up off his shoulder, so
With a right hand that was all bones
And no reason to stay, he decided to walk home, so he?

He begged for some change, to get him on the train
Damn that nigga stank, is what they complained
Tried to light the blunt but it burst into flames
Caught the reflection in the window of what he became
A long look, was he shook, was it the shame?
Matter of fact, the only thing on his brain was brains
Yeah, and getting back in his lane, doing his thing
First he had to find something to sling
Next stop was his block, it had the same cops
He walked right past the same spot where he was shot
Shocked, and some little niggas tried to sell him rocks
It just felt weird, being on the opposite
They figured that he wasn't from there so they pulled out
And robbed him with the same gun they shot him with
They put it to his head and said, you're scared, ain't cha?
He said, ""hustler for death, no heaven for a gangsta"", and

As I spy from behind my giant robot's eyes
I keep 'em happy cause I might fall out if he cries
Scared of heights, so I might pass out if he flies
Keep 'em on autopilot cause I can't drive
Room enough for one, I tell my homies they can't ride
Unless they sittin' on the shoulders but that's way too high
Let's try, not to step on the children,
The news camera's filmin', this walkin', project building
Now there's hoes selling hoes, like right around the toes
And the crack heads beg, at about the lower leg
There's crooked police, that's stationed at the knees
And they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs
And there's car chase, going on at the waist
Keep a vest on my chest
I'm sitting in my room, as I'm looking out the face

And can you please put your titties closer to the 22's
And where's the champagne, we need champagne
Now look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand
And know hold up your chain, slow motion through the flames
Now cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain
But not too loud 'cause the baby's sleepin'
I wonder if it knows what the world is keeping
Up both sleeves while he lay there dreamin'
Me and my robot tip-toe round creepin'
I had to turn my back on what got you paid
I couldn't see half the hood on me like Abu Ghraib
But I like to thank the streets that drove me crazy
And all the televisions out there that raised me

Let you leave
I don't know what you want
You want more from me?

She said to him
""I want you to be a father
He's your little boy and you don't even bother
Like ""brother"" without the are
And he's starting to harbor
Cool and food for thought
But for you he's a starver
Starting to use red markers on his work
His teacher say they know he's much smarter
But he's hurt

Used to hand his homework in first
Like he was the classroom starter
Burst to tears
Let them know she see us
Now he's fighting in class
Got a note last week that say he might not pass
Ask me if his daddy was sick of us

Cause you ain't never pick him up
You see what his problem is?
He don't know where his poppa is

No positive male role model
To play football and build railroad models
It's making a hole you've been digging it
Cause you ain't been kicking it

Since he was old enough to hold bottles
Wasn't supposed to get introduced to that
He don't deserve to get used to that
Now I ain't asking you for money or to come back to me
Some days it ain't sunny but it ain't so hard
Just breaks my heart
When I try to provide and he say, ""Mommy that ain't your job""
To be a man, I try to make him understand
That I'm his number one fan
But its like he born from the stands
You know the world is out to get him, so why don't you give him a chance?""

Lupe Fiasco,"Now I ain't trying to be the greatest
I used to hate hip-hop, yup, because the women degraded
But Too Short made me laugh, like a hypocrite I played it
A hypocrite I stated, though I only recited half
Omitting the word ""bitch,"" cursing I wouldn't say it
Me and dog couldn't relate, til a bitch I dated
Forgive my favorite word for hers and hers alike
But I learnt it from a song I heard and sorta liked
Yeah, for the icing, glamorized drug dealing was appealing
But the block club kept it from in front of our building
Gangsta rap-based filmings became the building blocks
For children with leaking ceilings catching drippings with pots
Coupled with compositions from Pac, Nas's ""It Was Written""
In the mix with my realities and feelings
Living conditions, religion, ignorant wisdom and artistic vision
I began to jot, tap the world and listen, it drop

My mom can't feed me, my boyfriend beats me
I have sex for money, the hood don't love me
The cops wanna kill me, this nonsense built me
And I got no place to go
They bomb my village, they call us killers
Took me off they welfare, can't afford they health care
My teacher won't teach me, my master beats me
And it hurts me soul

I had a ghetto boy bop, a Jay-Z boycott
Cause he said that he never prayed to God, he prayed to Gotti
I'm thinking godly, God guard me from the ungodly
But by my 30th watching of ""Streets is Watching""
I was back to giving props again and that was bothering
By this uncomfortable as a untouchable touching you
The theme songs that niggas hustle to seem wrong but these songs was coming true
And it was all becoming cool
I found a condom on the ground that Johns would cum into and thought
What constitutes a prostitute is the pursuit of profit then they drop it
The homie in a suit pat her on the butt, then rock it
It seems I was seeing the same scene adopted
Prevalent in different things with the witnesses indifferent to stop it
They said don't knock it, mind ya business
His business isn't mine and that nigga pimping got it

They took my daughter, we ain't got no water
I can't get hired, they cross on fire
We all got suspended, I just got sentenced
So I got no place to go
They threw down my gang sign, I ain't got no hang time
They talk about my sneakers, poisoned our leader
My father ain't seen me, turn off my TV
Cause it hurts me soul

So through the Grim Reaper sickle sharpening
Macintosh marketing
Oil field auguring
Brazilian adolescent disarmament
Israeli occupation
Islamic martyrdom, precise
Yeah, laser guided targeting
Oil for food, water, and terrorist organization harboring
Sand camouflage army men
CCF sponsoring, world conquering, telephone monitoring
Louis Vuitton modeling, pornographic actress honoring
String theory pondering, bullimic vomiting
Catholic priest fondling, pre-emptive bombing and Osama and no bombing them
They breaking in my car again, deforestation and overlogging and
Hennessy and Hypnotic swallowing, hydroponic coughing and
All the world's ills, sittin on chrome 24-inch wheels, like that

They say I'm infected, this is why I injected
I had it aborted, we got deported
My laptop got spyware, they say that I can't lie here
But I got no place to go

Children of the hat tiltin' keepin hope alive now
All with no high I do It so fly

Am I clean as my her-re-shy's, see the hare is trying to beat me

Really hates the box but he can't remember how to stop, it

Hopin that it'll give him somethin' that he can box with
Or how the locksmith, see the box as, locked in the box

Ain't got the combination to unlock, it
That's why he watch-es, scared to look away
'Cause at that moment, it might show him
What to take off the locks with

So he chained hisself to the box, took a lock and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and then forgot, it

And just left this instrumental, like that

And he never lies (uhh, he never lies, he never lies, no)

Everything he hears he absorbs and adopts it
Anything not comin out the box he blocks it
See he loves to box and hope they never stop it

Anything the box tell him to do, he does it
Anything it tell him to get, he shops and he cops it
He protects the box, locks it in a box
When he goes to sleep, but he never sleeps

'Cause he stays up to watch it, scared to look away
'Cause at that moment, it might get stolen
And that's the last of the boxes
So he chained himself to the box, took a lock and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and then forgot, it

As the doctors jot it all down, with they pens and pencils

You buy new clothes to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start

You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start

Uhh, and you can't tell me just who you are
You burn them flows just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars

Matter fact first time he got on it he slipped

For a week he had to talk with a lisp like this
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit it was something in the air
Yea he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it couldn't understand it brand it
Since the first kick flip he landed
Labeled a misfit a bandit cucump cucump cucump
His neighbors couldn't stand it
So he was banished to the park started in the morning
Wouldn't stop till after dark
Yea when they said its getting late in here so I'm sorry young man there's no skating here

So he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
And away he rolled jus' a rebel to the world with no place to go
So he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
So come and skate with me just a rebel looking for a place to be
So lets kick and push and coast

My man got a little older became a better a roller
Yea no helmet hell he'll end up killing himself
Is what his momma said but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what was happening to him now
He said I would marry but I'm engaged to the aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two
She said bow I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds
Now let me make one thing clear I don't need to ride yours I got mine right here
So she took him to a spot he didn't know about
Something odd in a apartment parking lot she said I don't normally take dates in here
Security came and said I'm sorry there's no skating here

So they kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
And away they roll jus lovers in the twine with no place to go
So they kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
So come and skate with me jus a rebel looking for a place to be
So lets kick and push and coast

Before he knew he had a crew
There wasn't no punk in they spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push till they could skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing they said
And the skate route they used to escape out
When things got crazy they needed to break out
They head to any place with stairs any good grinds the world was theirs
And they four wheels will take them there until the cops came and said there's no skating here

So they kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
And away they roll jus' rebels without a cause with no place to go
So they kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
So come roll with me jus' a rebel looking for a place to be
So just kick and push and coast","Kick, Push"
Lupe Fiasco,"Look at what we did, came a long way from Dirty Ghetto Kids (Uh, yeah)
Look at what we did, came a long way from Dirty Ghetto Kids (Yeah)
You know what it is (Haha, uh, uh, come on)
When the cops didn't find him for grindin' though
They kinda blew the vibe, figured it was time to go
Plus, he had to at home a long time ago
And he had made like ten dollars off the sign he wrote
It read, ""A little hungry, and need a little money,
It's for my little sister, and her little tummy.""
Wasn't lyin' though didn't go buy hydro
Went to the restaurant and bought two gyros
'Cause he knew they wasn't cooking where he lived
Da-kook-akook-akook's now took him to the crib
A little hurt from the rail he took into the ribs
Right bast the pushers who couldn't underdig
""What's the use of pushin' if you ain't pushin' none of this""
If I kick with y'all I'm just pushin' for a bit
But, what was on his mind had pushed him to the lid
They best customer wasn't cooking for a kid
Yes sir

So he kick, push
Over his shoulders he swore he'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive (Yeah, uh)
And so he kick, push
Over his shoulders he swore he'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive (yeah)

You see his mom was a crackhead and his father couldn't be contacted
He lived with being different, was combated
Amongst the other things on his young, black head
And see, his girl was a white girl
But, just cause she was white, see her life wasn't light-world
She, too had the drama thick
Had a daddy and a momma, but her daddy used to momma hit
Daddy caught something, chasing fatties made her momma sick
Couldn't afford the medicine, pimped it to the pharmacist
As suicidal feelings would rise, switch over to transitions, helped her conquer it
Pays for her momma's pills with a sponsorship
A cell phone bill and a Honda kit Uh-huh
And that's why she skates with him
Someone to feel her pain and her place to be

So he kick, push
Over his shoulders he swore he'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive (Yeah, uh)
And so he kick, push
Over his shoulders he swore he'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive (yeah)

A traveling band of misfits and outcasts
Knock their heads from Misfits to Outkast
A lot of scars, they did this without pads
A lot of hearts, who did this without dads
One's father was filthy rich, two was middle class, and one was homeless
Add in a paralyzed girl in a wheelchair who just liked to watch it, that was the whole clique
I think about it every time I see this old flick
That was taken in the park, in front of this old bench
They wrote on the back, ""You thank for push, kick, hope you make a video, the beat is so sick.""
Well, I did, I hope you seen it It's on MTV, Soundtrack's a genius
Love from Tony Hawk, beat from the Ice Creamer's
Before we out it out had to pay the Filipino's
Just to show 'em how

So he kick, push
Over his shoulders he swore he'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive (Yeah, uh)
And so he kick, push
Over his shoulders he swore he'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive (yeah)","Kick, Push, Pt. II"

Jay, Lupe!

Yeah,
And so it seems that I'm, sewing jeans
And, 1st and 15 is just a sewing machine
So I, cut the pattern and I, sew in seams
And, button in this hustling then publicly I'm Buddy Lee
There's no busting them and cuffing them is like
Ushering in the regime, they want me to make Prince pants
But I withstand, I ain't gotten into that
A little big in the waist, Tupac it on the back
Call them Nu-vi's, O.G.'s covered in blue dye
Give 'em the game, that's like giving chocolate to the fat
Look, how you think I got here?
That's the same game that came through where I lived as a kid
In the bad luck truck and threw boxes off the back
Made me a ripper, deliver like river
Content a little more thicker, slicker
Yeah, and they said oil and water don't mix
Now they all down at the beach washing off the fish
Was Blackbeard 'til I brought the Roc into your ships
Yeah!

[Chorus]
It's my life, my life, everything I do I do for you
I do it all for you, everything I say you know it's the truth
I'll say it is the truth, I'll take all the pressure off of you
Take pressure off of you, I'll take, the pressure off of you

[Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah!
Uhh, it's hella proper (proper)
Cause it sag so low you can see boxer, like a boxer's
That's the way that the Family's pants worn
Then we slide, and try and put 'em on
The stones in the pocket'll drag you down to Davy Jones locker
Beware if you wanna Roc the Knickerbocker
Other nigga from the block what, they was selling O's
Like Wheel of Fortune, of imported cocaine
Just to feel important, it was +Do or Die+
They was tired of being ""Po' Pimps,"" now for sure
That was just a product of my common sense
I guess, I was just guessing like the consonants
Momma said beware of what the devil do
Tell 'em that your soul's not for sale like the W's
So go ahead and pirate, the highest
Cannons make you leak like pirated my shh, 
It's no shh, it's just shh like quiet
And big homey's out of retirement

Uhh, Young, uhh
So the pen is mightier than the sword my lord
My first picture was a line-up, now I'm on the Forbes
And I still remain the artiste through thees all
If you force my hand I'll be forced to ""draw""
If the war calls for war halls
Hope you got enough space on your hall's walls
I make niggas murals, then escape the bureau's
Investigation, out in Europe on vacation
I'm back for these puppies with the pound boy
(Blaow) Here's a round boy (blaow blaow) down boy
Sound boy, you don't wanna sound clash loud noise
Leave niggas paranoid if not paralyzed
Which means you can't walk in my shoes
Too much green you can't talk in my hue
Extend the team, nigga holla at Lu'

Uh, Food & Liquor
Yeah, my man said he wanted something real, 
Real, real, real, real
Something he could recognize, something he could feel,
Feel, feel, feel, feel
Baby girl said she was in the mood for something real,
Real, real, real, real
Something that could make her move
Something she could feel, feel, feel, feel

Lust, sometimes can override trust
She said that's why she gave it up
My man said blood spilled out of everything he touched
He crushed everything he crushed
Ruined everything he loved, he just wanted to rush
Blamed it on the times being rough
Doing dirt, with the devil, chasing after the dust
Make a fuss, if it's them, but we hush, if it's us

That's why, my momma said she wanted something real,
Real, real, real, real
Something she could be proud of, something she could feel,
Feel, feel, feel, feel
She said they so used to not having nothing real,
Real, real, real.. real
That they don't know how to act
They don't know how to feel, feel, feel, feel

Life, ain't meant to come around twice
Yeah, that's why I gotta get it right
They said I got it honest now I gotta give it life
But sleep on it, that's why God give you night
I mean, I had a dream that, God gave me flight
Too fly for my own good so, God gave me plight
If I wake up in the morning now I gotta give 'em sight
Make 'em see, break 'em free, ain't a G, sho' you right

The game is not to give 'em nothing real, 
Real, real, real, real
Nothing they could use, nothing that they could feel,
Feel, feel, feel, feel
Give 'em a bunch of lies and teach 'em that it's real,
Real, real, real, real
So that's all that they a-know
That's all that they a-feel, feel, feel, feel

Struggle, yeah yeah, another sign that God love you
Cause on the low, being po', make you humble
Keep they names in my rhymes to try and keep them out of trouble
Cause being po', also teach you how to hustle
All they want is some shoes or some rims for they bubble
Now that I got my own, I can hit them with a couple
Cuff, my homies so they ain't got no reason to cuff you
That's my plan, if I can, on the man, up above you

That's why, I gotta give 'em something real,
Real, real, real, real
Something they could recognize, something they could feel,
Feel, feel, feel, feel
To my homies on the block I gotta give 'em something real,
Real, real, real, real
Something that'll make 'em stop
Something they can feel, feel, feel, feel

Yo! For real, really real, yeah!

Lupe Fiasco,"Uh, Fresh to def she is
From her steps to the set she is
So ""death"" might not let me live
Ya dig
Fresh uh huh, yes she is
Had a feeling that it would be a day like this
The orchestra in my mind don't play like this (naw),
But I'm prepared for it
Got a lil rare for it
Brushed off my airs
Even cut my hair for it
'Cause normally I don't care for it
Don't even be looking for like, like that
Then there go it
Yea right over there so I prepare the poet
Lil scared my stair lowered
Momma said have no fear
Plus I'm already outta my chair
God love my airs on my square from here forward
It's nuthin right so here go it
Whisper in the air ""its kinda crowded in here""
Would she care to blow it she said ""yea""

You're my sunshine (you're my sunshine),
You're my moonlight (you're my moonlight),
You're the starry skies above me won't you please come down and hug me,
Think I found love in this club tonight (Wowowowo)

Never met her before
But I think I like her like a metaphor
It's hard to get
In the car we sit
From the intro
She rolled down her window
Just in case I was a schitzo

So I compliment her on the common sense
I'm calm
A lil more confident (Uh Huh)
And then we lose consciousness
She says ""that I've been waiting for you""
And I know you been chasing me too
Since they kidnapped me from a castle
I been thinking of you
I told a fire breathing dragon ""he bet not harm me"" or he be sorry when he meets my one man army
And thou has come to rescue me
My knight in shining armor, yes you be
Woken up by the horn of an SUV
I said ""see, too beautiful to let you sleep""

You're my sunshine (you're my sunshine),
You're my moonlight (you're my moonlight),
You're the starry skies above me won't you please come down and hug me,
Think I found love in this club tonight (Wowowowo)

Relationship is just 30 minutes long
It's kinda heavy maybe a lil strong
""Go and take"" much more than once
Can't trust what each of us say at least for a month
Or two before I bid you adieu
Do this one thing for me outta the trillions of numbers that's in the world
Just leave me a few that lead to you
Won't be longing I see you in the morning

You're my sunshine (you're my sunshine),
You're my moonlight (you're my moonlight),
You're the starry skies above me won't you please come down and hug me,

If you are what you say you are

Then have no fear the crowd is here and the lights are on and they want a show
Oh oh oh oh

Yea, uh
A fresh cool young Lu
Trying to cash his microphone check 2, 1, 2
Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees
What have you brung you
Did you improve on the design
Did you do something new
Well your name ain't on the guest list
Who brung you, you
The more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you
You come to
And then it hit me
Standing outside of heaven waiting for god to come and get me
I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules
And two gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer
And too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle
I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who song blue
Go back what ever you did you undo
Heavy is heaven
The devil on my two tons too

If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement
Passed the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid
And out through china
Nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five
This is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest a blaze
Now that's important to say
Cause even with all of that
Most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow
Meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called
And they told him to wait
Un-strap him from the chair
And put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise
They want everything back that they paid
Cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim


If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh

So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
Cause I been standing in this line
For like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown
M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song
And mikes don't feed back
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that
And everybody claps cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know

Say he's back to poems, got their domes all geeked up
To get up on they thrones and become young leaders
Oprah put it on my culture now if that ain't wrong
Imus got it from the rhymers now if that ain't blown
They gave my man forty four now if that ain't long
I put it all on my shoulders now if that ain't strong
I made it out alive from the streets of the westside C-H-I
Now if that ain't home you better tell em

Gather 'round, go a-head and stare
(You street folks don't need permission my life's in hi-definition)
Listen with your eyes follow with your ears
(I don't need no intermission my life's in hi-definition)

And in my flyness I've become the hero and the sidekick
The rider and the nigga that'll ride with
In your ear like the maker of the vivrant
Asalamalakam to the maker of the vivrant
Them other niggas I don't vibe with
Now I was bout three when the eyes went
But I could see everything that you trying to be
You can't hide it
While you coming out your throat like a heimlich
I came up out the belly like an high scip
Only my circumstance reviced it
Hijacked the road and when they shot the pilot
I'm trying to go public so I can get to private
Then send Busy to go and get the pirates
Then hit Africa and try to fix the Virus
Go back to the hood tell Huggy open the hydrents
R.I.P Stack B. I'm gonna keep you alive kid
Dressed in something so fresh and wonderful

Lupy, it's Snoopyy lets go out/wild
Tip toe through the door do it doggy style
And tell all my chicks in Chi-I-cago
Lupy hit the Lotto, Snoopy hit the bottle
Dolemite tight they bite, they might follow
Take this chill pill, will make you swallow
Recital is very homicidal
The big screen will capture it, cause it's hi-definition
Listen cooking collard greens in the kitchen
Them alphabet boys on a mission
If you ever get cash you better get it quick fast
Cause now-a-days niggas get the snitching on your bitch ass
Even your boys, best believe in your toys, out your game
Specially when a nigga know your real name
Blam blam with the blammer
Smile nephew your on candit camera, film at eleven
Dressed in something so fresh and wonderful

Lupe Fiasco,"He said: ""I write what I see
Write to make it right, don't like where I be
I'd like to make it like the sights on TV
Quite the great life, so nice and easy""
See: now you can still die from that
But it's better than not being alive from straps
Agreed, a Mead notebook and a Bic
That click when it's pushed and a wack-ass beat
That's a track that's weak that he got last week
Cause everybody in the stu' was like: ""That's that heat!""
A bass-heavy medley with a sample from the 70s
With a screwed-up hook that went ""stack that cheese""
Something something something, ""stack that cheese""
Mother, sister, cousin, ""stack that cheese""
He couldn't think of nothin', ""stack that cheese""
He turns down the beat, writer's block impedes
Crying from the next room, a baby in need
Of some Pampers and some food and place to sleep
That plus a black Cadillac on Ds
Is what keep him on track to be a great MC

One you never heard of, I
Push it hard to further the
Grind, might feel like murder, but
Hip-Hop you saved my life

Reps North-side, so he rocks them braids
1100 friends on his Myspace page
""Stack That Cheese"" got 700 plays
Producer made him take it down, said he had to pay
Open mic champ 2 weeks in a row
Ex d-Boy with a b-boy flow
Glow like Leroy, you should see the boy go
Got a daddy serving life and a brother on the Row
Best homie in the grave, tatted up while in the cage
Minute Maid got his momma working like a slave
Down baby-momma, who he really had to honor
Cause she was his biggest fan, even let him use her Honda to
Drive up to Dallas, went to open up for amateurs
Let him keep a debit card so he could put gas in it
Told her when he get on he gon' take her to the Galleria
And buy everything but the mannequins, ya dig?

One you never heard of, I
Push it hard to further the
Grind, might feel like murder, but
Hip-Hop you saved my life

His man called, said: ""your time might be now
They played your freestyle over 'Wipe Me Down'
They played it 2 times, say it might be crowned
As the best thing out the H-town in a while""
He picked up his son with a great big smile
Rapped every single word to the newborn child
Then he put him down and went back to the kitchen
And put on another beat and got back to the mission of
Get his momma out the hood, put her somewhere in the woods
Keep his lady looking good, have her rolling like she should
Show his homies there's a way other than that flippin' yay
Bail his homie out of jail, put a lawyer on his case
Throw a concert for the school, show the shorties that it's cool
Throw some candy on the Caddy, chuck the deuce and act a fool
Man it feels good, when it happens like that
Two days from going back to selling crack, yessir",Hip-Hop Saved My Life

'Cause one day a rapist attacked her and broke
That all apart
She said there was no way to fix it
Or to cover her scars
Then one day a guy came along that
Probably could help her start
He was sincere made her believe it was safe
For her to trust again
Before long she was cool to givin hugs to him
Knew that it was right cuz somethin was wrong

Lupe Fiasco,"Now little Terry got a gun he got from the store
He bought it with the money he got from his chores
He robbed the candy shop told them lay down on the floor
Put the cookies in the bag; take the pennies out the drawer
Lil' Khalil got a gun he got from the rebels
To kill the infidels and American devils
A bomb on his waist, a mask on his face
Prays five times a day yet listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad
That he snuck into school in his black book bag
His black nail polish, black boots and black hat
He's gon' blow away the bully that just pushed his ass

I killed another man today
Shot him in his back as he ran away
Then I blew up his hut with a hand grenade
Cut his wife throat as she put her hands to pray
Just five more dogs then could get a soccer ball
That's what my commander says
How old? Well I'm like ten, eleven
Been fighting since I was like six or seven
Now I don't know much about where I'm from
But I know I strike fear everywhere I come
Government wants me dead so I wear my gun
I really want the rocket launcher but I'm still to young
This candy gives me courage not to fear no one
To feel no pain and hear no tongue
So I hear no screams and I shed no tear
If I'm in your dreams then your end is near

Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you, there's a war
If it comes not just too tall for you
You find you something small to use
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
Yanked you now, pow

Now here comes the march of the boy brigade
A McCar parade of the toys he made
And in shimmer shades who looks half his age
About half the size of the flags they waved
And camouflage suits made to fit youths
Cause the ones off dead soldier hang a little loose
With AK-47 that they shooting into heaven
Like they trying to kill the Jetsons
They struggle little recruits
Cute, smileless, heartless, violent
Childhood destroyed, avoided of all childish ways
Can't write their own names
Or read the words on their own graves
Think you gangsta popped a few rounds
These kids will come through and murder a whole town
And sit back and smoke and watch it burn down
The grave gets deeper the further we go down

Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you, there's a war
If it comes not just too tall for you
You find you something small to use
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
Yanked you now, pow

Imagine if I had to console
The family of those
Slayed that I slain on game consoles
I aim I hold, right trigger to squeeze
Press up and y one less nigga breathe
B for the bombs, press pause for your moms
Make the room silence she don't approve of violent games
She leaves resume activity
Start and blew hearts, with poor harsh wizardry
On next part I insert code
To sweeten up the purses of murder work load
I tell him he work for
CIA with A
And operative, I operate this game all day
I hold a controller connected to the soldier
With weapons on his shoulder, he's only seconds older than me
We playful but serious, now keep on mind for online experience

Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago
Mayne

I love her
And I hate to leave her lonely
Ring ring went the iPhone, it was my homie
He said, let's hit Japan
If we can make 'em jam
We can make a hundred grand
Spend it in the south of France
Nothing further, I jumped
Grabbed my Goyard trunk
Got ready to 'Walk it Out' like Unk
In my John Lennon chucks
That's when I heard Murder
You're killin me, you're fillin me
With sorrow, sunrise, goodbyes
And missin you tomorrow's
I turn to see
My dream love supreme queen, meanest thing on the scene, cry
I drop my bags in a flash
That's faster one 180 on that dash sir
To dry her tears
And wipe the rain from my dear like Dasher
You's the dame who's the user name to all my passwords
The reason I get fly is Ivan Jasper
I even keep your picture in my passport
Love, Love

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago
Mayne

Then we can land in the motherland
Camel back across the desert sand
Take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real

Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

So let's keep it, real
All in together, free Chill
Tell the stewardess to throw a movie on the reel
Heat up my kosher meal, exchange my dollar bills
Lean back in my first class seat, and sleep
Don't wake me till I land, when they barely understand
What I speak, but they nod to my beats
I tell my fans who I am, and they stand, and they clap
They applaud. They love me, my God
Otsukaresama deshita or maybe au revoir
A spree on Saint Henri, then back to Charles de Gaulle
So I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been
And, everything that I done, and
Tell her that she's the one, and, um

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago
Mayne

Then we can land in the motherland
Camel back across the desert sand
Take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real

Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

Guess who's back in the, house
With a bunch of souvenirs and a smile for your mouth
I really missed you, each and every night I kissed ya
In my dreams fore I went to sleep to lala land to count them sheep
I swear you're lookin' prettier than ever
It's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together ever more
For better or, less or poor, or worth our weight in buried treasure
X's on the shore
I know my world tour's like war to ya
But Ian said: Aloha, and Harley said: Cheers
Julian said: Bonjour!, Big O was like: Yeah
Amanda and Le Messie want to know when we goin' there
Edison sends his love, so does the rest of the club
Of the international playboys and playgirls
But I revoke my membership, all for My Tenderness
She said, Pursue your interests, cause even If
I'm ticket less, I'll be there, by your side
In your heart and, on your mind
So, as I taxi down another runway
I Gotcha, who loves you bay
Now bring it back, now

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago

Lupe Fiasco,"If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh
If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the crowd is here and the lights are on and they want a show
Oh oh oh oh

Yea, uh
A fresh cool young Lu
Trying to cash his microphone check 2, 1, 2
Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees
What have you brung you
Did you improve on the design
Did you do something new
Well your name ain't on the guest list
Who brung you, you
The more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you
You come to
And then it hit me
Standing outside of heaven waiting for god to come and get me
I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules
And two gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer
And too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle
I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who song blue
Go back what ever you did you undo
Heavy is heaven
The devil on my two tons too

If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement
Passed the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid
And out through china
Nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five
This is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest a blaze
Now that's important to say
Cause even with all of that
Most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow
Meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called
And they told him to wait
Un-strap him from the chair
And put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise
They want everything back that they paid
Cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim


If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh

So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
Cause I been standing in this line
For like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown
M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song
And mikes don't feed back
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that
And everybody claps cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh
If you are what you say you are

Then have no fear the crowd is here and the lights are on and they want a show

Like a villain would
If he was doin' bad
Kill Superman
Tied to a log
Push into a saw
Take a little dog

Like a definition
Like you never listen
Not the issue is it
But the deaf part
Break it in half
Like an intermission

What I mean then
Or what I meant there
Doesn't impair
Now you're learnin' it
Keep versin' it
'til it's permanent
Like pen-pal
Got an empire
I'm the emperor
Like the cat were
I'll be faster
Are you tryin' to ask her
Just slow me down
But I'm goin' down
Like a network
That's wolf-man
You got a full house
I got a full moon
Then I pull out
The ace-summer sleeve
Like my hand hurt
Lend me your chips
What they took now
What they put now
Gotta look down
And check your shoulder
'cause I'll be over
Like a boater
You got boaters
In your loafers
Put your foot down
While I ottoman
Or a Laz-E-Boy
Or a handstand
See I elevate

My toes is
And my flow sick
Let it marinate
Try to break it down
Might take a while
All good though

Like a lighthouse
In the daytime
Make it lay down
Make it go to bed
Make it go to sleep
Like D-bo
Who needs jumpin' cred
That's a headlock
It's what I said I got
The whole game is
Like shooter box
Then the Shokazuki
If you don't know the movies
I ninja vanish

I get super low
I get super lost
I be super cool
Like a super boss
Say they super bad
But they super soft
Like super chicken
Without the super sauce
Let's step out
It's a rap now
Blow your candles
And your lamps out
When I pull up
You can pull the plug

Lord please have sympathy
And forgive Michael Young history as
The coolest nigga, what

I love the Lord
But sometimes it's like that I love me more
I love the peace and I love the war
I love the seas and I love the shore
No love for no beach; baby, that's law
But she doesn't see; therefore, I spoil
I trick, I fall, run up in raw
I love her with all my heart
Every vein, every vessel, every bullet lodged
With every flower that I ever took apart
She said that she would give me greatness, status
Placement above the others
My face would grace covers
Of the magazines of the hustlers
Paper, the likes of which that I had never seen
Her eyes glow green with the logo of our dreams
The purpose of our scene
The obscene obsession for the bling
She would be my queen, I could be her king
Together, she would make me cool
And we would both rule
Forever
And I would never feel pain
And never be without pleasure, ever again
And if the reign stops and everything's dry
She would cry just so I can drink the tears from her eyes
She'd teach me how to fly, even cushion my fall
If my engines ever stall and I plummet from the sky
But she will keep me high, and if I ever die
She would commission monuments on her bosom to him
Or maybe she'd retire as well
A match made in Heaven, set the fires in Hell
And I'll be

The coolest nigga, what

Lord please have sympathy
And forgive Michael Young history as
The coolest nigga, what

And so began our reign
The Trinity: Her and I, caine
No weather man could ever stand when her and I came
Hella hard, umbrella, whatever
Put plywood over Pella panes
And pray to God that the flood subside
Cause you gon' need a sub til he does reply
And not one of Jared's; you think it's all arid
And e'eryt'ing's irie, another supply
That means another July inside my endless summer
That was just the eye of the Unger, Felix
Cause he is the cleanest amongst the
Younger outstanding achieving up-and-comers
The ones that had deadbeat daddies and well-to-do mommas
But not well enough to keep 'em from us
The ones that were fighting in class who might not pass
Rap record pressured to laugh at a life not fast
Can you feel it?
Is what I got asked
Do I love her?
Said, I don't know
Streets got my heart, Game got my soul
One time missing sunshine will never hurt your soul
Quote to a crying, dishonored baby mama
Who's the mama to the daughter that I had fathered from afar
My new lady gave me a Mercedes and a necklace with a solid gold key
Like the starter of a car, the opener of a door, or two pounds of raw
You gave me a baby, but what about lately?
Then ha-ha-ha-ha-ha'd right up in her face, G
There's more fish in the sea
I'm on my mission to be

The coolest nigga, what

Lord please have sympathy
And forgive Michael Young history as
The coolest nigga, what

Come, these are the tales of The Cool
Guaranteed to go and make you fail from your school
And seek unholy grails like a fool
And hang with the players of the pool

They love my darkness, I make them heartless
And in return they have become my martyrs
I've been in the poem of many a poet
And I reside in the art of many a artist
Some of your smartest have tried to articulate
My whole part in this
But they're fruitless in their harvest
The dro grows from my footsteps
I'm the one that they follow
I am the one that they march with

Let me hear you say alright, alright?
Ann what up?
Alright
Pooh bear!
I'm feeling good so I'mma say it myself
Alright? alright
Claudia
Alright
So how you gon' do this one

Uh,
This one goes out to the baby girls
In a rush growing up in this crazy world
Yeah your brother on the road and he never home
I know you feeling kinda sad now that daddy gone
You can't let it get you down, gotta carry on
We only lose things because it makes us strong
You always had my love, and now you got a song
From the biggest biggest fan that you've ever known
I know you want me, little girls, not for very long
And you ain't gotta have a man if you don't never want
Cause I'm gonna make sure you got two of everything
That you ever want, every tone, of your very own
Not to make you hard to respect
Just really really really really hard to impress
It's a whole wide world for you to go and get your hands on
Until then, just come and get your dance on now

I see you coming up
I'mma give you the low down, down, down,
You ain't never gotta worry about nothin'
Just as long as I'm around, round, round, round

Uh
This for everybody feeling good
You know who you are, or you misunderstood
Never had money, or you living good
If you from the burbs, if you in the hood
Recognize where we come from
In my day, mane, I did a little somethin' some'
They like ""how come you don't rap that?""
Cause that's a backtrack and I ain't tryna back back
I'm only moving forward homie that's that
Direction, a lot of shoulders lack that
I'm just trying give it to 'em like sat-nav
Now I know I might not make it like a fat rat
That's cool as long as he don't trap crack
Graduate from school, and still let his pants sag
Never catch a case, know how to let his cash stack
Welcome to the map and go anyway tap back now

I see you coming up
I'mma give you the lowdown, down, down (alright, alright)
You ain't never gotta worry about nothing (you ain't gotta worry)
Just as long as I'm around (as long as I'm here) round, round, round

And if the floor falls out
I'mma be there to carry you
And if you want that star
I'll go get it out the sky for you
If you gotta shed a tear
I'mma dry your eyes
Just to let you know it'll be alright

I know it's like a whole lot going on
Things going right, things going wrong
Maybe baby, I've been waiting for you so long
Know that in this world you're never really on your own
God got a number get him on the phone
He'll never put you places where you don't belong
Put you through the pain, to put you on the throne
And I know that from the bottom of my chromosome
And if they looking at you sideways
You just wave right back, tell 'em hi hater
Mad you ain't hanging with 'em in the driveway
Nah we going to keep it moving to the highway
Strongest putting on, the week is all over like Friday, chilling
Shout out to King David for bringing in the feelin'
And I'mma put the independent women in the building let's go

I see you coming up (I see you coming up yeah)
I'mma give you the lowdown (down) down (down) down (all the way down)

I'm not a choo-choo
I'ma turbo!
Hater pray to god that I turn slow
Like I'm sipping on purple
But I ain't on your glow
I'm in a whole 'nother circle
Trying to keep it clean like church clothes
Said that respect was something had to work for
But that ain't gonna work though
Get your respect, but lose all my worth no
You can dead that, get a hearse, go
Don't need 48 you'll find a killer in the first floor
It was me boy, too commercial
Feeling out of place like PETA at a fur store
So I left with a couple dozen fur coats
Said I could never break away from your hold
Watch me, turn up
Said that I blew it like Turquoise
Just mad hear it all in your word choice
Know it hurts but I really don't care though
Let me rub it in, get it all up in that hole

I can see the morning creeping up on us
It's like the world's in my hands now
I'm feeling so rebellious from all of the envy crowding around me
I don't wanna care right now
I don't wanna care, don't wanna care right now

I don't wanna care, don't wanna care right now
No I really don't, really don't, wanna care right now

You fly but stars over everything-thing
And I'm one of them, yeah one of th-the-them
Oh I'm not o-o-one? Well I'm a hundred th-the-then
I'm a hundred mother loving stars
You're no lights, you're an undercover car
I'm an ambulance, and a fire truck, and some strobe lights, tied up!
Shining all in your eyes, all out of yours and all into mine
Lights and stars is all intertwined
And I'm feeling like Malcolm looking all out the blinds
Any means any means, and you can do anything anything
And the flow tight, skinny jeans skinny jeans
Hit you like Pacquiao, Philippines Philippines

I can see the morning creeping up on us
It's like the world's in my hands now
I'm feeling so rebellious from all of the envy crowding around me
I don't wanna care right now

Got the game in the clutch like I N G
You ball little boy, But I N-B-A
With a hand for the world, you a boy band with a dance and a twirl
I'm a rockstar with a band so thorough
Big ass tour bus that's jammed full of girls

Lupe Fiasco,"Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
You are getting too heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go

My self portrait shows a man that the wealth tortured
Self-absorbed with his own self-forfeit
A shelf full of awards
Worshiping the war ships that set sail on my sea of life
When I see my own self I wonder if we still see a light
We was tight seeing lights
Speaking right and breathing life
Now I see my demons and barely even sleep at night
I don't get high, life keep me at a decent height
As the old me I predicted all my recent plights
Exhausted trying to fall asleep, losses at my recent fights
Burdens on my shoulders now, burnin' all my motives down
Inspiration drying up, motivation slowing down

Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
You are getting too heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go
(Think I'll let you go)

I'm begging me don't let me go
We vow like the letter ""O""
To never go our separate ways
And spin-off into separate shows
Tired of all the wardrobe changin'
Playing all these extra roles
Filled with all these different spirits
Livin' off these separate souls
Point in life is getting hollow
Can't wait for the exit hole
Give me room, the entry room, let me in and let me go
So I can roam around this wilderness
See it for what it really is
I'm prepared to filterless
Magnify the youth in me, alibi the shootin' spree
Amplify the revolution, sanitize the lunacy
Strip away the justice, justify the scrutiny
I can see the lasers shootin' out of you and me

Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
You are getting too heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go
(Think I'll be let you go)

Sometimes I feel like the world
Sometimes I feel like, the world is against me
And everything that I've done before
I swear we used to be so pure
But we can't be in love no more
Cause I don't wanna fight this war
But when I put down my gun
I turn around and pick up one
This uzi weighs a ton, but I think I'm done!

Things are getting outta control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
You are getting too heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go

Take me to memories we won't erase
Take me to all that we had
Good and the bad

I'll never forget you
I'll never let you go
I'll never forget you
I'll always remember, I hope you know

Let the record reflect the records we set
Best foot forward with every step
And let's push towards it, never regress
And let's remember, if ever we get
Down, the places that we came from 'round
And all the good times on the bad side of town
The upside of bad, flip it upside down
Came from the bottom but we up high now
Believe, and from this view we achieved
We looked back at the rules we received
And how we broke those, dismantled and rewrote those
And the ghost still alive in the photos
Sounds of the summer, day and go wise
Cold wind blowin' through a city on fire
Moments of the past, came here to find you
Not to relive them, just to remind you

Take me to that old familiar place
Take me to memories we won't erase
Take me to all that we had
Good and the bad

I'll never forget you
I'll never let you go
I'll never forget you
I'll always remember, I hope you know
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)

And let the evidence show, the future's so bright
It's never been more, not like tonight
We walk into the glow, right into the light
The past all around us, the time of our life
The first love kisses, the broke heart disses
This is just like a first-class ticket
Back, to the first written rap
The crumbled-up paper and the pen with no cap
The hand-me-down clothes and the unturned hat
The hookers on the corner and the kids sellin' crack
The needles in the yard where we used to play catch
Stories from the project we could never go at
Or to, these are shades of my youth
Trials of a child, everything truth
Moments of the past, comin' back to find us
Not to relive them, just to remind us

Take to that old familiar place
Take me to memories we won't erase
Take me to all that we had
Good and the bad

I'll never forget you
I'll never let you go
I'll never forget you
I'll always remember, I hope you know
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Everything cherished, remembered in my heart
So you will never perish, you will never part
I tell 'em all about you, drummin' in the park
We put you in the ground, but I see you in the stars
Gon', take a bow, a round of applause
The best that ever, always ready we are
Love always shines, that's how I'll find you
In case you forgot, I hope this reminds you now

Take to that old familiar place
Take me to memories we won't erase
Take me to all that we had
Good and the bad

The futures cloudy and it's raining on the poor class,
The roads to peace are closed, heavy traffic's on the war paths,
Love is balling on a budget, 
The military's says its going to need more cash
To keep fighting for your gas
Keep us in our hoods and hope we never explore pass,
Stay inside of your half, believe the lies you learn in your class,
That there's no treasure in your trash and the ceiling has the same feeling,
That the floor has, and that's where you should stay,

You're now tuned into the weakest,
Frequency of fear, keep you locked right here,
And hope you never leave this, never be a leader,
Think inside the box, and follow all procedures,
Never ever believe that, you will never need this,
Hit up all your friends and tell them to repeat this,
Hi, your on the air, now what you want to hear?
Well we ain't got the truth, but how about a remix,
Different is never good, good is only what we pick,
You ain't got a hit, unless it sounds like these did,
Not too smart you will be a superstar,
And if you dumb or something maybe you could be number one

Truth ain't getting on like shampoo on an airplane

All the hits, all the time, back-to-back on relay

Make them hear the records we play
Build your own station, become your own DJ's

I'm just trying to talk to my homie, that's up in the hole
Homegirl ain't trying to be a ho, even though she on a pole
Can she get a second chance? No!
Whoa! Like the opposite of gold
That ain't how it's supposed to be, a butterfly
For the sake of rhyming let's just say ""butterflyee""
The truth stings like Muhammad Ali
I tell 'em tell 'em don't homicide me
I just a little old hope with his back against the ropes
Fighting for his fans and, fighting for his folks

If I could block 'em out then, I could knock 'em out and
Dance around the ring, but until then I'll sing

""Doctor doctor please! The fame ain't painless enough""
That's cause you ain't famous enough
You got a little game, but your name ain't ringing enough
He said ""take two of these and put change in my cup""
I said I wasn't poor, he gave me some more
Prescribed me a publicist and pointed to the door
""Out!"" Ouch, I'm telling you this all from a therapist's couch
""Tell me about your mother? What she's all about?""
Prescribed me an interview and then told me to bounce
Damn, geez, the world is so cold, I'm glad I bought these skis
Went right off of the bunny slopes and right into the trees
Went unconscious, they rushed me to a concert
Instead of green jello and maybe chicken soup
They fed me magazine covers and video shoots

I'mma keep it cool, and I'mma do me
It is what it is and that's how it's gon' be

Evil as Knievel, I'mma jump so far
Way up in the atmosphere, I ain't coming back
Be a jerk to them jerks, yeah that'll make em hurt
Huh? said a young boy in the mirror
A young version of me, so I started to tear up
He said ""you need to cheer up, your mind need to clear up
You're already here, just be yourself from here up""
Then he disappeared and I felt something familiar
Something I was taught, something I had lost
If you are afraid of the fear that you gon' change some
All you gotta do is just remember where you came from

I'mma keep it cool, and I'mma do me
It is what it is and that's how it's gon' be

And that ain't Jersey Shore, homie that's the news
And these the same people that supposed to be telling us the truth

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said!
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
I can't take back the words I never said

Now you can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it
But if we know better than we probably deserve it
Jihad is not a holy war, wheres that in the worship?
Murdering is not Islam!
And you are not observant
And you are not a Muslim
Israel don't take my side 'cause look how far you've pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the Kush went
Complain about the liquor store but what you drinking liquor for?
Complain about the gloom but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listening to Pac ain't gone make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts, ain't gon' make it halt
If you don't become an actor you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects
Take 'em when the pains felt
Wash them down with diet soda
Killin' off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the World
Would gladly give a loan today
So if you ever miss a payment
They can take your home away

It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said!
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said, never said
I can't take back the words I never said

I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence
Fear is such a weak emotion that's why I despise it
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth
So scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even telling you
Sometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to
I'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you
Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few
My screams is finally getting free, my thoughts is finally yelling through

It's so loud inside my head

Ridin' 'round with his mama listening to the radio
And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
Doesn't know the difference between right and wrong
Now I ain't trying to make it too complex
But let's just say shorty has an undeveloped context
About the perception of women these days
His mama sings along and this what she says
""Niggas, I'm a bad bitch, and I'm that bitch
Something that's far above average""
And maybe other rhyming words like cabbage and savage
And baby carriage and other things that match it
Couple of things are happenin' here
First he's relatin' the word ""bitch"" with his mama comma
And because she's relatin' to herself, his most important source of help
And mental health, he may skew respect for dishonor

Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches) Uh, tell 'em
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
They misunderstood (I'm killin' these bitches)

Yeah, now imagine a group of little girls nine through twelve
On the internet watchin' videos listenin' to songs by themselves
It doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance
They understand the internet better than their parents
Now being the internet, the content's probably uncensored
They're young, so they're malleable and probably unmentored
A complicated combination, maybe with no relevance
Until that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference
""Bad bitches, bad bitches, bad bitches
That's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches, bad bitches""
Now let's say that they less concerned with him
And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
Ah, the plot thickens
High heels, long hair, fat booty, slim
Reality check, I'm not trippin'
They don't see a paid actress, just what makes a bad bitch

Bitch bad, woman good

Disclaimer, this rhymer, Lupe, is not usin' ""bitch"" as a lesson
But as a psychological weapon
To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
Discretion's, reflections, it's clever misdirection
'Cause, while I was rappin' they was growin' up fast
Nobody stepped in to ever slow 'em up, gasp
Sure enough, in this little world
The little boy meets one of those little girls
And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
He thinks disrespectfully, she thinks of that sexually
She got the wrong idea, he don't wanna fuck her
He think she's bad at bein' a bitch, like his mother
Momma never dressed like that, come out the house hot mess like that
Ass, titties, breasts like that, all out to impress like that
Just like that, you see the fruit of the confusion
He caught in a reality, she caught in an illusion
Bad mean good to her, she really nice and smart
But bad mean bad to him, bitch don't play your part
But bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way

They ain't never gonna change
These battle

Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruin's wooing me
Arrow holes that never close from cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid cause I know it ain't no you and me
But when you're trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know
And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding another lover's phone sends you back into the zone
With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover not a fighter on the front line with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle
Maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much
Cause I’m the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren’t the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad

Now you're down on the ground screaming medic
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses
Shields, body armours and vests
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win

I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love
I wish that I could stop 'cause it hurts so much
And I’m the only one that's trying to keep us together

Hoping wounds heal, but it never does
That's because you're at war with love

And I’m at the point of breaking
And it’s impossible to shake it

See, you hoped the wound heals, but it never does

I've tuned into my pertinence, my purposes, my goals
The feeling when you realize you've been working for your foes
And the curtains have just opened and they worthlessness exposed
You remember where you came from, where the purses was stole
There was nothing in the oven and just work up on the stove
And you blossomed from the bottom, yeah, you worked with it and rose
From nothing to a dozen and a gardener that grows

New York City way, me and Jay never left my side
Rest like that picture with your pride
Who look just like,
Now the city looks less bright
Brooklyn looking less special
Don't carry the same weight
As when you were on this level
You: work in progress from 40 projects, God bless

Ain't nobody wins like the government

Cause this is all for shares
Nobody cares
Who you think you are
And you can fight it, but there's no defence
For what things are
Baby grab a jacket
It's a cold, cold

Let me clarify the chorus
And what my cold war is
Cause the complexity is enormous
Using one of my greatest losses with eyes like faucets
To reinforce every single word that I talk with
Something about losing things, human beings
That reduces things to their most elementary
Find yourself where you never meant to be
With the energy of memories
That's the soul force of what's behind killing me
Finding pleasure in the pains
Like finding desert in the rain
Twisted: how this world can drive you masochistic
Question if I'm over it
Or if I'm numb because I'm closureless
Or my closure's that we all gotta go and shit
Rendered emotionless but moving at the speed of running over it
Still happy that I opened it

Said it's a cold cold war
Ain't nobody wins like the government
In the U.S.S.R
Cause this is all for shares
Nobody cares
Who you think you are
And you can fight it, but there's no defense
For what things are
Baby grab a jacket
It's a cold, cold

In the studio writing these words, one after another
In memorial of my brother
As you listen to the album with
Nothing on the cover
I imagine that he hovers
In the back of his chair
Floating right there in the air
Nodding his head to the music, I slightly lose it
Ask why do I put myself through this
Crack a smile, look up at the file
The waveforms on the screen of me tryna tell you what I mean
But I feel that it's all lost, or maybe that it's all gotta cross
Happy with his dedicated song
But now he's all gone
But he was never there, cause
He was everywhere, nowhere and down here
Maybe on that judgement day, rise up
We'll both open our eyes up, climb up
Hoping God forgives us for our tendencies
Wipes away our cool young histories

Said it's a cold cold war
Ain't nobody wins like the government

All over the world right? I mean, everywhere
I mean we just disappear and just come back
I feel like we can just put him anywhere

Another random thing's that consequence to me
But maybe to you, not much
But with that said, the reason behind me
Why I do what I does, love

And Morgan Frees

And to achieve it took a lot of token like Chuck E Cheese
All without touching weed

I'm just a conduit
To keep you calm through it
So you respond lucid
That means you're non-foolish
When it's gone, stupid
You think you gon' lose it
But you don't bounce, you just bond to it
Like you Sean Con or Gorilla Glue-ish
With a blonde in your palm, King Kong in your coolness,
But they still tryna knock you off the roof kid
Singing you the blues, you crayon up the music
Change it into rainbows and rubics
Keep telling yourself you the wave of the future Howard Hughes is
It's huge if you refuse to blow your fuses
You blow up, exactly how Lu did

I'm a heart donor, I'm a heart donor
'Cause everything I got, I give it all to you
My heart and my soul, I give it all to you
Cause I'm a heart donor

I hope my stories can keep you off Maury
Away from ? far from mandatory
Which means, through the mail only way you see the shorties
Keep your sons out the slums and your daughters
Out of orgies
Look in the mirror, see yourself and adore thee
Whisper in your ear, I fear nothing that's before me
And always remember that you're royalty
From the line drawn until it's Porky
And everything that's in between
Make sure you cherish every scene
And put on the biggest show your adversaries ever seen
Now even if you've never limousine'd
Important, yeah you're very there
There's red carpet everywhere

I'm a heart donor, I'm a heart donor
'Cause everything I got, I give it all to you
My heart and my soul, I give it all to you
Cause I'm a heart donor

Just know I got your back, yeah I got it, and I will go to bat
Like Gotham's under attack I will spot em, keep you from ever touching the mat
Be your Robin, bring that onomatopoeia
Down upon all your problems like ""zap! boom! bang!""
Cause all y'all my pals
I tribune through your tribulations, channel through your trials
Please God, help keep the value in my vows
A man of my words that Vanna turns around
And if your fortune turns, I never turn you down
No matter who your healthcare provider, I'm a rider
Even if I gotta bring defibrillators out
A John Q on cue just for you

Lupe Fiasco,"You shine like the lights of Las Vegas
You feel radiant and outrageous
You're confidence and appeal, so sexual
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?
How dare you come do me like that that

I got my eyes on like the fire zone
Let's be bygones
Won't you come and be a line in one of my songs?
Maybe a whole verse, baby the whole Earth my home
So let me show you around the crib
Tell you what I do, and  show you what I did
Flow is on the stove, I'm cooking for the kids
Wrist is in the freezer, heart is in the fridge
But we can warm it up, plug the Foreman up
Open the oven door, turn the saunas up
Stretch the Benz out, if it ain't long enough
Get lost in the feeling, be no longer us
Hop up out the coupe, hop up on the bus
Give you 'get to the backs', code name for Rosa's sons
We're in a better place, give us condolences
It's like a player's mate, and like a coma love

You shine like the lights of Las Vegas
You feel radiant and outrageous
You're confidence and appeal, so sexual
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?
How dare you come do me like that that

And I hope it's all up to your standards
'Cause babies really need to be pampered
I'm behind these tents like a camper
'Cause you're out there shining like chandler
Like a chandelier standing there in your radiance
I think we all need some shadiness
Or some vision care, oh no, you didn't dare
While I sitting here like Huey in his wicker chair
You know that isn't fair, how you just entered here
Getting their hopes up, that they can interfere
You're so insincere, you know I got you
Have you looked in the mirror? You know that's not cool

You shine like the lights of Las Vegas
You feel radiant and outrageous
You're confidence and appeal, so sexual
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?
How dare you come do me like that that

Let's have a cease fire, be some peace tryers
Let's negotiate, because my cheeks tired
From smiling all day
Emotions need a Motrin, a Tylenol break
I know you see my strategy, if flattery's a battery
Then I'm a rabbit with a pack of 'D's in the back of me
Pause on all levels, everybody settle
I know it sounded weird, I'm just trying to impress you
I step forward with my best two
If all that fails, open swag to the rescue
I said swag, and I'm sorry
Don't mean to offend your sensibility I meant dress smartly
Just trying to get you out this party
Can you dig that? Ologist-Archae
Please be the Ferrari to my car key
And I'ma hold my baby down like a car seat

You know what you're doing to me
You got that firepower?, baby
I just can't get enough
No, I can't get enough

Hey shawty, ain't no future in no gang-bang
And ain't no manhood in no bang-bang
Ain't no honor cleanin' interstates inside a chain-gang
Know some rap niggas put that shit inside your mainframe
Pills make you stupid and liquor do the same thing
'Raris too expensive and they way too hard to maintain
Get yourself a Camry, ""nigga said a Camry?""
Watch that ho depreciate and then you'll understand me
It's called being fiscally responsible
Don't let these lying images up in hip-hop here conquer you
The TV's not your father fool, that video's not your momma
Try your best to be a man and your worst to be a monster

Well, that's 'cause ain't shit changed, bitch
And please don't excuse my language
'Cause I would hate for you to misrepresent
The true expression of my anguish
And by this far I ain't shocked, upset, or appalled
I'm ashamed, bitch
I can't listen if you ain't sayin' shit
And recognize all this emptiness is dangerous
Ain't buildin' up they confidence, we teachin' 'em that they ain't shit
If they ain't got the latest that they saw on someone famous
Mercy of the Lord on this double-edged sword
Instead of askin' where the hoes is
Maybe maybe we could ask for roses

May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen

An Iraqi with no daddy, Palestinian throwing stones

'Cause this, the focus on this new shit is that hopeless
Place that I was born into systematic brokenness
Took that downpression and developed it to dopeness

Microphone checker all across the board you should king him
Diamond mine my mind make princesses like king cum
Every second worth of thinking
Is enough to fill three rings like Ringlings
That's how I kept it on the air is like a re-run
And kept the kings comin' in obscene sums
You see for me it's life or death like a king thumb

That's why I don't play when I relay like a team run

Used to be in awe with the pushers and the pimps own
Now I flip cars like the ribs on the Flintstones
Haters got mad and as sensitive as shinbones
Had a Goodyear and my intention is to blimp on
Even if I'm injured I'm gonna limp into the end zone
From game one to the super like Karrine dome

It's Lupe and I ain't from there

Cause I can’t find no reconciliation with your past
When there was nothing equal for my people in your math
You forced us in the ghetto and then you took our dads
The belly of the beast, these streets are demons’ abs
I’m telling you that setup in them sit-ups is so sad
The system is a slab
Corruption is the swinger sittin’ high ridin’ dirty, drag racin’ into danger
And it’s so clean, pine trees smellin’ good
With work off in the trunk and niggas in the hood
So I can’t shed blood on any battlefield of yours
I pray the ugly truth comes and shatters your decor
And as it all falls down and tatters on the floor
I shed tears, I don’t know what really matters anymore
Cause I don’t know what really matters anymore

Many things, strangest things you ever seen
Oh, look at how they swing, would you look at how they swing?
Embedded they go, no eyelids gone low
Or gone by sundown, they're dodging 5-0

Now as I wander through the city goin’ mad
I see the fruits of planting evidence instead of grass
A swindled generation with no patience, full of swag
Man, they so impatient with the stations that they have
As long as they look good when they be doin’ bad
Then the separation from the truth is gettin’ vast, fast
Be a slave at first or free at last
Double-edged choices make a nigga wanna pass
Double-headed voices from the eagle on the staff
The pyramid where eyes will split the spirited in half
Divided over money
Delighted by the dummyin’ down of the importance of crowns we’ll never have
That’s why my sounds and sermons are so full of wrath
Baptize your mind, let your brain take a bath
Swim inside the river get delivered from the craft
Of the witches in this business that be livin’ off your sad
Hatin’ on your happiness you hit ‘em off with laughs
Smile ‘til they surrender, then you kill ‘em off with glad
Hello evil, I’m back

Lupe Fiasco,"This world, my heart, my soul
Things that I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
Things I've done
My young
My unforgivable youth

With land on the horizon and passion in their eyes then
What they think are islands are much more in their size
Bountiful and plentiful and resource to provide them
Supplies slim, morale once so heavily inside them
Now steadily declining
Return is not an option as necessity denies them
With this they choose to dive in
Now along the shore and so aware of their arriving
Other children of this land prepared to share in their surviving
A pageantry of feathers stands his majesty with treasure
Not the material things of kings that could never last forever
But secrets of the spirit world and how to live in harmony together
Unbeknownst to him his head would be the first that they would sever
And stuck up on a pike up along the beach
Kept up as a warning to the rest to turn away from their beliefs
And so began it here. 
And for 500 years

Ways and means from the trade of human beings
A slave labour force provides wealth to the machine
And helps the new regime establish and expand
Using manifest destiny to siphon off the land
From native caretakers who can barely understand
""How can land be owned by another man. 
Warns one can not steal what was given as a gift. 
Is the sky owned by birds and the rivers owned by fish.""
But the lesson went unheeded, for the sake of what's not needed
You kill but do not eat it
The excessive and elitists don't repair it when they leave it
The forest's were cleared, the factories were built
And our mistakes will be repeated 
by your future generations doomed to pay for your mistreatment
Foolishness and flaws, greed and needs and disagreement
And you rushed to have the most, from the day you left your boats
You'll starve but never die. In a world of hungry ghosts

Appeared a 100 meters wide and 100 meters deep
They discover ancient cars on even older streets
And a city well preserved and most likely at its peak
A culture so advanced, and by condition of the teeth
They can tell that they was civil, not barbaric in the least
A society at peace. 
With liberty and justice for all
Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall
They would doubt that there was any starvation at all
That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved
From the sheer amount of paper, most likely used for trade
Everything's so organized. 
They had to be well behaved
Assumed they had clean energy, little to no enemies
Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies
Religions kinda complex. 
Kinda hard to figure out
And this must be the temple

Give me that late 80's early 90's old school
Feeling like my second album, so cool
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
Look shorty in the eye, told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age and if he's ever mine
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that O.G.
But it's old school, it's like '03

Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melle Mel's, Ice-T's, and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause it's hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And that's a track, and if you want it (Eh)
You have to make it like that
Now what's one turtle to a couple snails?

How can I reel-to-reel when there's Pro Tool?
I can't dig it at all because there's no tube
Fire when you speak but ain't no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If it's better with time then think in line
That you're going to be your nicest 'round your midlife crisis
If your life like Christ live your midlife like it's Christ-like
But nigga' I ain't psychic
I know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school, what's up

Give me that old school love right now
I'm leaving it all up to you darling,
Giving you everything you want

And Sebastian on the hook, like being dug by Michael Douglas

Sun positions overcome traditions
Numbers govern our young religions
Dead levels making plum decisions

Any love less than unconditional is so under Christian it's unrepentant
The physical part of my church emits the invisible arts of my work
To make gold from garbage is not the unchemical part of this map
But truth be told it's the pursuit of gold
That turns the goal of men into trash
The souls gold and they turning gold into cash

Like a finger in the back of your mouth
Cherubs and cerebellum, Tara at Sarah's wedding
Sam marrying Sam
Band pushed upon the finger of Sam's hairiest hand
If that sickens you, you a bigot
If it doesn't well then you wicked
Such is life
Odd as Egg McMuffins at night
No answers, so let us watch these dancers
Structure reformed gracefully being born
On the pallet of dark greys, concaves and spirals
Kaleidoscope into a Eiffel
It ripples then it tidals
Vacillates then it virals
Babylons then it Bibles and others
And tell me of the spinning mothers
And today's mathematics for beloved
And beasts' bellies covered like the cummerbunds of butlers

How was your day, can I make what you say
What I wanna hear, cause I want you here
The hell that we raised to the heavens do anything for
La petite mort, la petite mort

They keep the bottles just to make glass houses
Then climb up to the second floors and throw rocks out it
Then expect not a volley in reply
Some place vulnerable like prolly in the eye
What of the chicken? what is it missin', is it dry?
Did it die in some inhumane conditions so it didn't go relaxed
And attention from its demise pulled all of the flavor from the fat
And made it flat and rather lifeless
Well there's a place that has a stunning [?]
And more mercifully murdered Pisces
But barbaric are still the prices
It's rather niceless, apricot in dices and fromage slices
My son will call risotto rices
If and when he's left to his own devices, well
How is your memory?
Is it returning like a lemon tree
To bear bitter fruit of what you meant to me
Or was it slippin' like permission am I trippin' like Phil
I feel I'm grippin' but maybe the transmission
Still left out the life, also left out the will, grief
Will cheese never touch your teeth
Maybe like kosher beef
Is it real, is it real, is it real
Ha, hah!

How at the date can I make you my break
Cause I want you dear, ooh, I want you dear
The hell that we raised to the heavens make [?] for
Our petite mort, our petite mort

So glad you're back, but not glad at that you're glad
Where is the glamor in collapse?
Where in the shatter of the facts shoves one back to a pattern of stab wounds
Swoon ridden goons consumed and driven mad soon
The attended years slowly fills with baboons
That other monkey business
Where killers go free cause a junkie's a funky witness
Runny mascaras from the cunning mask wearers of death
Bygone errors, sittin' like two oil derricks
Separated by a sea of cooling num nums
Reminiscing of an every day playing hum drum
Where recognition went unnoticed
And then solidified till it was stoic
We should've been poets
Somewhere between amateurs and grandmasters of iambic pentameter

How are your chains, do they make you behave
Keep you over here, by your overseer

To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top cat chat, let's begin another yarn
That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to bach?
The ribbon in the sky is the ribbon that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings

Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
And what's the talking without the match feeling?
As buried living and cherry picking
Every linen from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother hurl
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Morrocan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
And smells like shotguns and deer piss
They on their hunt, kinda salty that I'm going hard
First part of a party, that I throw in parts
One minute you playing pool, next minute you throwing darts
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the gambit like I'm throwing cards
From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts
Paint cold pictures like nova scotia landscapes
Nerd game make mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the word play playin' at the man's states
Mean I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when the man brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weather men
And maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin'
I prefer girls to reign all over the world

And not rain like, rain man or rain like rain dance
Or rain like a slight chance of rain when it's raining
Or rein like deer slaves to santa claus sleigh man
But reign like queens that reign over made man
And not queen like queen killer, rhapsody bohemian queen
But queen like white glove wave hand
And not wave hand like it's a heat wave
So you make a fan by waving your hand
I'm talking wave like you saying ""hey""
Man, and not hay for horses and hoarse like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords like it's a fortress
And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
And especially when you're recording
Cause that's the portion that's important
When I was reporting that I was poor
But now I'm more than
It's still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
Crying shames, make margarita rims from cheap tops
Deep plots in floor, the ceiling windows for my peep pots
A little scene with the sickle swings to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words for them hummingbirds that like to eavesdrop
And fan out like peacocks with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise when the beat drops
And the sun dies when the beat stops
Then it unties, then it relocks
Then it relapsed, then it detox
Then heat back like a heat pack

Then forge poetry like a young honory morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots
Who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching nor sorbity
From the steel orbitings, sorcerer, sorcery
Coming down gorgeously, just like a stacey dash waterfall
A more torturing, a water boarding barbie doll
A river of women like a brazilian carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her, don't ever send her to mally mall's
Homie if she lonely she might end up in macauly's claws
Coming out the closet over goblets down at madri gras
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My reposition was black condition of activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they not after listens, unless it's dropping on activision
Are we apps or are we bodies filled with apparitions
Operating applications, stuck inside a apple prison
Chicken hack and download updates that lack religion

Or are we more, than soil tainting, disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and goyle chasing
And foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and watch the world through the eye holes in my oil paintings
Uh!
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it
Unless you virgin mary, nothin' do it but the truest
Believe all that unless you jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary to a clitoris
The water bearer heir of traditions that I swear to never change
My chair position or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves out the motherfuckin' forest

As I perform a nerve storm
I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures like kool-aid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration
So that's oj the juiceman meets oj with two hands
And two gloves, that's too snug
To judge who was, who drew blood

And, lupe look at all these toucans
In a cemetery full of tomahawkes
Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
Anomalies by the colonies flukes by the reservoir
Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs on the desert floor
Levitating youth so know the truth of where the fountain hides
Bucaraa roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides
A thousands parts a pound of heart an ounce of eyes
Announcing now the doubt in mouth pronounces a count of lies
Chocula counts by the counts of 5, refrigerator roof full of animals and monsters

Special research vessels made for catching whales
Fillet-a-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe hotter irons and carbon fibres that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairytale
Or maybe just a metal pail that you hit with a steel tools
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of seal school
Just like trout jumping out they house to let they gills cool
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool
I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you trying to grill gruel
Take no viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off of the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes

So I make it rain for the ladies

Of course, we ball with hoes
In the club, I golf that
But ball back, games where it rains and they halt that

Why on TV it's adorable?

Lupe Fiasco,"Oh no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

What if I said, love was a lie though
It was more like hate with a eye closed
And the other eye had the eye rolled
That's contempt and ignorance, I know
But what do I know?
Only thing that I seen was the inside of a blindfold
And you just as blind as me
So how I look? Asking you where do I go
I and I keep high hope alive though
That loves not a lie it just likes to lie low
Likes to hide right there in plain sight
And you just got to find it with your eyes, closed
And in the dark, see the part, of your partner, that's the heart
If you die it's like apartheid
We can bring it back to the

It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
No, it's not designed to make you feel love
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
Oh no, yeah

On second thought leave apartheid in the grave
But the heart part, that can be saved
The hard part's making sure it don't break into little sharp pieces that are hard to replace
Hard to find spare arteries these days
In decent shape, and know things decay
And at these rates you're gon' need to be paid
Like 3D wage just to see D. Wade
To the place that sells these parts
That you couldn't keep safe from the street art
So why would we waste our art on your mistake?
When you was driving reckless, didn't pump these brakes
Hate to have to shoot you down
A fine running heart makes a soothing sound
It's junkyard love in your future, pal
Didn't appreciate now, bet you do

It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
It's not designed to make you feel that way, now, baby (oh no)
(Yeah, yeah, make you feel)

And in the futuristic love will be reduced to physics
Computer digits made by robots
That use statistics, algorithms, and group logistics
The mood-resistant downloadable thing that's used specific
Easily updated with few commitments
Can find it's way home if you forget it
Say, maybe on a starship tour
Heard a knock at your starship door
It was the girl that you had met at the starship bar
Had a dance on the starship floor
But then you got starship sick
So you had to run to the starship store
And then you got those starship pills
But when you came back she wasn't there no more
She says, ""Hope you got a starsuit at the starship store
Maybe we can take a trip to take a look at the stars around parsec 4""
And it was the most beautiful thing you both had ever seen in your lives before
And she pulled out her love, so you reached down in your starsuit for
But your pockets empty, now the moments passing
It'll probably never happen like this again
I guess it didn't work out for you in the end

Rollin' old models, lowered old schools

Flower bearin', call it petals to the floor
Power sharin', call it devils to the door
Power, power, 'til ain't no devils anymore
Flower, flowers, they be droppin' at the feet of my son
Move a thousand miles per hour down the street of my slum
And who do I meet, to the beat of my drum
It was little Susie Uzi, she sold crack and was a killer
All bitch dope tip, wasn't trappin' with no niggas
Had a long money, minor do that action for them figures
Her influence fully automatic, crackin' off the Richter, yeah
Walked up to my ride, asked me could she get inside
She pointed at her pistol so I properly replied
Told me, out here in the streets, she ain't have no competition
And with me up on them beats, then we shared the same description
With a blunt between her lips, she said, ""Now here's my proposition:
You just write a bunch of raps for me and I'ma go and spit 'em
Then we take 'em to the radio, the DJ better spin 'em
Then we take 'em to the record store and sell a couple million""

I already got the money, already got the bitches
I see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it

Tell me call up Soundtrakk, have him send a couple beats
Not that ""Superstar"" shit, she wanted somethin' for the streets
Said it might take like a month, she said it better take a week
Gave my arm a little punch and then she pointed at her heat
Said, ""I saw that thing the first time, you don't gotta do it twice
But I need a lil' more info on exactly what I write
Some details 'bout a female, 'bout your life and what you like""
She said, ""My life is like a bitch, and I'm just like my life""
Then pow-pow-pow-pow-pow, yeah them niggas started bussin'
Like that boycott was over and that we had overcome it
She said, ""Nigga hit the gas,"" went from zero to a hunnid
Now we runnin' from some killers, I was so sick to my stomach
She was hangin' out the window with that thumper she was dumpin'
Had a look upon her face that made me think that she was cummin'
We was swervin', jumped the curb
And ditched the whip and started runnin'
Tried to jump over a wall, but it was a little tall
So we ducked behind a bush and that's how we got overlooked
I was shook and breathin' hard
And she was sittin' there smokin' kush
Then we both started to glow, we looked around like ""What is this?""
And then we looked up and a light came down
And pulled us to a ship, like, ""What the fuck?""

Well now this the shit I'm talkin' 'bout, the shit that I've been on
Yeah lightyears outer space, but still a bitch feel right at home
Now where the bitches?
Get them intergalactic asses to clappin'
Break down some of that candy and roll it up in a wrapper for a rapper
Nah I could never go back to trappin'
And who needs Atlanta when you're on Saturn gettin' a lapdance
With a lit match in your left hand, and your right hand is a gas can
And at any given moment, I could burn this shit up
Why you standin' there just lookin', nigga? Turn that shit up
Hop in some of this alien pussy, let me know how it work
I'm just sayin', I'm gon' be there and I ain't in no rush
Nah, nigga, nah nigga
I ain't in no rush

Ayy I thought you couldn't rap, when'd you learn how to do that?
Then what you need me for if you already know how to flow?
Ayy fuck that, we gotta go, wouldn't even be in this ho
If you told me from the jump we wouldn't be on this UFO
But I think that I can fly us, stole a key so I can try it
Never thought that I would ever be a flyin' saucer pilot
But first thing's gon' be first, when we get back to that earth
I'ma go back to them raps and you can go back to that work, nigga

Ayy look, the basic thing is, you can do whatever you wanna do.
Like I ain't 'bout to pass up on all this shit, you see this? 
Like we time jumpin' and shit. You wanna go back and do what, just rap? 
You can rap up here! Yeah nigga, just rap.

Lupe Fiasco,"Thank you! Uh, check, check

When you got popped up and you got locked up
And the block shot up and your girl knocked up
And your kids be like, ""Who gonna watch us?""
Your mama, they Nana
When you ball too hard or your money got spent
So you got kicked out, you ain't have no rent
But you still had a place where you could go
Tell me where you went, your mama

Soon as they let me outta jail
Went straight to my mama's house
Need someone I can talk to
And a little more time to work all these dramas out
That lawyer money, that bail money
Those letters in the mail never fail you, homie
Who visit when niggas don't visit?
Man she the realest
Boy let me tell you somethin' you better love your mama

Said I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love myself (more than I love myself)
Said I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love my health and I love my wealth
And I love my niggas and I love my bitches
And I love my car
More than I love my heart

Yeah, now some mamas might be your confidant
Some mamas just good for shoes
Some mamas might be your drinkin' buddy
Some mamas might not be cool
Some mamas might wait 'til you get home
Some mamas might come up to your school
And fuck you up in front of your friends
'Cause you don't make the rules
Really thought that you was doin' it today
Now you sittin' there lookin' all stupid in your face
When you get home just tell her you're sorry
And put on this song, start movin' to the bass
Boy cut that shit off
Goddamn, mama, they made this song for you
Said through the party and the problems
Gotta honor my mama
So that's what I'm tryna do

Said I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love myself (more than I love myself)
Said I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love my health and I love my wealth
And I love my niggas and I love my bitches
And I love my car
More than I love my heart

Now some might think their mama ain't perfect
She is
All in her face, better get in your place
You're one of her goddamn kids
Now some might think their mama ain't worth it
She is
Gotta help her out no matter what it's 'bout
No matter whatever she did

And you did it 'cause your daddy did it

Lupe Fiasco,"Uh, I just need a minute to replenish who I am
And who I am is so dependent on exactly where we stand
I stand in any pose, anything but tippy-toes
But don't want you to feel smaller, always taller
Now I'm a cheerleader, she a baller
The difference in height isn't aight, I left my ego at the alter
Now every ring's a sting and everything I taught ya
Is coming back around to me, just like revolvers
And every single click is just hammering it home
Who knew Russian roulette involved answering the phone?
Until my signal dwindles or my channel is in roam
Or my cellphone dies or it's cancer in my dome
And dear nix the tone, as I pull my fuckin’ pain out
One of your short nodes, might blow my fuckin' brains out
But you ain't even pick up
Talking to myself, exactly what you sick of

Feeling kinda restless
Did you get my message?
It's swirling around and so
No, don't tell me that you care
When I know you're standing there

Hello, would you pick up the fuckin' phone?

We were like, if a tree falls in the forest and
No one is around, does it really make a sound?
That's romantic and profound, but now
We're like lumberjacks holding the axes that brung it down
So I'm now on your message, talm 'bout ""Remember?""
Silence in return, that sound like 'Timber!""
There's some that can't see the forest because they're liars
But I can't see the forest cause of the fire
And in our prehistorics, the flowers was rooting for us
Brontosaurus ate the flowers, T-Rex ate the Brontosaurus
And then the T-Rex turned around and ate the florist
That's why I lost my FTD endorsements
But that's really not important
My sadness' a snitch, my melancholy informant
Despair wears a wire, my longing rapping a song
My worry is a rat, my lonely tapping the phone

Feeling kinda restless
Did you get my message?
It's swirling around and so
I wanna give you reasons
Tell you what I'm feeling

No, don't tell me that you care

As the rubber curly cord just absorbs all my words
Will you collect us then connect us or neglect us on the whole
Into the wall, then cross the wires on the telephone poles
Then bounces off the towers, then up into the satellites
Then falls down back to Earth to bring a broken heart back to life
Happens all the time, lost an appetite and lack of sleep
If it's dead and flatten line, I'll leave a message at the beep

Lupe Fiasco,"Peace
No material possessions shall cloud my judgement
As I reach, in an ethereal direction to provide my substance
Love is not found but resides insides me, I manifest this
I will respect myself and wear serenity as my necklace
I will replace what I take and have tranquility as my breakfast
Shed a new light on a new path
I will gain rhythm and lose wrath
Attain wisdom and refuse graph
And build upon what I built on
And wisely regulate time I do have
'Cause what is defeat?
But just the evidence of my haste
Lack of preparedness, in my waste
So I wait
Surround myself with nutrition, wholesomeness and true livin'
Use natural codes of conduct to remove the schism when the rules missing
I will pursue felicity, find value in simplicity
Altruism and empathy will be the first thing extended to my enemy
Clarity will be the trademark of my friendships
Just invest in my business
And appreciative of the rarity of my existence

I remember me fishin' out of canals in the trenches

Rolls Royce lookin' glossy
Quick to put down a demo to get these haters up off me
I like to smoke to myself
I just try to improve
Let my son hold my strap while I swim laps in the pool
Told my daughter the rules which we all must abide
Your daddy was far from perfect, things we did to survive
I just wanted to fly, they always lookin' down on us
School district full of killers, I mean these niggas ferocious
Only violence and drugs, there was nothin' for us
All I had was this music, I couldn't afford to do much

'Cause he ain't really livin' life 'less he's down to roll the dice

And a bad bitch that only think about him if he, call
Is it really worth the time and the effort?
Chasin' wood grain and the leather
Puttin' pressure on the pedal, I don't want the devil
Hopin' he fall
Feed him to his nonsense, mothafuck a contract
You don't need a handout, they gon' bring the bands out
Choppas make 'em stand down, good Lord
But you don't wanna be another nigga
Chase the figures that never really add up
White folk pass your face
Dyin' in the grass 'cause they wouldn't call the, law
'Cause you're hooded, Black and they think you're sellin' crack
Maybe so, you don't give a fuck in a rut, nigga
Ten toes in the street got you stuck, nigga, what, nigga?
Buck, buck, nigga
Buried your partner just the other day knowin' he was too young
Had a tool, tryna roll on the folk
Let it go on the folk
But he wasn't down to shoot one
Know the time dead and gone
Is YOLO what we on?

No quiero ver que las penas
Se metan en tu alma buena
Por culpa de mi querer

No quiero verte sufrir
No soy capaz de ofenderte
Si sabes que hasta la muerte
Juré ser sólo de ti

Si no encontraste ternura en mi alma
Si sólo penas te causo, yo
Me voy mi vida de tu presencia
Aunque me duela en el corazón

¡Y aunque me duela chiquita!

Yo siempre fui lo que soy
Jamás te dije mentiras
Y puse a tus pies mi vida
Sin ninguna condición

Si tú no quieres mi amor
Me voy de ti para siempre
Dejando un beso en tu frente
Como postre bendición

No habrá reproches de parte mía
Sólo me importa que seas feliz

No es nada envidiable
Ni al peor enemigo

Otra vez la misma
Esa que me llega
Hasta el corazón
El abandonado
Toquenlá de nuevo
Toquenmé diez veces

Me dice un mesero
Ya me debe mucho
Págueme señor

Ya estamos cansados
Y yo solo contesto
Háganme un favor

Tóquenme la misma
Esa que me llega

Revisar bien mis maletas

Dejar de ser niña
Para ser mujer

Entregarme a lo que creo

Y ser siempre yo sin miedo

Y ver claro en vez de oscuro
Desarraigar mis secretos

Que grita dentro de mi, mi libertad

Hoy voy a cambiar
Salir dentro de mi no ser solo corazón
Dejar y parar fracasos
Soltar los brazos y libertad que oprime mi razón
Volar libre con todos mis defectos

Para poder rescatar mis derechos
Y no cobrarle a la vida caminos y decisiones

Dividirle al tiempo y sumarle al viento
Todas las cosa que un día soñé conquistar

Porque soy mujer como cualquiera
Con dudas y soluciones
Con defectos y virtudes
Con amor y desamor
Soy como gaviota
Pero felina como una leona

Tranquila y pacificadora
Pero al mismo tiempo irreverente y revolucionaria
Feliz e infeliz
Realista y soñadora
Sumisa por condición
Más independiente por opinión

Con todas las incoherencias que nacen en mi
Fuerte, sexo débil

That is why I don't bother involving you in my world

To cherish feeling fine

Can the balance be regained?

Look out, we're in a muddle

This song is dedicated to all of you who have been 
working in the vineyard for the Lord for what seems like a lifetime
You have dreamed and you’ve worked towards 
things that you’ve wanted to accomplish for yourself
But somehow your biggest goals always seem to be just out of your reach
But the Lord told me to tell you He knows who you are
Yes, He's seen your work and He's also seen your tears
And He wants you to know that you are not forgotten
He's here to reward you for all your faithfulness
For He said in His word if you will delight yourself in Him
He will give you the desires of your heart
In other words, not only will He give you what you need
But He promised to give you whatever you want
So don't get discouraged. So don't give up
Hang in there and prepare yourself for your blessing
It's your time now

You have waited for so long
But you held on, you were strong
And for your faithfulness [5 times]
Because you hung in there when times got hard
And when it seemed like nobody cared

And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet

With those blues on parade

Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.

My heart and I agree,
Shes everything on this earth to me.

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

I think I fell in love the first time I ever saw you
And I couldn't get you off my mind
You reminded me of candy
So you be my Mary Jane

 And we can make sweet love all the time

I'd travel to the farthest star

'Cause sweeter than the sugar in a candy bar

My rocket would only stop

And all I ever think about

If you call for it, I'll deliver
I'll bring you anything
So fast it'll make you shiver

Hey, let me prove that I can love you
I'll do a dance for you
Anything that I can to get a chance to love you

You could be lost in danger with a stranger
Caught up in mystery
A one night insanity, girl

Luther Vandross,"All of the band was on time for rehearsal
And played everything just right
Then came the news telling me not to worry
The show is selling out tonight
Well, the lights went on and suddenly the crowd began to scream
And as you could well imagine, it was like living a dream
Oh, but when the lights went down and the standing ""O"" was done
I was just another lonely guy who didn't have no one

I wanted your love 
Your love, your love, love, love, love, love

So busy daydreaming 'bout you baby
I didn't even hear the phone
Then when my friends rang the doorbell it scared me
They said, ""we're so glad you're home! 
You just won a million dollars and a trip around the world?
Better get yourself and forget about that girl
They thought I was acting crazy not to get excited too
But all the money in the world could never take the place of you

All over the city the lights were so pretty
The holiday was filled with cheer
The stars really glistened and lovers were kissin'
It was the special part of the year
So what a perfect time it was to find someone to say  ""I do""
Thought that I could still be happy even though she wasn't you
We had told the world we were going to ring the wedding bell
But when I really thought about it, I was really lying to myself
",I Wanted Your Love
Luther Vandross,"Back to back and side to side
There's only music on my mind
Nothing to worry about but the beat
I wanted you to come and dance with me
But you wanted to stay home and watch TV
Ahhh, but when I got there to my surprise
There was another guy looking in your eyes

I don't want, don't want us to fuss and fight
From right now 'til tomorrow night
So if you promise to love only me and be by my side 
I'll let you slide

Without a doubt tonight is the night
That we gon' really roll when the time is right
And we're gonna carry it into the dawn
Oh, but where are you, where can you be?
I've been waiting, it seems an eternity
I took our favorite song from the record stack
It was  ""Hey, Jimmy Mack""
When are you coming back?

Well I'm so disappointed you're gone tonight
'Cause your love is the spice of my life
But if you hurry back in the mornin'
Then, alright, I'll let you slide tonight
Up and down, pacing around, walking in my sleep
'Cause you've got a promise to keep
You've got to come back
And love, love, love, love me right
And, huh, I'll let you slide tonight

I can't wait till tomorrow, baby
Can't you come over tonight?
I can't get to sleep my baby
Come and rock my cradle left to right
I tossed and turned and called you up
But there wasn't anybody home
It makes me sad, I need you bad
But I guess I'm just gonna have to wait until tomorrow comes
Slide, I knew it, I knew it.
How could you do it?
Slide, it's alright, I'll let you slide tonight
I'll let you slide
Oh, how could you do it, how could you do it?
Slide, it's alright, I'll let you slide tonight

I hired me a private eye
To check up on your cool little alibis
And what he discovered was woeful to me
Baby, if you intend to stay with me
Then you can't see the guys I know you see
Come on, let's make up and promise to start anew
Let's take the morning off, I've got some plans for you

Making love by the moon can be mighty fine
But when the sun rises, so do I
So if you rock it to me in the morning
Then alright, I'll let you slide tonight
Really missed you today, I was on the run
So wake me up when the morning comes
I think I'll dance to some music and groove on the party lights
And let you slide tonight

Get up, oooh, let's love baby
Be my sugar and spice in the mornin'
And alright, I'll let you slide tonight

Get up, oooh, let's love baby
It's really nice in the mornin'
And alright, I'll let you slide tonight

There was less than love in the things that woman said
Now, I wonder who put ideas in her head
I'm still in shock 'cause when I went back there again
She'd changed her lock and said, sorry you can't come in
What a fool I've been ...lookout
I thought I was your man and oh ooh

I wonder who's there loving you
No one does you the way I do

Luther Vandross,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Superstar/Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)

Luther Vandross,"One day I'll always remember
Was when you walked into my life
It was a very special night
When we danced so close, so tender
It gave my heart the second chance
That I'd been waiting for

All kinds of pressure has temptation calling
It gives me fever
But no matter what, I ain't gonna leave you
I'm gonna stay till the last day
Worry no more, what is love for?
I hear love knocking honey
Come on, let's open the door

You know you've got me to love
I can tell you that
If you should ever need some love
You just call me back
I've been loving you from the start
Let me tell you that
And I'll keep loving you from my heart
Sure can tell you that
You've got so much to love

Every time that we kiss
I'm reminded it's you I miss
I just love when we love like this
I can tell you that
Please forgive me if I pout
But my world would turn inside out
If on leaving me you insist
Let me tell you that

I start to hold you but you pull back, 
not much just a little
I can't control you

Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

And got so far
But in the end

But in the end

It seems like every time love comes
You're never ready
That's why they call it?
The Rush

Tell me, are you there?
Could it be that you're the answer to my prayer
See, I've prayed for peace and love
Like so many of us do
Then I prayed to find someone like you
Up in the morning
Fell out of my bed
Worn out, I couldn't sleep
Thoughts of you filled my head
How could it be?
This is scaring me

Seems every time I try
To rest my heart is when
The rush is back again
Maybe this time I'll
Make it work somehow
Guess I'm gonna find out now

I get a rush
And it's love for sure
What else can it be
Something beckons me
And I go back for more
Ooo such a rush

What else can I do
Something tells me to
Give it one more try

I'm not gonna die if love passes me by
It goes and comes around, I know
So maybe the next time I'll be one of the few
Chosen by love to do just what I wanna do
I will carry on wading through every day till love needs me
Waiting for the rush to come and find me
I still remember when love was an angel send
It will be back again

I can't remember when, I can't remember how
It's very different now
It's not a fantasy, it's very real to me
True to the touch
I get a rush
",The Rush
Luther Vandross,"For love you pay the price
You give it up, you sacrifice
And if necessary you comprimise
Sometimes it's bitter sweet
You've got to try eight days a week
To create a good enough love to keep
You see hearts belong to fire
So does her love
She burns me up with desire

My girl's love is right on time
""Sweet"" and ""sweet and ever kind""
She's so fine
She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind
Even when I come home late at night
We don't fuss, we never fight
'Cause the girl loves me to the line
She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind

It was out of my hands
I did my best, please understand
I was late for one of our evening plans
Champagne, dinner for two
With candlelight, she set the mood
But there wasn't anything I could do

But, she is so forgiving
The one thing I know is
It's off her love I'm living

That girl's love is right on time
""Sweeter than sweet"" and ""ever kind""
She's so fine
She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind
Even when I come home late at night
 We don't fuss, we never fight
'Cause the girl loves me to the line
 She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind

When I go out to play
She doesn't mind if I'm a little bit late
She knows I think about her face
Till I get home
Till I get back home
What we gonna do tonight?
It's raining heavy and it's cold outside
So let's just love until we get things right
And waste a whole lotta time
I don't mind

I tell her things she can't repeat
Makes her little heart just skip a beat
She blush a little bit
And then I find
She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind

Even though our love is  ""C'est Si Bon""
Sometimes I like to be alone
Ring the girl on her private line
She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind

Go to work early, come back late
Outta my head, can't concentrate
Sometimes my love is a waste of time but
She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind

She's better even than she used to be
Loving her is no mystery
Sometimes I'm not so sweet and kind
She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind

When I call her in the middle of the day
She's busy at work, but it's okay
But not too busy to give me time
She doesn't, she doesn't
She don't mind
",She Doesn't Mind
Luther Vandross,"I am still your friend 
Standing by to catch you 
If ever life should let you down 
And you should fall. 
You don't need to pretend 
If ever doubt should find you. 
I don't need to remind you 
I'm there for you before and after all. 
I am who I am 
And I would never fool you. 
I feel the same way you do 
About honesty. 
But do we understand 
How love is sometimes jaded? 
It keeps us separated 
Even though we'll never part.  
So to be lovers 
We've got to understand 
Today is how today begins, 
Tomorrow's how it ends. 
And to be lovers 
Some things we rise above. 
'Cause sometimes love is wonderful 
But sometimes it's only love. 
Loving who I am 
Is something that you've taught me. 
The kind of love you've brought me 
Takes me through the day. 
And even though our minds 
Are sometimes disagreeing 
Our hearts they're still believing 
We'll work it out and stay. 
So to be lovers 
We've got to understand

Tomorrow's how it ends.

Luther Vandross,"Ready or not
You're gonna get a taste of love
Just like you want it to
Your wish is gonna come to you

So, if you've got a change of heart
Stop that before you start
None of this holding back
I thought you knew that

You can't be doin' that now
Stop it right away
You can't be doin' that now
'Cause I need a little kindness
A little, a little tenderness
A little love somehow

Other loves you've had
Are just a thing of the past
All a part of yesterday
Forever and far away

But, never will I disappear  
My love is gonna stay right here
So, none of this pulling back
I thought you knew that

What's it about, my love, my love
What's on your mind, now baby love
Answer my call, I'm callin'

Maybe today, things can change, nothing stays the same
Maybe today, is for the love we need, I really believe
Through it all, come what may
Little miracles happen everyday
 
What is a miracle?
Love is a miracle
Every time that you care, a miracle, it happens somewhere
So many miracles, even small little miracles
Just take one look about, it's not hard to figure out
'Cause it might be today, anything can change nothing stays the same
And maybe today, what's tomorrow for, no one know for sure

We're feeling the same way we always did

So, here we go once again
It's just like back when
I clearly remember the way we were then
So come back and love me again

I was the one who adored you
And I waited all this time for you
But, you can't tell love what to do
It's so hard but it's true
You used to love me completely
And I'd really love you to need me
So darling, tell me you can find the way
Find a way to love me, again

I've heard the stories of hearts that get broken
But, if we take it slowly, it won't have to be
One step at a time heart, too fast and it all'll fall apart
I know we're survivors, but I'll speak for me

Even as strong as I am
I don't think I can
Lost outside the world
I don't know just where I stand
So hurry back girl, and love the boy again

Now, you've got plans to change, some things to rearrange
Scared of tomorrow, scared of right now too
See, it's all very sad
Can't deny you feel bad
But I just don't want you to let this thing take you over
 
Don't let it hurt so bad, don't let it because?
Everything can be the way that it was
But keep hurt inside and it's just like those tears of the clown
Everyone says that you'll come back around
But, not if you fall too far down

No one really knows
When their clouds will go away
That's why they say we should always save
For a rainy day

Someone made some promises that didn't keep
It set you up just to let you down
Be careful not to let it push you around
And you'll be okay, if you take one day, by one day
See, I just don't want you to
Let this thing take you over

Don't let it hurt so bad, don't let it because?
Most of your life can be the way that it was
But, keep hurt inside and it's just like those tears of the clown
Everyone thinks that you'll come back around
But, not if you fall too far down

Too far down is where you fall when you don't care no more
But, what about love?
Isn't it worth living for?
You don't know?

Don't let it hurt so bad, don't let it because?
Everything can be the way that it was
But keep hurt inside and it's just like those tears of the clown
Everyone says that you'll come back around
But, not if you fall too far down

You're not the only one who's loved and who's lost
So many people too, know they've paid the cost
The thing that we learn is how to get a smile from a frown
Go ahead if you want, stumble and fall
But, don't fall honey too far down

Pick yourself up; if you're lost you'll be found
But, if you don't care, you're just too far down
I know you feel so left out; pushed around
But nevertheless, don't go too far down

And in the morning when I kiss her eyes
She takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
She holds me close and won't let go

Everyday a beginning
Sprits rise and their dance go unrehearsed
They warm and excite us

Oh baby, baby
Don't be a link in his chain
Tell him you want to be free, you want to love me
Don't let him get in the way

For every one time that he gives you pleasure 
Ten times he makes you wanna cry
You spend every night with the toss and the turn, baby
And wonder why in the world, oh why
How in the world can you get any sleep
Every one knows the way that he creeps
It's time for the question baby
What has he done for you lately, no

Whenever you want me to
I can make it better
I just need this one chance to prove it to you 
I can make it better
Ooo baby, baby
Don't be a pawn in his game
Go 'head and tell him it's over, tell him to go
Or darling, it's just a shame

Better for you is better for me
Let's fall in love, I'll make you see
Better for you is better for me, baby
Let's fall in love, I'll make you, I'll make you see

Never again will you hear a lie
Never again will you wanna cry
never, oh no, will there be a tear drop in your eye
Stop all this madness in the name of love
Tell him to leave ?cuz enough is enough
Let him go baby, save your love for me
Tell him you've found somebody
Who'll give you the love that you just won't believe

Disappoint me and I cry
So they're words I don't always say, but
It's in my love, it's in my feeling

It's just hard for me to say why
Kinda sad, kinda blue
Because I wanted to tell you
That you were in my heart
Though we were far apart
Didn't know how to say
All the little things to make you stay
And not to keep assuming
You could read my mind

If I wanted to be your man
You tell me that you feel lonely
But you won't love nobody
You tell me that you got a big heart

But you won't let nobody in to love
What am I gonna do?
Hey there baby, you're not shy
We talk for hours and you seem just fine girl, but...
Every time I bring up love
You run for cover
Suppose I told you something that's true
Suppose I told you that I want you
You tell me all the guys want you
But you won't love nobody
You keep your heart in seclusion
And you won't love no one

This time I know that it's love 'til the end

And, this time I'm right; this time I know it's love
Ain't no love like she gives
And she told me that I'm the reason she lives
Comes to me all the time
I'm not just making her up in my mind
I see the stars in her eyes
And I look and I know that she sees only mine
All of my life I've been waiting for this

Stayed longer than I planned

So I rearranged my world for them
For her and love and, here I go again

Said, ""Open up wide""
Then got the message you had changed your mind
And now here I am and I just don't understand
Baby, if you talk to me then I will listen
There can't be no ""us"" honey, if ""you"" are missin'

You don't understand me, I know that you think...
I don't love you, I don't need you

Whether or not the world gets better
You and I and love will be together, together
Whether or not the world gets better

There's so much beauty and yet there's so much pain
And we'd be wiser to make a change, with love we could
It's our world, we should make it good
And if the world outside gets too cold and feels too lonely
And it gets real bad
It'll still make us sad

But I don't anymore, she said I'm a bore

My heart hit the floor (don't be a fool anymore)
Each time around
I tell myself it's the game of love
Ignore the signs and risk it all in the name of love
Well, I've decided I can't let nobody hurt me again
So I'll say to the end
I just don't wanna be a fool (don't want to be a fool)

He's caught in the game
It all ends up the same (he doesn't feel the shame)
He looks at love in a diff'rent way
It breaks his heart ev'rytime they all turn out strange

But he'll never change (he's never gonna change)
Next time around I'll tell myself it'll be better than before

There's not a thing for you that I wouldn't do
But, yesterday was rough on me
I was under the weather
So my dear, I didn't have much to say

And I rushed you off of the phone last night
So I called you back to apologize
But your line stayed busy through the night, you see
And it makes me wonder
Are you mad at me?

I was right to fall in love this way
And one thing's for sure
The angels smiled on me 
When you came my way
So my dear, tonight's the night
It's gonna be special
I can't wait to see the face of my love

But even though I tried, sorry I was late
And I understand that you couldn't wait
But you're pulling back, honey I can see
And it makes me worry
Are you mad at me?

I wish I could be perfect for you
Can't you see how hard I try?

When you talk to me I can hear the pain
When I look in your face I can see the strain
And I can hear the cries of the willow tree

Too live to drive so we put it in park
With Luther hoping that you feeling his groove
Get you open on the instruments too, one two, one two
And I say, jottin' down the lines
Like dots on the Parkway
My Auntie Eloise say stay on your Q's and P's
And until the days of D's, I'm doin' what I please
Ease on down like the road
Depending on the mood, definitely into more
And you can catch a yellow brick
You need to run and tell your click
That the female in town is bringing it

Shake, rattle and roll, to rock wit' chu

I like to reminisce about that night we kissed
It was somewhere one night in Harlem
The nights were hot and bright
You could treat your honey right
?Cause Sylvia's would burn all night

The people there were really something
(You know that's right)
The music always kept us jumping
And it used to knock me down
When Smokey came to town
(And the miracles, please)
My favorite song was ""Tears Of A Clown"", oh yeah

There ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem
They really shake the funk up there
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem
And I'm gonna take my baby back
To the heart of Harlem

Big sister had a group 
And they'd sit out on the stoop
And Lordy could they harmonize (Oh yeah)
My cousin Joe could blow
Just like the radio
And he used to drove them ""B"" girls wild

But when grandma started happy dancing
(Oh, she gon' break somethin')

The Apollo is where I had to go with my crew
From BMW's to my daddy's Cadillac
He had the sunroof top wit the diamond in the back
Check the ambiance, the place a renaissance
Who frontin' nonchalant up in the restaurant
What you really really want, we grabbin' by the clutch
Precise can flaunt with this and never too much
It's such a love flow, high but natural
The thug's a no-show, and drugs a no-no
The only thing that they was shootin' was pool
While Harlem nights was right, the party was cool

Let it out, say it now
Say it

Luther Vandross,"How could I forget what she had on
Halter top with the capri pants on
Had a smile that would stop time
And pretty feet which is a fetish of mine
Hair down to her shoulders barely
Lip gloss with no make-up surely
I wasn't gonna let her get away
Until she heard me say

Excuse me miss
What's your name
Where are you from 
And I come and possibly 
Can I take you out tonight
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home before it's dark 
So let me know 
Can I take you out tonight

Don't care if I get rejected
At least then I won't regret it
Regret the fact I missed the chance 
For romance at least
I walk away knowing I tried my best 
And I'm going, I'm going on with my day
Cause at least she heard me say

Excuse me miss
What's your name
Where are you from 
And I come and possibly 
Can I take you out tonight
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home before it's dark 
So let me know 
Can I take you out tonight

Excuse me miss
What's your name
Where are you from 
And I come and possibly 
Can I take you out tonight
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home before it's dark 
So let me know 
Can I take you out tonight

That's why I had to come over
And introduce myself to you
Cause you never gonna know 
When you're gonna find love
And hopefully I'll find it in you

Excuse me miss
What's your name
Where are you from 
And I come and possibly 
Can I take you out tonight
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home before it's dark

Luther Vandross,"Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby, I love you, I really do

Long ago and oh so far away
I fell in love with you before the second show
And your guitar, it sounds so sweet and clear
But you're not really here
It's just the radio

Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby, I love you, I really do

You look for me, but you'd be gone
you want my love but you're on the road
Don't you remember me anymore?

Loneliness is a such a sad affair, sad affair
And I can hardly wait to be with you again

And what to say, to say, to make you come again, oh honey
Come back to me again
I wanna be, I wanna be anywhere you are

Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Baby, baby, baby, oh, baby, yes I love you, I really do

When are you gonna say ""it's alright, it's alright, ooh baby""
""It's alright, it's alright, oh right now""

Luther Vandross,"Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me 
And then
Spin me around 'till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me 
And I knew for sure 
I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk
Another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love love love 
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother 
Would disagree
To get my way I would run 
From her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
yeah yeah
Then finally make me do 
Just what my mama said
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he 
Would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step 
One final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
Cause I'd love love love to 
Dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how mama would cry for him
I'd pray for her even more than me
I'd pray for her even more than me

I know I'm praying for much to much
But could you send her 
The only man she loved
I know you don't do it usually
But Dear Lord

Luther Vandross,"Your love's never been better
So good it's a sin
But it's time for a decision
Is it me or him?
Before you make your mind up, hear me
I just want you to see things clearly
This should be about love, not money
Don't let him try to take you from me
I don't want to have to apologize
I don't want to feel I've been penalized
Just 'cause I can drive in a better car 
Live in a bigger house just like a superstar
He says that I can only give you
Material things, but that's not true
You see my heart is rich with love for you
Don't let him make you doubt my love for you
Yeah, baby
I work hard for my money
No one gave it to me
But some fools think the deeper the pocket
The smaller the heart will be, not true
I'm only tryin' to share me with you
Look at all the lovin' we do
Find the meaning in the words I'm sayin'
I'm not just another player playin'
I don't want to have to apologize (or give a damn)
And I don't appreciate being criticized (for who I am) 
Just 'cause I can buy you a lotta things
Or take you anyplace
That's just what money brings
He wants you to believe that I'm tryin' to buy your love
'Cause that's what he would do
He thinks since he's a man with nothing
That he's got better love for you
No way 
Tell him now, let him go
Or I can no longer be yours
Tell him how you feel about me
I can't keep standing on the side
Don't let him fill your mind with lies about me
Leave him with his fallacies
I don't care what bull he believes
Tell him that enough is enough
Just don't return a disbeliever
You've always been a willing receiver of my love
I don't think I have to apologize (I work for this)
I don't want to feel like I'm penalized (for being rich)
Doesn't bother me where he thinks I stand
I'm bein' my true self
Just doin' what I can
He thinks I won you with materiality
But honey, you know that's not so
And even if he understood me
It's simply time for him to go, so let him go!
I don't want to change you 
'Cause I'm in love with who you are
So I don't want to apologize for bein' a superstar
Haven't I proved that I'm here for you?
What am I guilty of?
What did or didn't I do?
Maybe I can't be myself with somebody
Who believes such things are true
I'm losing self-respect from trying
I'm losing my desire too I can't do it
I don't want to have to apologize (or give a damn) 
I don't want to feel I've been penalized (for who I am) 
Just 'cause I can buy you a lotta things
Or take you anyplace
That's just what money brings
He wants you to believe that I'm tryin' to buy your love
'Cause that's what he would do",Apologize
Luther Vandross,"He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
But it tears her apart 'cause nothing's for her heart
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss goodnight
If he could only read her mind, she'd say,

Buy me a rose
Call me from work
Open a door for me what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things
I need the most in my life

Yeah

Now the days have grown
To years of feeling all alone
As she sits and wonders if all she's doin' is wrong
Cos lately she'd try anything just to turn his head
Would it make a difference if she'd say, if she'd say

Buy me a rose
Call me from work
Open the door for me what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things
I need the most in my life

And the more that he lives
The less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside
And the more that she gives
The more that he sees
This is the story of you
And me

So I bought you a rose
On the way home from work
To open the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hoped you noticed this look in my eyes
Cause im gonna make things right
For the rest of your life(rest of your life)
And I'm gonna hold you tonight, tonight
Do all those little things
For the rest of your life",Buy Me a Rose

Luther Vandross,"Well by now you know I'm insatiable
""Cause when you step to leave I want a full repeat, yeah
It's a miracle, you were right inside my head
If the feeling's nice, why not do it twice?
It is not against the law, no baby
I slave all through the week 
And I need my release
I work hard so when I stop 
I gotta get a little satisfaction for me
Hit it again
Don't care if I'm late
The world just has to wait
Hit it again, hit it again, baby
Hit it again
I loved it the first time
Sent chills up through my spine
Hit it again, hit it again, baby
Deep emotion ain't got nothing to do with it
And being in love ain't really got a thing to do with it
I hope you understand
But I can't worry if you don't, oh no
If I can't double up
It's like I didn't get enough
Call me greedy if you want, just do it
But it's something that will never change
I don't get no complaints
They know it when they ring my bell
That this could be a thing that could take a little while, well, well
Hit it again
Don't care if I'm late
The world just has to wait
Hit it again, hit it again, baby 
Hit it again
I loved it the first time
Sent chills up through my spine
Hit it again, hit it again, baby 
I declare the point to be 
Once is not enough for me 
Two time lovin' makes me smile
One time love just ain't my style
Repeat the love and I have found
More the second time around
It builds me up I love to love
And if I can't hit it again
It ain't natural 
Hit it again
Don't care if I'm late

Luther Vandross,"I think sometimes I can read your mind
When you make things up I can tell you lie 
I see the things that your man can't see
And I wonder what kind of man is he
The one who you say is your lover 
Who you insist takes care of you under the covers
And who is there for you and loves you like no other 
Then you kiss and tell me that you love me like a brother

[Chorus]
If I didn't know better
I'd think that you were mine, you're with me all the time 
If I didn't know better 
I'd swear we're more than friends, you're touching me again 
If I didn't know better 
I'd think we were in love 
Girl, do you want to tell me something
Oh, oh, oh
I could be wrong about the things you say 
But I don't rub up on my friends that way
You tell me that you've always been a flirt 
But if it goes wrong, I could get hurt
But no, you insist it's harmless playin'
It's just a part of who you are, that it's just your nature 
And that it's fine 
You know I'm a friend, it's really nothing
You say that I'm just like a
That I'm just like a brother

[Chorus]

My idea of a friend is when you
Do a lotta things together and have a lotta fun 
But my definition of love is different
You touch and hold each other 
And you only want to be alone clinging to each other 
Like you and he should be, but like you and I are
Well, I know it sounds crazy but

Luther Vandross,"[Foxy Brown]
Yes, dutty
It's ya girl Fox Brown and I'm comin' through ya town
Know what I mean, but for Luther I'ma keep this clean, yes (oh)

[Verse One: Luther Vandross (Foxy)]
Could've died when I found out we
Couldn't live together peacefully 
That's when it started and we nearly parted
Well I was hoping not to see that day
We started getting in each other's way 
Maybe it's better, we don't live together

Things got strange, my space to chill became half the size 
You became, someone I didn't even recognise (what)

[Chorus: Luther (Foxy)]
What's the matter now? (y'know)
What you talkin' bout?
If it ain't one thing, it's another (that's right)
If it ain't one thing, it's the other (whatever)
Why you gotta put me down?
What you complaining about?
If it ain't one thing, it's the other
If it ain't one thing, it's another (Dutty)

Oh, oh (what) oh, oh, oh, I remember
{And I was like that when you left me}

[Verse Two: Luther (Foxy)]
I remember when, I got a yacht for a dinner cruise
The way you treated everyone was rude
And I don't believe ya, you're such a diva (that's right)
I told the waitress we wanted wine {uh huh}
You got upset because the girl was fine 
You're complicated (you know), but somehow we make it

I get tired, from all I have to do to keep you satisfied
Get no sleep, you call me in the middle of the night and weep

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Luther] {Foxy}
I guess I can't see the wool through you're eyes {yes, uh}
(Pretty little brown eyes) {yes}
I guess I don't understand what goes on, goes on, goes on {LV, baby!}
In your mind

[Foxy Brown]
Now Luther what you mean if it ain't one thing, then it's another
Look brother, we took a vow to cherish each other
And I, been through the storm
But you keep disrespecting and ignoring me
I swear, won't be long til I'm gone
But, ain't nothing worse than a black woman scorned
I move with integrity, it's hard being a celebrity
And loving you is like a Gift and a Curse
You ain't gotta think twice, 'cause I'm leaving you first (uh huh)

[Chorus: x2]

[Foxy]
I must admit that at times I talk slick
But I'm the woman of this house, my best defense is my mouth
And, I give you good love, I cook you dinner 
And like Halle and Denzel, your wife is a winner
So on, you chose your bed so sleep in it
I should've known from day one, but I was so deep in it, so
Since what I'm saying, is going in one ear and out the other brother
This ain't your house, get the hell out!
And leave the keys and the drop top Z behind
You can't diss me, then expect to keep what's mine
So keep thinking you can use and abuse me
While you realize you miss me, I'm gone, taking my ish with me",If It Ain't One Thing
Luther Vandross,"When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something strange without a warning, love

And the world is all right with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When somebody else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Luther Vandross,"We shared a life, we shared a heart
But what we united seems to be breaking apart
It's a haunting pain, goes right to the core
Now we're dividing what's mine from what's yours

I'll keep the same old things I had when we met 
And you'll keep what's yours ?cause that would only be fair
But what about the heart that we both created together?

[Chorus]
We used to be the toast of the town
We used to have the best love of all
We had blue skies but they came falling down
What happened to us

You and I once were lovers
No cheating hearts and no one did wrong
So why did we break, can't say our love wasn't strong
But I know with time things that start to mend

So let's fix these hearts so they can't be broken again
You need a man who sees how lonely you've been
don't worry, I will start all over and then
We will get back the heart that we both created together 

[CHORUS]

Last night I cried but girl you were not here
So it was just a big waste of tears
But then I smiled, I heard your voice in my ear
Tellin' me you wish it could be like it was in the beginning

[Chorus]",Once Were Lovers
Luther Vandross,"If you always do what you've always done, you'll always get the same old stuff
Life can treat you good, then turn as cold as ice
And believe me when I tell you

This thing called love, for sure, is like most things in life
Not all bad, not all good (it's just something that I believe)
Not all cold, not all hot (yeah, I like that)
Not all bitter, not all sweet (sounds all right to me)

So don't miss all the good, waiting for the best, there's still happiness
Right in the middle
Perfect love sounds real nice
But that never seemed to happen with any relationship of mine
It was always up and down, in then out
And after the last goodbye, I still didn't know what it was all about
You get disappointed if it ain't bliss all the time

And you get so annoyed if you can't feel the same every night
Not all bad, not all good (I'm tryin' to tell you that it's)
Not all high, not all low (not all high and not all low)
Not all heaven, not all hell (as far as I can tell)

It's not some prize you win, you don't have a thing to prove, just enjoy the groove
Right in the middle
Cause I've learned when it comes to love, it's the exact same reality
That's why they say ""Que sera, sera""
Which means whatever's gonna be is gonna be

Whatever's gonna be is gonna be:
Not all bad, not all good (I need somebody to understand)
Not all sunshine, not all rain
(You know that too much of a good thing is really no good)
Not all laughter, not all tears (I'm only trying to tell you)

To let your good times roll, keep your self-control, there's a lot of soul
Right in the middle",Right in the Middle

You messed up you shoulda warned me first (she saw you)
I'm sad to tell ya
You shoulda told me 'cause you made it worse (she saw you) unlucky fella

You better hope with all you got (she saw you)

Saw you kiss the very girl (who's supposed to be) only your friend
She's convinced you took her heart 
And played with it like a toy
And from what I heard, you just might need you a lawyer
It's too late for feeling bad, you did not respect the girl
You tried to play around
And got caught with your pants down
You can't escape from what you've done (she saw you) your time is up
You're like a deer who's caught up in (she saw you) the headlights of love
You can't be too proud to plead (she saw you) she's gonna make you pay
Forgiveness is what you need (she saw you) she's too mad to let you get away
Looks bad to me
You were busy trying to be a player

Well, I was talkin' to some of your friends
Just to see how everyone was doin'

Said it was something you'd never admit

But I'll keep being strong

You say that you're strong
You say that you don't need anyone

They said you needed me

I know the people talk just for the thrill
But the fact of the matter is still
They said you needed me

You'll feel better, you'll feel stronger

Luther Vandross,"So close to paradise, but closer than I should be
It's like I'm along for the ride, it happened unexpectedly
Promised myself that I wouldn't ever love again

I was riding on the train (I thought about you)
Feeling high like I seem to do
Every time I think about you 
Saw two lovers start to kiss (I thought about you)
Had to hold back the tears (I thought about you)
Other girls no more exist
All because I think about you
Nothing seems to help, I don't even know myself
I'm trying not to think of you, but a heart does what it wants to do
Pass you by, see you smile and I must admit I get
So emotional, I think I'm falling for you
Bought a pillow for my room (I thought about you)
Heard Alicia sing a tune (I thought about you)
It sends my rocket to the moon
Every time I think about you
Right from this heart of mine (I thought about you)
I wanted you every time (I thought about you)
What I feel is so divine
And it's all because I think about you
But I'm constantly reminded
Reminded that you're only someone who I'd like to know
You don't know me, you're my private fantasy
You're with me, constantly in my mind
Had a lovely day today (I thought about you)
Wasn't hard to get through (I thought about you)
Seems to happen easily

Luther Vandross,"I thought sometime alone
Was what we really needed
You said this time would hurt more than it helps
But I couldn't see that
I thought it was the end
Of a beautiful story
And so I left the one I loved at home to be alone(alone)
And I tried to find 
Out if this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Whoo-oo-oo-oo yeah

And then I met someone
And thought she could replace you
We got a long just fine
We wasted time because she was not you
We had a lot of fun
Though we knew we were faking
Love was not impressed with our connection they were all lies, all lies
So I'm here cause I found this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you

I knew she was the one who could change my mind

And good times were my toy for joy
That was all I was thinking of
But I gave it up when I fell in love
I used to know the party people around the world
I gave it up when I found that girl
And she's the one treats me good enough
So I gave it up when  I fell in love

To only see the world through my eyes
And that it was a waste of time
Talkin' 'bout love
But it only took a little time
To make me change my mind

Luther Vandross,"One thing I would love to do is talk to someone, wish I knew who
Sometimes the people who know the least say the most
Makes you wonder who you can trust, what's gonna happen
 
First thing I know, God is love
The next thing would be, He loves me
Sometimes I'm tired of waiting for a thing or someone
Then I stop and see what He's done and I know everything will come
 
Maybe today, anything can change, nothing stays the same
Maybe today, what's tomorrow for, no one knows for sure
Through it all, come what may
Little miracles happen everyday
 
And so there you go, strangely enough
Alone even though, addicted to love
You're in and out so quickly that it gives you a start
You're waiting for a message or a word but you haven't heard from your heart
 
Maybe today, things can change, nothing stays the same
Maybe today, is for the love we need, I really believe
Through it all, come what may
Little miracles happen everyday
 
What is a miracle?
Love is a miracle
Every time that you care, a miracle, it happens somewhere
So many miracles, even small little miracles
Just take one look about, it's not hard to figure out
'Cause it might be today, anything can change nothing stays the same
And maybe today, what's tomorrow for, no one know for sure
Through it all, come what may

Luther Vandross,"After the dance I walked my baby home under the moonlight
It was a scene, right from my fantasy
She said the things that made me wanna say
How much I love her
(Don't love no other)
It couldn't be, ooh, she's so good to me

And when the morning came around
Well, she had not let me down, she was still my lover
I must confess that I put her to the test
To see if there was any others

She proved to me, oh, what a real good love she'd be
And she was so excited
Deep in her eyes was a promise of the love
That I've been dreaming of
She made me love the world, well
So I know she's my girl

I'm on the cloud where no one is allowed except my lady
High as can be, she's so good to me
Well, I don't care or know what the people down below
Think 'bout my baby, maybe I'm crazy
But it's ecstasy, yeah, she's so good to me

She's so very fine
(And I love her and I love her)
She's the one I see
(Yes, I love her, yes, I love her)
Well, I do know day and night
No one else could be so right
She's so good to me

She's my fantasy

She's so truly good to me

My lady love and I always have a real good time
Just the three of us
We never stop, till the hands up on the clock
Say the night is up

We see the sun and then the fun has just begun
'Cause it's a brand new day, yeah
I hurry through of the things I've got to do
And then I'm on the way, yeah
Back together love, I've been day dreaming of

I don't agree, they say that every love has got to change
How can it be? She's so good to me
Now, they say that suddenly, she'll start to acting strange
(She's gonna change)
No, not my baby, she's so good to me

She's so very fine
(And I love her and I love her)

I was sure up to now that she was a friend
I stayed 'till the end (don't be a fool again)
I once believed that love was fair

My heart hit the floor (don't be a fool anymore)

I tell myself it's the game of love
Ignore the signs and risk it all in the name of love

I just don't wanna be a fool (don't want to be a fool)
Said I don't wanna be a fool ever again

Whenever a fool's in love he doesn't know he's to blame
He's caught in the game
It all ends up the same (he doesn't feel the shame)
He looks at love in a diff'rent way
It breaks his heart ev'rytime they all turn out strange

But he'll never change (he's never gonna change)
Next time around I'll tell myself it'll be better than before
I won't look back
There'll be no one tearing my heart out anymore
I just decided I can't let nobody fool me again
So I'll swear to the end

Luther Vandross,"Knowing love the way I do
I can say for certain that it's true
There's a chance for me and you
I surely feel like the time is near
The picture in my mind is very clear
I think love has brought us here

I remember not too long ago
I was just a lonely person with a lonely heart
And I was hopin' there could one day be
Be a chance for me to

Get the love that I'd been missin'
Sometimes love takes a long time
Wait for love and you're gonna get the chance to love
Wait for love, wait for love, oh my

When you take the chance on love you see
It's not a waste of time if you truly believe
The impossible can be
So hold on tight if you think you're right
'Cause nothing hurts as bad as when you see
You gave up too easily

I remember spending all my time
On a dream that kept me wishing that you could be mine
And I was hopin' there could one day be
Be a chance for me to

Get the love that I'd been missin'
Sometimes love takes a long time
Wait for love and you're gonna get the chance to love
Wait for love, wait for love, oh my

I never stopped believing there could one day
Be a chance for me to

Get the love that I'd been missin'
Sometimes love takes a long time
Wait for love and you're gonna get your chance to love
Wait for love, wait for love

And you get the love that you've been missin'
Sometimes love takes a long time
Wait for love and you're gonna get your chance to love
Wait for love, wait for love

And you get the love that I'd been missin'
Sometimes love, it takes a long time
But wait for love and you're gonna get your chance to love
Wait for love, wait for love

And you get the love that I'd been missin'
Sometimes love, it takes a long time
But wait for love and you're gonna get your chance to love
Wait for love, wait for love

And you get the love
Sometimes love, it takes a long time
But wait for love and you're gonna get your chance to love
Wait for love, wait for love

And you get the love that I'd been missin'
Sometimes love, it takes a long time
But wait for love and you're gonna get the chance to love
Wait for love, wait for love

And you get the love that I'd been missin'
Sometimes love, it takes a long time

Was what we really needed
You said this time would hurt more than it helps

I thought it was the end
Of a beautiful story
And so I left the one I loved at home to be alone(alone)
And I tried to find 

Out if this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Whoo-oo-oo-oo yeah

And then I met someone
And thought she could replace you
We got a long just fine
We wasted time because she was not you

We had a lot of fun
Though we knew we were faking
Love was not impressed with our connection they were all lies, all lies
So I'm here cause I found this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you

In the midst of a fierce competition
Get a view from a better position
A little closer, now you got my attention
Maybe your my, my, my superstar

Don't believe I can fight temptation

If you're nothing, don't get jealous, just keep moving on
Feet to the beat, so hot the heat, spraying off the shine
So cling, so fresh, a real good kiss, so I'm gonna make you mine

Here it is

She caught me by surprised I must say
Cause I never had seen such a pretty face
With such a warm and beautiful smile
It wasn't hard for me to notice her style
I was fascinated surely
She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say

Excuse me miss
But what's your name?
Where are you from and can I come?
And possibly can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home before it's dark
So let me know, can I take you out tonight?

Don't care if I get rejected
At least then I won't regret it
Regret the fact I missed the chance for romance
At least I'll walk away knowing
I tried my best and I'm going
Cause at least she heard me say
I'm going on with my day
Cause at least she heard me say

Excuse me miss
But what's your name?
Where are you from and can I come?
And possibly can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home before it's dark

And introduce myself to you
Cause you never know where you're gonna find love
And hopefully I found it in you, yeah

Your loosing what your were fighting for
Why don't you just shut up, but you keep on You ""don't even care"",

Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?

For a lead role in a cage?

Can you look me in the eye and tell me that you're still upset?

Well, you can't kick me out while I'm still reeling
I just want to get what I haven't had in so long
So long

I take you places where they kiss just to say ""hi"" to you
And break your heart open just like a shell
Because right now I'm so afraid of tomorrow
And some things I don't wanna do with anyone else

Like when I kiss on the lips, I was being European

My hours are slumber less
Dearest the shadows
I live with are numberless
Little white flowers
Will never awaken you

Of sorrow has taken you

Of ever returning you
Would they be angry
If I thought of joining you?

With shadows I spend it all
My heart and I
Have decided to end it all

And prayers that are said I know
But let them not weep
Let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream
For in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul
I'll be blessing you

Tread like broken tramps, damp on stone cold stares &
Deep within the fear of a hundred lonely victims down

The moon separates the seas
From you and me and sleep

Like a neck in my heard and hard goes tumbling down
We go downtown to the river flow
Near the bloodshed in the soulyard you and me,
Tonight we can gather up all the dust and spirits wail,
Fling them into flimsy walls
And fall, then we can burn down love's lonely furnace,
Watch as it smolders and we expire.",Friday Afternoon

I done been broke
I done been talked about something awful
Done been lied on by so many folks
I done even been depressed at times
And didn't want to cry cause my pride was too strong
But over the years I thought it over
And after struggling for so long and still holding on
I figured, can't be nothing all that wrong with crying
If anybody says that they're that strong they're lying
See crying is like taking you soul to the Laundromat
It's like the feelings that you get
When you see your Grand-mama smile
Or the heavens open up and blessing rain down
Go on child and cry
Go on child and cry, cry, cry
We can cry together

See I done been a player
I done been played
I done been went for the some of the oldest tricks
From some of the coldest chicks God done ever made
Said I done even had a venereal disease
And didn't want to go to the clinic, all that attention embarrassing me
But over the years I've learned to understand
That I don't really give a damn what nobody say, I'm a man and we cry

I ain't got that kinda dough
Like it's my fault that she got on welfare
I told her we can go half on the similac and the daycare
But no, she got comfortable at the bottom and wanted to stay there
And I don't know how this gonna turn out so ya'll keep me in your prayers

And I don't think it's funny that she plays the innocent mother

And it destroys what we've been blessed with

It's probably because you don't have album one
So if you don't have album one, go get it
And if you already got album number one, go get it
And if you already have album number one, go get it again

Ha, we now return to our program previously recorded
Already in progress

",Intro
Lyfe Jennings,"This ones for my people locked up
Know we keep you in our prayers
And ain't forgot about you out here
No
Call me whenever you feel
'Cause I know a lot of folks don't keep it real
I know they got their own life but still
When you love someone you let them know
You don't let them go
It's hard enough being alone
Missing your family missing your home
Whether you're right or wrong I'll be by your side
Keeping your hope alive
I know how it feels to cry
So you ain't alone in your struggle for life
To my people 

Hold up, Lets do this right
First blaze one for all my fellas that ain't here with us tonight
Hold up, lets do this right
First blaze one for all my fellas that ain't here with us tonight
Some of them for life 

Your kids doing just fine
The youngest, reminds me of you all the time
He even shoots that ugly jumper from the foul line like you do
And your girl she doin ok
But don't concern yourself with if she will or won't wait
You'll just drive yourself crazy with stuff you can't change
There's better ways to occupy your time
Like opening up your mind
It's a troubling time out here
Your kids need your guidance even from in there
And no matter when or where I won't abandon you
'Cause that ain't what friends do
Still got a lot of love
And I pray to God through my actions you'll know how much 

To all my people who ain't coming home at all
There's many children who could learn from your experience
Have a heart get involved
And for all my people who gonna see the streets one more time
You got another chance at life
Count your blessings everynight

Hold up, Lets do this right
First blaze one for all my fellas that ain't here with us tonight
Hold up, lets do this right
First blaze one for all my fellas that ain't here with us tonight

Lyfe Jennings,"Lord they really think they fooling you by coming to church on Sunday
Praying and laying hands on folks stomping and jumping around faking the holy ghost
But its a thin line between walking it and talking it
Living it and giving it or just pretending it's alright
And did they really think that they could pull the wool over your eyes lord
Did they really think that by faking they were saved that they would get the same reward
This be the realest thing I ever wrote for sure
After this a lot of folks won't like me no mo'
But after this I gotta go answer to you Lord
So I've made up my mind I'm a go to church on Sunday
And sing a song that may hurt somebody's feelings so that maybe
Thy will, will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
And hopefully they will see
How much they really be discouraging a little old sinner like me 

And Lord who they think they jiving by singing these songs full of glory
Then out in the world it's a different story
I'm running out of people to pray for me
I'm not trying to act like I'm the perfect man
But if you speak about it, you should be about it not just preach about it all day
Cause if you do you run the risk of chasing some of the most beautiful people away
And it is never my intention to discourage you rather encourage you to change your life today
This be the realest thing I ever had to say, but after this a lot of folks won't like me no mo'
But after this I gotta go answer to you Lord
So I've made up my mind I'm a go to church on Sunday
And sing a song that may hurt somebody's feelings so that maybe thy will, will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
And hopefully they will see
How much they really be discouraging a little old sinner like me",Made Up My Mind
Lyfe Jennings,"Must be nice
Having someone who understands the life you live
Must be nice
Having someone whose slow to take and quick to give
Must be nice
Having someone who sticks around when the rough times get thick
Someone whose smile is bright enough to make the projects feel like a mansion
Must be nice
Having someone who loves you despite your faults
Must be nice
Having someone who talks the talk but also walks the walk
Must be nice
Having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too
Someone who loves you for sho'
You just remember to never let 'em go

'Cause even when your hustling days are gone
She'll be by your side still holding on
Even when those twenties stop spinning
And all those gold-digging women disappear
She'll still be here

Must be nice
Having someone you can come home to from a long day of work
Must be nice
Having someone you don't have to show; they know exactly where it hurts
Must be nice
Having someone who trusts you despite what they've heard
Someone as mighty as a lion but still as gentle as a bluebird
Must be nice
Having someone you don't have to tell you don't want to be alone
Must be nice
Having someone you can grow old with until God calls y'all home
Must be nice
Having someone who understands that a thug has feelings too
Someone who loves you for sho'
You just remember to never let 'em go

'Cause even when your hustling days are gone
She'll be by your side still holding on
Even when those twenties stop spinning
And all those gold-digging women disappear
She'll still be here

'Cause even when your hustling days are gone
She'll be by your side still holding on
Even when those twenties stop spinning
And all those gold-digging women disappear

She'll be by your side still holding on
Even when those twenties stop spinning

Lyfe Jennings,"See I done been discriminated against
Talked about by my friends
Played a fool by women
And had a daddy with no feelings
I lived in ghettos with my momma
Used the stove to heat our water
And had to share clothes with my brothers
Three of us one bed one cover oh

And those were the happiest days of my lyfe
If it ain't rough it ain't right
Street lights are coming on
Better get home, better get home
Those were the happiest days of my lyfe
If it ain't rough it ain't right
While we're reminiscing Christopher Reeves
You're still Superman to me 

See I done been mistreated and discouraged
Felt like I was worthless
Lonely scared and nervous
In a world without no purpose
Cried out to God I didn't deserve this
But he said in time I would
See it's the bad times that make the good times feel so good 

Yo I done changed dirty diapers
Cooked food with lighters
Shot so much game chicks nicknamed me sniper
Famous ghostwriter
Bank account retired
Too many zeros
Poppy still illegal
Chain look like nickels mixed with icicles
Stretching from the neck area to the genitals
I got a parrot on my shoulder that talk for me
And he don't say shit but nigga back off of me
Yea I'm a hood nigga
But I'm still a good nigga
Bought a couple kids new bikes, Just cause I could nigga
And I ain't one who be lookin for thanks
I just ball cause I like the Yanks",My Life
Lyfe Jennings,"I know a lot of women gonna hate it
But, somebody's gotta say it
And so I nominated myself to deliver the news
That its hard for a man to choose a lady
That already got a baby
Although his feelings may be strong
Having kids that don't belong to him
Holding on to him somehow seems wrong to him
Exposing them to a man who may one day decide
He's tired of the family life
And now he's gotta tell that little girl a goodbye lie
When he's the only Dad she's ever had in her life
I don't want to take that chance please don't take offense
It's just the thought of hurting somebody that was innocent

She got kids
And I don't know if I'm ready to give
Them the things that they need to live
'Cause if we become more than just friends what I do for her I gotta do for them kids
She got kids
And I just want to make sure this is
More than just some sexual trip
See all I want to do is prevent those kids from getting hurt again

Most men think it but they'll never say it
But what if ya'll had another baby
And he's accused of choosing favorites, and they're right
Would he be wrong for loving his own flesh and blood a little more
Is he being human or only being immature
Who's to say
That's why it's better just to wait
Take love day to day
And let love spread its own wings
And if it wants to fly away or if it decides to stay
It won't be because of any unrealistic expectations ya'll done made
And he won't have to pray that little girl ain't awake
When he tiptoe out the door so he won't have to explain
I don't want to take that chance please don't take offense
I just don't need that kinda drama on my conscience
Ohhh ooooo

She got kids
And I don't know if I'm ready to give
Them the things that they need to live
'Cause if we become more than just friends what I do for her I gotta do for them kids
She got kids
And I just want to make sure this is
More than just some sexual trip
See all I want to do is prevent those kids from getting hurt again

She got kids
And I don't know if I'm ready to give
Them the things that they need to live
'Cause if we become more than just friends what I do for her I gotta do for them kids
She got kids
And I just want to make sure this is
More than just some sexual trip
See all I want to do is prevent those kids from getting hurt again",She Got Kids
Lyfe Jennings,"Feels like I'm in heaven
Rollin' my 67
Cadillac DeVille
Bumpin' that old Sugar Hill
Today I'm living proof
Your worst fear came true
I'm doing alright without you baby
I'm leaving all that darkness behind me
Making changes in my life
So when that sunshine finally finds me
I can stand fully in the light
Spread my wings and reach for sky
I never felt so alive
Kiss my kids goodnight
Tell 'em Daddy's alright I'm alright 

Honey child there's a whole world waiting on you
Took a while but we finally made it through
Go 'head you can smile now all that darkness' behind you
Smile. Smile. Smile. 

Feels like I've been baptized
Almost drowned but I survived
She held me under for 5
Years of my life
But today I'm living proof
Your worst fear came true
I'm doing alright without you baby yes I am
I'm leaving all those grudges behind me
Throwing fear out the window
So when these blessings come to find me
They will have room to breathe and grow
Let my blessings overflow and get my life under control
So my kids will know, Daddy finally let go
I finally let go

Blue skies- blue skies are calling you
No more teary eyes- no more crying for you baby
And I don't despise you at all
I thank you for the lessons you have taught me

Honey child there's a whole world waiting on you
Took a while but we finally made it through
Go 'head you can smile now all that darkness' behind you
Smile. Smile. Smile.",Smile

Rolling in my 2-door Monte Carlo
Looking for somebody I can borrow
5 or 10 dollars 'til tomorrow
I'm doing bad ya'll uh-uhn
I just smoked my last pack of cigarettes today
Ever seen a nigga diggin in the ashtray
It's a crumbling and humbling sight to see
I'm doing bad ya'll uh-uhn
And their teasin' me with these 23's and these dvds in their ride
And they pass me by-by-by-by-by-by
And have the nerve to wonder why

[Chorus:]
I be robbin' these niggas
I'm a stick-up kid
That's how I live I admit it
I be robbin' these niggas
I'm a stick-up kid
And if you're doing too much I'm coming to get it

See lately I've been thinking bout saving my soul
And do prayers make it to heaven from the ghetto
I asked all my friends but they all say they don't know
It's all bad ya'll
And the preacher talking bout some stuff he don't know
When church done became a fuckin' fashion show
And they won't let a nigga in with these timbos
It's all bad ya'll

Lyfe Jennings,"What if I broke our monogamous agreement
What if I told you I lied but didn't mean it
What if my one mistake
Had the potential to break
Up our happy home
Would you want to know
What if I confessed it and though she didn't mean nothing since it happened
You're thinking about leaving
What if I suppressed it
And made a vow to never mess with another
Is it cool for me to smother the facts
Is it cool for me to cover my tracks
If you'd never know
Or would me not being honest hurt you more 

Hypothetically of course
Are there some things better left unsaid
Or would you want to know instead
Hypothetically of course
Are there some wars not worth fighting
Some tears not worth crying
Hypothetically of course
What if this happened to you
What would you want me to do 

Well what if I told you that I had a confession
What if I said 4 years ago when we were arguing
He came to comfort me and I wound up pregnant
And I just can't say for sure
If the baby's yours
What if I confessed it and it turns out not to be your baby after you get tested
And it destroys what we've been blessed with
What if I suppress it 'cause technically you're the baby's daddy anyway
Is it wrong for me to want you to stay
Would you rather have me tear you away
From the only family you know
Or is this just too big a secret to keep it on the low 

Hypothetically of course
Are there some things better left unsaid
Or would you want to know instead
Hypothetically of course
Are there some wars not worth fighting
Some tears not worth crying
Hypothetically of course
What if this happened to you
What would you want me to do 

Would you want to know
Would you want to know
Tell me what you'd do
Would you walk away or would you stay
Would you want to know
Would you want to leave the past behind us
Or are you afraid that one day it might find us

Could it even matter
Should it even matter",Hypothetically (Featuring Erin)
Lyfe Jennings,"First off I got to send a shout out to Brooklyn
Be K in the building stand up, second of all
Man, I tell you when I do these interviews out here, man
All these cats always asking me

Who do I mostly resemble in the music game?
So I think to my self, why? Who could I have said
I mostly resemble in this game and one name keep on circulating
Through my brain man, none other y'all know him as Biggie nigga

From a place where them niggas don't talk a lot
License suspended so we walk a lot
Always been a thug, since I was a young cat
Brisked up like Godzilla, mix my similac with Cognac, oh

Now I can't even pray no more
'Cause I done did so much dirt, and smoked so much Dro
I'm afraid God'll be like what you callin' here for
Don't be dialing my line asking me for shit no more

Whoa, it's Biggie nigga
Record me as a City nigga
Yeah, it's Biggie nigga
Record me as a City nigga

I done seen church boys get killed like that
Roll off at the mouth when they ain't built like that
So for all you wanna be's out there whose attitude is shitty
Yeah, God don't like ugly but he ain't too fond of pretty neither

I'm a hustla from the top of my door rag to the bottom
Of my timb's that done left prints on many backs
Like 50 said, ?These in the street niggas they ain't playin'
And if y'all don't like what I'm sayin', y'all gon' have to murder me again?

Record me as a City nigga
Whoa, it's Biggie nigga

You Biggie, for all these cats out here doin' something positive
In your community you Biggie, for all these rap cats

Lyfe Jennings,"Lord, it's a constant struggle down here
Specially when all you know how to do is hustle down here
Lord, it's a miracle, I'm still breathing down here
Lord, it's a battle field down here

Lord, it's easy to get killed down here
So I keep my family near me down here
And keep my bulletproof vest on
Thank you, Lord, for making Teflon down here

'Cause the ghetto has a way of manipulating the children
Tricking them into believing that life has no meaning
Down here, down here

Lord, if you see my grandmother up there
Tell her I know she's disappointed in me
Hates to see me in and out of jail
But tell her life ain't as heavenly here as it is up there

I know it's probably lovely up there
But tell her I ain't in no rush to get up there
So I keep my pistols off safety
At all cost I gotta protect and feed these babies

Lately it's been hell
Keeping my black ass from coming up there
So I'm thankful every day and pray my enemies
Don't roll down on me and send me kicking and screaming up there

To my peoples trying to make it from down here
To my peoples who done made it up there
To my peoples trying to make it to up there

It's your boy Ghetto Superman
A.k.a Lyfe, a.k.a don't got a wife
What up Young Boy?

Everybody talkin' about livin' on Capital Hill
We livin' on the hill, ya know?
Talkin' about the front row, front row?
We livin' on death row

We grew up in the gutter
Eatin' peanut butter sandwiches with no jam
We looked up to the hustlers on the corner
Throat sore from screamin', ""Get your money man""

Had dreams of movin' on up to the big leagues
Like George, Weezy and Florence
But it's kinda hard when police is havin' you killed
Resurrected, rearrested for old bench warrants

Yeah, it's a struggle man, but we handle it the best we can
Only difference between folks that's free and folks in jail
Is some of us got caught on our way to Heaven
Takin' the shortcut through Hell

Ghetto Superman, faster than a speeding Cadillac
Able to leap tall buildings
When police is on your back, yeah
It's a bird, it's a plane, no

It's Ghetto Superman, talk slick as Republicans
Sold almost as much dope as Uncle Sam
Your friendly neighborhood Superman

If you played on my playground
You'd be used to hearin', ""Stay down, they shootin'""
Lost my daddy in a shoot out, chest all blew out
Another family ruined

Had dreams of findin' a good job
So he wouldn't have to rob niggas, I'm a stick up kid
Finally get what we deserved
Instead of havin' to take what they give us

Yeah, it's a struggle man but we takin' it
One bullet at a time
But it's kinda hard to get that monkey off your back
While that monkey still on your mind, on your mind

Superman, faster than a speeding Cadillac
Able to leap tall buildings
When police is on your back, yeah
It's a bird, it's a plane, no

It's Ghetto Superman, talk slick as Republicans
Sold almost as much dope as Uncle Sam

Lyfe Jennings,"Yeah, a lot a mysteries, a lot a histories
Too much blowin' up and showin' up, and not enough growin' up
I mean it happens, people change, yeah
A brother changes everyday but ah, most of all we changed

Sometimes makin' up is easier than breakin' up
We believe if we just fake it enough
We can trick ourselves into believing
That we're still in love

But in our hearts we know that it's inevitable
Though it's hard to let you go I know I must
Sometimes memories just ain't enough
Sometimes you out grow the ones you love

Sometimes it's none of the above
It's just a fact that people change

No one's to blame
There ain't nothing that stays the same
So we sit around an cry because neither one of us
Wants to be the first to say goodbye

Sometimes giving second chances is easier than dealing with the fact
That once the trust is gone you can never get it back
But you're holding on because you're afraid of being alone
So here you are holding on to something that's already gone

And don't act like it's the first time you've heard it in this song
'Cause your heart done told you all along
If your momma done showed you right from wrong
Nothing should hold you down this long

There's no one to blame
Nothing stays the same
So we sit around an cry because neither one of us
Wants to be the first to say goodbye, bye, my love, oh

So let me be first to say goodbye
",Goodbye
Lyfe Jennings,"Never miss a good thing 'til it's gone
I never meant to hurt you girl I was wrong
I always knew that one day you'd move on with your life
But I guess in the back of my mind
I thought you would come home one more time
I heard it through the grapevine you got a man
They say he treats you good and he makes you laugh
I'm happy for you baby and I ain't mad at you
May all your kids do good in school
And may all your dreams come true

I'll always love you
I'll always care
And girl you gotta know that
I'll always love you girl
And no matter where you are
Know that my love is never far

A happy woman is worth her weight in gold
Loneliness is good for the soul
Expensive places, lovely faces come and go
But you only find your soul mate once
And if you miss your chance you'll never find it again
I can't complain I did this to myself
You needed me and I wasn't there to help
It breaks my heart to see you lovin' someone else
I would give anything I own
If I could just have my baby home

Lyfe Jennings,"Little somethin' for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corinne

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothas clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin' don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas ya up, I just call em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy (what's that)
When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up

Keep ya head up, ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter

Keep ya head up, ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter

Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me
He had me feelin' like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for tha pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin wet up
You know it's funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
It ain't no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up

Keep ya head up, ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter

And uh
To all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to kno' why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears, is rollin' down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin' things don't all down this week
Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older and cold
From havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to my survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but
Please, you got to keep your head up",Keep Ya Head Up

I'm to blame
And I can't sympathize with your pain
If I could I'd make it go away
But I can't
So I concentrate on more realistic things
Like questioning
Is there anything here worth salvaging?

[Bridge]
Is it over?
How do we go about deciding?
Do we add up all the good times then divide them
By how many times we hurt each other
Or do we just ignore the numbers and vow right now to never ever take asunder?

[Chorus]
Let's stay together
Can we agree to just disagree?
Let's stay together
Don't do it for the kids, do it for me
Let's stay together
I'm tired of all this making up and breaking up
Let's stay together (together)
Let's stay together, yeah

Girl, I can't justify what I've done
Ain't got no reasons why, not even one
I pray to God what seems like every morning for the sun
To shine on us just one more time
And let me hold you in my arms, and we'd just cry

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

(Aight' you wanna make me say it, you wanna make me say it)
See, if you leave
(I would not die physically)
But emotionally
(Might as well bury me)
For I can't be the man I should have been
Before all of this happened
But if we hold on
(And ask God for direction)
Where we went wrong
(We can make the correction if we)
Just stay strong
All of our up and downs
Fully come around
And there will be nothing that can shake us
Nothing that can break us
We will stay together

[Chorus]

(Put your hands together, man)

This is where it all comes to a head at
Are all these years worth nothing?
Is it over?
You don't wanna be with him
He don't wanna be with you
Hell, you done made some mistakes too
He done made some mistakes 
You done made some mistakes before, man
Work it out, man
And you dudes out there
Anybody can be slick at talking
Anybody can be slick at talking, man
Try to be slick at listening, man
Your work is at home
It ain't in the streets, it's at home
So get there, get there
And stay there",Let's Stay Together
Lyfe Jennings,"Ohh 
Lord thank you, thank you baby
Ohh

Lovely as the summer time
Always been a friend of mine
Slicker than banana peels,cooler than three pair of high heels
You'll always be the highlight of my life yeah
Love you like I love my fellas on the block
More valuable than coca-cola stock
Oh if I had my way this love will never stop
You're the only thing that matters oh since I lost my pops

More than a girl more than a friend
Some one I can depend on till the end 
Most folks talk about me cause they don't see what we see
It's the difference between hating and loving me

Wonderful like a newborn babies smile
Amazing like being baptized in the Nile
Put me in impress me wine do that to me one more time
You will always be the highlight of my life
More alive than Biggie and Pac
Stronger than a pair of grandaddy's old socks
Oh if I had my way this love would never stop
Don't ever worry bout me leavin'
Cause I'm satisfied with what I got

More than a girl more than a friend

Lyfe Jennings,"I remember shoot outs over necklaces
Little Debbie breaksfasts
Growing up in the projects, life stinks
Drinking fifths of Hennessey to forget my misery
Struggling out here in these streets
Barely living in this world
And this world is just so hateful

[Chorus]
It's just so hateful
The kids are so ungrateful
And I'm no longer able to disguise my disgust
And I know they're saying
We should trust the Lord will come and help us
And maybe I'm just being selfish but I've had enough
But when my song comes on the radio
I forget all my troubles
And for one moment I'm not there at all
No matter where in my life I am that's my jam
Said when my song comes on the radio
I forget all of my troubles
And for one moment I'm not there

I remember fighting with my babysitter
Life without no father figure
Searching for my daddy's killer, life stinks
Working jobs that I don't like
Cussing out God every night
For giving me this awful life
And it don't stop cause this world

[Chorus]

Yo I done been in a lot of street fights
Got a hood stripes but I ain't immune to pain
Whether you are seventeen, black, white, gay, straight, or a lesbian
We all go through the same thing on one level or another
You never had a dad, had a part time mother
You had a good girl but you was too gutter
Mommy got a man now but you still love her
Some things just fall apart like some words break your heart
Even if you don't admit it sometimes in the back of your mind
You really want to fall down and cry and never get up
But you gotta get up cause you gotta pay bills even though you feel like a loser
But you ain't a loser you God's child and can't nothing move ya
But when my song comes on the radio
I forget all of my troubles
For one moment I'm not there at all
No matter where in my life I am
That's my jam, that's my jam
When my song comes on the radio

Lyfe Jennings,"I was born by the river
That my momma cried when my daddy died 
Maybe that was the reason I didn't get the attention 
That I was needing to touch 'cause
I reminded her of him too much 
Couldn't understand what she felt so I hated her, yeah
Til I was old enough to hate myself
And I felt like a slave down in South Carolina
Cursing the vagina that gave life to me
I couldn't see what I had the potential to be 
Til I got down on my knees and begged God
To please take control of my life today

[Chorus]
Cause there's no way
There's no way,no way,no way
I can do it on my own
And no matter how my friends try to console
They can never never know
What I go through
So I turn my heart over completely
To you,yes Lord, I do

I was born in a hurry
Cause my momma had to be back to work at 8:30
Maybe that was the reason there was always this feeling
That she was rushing herself
She didn't even have the time to spend loving herself
Let alone,someone else
So I hated her,yea
Cause I loved her,yea
And I cried,yea
Like the Klu Klux Klan at the Million Man March
Partially broke my spirit,partially broke my heart
I couldn't start to be what I had the potential to be 
Til I got down on my knees and begged God to please
Take control of my life today

Lyfe Jennings,"Hey yo, you
You see most cats would take advantage of you right now
But I ain't gon' do that, you heard
I'm a give you the game, right
I'm a give it to you because
I don't want somebody to give my little girl the game
So she could find her S.E.X.

Life's a trip
Heard you just turned seventeen and finally got some hips
Hustlers on the block go crazy when you lick your lips
But they just want relations, they don't want relationships
(Welcome to the real world)
It ain't the same
Fellas old enough to be your daddy know your name
Everybody's talkin' 'bout how much that girl done changed
Can't quite put your finger on it, but you feel it's strange
Like it's fire in your veins

Girl, it's just your S.E.X.
Mama's secret
And daddy gon' go crazy when he finds out that his baby's found her
S.E.X., take a deep breath
And think before you let it go

The block is packed
Baby got an attitude and proud to holla back
Mama's giving advice, but she ain't tryin' to hear that
Not because it's wrong, just her delivery is whack
(Shay, get your butt in this house, if I see you with another boy, I swear...)
Life is rough
You say that you're not ready for sex, but you're in love
He says if you really loved him, you would give it up
Mama says that's just a line guys use to get your stuff
Which one will you trust?

Girl, it's just your S.E.X.
Mama's secret
And daddy gon' go crazy when he finds out that his baby's found her
S.E.X., take a deep breath
And think before you let it go

Hey yo, Lyfe
She might take it better coming from a woman (Get 'em, girl)
See, he'll tell you all kind of things to get in your pants, yeah
Baby, it's a fact that once it's gone, you'll never get it back (never get it back)
Hold on to your innocence
Use your common sense (you're worth waiting for)
Be strong
Honey, don't give in, blessings come with patience
Till we meet again, I'm praying for you

Girl, it's just your S.E.X.
Mama's secret
And daddy gon' go crazy when he finds out that his baby's found her
S.E.X., take a deep breath

What you mad for?
I don't know too many that go to sleep in Chanel and wake up in Fendi
You know what it was before you hopped inside my Bentley
And everything was good as long as I kept spending
But I'm gonna keep it hood, see you I can do without it
You wonder why we call you bitch, think about it
Go holler at your man, maybe he can support ya
Love don't live here , I ain't got nothin' for ya

First things first girl stick that attitude in your purse
Straighten up your face before I pull over
Ain't nothing cute about walkin' home from work
Check yourself
Now number two

A brother taught himself how to ride a bike
But once I got the hang of it I rode all night
I said that to say
This relationship is gonna have it's good and bad days
It's like fallin' off and getting back on again
But no poppin' wheelies til we got our balance
I can't handle this

What up with all these allegations
Shorty all is well
Accusations about my situation, callin' my cell
Take a step back, relax, chill, pause exhale
You're the reason I ain't got no bars on my cell
You must think I'm in this booth spittin' these bars for my health
For every action there's a reaction , cause and effect
Good times and bad 
Times and bad times, whatever cards are dealt
You need some help 'cause I

Some people have heard of him as a hustler
Hell, hope live, really

Street life killed my daddy
Got my momma pregnant in the back of a caddy
Since I lost my first tooth, I ain't been happy
Young wild nigga child, why that boy is so nappy?

He got that devil in I'm police wanna take him down
Used to be a player but the Coochie cost money now
He ain't to bright but he know a trap when he see one
Got is conscious in his pants with his gun

Seventeen years of rain foggin' up my windows, yeah
It done been seventeen years of pain but I'm still here though
Seventeen years of rain foggin' up my windows, yeah
It done been seventeen years of pain but I'm still here though

Shoe box full of pictures
All that's left of good times I've shared with my niggas
Some alive and some no longer with us
How da, how da, how da hell do you pray for forgiveness?

When you got devil in you
Rogain keeps the hair strong but cocaine keeps the cable on
I can't wait till my nigga JB come home
Why do all the real niggas stay gone so long?

Seventeen years of rain foggin' up my windows, yeah
It done been seventeen years of pain but I'm still here though
Seventeen years of rain foggin' up my windows, yeah
It done been seventeen years of pain but I'm still here though

Even though a nigga still in the hood, gettin' drunk and smokin' on wood
I'ma make it up out of this street life on the corner is where I stood
Out there all by myself 'cause a player gotta get this mil
Wearin' fur ain't doin' us no good flippin' burgers ain't gon' make you filled

But I'm still ten toes in this hustlin' tryna make hood rich
And I still ain't trustin' no bitch 'cause the mother fuckers always snitch
It's hard in this ghetto man fifteen years old with coke and cane
Cheese don't come I'ma go insane snatch me a purse, snatch me a chain

Out here on the block with the fiends and the moon
Squeeze on the glock tryna pop at a goon
He done stole my dough, he took my food
Project wasn't born with a silver spoon

In my mouth, in my grill wear six chain then niggas get killed
One in the grave the other in jail, nobody wins that's fo' real
Back way when I was a runny nose runnin' round up and down
The town carrying a black glock and a gold frown

I kept that product on me, it wasn't no problem homie
You said it, I had it and met you if you stole my money
Just tryna buy bologna but now I'm buying lobster
Still totin' a glock but pushing a Rolls Royce and winning Oscars

Yeah, 365 Mafia, Project Pat, Lyfe Jennings
If you can believe, you can achieve every damn bug
'Round us a good day, yeah

How eager your panties be to get put on

With no wangs, it's a bird, (it's a bird) it's a plane, (it's a plane) short shorty
It's the hero song everybody sing along.
You are my hero (hero), you don't need a costume everybody knows your name,
The greatest hero (hero) you can make me feel good even when your miles away.
You are my hero (hero) you can make the sun shine even when the sky is gray,
The greatest hero (hero) one kiss from your lips and all my troubles fly away.

Wolverine can't cheer me up when I'm sad, (sad)
Captain America can't slow dance, (dance)
Hulk can't make a boy feel like a man (man)

I still believe in breastfeeding babies and looking both ways before you cross the street.

I still believe in magic and rainbows.
I still believe in family, the laws of gravity, and where there's a will there's a way.

Rebuilding family, make this world a better place, I still believe.

Lyfe Jennings,"She been gone, almost two weeks now
Tired as hell, but I can't sleep now
I miss my kids, and though I see them everyday it ain't the same
This big house is full of echos
I'm thinkin now maybe I should just let it go
'Cause it's too big for just me
Too many memories

[Chorus]
So I pay my child support like the judge tells me to
And I'll stay out all night drinkin' while I'm getting over you
It's sad but it's true
Don't know what else I can do
Guess I'll pull my fuckin' heart out on this CD like a fool
Yall better learn from this
Mmm

I day-dream of how we used to be
And eat ice cream until the box is clean
I miss my kids and even though they live right up the street
It's killing me
My phone rings for what seems like hours
And when they ask for you, I say you're in the shower
It's my way of calming down
It's either that or burn this fuckin' house to the ground

[Chorus]
So I pay my child support like the judge tells me to
And I'll stay out all night drinkin' while I'm getting over you
It's sad but it's true
But I'm gonna do the best I can
And if by chance I don't make it, the kids tuition is in my timberlands
Y'all better learn from this
Mmm

So I guess I'll take it to the bridge (to the bridge)
Cause there's just too many and this is what it is
It's about a man who lost his woman and his kids (and his kids)
And it goes a little something like this (goes a little something like this)
Little miss muffet sat on her tuffet, eating her porridge away
Then along came a liar
Sat down beside her and frightened miss muffet away
Again now she's gone
She ain't never come home at all
Ooh now she's gone (learn from this)
If I could take it back
Ooh I would take it, ooh I would take it (learn from this)

She the type of woman you can't do no better than
You say you got game, but you sitting on the bench again
Now you're asking ""How?"", you must be an Indian

Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful
Loving you from your head down to your cuticle

Lyfe Jennings,"Young man, thirteen, running the streets
Living his dreams of being Nino Brown,
And a grandmother, who pleaded the 5th
A baby brother, who needed him
His little sister, believed in him
He needs to slow down
Then what happened next is something we see on a movie screen
Then his days as a nigga came to an end
Police found him in a pool of blood, clinging onto life
That boy looked up and he said/

Tell mama, I'm sorry, I was wrong (I was wrong yeah)
Tell mommy, I'm sorry, I was wrong

Young girl, sixteen, running
The same streets, living her dream of being Foxy Brown
And her teacher who, tested her
And an uncle who, molested her
Heavenly father still, blessing her
She just chose to play around
Then, the pain was just too much
Then, we are just living today and dying tomorrow
Said a prayer,
Then closed her eyes
Nodded slowly, then said wait God before I go
Tell my mama that I'm

Tell mama, I'm sorry, I was wrong (I was wrong yeah)
Tell mommy, I'm sorry, I was wrong

Somethings you can change
Somethings you can't
Somethings will never be the same

She going in like a scuba diver
Hot like a forest fire, sexy like you wouldn't believe
She say she wouldn't do me bad. I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad.
It would be my pleasure girl to sweat out your weave.

Lyfe Jennings,"Alright alright alright
Y'all settle down settle down settle down.

If you don't know where you are
This is statistics 101
And I'm your teacher
Lyfe Jennings in the flesh baby.

Books out.
Let's go!

Twenty five percent of all men are unstable
Twenty five percent of all men can't be faithful
Twenty percent of them don't mean what they say
And ten percent of the remaining twenty is gay

That leaves you a ten percent chance of ever finding your mate
That means you better pay attention to these words that I say
I'm gonna teach you how expose the ninety percent
And show you what to do to keep the other ten.

Rule number one
Don't be a booty call
If he don't respect you girl he gon' forget you girl

Rule number two
If he's in a relationship
If he will cheat on her that means he will cheat on you

Rule number three
Tell him that you're celibate
And if he wants some of your goodies he gon' have to work for it

Rule number four
Be the person you wanna find
Don't be a nickel out here lookin' for a dime

Statistics!

Fifteen percent of all men got a complex
Fifteen percent of all men don't practice safe sex
Twenty percent of them come from homes without a father
And there's a fifty-fifty chance that you'll marry a coward

Something to think about when you're taking a shower
Something to swallow when you're drinking bottled water

I'm gonna teach you how to expose the 90 percent
And show you what to do to keep the other 10

Twenty five percent of all men are unstable
Twenty five percent of all men can't be faithful
Twenty percent of them don't mean what they say
And ten percent of the remaining twenty is gay

Be patient! he's waiting!
You don't gotta settle for that
Leave what is past alone!
Get you a backbone!
Stop being (sorry for) yourself!

Have you no checklist?
It's gonna take patience
Time is still wastin'

Hey

Don't be a booty call (don't be)
If he don't respect you girl he gon' forget you girl

If he's in a relationship (relationship)
If he will cheat on her that means he will cheat on you

Tell him that you're celibate
And if he wants some of your goodies he gon' have to work for it.

Be the person you wanna find
Don't be a nickel out here lookin' for a dime.

Lyfe Jennings,"Sitting here thinking about
All the innocent people I done hurt in my past
Relationships, never felt the slightest bit bad
Until it happened to me
It's funny how we're so quick to laugh
When it's someone else
But then when it happens to us
The joke is never as funny as we all thought it was
Before we felt the same thing

And it's true that it's no fun
When the rabbits got the gun
And you're in love with the one that hurts you most
They say karma is a bitch
And I say I agree with it
Cause this whole experience has let me know

That breaking a woman's heart is like throwing a boomerang
It will come right back to you again
So remember that when it is happening to you
Don't cry when it gets hard
Because you threw a boomerang
And it came right back to you again
So remember that when it's happening to you

Used to play a lotta games with no conscious
Couple different lovers at once with no problem
Loved the way it felt to have everyone wanting me
Now I'm sitting here tryin to be strong but I'm hurting
And the sad part of it all is I deserve this
This was meant to teach me a lesson
It's working perfectly

Cause it's true that it's no fun
When the rabbits got the gun
And you're in love with the one that hurt you most
And they say karma is a bitch
And I say I agree with it
Cause this whole experience has let me know

That breaking a woman's heart is like throwing a boomerang
It will come right back to you again
So remember that when it is happening to you
Don't cry when it gets hard
Because you threw a boomerang
And it came right back to you again
So remember that when it's happening to you

Hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn
And heaven won't help you hide if you break her heart
Try ya best to be honest
Try to keep every promise
Cause in the end if it doesn't work out
She won't wanna be friends
And she gone want revenge

Don't break a woman's heart, it's like throwing a boomerang
It will come right back to you again
So remember that when it is happening to you
Don't cry when it gets hard
Because you threw a boomerang
And it came right back to you again

Go all the way, go all the way...",Boomerang
Lyfe Jennings,"See, women change every day
So that means that you have to learn her every day
You know? It's like going back to college, man
Let me show you what I've learned about my wife

She's got the cutest little laugh
Bottom lip twitches when she's mad
Favorite position from the back
Loves that musician, Robin Thicke
She gets her temper from her dad
Likes to say we just couldn't have
I know her like the back of my hand
So whatever she wants she can have

I treat her like college
I'm trying to get knowledge
Learning your girl is a science
Treat her like college
Go to class every day
So if you pay attention you can learn her ways
Like college, study in abroad
Learning all of her, man, ain't hard
Treat her like college
And you can gone on back
You won't need a grant for that

She likes long walks through the park
A little afraid of the dark
Her ex-boyfriend broke her heart
Her self esteem is ripped apart
She likes to gaze up at the stars
Believe there's aliens on Mars
Her favorite color is pink and orange
Her favorite food is fish and corn

I treat her like college
I'm trying to get knowledge
Learning your girl is a science
Treat her like college
Go to class every day
So if you pay attention you can learn her ways
Like college, study in abroad
Learning all of her, man, ain't hard
Treat her like college
And you can gone on back
You won't need a grant for that

I would take all the water out the sea to wash your hair
I would take all the birds out of the trees to sing you to sleep
'Cause I care
I would burn all the money in the world to keep you warm
And I would bring Michael Jackson back to life to moonwalk to your favorite song, baby
This is what I'd do, the impossible, do the impossible
This is what I'd do, the impossible, the illogical, we're unstoppable

I treat her like college
I'm trying to get knowledge
Learning your girl is a science

And she what she wants
She has expensive taste
And she can spot a broke ass…

But don’t let that young face you,
She knows exactly
Why she’s in the VIP
And it’s not because what’s in her heart
And she has in those jeans

She plays her part
And pretend she’s really interested when you flirt with her
But if they only knew
She’s attracted to the attention and not to you

iPhone 4 with the case iced out
Fresh off the porch with a blunt in her mouth
She from up north but her man down south

But you get this when yo ass that fat
Forget about the DJ, she can entertain us

Why buy a car when you don't plan to drive it?

Seems like y'all go through this all the time, she must be out her damn mind

And in her heart she knows she'll never be more than your chick on the side
Though she loves you, she still got her pride, and inside

She shouldn't have to get like this

But she don't know how that would make her feel
To see your little girl and look her in her eyes
And know that she's the reason why she cries
That would turn her up inside
And if you think about, it don't make sense, fucking up that young girl's life
'Cause in your heart you know she'll never be more than your chick on the side

Love her, or leave her alone, see what it's doing to her
Can't you see what you're doing in wrong
(Right now, choose) Either you're all in or all out

Give her what she deserves, if you can't put it in words

Those happy hours I spent with you
That lovely afterglow
Most of all I miss you so

Your sweet caresses, each rendezvous
Your voice so soft and low
Most of all I miss you so-o-o

You once filled my heart with no regrets, no fears
Now you find my heart filled to the top with tears

I'll always love you and want you, too
How much you'll never know
Most of all I miss you so-o-o

I'll always love you and want you, too
How much you'll never know
Most of all I miss you so-o-o
(ah, ah, ah, ah!!)
",I Miss You
Lyle Lovett,"The two-step it drug like a ball and chain
While the band was playing something like moon river or somewhere over the rainbow
And I was chasing the black man with the champagne
And I was chasing the black girl with the oysters rockerfeller

And it was a highbrow occasion
For no special reason
And nobody knew
Nobody knew
That the flowers were furnished by the funeral parlor
And the whole thing was paid for by the funeral director
Who poisoned the saxophone section

And if you ain't the big daddy
You ain't nobody
If you ain't the big daddy
You ain't nobody
Red and yellow, black and tan
But white that's the color of the big boss man
It was a twenty-piece orchestra at the Warwick hotel
With some fat man from the opera who tried to sing misty
And it was black men and black boys in white ties and tails
And mascara and rouge and fake fingernails

If you ain't the big daddy
You ain't nobody
If you ain't the big daddy
You ain't nobody
Red and yellow, black and tan
But white that's the color of the big boss man

They had them everywhere man
They had one on every foot and every hand
And they was all saying yes sir
And right away ma'am
And they was picking up plates
And they was pouring wine
And they was checking umbrellas
And making shoes shine
And they was handing out towels in the washroom
For a quarter

And it was an acceptable level of ecstasy
As far as everyone could see
But nobody knew
That the flowers were furnished by the funeral parlor
And the whole thing was paid for by the funeral director
Who poisoned the saxophone section

And if you ain't the big daddy
You ain't nobody
If you ain't the big daddy
You ain't nobody
Red and yellow, black and tan
But white that's the color of the big boss man",An Acceptable Level of Ecstasy (The Wedding Song)
Lyle Lovett,"The night she is a true companion
They shuffle in
They hear the sound
But by night's end
It's night's abandon
You look across the floor
Ain't anyone around

Closing time
Unplug them people
And send them home
It's closing time

Now Kenny he's been mixing sound all evening
Sometimes I think that boy
He ain't got no ears
And Kathy's laughing
Kathy's always laughing
Well keep on laughing Kathy
Just make it out of here

Closing time
Unplug them people
And send them home
It's closing time

So stack those chairs upon those tables
And stack those empties upon that bar
And count your money
And count my money
And hear those bottles ringing
You know where you are

Closing time
Unplug them people
And send them home
It's closing time

The night's all that's left behind
You take your part and I'll take mine
And go on home
It's closing time",Closing Time
Lyle Lovett,"Who keeps on trusting you
When you've been cheating
And spending your nights on the town
And who keeps on saying that he still wants you

When you're through running around
And who keeps on loving you
When you've been lying
Saying things ain't what they seem

God does
But I don't
God will
But I won't
And that's the difference
Between God and me

So who says he'll forgive you
And says that he'll miss you
And dream of your sweet memory

God does
But I don't
God will
But I won't
And that's the difference
Between God and me",God Will
Lyle Lovett,"The waltzing fool
He's got lights in his fingers
The waltzing fool
He just don't never say
The waltzing fool
He keeps his hands in his pockets
And waltzes the evening away

And it's a waltz to a woman
Who's lying beside him
It's a waltz to a face on the wall
When she's gone
It's a waltz to the rodeo
The damn thing it rides him
It's a waltz to a waltz

Now the waltzing fool
He just might be crazy
Because the waltzing fool
He keeps the moon in his car
And the waltzing fool
He says it's running
On waltzes and waltzes

And it's a waltz to a woman
Who's lying beside him
It's a waltz to a face on the wall
When she's gone
It's a waltz to the rodeo
The damn thing it rides him
It's a waltz to a waltz
Just a waltz to a waltz

Now the waltzing fool
They say he's been drinking
But the waltzing fool
He's just got mud on his shoes
And the waltzing fool
He knows they're all thinking
He's only an old waltzing fool

But the waltzing fool
He's got lights in his fingers
The waltzing fool
He just don't never say

Lyle Lovett,"It's Saturday night
You check the TV guide
And pray the black and white
Can keep you satisfied
She had yellow hair
She had high-heel shoes
She red the whole affair
And left you black and blue

In 1956
She was just a kiss
In 1985
How could she come to this

He had yellow hair
He like high-heel shoes
Lipstick was everywhere
And he left her black and blue

So it's Saturday night
You check the TV guide
And pray you'll be all right
Because it's your turn this time

What I saw in you
And I could tell you
Why I still see it too

Lyle Lovett,"She left Dallas for California
With an old friend by her side
Well he did not say much
But one year later
He'd ask her to be his wife

And the lights of L.A. County
Look like diamonds in the sky
When you're driving through the hours
With an old friend at your side

One year later I left Houston
With an old friend by my side
Well it did not say much
But it was a beauty
Of a coal black .45

And the lights of L.A. County
Look like diamonds in the sky
When you're driving through the hours
With an old friend at your side

So I drove on all the day long
And I drove on through the night
And I thought of her a'waiting
For to be his blushing bride

And the lights of L.A. County
They looked like diamonds in the sky
As I drove into the valley
With my old friend at my side

And as she stood there at the altar
All dressed in her gown of white
Her face was bright as stars a'shining
Like I'd dreamed of all my life

And they kissed each other
And they turned around
And they saw me standing in the aisle
Well I did not say much
I just stood there watching
As that .45 told them goodbye

And the lights of L.A. County
Look like diamonds in the sky
When you're kneeling at the altar
With an old friend at your side

And the lights of L.A. County
Are a mighty pretty sight
When you're kneeling at the altar
With an old friend at your side",L.A. County
Lyle Lovett,"I park my Pontiac
Down the hill out in back
Late every afternoon, I go there and sit
And all of the neighbors, they see a nice old man

And the girl there across the street
She sits there on her front porch swing
She never realized
But I told her with my eyes
Back in the Second War, I killed 20 German boys
With my own bare hands

The woman inside my house
She just keeps talking
She never says a thing
She just keeps on talking
I may just leave her still
After the sun goes down

And I smoke this cigarette",Pontiac
Lyle Lovett,"Now to find a man good loving

Lyle Lovett,"It's a simple song for simple feeling
You see the moon and watch it rise
Across the continent the night bird sings
And somewhere someone hears its cry

So disillusioned
Keep your head down
If you do they'll never know
You'll have no answers to their questions
And they will have to let you go

And disenfranchised
Revolution
They'll take away by right what's yours
And make you martyrs of your own cause
When they don't know what cause it's for

And all deserted
Stand alerted
They'll love you when you're all alone
But you find a red rose in the morning light
You wait the night and find it gone

So hear my words with faith and passion
For what I say to you is true
And when you find the one you might become
Remember part of me is you",Simple Song
Lyle Lovett,"A New Jersey lady I knew long ago
And she was a lady I say
But she met a cowboy who rode on the rodeo
And he stole her heart straight away

The New Jersey lady she loved him so true
Another love she never had
But cowboys are lonesome and cowboys are blue
And they make the ladies so sad

Sing me a melody
Sing me a blues
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes
The Brazos she's running scared
She heard the news
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes

The New Jersey lady knew he loved her too
And you know she tried to hold on
But the rodeo life was the life that he knew
He had to keep drifting along

She never married and she never would
And all of the people they'd say
The New Jersey lady she just ain't no good
To follow a cowboy that way

Sing me a melody
Sing me a blues
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes
The Brazos she's running scared
She heard the news
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes

The lady she'd sing him to sleep in the night
And then in the morning he'd go
She loved the darkness and hated the light
Along with that damn rodeo

The New Jersey lady the day that he died
She covered him over with clay
And feeling the wind in the night as she cried
She heard the old cowboy say

Sing me a melody
Sing me a blues
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes
The Brazos she's running scared
She heard the news
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes

Sing me a melody
Sing me a blues
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes

Lyle Lovett,"You got you some legs baby
That just won't quit
You got a pretty boy
And he looks pretty hip
You got you one on the sly
But you gave him the slip
And that's just a cryin' shame

'cause you love the boy
With pretty green eyes
And you love the boy
Who says he's so clever and wise
And you love the boy
Who's always telling you lies
And that's just a cryin' shame

Sometimes it never quits raining
Sometimes that phone just won't ring
Sometimes I never miss nothing
And sometimes I miss anything

But you like 'em tall when it's raining
And you like 'em dark when you're feeling no pride
But you never felt anything that you wanted to hide
And that's just a cryin' shame

So he says you look lovely my dear
You say thank you I'm fine
And you spend all his money
And you spend all his time
And you spend the night
Like you were spending a dime

Lyle Lovett,"It's a sunny day in California 
But that old sun it's shining on me right here at home 
It's one of those days 

When those great ideas they just seem to fall out on you 
And they always fall the greatest when you're falling all alone 
It makes for a good day for some serious reflection 
And massive rationalization 

For contemplating the future of the future 
And the last of the past 
And wondering if you could ever forgive me darling 
All the trouble that I put to you 
And if I could forget all those questions 

That I never asked 
And if I could forgive 
The temporary weight gain due to excess water retention 
I could forgive the rest too 
It's just a fact of life 
That no one cares to mention 
She wasn't good 
But she had good intentions 

So the grass it grows 
When the sun it shines 
And my face it glows 
When the woman's mine 
And you say I'm a fool-around 
Honey that may be true 
But I'd sooner fool around 
Than be a fool for a fool 
And if I could forgive 
The unadulterated adulterating apprehension 
I could forgive the rest too 
It's just a fact of life 
That no one cares to mention 
She wasn't good 
But she had good intentions 

So I'm twenty-six and rising 
Still too young to live 
But too low to go 
I guess it's the process 
Of learning to excess 
All of those things 
That you already know 
And if I could forgive 
The honey, I, swear, it, didn't, mean, a, thing, to, me 
Attempt at abstention 
I could forgive the rest too 
It's just a fact of life 
That no ones cares to mention 
She wasn't good 
But she had good intentions",Good Intentions
Lyle Lovett,"Hello
I'm the guy who sits next to you
And reads the newspaper over your shoulder

And a straight shooting gun 
Which way does that old pony run",Which Way Does That Old Pony Run
Lyle Lovett,"I know I've seen this place before
Lord can't you hear me screaming
As a young man long ago
When I was twenty-one

And I know I've seen this house before
With people all around it
With my baby cousin on the floor
And Mama in the kitchen

And a woman lies upon the bed
I think she must be dying
And I recall the words she said
As she began to cry

She begged son please don't go to Baltimore
And leave me where I'm lying
For you will son but I no more
Walk among the living

And if you go to Baltimore
Then I'll see you in heaven
And as you breathe I'll breathe no more
And I will surely die

Well you know I went to Baltimore
So confident and wise
And as I breathed she breathed no more
And she did surely die

And now as I lie upon my bed
I pray I must be dreaming
With faces all around my head
And strangers at my door

And a woman's voice calls out to me
Bring unto you your children
And let them see these things you see
And hear the words you say

Beg them to go to Baltimore
And leave you where you're lying
Just like you did one time before
When you were twenty-one

And if they go to Baltimore
Then I'll see you in heaven
And as they breathe you'll breathe no more
And you will surely die

And I know I've seen this place before
Lord can't you hear me screaming
And if I should awaken Lord
Then answer me my plea

What makes the sun set in the west
And birds fly in the sky
And what makes a woman beat her breast
When her children start to cry

And what makes those little ones grow old
To find eternity
And what takes the wise
And leaves behind
A foolish one like me",Baltimore
Lyle Lovett,"When I saw the ambulance screaming down Main Street
I didn't give it a thought
But it was my Uncle Eugene
He died on October
The second, nineteen eighty-one

Now my uncle Wilbert
They all called him Skinner
And they said for his younger ways
He'd get drunk in the morning
And show me the rolls of fifties and hundreds
He kept in the glove box of his old gray Impala

And we're all gonna be here forever
So mama, don't you make such a stir
Just put down that camera
And come on and join up 
The last of the family reserve

Now my second cousin, his name was Calloway
He died when he'd barely turned two
It was peanut butter and jelly that did it
The help, she didn't know what to do
She just stood there and she watched him turn blue

And we're all gonna be here forever
So mama, don't you make such a stir
Just put down that camera
And come on and join up 
The last of the family reserve

And my friend Brian Temple
He thought he could make it
So from the third story he jumped
And he missed the swimming pool only by inches
And everyone said he was drunk

And there was Great Uncle Julius
And there was Aunt Annie Miller
And Mary, and Granddaddy Po
And there was Hannah, and Ella
And Alvin, and Alec
And he owned his own funeral home

And there are more I remember
And more I could mention
And words I could write in a song
But I feel 'em watching
And I see 'em laughing
And I hear 'em singing along

We're all gonna be here forever

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid

I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

I sincerely appreciate the words you say
About how she'll cry
And how she'll grieve and miss me
When she goes away

Say them again
I need to hear the words once more
I can't believe
How she'll miss me when she's gone

What's that you say
That I'll get over her the more that time goes by
But time goes so slow
When all I have to do is sit around and cry

No she won't be back
I'd be a fool to try to fool myself that way
I know she hasn't one regret
Because she hasn't had one since
The day she came to stay

She's leaving me

Lyle Lovett,"I went to a funeral
Lord it made me happy
Seeing all those people
I ain't seen
Since the last time
Somebody died

Everybody talking
They were telling funny stories
Saying all those things
They ain't said
Since the last time
Somebody died

But you take a look around you
Don't it seem like something's missing
I said something that weren't missing
Lord the last time
Somebody died

You took him from the last time
To that hallowed ground
I'm praying take me to the next time Lord
So I can hang around

Then the people start to looking
And some of them start crying
And all the little children
Lord they're scared
Because they ain't never seen
A dead man before

You took him from the last time
To that hallowed ground
I'm praying take me to the next time Lord
So I can hang around

He's swimming through that Jordan
Going to the other side
But if it's all the same to you Lord
I think I'll stay dry

Now it's church on Sunday
It's a bar on Friday night
It's work on Monday
The preacher Lord you know he might sing

Hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah

He's got church on Sunday
And he got drunk the night before
And he got his good gal when he got home
The preacher said he wants some more of that

Hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah

Now if you want to get to heaven
Let me tell you what to do
You better grease your foot up buddy
With that mutton stew
And when the devil comes after you
With them greasy hands
You just slide on over to the promised land

Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah

Now there was two little imps
And they was black as tar
And they was trying to get to heaven
In an electric car
And that car wheel slipped
On down the hill
Instead of going to heaven
They went to Jacksonville

Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah
Sing hallelujah

Thank you, you've been so nice
All my friends they came
Now close the lid down tightly
And quit crying
Because when they close them
They all look the same

And grab hold of the handle
It won't be too heavy
And take me to the graveyard

I went to a funeral
And Lord it made me happy

You'd love me if I were a dresser like him

And see that boy with that guitar
He's got a blue Toyota like I always wanted
A Japanese girl in his car
It's a blue Toyota like I always wanted

You'd love me if I were a driver like him

You'd love me if I had a, like him
You'd love me if that my rear end

And faces go
Just like old Toyotas
That jap girl dumped my ass
And stole my clothes
She took my car
And left me singing

Like I always wanted
A girlfriend in his car 'cause he's got
Skinny legs

Lyle Lovett,"I've never been lucky
At picking up women
But this life that I live
Is not one that I choose
She was a waitress
With hair blond and curly
With a pretty black dress
And those Japanese shoes
Man I need to impress her
Cause I'd like to undress her
I need a song about Sonja
When I'm singing tonight
She looked so pretty
As she poured my coffee
But she had her eye
On my friend at the bar
And I watched her watch him
And I watched her thinking
I wish her eye was on me
Man I need to impress her
Cause I'd like to undress her
I need a song about Sonja
When I'm singing tonight
And if I could sing her
A tender love ballad
I'd hope that the audience might sing along
But I can't find the right way
To tell her my feelings
And still make the words rhyme with Sonja
No I've never been lucky
At picking up women
But this life that I live
Is not one that I choose
She was a waitress
Now she's gone forever
And I'm stuck with this song
That I never will use
Man you need to impress her
If you want to undress her

Lyle Lovett,"The girl at the grocery she's pretty and seems nice
But she looks right through me with eyes cold as ice
She never answers when I ask her name
She only says I should have a great day

But hey what could she mean by that
Perhaps I'm the fool she takes me for
Not anything more

I guess it's the season the time of the year
When people they're happy and full of good cheer
Well they'll wish you and kiss you and wish you again
And they'll tell you it's peace and good will to all men

But hey what could they mean by that
Perhaps I'm the fool they take me for
Not anything more

We stood at the altar and you held my hand
And everyone watched as the preacher he asked
Will you take him and love him for bad and for good
You looked at me then you told him you would

But hey what did you mean by that
Perhaps I'm the fool you take me for

You can't hold on to
What belongs to me
And don't belong to you

With your roving eye
So Mister you don't have to act
So surprised

If it's her you want
I don't care about that
You can have my girl
But don't touch my hat

On the open range
And that cold North wind
Can make a man feel strange

So if it's her you want
I don't care about that
You can have my girl

Son to be polite
Take your hat off
When you walk inside

But the winds of change
They fill the air
And you can't set your hat down
Just anywhere

So if you plead not guilty
I'll be the judge
We don't need no jury
To decide because

I wear a seven
And you're out of order
'Cause I can tell from here
You're a seven and a quarter

But if it's her you want
I don't care about that
You can have my girl

Lyle Lovett,"Once upon a time ago
Way up in the land of sleet and snow
How this fairy would go
I could not have know

I had searched around this world so mean
From Livingstone to Palestine
Trying to pursue my dream
Of love

It was then I met this girl so fine
She made me think so fast I left my thoughts behind
And I tried to pass for a sophisticated
Northern man

I said yes my dear, I know exactly what you mean
Because there's not so much I haven't done or seen
And may I say your eyes are the loveliest
Shade of Jade

I said well come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby

It was then I knew I had made my first mistake
She did not even start to wait
As she turned around to walk away
This is what she had to say

She told me man I come from way down South
I've got a picket fence with a picket house
And I don't need no fast talking Northern man
Like you around

I said well come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby

Honey I don't know what you just heard
But Alabama is my favorite word
And Birmingham
Is a long way from here

I could see the light began to shine
She turned back around her eyes met mine
And suddenly the whole world became
A better place

Even if it was only for an instant
Because it was then I knew I had made my
Second mistake

She told me man that was a real good try
But Alabama's not where I reside
I come from where the river is wide
And the craw fish hide

I said well come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby

Honey I don't know what you just heard
But Louisiana is my favorite word
And New Orleans
Is a long way from here

She just looked at me and shook her head
Your lines are pretty sad she said
You are a lonely, weak, pathetic man
If this is doing the best you can

It was then I knew I had made my third mistake
Yes three strikes right across the plate
And as I hollered honey please wait
She was gone

I said well come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby

Honey I don't know what you just heard
Bartender set 'em up are my favorite words
Because the love I need
Is a long way from here

Oh the love I need
Is a long way from here

Yes well there I sat so all alone
Like a king who sits upon his throne
And whose kingdom may have just gone home
With another kingdom

So as you can imagine much to my surprise
When the door was flung back open wide
It was a miracle
She walked inside
And pulled her chair up next to me

And that's when she knew
She had made her
First mistake

Honey I don't know what you just heard
But come on baby
Are my favorite words
And where we're going
Is a long way from here

And where we're going
Is a long way from here

So like I said before
I could not have known
How this fairy tale would finally go
Still the only certain thing for sure
Is what I do not know

So like the years and all the seasons pass
And like the sand runs through the hour glass
I just keep on running faster
Chasing the happily
I am ever after

I just keep on running faster
Chasing the happily
I am ever after",Her First Mistake

Tell your daddy I tried
Tell them I wish that I could explain

And the hotter it is you know the harder it gets

And it ought to be easier
When you turn your lights down low
And it ought to be easier
To leave when you know that you have to go

I know you don't believe me
And I know you don't understand
But honey the way that you treat me
I can't even tell who I am

And you tell me I'm the one you're not to blame
And you tell me I make you feel the same way
And we talk in circles but we never say
It's just out of weakness that both of us stay

And it ought to be easier
When you turn your lights down low
And it ought to be easier
To leave when you know that you have to go

I look at you when you're sleeping
And I think about how it could be
If you would wake up and open your arms
And hold me

But you look at me when you wake up
With eyes that are angry and mean
And I turn away and walk into the kitchen
And I pray for the strength to leave

Because it ought to be easier
When you turn your lights down low
And it ought to be easier
To leave when you know that you have to go
To leave when you know that you have to go

Lyle Lovett,"And his hand it fell behind her
As his arm it reached around
And she looked at the window
And she watched the shade go down

It was a private conversation
No one heard her say
That the man she left behind her
Was two thousand miles away

Singing boy pick up that fiddle
And play that steel guitar
And find yourself a lady
And dance right where you are

There was a lonely girl from nowhere
With a smile all sweet with pain
And she never stopped to wonder
If she'd see him again

It was a private conversation
No one heard her say
That man that she was looking for
Was only twenty streets away

And play that steel guitar
And find yourself a lady
And dance right where you are

And the band it just kept playing
As she came walking in

Why do I do the things that make you cry
Will I lose your love to another
Who loves you better than I

The angels smile when you're praying
But the devil laughs when you lie
And some things they go without saying
When tears fill up your eyes

Why do I do the things that make me sorry
Why do I do the things that make you cry
Will I lose your love to another
Who loves you better than I

Some questions beg for an answer

And she grew smaller in my mirror
As I watched her wave goodbye

Those boys from Carolina
They sure enough could sing
But when they came on down to Texas
We all showed them how to swing

Now David's on the radio
And old Champ's still on the guitar
And Uncle Walt he's home with Heidi
Hiding in her loving arms

But Texas wants you anyway

They're OK in Oklahoma
Up in Arkansas they're fair
But those old folks in Missouri
They don't even know you're there

But at a dance hall down in Texas
That's the finest place to be
The women they all look beautiful
And their men will buy your beer for free

And they'll say that's right you're not from Texas
That's right you're not from Texas
That's right you're not from Texas
But Texas wants you anyway

That's right you're not from Texas
That's right you're not from Texas
That's right you're not from Texas
But Texas wants you anyway

So won't you let me help you Mister
Just pull your hat down the way I do
And buy your pants just a little longer
And next time somebody laughs at you

You just tell 'em you're not from Texas
That's right you're not from Texas
That's right you're not from Texas
But Texas wants you anyway

That's right you're not from Texas

Oh which way to go
Babes in the woods
No one to say no
Pretty people come to me
Cry your heart all out
Tell me what it's all about

Who remembers kerouac
What was that all about
Right on jack
So long jack
Who remembers anything
And who cares anyhow
But here's to those still on the road
And those on the road back

Lyle Lovett,"Comfort me, said she,
With your conversation,
With the cocktails
And the candlelight
In your eyes

It's funny how we hunger
For some inspiration,
And everything else
That money just won't buy.

Men have lied,
Many good girls have gone astray,
Just to hear the gypsy play
One more lilting cowboy tune,
And as the rivers run dry,
And the mountains blow away,
They sing of lovers and how they lay,
Beneath this crazy frontier moon.

I ain't no golden boy,
I ain't no Grecian dancer,
And I ain't no loudmouthed cowboy
From the West,
I'm not the kind of man
With all the answers,
But I surely know the songs
That suit me best.

But lately I've had something on my mind,
It's growing stronger all the time,
Calling out when I'm alone,
But I'm a poet
And I'm bound to walk the line,
Between the real and the sublime,
And give the muses back their own.

It's a penny for your thoughts,
It's a dollar for your kisses,
Keep a running tab on the time,
'Cause what I've got the most of
Is what she misses,
The clock is hers,
The hourglass is mine.

But I'm her lover,
Not a man bent on revenge,
Hanging out here on the fringe,
Of my native borderlands.

Counting the days
The sun shone golden across her head,
Lying on the banks of the bayou's edge,
Kicking up some Southeast Texas sand.",Ballad of the Snow Leopard and the Tanqueray Cowboy
Lyle Lovett,"Some folks say there ain't no bears in Arkansas
Some folks never seen a bear at all
Some folks say that bears go around eating babies raw
Some folks got a bear across the hall

Some folks say that bears go around smelling bad
Others say that a bear is honey sweet
Some folks say this bear's the best I ever had
Some folks got a bear beneath their feet

Some folks drive the bears out of the wilderness
Some to see a bear would pay a fee
Me I just bear up my bewildered best
And some folks even see the bear in me

And even though your friends may stop and stare
Just remember that's a bear there in the bunch with you
And they just don't come no better than a bear

Lyle Lovett,"Day's full of rain
Sky's coming down again
I get so tired
Of these same old blues
Same old song
Baby it won't be long
'Fore I'll be tying on
My flyin' shoes
Flyin' shoes
'Til I'll be tying on
My flyin' shoes

Spring only sighed
Summer had to be satisfied
Fall is a feeling
That I just can't lose
I'd like to stay
Maybe watch a winter day
Turn the green water
To white and blue

Flyin' shoes
'Til I'll be tying on
My flyin' shoes

The mountain moon
Forever sets too soon
Being alone
Is all the hills can do
Alone and then
Her silver sails again
And they will follow in
Their flyin' shoes
Flyin' shoes
And they will follow in
Their flyin' shoes

Lyle Lovett,"My days they are the highway kind
They only come to leave
But the leaving I don't mind
It's the coming that I crave
Pour the sun upon the ground
Stand to throw a shadow
Watch it grow into the night
And fill the spinning sky

Time among the pine trees
It felt like breath of air
Usually I just walk these streets
And tell myself to care
Sometimes I believe me
Sometimes I don't hear
Sometimes the shape I'm in
Won't let me go

I don't know too much for truth
But my heart knows how to pound
My legs know how to love someone
My voice knows how to sound
It's a shame that it's not enough
It's a shame that it is a shame
Follow the circle down
Where would you be

You're the only one I want
I've never heard your name
Let's hope we meet someday
If we don't it's all the same
And I'll meet the ones between us
And be thinking about you
And all the places I have seen
And why you were not there",Highway Kind

Of words and games
I don't think I know you
I can't forget your name
Your eyes are clear
The way is strange
The light's in the hallway
If you forget your way

You were here to be only
What you wanted anyway
You were sad to be sorry
You were sorry everyday
You were here to be loved
But love's trickled away
From your eyes

I tell myself
I'm least of all to blame
For these words of my choosing
For my rules that make the game
But my eyes are clear
I can see the way is strange
Through the dark of the hallway
That echoes back your name

Wondering where you are
Lonely in love
Looking at the sky
Start to wonder my love
How long I'm going to burn
With this same old flame
I miss you all the time
Ain't unhappy
But I'm lonely in love

I know I didn't treat you right
Scared you into flight
Lonely in love
Never acted wise
Couldn't organize love
But these longings return
When I hear your name
I let you go and now
I can't forget somehow
I'm lonely in love

I'm young in the daylight
With a pocket full of money
Ladies to the left
And to the right
But when night time comes
I'm a star watcher honey
I can't get along
On light bulb light

So I'm looking at a star
Wondering where you are
Lonely in love
Looking at the sky
Start to wonder my love
How long I'm going to play
In this rained out game
It don't make any sense
But honey be convinced
I'm lonely in love
",Lonely in Love
Lyle Lovett,"Well won't you lend your lungs to me
Mine are collapsing
Plant my feet and bitterly breathe
Up the time that's passing
And breath I'll take and breath I'll give
And pray the day's not poison
Stand among the ones that live
In lonely indecision

Fingers walk the darkness down
Mind is on the midnight
Gather up the gold you've found
You fool it's only moonlight
And if you try to take it home
Your hands will turn to butter
You better leave this dream alone
Try to find another

Salvation sat and crossed herself
Called the devil partner
Wisdom burned upon a shelf
Who'll kill the raging cancer
Seal the river at its mouth
Take the water prisoner
Fill the sky with screams and cries
Bathe in fiery answers

Jesus was an only son
And love his only concept
Strangers cry in foreign tongues
And dirty up the doorstep
And I for one and you for two
Ain't got the time for outside
Just keep your injured looks to you
We'll tell the world that we tried",Lungs
Lyle Lovett,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Mama talked to me last night
She gave to me some good advice
She said, ""Son you ought to quit
This old ramblin' all around
And marry you a sweet loving wife""

But there's more pretty girls than one
More pretty girls than one
Any old town that I ramble all around in
There's more pretty girls than one

So honey look down that old lonesome road
Hang down your pretty head and cry
'Cause I'm thinking all about
Them pretty little gals and hoping that I never die

'Cause there's more pretty girls than one

Lyle Lovett,"Last night you know I couldn't sleep
I was tossing, turning, and counting sheep
To tell the truth
The next thing I knew
I woke up on the outside
In the middle of the avenue

A policeman spied me traffic there
In my t-shirt and my underwear
He said, son, son
It sure don't look good
The way you've been calling for your baby
All over the neighborhood

It seems I was sleepwalking
Again last night
The way I was sweet talking
It must have caused a terrible fright
Last night when I was sleepwalking

Someone saw me at a doughnut shop
I was sitting, crying on a tabletop
It was not a pretty sight
I was out of control
The way that I was carrying on
About my sweet jelly roll

I said officer please
My baby's got me down on my knees
Lying in bed
Late at night
Sometimes I just go out of my head
At night
And I go out sleepwalking

Later on down at the jail cell
I was hoping things would turn out well
Because I don't recall
That masquerade ball
And I don't remember nothing y'all
About that blown up rubber doll

So lately I've stopped going anywhere
And I've taken to sleeping with a teddy bear
It's a very full and rich
Imaginary life
And it's sure enough better than dreaming y'all
About any imaginary wife

Lyle Lovett,"That picture hangin' on the wall
Was painted by a friend
He gave it to me all down and out

Couldn't be more'n ten dollars worth
But they brighten up my day

Here's a book of poems i got
From a girl i used to know
I guess i read it front to back
Fifty times or so
It's all about the good life
And stayin' at ease with the world
It's funny how i love that book
And i never loved that girl

Hold this piece of glass
Up to the light comin' through the door
It's a prism glass i found on the road
Can you see that little rainbow
Well it's not really a prism i guess
It just broke in a funny way
I found it on my way from texas
Headed for l.a.

This guitar was given me
By old man thomas gray
It's not too much to look at
But i pick it every day
It's been across the country
Four or five times i guess
Between me and old man tom
It never got much rest

Well that's about all i own
And all i care to i guess
Except this pair of boots
And that funny yellow vest
And that leather jacket and leather bag
And hat hangin' on the wall
Just so it's not too much to carry
Could i see you again next fall

Tryin' to teach me a lesson
Thinkin' you'll come back to a better man
If you don't like the way things go
Just stay here and tell me so
'cause there's one thing about me
You've got to understand

I've had enough lonesome
In my education
I don't want to study anymore
About a woman and a slammin' door
If I want to be blue
I've got enough information
I know about lonesome
Teach me about love

Now the words from your sweet lips
And the looks from your sweet eyes
Are lessons that I study day by day
Each day I pick up something new
Each night I learn a thing or two
But how can I learn anything
When teacher's gone away

I've had enough lonesome
In my education
I don't want to study anymore
How to make it through a barroom door
I've been down and out
I'm ready for inspiration
I know about lonesome
Teach me about love

Lyle Lovett,"We crossed the wild pecos
We forded the nueces
We swum the guadalupe
And we followed the brazos

The wichita clear
But down by the brazos
I courted my dear

Singing li, li, li, le, le, le
Lend me your hand
Li, li, li, le, le, le
Lend me your hand
Li, li, li, le, le, le
Lend me your hand
There's many a river
That waters the land

Now the fair angelina
Runs glossy and gliding
The crooked colorado
Runs weaving and winding
The slow san antonio
Courses and plains
But I never will walk
By the brazos again

She kissed me and she hugged me
And she called me her dandy
The trinity's muddy
But the brazos quick sandy
She kissed me and she hugged me
And she called me her own
But down by the brazos
She left me alone

Now the girls of little river
They're plump and they're pretty
The sabine and the sulphur
Hold beauties a'many
The banks of the neches
There are girls by the score
But down by the brazos
I'll wander no more

Lyle Lovett,"Six o'clock silence of a new day beginning
Is heard in a small Texas town
Like a signal from nowhere the people who live there
They're up and they're moving around

'Cause there's bacon to fry and there's biscuits to bake
On the stove that the salvation army won't take
You open the windows and you turn on the fan
'Cause it's hotter than hell when the sun hits the land

Now Walter and fanny well they own the grocery
That sells most all that you need
They've been up and working since early this morning
They've got the whole village to feed

Well they put out fresh eggs, they throw bad ones away
That rotted because of the heat yesterday
The store's all dark so you can't see the flies
That settle on 'round steak and last Monday's pies

And sleepy hill's drugstore and the cafe they're open
The coffee is bubbling hot
And all the folks that ain't working gonna sit there 'til sundown
And talk about what they ain't got

Someone just threw a clutch in the old pickup truck
It seems like they've been riding on a streak of bad luck
The doctor bills came and the well has gone dry
Seems their grown kids don't care whether they live or die

I saw a hitchhiker
And his thumb was pointing my way

And he didn't look any too clean

I put on my brakes
And I opened my door
I could tell he was a bum
By the muddy boot he wore
He said I'm going down to Haskell
Got a woman down in Abilene

He said East Texas
Is where I come from
I was working a rodeo out there
And it sure got humdrum
So I'm just traveling around
A whole lot of Texas I've seen

I'm mighty glad
You were going my way
In your brand new clothes there
And your great big Chevrolet
I'm going down to Haskell
Got a woman down in Abilene

Well he was grinning like a possum
And a mighty happy rascal
And he waved good-bye
When I let him out in Haskell
And that's about the last
Of that old road tramp
I ever did see

Lyle Lovett,"I went to church last sunday
So I could sing and pray
But something quite unusual
Happened on that day

Now church it started right on time
Just like it does without a doubt
And everything was all just fine
Except when it came time to let us out

You know the preacher he kept preaching
He told us I have one more thing to say
Children before you think of leaving
You better think about the judgment day

Now everyone got nervous
Because everyone was hungry too
And everyone was wondering
What was the next thing he would do

And the preacher he kept preaching
He said now I'll remind you if I may
You all better pay attention
Or I might decide to preach all day

And now everyone was getting so hungry
That the old ones started feeling ill
And the weak ones started passing out
And the young ones they could not sit still

And the preacher's voice rose higher
So I snuck up on the balcony
And I crept into the choir
And I begged them brothers, sisters, help me please

I said when I give you a signal
I said when I raise up my hand
Won't you please join with me together
And praise the lord I have a plan

And the preacher he kept preaching
Long is the struggle, hard the fight
And I prayed, father please forgive me
And then I stood up and with all my might
I sang

To the lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now let's go eat
We've got some beans and some good cornbread
And I listened to what the preacher said
Now it's to the lord let praised be
It's time for dinner now let's go eat

Yes and I did give a signal
Yes and I raised up my hands
And then joined with me the choir
Yes every woman, child, and man
They sang

To the lord let praised be
It's time for dinner now let's go eat
We've got some beans and some good cornbread
And I've listened to what the preacher said
Now it's to the lord let praised be
It's time for dinner now let's go eat

And the preacher he stopped preaching
And a hush the church did fill
And then a great white dove from up above
Landed on the window sill

And the dove flew down beside him
And a fork appeared right in his hand
And with everybody watching
The preacher ate that bird right there and then

And now everyone got really nervous
And the preacher he did start to glow
And as we watched in disbelief
These were the words he spoke

He said now mama's in the kitchen
And she's been there all day
And I know she's cooking something good
So let's bow our heads and pray
And he sang

To the lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now let's go eat
We've got some beans and some good cornbread
Now listen to what the preacher said
He said to the lord let praised be
It's time for dinner now let's go eat

And the moral of this story
Children it is plain but true
God knows if a preacher preaches long enough
Even he'll get hungry too
And he'll sing

To the lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now let's go eat
We've got some beans and some good cornbread
Now listen to what the preacher said
He said to the lord let praised be
It's time for dinner now let's go eat

Lyle Lovett,"The boys from North Dakota
They drink whiskey for their fun
And the cowboys down in Texas
They polish up their guns

If you love me, say I do
If you love me, say I love you
If you love me, say I do
And you can say I love you

And I dreamed I was a cowboy
And I rode across the border

If you love me, say I love you
If you love me, take my hand
If you love me, say I love you
If you love me, take my hand
And you can say I love you
And you can have my hand

Waking up
With your arms around my head
You told me you can sleep forever
And I'll still hold you then

It's even cold down here
And the words that you have told me
Hang frozen in the air

Lyle Lovett,"I hear these women raving 'bout their monkey men
About their trifling1 husbands and their no good friends
These poor women sit around all day and moan
Wondering why their wandering papa's don't come home
But wild women don't worry, wild women don't have no blues

I've got a disposition and a way of my own
When my man starts kicking I let him find another home
I get full of good liquor, walk the streets all night
Go home and put my man out if he don't act right
Wild women don't worry, wild women don't have their blues

You never get nothing by being an angel child
You better change your ways and get real wild
I wanna tell you something, I wouldn't tell you a lie
Wild women are the only kind that really get by
'Cause wild women don't worry, wild women don't have their blues

Lyle Lovett,"She said something about going home
She said something about needing to spend some time alone
And she wondered out loud what it was she had to find
But she's already made up her mind

All my friends told me she was too young
Well I knew that myself and I tried to run
But the faster I ran the more I fell behind
Because she'd already made up her mind

She's already made up her mind

Now there is nothing so deep as the ocean
And there is nothing so high as the sky
And there is nothing so unwavering as a woman
When she's already made up her mind

So now she's sitting at one end of the kitchen table
And she is staring without an expression
And she is talking to me without moving her eyes
Because she's already made up her mind

She's already made up her mind

And she said something about going home
And she said something about needing to spend some time alone
And she wondered out loud what it was she had to find

And then sail with me out to that ocean deep
And let me go easy down over the side

All six-foot-seven
She sent him to where they parked
To go and get the car
She stayed behind there
She stood in line there
She got something to drink
And then she told me her name

She said the Alamo
Was someplace we could go
Or to the Hemisfair
To ride the needle there
And all along the River Walk
Well all she did was talk
And all I did was think

That's when I saw her, singin' and laughin'
Tryin' to pass me in a Volkswagen

She's as cute as a bug, short as a minute
She's a pretty little package with everything in it

""A skinny girl is a misery""
I shook my head because I knew he couldn't be right
But that's when I thought back to just last night

When I got home, it was maybe a little late
There was ne'er a crumb or ne'er a plate
There was no martini, no glass of grape
But it was then I sought to contemplate

Some things, my baby don't tolerate, no
My baby don't tolerate, no
My baby don't tolerate from me

I said, ""Hello honey, how have you been?""
She said, ""What could you possibly
Have been doin' until half past ten?""
And not bein' completely unsensitive
I could tell my ship had run aground
'Cause when I puckered up, you know she puckered down

Some things, my baby don't tolerate, no
My baby don't tolerate, no
My baby don't tolerate from me

Now a small, more ordinary man might not appreciate
Guidance of a good woman who truly loves him
He might drift in despair during the ignorant
Dumbness doings of his dirty daily existence

That's not me, no, yes siree
I'm proof that true love will set you free

Some things, my baby don't tolerate, no

He hopes a tire don't blow
Up near Albuquerque
He'll fuel and get some coffee
Cline's Corners truck stop
A waitress with a wet mop
Telling him to don't walk
He tips his hat and don't talk

He knows it's nothing but a good ride
No there's nothing there he can't slide
No there's nothing that he won't spin
No there's nothing to it do it again
No it's nothing but the big show
No there's nowhere that he won't go
No he never has to ask why
He knows it's nothing but a good ride

He says there's something about a sunrise
Waking up sleepy eyed
He says there's something about a highway
Telling him he can't stay
He says there's something about a long drive
That gives him some peace of mind
And there's something that he can't take
When he's coming in second place

He knows it's nothing but a good ride
No there's nothing there he can't slide
No there's nothing that he won't spin
No there's nothing to it do it again
No it's nothing but the big show
No there's nowhere that he won't go
No he never has to ask why
He knows it's nothing but a good ride

And when it's all over
He'll move a little slower
He'll back up to the trailer
And look toward Oklahoma
He'll pull out right through the middle of town
And watch the sun start sinking down
Still just lighting up the road signs
Getting ready for the next time.

He knows it's nothing but a good ride
No there's nothing there he can't slide
No there's nothing that he won't spin
No there's nothing to it do it again
No it's nothing but the big show

He told us I have one more thing to say

Because everyone was hungry too
And everyone was wondering
What was the next thing he would do

And the preacher he kept preaching
He said now I'll remind you if I may
You all better pay attention
Or I might decide to preach all day

And now everyone was getting so hungry
That the old ones started feeling ill
And the weak ones started passing out
And the young ones they could not sit still

And the preacher's voice rose higher
So I snuck up on the balcony
And I crept into the choir
And I begged them brothers, sisters, help me please

I said when I give you a signal
I said when I raise up my hand
Won't you please join with me together
And praise the Lord I have a plan

And the preacher he kept preaching
Long is the struggle, hard the fight
And I prayed, Father please forgive me
And then I stood up and with all my might
I sang

To the Lord let praises be
It's time for dinner now let's go eat
We've got some beans and some good cornbread
And I listened to what the preacher said

That great cat's still yawning
Because Saturday is gone

And I still feel the feeling
Of how you felt upon me
And it may be no big deal to you
But it's a very big deal to me

You were down and dirty
And he was tall and twenty nine
And I'm only disconcerted
Because you said you knew I wouldn't mind

But I still feel the feeling
Of how you telephone me
And it may be no big deal to you
But it's a very big deal to me

But you can't make a cool cat crazy
Like you can't make a gray cat brown
And you can't keep a wild cat
When she knows the wildest cat's in town

So it's Sunday morning
Yeah and I guess I had a coffee
Ooh 'cause I start recalling
A time I went astray

And I still feel the feeling

Lyle Lovett,"St. Mother Maria, watch over us please
As we wander around in this dangerous world
Thank Mother Maria, there's nothing so sweet
As the undying love of a South Texas girl

The three in the front seat, they sat on each side
That green and white '58 Fairlane 
It would drive down farm roads past open fields
Seeming like no big deal
As it was happening I never felt a thing

But now looking back it seems like it was everything
Singing with mom just so we could hear ourselves sing
Stealin' a drink from the cold can in daddy's lap
Protected by only a small thin brown paper sack

And the wind blew the echoes of long faded voices
And they'd sing me a song that the old cowboys sang
And I didn't know what the words meant or anything
I was just singing because I was supposed to

St. Mother Maria, watch over us please
As we wander around in this dangerous world
Thank Mother Maria, there's nothing so sweet
As the undying love of a South Texas girl

And with the windows wide open, it felt hot to us anyway
We three bound together on a day just like any day
They told me and taught me and showed me and bought me
Whatever I wanted from the corner you told them

You said the name Corpus Christi means the body of Jesus
Pronounce it Refugio city folks they don't know
It looks like Palacios but sounds like the lashes
Just listen the next time you watchin', Sid Lasher

And the wind blew the echoes of long faded voices
And they would sing me a song that the old cowboys sang
And I didn't know what the words meant or anything

As we wander around in this dangerous world

I was just singing

Now these days the car seats and open container laws
Show sure correctness, leaves no room for Santa Claus
Sitting right next to me she looks like that used be
Song that they sang for me

And with the windows wide open, it feels right to us anyway
The two bound together on a day just like any day

The wind blows the echoes of long faded voices
And they sing us a song that the old cowboys sang
And now that I know what the words mean and everything
I'm still singing

Under the scorching sun and through the driving rain
And when I set my sights on the mountains high
I bid my former life good-bye

I'm underneath the open sky
Where I'm subject to the natural forces

Took the 90 southbound to Ohio
On 80 west I'm Frisco bound
And when I get there I'll turn back around

For it's on these eighteen wheels I ride
I'm underneath the Western sky

And they'll drag them all right in the ground
And Mr. Bradley calls the score
But the cowboy he will try for more

And I'll spin and run and stop and slide

The Creeks, Seminole and the old Choctaw
They volunteered to move they say
We'll understand come judgment day

And I'm under Oklahoma sky

She said ""Whoa-o-whoa, I'm the girl with the holiday smile""

She told me ""Whoa my whoa me, I look so good beneath a Christmas tree""
She said ""Whoa-o-whoa, I'm the girl with the holiday smile""

She told me ""Christmas brings out the best in me""
She said ""My heart's so full of love and generosity""
""Whoa-o-whoa, I'm the girl with the holiday smile""

And ""Well the police here and the police there
""They ruin my Christmas spirit everywhere I go.""
""Whoa-o-whoa, I'm the girl with the holiday smile""

She told me ""Whoa my whoa me, I look so good beneath a Christmas tree""
She said ""Whoa-o-whoa, I'm the girl with the holiday smile""

Well she told me ""goodbye"" as she walked away
She said ""Son, if you're good maybe on Christmas day""
Whoa-o-whoa

I said ""Whoa my whoa me, she looks so good beneath my Christmas tree""
Whoa-o-whoa, she's the girl with the holiday

I met a hooker at the grocery store
She wasn't bad lookin', she was a pretty little whore
Whoa-o-whoa, she's the girl with the holiday
Well lord lord, she's the girl with the holiday
Whoa-o-whoa, she's the girl with the holiday

Silent night shining so bright
She ain't holy but she can hold me tight

Whoa-o-whoa, she's the girl with the holiday",The Girl With the Holiday Smile
Lyle Lovett,"And she has a dress of laces
It's worn in many places
The shoulder hangs upon her by a thread
And she has a need for sharin'
For someone warm and carin'
And no one sees a heart that's underfed

[Chorus]
Young girl in love
Young girl in tears
She hasn't seen the man she loves in years

And her mother is a waitress
At the harbor bar, good graces
Where the seamen come a fishin' with their lines
And it was one of them that caught her
And left her with a daughter
Who lives with hate and loving him in mind

[Chorus]

So the young girl goes to the water
And she calls out for her father
But she ain't seen the old man in some time
Yes, and he was always boastin'
Just a drinkin' and a toastin'
And one day he left his family far behind

[Chorus]

So the mother comes home a drinkin'
With a sailor who's a thinkin' out loud
That he might stay with them awhile
So she loads her mother's pistol
And she shoots him as he whistles
A song about a sailor's life in style

Young girl in love
Young girl in tears
She kills the only man she's loved in years
And with him dies her hopes, her dreams, her fears

And she has a dress of laces
It's worn in many places
The shoulder hangs upon her by a thread
And she has a need for sharin'
For someone warm and carin'
And no one sees a heart that's underfed
And no one sees a heart that's underfed",Dress of Laces
