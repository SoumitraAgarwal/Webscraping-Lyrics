Chely Wright,"To steal him's been your number one ambition
Bur sister here's one safe that you don't have to crack
I'll hand him over under one condition
A deal's a deal and you can't give him back

Cause he's a good ole boy
Good for nothing
Good at lying, good at loving
Good at leaving
When the rent comes due
He's a good ole boy and I'm a good ole girl
So I'll give him to you

Go ahead and take him with my blessing
He might even let you be his Sunday girl
If your not used to worrying and guessing
He'll soon shake up your cozy little world

Cause he's a good ole boy
Good for nothing
Good at lying, good at loving
Good at leaving
When the rent comes due
He's a good ole boy and I'm a good ole girl
So I'll give him to you

Cause he's a good ole boy
Good for nothing
Good at lying, good at loving
Good at leaving
When the rent comes due
He's a good ole boy and I'm a good ole girl
So I'll give him to you

He's a good ole boy and I'm a good ole girl
And I'll hive him to you",He's a Good Ole Boy
Chely Wright,"It breaks my hear to see 
That you're unhappy here with me 
The hurt you've tried to hide can't help but show 
I could cling to the past 
But I'm afraid it wouldn't last 
And I love you enough to let you go 

Don't think that I'm all through 
Or that I'm givin' up on you 
Our love's the most important thing I know 
But if I set you free 
It just might bring you back to me 
And I love you enough to let you go 

[Chorus]
I'll stand and hold the door 
And watch you walk away 
And welcome you back with open arms 
If you come back someday 
But for now it would be wrong 
To keep tryin' to hold on 
And I love you enough to let you go 

[Chorus]",I Love You Enough to Let You Go
Chely Wright,"I spent all day long just slavin' in the kitchen 
I wanted everything to be just right 
Yeah, the table's dressed with all the fancy trimmin's 
Won't he be surprised when he comes home tonight 

Well, it's half past five but there's no need to worry 
There's still lots of time after all he's always late 
When he's out with her he's never in a hurry 
So, I light a lonely candle and set his plate 

[Chorus]
Cause tonight he's comin' home to the last supper 
He'll break the bread and drink his wine alone 
I know God will forgive me 
Cause he knows how much I've suffered 
Lord, I'd like to have a picture of the last supper  

[Chorus]",The Last Supper
Chely Wright,"[Chorus]
Nobody but a fool would love you 
After the way you've done me 
Broke every vow you made me, broke every rule 
Who'd lie awake all night, cry til you were out of sight 
Loving you with all her might 
Nobody but a fool 

I don't know what it was that made me trust you like I did 
Stars got in my eyes or either rocks got in my head 
All I know was your two lips kissed me heavenly 
Til yesterday those tender lips kissed goodbye to me 

I put on the saddest song ignore the telephone
I go ahead and cry the make-up from my eyes
I let my mind play tricks and then
I let it fool me once again
Into thinkin' that I'll never be alright
Then when I'm no longer crazy and I'm back to my old self
I realize how good I've always felt 

[Chorus]

People tried to tell me how you'd hurt me I suppose 
But I was blind as any bat and deaf as any post 
You clawed me like a tiger, I loved you like a lamb 
And knowing I still do just shows me up for what I am 

[Chorus]
Nobody but a fool 
Nobody but a fool",Nobody But a Fool (Would Love You)
Chely Wright,"I've been out here seven dances in a row 
Yeah the band's so hot they won't play nothin' slow 
Stetsons and Wrangler jeans are floodin' through the door 
And it's sink or swim as soon as you hit the floor 

[Chorus]
I'm dancin' in a sea of cowboy hats 
Shoulder to shoulder and back to back 
Two steppin' fools as far as the eye can see 
They're ridin' the wave on that sawdust floor 
Rockin' the boat from shore to shore 
So jump right in cause this is where it's at in the sea of cowboy hats 

Feel free to scrape your boots til they've worn holes 
You won't get too far in here with rubber soles 
Yeah the place is packed and we're puttin' on a show 
In over our heads and caught up in the flow 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]",Sea of Cowboy Hats
Chely Wright,"I sat bored at my piano 
When he walked into the bar 
When he nodded from his table 
I said I know just how things are 
Cause the only time I see you 
Is when you've made your lady cry 
And you always say you'll only stay 
Till all her tears are dry 

Now for months I've watched you wrestle 
With that other side of you 
You're scared one day you'll lose your temper 
Yes and then you'll lose her too 
Oh they say that love is brutal 
And for years she's paid the price 
It might be too late you best not wait 
Till all her tears are dry 

[Chorus]
You better run to her and fall on your knees 
Swear that you'll be the man 
She's wanted you to be 
Then by the grace of God 
She'll let you lay there by her side 
And hold her gently 
Till all her tears are dry 

[Chorus] 

Hold her gently 
Till all her tears are dry",Till All Her Tears Are Dry
Chely Wright,"I tried my hand at the game enough
But I ain't lucky when it comes to love
I want it all but I never want to wait
You ain't like the ones I've known before
You stir up feelings that I can't ignore
This heart of mine finally understands

And baby, I've been held and I've been tied down
I've been wrapped and I've been unwound
I've been kissed oh
But I ain't never been loved
Till I Was Loved By You

Now people told me that I was wrong
But I knew love was a sweeter song
I kept waiting for the perfect melody
Now in your arms it's plain as day
Knowing you was worth the wait
Come say you'll never give up on me

(Repeat Chorus twice)
Till I Was Loved By You
Till I Was Loved By You
Till I Was Loved By You",Till I Was Loved by You
Chely Wright,"Another lonesome night 
Staring at the sky 
But I don't help to ease an aching heart 
The man up in the moon 
Keeps on talking himself blue 
And once again I'm left here in the dark 

[Chorus]
Let me talk to the woman in the moon 
I think I need another point of view 
That ol' man up there 
Doesn't seem to care 
Let me talk to the woman in the moon 

Heaven's up above 
I just want a little love 
Cause I'm so tired of living all alone 
Please lend a friendly ear 
Cause I need some help down here 
Somebody with the heart to be my own 

[Chorus]

I can't help but look up there and wonder 
Will I ever hold him in my arms 
Please help me with this spell I've fallen under 
Cause I can't seem to find my lucky stars 

[Chorus]

Let me talk to the woman in the moon",Woman in the Moon
Chely Wright,"I called him for days, he didn't answer the phone 
I drove by his house, I knew he was home 
A week's worth of papers and mail in the box 
I thought he was dead, I picked the lock 
I found him in tears in the dark on his knees 
With a hole in his chest where his heart used to be 
And he said

Don't call the doctor, don't call the nurse 
Call for the lady with the alligator purse 
She knows the spell to lift this curse 
Go find the lady with the alligator purse  

In an old stone house off 21st 
I found the lady with the alligator purse 
She answered the door, said I know who you are 
She lit a candle, consulted the stars 
When I saw her closing that reptile's hide 
I asked her point-blank, is my friend going to die 
And she said

I'm not a doctor, I'm not a nurse 
I'm just the lady with the alligator purse 
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst 
So said the lady with the alligator purse 

She said, look at what happened to Cleopatra 
When she didn't take my advice 
And Romeo, Juliet, they didn't get it 
Too bad, those kids were so nice 

By the time we got back to my pitiful pal 
There was no sign of life till he saw the alligator 
Purse on her arm, the gleam in her eyes 
She opened the bag, there was nothing inside 
She said, there's no secret, it's love that I use 
I just carry this bag because it matches my shoes 
And she said

Don't call the doctor, don't call the nurse 
Don't call the lady with the alligator purse 
Love is the magic of the universe 
Take it from the lady with the alligator purse 

Love is the magic of the universe 
Take it from the lady with the alligator purse 
The lady with the alligator purse",Alligator Purse
Chely Wright,"Woke up this mornin', put the coffee on 
Opened up the blinds and there was the sun 
Now, this ain't just another day 
It's the hardest one I've ever faced 

[Chorus]
Minute by minute, tear by tear 
If I can hang on and just be strong 
tomorrow will be here 
The hurtin' won't end, it's only just begun 
But I'll get over you, if I can make it through 
Day one 

I'll jump head-first into my work 
If I stay busy, maybe it won't hurt 
Anything to forget you're gone 
And keep the time from draggin' on 

[Chorus]

Someday I'll look back on it all 
And thank God my heart survived the fall 

Chorus 

Minute by minute, I'll be hangin' on 
But I'll get over you, if I can make it through 
Day one 
Yeah, I'll get over you, if I can only make it through 
Day one",Day One
Chely Wright,"They married young, right out of school 
Back in '78 
She rubbed his back, he rubbed her feet 
After a long, hard day 

Now they're livin' in Beverly Hills 
And it's all turned upside-down 
He gets a weekly massage, she gets a pedicure 
On different sides of town 

And they both know they've gotten far 
From the way they used to be 
She wakes him up in the middle of the night 
And cries, baby, listen to me 

We gotta get good at givin' again 
If we wanna have a life like we did back then 
We've got a second chance to let someone in 
Hey, we gotta get good at givin' again 
We gotta get good at givin' again 

A little girl walks in the park 
Holdin' hands with her daddy's mom 
She wants to know why that man is asleep 
On the bench with the dirty clothes on 

Grandma tells the innocent child 
It hasn't always been this way 
She slips a ten dollar bill in his shopping cart 
And whispers, mister, have a good day 

We gotta get good at givin' again 
If we wanna have a life like we did back then 
We've got a second chance to let someone in 
Hey, we gotta get good at givin' again 
We gotta get good at givin' again 

It oughta tell us something 
When the ones we should be lovin' 
Ain't getting what they need 
Don't be afraid to make the first move 
Take the lead 

We gotta get good at givin' again 
If we wanna have a life like we did back then 
We've got a second chance to let someone in 
Hey, we gotta get good at givin' again 
We gotta get good at givin' again 

Hey, we gotta get good at givin' again 
We gotta get good at givin' again",Gotta Get Good at Givin' Again
Chely Wright,"Columbus said the world was round 
Back when everyone said it was flat 
Just between me and you and the man in the moon 
Baby, it ain't anything like that 

[Chorus]
Cause were living in a heart shaped world 
Our head in the clouds, but our feet on the ground 
Yeah, we're living in a heart shaped world 
Don't you know baby, love makes the world go 'round 

Now, satellite pictures sent back to earth 
Shows a big, blue ball floatin' out in space 
We've got a vision, yeah, and we're on a mission 
To tell the whole planet it ain't that way 

[Chorus]

Don't you know baby, love makes the world go 
Don't you know baby, love makes the world go 'round",Heart Shaped World
Chely Wright,"The clock is ticking loud as thunder 
In this silent room 
The morning comes and I wait to see 
If it dawns on you 
That I can't make what little love you give me 
Be enough 
And I'm just a tick away from giving up 

[Chorus]
But it's not too late for you 
To turn this thing around 
And say the words to keep me here 
But do it now 
Cause love is slipping through our hands 
One moment at a time 
But it's not too late 
For you to change my mind 

The rings we're wearing on our hands 
Are made of the purest gold 
But what we're doing to each other 
Is getting old 
And now, the pedestal I've put you on 
Is crumbling, too 
But it's in your power to make it good as new 

[Chorus]

The clock is ticking loud as thunder 
In this silent room 
But it's not too late 
For you to change 

It's not too late for you to change my mind 
It's not too late for you to change my mind",It's Not Too Late
Chely Wright,"He wears a Harley Jacket and a kiss me smile.
Through his steel blue eyes I can see for miles.
He digs big band music and the Rolling Stones.
But we listen to country when we're all alone.
Cause it makes me crazy.
It drives me wild.
I like my lovin' country style.

Well, we're listenin' to the radio.
Flyin' down the highway.
Feelin' like outlaws.
Wind's goin our way.
Sittin' right beside him.
Hell-bent, holdin' on.
Flippin' through the stations.
Lookin' for a fast song.
Singin' along with the ones we know.
Listenin' to the radio.

Well, we stop for gas, but not for long.
Cause that Philco radio keeps us movin' on.
He floors that '66 Mustang, rag top 289.
While I blow him kisses from the passenger side.
Cause it makes him crazy.
It drives him wild.
He likes his lovin' country style.

Well, we're listenin' to the radio.
Flyin' down the highway.
Feelin' like outlaws.
Wind's goin our way.
Sittin' right beside him.
Hell-bent, holdin' on.
Flippin' through the stations.
Lookin' for a fast song.
Singin' along with the ones we know.
Listenin' to the radio.
Listenin' to the radio.

I slide on over when the song slows down.
I give him all my love to throw his arms around.
We're so in love we never touch the ground.
Blastin' through the wind in a wall of sound.

Well, we're listenin' to the radio.
Flyin' down the highway.
Feelin' like outlaws.
Wind's goin our way.
Sittin' right beside him.

Chely Wright,"Talk to him everyday 
Even though he's oh-so-far away 
And every night I lay in bed 
And hug the pillow where he laid his head 
And in my dreams I drift back to that high school kiss 
And the night he put his class ring on my hand 
I see our wedding day and it takes my breath away 
Once again, like it did back then 

I'm living on the love her left me 
And he gave me so much love in such a little time 
And that kind of love is hard to find 
One day we'll meet again in that sweet by-and-by 
But till we're back together 
I'm living on the love he left behind 

Our little boy down the hall 
Is trying to teach me how to play baseball 
Yesterday, I got choked up 
When he said, Mommy, You use daddy's glove 
I turned down a thousand bucks 
For his old pick-up truck 
I'm hangin' on to everything that's part of him 
I'll hold him in my heart 
Till I can hold him in my arms 
Once again 
But till then 

I'm living on the love her left me 
And he gave me so much love in such a little time 
And that kind of love is hard to find 
One day we'll meet again in that sweet by-and-by

Chely Wright,"Going through old dresser drawers
Fumbling through there closets
It's got to be here somewhere
I know it's round here somewhere

Searching from room to room
We couldn't have just lost it
I know it's round here somewhere
It's got to be here somewhere

Maybe we packed it up
With college books and winter clothes
Things we thought were in the way
Out of style or just outgrown

We didn't give it away
We just left it alone
We tried to find it one day
That's when we noticed it gone
I turned the house upside down
Praying I'd stumble across
Some sign that's it's still around
Got to find the love that we lost

Captured in old picture frames
Shinning in those faces
It used to be here somewhere
I know it's still here somewhere
Reflected in our children's eyes
How could we misplace it
I know it was here yesterday
How could it just slip away
it was more then just a box of junk
We stored away to gather dust
This was a dream we thought
We always could reach out and touch

We didn't give it away
We just left it alone
We tried to find it one day
That's when we noticed it gone
I turned the house upside down
Praying I'd stumble across
Some sign that's it's still around
Got to find the love that we lost

We didn't give it away
We just left it alone
We tried to find it one day
That's when we noticed it gone
I turned the house upside down
Praying I'd stumble across
Some sign that's it's still around
Got to find the love that we lost

Got to find the love that we lost",The Love That We Lost
Chely Wright,"She picked up his jacket 
And hid her earrings in his pocket 
So he'd have a reason to call 
But her telephone won't ring 
And the shame that it will bring 
Makes her regret it all 

She should be accustomed 
She oughta know you just can't trust 'em 
When he's got a wife that he ain't gonna leave 
Maybe she deserves what she's got comin' 
She can't hide and there's no runnin' 
From the guilty, lonely life she's bound to lead 

[Chorus]
Cause she's the other woman 
You've seen her before 
Deep in his eyes 
When he walks through the door 
But did you know that even though 
She's puttin' you through hell 
You don't have to hate the other woman 
She'll do it herself 

They tried to keep it undercover 
But you would soon discover 
That she's your worse nightmare comin' true 
You don't even know her name 
But you wish her a life of pain 
And believe you me that's what she's goin' through 

[Chorus]

No, you don't have to hate the other woman 
She'll do it herself",The Other Woman
Chely Wright,"They're either fallin' in or they're fallin' out 
That's the only kind of love you ever hear about 
But we're somewhere in between 
And it oughta go down in history 
Cause love is alive with you and me 
And it's a real good place to be 

[Chorus]
Cause we're right in the middle of it 
Yeah, right in the middle of it 
There's no fireworks and no big bouquets 
No hot romance on display 
But we don't think about breakin' up 
We're right in the middle of love 

Yeah, all our friends wonder how we made it last 
We say we're lookin' at tomorrow and not the past 
No, they're never gonna make a movie 'bout us 
Cause we don't have a Hollywood love 
The credits roll when a movie is through 
But there ain't gonna be an end to me and you 

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

We're just right in the middle of love 
We're just right in the middle of love",Right in the Middle of It
Chely Wright,"Sometimes I still think of you 
Love that's gone by and the things I didn't do 
Time heals hearts, so they all say 
Passage of years slowly pulls the pain away 
But there's still a little tenderness left in everything I do 
It's what I learned from loving you 
That's what I learned from loving you 

Times have changed, I have changed, too 
Even my eyes have turned a deeper shade of blue 
Well, I guess it's all that crying they went through 
It's what I learned from loving you 
That's what I learned from loving you 

Well, I had too much to learn to hold on to someone like you 
And it took losing you to make me see 
The man you needed to be 
 
I don't cry, though we're apart 
And someday soon someone else will need this heart 
And the next time I'm gonna know when a love is true 
It's what I learned from loving you 
That's what I learned from loving you 
That's what I learned from loving you 
That's what I learned from loving you",What I Learned From Loving You
Chely Wright,"People say I care too much
I'm so emotional 
A tender soul who's out of control
I've been told a hear like mine 
Is truly valuable
Worth even more than diamonds and gold
I'm overloaded with love
I've been saving up
For someone else who can't get enough
I must have a ten lb. heart

[Chorus]
A ton of devotion
And gallons of tears
An old flame still burning 
From my nineteenth year
Exploding with passion 
And raging romance
(Begging)urging me constantly to take one more chance
And let this love inside of me start
Flowing from my ten lb. heart

I need someone adventurous 
This is serious
The timid hearted need not apply 
Faithful and available
With some experience
In handling a heavy desire
So now if I've described you
And you need someone who
Can share your dreams and make them come true
Look inside my 10 lb. heart

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Please won't you help this love inside of me start
Flowing from my ten lb. heart",10 Lb. Heart
Chely Wright,"I think I know what you're about to say
I can see it in your eyes and on your face
We swore we never would
So while the words are still unspoken 
Don't you think you should

[Chorus]
Take a breath
Take a moment
Take your time
Before you lie
Cause once you do
Love is different
Everything changes 
Between you and I
And it gets easier every time
Oh and you can still change your mind
Before you lie

All I ask of you is honesty
We said that's how this love will always be
So careful what you say 
Cause it only takes a half a truth 
To throw it all away 

[Chorus]

It's up to you
This can go either way 
You get to choose
Which road we take 
So 

[Chorus]
Before you lie, before you lie",Before You Lie
Chely Wright,"I found it in a pawn shop in a ragged cardboard case
With the guns and dusty watches it looked so out of place
With a Trailways baggage sticker yellow frayed and torn
Destination Nashville Septemper '64

[Chorus]
And you could tell by the fingerboard her painted nails were long
She only needed three cords to play those good ole country songs 
And her name's etched in the finish like a fading battle scar
And this 1950 Gibson was Emma Jean's guitar
 
I wonder if she played it in a small town talent show
With her hair teased to perfection in a dress her mama sewed
And for a little inspiration she pasted on a star
Here up on the head stock of Emma Jean's guitar

[Chorus]

Doooooo doooo

I wouldn't even know her if I saw her face to face
But there's a little bit of Emma Jean in every song I play
She passed along these hopes and dreams cradled in my arms
And I am just a guardian of Emma Jean's guitar

[Chorus]

This 1950 Gibson was Emma Jean's guitar
Doooo dooo doooo doo  ooooooo",Emma Jean's Guitar
Chely Wright,"Well I really had a ball last night
I held all the pretty boys tight
I was feelin' single seein' double
Wound up in a whole lot of trouble
But today I'll face the big fight but
I really had a ball last night

When I came home from work this mornin'
My baby was feelin' low
And he told me what was on his mind
Then he told me where I could go
Well I didn't want to go where he told me to
Cause the water was cold in the lake
Now there's somethin' fishy 'bout this whole deal
I don't see where I made my mistake

When I woke up this mornin'
Like me the sun was high
Well I started walkin' the long way home
Just to think of an alibi
Well I couldn't think of a doggone thing
That hadn't already been said
So I guess I better just play it by ear
For I'm already dead

But today I'll face the big fight but
I really had a ball last night",Feelin' Single - Seein' Double
Chely Wright,"Caution's in the wind
The hardest part is through
You don't have to try so hard
To make me fall for you

I've surprised myself
With what I've gone and done
Just today I heard my self
Swear you were the one

Laugh I just have to laugh
I really thought you knew
I can't believe
That you're asking me
When I will love you
I already do
I already do

You've been doing fine
Please don't change a thing
It's too good to hide away
So I might as well come clean

I didn't shout it out
But everybody knew
Funny you're the only one who didn't have a clue

Laugh I just have to laugh
I really thought you knew
I can't believe
That you're asking me
When I will love you
I already do
I already do

I gave you my heart
Can't you fell the power
You want to see the light
Baby the sun's been up for hours

Laugh I just have to laugh
I really thought you knew
I can't believe
That you're asking me
When I will love you

I already do",I Already Do
Chely Wright,"It's been a long time comin'
I've been alone so long
My heart is doin' somethin'
Can't put my finger on 

I feel it when you touch me
I see it in your eyes
I get the feelin' we're fallin'
Fallin' side by side

[Chorus]
Is it love yet?
Is it real?
Cause ya know I love the way you make me feel
Oh we took our chance
We took our time 
And if it's love boy I won't mind
I'll take all I can get
Is it love yet?

My mama always told me
You'll know when love is true

To look at you and all you are
And I think I can unlock the mystery
Break through your walls and win your heart
I don't mean to scare you
There's no need to be afraid
We can take our time
But I'll take my chance and say

Let me love you really love you
Open up your heart and let me in
I don't know who taught you not to trust
I'll be constant as the sun that shines above
Close your eyes and take the fall 
If it's really love there's no risk at all
I can love you if you'll only let me in

I see your strength and how you shine
You're a diamond in the rough that should be mine
But you're still fighting an old old war
That's left you wounded and left you scarred
You hide your weakness
Behind those walls
You think it's your own secret
But in your eyes I see it all

Let me love you, really love you
Open up your heart and let me in 
I don't know who taught you not to trust
I'll be constant as the sun that shines above
Close your eyes and take the fall

The one that's so strong it strangles your will to survive
He's mastered the art of looking sincere

And I had to break your heart to make you see
That he's the one who will be missing you
And you'll only miss the man

Blink back the tears show me you've still got your pride
Just get yourself lost in a sad country song

Chorus:
And you could tell by the fingerboard her painted nails were long
She only needed three cords to play those good ole country songs
And her name's etched in the finish like a fading battle scar
And this 1950 Gibson was Emma Jean's guitar

I wonder if she played it in a small town talent show
With her hair teased to perfection in a dress her mama sewed
And for a little inspiration she pasted on a star
Here up on the head stock of Emma Jean's guitar

Chorus 2:
And you could tell by the fingerboard her painted nails were long

Chely Wright,"I guess we guess are way through life
How many times do we really know for sure?
I was just hoping for the best
Then I woke up in these lovin' arms of yours
What I felt was unmistakable
When I fell for you

It was real, it was magic
It was calm, it was savage
It was cool as a breeze
It was warm to the touch
It was never enough
It was always too much
It did all the things love does
That's how I knew
It was

Who thought that I could laugh so loud
Then turn around and cry so many tears
I used to have so many doubts
But one by one you made them disappear
What I found was unbelievable
But I believe it's true

It was real, it was magic
It was calm, it was savage
It was cool as a breeze
It was warm to the touch
It was never enough
It was always too much
It did all the things love does
That's how I knew
It was

You asked what I felt when you walked through the door
Was it fear?
Was it clear?
It was all that and more

It was real, it was magic
It was calm, it was savage
It was cool as a breeze

When she asked him for the keys
Said, ""I'm going to the market
Is there anything you need?""
The first quarter was underway
He never missed a play

She pulled out of the driveway
Took a left at the light
Didn't stop at the market
She just drove right on by
Across the railroad tracks
She never once looked back

She went out for cigarettes
And just kept driving on
He didn't even know it yet
Bur she's gone
As far away as she can get
Passed the point of no regret
She went out for cigarettes
And just kept driving on

Half time is over
The sun is sinking low
It's almost time for supper
But there is nothing on the stove
He looks up from his easy chair
He just noticed she's not there

She made a stop at the bank
Took out some cash
Now she's racing down the highway
On a full tank of gas
As fast as she can go
To where she does not know

That I sing when I drive
That I sleep with the TV on

I love September when leaves turn gold
I get nervous in crowded places
Someday I want to see San Francisco
I'm bad with names, but remember faces
I need more than a kiss, more than a lover

You gotta keep that pretty smile upon your face

You tried to tiptoe in
I sat here for hours
Wondering where you've been

You ran into an old friend
And you just lost track of time
When you told me that there was something
About the twinkle in your eye

So I just laughed it off
It's no big deal
It's a scratch I know
Tomorrow you're gonna heal

It's the easiest thing, I could have done
When you love someone for the long run
For the long run

I know, I'm no angel
You know that's the truth
There's no need to remind me
Of all that we've been through

But the good times keep on coming
And the bad ones ain't so bad
And the worst that ever happens
Is still the best I've ever had

So I just laughed it off
It's no big deal
It's a scratch I know
Tomorrow you're gonna heal

It's the easiest thing, I could have done
When you love someone for the long run
For the long run

One thing that you've taught me
That I never knew before
No one ever loses
If no one's keeping score

So I just laughed it off
It's no big deal
It's a scratch I know
Tomorrow you're gonna heal

It's the easiest thing, I could have done

Chely Wright,"I fumbled with a napkin, i had a glass of wine
I was a little early, i had a little time
I sat up at the bar talking to a stranger
It seemed a safe thing to do
While i was waiting, while i was waiting for you

He said that i was pretty, then he turned back to his beer
And something about this stranger was subtle and sincere
He said he grew up in Memphis but he didn't like the blues
And our one dance turned into two
While i was waiting, while i waiting for you

When you walked in the door
When you walked up to him
When you took my hand and said that you were cutting in
This stranger from Memphis was very polite
He said you sure do have a lovely wife
Wife, he thought i was your wife

Well that's what got me thinking, it's like someone slammed the door
You just want to girlfriend, i want so much more
You ask me what's the hurry? you say let's take our time
Well i say our time it just flew

Ooo wouldn't it be cool 

Wouldn't it be cool if I could do long division in my head
Wouldn't it be cool if I didn't have to edit what I said
Wouldn't it be cool if life was fair

If one day you beg and plead for me to take you back
I would be so unaffected I would simply laugh and laugh
Wouldn't it be cool... cool 

Wouldn't it be cool if I could catch you at a restaurant with her
And wouldn't it be cool if I was strong enough to muster up the nerve
To tell her all the secrets that we had
Just to see you squirm and feel as bad as I do

Chely Wright,"In the back of the bottom drawer
Of the dresser by our bed
Is a box of odds and ends
That I have always kept

But the man who sleeps beside me
Doesn't know it's even there
Little pieces from my past
That I shouldn't have to share

A napkin that is stained with time
Has a poem on it
That didn't quite rhyme
But it made me cry

In a Dear Jane letter
From a different guy
He broke up with me
And he told me I'm not always right

And a stolen key
From an old hotel room door
In the back of the bottom drawer

I don't keep these things
'Cause I'm longing to go back
I keep them because I wanna stay
Right where I'm at

I'm reminded of my rights and wrongs
I don't wanna mess this up
But I wouldn't know where I belong
Without this box of stuff

A birthday card from my first boyfriend
He signed it 'I love you' so I gave in
Yeah, we went too far in his daddy's car
And those Mardi Gras beads from '98

We danced all night, stayed out so late
We thought we were stars
Closing down the bars
That champagne was cheap

But still I've got that cork
In the back of the bottom drawer

I'm not trying to hide these things
From the man I love today
But I'm a better woman for him
Thanks to my yesterday

So now I try to give more than I take
And I bite my tongue
Fight the urge to say
'It's my way or no way at all'

And now I cherish love a whole lot more

In line at the grocery store.

It wasn't a lucky strike
Or a different lover every night
Or a heavy metal song that made the warnings come true
There's no whiskey hard enough to do the damage that you've done
By packing up and leaving like you said you'd never do
It wasn't sex, drugs, and rock and roll that got me

I should have been living it up
But I was little miss perfect and still ended up here
Well, I would have had a whole lot more fun

Well, I guess it would be my own bed

Chely Wright,"On a Friday night where I grew up there ain't a whole lot you can do
The same old faces, the same old places, ain't nothin' ever new
After the football game we'd hang around the high school parkin' lot
Then we'd pile into a couple of cars and head off to our favorite spot
Down to the river
We went to the river

My sophomore year was a carbon copy of the ones that came before
Until that night in late November that shook us all down to the core
We'd won the game by twenty points, couldn't wait to celebrate
But our lead car was goin' way to fast and they didn't even hit the brakes
They went into the river 
Deep in the river

We buried Laurie Maybrie in the clothes that she'd been wearin'
Her cheerleader outfit never looked so outta place
That sweater and that pleated skirt of blue and white and crimson
Just didn't belong in that shiny silver case

I moved here to Nashville on May 12 of '89
And I started gettin' letters once a week from this friend a mine
I'd gone to school with Christine Thorough from kindergarten on
She'd say, ""Hang in there 'cause I just know you're gonna be a star""

She and her boyfriend and a couple a kids I guess she met through him
Set out for the merazine to try to cool off by takin' a swim
There'd been a lotta rain that summer and the current was too strong
I heard that they did all they could but Christine, she was gone
Into the river
She died there in the river

I was baptized in that same water, gave my soul to Jesus
How can such a peaceful place be filled with so much pain?
Cause two young mothers lost their daughters right there for no reason
I swear I'll never go down there again

But today I'll face the big fight but
I really had a ball last night

When I came home from work this mornin'
My baby was feelin' low
And he told me what was on his mind
Then he told me where I could go
Well I didn't want to go where he told me to
'Cause the water was cold in the lake
Now there's somethin' fishy 'bout this whole deal
I don't see where I made my mistake

When I woke up this mornin'
Like me the sun was high
Well I started walkin' the long way home
Just to think of an alibi
Well I couldn't think of a doggone thing
That hadn't already been said
So I guess I better just play it by ear
For I'm already dead

Around each other enough

Ya ves, ya ves, que no basta con sentir
Tal vez, tal vez, es mejor dejarlo aquí
Esperarte y conformarme con tu voz

Cuando el viento sopla en contra
Y no vienes al rescate, cuando yo me vuelvo loca

En el cofre de mis sueños, aún queda la esperanza
Siete pétalos marchitos de la flor de la pasión

Tal vez, tal vez, es mejor dejarlo aquí

Qué difícil aprender a estar sin tí
Dos ángeles sin cielo que algún dios unió hasta el fin

Nada que perder ya mi mundo esta al reves
Nada que perder ya no hay nada que perder

Ando decidida a la cita
Me quedo de piedra al comprovar
Que es mi amigo de toda la vida
Ya no se ni como reaccionar
Me pregunta, hola como estas?

Ndad que perder esto quiero y lo tendre
Nada que perder todo puede ser
Nada que perder ya mi mundo esta al reves
Nada que perder ya no hay nada que perder

Chenoa,"(Hay que ser muy cruel)
Tiene dieciséis
Y un gran porvenir
La guapa de clase
Ejemplo a seguir

Pero nadie se lo espera
Su cuerpo perfecto
Cambia por momentos
Belleza por huesos, infierno
Que la arrastra hasta morir

No somos perfectos
Ni estamos solos
Venciendo complejos
Que te vendieron

Hay que ser muy cruel
Para hacer creer
Que no hay que comer
Para ser mujer

Hay que ser muy cruel
Para hacer creer
Que vale la pena
Dejar de comer
¿Y es que no te ves?

A los dieciséis
Comenzó a mentir
Salió de sus planes
Luchar por vivir
Y llego la primavera

Que sirva de ejemplo
Su corta carrera
Las flores más bellas se secan
Si se empeñan en partir

No somos perfectos
Ni estamos solos
Venciendo complejos
Que te vendieron

Hay que ser muy cruel
Para hacer creer
Que no hay que comer
Para ser mujer

Hay que ser muy cruel
Para hacer creer
Que vale la pena
Dejar de comer

Cheo Feliciano,"Para mí el guaguancó es una alborada
Es la tristeza que me hace sonreír cada mañana
Es lo que llega desde el barrio al alma adentro
Lo que se filtra por el mismo corazón

Lo que en las venas se hacen locos sentimientos
Lo que me hace palpitante de emoción
Para mí todo eso es guaguancó
Para mí todo eso es guaguancó

Es más que la mulata que menea
La cintura como una revolución
Va más allá del toque de un tambo
Y hasta el amor me parece un guaguancó

Para mí el guaguancó es una alborada
Porque en el alma se prendió como una luz
Es una fuerza penetrante de verdad
Es la cadencia que me da felicidad
Es la cadencia que me da felicidad

Este es el guaguancó, este es el guaguancó
Anda rumbero, a la rumba buena
Te están llamando pa' que goces como yo
Este es el guaguancó, este es el guaguancó

Ven y ven, ven y ven pa' que goces luego
No digas que se perdió
Este es el guaguancó, este es el guaguancó
Si todo el mundo la goza, si todo el mundo
La baila báilala tú como yo

Esto es la rumba sabrosa, esto es el guaguancó
Este es el guaguancó, este es el guaguancó
Oye, si ya encontré lo que faltaba
Y el que faltaba era yo

Como me pedistes salsa aquí está mi guaguancó
Oye que suene, suene que suene el quinto rumbero
Que la rumba se prendió guaguancó es lo más sublime
Y aquí está mi guaguancó

I'm still in love, still in love with you now.

I don't wanna see you go, but darlin', you'd better go now.",Go Now
Cher,"To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go

To right the unrightable wrong
To love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable stars

This is my quest, to follow that star
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
To fight for the right without question or pause
To be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause
And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest

And the world will be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star",The Impossible Dream (The Quest)
Cher,"[Chorus]
More-I don't know how to
More-I die without you
More-and I would stop the world turning
I stop the sun burning
But I can't love you more

More-is there more than a lifetime
More-count the stars in the nighttime
More-I'm already your slave love
That's what I gave love
And I can't love you more

Every breath that I take
My first thought when I wake
Every song I hear
How I feel when you're near
How I feel by your side
How I'm glad I'm alive

At Ruby's place
Where the music was always playing
Girls were alive
While the men were saying

[Chorus]
Apples don't fall far from the tree
Hey honey, come sit on my knee
Apples don't fall far from the tree
And I remember mama's tears
When they said in a few years
I'd be something to see

At seventeen
I had me a diamond
And a string of pearls
Men said they preferred me
To the other girls
They took me to the best of places
But I could read it on their faces

[Chorus]

Then when mama died
I made up my mind
To get on a gray hound
Get out of this town
And leave it all behind
But life goes on
A child of three
Smiles up at me while she plays
A man I loved
Has never heard of Ruby's place
When he holds her with affection
And he uses that old expression

[Chorus]",Apples Don't Fall from the Tree
Cher,"The fortune queen of New Orleans,
Was brushing her cat in her black limousine
On the backseat were scratches from
The marks of men her fortune she had won
Couldn't see through the tinted glass,
She said ""home James"" and he hit the gas
I followed her to some darkened room,
She took my money, she said ""I'll be with you soon""

Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me than I knew myself

She dealt two cards, a queen and a three
And mumbled some words that were so strange to me
Then she turned up a two-eyed jack,
My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black
She said the man you love is secretly true
To someone else who is very close to you
My advice is that you leave this place,
Never come back and forget you ever saw my face

Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me than I knew myself

So I ran home and crawled in my bed,
I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said
Then I remembered her strange perfume,
And how I smelled it was in my own room!
So I sneaked back and caught her with my man,
Laughing and kissing till they saw the gun in my hand
The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor,
Dark lady would never turn a card up anymore

Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one
Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done
Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me than I knew myself",Dark Lady
Cher,"When I was a little girl in Dixie
I used to chase the fireflies
Then I grew up and started chasing the guys
Teenage romance what just the thing
Till I got in a family way
Now mama only working in a cheap cafe

[Chorus]

Waiting on tables and passing myself around
Dixie girl, you're the small talk
In a small talking town
I fall in love every day with someone
Who ends up just driving away
While I dreaming I with him
Going down that west bound highway

One night a man walks in and smiles
And orders coffee black
Took me for a ride in his brand new cadillac
Told me he loved me with all his heart
I told him I loved him too
He said goodbye Dixie, I'll be back for you

[Chorus]

Now all I do is read those
Hollywood photograph magazines
Work my shifts for tips
And live alone in my dreams
I'm a Dixie girl who prays
Some day she'll be a Delta queen
Find a good man,
Who'll raise me and my baby

Cher,"I was by myself drinkin' chilled, loney wine
Then he walked in with some woman 
Who's place was once mine
And she wore his ring on her finger
And the band began a song
I'd heard before

I saw a man and he danced with his wife
How I wished he was dancin' with me
'Cause I remember before 
When we danced on this floor
His eyes were only on me

Where did I go wrong
They were playin' our song
While I was cryin' all night long
I kept watchin' as they danced so divine
I kept hopin', kept on lookin' 
But I couldn't catch his eye

Oh, then he got up
And he saw me
But he just walked right on by
And danced with her

I saw a man and he danced with his wife
How I wished he was dancin' with me
'Cause I remember before 
When we danced on this floor
His eyes were only on me

Where did I go wrong
They were playin' our song
While I was cryin' all night long

Two weeks later I heard a knock on my door
He was back 
Just like all those good times before
Ah, then he kissed me
And he told me I left her 'cause I love you
So much more than I knew

I saw a man and he danced with his wife
But now he's dancin' with me

Oh the camel's back is broken 
By the one extra straw added on
And a woman can't see reason 
When her last ray of sunshine is gone
There's a finger on the trigger and that locomotive sound
And I think how much I love you and I turn the gun around

Oh the train of thought's runnin' right on time
But it's off the track and I'm losin' my mind

 At sweet sixteen
 I was growing up too fast

 Who taught me his own way to live
 And all I had to do to keep him
 Was to give and give

 The carousel man
 Kept me going around and round
 Carousel man always know
 That I'd stay around
 The carousel man
 Wouldn't let me off his merry-go-round

 I followed him around in traveling shows
 Along the main county lines
 Watching him drinking his mind away
 Not ever knowing my name at time
 Each night when the show closed down
 He used to tell me of his dreams
 He was wearing new French suits
 While I mended my torn jeans

 [Chorus:]

 Then one night in Santa Fe
 The horses stop going around
 There he was my poor rich man
 Lying on the Mexico ground
 All the sad music of his life
 Is still spinning in my mind
 The carousel starts up again
 And I found my place in life

Cher,"Won't you let me rock and roll you baby
I haven't seen you in a long, long time
I haven't fooled around with any candles lately
Just thought you might have some music in mind

Oh, I just want to serenade you
Maybe we could even live a verse or two
And I could finish this old love song
So I could start singing it to you, oh
I could start singing it to you
If I could finish this old love song
Then I could start singing it to you

Won't you come and boogie-woogie with me, baby
It's been a while since I held you close to me
I haven't met many boys like you, baby
Knew I would find you eventually

Oh, I just want to serenade you
Maybe we could even live a verse or two
And I could finish this old love song
So I could start singing it to you, oh baby
I could start singing it to you, oh honey
If I could finish this old love song
Then I could start singing it to you

If I could finish this old love song
Then I could start singing it
Then I could start singing it to you

Cher,"Now the greenest green I've ever seen
Was the grass on which you laid
And the bluest blue was in my eyes
When you said you couldn't stay
And the biggest lost I ever took
Was losing what we've begun
And the greatest song I ever heard
Was the one we never sung

Now the reddest red I've always said
Is the sunset coming down
Soon the blackest night that kills the light
Is the only thing around
And the downest down I ever been
Is when I knew my race was run
And the greatest song I ever heard
Was the one we never sung

Time will kill the pain they say
And we'll live to love another day
If you want to win you got to play the game
Now the greatest break came on the day
We were standing in the rain
And the hardest hurt I've ever know
Was when you tried to ease my pain
And the longest day in history
Waiting till my crying's done
And the saddest song I ever heard
Was the one we finally sung",The Greatest Song I Ever Heard
Cher,"I can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do?
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrow

And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again

I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories do days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow
And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again",How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?

 And any way you never know

Baked a tray of muffins
Hung some wet-wash out to dry

I could look them in the eye
You've gone away, you've gone away
How will I get though the day?
This God-forsaken day
Drank some bitter coffee
Read your note ten times or more
When I'd washed the dishes twice
I got down and scrubbed the floor
Empty chair at supper
Everybody's actin' strange
Food just gettin' cold
Kids real quiet for a change
You've gone away, you've gone away
How will I get through the day?
This God-forsaken day
Rain was fallin' hard
As I walked slowly up the stairs
Pushed my tears back down
As I stood listenin'
To their prayers
There's your empty pillow
Your side's flat right to the wall
Now's the time for private cryin'
Now it hurts me

We tell ourselves
We'll try once more
To once again we lay here
Barely touching in our bed
We're just two people
Clinging to a thread

And so we just pretend a bit
And we never say the words

Still we go on trying
To fan the dying spark
And sometimes
Even reach out
For each other in the dark

Heading for the coast
Trying to make the most of this misery

And it's tearing me apart
Well I guess it all comes down to lovin' you

On the road again

Tomorrow I will play L.A

And it's tearing me apart
And I guess that's just the way my story goes
Well there's a hunger in my veins
And it's driving me insane
But I guess it all comes down to love and pain

Well there's a hunger in my veins
And it's driving me insane
So won't you help me(help me)

Cher,"I was so lonely until I met you
Told myself I'd get by without love
Drownin' my sorrows
Avoiding tomorrows

And your jokes and your smiles
And the way that you came every night
I don't what you got

Cher,"Do I ever cross your mind darling
Do you ever see
Some situation somewhere somehow
Triggers your memory
And do you ever wonder
What became of all the time
And darling, do I ever cross your mind

Do you ever want to know
If all dreams go on endlessly
Or do they just run down somehow
Gradually become the custody
Or that melancholy jaded by the time
And darling, do I ever, ever cross your mind

Do I ever cross your mind
When you're lonely
Or does that only happen to me

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now

So on we go, 
His welfare is my concern
No burden is he to bare, 
We'll get there
For I know he would not encumber me

If I'm laden at all, 
I'm laden with sadness

With gladness of love for one another

From which there is no return 
While we're on our way to there, why not share

How could you leave me on my own
You know I hate to sleep alone

Remember how it used to be
When you were here with me
You were the only one I've known
And how I hate to sleep alone

Someday, some way, somebody new

Not so long ago, Ah, not so very long ago

Living in a house divided
With a love that's so one-sided
There's no chance at all
The walls have got to fall
Tumbling down

Look at us the King and Queen of emptiness
Living inside our castle of loneliness
Unable to make amends
Such perfect strangers are we
Is this how it will end?
Just a sad story.

You follow your heart wherever it goes
To the ends of the earth
For the rest of your days
Whatever it takes yeah you'll find a way
Through fire and rain
When love calls your name

Now I see a light
And it keeps getting brighter
And shows me the way
And it's there in your eyes
Pulling me closer everyday
After all of this time
The tables have turned
Yes, I'm finally ready to learn

[Chorus:]

You do what you must
You take it on faith
You take it on trust
You're out of control
And all that you know
Your world's not the same
When love calls your name

When love calls your name",When Love Calls Your Name
Cher,"You're looking at him from across the room
Wondering just how it all slipped away so soon
You're looking to find some look in his eyes
That will take you back to yesterday

Don't remember the when or the where or why
All you know is that something has changed inside
And you can't bring it back, no matter how you try
You know it's over, you've got to say goodbye

Such a shame when lovers become strangers
Such a shame when you don't know each other any more
And all the memories that you shared are all that's still there
It's such a shame when lovers become strangers

You can't seem to find the right words to say
And it's too late for talking now, anyway
There's no one to blame, it's just not the same
And it's never gonna be the same again, no

So you're trying to figure out what went wrong
Where does the feeling go when the feeling's gone?
And you pray for the strength just to carry on
You've got to let go of someone you've loved so long

It's such a shame when lovers become strangers
Such a shame when you don't know each other any more
And all the memories that you shared are all that's still there
It's such a shame when lovers become strangers

So kiss him goodbye, try to walk away
With your head held high
Think about the good times, don't cry, don't cry
Though it's tearing you apart inside

It's such a shame, such a shame
And you can't bring it back, no matter how you try
You got to let go, you've gotta say goodbye

Such a shame when lovers become strangers
Such a shame when you don't know each other any more
And all the memories that you shared are all that's still there
It's such a shame when lovers become strangers

Such a shame when you don't have each other any more
And all the memories that you shared are all that's still there
It's such a shame when lovers become strangers
Lovers become strangers

Cher,"I remember every word you said
We can't go on this way
Last night, you had me going out of my head
Should I go or stay?
But I've given you everything
That one woman could give a man
So when you gonna recognize and realize
Just what we had, now tell me
Who you gonna believe, her or me?
What's it gonna be, Who you gonna believe?
Before your heart shatters, love is all that matters
You put me through
That lover's game over and over
Someday someone's gonna
Put you through the same
Lover to lover
I hope you don't find out too late
I hope you never have to feel the pain
'Cause if you lose
The love you took for granted
That you could never appreciate
Who you gonna believe, her or me?
Who's it gonna be, who you gonna believe?
Before you make up your mind
You better take some time
What about me, don't you think
I need a man here standing by my side
And what about you, you need a woman
To hold you through those cold and lonely nights
Oh, what about us we belong together
Forever and ever, oh I'll be there
If you should ever need me
Oh, I know everything will work
Out fine, just believe it
Oh, I know cause we've been through
This a million times, keep on believing
Well I hope you don't find out too late
Hope you never have to feel the pain
'Cause if you lose the love you took for granted
That you could never appreciate, after all this time
Who you gonna believe, her or me?
Who's it gonna be, who you gonna believe?
Who are you fooling, well you're not fooling me, no
Who you gonna believe, you can risk it all
With someone else's world wondering if it's love
Baby oh baby, you should know by now
You can believe in me, believe in me",Who You Gonna Believe?

In my desperate eyes
Look how I need you

That you are casting out
The deepest love you'll ever know

Please don't close your ears
To what I'm saying
Before I ride away into the early day
I spent the lonesome evening hours praying
That you will change your mind
And try me one more time

Come to your window
Before our love comes crashing
Into pieces on the ground

I'll never let you down

And I want to go to the bathroom
What do we do now
What do we make of this

Can my blood flow

Lets throw our hearts in the mire

Lets sell our eggs to any buyer

Lets sew our pants together

We've made a liar of desire

And with the boy she vanished in
The secret sweetness of their sin

A young girl of sixteen
Child of springtime still green
Laying there by the road

So they roam place to place
Although she realized she sinned
She threw caution to the wind
As she followed him around
While he slowly dragged her down
So overpowering was the love
That he had made
It captured all the young girl's hearts
And soul and mine
In another words love drove her blind

[Chorus]
Too much emotion for a girl
She let her heart become her world
A world that God has never wrought
That brought us under we are taught
Had she'd been wise and she had known
She could of fed him love alone
She should've know the day would come
When he would quit her for fun
He needed fresh young meat to carve
And left her heart and mind to starve

And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie,

But sometimes things happen 
That we can't foresee

Just remember I love you 
And though I'm not here 
Just call if you need me 
And I'll always be near

Better sit down kids
I'll tell you why, kids
You might not understand, kids
But give it a try, kids
Now how should I put this

You mother is staying 
But I'm going away 
No, we're not mad, kids

Cher,"When my friends told me you had someone new,
I didn't believe a single word was true.
I told them all I had faith in you.
I kept right on sayin':
Oh, no, not my baby.
Oh, no, not my sweet baby.
You're not like all those other girls 
Who play with man's hearts like they were toys.
 
My mama told me, ""Son,when rumors spread 
That there is truth somewhere 
And you should use your head.""
But I sure didn't listen to what she said;
Don't you know I kept right on sayin':
Oh, no, not my baby.
Oh, no, not my sweet baby.
You're not like all those other girls 
Who lead you on and tell you lies, no, not my baby.

As you said goodbye to me

Don'tcha know that you bring out the best in me
Whenever you're near

Yeah, 'cause my share of sorrow
I walked off on promises and love's passed me by
But now you've turned the tables
See you make me feel as though it's my turn to die

There's a little girl inside
Who's lost on her way
Only you can bring me back

I lose all control
And when the morning comes, yeah, you loved and gone
Don'tcha know I need it over and over and over and over again

Yeah, you touched me deep inside
Now I can't say no
Dragged my heart around

Gonna make you wonder
Gonna make you mad
Same ol' heartache your best friend
Has come to visit once again
Your mistake was in the beginning
When you thought that he would last
When you weren't looking
No you weren't listen
And once he left you broke like glass

Let this be a lesson to you
Take this message to your heart
Love is gonna slip right through you
You got to watch it from the start

Thought you had yourself a true love
Thought he was in love with you
But he was just like a devil
Took your heart and broke it to
Well there's no telling who's on the level
And there's no way to know what's real
Just remember how it all happened
And be sure that you know who's got the deal

Let this be a lesson to you
Take this message to your heart
Love is gonna slip right through you
You got to watch it from the start

Let this be a lesson to you
Take this message to your heart

Cher,"I know that on some narrow street
Our paths will cross
Our eyes will meet
And love will leave me at his feet
I'm waiting for the gunman

When I enter a room
I will only sit facing the door
It's love I'm looking for
As I search every face
I start to wondering, is this the place?

[Chorus:]
For love is a gunman and no mercy has he
He'll hunt you down until the day death sets you free
Love is a gunman, and he's coming to town
You'll meet his gaze, both barrels blaze
Staring you down
Love is the gunman and no mercy has he
This time his sights are set on me

You can run, you can hide
You can even saddle up and ride
But love won't be denied
You can wear a disguise
But it isn't fooled by alibis

Cher,"I've been romanced and I've been danced
Crazy nights and hard times
Life has lost it mystery
And love is blind, and can not find me

Cause I'm blowin' away
And shadows take my love and leave
I'm blowin' away
And shadows keep taking
My love and leaving me

I have past aside my foolish pride
Going down for the very last time
Cause I have searched this earth
And sailed the seas
But love is blind can not find me

This is a man's world

Nothing without a woman or a girl

To take us over the road
Man made the train
To carry the heavy load
Man made the electric lights
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water
Like Noah made the ark
This is a man's man's, man's world
But it would be nothing
Nothing without a woman or a girl 

Man thinks of little baby girls And the baby boys 
Man make them happy 'Cause man makes them toys 
And after man make everything, everything he can 
You know that man makes money to buy from other man

I don't know if even Heaven knows
But I know we had dreams

And now I'm not the one,
Little boy, who's keeping you

[Chorus]
I was either standing in your shadow
Or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying
I could not make it right
For this girl
There's not enough love in the world

I know people hurt you so bad
They don't know the damage
They can do, and it makes me so sad
How we knock each other down
Just like children on a playground
Even after that o' sun went down

[Chorus]

Oh darling this is still a shady little town
And sometimes it's so hard to smile
For the world, for the camera
And still you have something left
You don't have to prove nothing to nobody
Just take good care of yourself

I'm not easy to live with
I know that it's true
You're no picnic either, baby
And that's one of the things
I loved about you
But a time will come around
When we need to settle down
Got to get off this merry-go-round

Cher,"You say, you want to live some
Move out into the fast lane
You say you need excitement
To make you come alive

Some place, a million miles
From the shadows that surround you
I look for your attention
You're lost out in the future

Where lovers ask no questions
And shadows never fall
Some pilgrim bound for paradise
No compromise, paradise is here

It's time to stop your crying
The future is this moment
And not some place out there
Tonight I need your love

Don't talk about tomorrow
Right now I need your loving
Right now give it to me
Right now I want your loving
Right now, now, now, now

You talk about your new plans
To move up on the stairway
Your dream about the high life
That's waiting for you there

A world of fame and fortune
That's just around the corner
But I don't need no high life
To make me feel a real man

And I don't need to reach for
No castles in the sky
Just put your arms around me
Devour me 'cause paradise is here

It's time to stop your crying
The future is this moment
And not some place out there
Tonight I need your love

Don't talk about tomorrow
Right now I need your loving
Right now give it to me
Right now I want your loving
Right now, now, now, now

Tonight I need your loving

And as I watched my world go walking out the door
I see I won the peace but I have lost the war

 Set your sights on simple beauty
 Like the way my eyes shine

I carry you away

With my love song with my love song
With my love song with my love song",Dov'è L'amore
Cher,"In the east and in the west
Every bird will seek its' nest
Everyone will seek its' home
Home is where the heart goes

And the moon will rise and fall
And the light will touch the tide
Are we holding hands and never feeling?

All around the world we sing
Like a penny in a spin
Always looking for the way
To get out, to get in

[Chorus]
Love is the groove in which we move
Love is the groove in which we move
Love is the groove in which we move

In the alleys o Monsay
In the streets of Katmandu
On the high roads of Peru
People meet and touch and go

But the wind of change will blow
And another dance will start
And I'll finally get the point
Like an arrow to my heart

[Chorus]

Look back where's the sea
Who brought this mystery?
Deep in another world
Someone is listening

And they as with night
And we keep asking why
Look back there's the key
Deep in another life

On this ship in which we sail
Everything is possible
Keep on turning like a star
Till you get to where you are

If I promise not to laugh
Will you promise not to cry?
Will you promise not to let this life
Slip by?",Love is the Groove

The power sets us free

Ain't nothing changed much through the years

Every good day breeds it

You know it's real

In every street, in every town
A story is unfolding
A story is unfolding of love and hate
The most of us wait of hopes and fears
Of smiles and tears of dreams
That lies a moldering

Behind the door of every house,
In every street, in every town
The stage is set for playing
The stage is set for playing
And I call crime and punch your mime
Sweet romance, a rich will dance
Characters are playing

Behind the door of every house,
In every street, in every town
The people are a waiting
The people are a waiting
To bare and die, the years go by
The wedding spree the cruelty
And still they go on mating

And to the one the only one

Is greater again

But Julie you're messing with a naked flame
I'm a dangerous rain that wash all your lies away

Well I never, Julie you're the shape of sin
But I can strut boy, when the line dance begins
So cool it Julie or I'm gonna do you in

Julie, Julie why do you taunt me
Julie, Julie you're lying
Julie, Julie Why do you haunt me
Julie, oh Julie you lying bitch

Well you think I'm just flying
With strings of a kite
But Julie I hope you're not for oblige
I'm flying higher
And I am the one holding the knife
He's all that I got and he's all that I want
Well Julie for the last time enough is enough
Take it from me you'll meet no meaner woman, no

Cher,"NEVER SHOULD'VE STARTED
WRITERS ERIC CLAPTON, STEPHEN BISHOP

Holy Mother, where are you?
Tonight I feel broken in two.
I've seen the stars fall from the sky.
Holy mother, can't keep from crying.
Oh I need your help this time,
Get me through this lonely night.
Tell me please which way to turn
To find myself again.
Holy mother, hear my prayer,
Somehow I know you're still there.
Send me please some peace of mind;
Take away this pain.
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait any longer.
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait for you.
Holy mother, hear my cry,
I've cursed your name a thousand times.
I've felt the anger running through my soul;
All I need is a hand to hold.
Oh I feel the end has come,
No longer my legs will run.
You know I would rather be
In your arms tonight.
When my hands no longer play,
My voice is still, I fade away.
Holy mother, then I'll be
Lying in, safe within your arms.



",Never Should've Started
Cher,"TAKE IT FROM THE BOYS

So scared I never been
Too hard to keep it in
Good girl, independent citizen
But you can't go back
No they never let you back
Same dance different hall
Some guys they get it all
But you can't go back
And they're ready to attack
And you can't go back
And you're terrified
You're gonna fall

[Chorus:]
Take it from the boys in the street
Take it from the boys
Take it from the boys that you meet
Making all that noise
They got you sipping
On a dry martini on a rack
They're slipping out
The back door no slack
Maybe it's the same
With every man you meet
You might as well be wise
And take it from the boys
In the streets
Take it from the boys
Take it from the boys
You might as well be wise
And take it from the boys
In the streets
Take it from the boys
Take it from the boys
You might as well be wise
And take it from the boys

Do this and promise that
Well that's how they're all about
Watch out, you're dealing with a photostat
When they say they care it's a bonify affair
Look out, beware of the businessman
Express American, he'll be gone so fast
Cause he travels first class
With his now and powie stash
And his heart unofficial glass

[Chorus x2]

You got to let down your shield

And when on a cold black night
Gives up a fight
We all fly home

Well where will you turn
When you're tired of running
Will you hear me calling,
Telling you which way to go
Don't pretend that you
Don't feel the danger

 So I sit inside my dressing room
 Waiting for the band to play
 And I wonder what is left to loose
 Where is anyone, any way

 Outside a neon, face from exhaustion
 Screaming with promise of what's inside
 But nobody's watching
 I go for the money, my wallet's a liar
 Nothing inside cause the world is on fire

 So I give them that old routine
 No one listens, any way
 When I fight for what it means
 God I wish I had someone here today

 So I give them that old routine
 No one listens, any way

And will you still love me tomorrow

That love and only love
Can join the tribes of man

That it all begins with you and me

Cher,"The fortune queen of New Orleans
Was brushing her cat in her black limousine
On the back seat were scratches
From the marks of men
Her fortune she had won
Couldn't see through the tinted glass
She said, ""Home James"" and he hit the gas
I followed her to some darkened room
She took my money, she said,
""I'll be with you soon""

[Chorus]
Dark lady laughed and danced
And lit the candles one by one
Danced to her gypsy music
Till her brew was done
Dark lady played black magic
Till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me
Than I knew myself

She dealt two cards, a queen and a three
And mumbled some words
That were so strange to me
Then she turned up a two-eyed jack
My eyes saw red but the card
Still stayed black
She said the man you love is secretly true
To someone else who is very close to you
My advice is that you leave this place
Never come back and forget
You ever saw my face

[Chorus]

So I ran home and crawled in my bed
I couldn't sleep
Because of all the things she said
Then I remembered her strange perfume
And how I smelled it once in my own room
So I sneaked back
And caught her with my man
Laughing and kissing
Till they saw the gun in my hand
The next thing I knew
They were dead on the floor
Dark lady would never
Turn a card up anymore

Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word
Half-breed, she's no good they warned
Both sides were against me

We never settled, went from town to town
When you're not welcome you don't hang around
The other children always laughed at me
""Give her a feather, she's a Cherokee""

Cher,"I'm sitting in the railway station. 
Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 

Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me. 
Homeward bound,

Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting

You got the kind of lips that do more than drink

You got the kind of mind that does less than think

Where do we go
Where can we turn
When we need some love
It seems that love just can't be found
Where, where do we stand

We got enough stars to light the sky at night
Enough sun to make the whole world bright
We got more than enough

We could use some love to ease these troubled times
Not enough love and understanding why, oh wh-why-why

Reaching everywhere but where we need to reach the most
Hearts never can win
Oh, in this race

We've got enough cars to drive around the world
Enough planes to take us anywhere

And loving you is all I ask, honey
All I ever need is you
Winters come and they go, and we watch the melting snow
Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you
Some men follow rainbows, I am told
Some men search for silver some for gold
I have found my treasure in your soul, honey
All I ever need is you
Without love I'd never find the way
Through ups and downs of every single day
I won't sleep at night until you say, my honey

They can close their eyes knowing there's nothing to fear
They can't see a thing
Whistle through the trees 'cause they are still children
They are still children
Now their time has come and gone they are grown all to soon
It seems children in their land and dreams
Dancing through the light music that only they can hear

Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

After all, what else is livin' for?

Ooh, I'm gonna burn my candle at the dance.

I'm wanna meet a bad boy in the night,
We're gonna make some bad love, wrong or rightâ?¦",Bad Love [From the Movie Foxes]
Cher,"I was born in the wagon of a travelin' show
My mama used to dance for the money they'd throw
Papa would do whatever he could
Preach a little gospel
Sell a couple bottles of doctor good

[Chorus:]
Gypsies, tramps and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsies, tramps and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down

Picked up a boy just south of Mobile
Gave him a ride, filled him with a hot meal
I was sixteen, he was twenty-one
Rode with us to Memphis
And papa would of shot him if he knew what he'd done

[Chorus]

Never had schoolin' but he taught me well
With his smooth southern style
Three months later, I'm a gal in trouble
And I haven't seen him for a while, oh
I haven't seen him for a while, oh

Cher,"Wasn't it good?
Wasn't it good?

Wasn't it good
The way that I touched you late last night?
Wasn't it good again
In the morning's early light?

Did you know
When you closed that bedroom door
I betcha didn't know
Exactly what I had in store

Wasn't it good
When you felt it coming through you?
Wasn't it good
That I knew just how to do you?

Did you know
You never had it like this before?
I betcha didn't know
You'd be coming around back for more, more, more

Let's have a party
Love's pouring out of my soul
I'm your party, hearty
And let the future take control

Just remember my darling
When there's time to spare
You'll be thinking about me
And our hot affair

Saying, wasn't it good
Wasn't it good, so good

Wasn't it good
When you let your body go?
Wasn't it good
When you let the juices flow?

Did you know
You never had it like this before?
That I betcha didn't know
That they don't make 'em like me no more, more, more

Let's have a party
Love's pouring out of my soul
I'm your party, hearty
And let the future take control

So let's have a party
We'll make the best of it while we can
God you won't be sorry
'Cause I'm committed to pleasing my man, my man

Just remember my darling
When there's time to spare
I'll be thinking about you
And our hot affair

Saying, wasn't it good
Wasn't it good, so good
Wasn't it good
Wasn't it good, so good

Wasn't it good
Wasn't it good, so good

Was it was it really good
You love it didn't you lover
God I'm so, ooh, shoot
Am I good?

Did you love it, did you want it
Can you dig it, baby, baby, so good

Wasn't it good
Wasn't it good, so good
Wasn't it good
Wasn't it good, so good

You're telling every one
You're moment's come
And you've found what
You've been looking for

You said the only word

You never will be lonely anymore
You got a pretty rainbow all your own
And at last you found your pot of gold

And that you care enough
To give your very best

Means happiness

Higher than an eagle dares to fly
If you took every thing you've heard
And try to make a magic word
You'll find you said it all

Cher,"She left her neighborhood
In which everyone was filthy rich
She left her parent's home
And strained with a vagabond
Who made piles of love she never heard
And she believed his every word

She left no forwarding address
Just took her youth and happiness
As with the boy she vanished in
The secret sweetness of their sin

Oh, young girl
Oh, young girl of sixteen
Child of spring-time
Still green
Lying there by the road

He told her, ""love demanded space""
So they roamed from place to place
Although she realized she'd sinned
She grew caution to the wind
As she followed him around
While he slowly dragged her down

So overpowering was her love
The it had made a captive of
The young girl's heart and soul and mind
In other words: love drove her blind

Oh, young girl
Oh, young girl of sixteen
Child of spring-time
Still green
Laying there by the road

Too much emotion for a girl
She let her heart become her world
What world that God has never rocked
For a sunder we are taught
Had she been wise and she'd have known
She could feed him love alone

She should of known the day would come
When he would quit her just for crumbs
He needed fresh young meat to love
And left her heart and mind to starve

Oh, young girl
Oh, young girl of sixteen
Child of spring-time
Still green
Lying there by the road",A Young Girl

Go if you must go
You won't see me down on my knees
Begging you to come back home

'Cause I refuse to give you the right
To cause these eyes to cry at night
I'm well prepared to live my life
Without you

When you walk away
You won't walk away with my heart
There will be no tears in the dark
No crying, no dying
No waiting for you to come back

When you're out the door
That don't mean I won't breathe no more
And I will not beg you to stay
When you walk, when you walk
When you walk away, when you walk away

This heart won't stop beating
'Cause you said goodbye
And you won't see me fall all in pieces
Or break all apart inside

And I will lose not one night of sleep
Crying for what couldn't be
I'm well prepared to never think
About you

When you walk away
You won't walk away with my heart
There will be no tears in the dark
No crying, no dying
No praying for you to come back

When you're out the door
That don't mean I won't mean I won't breathe no more

I must stand
Even when I'm running
And it feels, like a dream
I need to awaken from

I believe
When it hurts
We must keep on trying
But I want, and I need
Like a river needs the rain
There's a bridge I need to burn before I leave
I just want to breathe again
Like a summer's day I need to feel the heat again

I only want to keep the stone from rolling
I only want to learn to feel the rain
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling
I only want to learn to freeze the flame
I know I'll be alive again
I want to be alive again

Here's the night, where are the stars 'cause I need some guiding
And it cuts like a knife as I watch you walk away

There's a bridge I need to burn before I leave
I just want to live again
Like a stormy rain I need to hear it beat again

I only want to keep the stone from rolling
I only want to learn to feel the rain
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling
I only want to learn to freeze the flame
I know I'll be alive again
I want to be alive again
I want to be alive again

'Cause I did my best
Baby who'd have guessed that I failed the test
'Cause when love ain't blessed and it's laid to rest it can leave a mess

I only want to keep the stone from rolling
I only want to learn to feel the rain
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from falling
I only want to learn to freeze the flame

I only want to learn to feel the rain

Would it be so strange
I can't believe that I am alone in saying
The things I'm saying
I am a part of you

These are universal truths
We're all part of the light that flows through everything
This is a different kind of love song
Dedicated to everyone
Different kind of love song-oh,oh
What if the world calmed down and we could all breath
Together easily
Connecting the sky and the ground with you and me
And everything in between
I am part of you

We have living proof
There is some kind of light that flows through everything

I know I'm not alone
I should not be afraid
'Cause I hear your voice
And I know you're there beside me

And so I give my heart
I live to love again
But I can't let go
Of the way I feel about you

Love is a lonely place without you
I miss you and you're almost here
And I'm almost touching you
Love is a place I have to hide away
I'll never love this way again, again

If love was ever true
I know it was with you
'Cause you touch my soul
And you stay with me forever

No tears, no sad goodbyes
There are no reasons why
But I'm holding on
I believe in love eternal

Love is a lonely place without you
I miss you and you're almost here
And I'm almost touching you
Love is a place I have to hide away
I'll never love this way again

Though I'm moving on
I'm still holding on, holding on, holding on

Love is a lonely place without you
I miss you and you're almost here
And I'm almost touching you
Love is a place I have to hide away
I'll never love this way again, again

Love is a lonely place, a lonely place

Cher,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Jolson Medley: Sonny Boy/My Mammy/Rock a Bye Your Baby

And I'm so blue what'll I do
What'll I do when I am wondering
Who is kissing you
What'll I do

To tell my troubles to
When I am alone

Waiting here for time, to play the game
Let love steal us away.

Baby here I am, holding charts
To guide us through the storm,

Many lessons, learned--Oh Baby.
From a past, that's live too many lies.
Yesterday is gone forever--Oh Baby,
All that I can see--
 
You and I living together
Just, you and I groovin' forever--

Trusting every word, 
Just to mean, what has been handed down,
In time.
We've known hurt before.

Masters of my dreams, 
Create a place to feel this love of mine--
And never hurt no more--

You and I living together
Just, you and I groovin' forever--

For showing us the stars.
We must trust the rain, 
And open up our hearts.

Bang bang, that awful sound 
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Bang bang, I used to shoot you down

My mama used to dance for the money they'd throw
Papa would do whatever he could

We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsys, tramps, and thieves
But every night all the men would come around
And lay their money down

Picked up a boy just south of
Mobile Gave him a ride, filled him with a hot meal I was sixteen, he was twenty-one
Rode with us to Memphis
And papa woulda shot him if he knew what he'd done

Gypsys, tramps, and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town
They'd call us gypsys, tramps, and thieves
But every night all the men would come around

I never had schoolin' but he taught me well
With his smooth southern style
Three months later I'm a gal in trouble
And I haven't seen him for a while, uh-huh I haven't seen him for a while, uh-huh

And loving you is all I ask, honey
All I ever need is you
Winters come and they go, and we watch the melting snow
Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you
Some men follow rainbows, I am told
Some men search for silver some for gold
I have found my treasure in your soul, honey
All I ever need is you
Without love I'd never find the way
Through ups and downs of every single day
I won't sleep at night until you say, my honey

I'm on the loose, you're in my sights
You know it's gonna hurt you
But it's just no use
You fall in love, they always do
And I'm waiting for the next one to fall

I'm dressed to kill and you know that I will
We're dancing in the dark with my hand's around your heart
Our heads will roll and blood will spill
But how can you resist
When baby I'am dressed to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill.

Another lover struggles but it's all in vein
You wear the scars and lipstick stains
And he can't even see he's just another one
It's far too late
He's too far gone.
And I'm waiting for the next one to fall...

I'm dressed to kill and you know that I will
We're dancing in the dark with my hand's around your heart
Our heads will roll and blood will spill
But how can you resist
When baby I'am dressed to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill.
How can you resist
When baby I'am dressed to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill.

You know I'm the only one
I can make you come undone
You be a part of me, from now until eternity

I'm dressed to kill and you know that I will
We're dancing in the dark with my hand's around your heart
Our heads will roll and blood will spill
But how can you resist
When baby I'am dressed to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill.

Why do we feel we're going nowhere
Unless we're falling
We're not ready to give up until we're crawling
Don't make it easy on ourselves

Climbing
Risk it all if you ain't living you're surviving
Tell me why you tip your toes when you could dive in
Don't be scared to hurt yourself

Take your heart back off the shelf

Love covers you up in a landslide
Love pulls you under like a riptide
Love's when you crash trying to hang glide
Love's when you run and then there's no light

Love is a sword when you've got no defense
Love is the rock we throw ourselves against
Love is the healing of a broken heart
The story behind all of my favorite scars
Oh, all of my favorite scars
All of my favorite scars
Oh, all of my favorite scars

High-wire
Don't look down, because below you is a raging fire
But love is waiting for you on the other side
We're not easy on ourselves

So take your heart back off the shelf

Love covers you up in a landslide
Love pulls you under like a riptide
Love's when you crash trying to hang glide
Love's when you run and then there's no light

Rain keeps coming down
I just thought I'd try to call you
For you got too far outta town
And I hope that you get this message that I'm leaving for you
'Cause I'd hate that you left without hearing the words that I needed you to

And I hope you find it
What you're looking for
I hope it's everything you dreamed your life could be
And so much more

And I hope you're happy, wherever you are
I wanted you to know that
And nothing's gonna change that
I hope you find it

Am I supposed to hang around and wait forever?
Last words that I said
But that was nothing but a broken heart talking, darling
You know it wasn't what I meant
Call me up, let me know that you got this message that I'm leaving for you
'Cause I'd hate that you left without hearing the words that I needed you to

Cher,"There's a poet in me that remembers
And there's an honesty in every word
There's a dancer that feels her own beat
And there's a daughter who loves

There's a sinner in my bones
And there's a joker in my head
There are secrets in my soul
And there are sorries that I have never said

But there's a time to dance
Time to laugh
Time to cry
Time to go
Time to grieve
Time to come

Oh, I still got time to cope
Time to hope
Time to play
Time to grow
But for now I gotta walk alone
I gotta walk alone

There's a tight rope that I've been walking
There's a daisy in my hair
There's a heartbreak that has taught me
Of what is raging
And there's only love and fear

There's a sadness in my confessions
There's a hyena howling at the moon
And there's a gypsy in me that keeps on roaming
And there's a an anger as I get closer to the truth

But there's a time to dance
Time to laugh
Time to cry
Time to go
Time to grieve
Time to come

Oh, I still got time to cope
Time to hope

I gotta walk alone
I gotta walk alone
I've got to walk alone

A soldier marches through the wrong side of town
I'm gonna love you until I bleed

I gotta walk alone

Oh, fuck, just lie to me
Tell me something sweet
Till I look the other way
Don't wanna start over babe
Already gave you everything
I got nothing left of me

Here it comes now, you're gonna stab me in the heart
I'm gonna hold my ears, so I can't hear us fall apart
Oh, I'm just a little broken down, trying to keep myself alive
So don't kill me
Don't kill me

Neither one of us is pure enough to come clean

I'd rather you lie to me
And look me dead in the eyes
Tell me I'm the one you need
I don't wanna start over babe
This was my everything
You were my last chance, you see
Truth is overrated to me

Is this all common now?
Where's that fairytale that sold us out?
Oh, do you really think you're the only one with secrets now?
See, you're like me
You're just like me

The kind of power to bring a rich man to his knees

I offer you this
But it comes with a price
A moments pain for such a trifle sacrifice

I can show you worlds no human eyes have seen
I can show you worlds beyond all reasoning

Surrender to me now
And we'll be lovers for all time
Angels and sublime
We'll be lovers forever

We'll live just like gods
Reaching every desire
We'll savor ecstasy with every kiss of fire

Than mere words can express
And many mortals who have drained their souls for less

With one gesture you'll be mine eternally

Just can't dream nothing else
All I see is red, now
I'm drowning, no one can help

Sirens through my head, everything you said
Floating lost at sea with sharks around our bed
Wish I heard the call when it was the end
Warnings filled the air but it was too late to pretend
We were living in black and white
Under the grayest sky
Since we've been over, it won't stop

All I see is red, now
Just can't dream nothing else
All I see is red, now
I'm drowning no one can help
It's all around me
Red from my heart, red like my blood
Red from my lips when you told me you were done
Red, now
All I see is red now

Used to be that you were every color of my life
A rainbow shining through the rain, cutting like a knife
You were my obsession every night and every day
So when we fell apart the blue was more than I could take
We were living in black and white
Under the grayest sky
Since we've been over, it won't stop

All I see is red, red
All I see is red, red
It's all around me
Red from my heart, red like my blood
Red from my lips when you told me you were done

The river so deep and the sky perfect blue
If we leave behind the dust in the sky
From the sound of sirens the city will rise
Hold your hand in mine, we'll swim against the tide
From the sound of sirens love will survive

And when your heart is on the run
When it's chains have come undone
I will always be the one to carry you home

Streets lie so empty, the lost avenues
The lights of Saint Vincent are too much to lose
If we leave behind the dust in the sky
From the sound of sirens the city will rise
Hold your hand in mine, we'll swim against the tide
From the sound of sirens love will survive

And when your heart is on the run

You gotta take it like a man
Before you fight for us
You gotta show me that you can

I didn't learn how to fly without a heavy fall
I went from A to Z, blew off reality
So if my love is a game then you should learn the rules
You take it on if you're leaving wonder why you lose
It takes a wiser man to figure out my head

I've been in love, went to the other side
I've seen the other side
I'm not about to fall into another tonight
So get it right

Boy, if you want my heart
You gotta take it like a man
Before you fight for us
You gotta show me that you can
So when the lights go dark
I wanna know you understand
That if you want my heart
You gotta take it like a man

I've seen and done it all
I've been misunderstood
But tell me what could be bad about feeling good
It's all or nothing now
'Cause fate don't wait around

I've been in love, went to the other side
I've seen the other side
I'm not about to fall into another tonight
So get it right

Boy, if you want my heart
You gotta take it like a man
Before you fight for us
You gotta show me that you can

So when the lights go dark
I wanna know you understand
That if you want my heart
You gotta take it like a man

Sometimes it feels
Like we've got everything to prove
We make believe
But we rise again to face the truth

On and on, on and on we're going
On and on, on and on it's growing
On and on, on and on only the real
Know the deal

Boy, if you want my heart
You gotta take it like a man
Before you fight for us
You gotta show me that you can

So when the lights go dark
I wanna know you understand
That if you want my heart
You gotta take it like a man

How does it feel? We do it better!
So get the love that's in your heart
How does it feel? We do it better!
We do it better!

How does it feel? We do it better!
So get the love that's in your heart
How does it feel? We do it better!

With all that's in my power
I was used and abused
Til I was sweet and sour

I kissed you, I kissed you
And gave you all my sugar
You knew that I'd be useless
If I let you know what you were to me
I thought it would be OK
We shared everything, No way

And I knew it, I knew that
You'd turn out to be a sad case
You said you could save me
I'm doing the saving
Went to sleep a superhero
And he woke up a villain
Killin' and killin' my love

Oh no, what happened?

Oh no, don't know what happened.
Don't know what happened

I keep trying and trying
To wrap my head around it
Crying so can't let nobody see how I'm acting
You hurt me, you hurt me
And no not physically
Ain't got no bumps and bruises
To show people what you're doing to me

I thought it would be OK
But you see I heard everything you said
And I knew it, I knew that you'd turn out to be a sad case
You said you could save me I'm doing the saving

Using all my Kung Fu tricks, tricks
Hit 'em with the round house kick to the tempo
1, 2, 3, 4 hung hi ho, T.K.O, Tae Kwon Do
You know, When you see that hand go chop
Everything stops The flow so hot
Like steam from a coffee pot

Rush hour, no traffic
No Jet Li, just Jackie
You acting like you stay behind
Go read up on your classics
You ol' fake-o wanna be superman
Give Clark Kent back his glasses
Man I hit you with a judo kick so fast
You look back like what happened

Cher Lloyd,"What if daddy was right?
What if there's no forever?
Would you kiss me goodnight?
So that I could remember?

Keep you frozen in time
Like they do in the pictures
And if I close my eyes,
Would I still think of patience?

Stay with me, don't disappear
To tell the truth, I need you here
I'm afraid, I can barely breath
I need your words, to comfort me
Say goodnight, would you say goodnight?

What if daddy was right?
And I knew all the answers?
But they could give me the world
But that wouldn't matter
And if the gates open wide, and make you an angel
Two tears in my eyes,
I'd save you're seat at the table

One mistake it's all it really takes

Run away, don't need you anyway
Although I wish you'd stay

To take my breath away
Go on put the knife in

I'll be crying you'll be screaming,
We'll come tumbling down
Just thought you and I
Weren't another face in the crowd?
I'd rather wake up in an empty house than this battleground
I'm on my own now, I'm on my own now

You'll be sorry, I won't worry
I'm ok, better now
Just remember what you did and how it didn't work out
I'd rather wake up feeling empty (caused from this point on?)

On the way uptown if the ball get loose
Tearin' through the blocks, tearin' of the tops
Sun all in your face and it's glarin' of my rocks
I had to ask her how she felt, said let's ride she ain't strap on a seatbelt
I stay fly, fitted cap with a mean belt thats the thug shit that's makin' her knees melt

Such a silly game to play
To eventually just lose to you

Can I get another chance to hold you tonight
Dance on my left and things feel so right
Hold you boy with all of my might
Just don't let you slip away
I pour my heart out to you from now to daylight
So you could know hurting you was never my right
I'm trying to see what's in the cards for tonight
Boy accept this as my plea

I love you
I love you
I love you (Hey, hey)
So don't break my heart

I felt a weight lift from my chest
Now that you know just how I feel
I held it in for far to long
I couldn't tell if this was real

I never thought I'd understand
How it feels to be hurt and to love again (Oh, no, no)
You made it possible for me
That's why I'll give you anything

Can I get another chance to hold you tonight
Dance on my left and things feel so right
Hold you boy with all of my might
Just don't let you slip away
I pour my heart out to you from now to daylight
So you could know hurting you was never my right

Just like the stars in the sky
You brought light to my life
That's why I love you
Just don't break my heart

Without you by my side
I was wasting my time
But now I love you
Just don't break my heart

Look, I think she love me (love me) I think she love me not(not)
Anywhere I touch her turn to a hot spot
Look into my eyes tell me what you see A grade A hustla, a certified G

The way you treat me
Is like a special kind of loving
It's all just a little too good
Too good to be true

And I wonder 
Is okay to trust ya
'Cause baby I come from a different place
Where causing pain, means I love ya

And I was thinking
Maybe I should run by
I can't even find
'Cause boy you got me like, ooh

I don't know what to do (heck ya)

You'll have me crying

I just got in from working
And you're already here waiting
Waiting on me

Greeting me at the door
With hugs & kisses
And I know I smell something
Something cookin' in the kitchen
Baby what is this?
I know this ain't for nothing
Baby, you done did somethin'

Rocks my body all night

Or make it slow down
Give it to you anyway you like

[Verse 2]
I wanna lay you down and take off
All of your clothes
Come let me undress you baby
Caress my body and kiss me from
Head to toe
Then whisper ""You're so sexy, baby""
Don't be afraid to touch me wherever you like
Let your fingers do the talking baby
See your lips go from my neck down to the small of my spine
You bout to drive me all crazy!

Now come get it boy,
Been waiting for too long for you to do that thing that I want you to do to me

When you go away

Hours, minutes, seconds
Oh, I'm still here waiting on you

The feeling you give me
When you hold me in your arms
I wish I had that feeling right now
My skin still smells of your cologne
Remember when I had your body right here, oh

As I lay here in a daze
Thinking all about the love we made
Really the night to turn to day
Just want to hold to you

Even as I go about my busy day
Back of my mind can't get you out of, no, no baby  
Stolen moments fantasizing about your touch
I should be focussed but you're in my head
It's too much (too much)

Now I'm all in a daze
Thinking 'bout the love we're going to make
Should have left my emotions in the bed

Confusion is nothing new

Time after

Sometime you pictured me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, ""go slow, I fall behind""

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time

If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

Good mornin' sunshine feels like Hollywood
Got lipstick traces of famous Hollywood
And in my school I'm like the legend of Hollywood
Mama says I'm much too good for the neighborhood

Hollywood wish I could
They say I'm too young to dream
But I see your treasures in my magazines
Hollywood wish I could

Good evening moonlight feels like Hollywood
Got the kinda face that would be loved in Hollywood
On my television I get news from Hollywood
Daddy says I'm much too good for the neighborhood

Hollywood wish I could
They say I'm too young to dream
But I see your treasures in my magazines
Hollywood wish I could

Don't want the heartbreak and the pain
Nor the fortune and the fame
All my friends are still in school
The ones I've lost say I'm a fool
Yes, I'm a fool, I'm a fool

Hollywood wish I could
They say I'm too young to dream
But I see your treasures in my magazines

Cherie Lynn,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad;
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

I'd never let you go,

From Memphis to St. Joe,

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Plus he know just how to beat it up.
Can't get enough so he always wanna eat it up.

Cherish,"I'm feeling really unappreciated
You takin' my love for granted, babe
I don't know how much more
I can take from you
You don't do the things you use to do
You don't even say I love you too
And lately I've been feeling
Feeling unappreciated

Woke up this morning and saw your face
And you didn't look the same as yesterday
I got the feeling that you can't seem to see
What you want to be
And lately it ain't been the same at all
When you're here, it's like I'm invisible
I still can't seem to see where I went wrong
Cause I'm feeling

I'm feeling really unappreciated
You takin' my love for granted, babe
I don't know how much more
I can take from you
You don't do the things you use to do
You don't even say I love you too
And lately I've been feeling
Feeling unappreciated

Lately our house is not a home
You come in, take a shower, and then say I'm gone
What am I to do with my heart?
Just leave, but my feet won't move
Today is our anniversary
And you haven't even said two words to me
I'm trying hard to give you another chance
But, oh, baby, I'm feeling

I'm feeling really unappreciated
You takin' my love for granted, babe
I don't know how much more
I can take from you
You don't do the things you use to do
You don't even say I love you too
And lately I've been feeling
Feeling unappreciated

Oh, when I first met you
I thought you was the most perfect man
That I ever seen
I still don't understand why
You treat me like you do
I used to give into your lust
Now I see the truth
Oh, no, I don't want to hear it all though
Yeah, I know I'll still be missing you
And it's not worth the pain
That came from you
You made me feel
Unappreciated

I'm feeling really unappreciated
You takin' my love for granted, babe
I don't know how much more
I can take from you
You don't do the things you use to do
You don't even say I love you too
And lately I've been feeling
Feeling unappreciated

Don't love me no more
Hey, woo, hoo

Really wish I could.

If only someone could un-break my heart
Come relieve my pain
Somehow I could wish upon a star
And make all of the memories go away,

But my mind just keeps on going back

That guy that's gon' make me miss out on you
And I can't help but remember
'bout that sad day in September
That day he took my heart with him when he left.
Oh

See eventually I will get through this,
But right now it seems my heart's in the way.

Lights dimmed.
Candles lit.
Your car pulls up.
And then you walk in.
I can see the look on your face.
I know you 'bout to ruin my day.
Then you get to spittin' lines.
Something like this comes a time.
Blood rush to my head.
I start shaking.
Right now my heart is aching.

(Thump, thump, thump)
That's when you said and my heart thumped to a thousand beats a second.
(Thump, thump, thump)
Gotta catch my breath.
(Ha, ha)
Cause there's nothing left.
(Thump, thump, thump)
All these years that I've been down.
How you gonna leave me now?
All that's left is regret.
Wish I never met you.
Can't believe I was a fool.

[Chorus]
You got my heart beating like a drum.
Tell me where did this come from?
Thinking that I'm a have your baby.
Now you're telling me something crazy.
What am I suppose to do?
How do I live without you?
Can't believe you're saying that we're done.

Now I'm sitting here so confused.
Thinking 'bout what the hell I'm gone do.
How can I live without your love?
My body's yearning for you touch.
Thought you said I would be your wife.
Ride or die.
Me and you for life.
Forever you and I.
I was thinking, now our ship is sinking.

I still can't see how, how I couldn't see the signs.
And how I wasn't warned.
Why the only man I ever loved would break my heart?
Tell me where do I go from here?
And how do I move on?
You're the only thing I've known.
Baby, your house is my home.
How could I lose you?
I won't go.
I refuse to.
Cause I can't stop thinking 'bout you.
Dreaming 'bout you.
See, how could I ever live without you?
Seems like the right words are hard to find.
To help you change your mind.
For you baby, I'll fight.
Cause I need you in my life.

But I, I still can't wish you well.

To the bonny pier of Lieth
And bleak it was to gang there
With a snowstorm in your teeth
And aye, the wind blew sharp and strong
And a tear rose in my eyne
I gang there to see my love embark for Germany

As I gazed over the cruel, cruel sea
For as long as could be seen
The wee small sails upon the ship
My own true love was in
And aye, the wind blew sharp and strong
And the ship sailed speedily
Cruel the raging wars have torn my bonny boy from me

Woe be to the orders
That took my love away
And woe be to the cruel cause
That bid my tears to fall
Woe be to the bloody wars of high Germany
They have taken my love and left a broken heart to me",High Germany
Cherish the Ladies,"I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made.
Nine bean rows will I have there, and a hive for the honeybee,
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.

And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,
Dropping from the veils of morning to where the cricket sings;
The midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,
And evening full of the linnet’s wings.

I will arise and go now, for always night and day
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements gray,
I hear it in the deep heart’s core.

Cherish the Ladies,"An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

My brother's lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa, I don't think I said I love you near enough

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band
I am a living legacy to the leader of the band",Leader of the Band
Cherish the Ladies,"I am a freeborn man of the traveling people
Got no fixed abode, were no man is your master
Country lanes and byways where always my ways
I Never fancied being lumbered

In the open field you could stop and linger
And the small birds sang when wintertime was over
Then you'd pack your load and be on the road
They were good old times for the rover

Sometimes we'd meet up with other people
Hear the news or else swap family information
At the country fairs, we'd be meeting there
All the peoples of the traveling nation

I made willow creels and the heather besom 
and I've even done some begging and some hawking
And I've lain there spent wrapped up in my tent 
and I've listened to the old folk talking

All you freeborn men of the traveling people
Every tinker, rolling stone, or gypsy rover
Winds of change are blowing, old ways are going
Your traveling days will soon be over

I am a freeborn man of the traveling people
Got no fixed abode, where no man is your master
Country lanes and byways were always my ways
I Never fancied going faster

Cherish the Ladies,"Come all ye fair and tender ladies
Take warning how you court your men
They're like a star on a cloudy morning
First they'll appear and then they're gone

They'll tell to you some loving story
They'll swear to you their love is true
Straight way they'll go and court another
And that's the love that they had for you

Oh don't you remember our days of courting
You told me that you would love me the best
You could make me believe by the fall of your eyes
That the sun rose in the west

If I had known before I courted
That love was such a killing thing
I'd lock my heart in a box of golden
And fasten it with a silver pin

I wish I was a little sparrow
And I had wings and I could fly
I'd fly right home to my false true lover
And when he'd ask, I would deny

But I am not some little sparrow
I've no wings and I can't fly
So I'll stay right here with my grief and sorrow
And let my life pass me by

Cherish the Ladies,"I met my girl at Woolwich Pier beneath the big crane standing
And all the love I felt for her it passed all understanding
Took her sailing on the river, flow sweet river flow
London town was mine to give her, sweet Thames flow softly
Made the Thames into a crown, flow sweet river flow
Made a brooch of Silver town, sweet Thames flow softly

At London Yard I held her hand, at Blackwell Point I faced her
At the Isle of Dogs I kissed her mouth and tenderly embraced her
Heard the bells of Greenwich ringing, flow sweet river flow
All the time my heart was singing, sweet Thames flow softly
Limehouse Reach I gave her there, flow sweet river flow
As a ribbon for her hair, sweet Thames flow softly

From Putney Bridge to Nine Elms Reach we cheek to cheek were dancing
A necklace made of London Bridge her beauty was enhancing
Kissed her once again at Wapping, flow sweet river flow
After that there was no stopping, sweet Thames flow softly
Gave her Hampton Court to twist, flow sweet river flow
Into a bracelet for her wrist, sweet Thames flow softly

But now, alas, the tide has changed, my love she has gone from me
And winter's frost has touched my heart and put a blight upon me
Creeping fog is on the river, flow sweet river flow
Sun and moon and stars gone with her, sweet Thames flow softly
Swift the Thames runs to the sea, flow sweet river flow
Bearing ships and part of me, sweet Thames flow softly",Sweet Thames Flow Softly
Cherokee,"Nobody said it would be easy
Nobody gives you guarantees
'Cause a heart can always be broken
And there can be no loving without tears

Runaway to a place where nobody knows
Runaway gotta let this feeling go
Runaway if I can't find love,
I'm gonna runaway

Nobody's looking for perfection
How could they give it in return
But I told my heart to believe you
And you just gave your love to anyone

Though my heart is always aching

For coffee and something to eat
Pushed a shopping cart all filled with junk and empty cans
He came home from the war to find his wife

like you're pissin off the maggots

Be the lake below the glacier
Be as clear with self control then
Heave let the effort stretch you higher
May you dare to live your epic
And may it forge you in its fire then
Dream, fall in love with the unknown
But get your boots right on the gravel
and struggle cheerfully alone then
Breathe take your shadow off of the wall... take your shadow off the wall
Can you breathe really breathe?

all covered in roses

Watchin the bees go plant to plant

while the floating falcon screams

Your garden dirt has gotten soft and warm
And my every shovel fills like cream

He hasn’t quite mastered tyin’ his tie on
The way his sweet Sarah used to

It’s been years since he’s talked to the good Lord
He’s not sure he even knows how
But he won’t be mowin’ the front yard today
He goes to church on Sundays now

No, he don’t know the words to ‘The Old Rugged Cross’
But he sings them the best that he can
‘Cause he knows that his angel is up there in Heaven
And he sure wants to see her again

For thirty-one years they were married
She never could get him to go
Now he’s up bright and early
There by 9:30 and sits on the very front row

And he bows his head with the members
And he shouts Amen good and loud
If only his Sarah could see him today
He goes to church on Sundays now

No, he don’t know the words to ‘The Old Rugged Cross’
But he sings them the best that he can
‘Cause he knows that his angel is up there in Heaven
And he sure wants to see her again

His kids can’t believe how he’s changin’
They tell him their mama’d be proud
And he’s always askin’ them all to go with him

But treasures on earth are empty and cold

When I get to Heaven all the angels will sing
And there I will dwell in the mansions of kings

Spring on the wind covered prairie the morning dove sings

Chery X,"Last night you were so into it
You told me secrets that
You've never told a soul
You were so nervous and
Yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine
As you tasted mine
I kissed your lips
You felt my body slip
Into your soul
I heard you moan
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you
Last night, there was no planning it
It was so special and
So very innocent
We talked of memories
Our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love
And deep into the night
Right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight
In you soul
You felt incredible
I started to explode
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you
Sunlight, red roses
The scent of you, it calms the heart
The sight of you, I fall apart
Moonlight, the things we notice
When we're in love, that's when it comes
And I'm so in love, I'm so in love

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing

Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I have it today and give back tomorrow

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Today the world is old

Ages ago last night?

On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

But you sit there with a decrease on 
What with women all pretty with the nitty and gritty 
That's the only way your gonna be sitting pretty 
You need to aim for the top to reach the top 
Yeah I preach a lot but I believe a lot 
And if you believe your not 
Then I should put a laugh on a lad 
Just to get what I want and guess what 

Sometimes life's unfair 
Don't you let them stop you though 
I've been right were you are before 
Are before 
I've don't let no one stop you though 
Happiness is for everyone 
Everyone is for everyone",Everyone
Cheryl Cole,"Turn the lights out, in the light house,
I saw you coming,
Felt the ship wreck
Saw the wreckage, I heard you yelling,
Just a mess when I saw your reflection in the sand,
Wondering where you were washed up,
Or I ran to the water, mmmmm,
I can put my hands down in it,
But I won't bring nothing up,
Sitting at the shore all day, waiting on the tide to come

But you can't hold on to water,
It fills you up but never stays,
It's only good to wash away,
Today and your loving me like water,
You're slipping through my fingers touch,
Natural disaster love, bringing on the flood,
The flood,
Love me like a flood, the flood,
Bring it on,

Stay the night out, by the beach house,
It's oh so quiet,
Lit a candle,
By the window, so you might find it,
Hope you know you'll always have a place to call your home,
Still I can't help but think I could have saved you from drowning,
Ohhh, oh,
I can put my hands down in it, yeah,
But I won't bring nothing up,

Sitting on the shore all day
Just waiting on the tide to come,

But you can't hold on to water,

You're slipping through my fingers touch,
Natural disaster love, bringing on the flood,
The flood,
Love me like a flood, the flood,
Bring it on,

I knew the waves were icy, when I felt them all retreating,
Went to take a dive in the deep end,
Oh, what was I thinking?

But you can't hold on to water,
It fills you up but never stays,

Running in circles
Holding onto your coat tails
Cupids been busy
Shooting his arrows
While I follow the love trail
They led me straight to you
And all I had to do
Was look in my tracks
And double back
I turn around and look what I found

All this time I've been running in circles
You were right behind
I guess I could've met you in the middle
How come it never crossed my mind?

Humming birds around my head
Humming birds around my head
I ran into your arms
Wound up dizzy instead
Now I got butterflies, blue jays 
Pretty things in the air out there
Ever since I found this, been
Humming birds around my head

Hes so tricky yeah
Coming full circle
I always knew how to get there
And he was so picky that
He took his eye off the sparrow
Flew out after the nightingale
And heaven for a while
He took them fast and lost his style ?
Circled his tracks
Double back
Turned around and look what you found

Ever since I found this, been
Humming birds around my head

I got tiny little bee stings on my heart
Where the love blooms
Honey can I only be with you?
Sitting underneath the shade 
Tree in the park where I first met you
Funny how the light can change your view

Oh

Humming birds around my head

Forget the strangers' judgments and mean glares
I always did, what I thought had seemed fair
I walked away saved by the last hair

Not easily, my God I was so scared
Just so you know I can't help that I care
I pray you're well, I just know that I can't I can't

When she's alone she dreams to feel him by her side
Replaying every memory of his voice inside

Fight on

And he knows just what to say (Oh oh oh)
'Cause he gives strength when she needs it
And his heart soaks up the pain

(Fight on) 'Cause he feels her when she feels it
And he knows just what to say (Oh oh oh)
'Cause he gives strength when she needs it
And his heart soaks up the pain

He hears her call
Before she falls
He carries her through every shadow
With just one word
He saves her world
He holds her close before he tells her
Oh, oh, oh

If living without a feeling is really living
Is heaven everything any good
If everything's all you have

I locked myself away
I became untouchable
Got caught up by the day
Dreamin' of blue skies
Nothin' in my way
Just the person in the mirror
Take me to the flame
It's now or never

It's about time that I start loving again
It's about time the sunshine touches my skin
I won't give in 'til my heart beats again
Will somebody show me what I've been missing?
Yeah, it's about time that I start loving again

For all that time I was so scared of flying
So I stuck to the running
But I'm not running anymore
I'm dancing my nights away

Now I'm wide awake
I got my eye on the horizon
Watch me fly away
Into the blue sky
Nothing in my way
Just the person in the mirror

Well you told me go for broke
You go first, I'll hold the rope

Looking for signs through the window

On merely this, a look, a kiss

Could slip away in one little daybreak

Oh, how I dream
I might be like the river wind to you

How I envy a cup that knows your lips
Let it be me, my love
And a table that feels your fingertips
Let it be me, let me be your love
Bring an end to the endless days and nights
Without you

Shares your pillow and watches while you sleep
Its light arrives on tiptoe

Gonna feel alright
If it tears me right in two
'Cause I just can't stay feeling this way
With a heart that's full of you
I'm gonna go right down
To a part of town
Where I've never been before
And in some small place
Find a brand new face
And step out on the floor

And I'll be dancing 'round and 'round
And I'll be satisfied if I can just hold my ground
And if he helps me to keep your memory down
I'll be dancing 'round and 'round

Well you put some distance 'round you
I know I meant to see
There's a space inside for someone
But I know it isn't me
So among the boys who are searching
And the girls who hope they're found
If you look for me, I'm the one you'll see
Who's dancing 'round and 'round

And I'll be dancing 'round and 'round
And I'll be satisfied if I can just hold my ground
And if he helps me to keep your memory down
I'll be dancing 'round and 'round

Come on music, wash my tears away
Come on darkness, cover up the day

And if he helps me to keep your memory down

And someday someway woo I'll meet him

And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above
And being so in love

When he's near me, I'll kiss him,
And when he leaves me woo I'll miss him
Though sometimes we'll fight, I won't really care

How can I ever leave this place beside you?
You were the only one I ever cried to
The night is through

And now it's heartache
I should be home before he sees it's daybreak

I never really meant to stay

And now it's daybreak
We were just sitting and talking
Oh, who would have thought we'd be spending the night
Dreading the light of daybreak?

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.

How tender can you get

Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?

A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

Be, B-Boys and girls, listen up 
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress 
But nothing comes easy it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lina Horn, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person
Gotta astrung when I heard when 
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Coulda died, so young, no looks ugly and old
No fun cause when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath
Cause she smells of corrosion and death 
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how

You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey 
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be 
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and right
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

Be, be, 'fore we came to this country 
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
It was empires in Africa called Kush 
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold when 
Gold was converted to money it all changed 
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded 
They learned about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships 
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went 
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically 
Still goes on today, you see? 
If the truth is told, the youth can grow 
They learn to survive until they gain control 
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young Prince that's when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying ""She's my queen""

And if he don't care she'll get by
Climb into bed bury her head and cry, cry
From the beginning he was all anyone could been
They were delirious with love, they were certain to win
Now he's breaking plans more and more
And he's leaving notes on her door
'took a trip out of town, couldn't turn this one down'
He said 'I guess I should have told you before'

She says she feels like she's addicted to a real bad thing
She's always sitting, waiting wondering if the phone will ring
She knows she bounces like a yo-yo when he pulls her string
It hurts to feel like such a fool
She wants to tell him not to call or come around again
He doesn't need her now at all the way that she needs him
She's on the edge about to fall from leaning out and in
And she don't know which way to move

She wants to be fair, she couldn't say he was ever unkind
But if she could bear to walk away, she thinks he wouldn't mind
'cause he just keeps himself so apart
And there's no one else in her heart
So she's taking a dive from an emotional high
And coming down hard

She's determined to try, but she'll still give in when he gives her a call
And She'll ask herself why, but in the end it won't matter at all
Sure she could sit at home, stay inside
And sleep alone with her pride
And as she walks out her door, she feels as weak as before
With nothing to hide

Trading our dreams so they'd never end

We could close our eyes stretching still folded wings
Waiting for the rain to cool us
Feeling like a couple of foolish young things

Weren't they good times didn't our hearts bind
Didn't we both find something new
Fleeting impressions, timid expressions
Tossed in the tangle of me and you
And if I close my eyes, I can almost see
Moving through those green fields where we used to be
The shadow of a different daydream
Holding in the distance and waiting to breathe

Dusty roads, starry skies
Beating hearts, reluctant eyes, summer rain without a storm
And nervous love behind the barn",Behind the Barn

I dreamed of how you loved, in all your innocence
And I've never known a softer warmer feeling since, or a truer heart
Maybe these dreams are leading me
Maybe love is not as gentle as my memory
Maybe time and wishful half-remembered fantasy are the greatest part

Cheryl Wheeler,"Early mornin' sunrise come and pull the song from me
So I can turn away and rest my tired eyes
I can't escape the haunting of a lonely melody
It runs around and 'round without a compromise

So where you gonna go, what you gonna do?
You know I can't say no, can't say goodbye to you
I can't stop the flow 'til you've decided to

Song runs like a piper, like a drummer through my brain
The silence all around feels so apart from me
I could sit and cry for all the love and all the pain
That brings itself to mind inside a harmony

The softest mornin' light can't shine as soft as you
The sweetest love in sight can't love me like you do
Swiftest bird in flight can't climb the path to you

And now, it's fully dawn and nightly silence breaks away
Into the distant sounds of cars and factories
Traces linger on and slowly fade into the day
And leave me with these rounds all hummin' back to me

So now, I bid you well, take myself to bed
The tune you had to tell was soft and kindly said
I still feel the swell from all you comforted

I never dreamed I'd see the day it fell

Hold your ears tight against the roar

For a meeting of one of his clubs
He would often drive down

Still he'd eat roast beef dinners
And hob-nob with winners
And wait till he hit something big

But before he could get that big fish on the line
They let everyone in and ruined the Shrine
And he was easily riled and likely to shout
Frequently wrong but never in doubt

But he had no family
Till my mother's folks took him in
Just a short blond and wavy
Boy from the navy

How he married Agnes oh I'll never know
She was gracious and gentle
And she loved him so
And he was grand in her eyes
When they would go out
And frequently wrong but never in doubt

And I guess he had a big time
Sharing the secret symbol
With masters elect of the night
Down at the Boumi temple

Well I guess he was crazy
I think he was lonely
My mother was his best friend
He hollered and cried
The day that she died
And I rarely saw him again

In a broken down apartment house
Laid a woman in labor
She said by the grace of God
I'll have this child
And the help of a neighbor
Six o'clock the sun was rising
All upon the world
Seven forty-five the neighbor smiled
And said you got a beautiful girl
She named her Spring
Winter's been a long time passing
She named her Spring
And though she's never been wed
She held her newborn child and said
Ah Spring
I've waited a long long time for you
In a broken down apartment house
Lay a woman dying
By her side a little six year old girl
Who was softly crying
Momma don't go away
And leave me all alone
Momma said to the welfare lady
Find my child a good home
I miss my Spring
Ah winter's been a long time passing
I miss you Spring
The angels came that day
The welfare lady knelt to pray
Ah Spring
She'll be long time gone from you
A beautiful church outside of town
Stands a woman smiling
On her hand is a wedding band
Of fashionable styling
All these years in the orphan's home
He shares with you
Now all your hopes and your childhood dreams
Have all come true
He loves you Spring
Winter's been a long time passing
He needs you Spring
He promised you today
He would never never go away
Ah Spring
He's waited a long long time for you
Long long time for you

Can we still look forward if we can't go back
Am I holdin' you up, holdin' you down

And if I want you and you want me
We'll call it love though it might not be
Hearts on fire, souls in line
Oh, just to know that, just to feel that one more time

Seems impossible to know
What is real and what is just some restless thing
And our hearts learn slow
All the miseries bad choices bring

So is it wise or lazy
Holding tight to what you've known
And is it brave or crazy searching for some

I should certainly be doing something else
And it's selfish to be thinking I'm unworthy

Which looks disgraceful from the things I haven't done

I should learn how to meditate and sow and bake
And dance and paint and sail and make gazpacho
I should turn my attention to repairing
All those forty year old socks there in that bureau

I should let someone teach me to run Windows
And learn French that I can read and write and speak
I should get life in prison for how I treated my parents
From third grade until last week

And I should spend more time playing with my dog
And much less money on this needless junk I buy
And I should send correspondence back to everyone
Who's written, phoned or faxed since junior high

I should sit with a therapist until I understand
The way I felt back in my [Incomprehensible]
I should quit smoking, drinking, eating, thinking
Sleeping, watching TV, writing stupid songs

And I should be less impatient when the line just takes forever
'Cause the two cashiers are talking
And I should see what it's like to get up really early rain or shine
And spend three hours walking

I should know CPR and deep massage and Braille
And sign language and how to change my oil
I should go where the situation's desperate
And build and paint and trudge and tote and toil

And I should chant in impossible positions
Till my legs appear to not have any bones
And I should rant at the cops and politicians
And the corporations in indignant tones

And I should save lots of money to leave Audubon
Plus all the rocks and animals and plants
I should brave possibilities for plotting plums of problems

She's on her own since her husband passed away
Some surgeon screwed up, there's nothing left to say
Now she works this desk at night and the campground by day
in a trailer by the lake until the summer blows away

She read about the job in a camping magazine
and home was just a reminder
So she took the cat and dog, stored away her things,
left the bleakness behind her
Even now through the ache of missing him
she's filled with wonder and far from giving in
She sees magic on the lake in the early morning light
And talking books and telling tales we sat there half the night

I don't want to move somewhere and grow old quietly

We were as blessed as blessed can be
You and Mom and Dad and me
Singin' in 4 part harmony
“I Love To Tell The Story”

Me and my guitar, softball in the yard
Breezeway playin' cards with half of the neighborhood
Their crazy bridge club nights, Sunday back road drives
Running for our lives down into Rhode's woods

And it seemed like something just this side of heaven
Comin' from the AM radio
And it felt like it would just go on forever
Singin “Long Time Man” and “Pretty Peggy-o”

Now we're old and gray, mem'ries fade away
These are here to stay, that is out blessing

“I love to tell the story
‘Twill be my theme in glory
To tell the old, old story
Of Jesus and his love”",Blessed

Out he come, in we go 
Dark, dark, dark 
Blow, blow, blow 
Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain 
Florida to Maine 

Weather channel satellite 
Keep us well informed all night 
Like CNN, ABC 
And every station on TV 

'cause it's a big one, Lord yes 
It's a big one I guess 
And we are deep in trouble 
When all the trees bend double 

Howlin' wind, scary sound

Cheryl Wheeler,"It's the phone, get the phone, there's a phone call 
Fish it out, press the talk button right now 
Anytime, anywhere there's a phone call 
We will answer and start talking real loud 
In their odes to Joy and Jesus, do you think they once foresaw 
Their pieces in our wireless devices 
All across the planet? Blah blah, blah blah, blah

Ah the strains of music all around 
Short little beeps cut through the din 
I've come to love that Motorola sound 
Not harpsichord or violin 
I know Ludwig would be so proud 
That ""Fur Elise"" could beep so loud 
Rossini too and Brahms and Bach 
And Mozart and Rachmaninoff inoff, enough 

Hold the fries- keep your eyes on the road somehow 
Pretty awkward to talk on the phone right now 
To the whims if the Cell Tower Gods I bow 
And I hope the local laws allow 

It's so crowded, you're so loud it's some deaf guy you're talking to

You're impinging, see us cringing, dirty looks aimed at your head 
Not proud of it but I admit I wish your battery was dead",It's the Phone
Cheryl Wheeler,"How can there be trouble in this world? 
With the color in these hills, the blue October sky, 
this little road that winds along the river. 
Dusty barns and tractors in the fields 
And families sit in front yards, or stand outside the churches 
Kids are throwing footballs and pulling carts of pumpkins 
And the morning sun is sparkling on the water 

How can there be such trouble in this world? 
Where the mountains roll so gently, 
Deer graze on the hillsides, birds chat on the phone lines 
The whole wide world's a prayer for Sunday morning 
The geese inspect the stubble in the fields 
And all along the roadside, families stop to wonder 
At the new October morning 
And a red tailed hawk is circling 
And a father hugs his daughter 
And an old man holds the car door for his wife to come and see 
Then they turn and smile at me. 
How can there be such trouble in this world? 

I know of course I know that this is not the only picture 
I don't of course I don't know what to do. 

But the road keeps winding through the afternoon 
And it doesn't know the sorrow or an inkling of the shadow 
of the rage across the water, the hatred and the horror. 
It just wanders through this valley with the river by its side 
As the light fades from the sky 
The beautiful light fades from the sky",Little Road
Cheryl Wheeler,"When we were in love, or whatever it was 
We tore apart their believing hearts 
Just to ride that passion in 

We survived ok, through the mess we made 
But I don't know how we can come back now 
And try to be friends again 

Cause when I see you I can't let the past remain the past 
All that heartache we brought on comes rushing back so fast 
I can't see no road ahead, just pulls me down somehow 
And there's so much water under that bridge, it must be sinking now 

With a shiver and chill, it haunts me still 
What a fool I was to have almost lost 
Most of what's dear to me 

From the very first touch, we took too much 
In the fire we found I was burnin' down 
And just too blind to see 

Cause when I see you I can't let the past remain the past 
All that heartache we brought on comes rushing back so fast 
I can't see no road ahead, just pulls me down somehow 
And there's so much water under that bridge, it must be sinking now 

If we had just held on, maybe once 
Seen beyond our fire 
But our try agains and might have beens 
Were swept away when we were, when we were 

Cause when I see you I can't let the past remain the past

I’m still that nervous 9th grader 
Watching you pull us together, I never knew how

There’s a hole in my life, in my soul, in my heart 
And I stare out this window till light becomes dark 
And there’s nothing that’s touching me now 

But not to complain, we’re just bereft, not deserted 
Lord knows you’re rest was deserved 
It’s just your absence is present in all that I do 
In the sun in the field, in the poem I keep saying 
In the hymn that some church bells were playing 
You have always been part of them but I never knew

Surely you already knew 
What is this world with you gone away? 
How can this finally be true?",Since You've Been Gone
Cheryl Wheeler,"Summer's almost over and I'm crying but I don't know why
Sentimental old fool, weeping for this blue, blue sky
And the way the cat is sleeping and the way the garden grew
Wagging dogs who lick my face and the way I feel for you

Paddling in the kayaks, with my sister, through the quiet creek
Moon upon the water and the river breeze upon my cheek
And the way my father shuffles with his courage and his cane
And the way September bluffs and feints till autumn falls again
Oh summer's almost over and I'm crying but I don't know why

A party for my birthday and a tractor for my 50 years
Swallows at their bird play spin and dive above the new mown fields
And a week in Colorado reading books with my best friend
And the thing I knew I couldn't do and now I know I can

Who could help but welcome autumn and the promise of the winter snow?
Still there's something sweet and wistful as I watch this lovely summer go
But the sun is sinking sooner and the weeds have won at last
With the berries on the bushes and the crickets in the grass
Oh summer's almost over and I'm crying but I don't know why",Summer's Almost Over
Cheryl Wheeler,"Somedays, I can tell
You are holding back the river with a broken dam

This is me who loves you still
And you know I always will
 
Some things never change
You were always just the one I couldn't live without

You close your eyes, and remember what I told you

Better hurry, honey dear, or you'll be missin'
Music sweet, rag-time treat,
Goes right to your head and trickles to your feet,
It's a reminder, a memory finder
Of nights down in old Alabam'.

Hear that flute, it's a beaut,
And the tunes it's tootin', tootsie, ain't they cute?
Let's begin, it's a sin,
To be missin' all this syncopated music!
Oh, you Jane, once again
Give your legs some exercise to that refrain,
Boy, that's what makes me so dreamy and takes me
Back home to my old Alabam'.",Alabama Jubilee

Is a brand new, shiny red Super Stock Dodge

Chet Atkins,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit
",Goofus
Chet Atkins,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

Chet Atkins,"Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin

And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Chet Atkins,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you",Snowbird

Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

Chet Atkins,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee

Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last

Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme

The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine

Chet Atkins,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

Chet Atkins,"A long time forgotten
Are dreams that just fell by the way.
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today.
But she never complains
Of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord.
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

He likes the night life,
The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,
She'll welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him,
But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.

A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

Chet Atkins,"Sails are just like wings 
You can fly from things
Run before the wind
Lord let it blow

Let it rock me slow
While I sleep below
Dreaming dreams
That only sailors know

It will soothe your mind
Smooth away your lines
Set your clock back 
On your own time 
If you sail with me
We will find the sea
We will find our love 
Over again

Chet Atkins,"You know, every time I look in the mirror I see my Dad
I think that's why this song means so much to me

When I was young
My dad would say
""C'mon son, let's go out and play""
Sometimes it seems like yesterday

And I'd climb up the closet shelf
When I was all by myself
Grab his hat and fix the brim
Pretending I was him

No matter, how hard I try
No matter, how many tears I cry
No matter, how many years go by
I still can't say goodbye

He always took care
Of Mom and me
We all cut down a Christmas tree
He always had some time for me

Wind blows through the trees
Street lights, they still shine bright
Most things are the same
But I miss my dad tonight

I walked by a Salvation Army store
Saw a hat like my daddy wore
Tried it on when I walked in
Still trying to be like him

No matter, how hard I try
No matter, how many years go by
No matter, how many tears I cry
I still can't say goodbye

",I Still Can't Say Goodbye
Chet Atkins,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine
Chet Atkins,"You came to me from out of nowhere, you took my heart and found it free,
Wonderful dreams, wonderful schemes from nowhere,
Make every hour as sweet as a flower to me.
If you should go back to your nowhere. leaving me with just a memory,
I'll always wait for your return out of nowhere,
Hoping you bring your love to me",(You Came Along from) Out of Nowhere
Chet Atkins,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues
Chet Atkins,"Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June, 
 We stood beneath an amber moon 
 And softly murmured 'someday soon.' 
 We kissed and clung together, 
 Then, tomorrow was another day 
 The morning found me miles away 
 With still a million things to say; 
 Now, when twilight dims the sky above 
 Recalling thrills of our love, 
 There's one thing I'm certain of 
 Return I will to old Brazil",Brazil
Chet Atkins,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Chet Atkins,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Don't wave don't wink, don't try to tease me with your smile

Now those old memories linger in his mind she's still only ten
And he's still wrapped round her finger like the first time when she smiled at him

When he gave her away at the wedding he paused for a moment and then
He whispered I think now I'm ready when she smiled at him
Now as the years fade into each other he may forget some things now and then
But her face now so much like her mother's carries him back again
To when she smiled at him
Now those old memories linger...
And he's still wrapped round her finger like the first time when she smiled at him",When She Smiled at Him
Chet Atkins,"It began I believe when Adam found Eve he woke up and made her his wife
On that very first day she asked in dismay am I the first girl in your life
Wives don't like old girlfriends you know that's a fact of life
Wives don't like old girlfriends and girlfriends don't like old wives

[Guitar]

Now if you don't lie I'll bet every guy has an old flame that he thinks about
Wives pretend not to care but to her it's as clear as if you were thinking out loud
Wives don't like old girlfriends...

Oh it's an awful sad affair and though it's not there anywhere
Wives don't like old girlfriends...

Chet Atkins,"A diamond is so hard to find you keep searching patiently
You take a stone and make it shine and somehow you bring out the best in me

I count on you to lift me up and sometimes take me down a peg
With a word or just a touch somehow you bring out the best in me
I'm gonna run until I go to distance cause you believe I will
And if I stumble baby what's the difference you're standin' by me still
When there's a path in front of me but I can't find it for the trees
I look at you and clearly see somehow you bring out the best in me

Remembering that spring day, that lonely night.
Let's look up as we walk, count the blurry stars
Remembering that summer day, that lonely night.

Happiness is above the clouds, 
Happiness is above the skies.
Let's look up as we walk, so that the tears don't spill
Crying as we walk, that lonely night.
Remembering that autumn day, that lonely night.

On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know

Chet Atkins,"The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.
That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
Shes everything on this earth to me.

And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me, I want my arms about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through

And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek",Cheek to Cheek

Although the snow covers the hope of spring
Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold

Someday whenever the spring breaks through

You'll come to me out of the long ago
Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow
Lara my own, think of me now and then
God speed my love till you are mine again

Around a golden sun
We are a billion children rolled into one
So when I hear about the hole in the sky
Saltwater wells in my eyes

We climb the highest mountain
We'll make the desert bloom
We're so ingenious we can walk the moon
But when I hear of how the forest have died
Saltwater wells in my eyes

I have lived for love
But now that's not enough
For the world I love is dying   And now I'm crying 
And time is not a friend (no friend of mine)
As friends we're out of time
And it's slowly passing by ....right before our eyes


We light the deepest ocean
Send photographs of Mars
We're so enchanted my how clever we are
Why should one baby feel so hungry she cries
Saltwater wells in my eyes

I have lived for love
But now that's not enough
For the world I love is dying   And now I'm crying 
And time is not a friend (no friend of mine)
As friends we're out of time
And it's slowly passing by ....right before our eyes

We are a rock revolving
Around a golden sun
We are a billion children rolled into one

Chet Atkins,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues

Chet Atkins,"Spring was never waiting for us, girl 
It ran one step ahead 
As we followed in the dance 
Between the parted pages and were pressed 
In love's hot, fevered iron 
Like a striped pair of pants 

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark 
All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain 
I don't think that I can take it 
'Cause it took so long to bake it 
And I'll never have that recipe again 
Oh, no! 

I recall the yellow cotton dress 
Foaming like a wave 
On the ground around your knees 
The birds, like tender babies in your hands 
And the old men playing checkers by the trees 

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark 
All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain 
I don't think that I can take it 
'Cause it took so long to bake it 
And I'll never have that recipe again 
Oh, no! 

There will be another song for me 
For I will sing it 
There will be another dream for me 
Someone will bring it 
I will drink the wine while it is warm 
And never let you catch me looking at the sun 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one 

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it 
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it 
I will have the things that I desire 
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
I'll be thinking of you 
And wondering why

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

All they do is sing and dance
All they got is romance
What a tragedy

Every boulevard has lovers
Every lover's in a trance
The poor people of Paris
I feel sorry for the French

Every guy has got a wench
Every couple's got a bench kissing shamelessly
Night and day they're making music
While they're making love in French

The poor people of Paris
Milk or water from a sink
Make a true Parisian shrink
Wine is all he'll ever drink

And it worries me
For with wine as cheap as water
Oh it makes one stop and think
The poor people of Paris

Sister Madam Pierre
Had the craziest love affair
And the day after they parted there
He cries bitterly

Pierre was there to bid her farewell
But he brought his new girl Claire

Not unless you like to dance
Not unless you want romance

And I don't really care who's to blame
'Cause if love won't fly on its own free will
Its gonna catch that outbound plane

The old folks say loves not forever anymore
Because these young people walk away
From love alone, to pace the floor
Young or old I say that love is still the same
And you may walk away from love
But you'll fall head and heel again

[Chorus]

Two lonely hearts in this aiport knowing
Neither cares where that other heart is going
But if love won't fly on its own free will
Its gonna catch that outbound plane

Hat crown you're wearin'
Is just your halo turned upside down
Where is the laughter we once shared
Back in the lost and found
These broken wings are gonna leave me here
To stand my ground
You can have this ticket
For that lonely plane that's flyin' out

[Chorus]",Outbound Plane
Chet Baker,"Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart

Zing! Went the strings of my heart

What else could I do again?

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling

Chet Baker,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good

When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

sit there and count your fingers, what can you do,
Old girl, you?re through.
Just sit there and count your little fingers, unhappy little
girl blue.
Sit there and count the raindrops falling on you,
It?s time you knew,
All you can count on are the raindrops that fall on little girl
blue.
No use, old girl, you might as well surrender,
Your hopes are getting slender, why won?t somebody send a tender
Blue boy to cheer up little girl blue.

As merry as a carousel,
The circus tent was strung with ever star in the sky,
Above the ring you loved so well.

Chet Baker,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands (You in My Arms)
Chet Baker,"Can't we two go walkin' together out beyond the valley of trees?
Out where there's a hillside of heather curtseyin' gently in the breeze
That's what I'd like to do; see the heather but with you.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder,there's lazy music in the rill,
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.
There may be other days as rich and rare,
There may be other springs as full and fare,
But the won't be the same, they'll come and go
For this I know;
That when the mist is in gloamin'
And all the clouds are holdin' still,
If you're not there I won't go roamin' through the heather on the hill, 
The heather on the hill.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder,there's lazy music in the rill,
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.
There may be other days as rich and rare,
There may be other springs as full and fare,
But the won't be the same, they'll come and go
For this I know;

Chet Baker,"Bed, bed, I couldn't go to bed
My head's too light to try to set it down
Sleep, sleep, I couldn't sleep tonight

But suddenly my words
Reach someone else's ear
At someone else's heart strings too

I tell you my dreams
And while you're listening to me
I suddenly see them come true

I can see us some April night
Looking out across a rollin' farm
Having supper in the candlelight
Walking later, arm in arm

Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

Somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling that any second
You may suddenly appear

Chet Baker,"I dim all the lights and I sink in my chair.
The smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air.
The walls of my room fade away in the blue,
And I'm deep in a dream of you.
The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend;
You come to my arms, may this bliss never end,
For we love anew just as we used to do
When I'm deep in a dream of you.

Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing;
We glide through a lover's refrain, you're so appealing
That I'm soon revealing my love for you over again.
My cigarette burns me, I wake with a start;
My hand isn't hurt, but there's pain in my heart.
Awake or asleep, ev'ry mem'ry I'll keep
Deep in a dream of you.",Deep in a Dream

I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Oh, you crazy moon, what did you do?
And when they kissed, 
They tried to say that it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy moon, look what you've done

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

There they are, they fell in love,

Chet Baker,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet

Things we've been longing to

I try to give a party, and the guy upstairs complains.
I guess I'll go through life, just catching colds and missing trains.

I never miss a thing. I've had the measles and the mumps.
And every time I play an ace, my partner always trumps.
I guess I'm just a fool, who never looks before he jumps.
Everything happens to me.

At first, my heart thought you could break this jinx for me.
That love would turn the trick to end despair.
But now I just can't fool this head that thinks for me.
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air.

I've telegraphed and phoned and sent an air mail special too.
Your answer was goodbye and there was even postage due.
I fell in love just once, and then it had to be with you.

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream

That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet

With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?

Chet Baker,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Chet Baker,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

Chet Baker,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.

Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You
Chet Baker,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

It's a good thing or it's bad,

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful [Take 1]

When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Chet Baker,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

Chet Baker,"The very thought of you
And I forget to do
The little ordinary things
That everyone ought to do

I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a king
And foolish though it may seem to me
That's everything

The mere idea of you
The longing year for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go
Till I'm near to you

I see your face in every flower
Your eye in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you
My love

The mere idea of you
The longing year for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go
Till I'm near to you

I see your face in every flower
Your eye in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you

Chet Baker,"I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard 
For love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled
'Cause I've been fooled in the past
But still I fall in love so easily 
I fall in love too fast
 
My heart should be well schooled

Chet Baker,"Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine

Chet Baker,"This isn't sometimes, this is always
This isn't maybe, this is always
This is love, the real beginning of forever

This isn't just mid summer madness
A passing glow, a moment's gladness
Yes it's love, I knew it on the night we met

You tied a string around my heart
So how can I forget you?
With every kiss I know that this is always

",This Is Always
Chet Baker,"When they met, the way they smiled, I saw that I was through
Oh, you crazy moon, what did you do?
And when they kissed, 
They tried to say that it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy moon, look what you've done

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

There they are, they fell in love, 
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

And there they are, they fell in love, 
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart","Oh, You Crazy Moon"
Chet Baker,"I'm thru with love,
I'll never fall again.
Said I do to love,
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you
Or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

I've locked my heart.
I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.
Emotion.

Did you good by the spring 
And all it meant to me
a good neighbor 
The things that used to be.
For I must have you or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.
That's why I'm thru with love.",I'm Through with Love
Chet Baker,"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be",On Green Dolphin Street/Luscious Loo
