The Boo Radleys,"Keeling at the sink I'm reeling
waiting for the calm that can't be found
I've swallowed all the pills, I'm cold
and the dreams are starting to take hold.

Thinking that this room is sinking
and my God is nowhere to be found
1,2,3,4 (backwards)",Spun Around
The Boo Radleys,"... and I think you know
I think you know my bodyâ??s achinâ??
So take the time to take your time
And feel the power surging through
Let it wash all over you, feel it
Breaking through, try to let it help
You understand
... take what you know
Break it up and re-arrange it.",Take the Time Around
The Boo Radleys,"Just drop me here I can find my way clear back to my house, I'm finding
It hard trying to stay on my feet on
My own I'm thinking of ways I can
Get out of things just like always
With a head full of beer I will try
And tell someone tonight
I gotta get away step on the gas
Go giles! (go, go)
... later
I'll just have one more then I'll have
To be going, someone's waiting
I'll just have one more, it can't do
Any harm anymore, I'm thinking
Of ways I can get out of things
Just like always with a head full of beer
I will try and tell someone tonight",Thinking of Ways
The Boo Radleys,"I don't need you preachin'
Tellin' me points of law
I got my own problems
Trying to stay off the floor

As the vultures circle
And the bills and demands
Fill the floor
It's been 3 weeks and 3 days
Since I last stepped out my door

This is my life too
This is mine

Jesus, this room's so cold
But you've got your own problems
I can't see an end to it all",Upon 9th and Fairchild
The Boo Radleys,"Hey, what's that noise?
Do you remember? 
Kill yourself at work for what seems nothing at all
Then you go home and you cry and you feel so
Very small, so you listen to the Beatles and relax and close your eyes
And you feel it running through you
Feel the hate well up inside

Hey, what's that noise?
Do you remember?
Fashioned by the blade of a world that doesn't care
Feeling so removed, drifting through stealing air then
Pause and think about it, try to move and shift the
Scream and feel alive
Hey! what's that noise?
Do you remember?",The White Noise Revisited
The Boo Radleys,"(...700 hertz)
Ain't that just you
You know the facts, but you
Haven't got a clue
About me or my life, why don't
You try and take the time
Till then what am I supposed
To do? But then that's just 
Like you to leave me
I hang suspended on your
Words, yeah you leave me 
I hang suspended on your words

Don't you care? I don't read
Minds and I did I'd be
Elsewhere, tell me what's on
Your mind so I can rectify in
Time, or else I won't know 
What I'm to do, but then that's
Just like you to leave me

I hang suspended on your words",I Hang Suspended
The Boo Radleys,"Wishin' I was skinny
Wishin' that the whole world knew my name
Wishin' I was thrillin', that I would never be
To blame, wishin' I was kissin' a girl with lips 
Smooth as pearl, wishin' I was pretty, wish that
I could twist the world round my finger, wishin'
I had money wishin' for the time to spend it all,
Wish that I could wrap the world round my finger,
But I would always love you, I guess that would 
Never change.",Wish I Was Skinny
The Boo Radleys,"Where are you going with your suit of armour on
And your back turned to the sun
And your lips tightly sealed
What is this poison that you carry like a curse

I'm your lover not your nurse
But I will wash it away
Wash it away
Don't stay here for me",4am Conversation
The Boo Radleys,You'll never touch the magic if you don't reach out far enough,Charles Bukowski Is Dead
The Boo Radleys,"It's easy to hide behind a smile, behind an ugly grace
It's easy to talk behind the back, it's harder to the face
It's easy to drink than to think, it's all so easy then
It's easy to shy away from life, it's hard to be the man

Oh come on listen to me, I can't complain I got it easy
I've everything I thought I always wanted
Even though I'm keeping busy
there's something more that still escapes me
I had it then, but now it's gone away",Fairfax Scene
The Boo Radleys,"Through all the hurt and the pain
I don't regret a single day
My friends are not the ones who
Tell me who my friends should be
But don't be afraid, you know you make me happy
Remember that

I've found myself in Ladbroke Grove
Things kept within I should resolve
If I could reach backwards 
I wouldn't change a thing
And listen Joel, it won't be easy, it's never easy
Remember this

Don't go with the flow
Try follow your own path

All I want is harmony
Like some outmoded sixties throwback
I don't feel no destiny you make your own luck
if you want it now
I don't regret a single day

Once you get hit so often
you become numb to everything
You find out that you are on your own",Joel
The Boo Radleys,"Get out of bed,
Don't forget what it was you said
Hey boy I hear you callin'
But it's too early morning

The world is waitin' just for you
I know, I know it is
The world is waitin' just for you
Get out of bed,

Don't forget what it was you said
Oh my, I must be dreamin'
My arms and legs are screamin'
The world is waitin' just for you

I know but not today
The world is waitin' just for you
The day that you've been waiting for
You might as well you've nothing left to lose

I know that it's still dark outside
Get out of bed, boy where's your pride
And I know what you want
To take my life have me serve you
But I might as well go
'Cause you need me more than I do","Martin, Doom! It's Seven O'Clock"
The Boo Radleys,"Dead in the water, nothing left
Except the stench of what has gone before
Make some coffee, drink it down
And fix upon the pattern on the wall

I stare at my face,
I know every trace

And I make it hard to get along with me
Bills and heartburn, pills and soaps
And flickin' through the books you've read before
Tears come easy, words come hard
But there really isn't much to say no more

I stare at my face,
I know every trace

And I make it hard to get along with me",Stuck on Amber
The Boo Radleys,"It thinks it's right when it knows it's wrong
It's been like this right from day one
It don't need anyone to be its guide
But it needs someone on its side

And I know that I can't make up my mind
I can feel it there's two of me inside, twinside

Make way for the end of frustration
Make may for the united front
One thought for a new situation

When it gets so it cannot walk
Can't stand up or even talk
Like a secret you cannot hide
It feels it kicking deep inside

And I know that I can't make up my mind
I can feel it there's two of me inside, twinside

Make way for the end of frustration
Make may for the united front
One thought for a new situation

When it feels ready to explode
It just sits quiet without a word
When the right thinks it knows best
The left will go for something else",Twinside
The Boo Radleys,"Could I get much colder
To live somewhere else
In my head and in my heart
Is it to much to forgive

And if I were much wiser 
Maybe I would realize
That it's not where you are
It's who you're with

But maybe it's brighter down there
Maybe it's wilder
Maybe it's brighter down there
Maybe it's wilder

You have seen the worst of me
For that I'm truly sorry
It's not you, it's this place
And not knowing where to turn

Maybe I would be sorry
But I need to find out
I know you don't understand
I can't blame you for that

But maybe it's brighter down there
Maybe it's wilder
maybe it's brighter down there
Maybe it's wilder",Wilder
The Boo Radleys,"He had a ticket
But 
What 
Was 
Weird
They found it in his ear
She gave a fortune to those in need
But her heart was saved for me
Monday is my birthday, Tuesday is her birthday
Blue balloon for you, red balloon for her

Outside the sky is filled with rain
And I'm glad to be home again, oh yeah?

The sky was bullfrog green
Man you would have been amazed
The rain beat up the fields
My mind turned from less fortunate days",Bullfrog Green
The Boo Radleys,"And you know you shouldn't have another cigarette but
Nothing else makes sense, nothing else will recompense
And you get your loneliness out of a magazine you never
Felt nothing at all no-one else will ever know another one
Has dragged you home and sworn that you're the only
One you dream they'll play a special part you'll write their
Name across your heart but then it's back inside your
Head the thought that it will turn out bad a fleeting
Glimpse of what is bound to be now the phone has lost
Its voice you're on your own again spend your time on
Endless bedroom floor soliloquies the only voices you'll
Hear all day will it always be this way (yes) once you
Recognize the truth that all is sad and you're the proof you
Might as well fight the day kick back at the pricks that say
All is school and work no more break your back it's not
Your war disengage the only way to win opened up my
Paintbox it had all turned to blue I worked in Birkenhead
For you it brings me tears even now you tried to kill me
Break my will you almost won I hate you still the hated
Suffer not what's worse the hater carries round the curse it
Eats me up the cancer that is you don't paint blue all the
Time know the truth read the signs live your life as a lie
You don't have to die",Everything Is Sorrow
The Boo Radleys,"You're pretty and you know it
You're stupid and you show it
If there's a soul behind your face at all
I'm struggling to see it

Now smile for the camera
You've got what they're after
Yes it's all you wanted
But it's that has suffer to suffer this

The best clubs in London you'll always be around them
But drinkin' ain't livin' and
Drinkin' ain't givin'

My sister's father had a wife
Whose husband had a father
Who taught me how to live
But died all alone

And I wish that I was with him
I could tell him all the things that he's missed
And all the things that you think
When you think that you're alone

But, man, you can't see what's going on
At the minute you can do nothing wrong
Yes you are a fortunate son
But you won't fool the kids for long",Fortunate Sons
The Boo Radleys,"Leaves everywhere outside your house
Running after you 'cause you walk too fast
And we can't find a cab
Looks like the Northern line again

Remember that time outside your room
Playing with the cat just me and you
It was my favorite time
My world stopped for just an hour

I am the voice 
But not the sound
I can go up 
Yet still be down

And you don't know the places that I've been to
You wouldn't like me if you knew

(What you gonna do when it all breaks down?
What you gonna do when you lose the sound?)
Don't remind me I cannot say
(What happened to the fire that got you through?
The days when nothing went right to you?)

Hey! nothing changed I'm still the same
Hey boy what's the score don't you give a shit 
About yourself no more?
If you don't want me to be real don't look up to me

There are three saints that shaped my life
Alban, Bede and Mary
I've nothing but disrespect for them
And for what they almost made me

Those who taught, taught what they were taught 
and not what they had learned

Sister I can't feel what you feel let me try
Brother lay your arms down and open your eyes
I believe in love (wow!)
Laugh if you must
I don't care...
'Cause I don't dare",Four Saints
The Boo Radleys,"Though you know you have to go
It's much too hard to do
Pack all your things
Though you only have a few
We have got no business here
There's nothing left for us
Get on the bus...

Streets stretch out miles ahead
Half blind wishing I'd come to bed
Where's he? I told him there
On this day at this hour
I don't want to make a scene or cause a fuss
Here it is right on time, it really is a must
Get on the bus

Streets stretch out miles away
As we have this curse place on time
Where next I've no idea
Ask the driver if you care
I don't want to make a scene or cause a fuss
Here it is right on time, it really is a must
Get on the bus

So we proved we're alive
Showed that we can beat time
Another one joins the line of those who've died
But I still see
Yes I still hear
And Oh! what a time we had
Oh! what a time we had...",Get on the Bus
The Boo Radleys,"All my life has been so missable
A goddam crying shame
Eyes to see with ears to hear
While those who're not to blame
Can't do what we take for granted
Trapped in their own heads
I know if it were to happen now
I'd wish that I were dead

I complain about my looks
I feel bad bout my hair
Jesus that's so sad I admit it now
Why should anyone care
Let me be your ears your eyes
Your legs I'm what you need

I can't go on living this life
Wrapped in my own greed

I don't imagine I'll go, you never wanted to
Be that way, I never wanted to be this way

I love the light that shines and the
Sound that's all around
I love the light that shines and the
Sound that's all around

And everyone knows
It's hard to do and say what is right
But that's allright
'cause we've got colours for the blind",Melodies for the Deaf (Colours for the Blind)
The Boo Radleys,"Words don't mean a thing
They tend to be just what is said to get by
Without a sign, of what is in your head
Words alone cannot condone or condemn anyone
Ease your pain or rearrange something that's been done
But what's to say anyway

One last time and then, I couldn't manage
Anymore, I know I should think more about it
I know I should try for one last hurrah",One Last Hurrah
The Boo Radleys,"I remember at school there was always some fool
Teaching us about the past
Pictures of kids, starving, eating out of bins
Man we all had to laugh
It's hard to believe we were told with relief
It couldn't happen now of course 
It's easy to expound with your head in the ground 
I've since learnt that and more

What is there to do I'm alright so are you
But outside there are TB streets
You can cry a lot say Oh! My God!'
But as an action it is incomplete
Put money in the hands of those who understand
Give shelter of the roofless heads
It's hard to deny when you open your eyes
And listen to yourself instead

And you'll think you've gone crazy
But you hope it will pass
It's a sickening feeling maybe it won't last
It shouldn't be happening at this point in time
With these houses standing empty",Shelter
The Boo Radleys,"See'mon kids don't do yourself down
Throw out your arms for a new sound
Pretty face it don't mean a thing
If you look so same as your crowd

Work all day it don't mean a thing
With the sun always outside your window
Fuck the ones who tell you that life
Is merely a time before dying

Look for the box and find what's inside
You'll never find it till you have done
And fuck the ones who tell you that life
Is merely a time before dying

I know it's hard to do
But have we ever let you down
See'mon kids",C'mon Kids
The Boo Radleys,"Summer's gone, day's spent with the grass and sun
I don't mind to pretend I do seems really dumb

I rise as the morning comes
Crawling through the blinds
I shouldn't be up at this time
But I can't sleep with you there by my side

Wake up it's a beautiful morning
The sun shining for your eyes
Wake up it's so beautiful
For what could be the very last time

You have to put the death in everything

The Boomtown Rats,"
Here they go, lying again
Beating everybody at their favourite game
But in the end nobody wins no

Here they go let's pretend the rules have changed but the
Names the same
And in the end nobody wins no

Do you think they don't know what they're doing
Do you think they don't know who they're fooling

When I was a boy and I was told that heaven was hot and hell was cold
If I told lies I'd freeze my soul but it didn't seem to matter

Do you think they don't know what they're doing
Do you think they don't know who they're fooling

There they go lying again
They want it just as much as us
And in the end nobody wins no

There they go lying again
They pulled the wool and we all fell in
And in the end nobody wins no

There they go lying again (you're telling lies)
There they go lying again (you're telling lies)

The Booth Brothers,"God sent his son, they called him Jesus,
He came to love, heal and forgive.
He lived and died to buy my pardon,
An empty grave is there to prove my savior lives.

[Chorus]
Because he lives
I can face tomorrow
Because he lives
All fear is gone
Because i know he holds the future
And life is worth the living
Just because he lives

How sweet to hold a newborn baby,
And feel the pride and joy he gives,
But greater still the calm assurance:
This child can face uncertain day because he lives.

[Chorus]

And then one day I'll cross the river,
I'll fight life's final war with pain.
And then, as death gives way to vict'ry,
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know he reigns.

A prince came along and gave her a golden veil
He said you're a bird of painted glass
And he took her in his grasp

He took her away 
Carried her off in the night
Built her a cage to keep her from taking flight
And when she tried to ask him why
Storm clouds seemed to fill his eyes
He brings the rain down
Look at us now 
I've been wondering how you can live with yourself 
don't you see that your nightingale' s bleeding

The Borrowers,"Late last night I awoke in a dream
To the sound of a voice that was almost a scream
From out of the city and out of the street
Out where the wind hits the cold concrete
It's cold outside
Darkness your enemy
No place to hide
The voice said this to me
In your doorways I have shivered
In your alleys I have gone to ground
But I will be delivered
Someday I will be mercy bound
I dreamed again it was West LA
On a crowded street on a hot summer day
She was alone
Three months late and beginning to show
In a midriff blouse she would soon outgrow
She had no one to call and no way home
And in my mind I knew I'd seen myself
But in our blindness it always seems like someone else
There I was a rag a bone
A remnant in your lost and found
I was for once truly alone
Longing to be mercy bound
And I knew that I would wander
As a child in the forest till they found me
And I called out to them but could not penetrate
The silence all around me
And when I wake I know you'll comfort me
And I won't sleep again for an eternity
But others lie awake at night
In desperation more profound
And the coming of the morning light
Will not see them mercy bound
And some will never dream again
From sleeping on the ground
Longing to belong
And dying to be mercy bound
Oh please don't stop your dreaming
Someday we'll all be mercy bound",Mercy Bound

It's another perfect day
She stops a blind man and she asks him for directions
The she walks the other way
I know when I see her face
Here's such a lonely place for her
She can't help but end up lost before she starts
She's got a nervous heart
On the way down from desire to isolation
I pass her on the street
She seems to know me but I sense her hesitation 
And mistake it for conceit
Oh we can build these walls
Why can't we make them fall
Maybe we just don't know where to start
She's got a nervous heart
Ooh, she could do what she wants with mine
Ooh, she's as sweet as turpentine

And once again I know that ordinary sadness
That keeps us all apart

She's caught me on her line
But she denies me every time

Down between the pillars of your soul

Content to leave me stumbling in the dark

But the songs created in they shacks
Are so wick-wick-wack, situations like this

And your number
And I'll get back to you
Hey how are ya doin
Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you
Check it out

Party at the dug-out on Diction Ave
Haven't been to the jam in quite a while
Figure I'll catch up on the latest styles
'Stead piles and piles of demo tapes bi-da miles
All I wanna do is cut on the decks wild
But edition up here bi-da miles to the center
Reliever of duty, Plug One mosies in
And I be like, ""Yo G, Pos does all the producing""

Now woe is me to the third degree
Mase pulls the funny so I make like a bunny
Jettin'
But I'm getting used to this demo abuse
Getting raped and giving birth to a tape
Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker
Attached to my success, sent like a stalker
Make way to my radius playin fly guy
Try to get on my back they force like Luke Sky
Me Myself and I go through this act daily
And rarely do I not
No matter how I dodge some jackal always nails me
No matter what the plot
And even out on tour they be like
""Yo I got a tape to play you back at the hotel""
I be like ""Oh swell""
Unveil the numeric code to dial my room
And tell them to call me at noon
But of course there's no answering machine in my room
But a pretty young adorer
Who I swung on tour
And if it rings while we're alone
She'll answer the phone
And with the quickness she'll recite like a poem

""Hey, you done did the right thing, dial up my ring ring
Now you're waiting on the beep
Say, I would love if you'd sing
The tune to Tru instead of fronting on the speak""
So no problemo, just play the demo
And at the end it's break out time
Please oh please don't press rewind
Cause I'll just lay it down the line

Hey how ya doing
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

Hey how ya doing
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And we'll get back to you peace","Ring, Ring, Ring"
The Bosshoss,"We jumped onto the van, had this job to do
The other night quite far to go
Put the pedal to the metal, let the engine rattle
Just headin’ for the very next show
We smelled like a bar, hung over in the car
Just tryin’ to get a little bit of sleep
But Russ just said ""Boys it’s beer o’clock""
No quitters on the highway to hell

Let the cigarettes burn, the booze go round
The radio’s playing our favourite sound

Well, the party in the van just started to boil
We still had one hour to got
When a cop-car passed and they pulled us out
And a little fat sucker just started to shout
""We don’t like you kinda folks around here,
So you better hit the road, fuck off""
So we payed our bill, put the pedal to the metal
Did the mooning when we drove off

Let the cigarettes burn, the booze go round

We arrived at the club quite late that night
The whole crowd’s waiting for us to start
We played a rock’n’roll show way out of control
Kicked asses and the girls kept fainting in the first row
The party backstage just blew our heads off
Wished that we could have a day-off
But no way, next gig’s quite far to go
So we hopped into the van, put the pedal to the metal
We smelled like a bar, hung over in the car
Just tryin’ to get a little bit of sleep
But Guss just said ""Boys it’s beer o’clock""
No quitters on the highway to hell

The Bosshoss,"I discovered the King at the age of 6
My daddy bought a tape at the supermarket
Listening to the songs, I tried to sing 'em.
Jumped on my bed and I sure did swing 'em.
I knew it with my heart and soul,
I wanna grow up with rock 'n' roll!
Hey, I'm a big fellow today
Ad I feel it in the same old way

I'm still crazy, crazy 'bout Elvis
Because he amazes me, he gives me the kicks,
I'm still crazy, about the way he sings,
And if I would be a girl, I'd marry him

He was a small town boy with a Tupelo smile
Hanging with the Beale Street rank and file
He rocked my soul with a rebel rhythm
Take me back to '57.
An original pioneer King of rock 'n' roll, had no fear.
I hear his voice on the radio
Jailhouse Rock, oh man - go cat go!

I'm still crazy, crazy 'bout Elvis
Because he amazes me, he gives me the kicks
I'm still crazy, about the way he sings
And if he would still be there, he'd be my teddy bear!

TCB my ABC, the no. 1 rule in rock 'n' roll school,
I'm All Shook Up and Love Me Tender
Hey, nearly made me doubt my gender
Now I know it with my heart and soul
Till I die, I'm gonna dig his rock 'n' roll
So this little song's for everyone
Who wants to sing along like

Crazy, crazy 'bout Elvis
Because he amazes me, he gives me the kicks
I'm still crazy, about the way he sings
You think I am kinda queer - baby, I don't care!

Ten days on the road now I'm four hours from my home town

Far as she's concerned I belong in this Hoosier state
Stuck in Indianapolis with no way to set things straight

If I could catch a ride I really think I'd ditch this van
Who knows what this repair will cost, scared to spend a dime
I'll puke if that jukebox plays John Cougar one more time

If I get that van back, Man, the road I'm gonna burn

On the streets of Kanab
He pointed the way and
Answered the questions I had

Doesn't really exist
It'll send you through a mountain
And out a hole in a cliff

Left Flagstaff in the morning
To make Salt Lake by night
Driving across the moon
Hoping that it's right
Went into a fog
Near the state line
But didn't care much
About losing time

It's true a wrong turn
Can put you in a wrong place
But it could lead to
A way cooler space
You'll never have a bad trip
If you accept
The twists and the turns
That you don't expect

Just out of the hills
Hit something slick
About took a spill
On the plateau
In snow axle deep
Still got to Rock Springs
In time for some sleep

Been a mile high
For nearly a week
But it'll wear off
Under twelve hundred feet
Coming down soon
Traveling I-35
Playing songs and
Glad to be alive

She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti

Moving foward to the next lifetime

Attention is all over town ready to burst open into driving burning exploding sound

If these walls could sing they would sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk they would say they would have seen it coming all along, all along
Tony's making slice pies for the lunch rush stirring the sauce pounding out
The dough his brother left town with his girl she ain't his girl no more

And some days they never seem to end so mundane in this old town
In his home town ready to burst open into driving burning exploding sound.
And If these walls could sing they would sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk they would say

They would have seen it coming all along, all along, all along
May all these walls be made in all our wasted years and days
Not stand in our way that we may feel the winds of change (change, turn it up)
(Change, turn it up)

(Change, turn it up)
And If these walls could sing they would sing us a hundred songs
If these walls could talk they would say
They would have seen it coming, coming, coming all along, all along

They would have seen it coming, coming, coming all along, all along
They would have seen it coming, coming, coming all along, all along
They would have seen it coming, coming, coming all along, all along
They would have seen it coming, coming, coming all along, all along",The Pizza Song

Standing in a missile town. Feels like it's coming alive
Riots and corruption, New Jersey roots!
These songs were the key to the engines of our growing up.

And we wanna say, thanks to the music in our lives,
forgive ourselves for all those lies.
Send some love to all the lonely,
Don't forget we're all one family.
Thanks to the music in our lives, for helping us to survive.
Lost in one lonely dream, born to run and LIVE FREE!

Walking in our own footsteps, a search for something more.

The Boxmasters,"I met a girl in Knoxville
A town we all know well,
And every Sunday evenin'
Out in her home I'd dwell.

We went to take an evening walk
About a mile from town,
I picked a stick up off the ground,
And knocked that fair girl down.

She fell down on her bended knees
For mercy she did cry.
""Oh Willy dear don't kill me here,
I'm not prepared to die.""

She never spoke another word
I only beat her more,
Until the ground around me
Within her blood did flow.

I took her by her golden curls
Dragged her 'round and 'round.
Then threw her in the river
That flows through Knoxville town.

Go there, go there,
You Knoxville girl
With dark and rolling eyes.

Go there, go there,
You Knoxville girl
You'll never be my wife.

I rolled and turned the whole night through
My dreams were living hell.
And then they came from Knoxville
And carried me to jail.

And time is passing slow.

I've been hearing all my life
Every night, at sundown
I hear its lonesome cry

When I look through the screen door
I see a rocking chair
My mama's sitting in it
Thinking 'bout that world out there

She wants to go over that mountain
To see what's on the other side
She said, ""I want to go over that mountain
Before the day that I die""

Well she's never set foot
Out of this poor valley holler
Though she talks about her dreams
Of some other way to fly

Eighty seven years of living
And never had much of anything
Is it asking too much to see
A damned old diesel train?

She wants to go over that mountain
To see what's on the other side
She said, ""I want to go over that mountain
Before the day that I die""

Twenty years ago, today
My daddy left this holler
He said, ""I'll be coming back
Tomorrow night""

I remember the sound
Of his boot heels in the gravel
Well, he ain't been back since
And he never said goodbye

To see what's on the other side
She said, ""I want to go over that mountain
Before the day that I die

The Boy Least Likely To,"Warm milk and honey
Sweeten my teeth.
From little acorns you..
You quietly made me..
Made me into me.

Paper thin skin stretched
Over my bones.
From shells and pebbles you..
You quietly made me..?
Made me a home.

But I can't get used
To being alone.
And I won't get used
To being alone.

Under a full moon,
Hopelessly trying to
Retrace our footsteps in the snow.
I don't know when to hang on
And when to let go.

Foxes in boxes,
And butterfly blues.
From little acorns you..
You quietly made me..
Made me into you.

Holding it under
My tongue 'til it stings.
From all of my demons
You quietly saved me
Again and again.

But now I feel
And surface again.
Yes, I can feel
And surface again.

From little bubbles,
Little air bubbles,
Little embolysms grow.
I don't know to hang on.
Everything I feel feels wrong.
I don't know when to hang on
And when to let go.

I packed my antihistamines and Tupperware drums
A harmonica and a box guitar
In a canvas covered wagon stuff with apples and with guns

We quietly slipped across the border into Arkansas
But still we couldn't find what it was we were looking for
So we trucked on down to try our luck along the Rio Grande
But I couldn't help but notice how
The little things that used to make us happy, made us sad

And no one ever signed our stupid country disco band

Lemons I make lemonade

I wake up every morning feeling sad
And I sleep with the light on
Sometimes you go to places in your dreams
That are hard to get back from

And I don't know what it is I'm afraid of
I just know that I'm afraid
But there's not a lot you can do with lemons
Except make them into lemonade
Lemonade, lemonade

I've been up, I've been down
I've always got my head in the clouds
Hoping that I could find
One of them that's silver-lined

I don't care, it can rain
All it wants on my parade

The Boy Least Likely To,"Sitting on a broken dream
And memories are what might have been
Biscuit crumbs and bird seed in his

Whiskers, whiskers, whiskers

Even though he never went to war
He still felt something worth fighting for
But no one else ever cared as much as

Whiskers, whiskers, whiskers
Whiskers, whiskers, whiskers

He sits in the moonlight
on top of the hill
Playing a penny whistle
and picking thistles out of his kilt

He rubs his paws together
and it begins to snow
As he counts up all the Christmas lights
in the village down below

He sits around the campfire
and licks at his wounds
Staring sadly back at his reflection
in a spoon

We used to want the same things
when we were growing up
But somewhere along the way
I started hoping for too much

I found his little plastic shield
Chewed up on the battlefield
And I knew then I'd never make a friend again like

The Boy Least Likely To,"In my heart, I can still feel
Every turn of the tractor wheel.
Budded furrows cut across the hillside,
Over the fields in the sunshine

And it hurt, but I still grew
With every clumsy punch I threw.
Up in anger, at the empty summer sky 
I saw the world from the underside.

And when the worm began to turn,
As it squirmed in the palm of my hand;
I began to understand 
Why it is,
The worm forgives the plough.

In my heart I can still feel,
Every turn of the tractor wheel.
As we cower in the shadow of the plow,
Chewing us up and spitting us out

As we fall our way back down
Into the earth and underground,
I discover that even a little worm
Has its ways of taking revenge on the world.

And when the worm began to turn,
As it squirmed in the palm of my hand;
I began to understand
Why it is,
The worm forgives the plough.

And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

We both found what we were looking for.
With a friend to call my own,
I'll never be alone, and you, my friend, will see,
You've got a friend in me.
Ben, you're always running here and there,
You feel you're not wanted anywhere.
If you ever look behind and don't like what you find
There's something you should know, you've got a place to go.
I used to say I and me, now it's us, now it's we.
I used to say I and me, now it's us, now it's we.

The Brady Bunch,"A long, long time ago...
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile.
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And, maybe, they'd be happy for a while.

But february made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver.
Bad news on the doorstep;
I couldn't take one more step.

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride,
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died.

So bye-bye, miss american pie.
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.
""this'll be the day that I die.""

Did you write the book of love,
And do you have faith in God above,
If the Bible tells you so? 
Do you believe in rock 'n roll,
Can music save your mortal soul,
And can you teach me how to dance real slow? 

Well, I know that you're in love with him
`cause I saw you dancin' in the gym.
You both kicked off your shoes.
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues.

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck,
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died.

I started singin',
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.
""this'll be the day that I die.""

Now for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone,
But that's not how it used to be.
When the jester sang for the king and queen,
In a coat he borrowed from james dean
And a voice that came from you and me,

Oh, and while the king was looking down,
The jester stole his thorny crown.
The courtroom was adjourned;
No verdict was returned.
And while lennon read a book of marx,
The quartet practiced in the park,
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died.

We were singing,
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.
""this'll be the day that I die.""

Helter skelter in a summer swelter.
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter,
Eight miles high and falling fast.
It landed foul on the grass.
The players tried for a forward pass,
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast.

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune.
We all got up to dance,
Oh, but we never got the chance!
`cause the players tried to take the field;
The marching band refused to yield.
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died? 

We started singing,
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.
""this'll be the day that I die.""

Oh, and there we were all in one place,
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again.
So come on: jack be nimble, jack be quick!
Jack flash sat on a candlestick
Cause fire is the devil's only friend.

Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage.
No angel born in hell
Could break that satan's spell.
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite,
I saw satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singing,
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.
""this'll be the day that I die.""

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news,
But she just smiled and turned away.
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before,
But the man there said the music wouldn't play.

And in the streets: the children screamed,
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed.
But not a word was spoken;
The church bells all were broken.
And the three men I admire most:
The father, son, and the holy ghost,
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died.

And they were singing,
""bye-bye, miss american pie.""
Drove my chevy to the levee,
But the levee was dry.
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""this'll be the day that I die.

They were four men, living all together,

And they knew it was much more than a hunch,
That this group would somehow form a family

Got a kid, nah, poppa's got a brand new bag

Stick it in easy, it comes back greasy

So many friends now and none of them mine
Forgotten as soon as we meet

To forever torment me and I wonder why
Do I wish I'd never known you at all

So many voices and nothing is there

Come on tell me what you can

Is only what our eyes can see
And our hands can feel

I can see your so afraid
We are like the silver herd on you even feel obscured
I wish, I wish I had some words to give
But all I can think to say
Is I will be with you everyday

I've seen it all time and again
Surprise jumps from behind every corner
So stop before you get roped in

And you will look quite pathetic when you become receptive
And then it smacks hard right on the chin

So wise up and come to your senses
There's only one way this can end
You can't be seeing things clearly
Or else you'd be covering your skin

It's the strong combination of fear and elation
That makes you not able to think
So get on the right side and forget about the bright side
There's only so much you can take

In the hopes that you'll wanna see

Don't get caught now with your head in the clouds

'Cause if you decide that you feel good inside

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

Was driving everybody out of their brains
But I convinced my best friends I lost my nerve 
And I pleaded I was being framed

I screamed out loud
""Sailor show me which way to go""

Due to my defiance 
The wedding ground to a halt
Said I changed my mind
Ain't no use in your trying
So her brother punched me in the throat
Her mother got hysterical
The bitch was cynical 
Father's in the corner drunk
Picking myself off the floor 
I ran to the door
Damned if I was skippin' on my way

Slander me, slag me
I'm not a man you should deride
I've heard everything
All your mudslinging
You better run, as fast as you can
Take you out, write you off, are you brave enough
To stand and fight like a man

The Brighouse & Rastrick Band,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

You feel you're not wanted anywhere.

I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall,
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

('How do you think he does it?)
I don't know!
(What makes him so good?')

Well, he ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind kid,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

He's a pinball wizard,
His score's a trillion more.
A pinball wizard,
The world's new pinball lord.
He's scoring more!
He's scoring more!
More more more more!

I thought I was the Bally table king,
But I just handed my pinball crown to him.

The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities

That brings the bare necessities of life

Wherever I wander, wherever I roam
I couldn't be fonder of my big home
The bees are buzzin' in the tree
To make some honey just for me
When you look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few

And you prick a raw paw

Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw

When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw

If you act like that bee acts, uh uh

The Broadways,"All down the streets the signs read cheaper and better technology
This capitalist vision is my nightmare, put up a sign in my face
What the fuck happened to this place?
I think we made a wrong turn now look at hte lovely concrete
I drove to my stupid job today, got stopped at an intersection
15 minutes of my life just rolled away
I looked at the guy next to me he didn't seem so happy
No ones happy but everyone's too busy to see
Let's go shopping today
Drive our fancy cars to the fancy malls and for lunch we'll have big macs
I wish I could turn the clock back to when I was ten
When I wasn't scared of everything
And everything wasn't so fucking crowded
And I wonder if my kids will ever see a horizon
Untouched by billboards and shopping malls
And I wonder if this crazy world thinks I'm the one who's crazy
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
I'm not crazy just frustrated

The Broadways,"the sky seemed far away
i tried to make sense of a thoughtless day
no disappointments stale words always know what to say
i took a train to olympia and realized once again how big the world was
i had forgotten how to breathe, we sat on the mountain
it seemed like i could touch the sky, no distractions
and i thought about the word freedom and what it really meant for me
because you see,
sometimes i don't feel so free when i'm stuck here in the city
i fell asleep on the side of the mountain
and i woke up to a peaceful morning
i took a deep breath as i stared across the canyon exhausted
hard concrete screaming my name
another year for me of worthless destiny
i've been waiting for the perfect time to scream
holding on and waiting for a better dream
i let so many slip through my fingers
as i watched the clock fade into the morning
so i smoke another cigarette as the sun rose over the city
but it didn't shine on me,
sleep has never made me happy what's left for me here
another lonely winter night, street lighs and a sleepless dream dismantled
words of indifference fall like rain
immersed into reality we all search for inspiration
sometimes it's really hard to find
but i found it on the mountain, now i'm back and i feel like i never left
sometimes i don't know where to go
a friend once told me to follow my dreams
but lately i've been asking myself
""what does it mean to be free?""
restless, someone tell me what to believe
i waste my days on an old fantasy
it's not the way it used to be

The Broadways,"You've been down for so long
The world can really do that to a kid
But you can't dwell on that shit
Gotta make the world the best you can
There's no reason for crying whoa oh keep on trying
Drink everyday to make the pain feel like it wasn't reall why there
Kill dreams in front of tvs
That is just what they love to hear
Maybe sometime... I will get off this fucking couch
I won't let this world drag me down
Kids like you and me will be FREE
Maybe sometime I won't have to wake up
And see another rainy day
A boring afternoon there's no prize at the end of this rainbow
No one to love
No one to talk to
So I'm gonna grab my umbrella and run outside
No rains gonna drown my ambition
Gonna make it this time

The Brobdingnagian Bards,"Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse.
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best...

And...always look on the bright side of life...
Always look on the light side of life...

If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing.
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle - that's the thing.

And...always look on the bright side of life...
Always look on the light side of life...

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow.
Forget about your sin - give the audience a grin
Enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow.

So always look on the bright side of death
Just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true.
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you.

And always look on the bright side of life...
Always look on the right side of life...
(Come on guys, cheer up!)
Always look on the bright side of life...
Always look on the bright side of life...
(Worse things happen at sea, you know.)
Always look on the bright side of life...
(I mean - what have you got to lose?)
(You know, you come from nothing - you're going back to nothing.
What have you lost? Nothing!)
Always look on the right side of life...",Always Look on the Bright Side of Life
The Brobdingnagian Bards,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
The Brobdingnagian Bards,"Some friends and I in a public house
Were playing a game of chance one night
When into the pub a fireman ran
His face all a chalky white.
What's up"", says Brown, ""Have you seen a ghost, 
Or have you seen your Aunt Mariah?
Me Aunt Mariah be buggered!, says he
The bleedin' pub's on fire!

And there was Brown upside down
Lappin'' up the whiskey on the floor.
Booze, booze!"" The firemen cried
As they came knockin' on the door (clap clap)
Oh don't let 'em in till it's all drunk up
And somebody shouted McIntyre, McIntyre 
And we all got blue-blind paralytic drunk
When the Old Dun Cow caught fire

Oh well, says Brown, what a bit of luck.
Everybody follow me.
And it's down to the cellar
If the fire's not there
Then we'll have a grand old spree
So we went on down after good old Brown
The booze we could not miss
And we hadn't been there ten minutes or so
Till we were quite pissed.

Then, Smith walked over to the port wine tub
And gave it just a few hard knocks (clap clap)
Started takin' off his pantaloons
Likewise his shoes and socks.
Hold on, says Brown, that ain't allowed
Ya cannot do that thing here.
Don't go washin' trousers in the port wine tub
When we got Guinness beer

Then there came from the old back door
The Vicar of the local church.
And when he saw our drunken ways, 
He began to scream and curse.

Ah, you drunken sods! You heathen clods! 
You've taken to a drunken spree! 
You drank up all the Benedictine wine
And you didn't save a drop for me!

And then there came a mighty crash
Half the bloody roof caved in.
We were almost drowned in the fireman's hose
But still we were gonna stay.
So we got some tacks and some old wet sacks
And we nailed ourselves inside
And we sat drinking the finest Rum
Till we were bleary-eyed.

Later that night, when the fire was out
We came up from the cellar below.
Our pub was burned. Our booze was drunk.
Our heads was hanging low.
""Oh look"", says Brown with a look quite queer.
Seems something raised his ire.
Now we gotta get down to Murphy's Pub, 
It closes on the hour

Background: Our friend Snicker first suggested this
Song in 2000 at the Texas Renaissance ""Venice"" Faire
(It rained a lot that year). At long last, we've added
It to our repetoire and what a great addition it is.
It's a great sing-a-long and fun to shout along with, 
And after our first performance of it, I'm happy to say
It's gonna be hit! This version came from a live
Recording we found an MP3 of. Hopefully, we'll have a
Recording some time early next year.",Old Dun Cow

The Brodsky Quartet,"We live on a mountain right at the top
There's a beautiful view from the top of the mountain
Every morning, I walk towards the edge
And throw little things off
Like car-parts, bottles and cutlery
Or whatever I find lying around
It's become a habit a way to start the day

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

It's early mornin' no-one is awake
I'm back at my cliff still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make on their way down
I follow with my eyes 'til they crash
Imagine what my body would sound like
Slammin' against those rocks
And when it lands will my eyes be closed or open?

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

Safe up here with you
Safe up here with you
Safe up here with you

I never wanted to admit to this but my love wasn't true
I rescue the lonely because I'm lonely too
And the way you smile the way you laugh
Reminds me of myself
Before I fell apart like a drug infected heart
All along in a city by the sea
Dirty leaves fall around
All alone and suddenly it seems
Dirty leaves fall for you and me
I never wanted your heart to break
But we still knew it would
Impossible to save
But did when I could
I replaced your tears your loneliness with cigarettes and wine
But you needed more and we ran out of time
Now your love is gone
All all alone in the city by the sea
Dirty leaves fall all around
And suddenly it seems
Dirty leaves fall for you and me
And once again I'm torn between saving you or saving me
That's why I begged you not to stay
Any longer than you should
Because I always knew you would
And now it builds more every day
Until you're just an object in my way
Choking on the words I never wanted you to say
All all alone in the city by the sea

Beg rip of your face
So be careful how much you take

Waiting on your dance floor
Because you'll never make the right decisions

Mislead you know you won't admit it
You went against your own

Has one good chance to die
To be swallowed whole by the big blue empty sky
Feel the heavens stare
With a cold hard look in it's eyes

This could be so much worse
But we sold our souls for gold
You know that nobody in this room
Wants to hear you cry
And if nobody goes for help
Baby you're gonna die

A chance to shake your head and say
How did it come to this

Lord, You know the many times I’ve gone astray
But I’ve learned that Your love is stronger than my weakness
And you ear is open every time I pray
No one else has ever cared for me like You, Lord
Other friends could never be as close to me
I’m not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow
Knowing You are everything I’ll ever need

I’m amazed that You love me
I’m amazed how You care
Through Your precious blood
I’ve fond pardon
And my sins are washed,
They’re all washed away

Orange birds and river cousins
Dressed in green

Pretty music, I hear
So happy and loud
Blue flowers echo
From a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh
If you try to ask
""Is it cool?""

See speakers of kite
With velvet roses diggin'

I have never been so much
In love
Before

What a difference
A true love made in my life
So nice
So right

Loving you gave me something new
That I've never felt
Never dreamed of
Somethings changed
No, it's not the
Feeling I had before

Ooh, it's much much more
Love I never knew that it's touch
Could mean so much

What a difference
And when we walked hand in hand
I feel
So real

Lovers come and then lovers go
That's what folks say
Don't they know
They're not there
When you love me
Hold me and say you care

And what we have is much more
Than they could see

What we have is much more
Than they could see

What we have is much more
Than they could see

What we have is much more
Than they could see

Well, the first time I saw you
Was the first time I lost you
And the first time I kissed you
Was the first time I missed you

There were times when we tried to
Get by with some love too
But the things that we went through
Were so cold, don't let me remind you

It takes one to be alone
And it takes two to carry on
Tell me what you want to say
When you'll take my love
And just walk away

Is it love that we're missing
Peace of mind we're not getting
Are the games that we're playing
Simply our way of entertaining

Since the start you don't seem to
Realize what I've been through
Since the start I have tried to
Make you see that I need you

It takes one to be alone
And it takes two to carry on
Tell me what you want to say
When you'll take my love
And just walk away

And at times when we drift to
Our knees but forgot to
Leave behind all the past fun
Sometimes I find it hard to comfort
Wonder why we're not one

If I have wounded any soul today
If I have caused one foot to go astray
If I have walk in my own willful way
Dear Lord, forgive

If I have uttered idle words of flame
If I have turned aside from want or pain
Lest I offend some other through the strain
Dear Lord, forgive

Forgive the sins I have confessed to Thee
Forgive the secret sins I do not see
Oh guide me love me and my keeper be
Dear Lord, forgive...

No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin
What did I do to be so black and blue?
Tell me, what did I do?

So honey never hang your signal out for me

Bought a one way ticket and I won't be back

Hear that lonesome whistle blow that's your cue and by now you know
That I got another true lover waitin' in Tennessee
This midnight special is a burnin' the rail so woman don't try to follow my trail

Hear her thunder on through the night this Golden Rocket is a doin' me right
And that sunny old southland sure is a part of me
Now from your call board erase my name your fire went out you done lost your flame

And this Golden Rocket is rollin' my blues away
That old conductor he seemed to know you done me wrong I was feelin' low
For he yelled aloud we're over that Dixon Line
The brakeman started singin' a song said you're worried now but it won't be long

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

I just can't fall asleep without you

I will sing and shout 
If that's what you've asked for
And I will live life proud
Shining your light on it.
I will sing and shout 
If that's what you've asked for
And I will live life proud, 
Shining your light on it.

Crash,
It's like a paperweight 
Fell from the clouds onto my head 
Without a touch of pain. 
And like a winner's crutch, 
It's just too much to take. 
I keep my vices in the closet
Waiting for a chance to take
All that is left of me
All that is left for me

And, I need to remember at times
That this head of mine, 
Well, it's not always screwed on right.
I'm not always right.
And I know what you promised, 
I'm completely aware
But I'm asking, Lord, 
I need to know, I just need to know

What we're here for?
What we're made for?
What we breathe for?
What we bleed for?

What are we here for?
I'm begging.

I just want to keep you next to me
Hold me close, let these words unfold into a beautiful tranquil melody

Give me your heartache, give me your love baby
Give me your heart and wrap it tightly
Give me your heartache and all of your trust
Give me your reasons to hold on to me

It's been rough, you could never give me enough
You could never give enough to me
I've been wrong, but it's too far gone

I've been so lonely without your body.",Your Reasons
The Bunny The Bear,"Dream, lay next to me.
I felt your body quiver in silence, wrapped in disease.
Well, no one has found such luck, a lion's bite.
The ugly duck lies in the corner, a headache for lovers, a whore to end up on her knees.

Mother, we're sick of this.
Your flowers, your scripture, your ignorant bliss.
Mother, we're sick of these games.
Our father? Is that who's to blame?

Lay next to me, give me a reason to believe we don't belong here.
I'll catch your dreams.
We can do better than this.

Dream, lie once for me. (1,2,3)
I felt your tongue chase demons and bad taste right out of me.
Well, still caught in such bad luck, a nervous voice,
The ugly duck lies in the corner, spreads legs for lovers and watches them choke on disease.

Lover, I'm sick of this.
Your smile, your swallow, your innocent kiss,
Lover, I'm sick of these games,
Your father? Is that who's to blame?
Still, nothing has changed
Do we eat where we shit now?
It's sick and deranged.
Now our smiles bring cancer.",Cancer
The Bunny The Bear,"Well, You keep breathing with uncertainty.
But still, I stay here.
And I won't budge until your heart explodes from all of your fears.
Your eyes are glossed, I can't be trusted.
I'm a menace, just a vice.
And I can't sleep without a drink or walk away when there's a fight.

I swear we'll pull through.
Trust me like you did when I first touched, first met you.

I still can't forget how my heart stopped when our bodies first touched.
Now I can't lay with you.",First Met You

She'll never get out.",Flying Like a Bird
The Bunny The Bear,"Well, Hey...
You're bringing back heartache, now a first name basis.
You shift the blame on me, but I have this crutch and it treats me well
and it makes me blush.
You say that we went astray from the moment that we let our hands have their way...
Or brains? Are they one in the same? In the moments we fake and the motions we slave.

I'm working on my pity and I'm sacrificing truth.
I'm acknowledging the moments that I've wasted on you.
I'm igniting all the ladies hearts with movements set on me.
I'm delivering the holocaust with sheep and bloody knees.
I'm complaining while indifferent and still honestly confused.
I am humble, I am heartache, I am young and abused.
I am numb, but I feel everything, I'm giving it to you...
As a gift, as a plea, as a right to abuse.

I lost myself, I found my way.
I've touched your thighs, I've felt your pain.
I've cried out loud, I've told the truth.
I've sacrificed my hold on you.
You're innocent, you spread your legs, you played your part, you had your way.
You've dug your hole, you've paved the way.
Well, you're hip and a flop and on top of the food chain.",Food Chain
The Bunny The Bear,"You made it seem like everything had been forgotten.
Like everything that Ive forgotten...gave hope to me.
You made it through without all the stains or the fire.
A burden to carry us higher, and I gave it to you.

I've brought an end, gave up all the flings and desires,
A burden that made me feel higher. Because you made it seem...
You always knew the truth in my eyes, unexpected...
The lies that I thought I'd protected, but you seemed to see.

I never thought I'd see the day someone breathed for me.
The day it'd grow old just to burden myself and to bandage the holes.
I never thought I'd see the day someone breathed just like me.
The day in my heart when the truth would unfold and it'd tear me apart.

The ship hit the seas with hopes of new land and desire, a vision to carry here higher.
Well, you made it seem...
And the sirens led us to the wreck. And the anchor will pull in the deck.
Water sweeps so smooth when every last scream, it reflects back on you.

Well, I give it to you. 
Carry me through. 
Bury me. 
Caught up in the wreckage, baby.",High Tides and Swimming Conditions

Our dear children, they're turning blue, smoke in their lungs.
Please, breath. They're just children.
Finding out that we all die.

Smile, pale green eyes. We're breeding suicide.
Let me take what you dispise and paint it grey.
When we count the  mistakes, all the moments awake...
When you count all these stars, when it's gone too far.
I think it's time I burn this city.

The Bunny The Bear,"We stand alone on the edge, we build our homes.

We stand alone.
Nothing can change what we built on blame.
Let us never question what we owe.
We breathe once, we breath twice, we let go.
Our diet's fallacy, we eat the seeds we sow.

Trust me, pale green eyes, we were born to lie.
Your mother can't save you, she birthed you in blame,
The sins of your father, your chore for the day.
And it's cold where you sleep when the distance can drag you away.

Well, I still love the way she feels. Yea, I still love the way...

The Bunny The Bear,"Let me see the eyes of redemption.
Swallow it now.
Here comes the fire.

My Darling, forgive me for giving up too early.
The times have kept us apart. Just bury your heart.
I guess now, we'll find out just how far we can take this.

Breathe just to start. Swallow it now.

The common dilemma, the black hole of existence.
The state of mind that left me in this room for hours,
Wondering where the time went, spent biting your hips.
Spent emotionless in dust.
Around the breeze I bend and tarnish.
I knew. I knew. I wish I knew.

So smooth, the thrill. Follow your heart.

I guess now, we found out just how far we could take this.","So Smooth, So Appealing"
The Bunny The Bear,"Sleep. You’ve been seen with another. It’s sick, and it’s killing me.
Grab a stone make her… 
Breathe, let my lungs act as water, as clean as we’ll ever be.

And we draw with light, the little things that used to matter.
Are words what they seem? And are these little things all you really left me?
Yea, you said, “Goodnight”.
You told me everybody had to live off honest intentions. Or we’d lose this fight?
But all these broken things are all you ever left me.

The birds bring flu. We justify our self indulgence cause there’s nothing to do.
I wish my words rang true. But then again, I never meant to.
Taste the summer, yea you smell so sweet.
I take a bite and I’m surprised to find the taste of meat.
I swallow water looking for some relief.
Where’s my God? Where’s my secret when there’s nothing to keep?

Don’t you see it?
The worms have spread this havoc.
Yes, my heart is warm like the book your mother used to read… 
As you slept so soundly, as you learned heartache…
We all lie. We all die.",Curtain Call
The Bunny The Bear,"I’m left alone again, without a plan, just remorse.
How does your best friend tire and push towards divorce?
I think it’s sad to say how I found out this place was never both our homes.
And I found all my dreams in this house, scattered abusively.
Communication doesn’t matter when we never speak.
So now I’m forced to pray and scatter like the Autumn leaves.
Dead Leaves...

Burn our photos, torch our lives. One-sided compromise? Or is it suicide?
I think it’s safe to say that I’ve lost the only hope I’ve known.

And I can’t breathe again, on this couch, on this bed.
But you’re not here, I swear to God that it’s all come to an end.
You said, “I love you. Oh, I love you.”
Well you loved me so you walked away?
Now you’ve asked me to move, cut my ties at the roots.
You told me if I really loved you I’d put down the booze.
But as I started to walk your way…
You said, “Why don’t we wait it out another day?”",Dead Leaves
The Bunny The Bear,"Maybe we’re out of time…all our signs, wasted.
Maybe we’ve reached goodbye? Still, we tried, we tried.
Maybe we’re meant to die with our hands empty...

I’m not giving up...

And were times really so hard you would walk out?
You’d break me, you’d crush me, you promised you loved me.
And was I really that mistake that made you hate yourself and give up on me?
I’m sorry…I’m sorry… Please don’t give up me.

Or just let go of me.
We’re wasting our time, our lives. 

Or maybe I could tell you that I never meant to hurt you, 
Forget me, forgive me, please...
Maybe I could tell you this was never meant to hurt,
But now you’re asking too much from me.",Empty Hands
The Bunny The Bear,"I've been waiting for this night.
When everything's alright, there's still so much to change, and nothing means everything.
It's drawn out way too long, its tarnished every song...
There's still so much to say.  ""I'd give up everything...""

So give me something to sleep... Call it ""Restlessly"".
I'll take it now while my stomach lays empty.
So teach me something to pray, a few words I can say to make these demons or my conscience go away.
I'll teach my son how to lie, better yet, how to fly.
I'll teach him patience, where we go the day we die.
I'll tell him all of the ways his father's heart was led to stray...
Why not pollute him with the things I have to say?!

Close your eyes...
My love, this love...
It's something we'll never see.

There's a pause, we lay silent. We both count all the stars in the sky.
We both wish for such silly things...Then continues the silence.",Loose Lips
The Bunny The Bear,"Our song has swallowed the Sun. It’s killing me softly, our worlds drift apart.
And you’re damn wrong, I couldn’t live without you.
Cut all these wires that control the beat of my heart.
Cut all these wires that control the beat of my dead heart.

Take all I have…
Please just take all the time that you need.
Break me in pieces and toss the remains in the sea.
You know that I've tried.

Run with my heart, choke on the lies.
Tear me apart and call it “Love, Trust and Compromise.”

You know I’d follow you down to the pits of hell…","Love, Trust and Compromise"
The Bunny The Bear,"Why would you marry me? Or was it for our families? 
We share a bed at their feet.
And our nights, well we dwell on these fights, 
And we punish our son for the times that we've lied.
And you’ve deafened the choir, you bed-ridden horse.
And you’ve spit on my motions as if they were yours.
I’m aware you’re in need and you’re counting on me.
Why waste living on the likes of me? Save conscience for the slaughtered sheep.

Well, I’ve been meaning to give you a reason.
The stones in hand will block out the sun, they’ll cleanse our sins just for fun.
While you’ve been sleeping, I’m wide-awake dreaming.
When my lover’s touch has faded and I wake up…
She’s not next to me.

I’m alive, I’m unwell.
Maybe heading to hell.
I’m alive, but unwell, and I sure deserve hell.
I’m alive and a lie, such a lie, it’s a lie…
It’s a lie.

In the backseat, you can find me with my lover.
Just a crutch for the night.
Her heart flutters at the drop of a dime.
And when the night is young I’ve had my fun, 
I’ll hold her far and tight.",Lover's Touch
The Bunny The Bear,"Well, did you think that I would feel this way?
I just don't think that your lips will ever taste the same.
And are you relevant, without a care?
How do you sleep at night when tossing is endured by fear?
Well, the plunge and the pain…
Just like a sink, it's meant for drowning on another day.
Well, your legs, painted grey…
It's like story blowing over on a rainy day.
When our lips meet we'll ignite this whole God fearing city.
When your lust dries up I still won't go away.
When our bodies meet we're acting via civil motion…
But I doubt our frequency will ever be the same.
And with the motions she fakes, she counts the hearts that she breaks
and screams, 
""Trust me! Touch me! Trust me!” Lust...
Please take my life, gouge my eyes.
Make your way into me.
Take my pride, Hands on thighs.
Suck me dry.
So put it simply, she's still lonely.
And I'll try to refrain from the lies that I make.
So put it simply, she’s still lonely.
And I'll try to refrain…
Come on...",Motions
The Bunny The Bear,"Dodging these stones yet again, still dreaming of something.
And it’s safe to say I’ve come to call home a couch, our floorboard or just nothing.
Well, I swear to God I love you. I swear to God I need you too.
I swear to God I’m telling you the truth….

Lost in Oblivion. 
Praying for something, waiting for nothing.
I am the morning sun.
Rising for nothing, shining for no one.

I will never burn out.

I’m sure some will say that I’ve truly lost my way.
""Love your vice, love your crutch but you’re drowning from the rain.
And you’re swimming with the eels, yea you’ve raised your price to play.

The Bunny The Bear,"I’m left here, emotionless. I taste the colors of your skin.
It may be safe to say that I’ve gone astray,
And I would do it again if you let me have my way.
If I could slip you out of your lingerie, if I could slip you our of your coat…
I’d find a way to make excuses for the way I behaved,
And I’d lie through my teeth until the dust had settled evenly.

Sick, sad eyes…
Why don’t we talk about it?!
Compromise.

Close your eyes.
I’ll take you home, when one last kiss will not suffice.
Close your eyes.
I’ll take you home, when one last kiss, it brings the death of me.

Close your eyes. 
I’ll take you home but just a kiss will not suffice.
I want you broken on the floor for just one night.
So spread your legs, I’ll let my instincts get the best of me.

Smashing chairs through the window

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Today I could see
The way she her head when she walked by

I think I'm gonna love her

I'd let her go and still be just the same

I thought that I would want to let her go

Realize how much I didn't know

Green and blossomin' round against the sea
And there the sun came and the rain pourin' down
Garden grew and flourished and splattered bits of color on the ground
And it took shape and symmetry and all of life around
But there came winds driven and howling
There came snow and I feared for the garden
So I built a wall and I built another and roofed it over thick and strong
And kept it from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
The killing cold could not get in
But when the sun came and the gentle rain of spring
They could not reach the garden behind those walls
It would have died, safely, securely, died

I went upon the spree

Fast got drunk as drunk could be

And when my money was all gone
It was then that I wanted more
But a man must be blind to make up his mind
To go to sea once more

Too drunk to roll in bed
Me watch, it was new and my money was too

The whores they all would roar
There goes Jarr Tarr the poor sailor
He must go to sea once more

I ran into Rapper Brown
I asked him for to take me in
And he looked at me with a frown

He said, ""Last time you was on board with me
You job no score, but I'll take your advance
And I'll give you the chance
And I'll send you to sea once more""

They shipped me aboard of a whaling ship
Bound for the Arctic Sea
Where the cold winds blow through the frost and the snow
Jamaica rum would freeze

Alas! I had no luck with my gear
For I left my money ashore
It was then that I wished
That I was there, safe with the girls ashore

Come all ye boat seafaring lads
Who listen to my song
And when you come off them long trip
Pray that you don't go wrong

But get married lads and have all night in
And go to to sea no more",Jack Tarr the Sailor

And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads

And be still floatin'
And never hit bottom and keep falling through
Just relaxed and paying attention?

All my two-dimensional boundaries were gone
I had lost to them badly
I saw that world crumble and thought I was dead
But I found my senses still working

And as I continued to drop through the hole
I found all surrounding
To show me that joy innocently is
Just be quiet and feel it around you

And I opened my heart to the whole universe
And I found it was loving
And I saw the great blunder my teachers had made
Scientific delirium madness

Oh, I will keep falling as long as I live
Ah, without ending
And I will remember the place that is now
That has ended before the beginning

Oh, how is it that I could come out to you
And be still floatin'
And never hit bottom and keep falling through

Hiding from the children, so they would not tell

Help me find a way to fill these empty hours

Say you will come again tomorrow

She would stare across the water from the trees
Last time, he was home he held her on his knees
And said the next time, they would sail away just where they pleased

If all I was was passing time, my life was just a season

Dirty hands and root beer stands and money like a river
Making deals to see how it feels to get more than you're giving

Where the diamond crescent's glowing
And run across the valley
Beneath the sacred mountain
And wander through the forest
Where the trees have leaves of prisms
And break the light in colors

And when it's time I'll go and lay
Beside the legendary fountain
'Till I see her form reflected
In its clear and jewelled waters
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our visions
Flow into one another

And two ladies escorting me to the halls
