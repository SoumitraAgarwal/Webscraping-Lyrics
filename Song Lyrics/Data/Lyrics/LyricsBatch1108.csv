Ray Charles,"What have I got to do to make you love me
What have I got to do to make you care,
What do I do when lightning strikes me
And I wake to find that you're not there?

What have I got to do to make you want me,
What have I got to do to be heard,
What do I say when it's all over?
And sorry seems to be the hardest word.

It's sad (so sad)
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd.
It's sad (so sad)
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh it seems to me 
That sorry seems to be the hardest word.

What have I got to do to make you love me
What have I got to do to be heard,
What do I do when lightning strikes me
What have I got to do?
What have I got to do
When sorry seems to be the hardest word?",Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word
Ray Charles,"Oh Lord I feel fine today, 
I'm walking on cloud nine today.
I'm over that line today, 
Happiness is finally mine today.
I guess I'm just a lucky guy 
And I'm prepared to tell you why.
It's strictly on account 
Of my sweet potato pie.

I'm the fellow that she loves the most, 
The main reason why she left the coast.
She's my little girlzina, 
That much hotter that a jalapeno.
Tender like a night in June, 
Sweeter than a honeymoon,
Brighter than a silver spoon, 
Just as crazy as a loon.

Softer than a lullaby, 
Deeper than the midnight sky, 
Soulful as a baby's cry, 
My sweet potato pie.

I used to see her around the neighborhood, 
I wonder how she grew up so good.
She belonged to Freddy and he was bad 
And I never was ready to make him mad.
I'm glad I had to wait awhile, 
A little bit too juvenile.
I needed to refine my style, a silk suit 
And a crocodile smile.

So let the whole damn world go by 
'Cause I just want to testify
From now on it's me 
And my sweet potato pie.",Sweet Potato Pie
Ray Charles,"I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
And the heavens open every time she smiles
And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet I'm running to her like a river's song

[Chorus:]
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

[Chorus]

Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day
Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole
Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul",Crazy Love [Live] [Live]

Ray Charles,"Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness, hello loneliness

Bye bye love, bye bye sweet caress, hello emptiness

She was my baby till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been

It was just one of those things

I'm with you rain or shine",Come Rain or Come Shine [Live]

Ray Charles,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song [*][Multimedia Track]

And live rejoicing every, everyday

About this blackjack game

Ray Charles,"Where has my love gone?
How can I go on?
It seems dear love has gone away.

Where is my spirit?
I'm nowhere near it,
Oh yes, my love has gone astray.

But Ill blame it on the sun,
The sun that didn't shine,
Ill blame it on the wind and the trees.

Ill blame it on the time that never was enough,
Ill blame it on the tide and the sea,
But, my heart blames it on me.

Who poured the love out?
What made this bitter doubt?
Is peace not here for me to see?

Wish I could tell you,
But, words won't come for me to speak.

But Ill blame it on the sun,
That didn't fill the sky,
Ill blame it on the birds and the trees.

Ill blame it on the day that ended once too soon,
Ill blame it on the nights that could not be,
But, my heart blames it on me.

Your heart blames it on you this time.

Ray Charles,"Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been

No one comes near.

Ray Charles,"As I passed by
A real fine hotel
A chick walked out
She sure looked swell
I gave her the eye
And started to carry on
When a Cadillac cruised up
And 'swish' she was gone

It should've been me
With that real fine chick
It should've been me
With that real fine chick
Hey hey hey, hey, driving that, Cadillac

A little later on
A theater I passed
I spotted another chick
And did she have class
I was all set
To write her name in my book
When her husband came up and gave me a
Real dirty look

It should've been me
With that real fine chick
It should've been me
With that real fine chick
It should've been me
To have been her chaperone

When I got to the corner
I saw a sharp cat
With a 300 dollar suit on
And a 100 dollar hat
He was standing on the sidewalk
By a DynaFlow
When a voice within said,
""C'mon daddy, let's go.""

It should've been me
With that real fine chick
It should've been me
With that real fine chick
It should've been me
Hey hey hey, hey, driving that, DynaFlow

I ate a bowl of chili
And I felt OK
At least until I passed
This fine Cafe
I saw a guy eatin'
A great big steak
While a waitress stood by feedin' him
Ice cream and cake

It should've been me
With that real fine chick
It should've been me
With that real fine chick
You know, it should've been me
Eatin' ice, cream and cake

Ray Charles,"After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get, off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank god, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Couldn't eat, was dispeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there

Romance, finis. your chance, finis.
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more",Bewitched
Ray Charles,"You're more than life to me,
More than eternity...
And the more I know of you,
All the more I love you...

I need you more each day,
Much more than words can say...
More than forevermore,
I'll be yours...

The silver moon will fade too soon,
And bring the dawn when you'll be gone...
Before you go, please let me know,
That what you feel is really real...

So do not grieve that I must leave,
Because I live only for,
Your love an' mine,
More and more!

Ray Charles,"Usin' the phone booth,
Makin' a few calls,
Doodlin' weird things,
Usin' the booth walls.

Got me a big date,
Waitin' for my chick,
Puttin' my face on,
So she could look slick,

I enjoy procrastinating
'Cause I'm busy while I'm waiting,
Doodlin' away, doodlin away

Sittin' and dinin' (dining)
Dinner beginnin',
Started designin'
Usin' the linen,

Talkin' to my date,
Doodlin' my bit,
Waiter got salty,
Told me to please quit
Told the waiter, ""Don't be dizzy,
""Can't you see I'm very busy,
""Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.""

""Do you doodle all day?""
Asked the waiter in his way,
""Do you doodle all night?""
Told the waiter he was right,
""In your doodlin' way-""
""That's the way I'm gonna stay,""
""Are you thinkin' things right?""
""Doodlin' sheds a lot of light,""
""Don't know what I can do,""
""Ain't nothing you can do,""
""With old doodlin' you,""
""Doodin's all I want to do,""

That's for true!

Why does every single thing I see
Look exactly like a doodle to me?
If I ever have a doubt
What life is all about
I get my pencil out and then commence to doodlin' 
And I find it real relaxing
'Specially when I feel that life is really taxing!

'Cause weird designs
They only show what's going on 
In weirder minds
Those when you doodle then your noodle's flying blind
Every little thing that you write
Just conceivably might
Be a thought that you capture
While coppin' a wink
Doodlin' takes you beyond what you see
When you write what you think.

I'd feel so lost without my doodlin',
Doodlin' really helps me ease my mind,
I'd be tempest-tossed
Without my doodlin',
When I'm doodlin' there's one thing I find,

Truly, I really really really really really truly truly wanna figure out
What my doodlin's all about.

Later the waiter
Had me arrested,
Took me to Bellevue,
Where I was tested.

Had me a doctor
Probin' my noodle,
'Fore he was half-done,
Taught him to doodle,
Showed him hidden thoughts that linger 
Find an outlet through your finger,
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away.

Doctor was real nice,
Told me to be cool,
Looked at the waiter, 
Called him the real fool, 

Looked at my baby
Told me he dug her,
Got me to doodlin',
So he could bug her,

When he put his arms around her,
Quite to his surprise he found her, 
Doodlin' away, doodlin' away

We just doodle all day!",Doodlin' (Instrumental)
Ray Charles,"You have loved lots of girls in the sweet long-ago
And each has meant heaven to you
You have vowed your affection to each one in turn
And have sworn to them all you'd be true
You have kissed 'neath the moon while the world seemed in tune,
Then you've left her to hunt a new game.
Does it ever occur to you later my boy, that she's prob'ly doing the same?
If you want to feel wretched and lonely and blue,
Just imagine the girl you love best
In the arms of some fellow who's stealing a kiss
From the lips that you once fondly pressed
But the world moves apace and the loves of today
Flit away with a smile and a tear,
So you can never tell who's kissing her now
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year.
I wonder who's kissing her now, I wonder who's teaching her how,
I wonder who's looking into her eyes, breathing sighs, telling lies.
I wonder who's buying the wine for lips that I used to call mine.
I wonder if she ever tells him of me, I wonder who's kissing her now.",I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now

Going to change the number where I live at.

I think about the lousy way you treat me
Your always-raising sin
I know that you know that I know
That you've got another man
Ah, Half the time that I'm at home
I have to go to a café and eat
And when you argue all night long 
I have to go down to the den and sleep

Your loving eases all my pain

And when you put your loving arms around me honey
You make old Ray forget about everything

I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty whenever you're near

Don't you know that you're leading me on? 
And it's just what I want you to do
Can't you see that I'm hopelessly lost?
That's why I'm following you

On my own
When I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams

A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile
Ray Condo,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Ray Conniff,"One is a spirit of Christmas
It is the celebration of the birth of the Christ child!
This we will never forget!
Oh, this we will never forget!
But there are other little things too!
Yes, there are other little things too!

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire,
Jack Frost nipping at your nose,
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright.
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times, many ways:
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas to you! Merry Christmas to you!
To you!
Merry Christmas everybody and a Happy New Year!
To you!",The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You)
Ray Conniff,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine
Ray Conniff,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
Ray Conniff,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Ray Conniff,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Ray Conniff,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine

Same old tingle that I feel inside

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for

Ray Conniff,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say I love you
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs

Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny

A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still

Ray Conniff,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura
Ray Conniff,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring

The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing

How lovely it was.

Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,

Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,

Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,

Ray Conniff,"Little Lilly was oh! So silly and shy
And all the fellows knew,

o cuddle up to her, but she would cry:
 
""Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
I'm beside him, Mercy!
Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ev'ry minute he gets bolder,
Now he's leaning on my shoulder,
Ma, he's kissing me!""
 
Lilly was so good, ev'ry body could tell.
You'd never see her roam,
She'd always stay at home;
All the neighbors knew little Lilly too well.
For when the boys would call, They'd hear her yell:
 
Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
If you peek in, Can't you see I'm goin' to weaken?

Remember the night, the night you said, 
""I love you"" -- re - mem - ber?
Remember you vowed by all the stars 
Above you -- re - mem - ber?
Remember we found a lonely spot,
And after I learned to care a lot,
You promised that you'd forget me not,
But you forgot  to  re - mem - ber.
Into my dreams you wandered, it seems, and then there came a day

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Ray Conniff,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care

Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?

Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind

Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me

Everybody finds somebody, someplace
There's no telling where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps saying
My someplace is here

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charm
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find what I've found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody, sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you, like you

Now everybody loves somebody, sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you
Everybody's [Incomprehensible] somebody like you

The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots

Remain to love until they droop and die

Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping'
This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing;
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

Why lies He in such mean estate,
Where ox and ass are feeding'
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.

Nails, spear shall pierce Him through,
The cross be borne for me, for you.
Hail, hail the Word made flesh,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,
Come peasant, king to own Him;
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
Raise, raise a song on high,
The virgin sings her lullaby.
Joy, joy for Christ is born,

We were like children posing
Playing at games, acting out names
Guessing the parts we played

Oh, what a hit we made
We came on next to closing

I turned and you were gone
While from the darkened wings
The music box played on

I hear it still, I always will

See the loneliness there inside you

Why do all the boys just pass you by
Could it be you just don't try
Or is it the clothes you wear

You're always window shopping
But never stopping to buy
So shed those dowdy feathers
And fly a little bit

Hey there, Georgy girl
There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide
And oh, what a change there'd be
The world would see
A new Georgy girl

Inside you

Hey there, Georgy girl
Dreaming of the someone you could be
Life is a reality
You can't always run away

Don't be so scared of changing
And rearranging yourself
It's time for jumping down
From the shelf a little bit

Hey there, Georgy girl
There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide
And oh, what a change there'd be

What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night

Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?

'Cause she walks downtown with a suitcase in her hand
Lookin' for a mysterious dark-haired man

Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
And promised her he'd take her for his bride

I think about her face aglow and ease my mind 
 
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy 
And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me

Ray Conniff,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",Sound of Silence

Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Ray Conniff,"When I was young

I'd listened to the radio

Waitin' for my favorite songs

Waiting they played I'd sing along

It made me smile


Those were such happy times

And not so long ago

How I wondered where they'd gone

But they're back again

Just like a long lost friend

All the songs I loved so well


(*) every sha-la-la-la

Every wo-wo-wo

Still shines

Every shing-a-ling-a-ling

That they're starting to sing's

So fine


When they get to the part

Where he's breakin' her heart

It can really make me cry

Just like before

It's yesterday once more


Lookin' back on how it was

In years gone by

And the good times that I had

Makes today seem rather sad

So much has changed


It was songs of love that

I would sing to then

And I'd memorize each word

Those old melodies

Still sound so good to me

As they melt the years away


Repeat (*)


All my best memories

Come back clearly to me

Some can even make me cry

Just like before

Whom angels greet with anthems sweet, While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King, Whom shepherds guard and angels sing;
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud, The Babe, the Son of Mary.

Why lies He in such mean estate, Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here The silent Word is pleading.
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through, The cross be borne for me, for you.
Hail, hail the Word made flesh, The Babe, the Son of Mary.

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh, Come peasant, king to own Him;

Ray Conniff,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say - come dance with me
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems at seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said - pity please the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

So remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality and dubious integrity
Their small-town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen

To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game, and when we dare
We cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say - come on, dance with me
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me, at seventeen",At Seventeen

I'm lying in bed,
Holdin' you close in my dreams;
Thinkin' about all the things that we said
And comin' apart at the seams.
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough;
I know you were tryin'
To give me the best of your love.

Beautiful faces,
Loud empty places
Look at the way that we live,
Wastin' our time
On cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give.

The same old crowd
Was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above,
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love.

I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today.

I want to hold you just one more time

And say goodbye

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me till I'm through
This is something I hate to do

Ray Conniff,"My child arrived just the other day
Came into the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin’ ‘fore I knew it, and as he grew
He’d say “I’m gonna be like you, Dad
You know I’m gonna be like you.”

“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, “Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let’s play
Can you teach me to throw?” I said, “Not today
I got a lot to do”, he said, “That’s ok.”
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, “I’m gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I’m gonna be like him.”

And the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
“Son, I’m proud of you. Can you sit for a while?”
He shook his head and said with a smile,
“What I’d really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?”

“When you comin’ home, son?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, Dad

Well, I’ve long since retired; my son’s moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, “I’d like to see you if you don’t mind.”
He said, “I’d love to, Dad, if I can find the time.
You see, my new job’s a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it’s sure nice talking to you, Dad.
It’s been sure nice talking to you.”

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He’d grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

Ray Davies,"Ooh, Darling, what can I do
I feel so afraid, and even my friends don't know what to say
That's why I'm asking you

I'm so afraid
I know I should be strong
But when affection is gone, it's hard to face each day
Knowing love has drifted away

Somehow I can't hide the pain
Is he going to come back again

Dear Lonely Heart
I wish things could be the way that they were at the start
But you must face the fact
If he's going to leave there's no way that you'll win him back

You got to try to hold back the tears
Don't give into your fears

Darling, I'm so afraid
I can get through the night
But when affection is gone, it's hard to face each day
Oh will he please come home

Dear Lonely Heart, dear Lonely Heart
Dear Lonely Heart
I wish things could be the way that they were at the start
But you must face the fact
If he's going to leave there's no way that you'll win him back
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I can get through the night

Ray Davies,"Have you seen this face
Does it ring a bell
Does it strike a chord somewhere in your mind
And there's a big reward
If you help us solve this crime
And if you recognize this face, dial 999

Have you seen this face
Dig deep in your mind
Has anybody seen that little girl of mine
She was always a rover
But I'm afraid to say she's strayed
Too far this time

Now I'm sitting at home, staring at the wall
Waiting for the missing person to call
Waiting for the message I'm dreading to hear
Waiting to confirm my darkest fears
She's a missing person, I wish I could see
All of the places she might be
Maybe I stopped her from being free
Maybe there was something missing in me

Wherever she is, I hope she's doing fine
But I wish that she would phone or drop us a line
Till then I've got nothing to ease my mind
And I'm thinking about her all the time",Missing Persons

They're gonna segregate the people,
They're gonna put you in your place.
And no one's gonna listen when you try to plead your case.
And those who think they are immune will get slapped in the face.

Ray Davies,"It was clear to everybody in the family that as a cripple I was a complete
Failure. I did no better at college, actually. I went to the Hornsey College
Of Art. Hornsey, with the emphasis on horn.
But being at Art College in the mid till late sixties was quite an experience.
Everything was changing in Britain: fashion, style, art, theater.
But the thing I enjoyed most about Art College were the chicks.
Exactly. Don't think of me as crumpet man, do you? Do you?
But there was one chick in particular. She was in the sculpture
Department. She was a complete goddess. She was like one of these
Continental film stars. Her body was shaped like a Gretch country
Gentleman guitar. But like a Gretch country gentleman, she was too
Expensive for me.
But every night I persevered. I carried her easel up the stairs to her bedsit.
All these stairs to this attic apartment. But once I was inside her bedsit
I'd sit down and talk to her about politics, art, literature, ...revolution!
The usual crap, do you know what I mean? And this girl would lean
Against the refrigerator, sip her cocoa and stare at me as if to say
""You can talk all the bullshit you want. You ain't gonna get anywhere
With me"". And she was right, so I like to dedicate this next piece
To that wonderful prick-teaser of my youth.",Art School (Dialogue)
Ray Davies,"My art school babe with your palette-knives and brushes
Painted face, Egyptian eye-brows and bright red lips
Pale white make-up, tight black skirts like Juliette Greco
And there's me quoting pretentious chat up lines
From Marcel Proust, Jean Cocteau and Jean-Paul Sartre
Sitting by a gasfire in a drafty bedsit
The art school babe quotes William Blake and she rolls a joint
And I think ""Oh oh, I've scored"", start to make myself at home
But the room starts moving as she starts to get me stoned
I close my eyes and give in, the room goes in a spin
My lips are dry, I wander around with a ridiculous grin
I grovel on the floor, I think ""Yeah I think I can make her""
Then I wake up and realize I've been kissing the refrigerator
Art school chaps with creative grand illusions
My sketch pad at the ready, my eager charcoal in my hand
Boring the world for hours with political theories
Just to impress anyone who listens while my art school babe
Just puts another inch of make-up on her face
And she says to me:
""Arty farty, you'll never fool your Auntie
Who knew you when you picked your nose and wet your pants""
How did she know that?
Arty farty, I try to throw a party
To impress my peers I struck a creative stance
Art school cat, ah, I was really on a mission
I made my play for my art school babe
By humming jazz tunes with words by Ferlinghetti

Ray Davies,"Got back to the front room, Dave was plugged in to the green amplifier
Pete was on the bass, they sounded great
Dave had this great way of playing the guitar
The way Dave played was very individual
I'd been overwhelmed by all the culture
Art School prays the life I'd never really understand
I sat down and started to jam,
Was astounded by the speed of Dave's hands
The way Dave played guitar was very similar to the way he spoke
Exactly
I thought to myself ""This is the way it's gonna be.
I'm gonna join this band, leave college behind.
Forget culture, rock 'n' roll is where it's at""
And daytime was dawning
We were up all night, we were all yawning
But we were playing, raving
Sometimes so loud, to the early morning
Our friends keep knocking at the door
The neighbours shouted out ""No more""
They even sent the police around to hear us play
And this is the way we played
We thought ""If we could annoy all of the neighbours with the green amp
Think of what we could do with a four piece band""
But there was no doubt Dave was the star,
A connoisseur of the old twelve bar
And even dad said ""That boy is bloody marvelous""
As I said Pete was on the bass,
So the only way I could SLY my way into the band
Was to become the rhythm guitar player
While we were bouncing up and down
The house was shaking to the sound
Of the full distortion from the gramophone
We had stayed up playing all night long
Ran out of other people's songs
So we started making music of our own
And dawn was breaking, my mind was calculating
This time there's no more waiting
I was awake, my mind was clear
I could see a way out of here
And then the cops knocked at the door
With letters from solicitors
We'd disturb the peace and woke up all the neighbours
But dad says ""Forget the neighbours.
Keep playing, boys, keep playing""",Back in the Front Room

Ray Davies,"My name is of no importance. You see, I'm a product of a century
Which started at the height of class-conscious imperialism and ended
With a society so reduced to totalitarian commonness that in my final
Years at college the saying 'mediocrity rises' became very popular.
And being mediocre, I rose. But you're not supposed to laugh at that.
My generation has been taught to be so in touch with the latest fashion
That we have become faceless; we're victims of design.
But, oddly enough, although I was taught to think of myself as a man
With no face, somewhere inside my soul I believe that one day

Then I called Dave in from the kitchen where he was having dinner

To the green amp. He started playing along with the riff I was playing

To listen to it. Mum hovered around by the door, half afraid that the

Ray Davies,"It was back to the drawing board, and I think it was out of frustration
We wanted to sound as distorted as Chuck Berry's guitar on Memphis
Tennessee. We played the record so many times on that old radiogram
And so loud, that some of the speakers were crackling in the radiogram,

Completely distorted. And the valves were rattling in the machine.
So, in fact, you know, God save the Queen sounded like Chuck Berry.
Everything sounded really distorted. And Dave and I thought
""How can we make the green amp sound that distorted?"".

So Dave took one of mums knitting-needles and he stuck it into the
Speakers of the little green amp. The Dave played a chord. Pfft.
It sounded great, yes! Brilliant. That's the sound.
Dave rechristened the green amp ""the fart box"".

Now as I said the front room was a place where we had celebrations
Usually, singsongs.
When we very young, when I was 13 years old, our oldest sister came
Back from Canada where she had emigrated after the war and she died

In tragic circumstances. So at the age of 30 she was burried and we had
A new experience in the front room: a wake.
But Dave and I were surprised that these adults, still drinking and singing
Songs. We thought that was odd as they were all dressed in black,

That it was a sad time.
It's hard to describe the front room. It had a really magical quality to it,
Really spiritual in a way. I went to a church school, but the closest I felt to
Religion was not when I was singing in the school choir or when I was at

Sunday school which I always went to. But it was more when I rehearsed
With Dave in the front room.",The Front Room
Ray Davies,"And as I walked round those tidy streets I thought to myself
""How can anybody be at all unhappy in such a perfect world?""
How wrong I was!
There's a little hunchback man, he used to walk round the streets
Of North London. His head was bowed, forced to look at the ground by
This cruel, debilitating hump on his back. And all of my school friends
Had a name for this hunchback. They called him the freak.
And every time the freak walked down the street my friends would laugh
And I laughed with them.
Now my dad was a sports fan. But in order to achieve all the ambitions
My father had for me, I trained really hard and eventually I became the

Captain of the school team, until one cold winters afternoon I sustained
An injury. Actually it was kick up the arse, but ... hey.
I was sent to a specialist and he took x-rays of my back, examined me
And he said ""Well you're gonna have to give up all sport for all time,
Otherwise you're going to end up a hunchback like that man I see you
Laughing at"".
Maybe that was meant to scare me, I don't know, but all of a sudden I
Started to look at that freak in a new light, because in him I saw my future.
I would become a freak.
But we all know that ugliness, like beauty, is only skin deep.",Hunchback
Ray Davies,"The phone rang, it was a call from Larry. ""Hello, cock. Cock, it's time for
The third single"". If this is a flop, if the third single doesn't make it, our
Career would be over. I'd written another song that we played on stage
Quite a lot. It was called You really got me. And the audiences loved it,

No, the audiences loved it. They liked it because they could dance to it.
But the record company hated it. They said ""You can't record that piece
Of rubish. And we don't like the sound of that terrible distorted green
Amplifier. No, no. You can't record it, that's final"". But Robert and

Grenville thought it was marvelous. ""Don't you think so, Grenville?"".
""Oh, every time they play 'You really got me' I get shivers up my spine"".
""I think it's a hit, cock, I gotta tell ya, I'll state my reputation on it"".
Now, with management like that, how could we fail?

But the record company said ""Look, we don't believe in it. We're very
Sorry, we don't believe in it. If you want to make the record, fine, but you
Have to pay for the recording yourselves"". And that was really cruel,
Because they knew we were broke. But Robert knew a man.

""Here, Ray, here's 200 quid. Go in the bloody studio and make that
Record. And make sure it's a bloody hit, what?"".
You see, Mick Avory hadn't signed the recording contract, and they said
He couldn't play on the record. We'd have to get a session drummer in,

He's a guy that'd come in and play for hire. And they said this thinking
That we'd be loyal to Mick and cancel the session. But we weren't
Gonna do that. But at the last minute we snug Mick into the studio.
He can only play tambourine, but at least he was on the record.

I'd written 'You really got me' as tribute to all those great blues people
I love: Leadbelly and Big Bill Broonzy. And Dave was playing the song
In the studio that day, but he was playing it in the style I'd written it.
But then Dave plugged the guitar into the green amp, and he plugged

The green amp into a Vox AC30, and it sounded hugh.
And when Dave played the opening chords to 'You really got me'
They were so loud that the session drummer forgot the complicated
Little patern he was gonna play at the beginning and just hit one beat

On the snare drum as loud as he could, pow, as if to say to Dave
""You noisy little bleeder. I can play just as loud as you can. And I've got
A big stick"". But that's exactly what we wanted, you see, we wanted to
Sound loud. Now we sounded like a group.

Halfway through the song it was time for Dave's guitar solo.
This moment had to be right. So I shouted across the studio to Dave,
Give him encouragement. But I seemed to spoil his concentration.
He looked at me with a dazed expression. ""Fuck off"".

If you doubt me, if you doubt what I'm saying, I challenge you to listen
To the original Kinks recording of 'You really got me'.
Halfway through the song, after the second chorus, before the guitar
Solo, there's a drum break. Boo ka, boo boo ka, boo ka, boo boo.

And in the background you can hear ""fuckoff"". You can, you can.
When I did the vocal I tried to cover it up by going ""Oh no"", but in the
Background you still hear it ""fuckoff"". And it's even clearer on CD,
It's really embarrassing.

Well then Dave looked like you'd done something wrong, his mouth
Relaxed and his jaw dropped. But it was halfway through the most
Important track we'd ever do. And if it wasn't a hit, it would be the last
Track we'd ever do. And the lead guitarist stops playing before the solo.

But then Dave's eyes squinted and his face broke into that arrogant
Sideways grin I've learnt to love and hate over the years. You see,
He hadn't heard me shout at all. He just thought of looking at me
At the same time as I looked at him, a kind of telepathic way of saying

""This is it, remember, the front room"". Then he gritted his teeth and
Sneered at me one more time and cocked an attitude before turning
Away into the corner of the studio to play himself into rock 'n' roll history.",The Third Single
Ray Davies,"Are you going on Thanksgiving Day
To those family celebrations?
Passing on knowledge down through the years
At the gathering of generations

Every year it's the same routine
All over, all over
Come on over, it's the Thanksgiving Day

Papa looks over at the small gathering
Remembering days gone by
Smiles at the children as he watches them play
And wishes his wife was still by his side

She would always cook dinner on Thanksgiving Day
It's all over, it's all over, it's all over the American way
But sometimes the children are so far away

And in a dark apartment on the wrong side of town
A lonely spinster prays
For a handsome lover and a passionate embrace
And kisses all over, all over, all over her American face
It's all over, it's all over, it's all over

'Cause today she feels so far away
From the friends in her hometown
So she runs for the Greyhound
She'll spend hours on the bus
But she'll reach town for Thanksgiving Day

Come on over, come on over
Come on over, it's Thanksgiving Day
Come on over, come on over
Come on over, come on over
Come on over, it's Thanksgiving Day

At a truck stop a man sits alone at the bar
Estranged in isolation
It's been a while now and he seems so far
From those distant celebrations

He thinks back to all the mistakes that he made
To a time when he was so young and green
Innocent days when they both looked forward to that
Great American dream

Now it's all over, it's all over, all over
And all over America people are going home
On Thanksgiving Day

Now Papa looks out of the window
The sight brings a smile to his face
He sees all his children coming back home
Together on this special day

Come on over, come on over
Come on over, it's Thanksgiving Day
Come on over, come on over
Come on over, it's Thanksgiving Day

Ray Davies,"Dear sir or madam, I don't normally write to the press

Society is crumbling but the media's obsessed with boobs, bums

That throne of kings, that sceptred isle set in a silver sea
Has turned into a laughing stock divided without harmony

That's why I remain yours truly, confused N10

While Mercs and Posches double park with sheer impunity
When towed away the ponces plead to all and sundry

Ray Davies,"I just had a really bad fall
And this time it was harder to get up than before
I shouted to the heavens and a vision appeared
I cried out ""Can you help?"", it replied ""Not at all""

After the fall is over
You'll be on your own
After the fall is over

There'll be wrecks to clear in this war zone
There'll be much to clean and time to atone
But while it's dark you can shelter here
In the bleak midwinter when you're feeling the fear
Ah, but when the mist clears, the sun will shine again

A life's gotta have direction
After the deals are done
You gotta ask the question

Ask yourself why you go through it all
When morality kicks in, who will catch you when you fall
I'm a sinner waiting at the traveler's rest
Seeking refuge from the storm, and I'm a grateful guest
And a profit cries out in high platitudes
I smile and say, ""Hey, I was just passing through""
And an angel cries, ""Wait, we'll tell you when to move""
Even at the gates of Heaven I'll be waiting in a queue

Seems like I'm falling upwards
Into the great white blue
And all my imperfections

You can learn your lines and fabricate a show
But the way we come in, yeah, that's the way we're gonna go
We cheat and lie to conquer our fears
We can put on a smile just to cover up the tears
Ah, but when the mist clears, the sun will shine again

After the fall (after the fall is over)
There'll be a better day
After the fall is over

So I fell on my arse, now I'm feeling the pain
But the feeling will pass and so will the shame
The bigger the ego, the bigger the fall
When your reputation counts for nothing at all
Ah, but when the mist clears, the sun will shine again

I will greet you when the sun shines again

Make yourself a cuppa tea
Drag your emotions out of the gutter
Don't wallow in self pity

When you wake up, all of a fluster
Thinking life has passed you by
Give yourself a kick up the backside
Jump out of bed and punch the sky

Is there life after breakfast
Full of possibilities
Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast
So don't live in agony
Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast

Cheer up son, put on the kettle
There's no point in being glum
Make your mind up, try to forget her
Boil the tea and I'll be mum

Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast
So don't live in agony
Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast

After breakfast

Just because all of the plumbing
Isn't all it used to be
Turn the tap, see, a little bit's coming
That must make you feel relieved

Don't turn into a total embarrassment
To your friends and family
Get out of bed, the whole day's ahead
So take the pills and drink your tea

Is there life after breakfast

Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast
So don't be so depressive

Get your health together
Get your wealth together

Mr. Brown, you're so ambitious
You ran off with an Essex blond
You've broke the bank to keep two women
You're over extended, now, it's all gone wrong

Now, you're right back where you started
Still, you shouldn't be broken hearted

Get your mind together
We can still climb together
A step at a time together
Brown, your world was turned upside down

I know it's not the same
And everything changes
But behind front doors people think that they can hide

We win and lose, we laugh and cry
Live and learn, at least we try
Oh, give it a try

With empty factories in Birmingham

Looks like we're in for heavy weather

In the name of globalization

Ray Davies,"Looking for the working man's café
In the shopping center of the town
Looking for somewhere to fit in
In among the retail outlets

Bought a pair of new designer pants
Where the fruit and veg man used to stand
I always used to see him there
Selling old apples and pears

Chatting up the pretty girls
With knocked off goods in the van

Don't you know he was a working man
Long ago he was a working man
And we sat in the working man's café
The working man's café

Everything around me seems unreal
Everywhere I go it looks and feels like America
We've really come a long way down this road
Improving our surroundings as we go
Changing our roots and culture
But don't you know

Long ago there was a working man
Don't you know we were all working men
And we'd sit and pass the time of day
At the working man's café

I thought I knew you then but will I know you now?
There's gotta be a place for us to meet
I'll call you when I've found it
I only hope that life has made us a little more grounded
Hey man, I see you now.

Oh oh, we were all working men
And here we are at the working man's café

It's really good to see us come so far
But haven't we forgotten who we are
Taking out a larger loan
Equity relief and mortgages

We all seem to pass the time of day
Online at the internet cafe
And if you forget my face
In case you've forgotten just who I am
I'm the kid with the greasy spoon
Firmly held in my hand

Don't you know I was a working man
Long ago we were all working men
And we sat and spent the time of day
At the working man's café
Yeah, at the working man's café",Working Mans Café
Ray Davies,"I don't believe that God is a man with white hair
Sitting in a big chair
Judging the world and its morals
Forgiving today so we can sin again tomorrow

But I believe I need something to look up to
I believe I wanna pray but don't know what to

I'm not a born again preacher
My soul's too far gone to be saved
The world is wild and at this stage
We need a hymn for a new age

Oh have you heard the news
Bible bashers where are the queues
A saint played a gig but he got crap reviews
The punters didn't like the product or the venue

I need something to connect to
Someone to help me through
Something I can pray to

This is my hymn for a new age
Rewrite the book on a fresh page
If I'm to find God and be saved
I need a hymn for a new age

(We need a hymn for a new age)

The invader's arrived now here comes the war
Satan keeps knocking at my door
Time has come for a new crusade
Cast out the evil before they blow the world away

We need a hymn
I believe
I need something to look up to
I believe I wanna pray but don't know what to

We need a hymn for a new age

If I'm to find God and be saved
I need a hymn for a new age

Ray Davies,"Is this really it?
Is this the final station
It's really been quite a trip

You know it's been great to watch the sights
Playing the edited highlights
And all the outtakes you did not see
Were only my unreality

[Chorus]
I am, I am imaginary
I am, I am imaginary
I'm the imaginary man
Imaginary man, yes I am
Imaginary, imaginary

I was always in your head
To raise your expectations
And always let it be said

I offered my very best to you
Gave you my dreams to aspire to
Involved you in all my crazy schemes
And took you to places you'd never seen

Walked down to Preservation Hall
Looking for the old rad band
It was just a momentary glance

I saw my reflection in the glass
Watched as the world went flashing past
I knew the face but could not tell
Why I couldn't recognize myself

Imaginary man, yes I am

Ray Davies,"Sunlight and the city is barely awake
As all the early morning drifters make their way
Headlights in the distance too bright for my eyes
Still I love the dusk, the dawn, between times
They are mine

'Cos you can't tell if it's day or night
Do we see the moon or the sunlight?
Everything around is so transitional
Momentary lapse of rational

Walking past the writing on the wall
Something apocalyptic
Then a momentary lapse of faith
Before I become more optimistic

Like a momentary loss of sight
Fleetingly it went so wrong from right
In a second it can change from night to day
Any second love can turn to hate

Sunlight and the city is barely awake
As all the seconds in our lifetime drift away
So live every moment and hold me so tight
A second changes day to night

I had a momentary loss of sight
Fleetingly it went so wrong from right
In a second you would change your point of view
In my hesitation I lost you

It only takes a moment sometimes
The difference between joy and pain
In a second you can look away
Turn around to find it's all changed

Because you can't tell if it's day or night
Do we see the moon or the sunlight?
Everything around is so transitional
Momentary loss of rational

Like a momentary loss of sight
Fleetingly it went from dark to light
In a second it can change from night to day
But in a moment hope will find the way",In a Moment

Yeah, all fall down someone help me off of the ground
Listen to my heartbeat
Yeah, all fall down someone help me off of the ground

Nelson and Starr
He's got ten grandkids, she's the third missus
He grooves around intensive care, strutting his stuff
He's got a perfect mullet hanging down his back
And Starr walks in, gives a little wiggle
Makes old Nelson grin
He tucks me in, touches my feet
""Hey buddy, you know you got a slow heartbeat""

Listen to my heartbeat
Yeah, listen to my heartbeat
And the marching band plays along
Plays the morphine song on the charity ward
Yeah the marching band plays its song

Yeah, all fall down someone help me off of the ground
Yeah, all fall down someone help me off of the ground

And opposite me Brenda the alkie coughs so deep
It's the drugs and the drink
It could happen to anyone
Sure makes me think
And the bed beside her is full of cables and leads
Nobody visits, nobody grieves

Listen to my heartbeat
Yeah, listen to my heartbeat

Nelson and Starr
He's got ten grandkids, she's the third missus
Starr takes some blood out of my arm
Rolls me over just like that
Listen to my heartbeat, slow but clean
While Brenda the alkie looks so mean
They wheel her out, she starts to cry
""If I don't get better, I'm gonna die
I'll go cold turkey till I'm clean
I'll go to jail but you get the morphine""

Ray Davies,"Why is it difficult to get things done
In the age of computers and communication?
The powers that be say they can't keep a hold
Of a world that is escalating out of control

Out on the street there's a war going on
And everything is going wild
But a bureaucrat says, ""We've lost your file
So we'll put you on hold for a while""

Hey man, call the D.A.
Call the National Guard, call the president
Call anyone in the land of the free
'Cause they ain't gonna listen to me

Call the P.D., the emergency ?vacuation
The Dalai Lama, Kofi Annan
And they ain't gonna listen to me

The voice on the phone says, 'We'll get right back'
But they say all the computers are down
And the chief prosecutor had to go out of town
No one listen, nobody listens, no one listens to me

Now we've got you in the system
Somebody's gonna get back to you
Then in a few more years we'll give your case a review
No one listen, nobody listens, they ain't gonna listen to me

Hey man, call the Government
Write to City Hall, United Nations
Tell the preacher at the missionary
'Cause they ain't gonna listen to me

Blame the hurricane, blame the drug trade, the economy
Blame the ghettos in the land of the free
'Cause they ain't gonna listen to me
They ain't gonna listen to me

Everybody knows it's a cryin' shame
How the little guy gets kicked around
Everybody I talk to agrees that if you wanna get heard
It's connections that count

I was minding my business
When a bad situation occurred, shock, horror and fear
Now the outcome is still unclear
Hey man, I am the innocent party here
They ain't gonna listen to me

Tell the National Guard
Tell the talk show on the TV
Tell the winos in the old man bar
?Cause they ain't gonna listen to me

Now I'm stuck here in their system
They ain't gonna listen, nobody listens
They ain't gonna listen to me

Ray Davies,"I was walking on the coast road
When the harbor came in view
It was there I saw the hilltop
That I used to walk with you

We'd sing of the old country
Now it's such a lonesome climb
Our world faded once when you were mine

Why is true love so difficult to find
Wish you were here to see it with me
One more time
Lalalala lalalala lalalala lala
Wish you were here to sing it with me
One more time

Those economic vultures
Stole our dreams and told us tales
Then they towed away our culture
To their depot in south Wales

Corporations get the tax breaks
While the city gets the crime
The profit's going somewhere
But it isn't yours or mine

Still we blindly trust in the divine
Let's sing for the old country
Come on, one more time
Lalalala lalalala lalalala oh oh
Let's sing it loud with feeling
Come on, one more time

You know I must be leaving
And I know you've got to stay
But you know that I'll be grieving
When you're so far away

And if this should be the last time
I should ever see your face
Let's part with no hard feeling
And a positive embrace

And I will speak well of you
When they ask when you were mine
Till then the jet stream up above
Shows us the warning signs

Till we meet again bravely walk the line

Ray Davies,"Hey girl let's begin again and try to help ourselves
We're like weary warriors who just came back from hell
You can keep your territory, I will stay in mine
Carefully negotiate and leave this battleground behind

All we deserve is some peace in our time
Unconditional love is better
Peace in our time

And it really doesn't matter
'Cos the world keeps going round
Just like a roller coaster
If you let it, it will crush you down

All we deserve is some peace in our time
I don't need no sympathy
Just some peace of mind

The two of us can't take it
Gotta have a truce so we can start
To pull it back together
Otherwise we're gonna fall apart

I'm tearing up the bunch of angry letters that you sent
The living room's a wreck from all the rows
The atmosphere is stifled with aggression
Ultimatums, deadlines and depression

Oh we both deserve a better life
This friction's killing me
Don't want to be a Buddhist but I need some peace and harmony and

All that I ask is some peace in my time
A little bit of understanding peace in our time

And I know that we can make it
But we gotta compromise
Don't want no more division
So end this war and live our lives

Ray Davies,"You danced and partied at the Mardi Gras
Threw back all the beads at the parade
Fake worlds and logos in the shopping mall
Where you came from
Everything seemed the same the whole world now

So you headed down south
Left your old home town
Relocated so far away from the real world
But where is the real world?

Get out of the bar
And follow the stars
Now you've relocated so far away from the real world
But where is the real world?

Ambitious eyes set firmly on the future
So keen to leave your old home town
But you're a lost soul looking for the
Great illusion in another state
You had to escape you know you just couldn't
Wait you thought the real world let you down.

So you headed down south left another home town
Now you don't have the time to think
Who's left behind in the real world
Watching game shows all day was no kind of deal
It all seemed oh so surreal
Had to break from the real world
But where is the real world?
One day you'll wake up and you will feel
""I am alive this is real""

Your friends came down to visit from all over
To see first hand the brand new start you made
But you were overqualified for the tips you
Earn in a bar
It won't work here and it didn't work there but
You tried it anyway

So head off in the car and follow the stars
There's someone waiting not far away
In the real world
Hope you get there this time
But just bear in mind
There's a lot of lost souls looking out
For a sign for the real world
But where is the real world?

One day you'll wake up and you will feel

Or the zombie walk, like an old soft shoe

Or zombie people or demons with pointy ears
Ain't no spooks waiting to appear

Ray Davies,"Lola
I met her in a club down in old Soho,
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry-cola,
C-O-L-A cola,
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance,
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola,
L-O-L-A Lola la-la-la-la Lola

Well I'm not the world's most physical guy,
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine,
Oh my Lola la-la-la-la Lola.

Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand,
Why she walked like a woman and talked like a man,

Well we drank champagne and danced all night,
Under electric candlelight,
She picked me up and sat me on her knee,
And said dear boy won't you come home with me,

Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy,
But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola,

I pushed her away,
I walked to the door,
I fell to the floor,
I got down on my knees,
Then I looked at her and she at me,
Well that's the way that I want it to stay,
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola.

Well I left home just a week before,
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before,
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand,
And said dear boy I'm gonna make you a man.

Girls will be boys and boys will be girls,

That money buys everything
And you think you need no one to guide you

You've come a long way, you're self-assured and dressed in
Funny clothes, but you don't know me.

Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.

Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You?

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

Is in your eyes

Well it takes my breath away

Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go

Ray Hamilton,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

You went and saved the best for last",Save the Best for Last

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

I will be remembering

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

He knows when you're a wake

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Just like a child without a home

You're my first love, you're my last
You're my future, you're my past
And loving you is all I ask, honey
All I ever need is you
Winters come and they go, and we watch the melting snow
Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you
Some men follow rainbows, I am told
Some men search for silver some for gold
I have found my treasure in your soul, honey

When will I see your face
Why do you just elude me
And leave me this lonely space

Ray Herndon,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

My car wit the windows down just think about you, I'm trippin.

From the way I introduced myself, she knew that I was stakin wealth
She wasn't in it for the dollars she had doe herself
I pulled up in my dirty ass Lexo, girl I've been workin hard so what you expect yo
She smiled and laughed and just that fast the way she made me feel had me trippin man
I think I felt this way befo', but see that girl wasn't feelin me so dat don't count yo
This mommy that I'm talkin bout she kind of light brown yo, 
The type to make me wear my seat belt and say baby please drive slow, 
Her ex man she (pause) she had to let him know
She don't need yo stress now 'cause she know I got dro, 
I think Ray J's the one you should
Fall fo' you have no idea how good I'll make ya feel, 
Everything will be great and I'll always keep it real, 
So hop up in the driver's seat and dip on these chrome wheels

She's got me doin things I can't believe
And I don't know what to do about it baby

I can't fake it love, 'cause everytime I open my eyes I picture me and you wakin up,
She alway's teasin me doin that sexy stuff, now it's goin up and down and down and up
Sometimes she wears weaves and got a nice round butt, 
She like to smoke weed and not talk to much, 
She let me be me and not givin a fuck, and maybe one day 
I'll get her finger froze up, will see when we get older (older), 
But now I'm doin it Prince style
With the mink fox on my shoulders, ""Heat"" tucked in my tux pushin a VT ?, 
She's always on my mind that's why I know she's controlin' me, 
She like's kissin and holdin me
And she real cool with my Moms and Brandy, 
My Pops and the rest of the family, that's another reason 
I thought she was right for me

Ray J,"[Verse 1]
What is it you want from me
I'm tired of playin games baby
Do you think
That I would sit around and play the fool
When its really up to me
Basically do what I please
And you think
That your the one controlling everything

[Bridge]
At first I was so big on you
Then you started to change
You begin to play these games
Never thinkin you would be the one to lose
Now your tellin me what your gonna do
I'm tellin you to tell the truth
But you see I'm through with you
Coz you tried to play me
And that just ain't cool

[Chorus]
If I owed you
What would you do do
You thought that I'd be
So caught up in you
You thought that I
Couldn't do what I had to
But this ain't a game
Now you tell me who's playin who you
Thought that i would be some kind of fool who
But I jus go and do what I had to
But his ain't a game

[Verse 2]
I duno what makes you think
I would be the type of guy
Who would be
So forgiving after dark baby
If you wana play with me
Always messing with my head maybe
You'd be
Spending the best of your life with me

Now that you know that I'm 
Not the one to play
Keep my respect n I'm
Over you
I don't understand why you
Play to lose
I can't believe that you
Would play me
You had me fooled
Thinking I could put my trust in you
But you jus can't show me you
Had the best of me, so baby plz
Stop thinking that you could handle me

I still know is you just by your touch

And all of the things that you did for me 
All of these things just let me know you care 
And all of the things that you got for me 
All of the things that you stop for me 
All of these things just let me know you care

Yes you do 
And it feel's so good

So I brushed up like whats up 
So her jeans was tight as what

3am club is packed 
Sure by now she's feelin' that 
I might go and take her home 
Yea she knew I made it known 
Sweat drippin' down her face 
Took my mind to a different place 
Club was cool 
If I had my way yea we'd be at my place 
Krazzi how she was down 
Looked at me and said lets bounce 
Gt coupe in velor 
Looked at her and said swell huh 
Then we started to roll out 
Almost to my crib and she's down 
For whateva' you know I'm down 
Yea she'll be sweatin' for me now 
Come on 

[Chorus]

Woke up in the mornin'
And I washed my face 
Had hoochies in my bed 
3 by the fire place 
Another 4 on the rug 
And they keepin' on touch 
Everybody do the snake 
Wen they fuckin' wit us 
Now chicks love me 
Well at least they say so 
Or maybe its the money 
Or the sweet 
See I dun give a fuck 
I just leave and replace hoes 
And everyone's a playa'
But believe me they ain't Joe 

Stains on my shirt 
And its not from that club 
Ray j dunno how to act 
You can if you feel me 
We can rock away 
I just wanna make ya sweat 
Y'all feel me 
Right around tha world 
From east to west coasts 
Gonna make sure y'all go home 
And change clothes 
But now we just want you're clothes to be soaked 
And if you can't take it 
Undress on the dance floor 

Oh keep sweatin'
Uh uh keep sweatin'

Ray J,"Yeah, Melody 
I just wish that I could hold you 
While you're slipping through my fingers, as I'm playing the piano, 
What is that sound it sounds so beautiful 
And I just wanna be close to you 
Close enough that I can feel you 
I'm already wondering where you are 
And it sounds like it's coming from my guitar. 

[Chorus]
Melody, said that I love you 
Melody, said that I adore you 
Melody, said that I need you 
You can call me foolish and I might be but I'm in love with a melody. 

Donnie and Stevie they can write you 
Now you come humming in my write too 
As the music's playing in my radio 
I hear that sound it sounds so beautiful 
It makes me wanna just embrace you 
Your close enough that I can taste you 
I know just where you are c'ause your right here next to me. 

[Chorus]",Melody
Ray J,"Damn baby,
I just don't understand were we went wrong,
I gave you my heart,
I gave you my soul,
I gave you...

As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first.
It was about 8 yrs ago, don't act like you don't know.
We're were sitting at home in your mama's living room
'Cause we couldn't be alone Ã¢?? you see

Your mama knew I was something else she knew how I felt.
Back then we were in school, and that's your favorite excuse.
See growing up I was a fool and I can't lie I'm missing you.
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it, here's my wish list.

First one, I would create a heart changing love,
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up,
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'd be okay if I get one.
If I had one wish, we would be best friends, love would never end, it would just begin.
If I had one wish, you would be my boo, promise to love you, trust me I trust you.
If I had one wish, we would run away, making love all day, have us a baby.
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life and you'd be my wife, make it right this time.

If I had one wish,
One wish, one wish,
One wish, one wish,
One wish, one wish,
One wish, one wish,
One wish, one wish,
One wish, one wish.

Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in?
If so then search and I'll go. Then I can have you for sho, then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing, me Ã¢?? so girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe. I swear if I lose a second chance with you, I wouldn't know what to do. I'd probably check myself into some kind of clinic. I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick.
Here's my wish list:

First one, I would create a heart changing love,
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all the way up,
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'd be okay if I get one.
If I had one wish we would be best friends, love would never end, it would just begin.
(Starting here right now)
If I had one wish, you would be my boo, promise to love you (promise love) trust me I trust you. (I'll trust you)
If I had one wish, we would run away (yes we would), making love all day,
(feel so good) have us a baby.

If I had one wish,
I'd (make you my whole life) make you my whole life and you'd be my wife,
Make it right this time, if I had one wish.

I don't even know how we ended upon this road;
And, even though we are grown, girl I just want you to know.

If I had one wish, we would be best friends, love would never end, it would just begin.
If I had one wish, you would be my boo, promise to love you, trust me I trust you.
If I had one wish, we would run away, making love all day, have us a baby.
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life and you'd be my wife, make it right this time.

If I had one wish,
One wish, one wish,
One wish, one wish,
One wish, one wish,
One wish, one wish,

Here some courage and some wisdom 
As you go on life's mission 
Hope you make the right decisions 
Although life's just an illusion 
People get locked up 
Some start using 
While the government is recruitin' 
They trainin' more soldiers to go out and do it 

[Chorus x2]
But when the war is over 
You won't have to worry no more 
When the war is over 
You won't have to cry on my shoulder 

When we need it 
It's time for freedom 
No more voices 
We can beat em' 
Stand together fight the struggle 
Take our justice to another level 
Your mistakes please don't repeat em' 
All your goals you can achieve them 
When they tell you no don't believe them 
All your enemies you can defeat em' 

[Chorus x2]

We just gotta walk away 
And pray that it will be okay 
Know there will be brighter day's 
See when you little kids get older 
Think of what your elders told ya 
Remember all the fallen soldiers 
When the war is over

Everything is meant to be 
It will all go down in history 
Just be proud of your family 
When the war is over 
Well we're gonna make it through 
Forget about the things we do 
I just want peace with you 
When the war is over

Years and Feelings
Hopes and Wishes
How many of them we share
How many of them we dare
To show, To Grow
Promise not let it go
Now look, what we become
So gone now, And I don't even get it
How a love like ours could fall apart in one minute
I'm sleeping in a happy home
The next minute, I'm walking out an open door...

Trying to get myself together, Hoping I don't cry
Wanting to be together
But this feeling getting worse
Oh I never thought I ever feel this hurt

Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
So I'm hoping like hell that it ain't 4real
Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
Wishing that it ain't but I know that it is
2 days ago I felt like a star
2 hours ago just lost my heart
Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
It's all I feel, it's all I feel

Now I remember when I first knew ya
And I was all that had on your mind
Did I ever mean anything to ya
Or was I just something you did to pass the time
Cause now you won't hear me out
You ain't even tryin' to work it out
But I ain't going back
And even though I'm scared
I got too much pride

And no matter how you feel
She's gonna do what she will

Well I'm her boyfriend (boyfriend)

You don't beat it right
Makin' love is cool
Just pull her hair sometimes
She wants to feel like a lover
Not a touch from a brother
She wanna wake up body achin'
Not fall asleep frustrated
She said she loves it home
Its just somethin' sexy 'bout me
Though all the haters so
What you expect from shawty
Remember when you're gone away
That she'll always be safe with me

I was Present on the block but I was absent in the class
Ooh so hard for a young brother

I hardly saw my self and barely every saw my mother
I got in trouble everyday because I loved the drama
Didn't understand how my first name had changed to brandy's brother
I grew up 'Insight' of you Everybody Know 
I was a fool red laces in my tennis shoes

I blow money on my dead homies funerals
The critics say I'm out acting a fool 
I'm tired of being excused 
I'm putting out these sex tapes 
I'm just living my life
Just because I'm making money and my chain so bright 
I make the night time day cause my wrist so light

I don't wanna be right
I don't wanna be right
I don't wanna be right
I rather live a lonely life.",Don't Wanna Be Right (Intro)

Ray J,"Girl from the Bronx!

Yea I still love you baby?
Yo, yo, yo the story gets crazy 
But in the beginning the shit was all gravy 
My girlfriend she straight up from Brooklyn type of chick 

Just to kill another bitch just for looking 
She?s so Brooklyn she so crazy I swear to god man I love my baby, 
But you could always catch a nigga hanging out 
I was in the late night spot smoking out. 

That?s when I saw this girl she was leaning
She was kind of tipsy from the drink she was drinking, 
She was looking then she started winking, 
Thinking to my self man I probably shouldn?t be here 

I got her name then I got her number, 
I should be ashamed because I went home and called her, 
Now we on the phone telling me she older 
Said she from the Bronx and she want me to come over I was like?

[Chorus]
Dam I can?t believe I?dam I can?t believe I? dam I can?t believe I? dam I can?t believe I cheated on my woman with a girl from the Bronx

Man this shit gets deeper 
I hoped on the subway just to go meet her 
She was looking like a wannabe diva 
Freaky lil' bitch borderline skuzzier 

My girlfriend she wasn?t hesitating 
She blowing up my phone every second we was hanging 
She so inpatient, she?s on probation I swear to god man 
I love my baby but I always spend my time hanging out 

swap chilling with this hoe in the Bronx digging her out. 
Fucked her in the kitchen, hit it on the couch
I can?t forget to mention I put it in her mouth. 
And now it?s a long ride home I know I was so damn wrong

But dam I had so much fun. 
My girl kept calling my phone I?m thinking about what I?ve done.

[Chorus]

The next day I thought shit was all over 
But my girlfriend giving me the cold shoulder 
Said she found some empty condom rappers in the Rover 
Now she throwin' fits, telling me to go
Crying in the bed room burning all my cloths 
Taking all my shoes and put ?em on the stove 
All in the kitchen looks like a furnace
Ten minutes later whole house burning, 
And now you see me in a robe running out 
And you can here the police coming without a doubt 
The cops saw us fussing, my girl was tripping hard 
They locked me up in handcuffs threw me in the car, 
And now I know that It?s over 
I called her over and over 
she won?t answer my calls 
I thought my pimping days were over, I stood up only to fall.

[Chorus]

Dam I can?t believe 
I...dam I can?t believe 
I... dam I can?t believe 
I... dam I can?t believe cheated on my woman with a girl from the

And I know you think it's better to just leave and this is where I disagree
But I know I'm shooting with my words,
Except girl they only words,
You know my actions are louder then what you heard,
I'm tired of this arguing and I wish for one last thing,
It means the world to me.

'Cause I know what we got, even when you don't,
We rock baby 'til the wheels fall off, feel me?
It's real love and I still believe if I wish on one last thing,
Last call, last kiss baby just one last wish,
Last wrong, last slip baby just one last wish.

Been through it all, fought through the pain,
And our love's even stronger girl we can do it again,
And so that's all, and that's it baby just one last wish

Girl I'm sick and tired of deja vu
'Cause here we are again at the top of our lungs,
Till we both know we love harder then we give each other chance to see,
And every time I see tears it hurts,
Tell me is it really worth
You crying me lying it's absurd,
A better man is what I'm a be
So I wish for one last thing,
And that's you and me

'Cause I know what we got, even when you don't,
We rock baby 'til the wheels fall off, feel me?
It's real love and I still believe if I wish on one last thing,

Last wrong, last slip baby just one last wish.

Said we have been through it all, fought through the pain,
And our love's even stronger girl we can do it again,
And so that's all, and that's it baby just one last wish.

Damn if I could just wish for one last thing,
Oh baby we've been here before,
Got outta control then we let it go,
It's time that we pick it up and never have to sacrifice,
This a new setup, we can do it better,
Me and you against the world take over together,
Yeah that's how real love should be,
So baby one last call, last kiss, baby just one last wish,
Last wrong, last slip baby just one last wish,

I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it, I hit it first

I had her head going north and her ass going south
But now baby chose to go West
We deep in the building she know that I kill 'em
I know that I hit it the best
Candles lit with that wine, money still on my mind
And I gave her that really bomb sex
No matter where she goes or who she knows
She still belongs in my bed
Going hard in the streets, mobbin' with my homies
Sippin' on good, blowin' on OG

I bet I hit it first, unless you took that girl virginity

But I don't wanna be a player no more

And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes

(Michael)
As the years say good-bye
One by one on silent wings they fly
What will last, what is true
That's a lesson I learned lovin' you
This world will find its way somehow
I've got all that I need right here, right now


[CHORUS]
This is the time when the cold winds blow
When the snow falls from Heaven
On the dreamers below
Baby this is the time when I need to know
That your love will always be mine
Baby this is the time, Baby this is the time


(Wynonna)
Sometimes life leads you blind
To the one you've been waiting to find
Sometimes life lets you see
Just how great the gift of love can be
Now the light that fires the brightest stars
Is waiting to shine on this moment of ours


[CHORUS]


(Wynonna&Michael)
If life is just a dream, I know within my heart
Just getting closer to you
Is by far the sweetest part
So tell me one thing baby, the one thing I need to know

Ray Knighton,"There's a long line of mourners driving down our little street
Their fancy cars are such a sight to see
They're all of your rich friends who you knew in the city
And now they finally brought you home to me
When you left you told me someday you'd be returnin'
In a fancy car for all the town to see
Now everyone is watching you finally got your dream
You're riding in a long black limousine
The papers told of how you lost your life the party and the fatal crash that night
The race upon the highway the curve you didn't see
And now you're in that long black limousine
Through tear dimmed eyes I watch as you ride by
A chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine
I'll never love another my heart and all my dreams
Are with you in that long black limousine",Long Black Limousine

I ain't too proud to stay

And I'm so lonesome without you
And I can't get you out of my mind

With my soul sat down so tight it's like a stone cold tomb
Ain't it clear when I'm near you

I'm just dying to hear you
Calling my name one more time
Oh so don't pay no mind

To my watering eyes
Must be something in the air
That I'm breathing

Yes'n I try to ignore
All this blood on the floor
It's just this heart on my sleeve that's a bleeding

Oh mama don't walk away
You leave me here bereaving from the words so hard and plain
Saying the love that we had

Was just selfish and sad
To see you now with him
Is just making me mad

Oh so kiss him again
Just to prove to me that you can

Ray LaMontagne,"I lost all of my vanity
When I peered into the pool
I lost all of my innocence
When I fell in love with you
I never knew a man fall so far until I landed here
Where all of my wounds turn into gold when I kissed your hair

Come to me Hannah
Hannah won't you to come on to me
I'll lay down this bottle of wine
If you'll just be kind to me
Ask her why she cries so loud
She Will not say a word

She takes what she deserves 
To celebrate her emptiness 
In a Cold and lonely room

Sweep the floor with your long flowered dress
If you cannot find a broom
Come to me Hannah

Hannah won't you come on to me

Right down to the backs of her knees
Her Papa he was a preaching man
And the lord is hard to please

So she comes down from the ozark hills to these very streets to roam
With a banjo and a bible and a fine tooth comb
Come to me Hannah

Hannah won't you come on to me
I'll lay down this bottle of wine if you just be kind to me
I'd walk one mile on this broken glass
To fall down at your feet

Oh Hannah you're the queen of the street
I climb the tree withy my Hannahlee
My intentions they were pure
Oh the breeze did whip and I lost my grip
I tumbled towards the earth 
Where You never would guess who it was that stood below
And his name I would never tell 
But His eyes were clear
And His arms were strong
And caught me as I fell
Now come to me Hannah
Hannah won't you come on to me
I'll lay down this bottle of wine

Ray LaMontagne,"When you came to me with your bad dreams and your fears
It was easy to see that you'd been crying
Seems like everywhere you turn catastrophe it reigns
But who really profits from the dying
I could hold you in my arms
I could hold you forever
I could hold you in my arms
I could hold you in my arms forever

When you kissed my lips with my mouth so full of questions
It's my worried mind that you quiet
Place your hands on my face
Close my eyes and say
Love is a poor man's food
With no proper side
I could hold you in my arms
I could hold you forever
And I could hold you in my arms
I could hold you forever

So now we see how it is
This fist begets the spear
Weapons of war
Symptoms of madness
Don't let your eyes refuse to see
Don't let your ears refuse to hear

And she kissed him for love
She kissed him for luck

Walks through the garden rows
With her bare feet laughing

I never learned to count my blessings
I choose instead to dwell
In my disasters

I walk on down the hill
Through grass grown tall
And brown and still
It's hard somehow
To let go of my pain

On past the busted back 
Of that old and rusted Cadillac
That sinks into this field 
Collecting rain

Will I always feel this way
So empty
So estranged?

And of these cut throat busted sunsets
These cold and damp white mornings
I have grown weary

If through my cracked and dusty 
Dime store lips 
I spoke these words out loud 
Would no one hear me?

Lay your blouse across the chair
Let fall the flowers 
From your hair 
And kiss me
With that country mouth
So plain

Outside the rain is tapping
On the leaves 
To me it sounds like
They're applauding us
The quiet love
We've made

Will I always feel this way
So empty
So estranged?

Well I looked my demons in the eyes
Lay bare my chest
Said do your best
To destroy me

See I've been to hell and back

Like a hammer through the room
That I could choose another over her

That you never lost your grip
Oh, come on now
That's such a childish claim
Now I wear the brand of traitor
Don't it seem a bit absurd
When it's clear I was so obviously framed
When it's clear I was so obviously framed

Now you act so surprised
To hear what you already know
And all you really had to do was ask
I'd have told you straight away
All those lies were truth
And all that was false was fact

Now you hold me close and hard
But I was like a statue at most
Refusing to acknowledge you'd been hurt
Now you're clawing at my throat
And you're crying all is lost
But your tears they felt so hot upon my shirt
But your tears they felt so hot upon my shirt

Well the truth it fell so heavy
Like a hammer through the room
That I could choose another over her
You always said I was an actor, baby
Guess in truth you thought me just amateur

Was it you who told me once
Now looking back it seems surreal
That all our mistakes are merely grist for the mill
So why is it now after I had my fill
Would you steal from me the sorrow that I've earned

His possessions are his throne

Watching tv in the dark

Ray LaMontagne,"Hear me out Day follows day
Light turns to clay in my hands
How to explain,
So pristine the pain
It was kindness made the cut so clean
I still care for you
Hear me out
You wanted to me to be
Less your love than a mirror
Can't you see
What you mean to me? (even promises may bleed)
I still care for you
The hours grow
Heavy,
And hollow,
And cruel as a grave
Open Me
You'll find
Only bones burned to glass.
I still care for you",I Still Care for You
Ray LaMontagne,"There comes a time
A time in everyone's life
Where nothing seems to go your way
Where nothing seems to turn out right
There may come a time
You just can't seem to find your place
And for every door you open
Seems like you get two slammed in your face

That's when you need someone
Someone that you, you can call
When all your faith is gone
And it feels like you can't go on
Let it be me
Let it be me
If it's a friend that you need
Let it be me
Let it be me

Feels like you're always coming up last
Pockets full of nothing and you got no cash
No matter where you turn you ain't got no place to stand
You reach out for something and they slap your hand
Now, I remember all too well
Just how it feels to be all alone
You feel like you'd give anything
For just a little place you can call your own

That's when you need someone
Someone that you, you can call
When all your faith is gone
It feels like you cant go on
Let it be me
Let it be me
If it's a friend you need
Let it be me
Let it be me
Let it be me
Let it be me
If it's a friend you need

Ray LaMontagne,"When we first met we were kids, we were wild, we were insects
And after a while, I grew coarse, I grew cold, I grew reckless
I hold this memory, hold you so close to me, whispered were we always happy
Lately it feels like I'm asleep and I just can't wake up
Pacing the floor, want to call, but I can't so I hang up
Sharing a secret on the train with a lady who's crying has ruined her make up

Now I see just how young, how scared I was
Eyes closed tight, throwing punch after punch at the world
Sarah, is it ever gonna be the same
Sarah, is it ever gonna be the same

Said goodbye to all the places I used to go
Said goodbye to all the faces I used to know
Nothing lasts forever
I guess by now, I should know
I should know

There ain't a thing I can say that will ever repair
And you, who had so much advice, and yet couldn't share
Maybe someday, we will look back at this and we'll smile, but right now I can't bear

Ray LaMontagne,"It's the Widow now that owns that angry plow
The spartan Mule and The Crippled Cow
The fallow field that will yield no more
As the fox lay sleeping beneath her kitchen floor

The stream can't contain such the withering rain
And from the pasture the fence it is leaning away
The clouds crack and growl
Like some great cat on the prowl
Crying out, ""I am, I am"" over and over again

The days grow short
As the nights grow long
The kettle sings its tortured song
As many petaled kiss I place upon her brow
Oh, my lady, Lady I am loving you now

The winter birds have come back again
Here the sprightly Chickadee
Gone now is the Willow Wren
In passing greet each other as if old, old friends
And to the voiceless trees
It is their own they will lend

The days grow short
As the nights grow long
The kettle sings its tortured song
As many petaled kiss I place upon her brow
Oh, my lady, lady I am loving you now

And though all these things will change
The memories will remain
As green to gold, and gold to brown
The leaves will fall to feed the ground
And in their falling, make no sound

Oh my lady
Lady I am loving you now

I've gathered all my money and I'm goin' to town
To buy my lady a long and flowing gown

Everywhere I turned the doors were closin'
It took every ounce of faith I had to keep on keepin' on
And still I felt like I was only losin'

I refused then like I do now to let anybody tie me down
And I lost a few good friends along the way
I was raised up poor and I wanted more
And maybe I'm a little too proud
Lookin' back I see a kid who was just
Afraid, hungry and old before his time

Through the years I've known my share of broken hearted fools
And those who couldn't choose a path worth taking
There's nothin' in the world so sad as talking to a man
Who never knew his life was his for making

Ain't it about time you realize? It's not worth keepin' score
You win some, you lose some and you let it go
What's the use of stacking on every failure, another stone
Till you find you've spent your whole life building walls, 
Lonely and old before your time

It took so long to see
That truth was all around me

Now the wren has gone to roost and the sky is turnin' gold
Like the sky my soul is also turnin'
Turnin' from the past, at last and all I've left behind
Could it be that I am finally learnin'?

Learnin' that I'm deserving of love and the peaceful heart

And I don't know where the years had gone,
Just know I'm worse for hangin' on
Maybe it'd be best if I just let things lie
Guess I'm never gonna get back to Ojai

I knew a good man
He was a break in clouds,
Hangin'
So low down
It's got me to thinking
It's not like he gave in, he just
Never got that
Second win

Hitchin a ride down the PCH
I got some things I need to say
Callin' out a friend of mine

Just know I'm worse for hangin' on
Maybe it'd be best if I just let things lie
Guess I'm never gonna get back to Ojai

I've been a saviour,
A sideman, a stranger son
Hedge your wager,
'Cause life ain't fair

Sorely mistaken, this path
I've taken
It's goin' nowhere

Hitchin a ride down the PCH
I got some things I need to say
Callin' out a friend of mine

I don't know where the years have gone,
Just know I'm worse for hangin' on
Maybe it'd be best if I just let things lie

I wish somebody could tell me what's goin
On inside of my head
I got to find a doctor to figure out
What's goin on in my head
He said 'son can you tell me where it hurts'
This is all that I said

Feet falling out from under

But the oft told tale is not true,
For of all the things the Danube is,
The Danube is not blue.

The Danube is green,
What's more it ain't clean.
It's green as a bean.
It ain't not serene.

And though the blueberry looks a little purple,
And though your maple syrup looks a little murple,
Don't believe what you have heard or you have saw.
Oh the Danube isn't blue, it's green.

Oh, the Danube is green as the grass in the spring
It's as green as the dollar you spend on a fling.
It's as green as the paint that you put on the screen.
Oh the blue of the Danube is greener than green.

Many tears ago you called me darling in my dreams I hear you say it now
I can almost feel your arms around me arms that never meant to keep the vow
Many tears ago 'twas in the springtime when you said goodbye and went away
Oh how well this aching heart remembers many many tears ago today",Many Tears Ago

Remember me I'm the one who loves you
And when the world has turned you down and not a true friend can be found

I don't care where this old river carries me
I'll keep drifting just because my heart is broken inside
And I'm tired of wishing for what cannot be
I may meet some little driftwood lost as same as I
Share a handshake and a tender tear or two
But it's always good luck how we've got to say goodbye
I must wander on to keep my randezvous

Though I drift through town and city I can never stay
For I find no place to call my home sweet home
I don't ask for help or pitty I'll just go my way
All I'm praying for is peace to dream alone
I'm just driftwood on the river and I'm drifting on
Till this weary river meets the deep blue sea
Where the deep blue sea may help me to forget someone
Yes the careless one who has forgotten me
In my heart I don't feel bitter over what has been
I feel sorry for the one I must forget
And instead of being someone with the world to win
I'm just driftwood on the river of regret",Driftwood on the River

And it broke your heart in two to see him go
Now you know the lonely nights that I've gone through
And I'm glad that I can say I told you so
When you cry yourself to sleep remember me
Think of all the things I told you long ago
You know how it feels to be the used to be and I'm glad that I can say I told you so

So your someone broke your heart you realize
That the time has come to reap just what you sowed
For somebody else told you the same old lie and I'm glad that I can say I told you so

And the sadness of an achin' heart you know
I'll be happy with another in your place and I'm glad that I can say I told you so

With tavern lights shining in her hair

There's no fool like a young fool who throws her life away.

You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

Or you might have known I'd never make a wife

There 'neath the stars a maiden so fair divine.

Ray Price,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountainside
The summer's gone and all the flow'rs are dying
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide

But come ye back when summmer's in the meadow
And when the valley's hushed and white with snow
'Tis I'll be there in sunlight or in shadow
Oh, Danny boy, Oh Danny boy' I love you so

And if you come when all the flowers are dying
And I am dead, as dead I may well be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say and 'Ave' there for me

And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me
And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be
If you only tell me that you love me
Then I will sleep in peace until you come to me
(Repeat first two verses)",Danny Boy
Ray Price,"I walked one day neath the summer sky and my heart was young and alone was I
She came along and I fancied heard the beautiful music of Greensleeves
She held my hand happiness complete and we kissed that night as we vowed to meet
The promises that she made we sweet just as sweet as the music of Greensleeves

Ray Price,"Soft rain was falling when you told me goodbye
Thunder and lightning filled my heart inside
The love born in heaven had suddenly died
And the soft rain was teardrops for the angels all cried

If love can be perfect ours must have been
But perfection is always destroyed by men
The rain whispered softly a true love just died
And the soft rain was teardrops for the angels all cried

And I look across at smiling lips that warm my heart and see my morning sun

And if that's not loving me then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples and it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
There's no such thing as Doctor Suess
Disneyland and Mother Goose is no nursery rhyme

God didn't make little green apples and it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when myself is feeling low I think about her face aglow and ease my mind
Sometimes I call her up at home knowing she's busy
And ask if she could get away and meet me and grab a bite to eat

And she drops what she's doing and she hurries down to meet me and I'm always late
But she sits waiting patiently
And smiles when she first sees me cause she's made that way
And if that ain't loving me then all I've got to say

God didn't make little green apples

Ray Price,"Every night I go down to this same little joint
Fill up my glass till I reach the point past remembering
Where the music is loud the conversation is free
A dance or two with someone to keep me from remembering

The fool I've been the hurt I've caused the good woman that I loved and lost
For she's constantly with me in memory
I go home but I couldn't sleep and after hours I'd be walking the streets remembering
A good woman's love is hard to find and my woman's love was just that kind

And I'm the reason that she's gone today
I miss her so and the price that I pay is remembering
I take her to sleep in my dreams every night
Then start all over in the morning light remembering

The way it was when she loved me then like a fool how I carelessly
Broke her heart then watched my world fall apart
I'd give this world for yesterday just to have her love me the way I remember
Just to have her love me the way I remember
Just to have her love me the way I remember",Remembering
Ray Price,"If you think you've had enough if you think our life's been rough
Why not take your love line off of me and set me free

I'm still not over you I find that nothing's changed

Each night in dreams I see your face
Memories time can not erase
Then I awake and find you gone

So far away from lips so sweet and warm
Just out of reach of my two empty arms.

Ah honey, you know that old lonesome feeling that I have all the time

That a man without love is only half of a man but a woman is nothing at all
She knows I don't love her although heaven knows that I've tried
Her reason for living's to go right on giving no one thinks that's she's been denied

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl
And still their heavenly music floats, o'er all the weary world.
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its babel sounds the blessed angels sing

Oh yeah, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
Oh, rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their king

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk

Cause therels something in a sunday

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I lived with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone

It was there I found beside the Alamo

A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love

Call back my Rose Rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals fallin' apart
Speak once again of my love my own

To this big time lonesome town.

Half as cold as all the people I've found.
Every way I try to go here seems to bring me down.

I've got a mind to see the headlights shining
On that old white line between my heart and home.
Sick of spendin' Sundays wishing they were Mondays
Sittin' in a park alone.
So give my best to anyone who's left who ever done me
Any lovin' way but wrong.
Tell 'em that the pride of just the other side o nowhere's
Goin' home.

Takin' nothin' back to show there
For these dues I've paid.
But the soul I almost sold here
And the body I've been givin' away.
Fadin' from the neon nighttime glow here,
Headin' for the light of day,
Just the other side of nowhere, goin' home.

And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad so I had one more for desert
Then I fumbled through my closet for my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
Well I'd smoke my brain the night before with cigarettes and songs I'd been picking
But I lit my first and watched the small kid coursin' at a can that he was kicking
Then I crossed the empty street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken
And it took me back to something that I'd lost somehow somewhere along the way
On the Sunday morning sidewalk wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing (sure) short of dying half as lonesome as a sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk Sunday morning coming down
In the park I saw a daddy with the laughing little girl that he was swinging
And I stopped beside a Sunday school and listened to the song that they were singing
Then I headed back for home and somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyons like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

But if it's love that you're playing for bet it all
There's no way to save your pride
Or leave a cushion for yourself should you fall
If it's love that you're playing for play to win
A heart is only broken when it loses the desire to try again

But you could build a wall around you know no one would blame you
Those who gather round would not look down although they're seeing through
You could let the sorrow that you're feeling be tomorrow's point of view
Or you could let the feeling that you're hoping for be what's guiding you

And to me you'll always be just as sweet as flowers in May
And I'll still love you as I did in yesterday",My Life's Been a Pleasure
Ray Price,"I take a trip every evening 
Strolling down memory lane
I'm walkin' again those familiar paths 
Dreaming those dreams again
And I can always see my sweetheart 
Just as she used to be
Waiting for someone at the garden gate 
And I know that someone is me
Big brown eyes and pearly hair 
And you'd tell that's Mary
Rosy cheeks and ruby lips 
Can't you tell that's Mary?
Oft times in the evenings 
We'd go strolling
Hand in hand together 
Beneath the pepper tree
And I can feel her hand in mine 
As I sit alone tonight
Dreaming of the times I spent with Mary

Oft times in the evenings 
We'd go strolling
Hand in hand together 
Beneath the pepper tree
And I can feel her hand in mine 
As I sit alone tonight
Dreaming of the times I spent with Mary
Oh, gee, wouldn't it be wonderful
To open up the doors of the past
And live again as yesterday?
But you know no matter where I wander 
No matter where I roam
There'll always be a place in my heart, boys
For a girl away back, for a girl that 
I used to call Mary",My Mary
Ray Price,"Bright stars are watching the world as it sleeps
Shepherds watch over the little white sheep
The lighthouse is shining for ships out of sea
And God keeps the night watch for you and for me

So sleep, sleep in peace and rest
Don't be afraid of the darkness
All's well for over the land and the sea
God's keeping the night watch for you and for me

So sleep, sleep in peace and rest
Don't be afraid of the darkness
All's well for over the land and the sea
God's keeping the night watch for you and for me
God's keeping the night watch for you and for me

",Night Watch
Ray Price,"Some other world has all the sunshine 
'Cause there's no sunshine in mine
Out of the darkness came thunder and rain 
Leavin' my dreams all in vain
Some other world there sleeps my darlin' 
There, where the skies are always blue
Why don't they take me out of this world 
And let me find my sunshine with you?

Some other world there sleep",Some Other World
Ray Price,"Still water runs the deepest 
Like a love complete and through
So peaceful and dependable 
I can't say the same about you

Your love is cold and selfish 
And it never could be true
One time I loved you truly 
I can't say the same about you

I'm leaving, and I won't be back 
I'm goin' to where I belong
Too long we've been together 
And too long you've done me wrong

Still water runs the deepest 
Like a love complete and through
So peaceful and dependable 
I can't say the same about you

Well, I'm leaving, and I won't be back
Still water runs the deepest 
Like a love complete and through
So peaceful and dependable 
I can't say the same about you",Still Water Runs the Deepest
Ray Price,"Why me, Lord? What I have ever done to deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known?
Tell me, Lord, what did I ever do that was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown?
Lord, help me, Jesus; I've wasted it, so help me, Jesus; I know what I am
Now that I know that I've needed you, so help me, Jesus; my soul's in your hand

Try me, Lord, if you think there's a way I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe, Lord, I can show someone else what I've been through myself
On my way back to you
Lord, help me, Jesus
Jesus, my soul's in your hand",Why Me Lord
