David Kersh,"It's the same ol story all over the world
From bangkok to Birmingham, boy meets girl
He's a wild seed, got hell to raise
She's about to put him in his place

Boys will be boys, when girls will let them
It's a fact of life, don't you forget 'em
'cause the hand that rocks the cradle
Rules the world when you upset them
Boys will be boys, when girls will let them

Now you can hear him bragging, but he's just blowing smoke
Says he's the king of his castle but she knows it's a joke
He's a jester when his friends are around
She's the one who really wears the crown

Boys will be boys, when girls will let them
It's a fact of life, don't you forget 'em
'cause the hand that rocks the cradle
Rules the world when you upset them
Boys will be boys, when girls will let them

Well it's the same old story since time began
Love is a riddle men just can't understand
She says ""oh baby, you can do what you please""
One little look will bring him to his knees

Boys will be boys, when girls will let them
It's a fact of life, don't you forget 'em
'cause the hand that rocks the cradle
Rules the world when you upset them
Boys will be boys, when girls will let them
Boys will be boys
Boys will be boys
Makin some noise
Boys will be boys
Oh.... play it boys
Makin some noise
They got their toys...",Boys Will Be Boys
David Kersh,"She's a home-grown, natural-born girl-next-door
Never ever ever wanted anything any more
Than somebody who would love her
Just as much as she was gonna love him
Sweet little girl never had an evil thought
Till she caught him out being where he should've been not
In that minute it was ended and forever changed to never again

[Chorus]
Now she's breaking hearts and taking names
From now on she's making her own list of old flames
Look out boys it's a brand new game
Be on your guard, she's breaking hearts and taking names

She's outgrown the notion love's made to last
That Cinderella-syndrome's a thing of the past
If you're thinking that she's waiting for another prince charming - get real!
Just look at all the rookies lining up to take a shot
Got 'em slipping and a-tripping trying to show her what they got
Steppin' up to the plate not knowing that she's playing the field

[Chorus]

She's breaking hearts and taking names
From now on she's making her own list of old flames
Look out boys it's a brand new game
Be on your guard, she's breaking hearts and taking names
Be on your guard, she's breaking hearts and taking names",Breaking Hearts and Taking Names
David Kersh,"This old world's gone crazy, my life's livin' proof
Always runnin' around, no time to slow down
I don't know what I would do, if I didn't have you

Day in, day out and every night from dusk till dawn
This world spins round and girl, you keep me hangin' on
When the winds of doubt are blowin', your love keeps me goin'
Somehow, day in day out

I get so worn out and worried, keepin' up this pace
But you ease my mind every time, I get caught up in the race
You're my saving grace

Day in, day out and every night from dusk till dawn
This world spins round and girl, you keep me hangin' on
When the winds of doubt are blowin', your love keeps me goin'
Somehow, day in day out

Day in, day out and every night from dusk till dawn
This world spins round and girl, you keep me hangin' on
When the winds of doubt are blowin', your love keeps me goin'
Somehow, day in day out, day in day out
Day in day out, day in day out

David Kersh,"Your teacher might've told you it was five thousand something feet
That ain't to far in a car or on a city street
Let me tell you son, back where i come from
You learn as a little child
There ain't nothing any longer than a Louisiana country mile

Amos walker said he'd shoot me next time he caught me crossing his fence
But i was too much in love to really think about it back then
Walking that tree cross thibidioux creek
I can still see them gators smile
But she was worth every step of that Louisiana country mile

That path got shorter as i fell deeper
I'd swim that old swamp if i had to to see her
Those days are gone and she's a memory,
But when that road looks long it hits me
There's a treasure at the end of most of life's troubles and trials
And there ain't nothing longer than a Louisiana country mile

I've come a long way from that little house back in the woods
And i know i don't get back there as much as i should
But every now and then when the walls close in i can still smile
I close my eyes and let my mind walk that Louisiana country mile

That path got shorter as i fell deeper
I'd swim that old swamp if i had to to see her
Those days are gone and she's a memory,
But when that road looks long it hits me
There's a treasure at the end of most of life's troubles and trials
And there ain't nothing longer than a Louisiana country mile
Don't talk till you've walked that Louisiana country mile",Louisiana Country Mile
David Kersh,"(Roy Hurd)

Your eyes - shine like moonlight
Your lips - soft as rain
When we touch, it's fire at midnight
My heart calls out your name
I would walk the darkest highway
Just to know your secret charms
I have dreamed of kissing you softly
As you fall asleep in my arms

I could be there when you need me
Say the word and I'll make my stand
Take away all the fear I'm feeling
Till all that's left is the love of a man

You laugh and I'll laugh with you
When you cry, I'll share your tears
I believe in this love I can give you
The kind of love that could last through the years

I could be there when you need me
Say the word and I'll make my stand
Take away all the fear I'm feeling
Till all that's left is the love of a man

Oh, I could be there when you need me
Say the word and I'll make my stand
Take away all the fear I'm feeling
Till all that's left is the love of a man

David Kersh,"When I came to this morning she was packing up her things
Even with my pounding head I could hear her call me names
""you don't work, and drink and fish and dance and party-loving fool""
Rolled off her tongue and all I could say was ""baby think it through""

And give me one good reason why you want to leave me
You know I love you baby just calm down and take it easy
Lay down here beside me
No need for quick decisions
Before you throw all this away
Give me one good reason

She said ""you ain't brought a flower into this house in years
Your gift to me last valentine's was a case of your favorite beer.
Did I forget to mention I can't stand the sight of you?""
I said, ""don't sugar-coat it baby, you know I can take the truth""

Give me one good reason why you want to leave me
You know I love you baby just calm down and take it easy
Lay down here beside me
No need for quick decisions
Before you throw all this away
Give me one good reason

Give me one good reason why you want to leave me

David Kersh,"Wait till you're sure they're sound asleep
Then say a little prayer those stairs don't creak
Where the river runs deep and the wildflowers bloom
We'll do some things your daddy wouldn't want us to do
The water will be warm from the august sun
But the middle of the night is when it's most fun
We'll take a little dip in our birthday suits
And do some things your daddy wouldn't want us to do

Aww... if he only knew what was going on
Under that moon till the edge of dawn
He'd skin my hide, tan my tail
Run me out of town on a one-way rail
I'll take that chance for you
Let's do somethings your daddy wouldn't want us to do

Thinking of your kiss gives me a chill
A little bit of risk & a whole lot of thrill
At the bend in the river we're breaking some rules
Let's do some things your daddy wouldn't want us to do

Aww... if he only knew what was going on

David Kersh,"Until this moment, love was just a word in a song
And I stood there watching as the whole world danced along
Until this moment, I never dreamed that dreams came true
And prayers were answered
Oh but now I do

Until now I was lost and alone
Until you my heart had never known
Just what love was really all about
Until you, until here, until now

Life had no meaning, now when I hold you I'm amazed
How all the pieces fall right into place

Until now I was lost and alone
Until you my heart had never known
Just what love was really all about
Until you, until here, until now

David Kersh,"Everyday I rush right home,
Just like you were there waitin' on me,
To put the final touch on one more day.
There's always no answer when I call your name,
But I act as though nothing's changed;
It's easier for me to live this way.

As if I didn't know you left me,
I pretend you're right here in my arms.
I don't see what it hurts to still love you;
No, I don't see any harm.
So I go on as if I didn't know,
As if I didn't know.

Every night it's the same routine,
Off to sleep in search of a dream,
Where we're as happy as we ever were.
And I'll admit I've gotten good,
At makin 'em end the way the way they should;
That way I can deal with all this hurt.

As if I didn't know you left me,
I pretend you're right here in my arms.
I don't see what it hurts to still love you;
No, I don't see any harm.

David Kersh,"Well, I was born a-kickin, lord, and bound to die the same
Son of a son of a man on the run, reared on raisin cain
Mama put lead in my boots to keep me on the ground
But once I heard that highway call, couldn't nothing hold me down.

Cause I'm on a wild ride, full stride, I've let go of the reins
I get off on getting out of control
Baby, I've got a raging fire, running through my veins
I just can't seem to take it slow
Oh cause life gets better I know,
The faster I go

Well people call me crazy, why'all, just because I'm young
But I ain't gonna waste one night till my days are done
Full speed down the track, forget about the brakes
If you don't want to get on board, then you'd best get outta my way

Cause I'm on a wild ride, full stride, I've let go of the reins
I get off on getting out of control
Baby, I've got a raging fire, running through my veins
I just can't seem to take it slow
Oh cause life gets better I know,

David Kersh,"Hello walls
How'd things go for you today?
Don't you miss her since she up and walked away?
And I'll bet you dread to spend another lonely night with me
But lonely walls, I'll keep you company.

Hello window
Well, I see that you're still here
Aren't you lonely since our darlin' disappeared?
Well look here, is that a teardrop in the corner of your pane?
Now don't you try to tell me that it's rain.

She went away and left us all alone the way she planned.
Guess we'll have to learn to get along without her if we can.

Hello, ceiling. I'm gonna stare at you a while.
You know I can't sleep so won't you bear with me a while?
We must all pull together or else I'll lose my mind.
Cause I've gotta feelin she'll be gone a long, long time.

David Kersh,"Lately I've been running into our old friends
And somewhere in the small talk
Someone always asks where you've been
So I tell them what you told me
And they can't believe we're through
They ask me what I'm doin' now
And in case you're wondering too

I breathe in and breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Till you find
I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then
I'll breathe in and breathe out

I've got every reason to find someone new
Cause you swore up and down to me
I've seen the last of you
But the way you loved me
Left me hopin and holdin on
So until this world stops turning round
And my heart believes you're gone

I'll breathe in and breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Till you find
I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then
I'll breathe in and breathe out

We were meant to be, girl, there's no doubt
If it takes the rest of my life
For you to figure it out

I'll breathe in and breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Till you find
I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then
I'll breathe in
And breathe out","I Breathe In, I Breathe Out"
David Kersh,"If there was a perfect night
This might be the one
For telling you the way I feel
And just how real we've become
If I'm anxious and a little uptight
It's because I want to ask you this right

(Chorus)
If I never stop loving you
Will you never start wanting me too
Say you won't and that's what I'll do
For forever with a heart so true
If you'll start and end everyday
Always never wanting me to go away
All I'm ever gonna do
Is never stop loving you

Forgive me I'm a little bit nervous
I really rehearsed what to say
It's funny in front of the mirror
My words sounded clearer today
In my heart I've got it straight in my head
I mean everything I think I just said

(Repeat Chorus)

Even though it isn't what I had planned
I really think you understand",If I Never Stop Loving You
David Kersh,"There was no moon that night,
But the light in your eyes,
Pulled at my heart and turned the tide;
I was carried away.
Now all I do is pray,
That someday you'll stay right by my side.

But it's out of my hands;
I have no control
Of where love will lead us, on this winding road.
But if I had my way,
I'd be your man,
I'd give all I have and all I can.
So I'm letting go,
'Cause inside I know
It's out of my hands.

In the past I'd hold on,
Thinkin' I was so strong,
Only to find I was so wrong.
There ain't a thing I can do
To make you feel this way too,
But somehow my heart will carry on.

'Cause it's out of my hands;
I have no control
Of where love will lead us, on this winding road.
But if I had my way,
I'd be your man,
I'd give all I have and all I can.
So I'm letting go,
'Cause inside I know
It's out of my hands.

Maybe this mystery
Will never be clear to me.

It's out of my hands;
I have no control
Of where love will lead us, on this winding road.
But if I had my way,
I'd be your man,
I'd give all I have and all I can.
So I'm letting go,
'Cause inside I know
It's out of my hands.

So I'm letting go,
'Cause inside I know
It's out of my hands.",It's Out of My Hands
David Kersh,"I spent my life trying to avoid it
I always said it was wrong for me
A sign of weakness that's how I saw it
And weak was something I didn't want to be
It wasn't love I was running from
I was just afraid to need someone

Now it feels so good to feel
The need to trust somebody and open up my heart
The need to share my secrets down to the deepest part
I can give, I can take,
Now it's okay to say
That sometimes I feel weak
When you're the reason for the need

You had the strength to cry on my shoulder
You weren't ashamed to lean on me
The honesty kept drawing us closer
And I saw how easy reaching out could be
You showed me love's not about control
Holding on to you is how I let go

And it feels so good to feel
The need to trust somebody and open up my heart
The need to share my secrets down to the deepest part
I can give, I can take,

David Kersh,"Okay, I admit it,
I'm seeing someone,
And it's gotten beyond a movie or two.
Now you boys were present
When I swore off fallin' in love,
But that was never really meant as a hard, and fast, rule.

[Chorus]
I'm not sayin' I will.
I'm not sayin' I won't.
I'm just feelin' somethings that I usually don't.
I'm starting to see the attraction of settling down.
Now, I mighta been rash, talking take 'em or leave 'em,
That night down at buster's,
That bull about freedom.
She's sure something, something to think about.

She's tender-hearted, open and honest.
I can sit and talk with her all night.
She's so smart and charming,
Not to mention she possesses
Those qualities you superficial guys like.

[Chorus]

She's enough to make me reconsider
My views on vows, and rings, and such.
Mortgages and babysitters,
The consequences of falling in love.

Oh, she's something, something to think about.",Something to Think About

I've been dying to let you
Have this heart of mine.
Honey, I've got a lot to give you
But I'll be honest with you
It's gonna take time.

Never thought I'd find another
That I'd ever trust again.
But darlin, you keep makin it better
Just lettin me know forever
Is somewhere in your plans.

To step out on the ledge

She wonders what clothes to wear
She puts on her make up
And brushes her long blonde hair

""do I look alright?""
And I say ""yes, you look wonderful tonight""

We go to a party
And everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
Walking around with me
And then she asks me
""do you feel alright?""
And I say ""yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful
Because I see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize
How much I love you

It's time to go home now
And I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys
And she helps me to bed
And then I tell her

I say ""my darling, you were wonderful tonight""
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight",Wonderful Tonight

Lots of reasons, stare at the staring walls

Warm as I sit here, close to the fireside

Ghost believer,
Spook Madonna to her bed of shame.
The eyes of a child
Watch her leaving,
In the morning rain,
Sweet Domino burning up again.
Up from her basement
High on the pavement
Secret fantasies from dream domain
Heartaches and reveries
Gets what she wants from me
And a churchbell ring
Domino is burning up again
Helpless as a falling leaf

Autumn 'neath the shooting stars
Moon above her Convent trees
Embracing all these scars
Where can you hide
A lonely Angel
A flicker of curtain
As the street lights dim

To stand at last together
To stand at last alone
At the place that they call home
And to talk about whatever
To talk about whatever

Until time becomes undone
Unchiselled and unborn
Before the lines of light
Were written on the dawn

Called forth from memory
And from memory came song

And we became as one
A father and a son.

Sound became the form
From form the dream was borne
The dream became the dreamer
As real as anyone

There's no going that
The cul-de-sac one way warned you, babe
With a freight train there's no turning back

You wake to the serial nightmare
Your body's a heartbreakin' sight
A face forlorn in my windscreen
In the moonlight, so blue, so bright

Arcadie is this a portrait of you
Arcadie, you know I do
You know I do

Some hearts seem senselessly haunted
Others calmly defined
In slow mo' I'm watching you movin' beside him
What could you not leave behind

Who poisoned your dreams of a future?
Who hurt you then left you afraid?
Who blew away all your tomorrows like candles
Snuffed in The No Hope Arcade?

Some hearts are brutally blind, Arcadie
Others are achingly kind

Arcadie is this a portrait of you
Arcadie, you know I do
You know I do

But a smile, brings no note of redemption
The lover creeps home to the wife
Burnt out, a silhouette car wreck
Hot-wired in the highway of life

A colt shouldered ghost of innocent lost
Disbelief stares back at you
A long-legged looker, hooking for love
In headlamps so deadly and true

Arcadie is this a portrait of you
Arcadie, you know I do
You know I do

Napalmed with mini bar comforts
They got shipwrecking fem-fem eyes
Capsizing sights, abandoned, drowning
Safe in the warmth of his lies

No there's going this way
No going that
Her naked reflection going down on you
As the white screen fades to black

Oh Arcadie, I've painted this portrait for you
Indigo blue

David Knopfler,"So many songs about angels
It seems God makes 'em with his hands
So I guess this mess of falling angels
Must fit his immortal plans
How every flower should open
How every crippled bird should fly
And a cry of love from the deepest darkest oceans
Flies up through his brightest broken skies

I can't point no fingers
You can't do nothing more to me
See here's my broken hammer
(Can't play my A flat)
But I'm still playin' in that key

And in the holy saint's asylum
There's this patron for lost souls
Who've perjured grail for money
Mammon's kingdom and his power
All is painted glory
Oh yeah glory holds a key

But here's this broken hammer (can't fix this old piano)
Seems sometimes you can't get enough of me hurting
As the hammer hits the key

But if God could make them angels
With only mud and dust and sand
Making blood from living water
Man, I think I'd understand

He'd be in every flower that opens
He'd be the first new breath of spring
In the bird song high in the skies sailing clear across
the oceans
Some hear his voice in every bell that rings

They say it's God who made the angels
From infinity and sand
But if Heaven made the angels
Who in hell made man?
If God could make angels
If God could make angels
Why in hell make man?",If God Could Make the Angels

David Lahm,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Drinking them down when they're full
An eye on the sky for the angels
But I dig my heels in when they pull
Locking my doors and my windows 
And wishing that I could be free
Of the change in me

When all you feel is fear
When you wish someone would notice

I long to explain but I can't find the words
It's right there on the tip of my spirit

I swim through the street, I lean through the haze
I push through the current and tide
Straining to hear the soft voice in the wind
A memory, an omen or sign
I bow to the night at the end of the land
And the undertow pulls on my feet in the sand

You stand just past the edge of the light I can see
You speak and I struggle to hear it
I long to explain but I can't find the words
It's right there on the tip of my spirit

I wrestle and roll with these angels
We're gasping for breath through our tears
I struggle and spin
Awake again
And I find I'm the only one here

You stand just past the edge of the light I can see
You speak and I struggle to hear it
I long to explain but I can't find the words
It's right there on the tip of my spirit",Spirit
David LaMotte,"So they built their shiny hotel
Where the water meets the land
They smiled a little nervously 
As the ocean took the sand
They went down below the shoreline
And they hauled it back again
But the heavy rain and the hurricane
And the water's gonna win

The water's gonna win
Bring it all back
It will wash away again
The water's gonna win
Pack it up or pack it in
The water's gonna win

The glass of water you were sipping
As you watched the morning come
Has quenched the thirst of seven others
Underneath a younger sun
We are memories and moments
We are born and born again
Rushing stream and breathing steam 
The water's gonna win

The water's gonna win
Ascending and falling and rising up again
The water's gonna win
Ride the tide and ride the wind
The water's gonna win

Haul the rocks and sign the papers
Pour another glass of gin
Cut the ribbon with the scissors
But the water's gonna win

You went down beside the river
Just about a year ago
Gave the ashes to the current 
Saw them swirl into the flow
You still hold it all inside you
You can't stop once you begin
Close your eyes and feel it rising
The water's gonna win

The water's gonna win
You can't hold back the tide
You can't hide from what's within
The water's gonna win
Feel it move beneath your skin

The water's gonna win
It will with keep flowing through 
All we are and all we've been
The water's gonna win
Forever and amen
The water's gonna win",Water
David LaMotte,"I've got to be going now, though I'd rather stay
You know it is hard to leave, but I must be on my way
But before I leave you, friend, there's something that I have to say

You mean the world to me and I'll never stop loving you
'Cause what you have given me I can never repay
And if we meet again somehow, I will love you then as now
'Cause you mean the world to me

And when life is getting me down, as sometimes it will do,
My heart will come back to these mountains
And I'll remember you
I'll remember the love that we shared
And the ways that we grew

You mean the world to me and I'll never stop loving you
'Cause what you have given me I can never repay
And if we meet again somehow, I will love you then as now
'Cause you mean the world to me

Though I've got to go away, I won't leave you behind
Memories of times that we shared together
I'll carry in my mind
Some times were happy, some times were hard,
But I'm glad all those memories are mine

You mean the world to me and I'll never stop loving you
'Cause what you have given me I can never repay
And if we meet again somehow, I will love you then as now
'Cause you mean the world to me",Song for You

It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Nothing can come between us, 
When it gets dark I tow your heart away. 

Standing by a parking meter, 
When I caught a glimpse of Rita, 
Filling in a ticket in her little white book. 
In a cap she looked much older, 
And the bag across her shoulder 
Made her look a little like a military man.
 
Lovely Rita meter maid, 
May I inquire discreetly, 
When are you free to take some tea with me. 
Took her out and tried to win her, 
Had a laugh and over dinner, 
Told her I would really like to see her again

Got the bill and Rita paid it, 
Took her home I nearly made it, 
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.

On a lonesome highway it was gettin' late
Not another set of headlights on the interstate
I was miles from nowhere my only friend around
Was a country station fadin' in and out

And the road went on and on
But it just kept hangin' on
I can live with the static Lord but
I can't turn it off
It might not be clear and strong
And sometimes it's here and gone
Long as it keeps comin' back
I can't turn it off

I was feelin' kinda desperate as the sun came up
They played ""Hello Darlin'"" and it was breakin' up
The signal on that lighted dial was barely comin' through
And I knew in a few more miles it'd be gone for good

And the road went on and on
But it just kept hangin' on
I can live with the static Lord but
I can't turn it off
It might not be clear and strong
And sometimes it's here and gone
Long as it keeps comin' back
I can't turn it off

Be a long ol lonely ride without it
When I can't hear enough
Oh I just turn it up

And the road went on and on
But it just kept hangin' on
I can live with the static Lord but
I can't turn it off
It might not be clear and strong
And sometimes it's here and gone
Long as it keeps comin' back
I can't turn it off

David Lee Murphy,"Creole Williams lived down a dirt road
Made homemade wine like nobody I know
Dropped by one Friday night and said, ""Can you help me, Creole?
Got a little girl waitin' on me and I want to treat her right""

I got what you need son, it's sittin down in the cellar
He reached through the cobwebs as he turned on the light and said

There might be a little dust on the bottle
But don't let it fool ya about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
It's one of those things that gets sweeter with time

She was sittin' in the porch swing as I pulled up the driveway
My ole heart was racing as she climbed inside
She slid over real close and drove down to the lake road

After all these years, there's one thing I've found

Well there's a rusty ol tin roof overhead
Keeps out the rain at night
A lazy ol dog layin' under the truck
And he's been known to bite
There's a 12 gauge shotgun over the door
So darlin' don't be surprised
If we end up starin' down a double barrel
When we pull up the drive 'cause

Mama 'n them have always lived
Way back up in the hills
Nothin's ever changed 'em
Lord nothin' ever will
If they don't shoot us first they'll ask us in
And treat you just like long lost kin
Honey you're gonna fit right in
With mama 'n them

Better honk the horn just to let 'em know
They don't get much company
And they won't believe this big cadillac
Really belongs to me
If you ain't sure yet just what to expect
From my side of the family
Well you better duck to know it's us
I can't make no guarantees 'cause

Mama 'n them have always lived
Way back up in the hills
Nothin's ever changed 'em

And treat you just like long lost kin

David Lee Murphy,"I just dropped five dollars in a jukebox, baby
Ain't a soul on the ol' dance floor
If you're gonna run with the big dogs hon
You gotta get off the porch

You can sit there all night uptight, honey
But a good time's something I know
You gotta get the jump while the night is young
And there's just one way to go

Out with a bang kickin' up dust
Honey, tonight I'm all wound up
Over the fence and off of my chain
Honey, tonight I'm hurricane
Out with a bang

You know some folks say, ""I'll never see heaven
If I don't change the road I'm on""
But me I know just where I'm goin'
I don't have to be told

The say livin' fast just won't last
But that don't bother me
'Cause when it comes my time to go
I won't go easily

Out with a bang kickin' up dust
Honey, tonight I'm all wound up
Over the fence and off of my chain

Well they took me home in the back of a checker cab
After somebody took a chair cross the back of my head
My mama said bring him on in
And when they told her where I'd been she said
Why can't people just get along

Well mama never said a word as she patched my head
I figured she wasn't happy with me gettin' her out of bed
I said mama I hope you ain't mad
She said come on we're going back hey
Why can't people just get along

Why can't people just get along
What a world it would be
If we could all just have fun
'Cause it don't do nobody right
When it comes down to a fight hey
Why can't people just get along

Now when I got trouble ain't no one I'd rather have
Than my mama next to me with a broken bottle in her hand
She went in swingin' and when she got through
Everybody saw her point of view she said
Why can't people just get along

Why can't people just get along
What a world it would be
If we could all just have fun
'Cause it don't do nobody right
When it comes down to a fight hey

Well now things don't always run smooth in a honky tonk
And some nights somebody's gonna rub somebody wrong
And in those isolated incidents
We all loose our common sense hey

David Lee Murphy,"When the sun is dawnin', and he's just gettin' up
Starin' out over the mornin' through the steam off his coffee cup
He thinks about a woman whose love he still holds dear
A sweetheart he kept hangin' on for way too many years
It could've been so different with a family and a wife
But he was crossed between his feelings and that Oklahoma sky

[Chorus:]
Another time and in another place
He might have rode with Jesse James
And though he rides, he can't out run his fate
'Cause he was born 100 years too late

It's hard to imagine another world out there
As he lays beside a campfire up in only God knows where
But he feels the day approachin' when the kind of life he's known
Will only be in stories and sung about in songs

[Chorus]

And he wouldn't trade one sleepless night beneath the pourin' rain
If he had it all to do over again, he wouldn't change a thing

Came out swingin' and a kickin' with my heels dug in
Puttin' up a fight like they ain't seen since
The doctor held me up looked me in the face
Said he didn't have to slap me but he did it anyway

I don't know why
Just born that way
No I don't know why
Just born that way

No I never had nothin' and I know I never will
All my daddy left me was a funeral bill
If something's too easy something's wrong I know
'cause I was born the gift of a hard way to go

I don't know why
Just born that way
No I don't know why
Just born that way

You know all in all it ain't such a bad lot
You learn to live with what little you got
Never had a job that didn't stink
Never really cared what anybody thinks

Walked out a little too fast
I said some things that I didn't mean

Man when are you gonna learn
You told her goodbye you left with your pride
But you're gonna eat those words

Tryin' to swallow my pride

It's a thunderin' sound silver droppin' down
In an ol' pay phone
When you're makin' that call to say you were wrong
And it's ringin' like nobody's home

That I left and broke her heart
I'm prayin' she answer 'cause I gotta tell her

And I couldn't tell you what day it is baby
Not when your in my arms 'cause honey

To keep under control

No darlin' it even makes me proud

And got out in the rain
Changed a blown out tire on a car
For a family with out of state plates
I said dad did we know those folks
As they waved and drove out of sight
He just smiled as he started the car

Many years gone by
Had the hood of my truck pulled up
My ol' gas tank was dry

Pulled up to check on me
He said I been in your shoes before son

In her favorite old faded blue jeans
And one tail waggin' puppy climbed up into her arms

And I know this time
That my hands are tied
With those velvet lies
So soft and warm
Well I can't help thinking
It could always be like this
But I know the truth
Is somewhere waiting

And you know I can't resist
And those velvet lies
On your lips tonight
Would be so easy to believe in
And I know this time
That my hands are tied

Late nights and smokey ole pool rooms
Bars closin' down at three
And I'm right here in the middle of it all
With the bad company
Well maybe you don't understand it
Oh and we might never agree
But I'm past the point of making excuses
That's what I am and I guess the truth is

We can't all be angels
Naw naw naw
I can't say that
I claim to be much of a 
Saint after all
But I can tell you it ain't so bad
Once you've learned how to fall

Flyin' down these ole backroads
Is when I feel at my best
When I've twisted all the rules that'll bend
And broken all the rest
Now I'll never try to change you
Oh and I'd never do you no wrong

We can't all be angels
Naw naw naw
I can't say that
I claim to be much of a
Saint after all
But I can tell you it ain't so bad
Once you've learned how to fall

There's a lot to be said for good clean livin'
And if I have to sneak through the back door to heaven

We can't all be angels
Naw naw naw
I can't say that
I claim to be much of a
Saint after all
But I can tell you it ain't so bad
Once you've learned how to fall

David Lee Murphy,"Well she's just not the kind
To sit home on a Friday night
With big teardrops rollin' down her cheeks
Sittin' there all alone
Waitin' by the telephone
Prayin' it's gonna ring

Well she won't be beggin' for affection
She won't have to look too far for sympathy
No she won't be beggin' for affection
There's gonna be someone to give her all the love she needs

I can almost see it now
Hearts breakin' all over town
She was born for the world to appreciate
She deserves to be held and kissed
Like the woman she really is
If she decides to leave it'll be too late

Well she won't be beggin' for affection

But everybody says my brother looks like him
And my brother, he's in prison
And I doubt he?ll be gettin? out again

But I watch it from the cradle
Though mama tried to hide the truth from me
She did all that she was able
And Lord, I guess the rest is history

But we all know nobody?s perfect
And mama prayed I?d turn out differently
And she tried to raise me better

Oh well, I know she?d never say it
But we all make mistakes and that's a fact
And I know I'm not the first but I guess
I was Mama?s last

She had too much pride to take a helpin? hand
But she read the Bible
So I got no excuse for what I am

When they'd pass the plate on Sunday
I know it?d break her heart if she knew now
While she was puttin? in her quarters
I was reaching in and taking dollars out

That we're all lookin' for the same thing
And I'm tryin' to get there oh the best I can

Growin' up's been tough on me
I still don't know what I wanna be
I hope the good Lord understands

He got a hat full of sugar; folks said, ""You a lucky man.""
One night he just disappeared
And all we found was his hat in a clearing
Down by the Seven Eleven.
Folks cried, someone had died.
But I know Joe didn't go to heaven, no.

He went looking for trouble,
It was in his eyes.

And they were two of a kind.

Kinda quiet dude and sure was 'sposed to be back at the house
With the kids and the dog.
""And tonight we're rocketeers"", said Mouse.
""And I know a little joint upstairs in the back
Where we can sweat it all out and laugh.""
And without a doubt they were out

Looking for trouble,
The real kind.
She was a dime a dozen
And they were two of a kind.

""Hey, I feel like a yo-yo, I've been here too long.""
I bet if you asked them our heroes would say,
""Hey, we're already gone.""

""Put the stone behind"", he said
Then the words can blow better, better
I don't mind some stormy wheather
Tonight, no
I can feel it, the

[Pre-Chorus]

Put the top down, hit the road
I sing the only song we know
It's 2 a.m. the traffic's slow
It looks like ladie's night in Buffalo
Oh, baby

I got kinda sense of deja vu
I could swear I've seen you somewhere before
You don't think you've ever seen me somewhere before, do you, huh?
So it must have been two other people
I know, baby, I say, I didn't want to half drag you
It's too far to drive back, baby
I don't want to drive alone tonight

[Chorus]

Well it ain't much all right I know
But it's the only song I know
2 a.m. and the traffic's slow

David Lee Roth,"What? 
Well, let me roll up on to the sidewalk and take a look
Yes, whoa! She's beautiful
I'm talking about a Yankee Rose
And she looks wild, wild, wild, wild! 

Are you ready for the new sensation
Well here's a shot heard 'round the world
All you back room boys salute
When her flag unfurls
Well guess who's back in circulation
Now I don't know what you may have heard
But what I need right now's
The original good time girl 

She's a vision from coast to coast (coast to coast)
Sea to shining sea (sea to shining sea)
Hey, sister you're the perfect host
(Make a toast)
Show me your bright lights
And your city lights, all right
I'm talking 'bout the Yankee Rose
Bright lights
And your city lights, all right
I'm talking 'bout it 

When she walks
Watch, the sparks will fly
Fire cracking on the Fourth of July
No sad songs tonight
Something's in the air
Yeah, the feeling gets you
A real state of independence
So pretty when her rockets flare
Still proving every night
That her flag's still there 

She's a vision from coast to coast (coast to coast)
Sea to shining sea (sea to shining sea)
Hey, sister you're the perfect host
(Make a toast)
Show me your bright lights
And your city lights, all right
I'm talking 'bout the Yankee Rose
(Your) bright lights
And your city lights, all right
I'm in love with a Yankee Rose

Oh she's beautiful, all right
Nothing like her in the whole world
Yeah she's right on time
I'm on the case
Pick up the phone
No time to waste
She's got the beat
And there's a little bit
Coming your way 

Oh raise 'em up there
Let's see who salutes baby
Little bit, little bit, little bit higher
Here's the national anthem
A wanna get a little bit of apple pie, man

David Lee Roth,"Talk about meanwhile back at the ranch. 
The ugly ducklings learn to dance. 
Spirits rising, might be more. 
Gonna blow this whole town out the back door. 
Give 'em hell tonight. 
Go west young man?
All right. 
We'll burn the bridges if we please.
Or forever you can hold my peace.

A little taste I can't stop, tastes as sweet as soda pop. 
All dressed up and ready for the top.

[Chorus]
Yes I, got to have it, got to have it, got to have it and that's my bottom line.
Got ta have it, got to have it, got to have it,
have it one more time. Got to have it, got to have it, got to have it and that's my bottom line.
Got to have it, got to have it, got to have it baby.

You want to feel 100 proof? 
I got news for you. 
I seen some folks fall and a couple fly. 
And some of them just die.

Might get lucky, never mind.

David Lee Roth,"Time rools on
N' that's as it should be
Here and gone
Seems to move so quickly

Man, we was happy
In our restless hearts
It was heaven Right here on earth
Yeah, we were laughin'
As we reached for the stars
And we had some
For what it was worth

Those were good times
Damn good times
Those were good times
Damn good times

Hey, take a look at this picture,
Can you believe that was you?
And who's that standin' there in the corner?
Not me!
Ah, the crazy things we used to do
Sure, we was acting like a couple of kids
Good to remember
You know that it is
I still feel it
Like the sun on my skin
Maybe that's better

Cause these are good times
Damn good times
Talkin' about good times
Damn good times

So it's one for the money
But that don't make the show
Count to three and I'll be ready
To follow that road (yes I will)

I see it comin'
Yeah, and this one is outs
We got heaven right here on Earth
Ain't nothin' like it
When you're reachin' for stars
And you grab one
For what it is worth

You can tell 'em
We'll be having good times
Damn good times
I'm talkin' good times (yes sir)

David Lee Roth,"Those eyes burn holes
Into the starry night
And when her sleepy eyes
Are open wide
You can fairly dance beneath her light
And I'd love to get to know the natives
But I'm only flesh and blood
She'll share your joys
But not your sorrows
Mistress of the coming flood.

Hina
Cool upon the silent sea
Isn't she the moon queen

Hina
Whispering, In my dreams
You must come back to me

And the tides rise and a distant sigh
Falls on deaf ears
Her vision makes you every inch a king
King for a million years
And she loves you when you're leavin'
And she'll leave you if you stay
She says
""Don't tell me that you love me
You'll hate me for hearing it
When I drift away.""

Hina
I can hear you softly cry
Your storms and lullabies

Hina
I'll whisper in your dreams
Till you come back to me.

Come back
But she will never stay
Come back
And you must never wait,
Never wait. Never wait. Never wait.",Hina

And I know it too

But now her mama's got the eyes
Like she's workin' on a heart attack

With the ""when ya comin' back?""

Girl, stop complaining

Well, I tried to send a message
Yes, I tried the telephone

It comes from a jealous clock
And you're a permanent stranger

Is held for further questioning
When nothing's left but death and taxes

Protected the turf without obstructing the view

From the worst teacher goin'

That school's too slow
An' I know folks
Smart ones from the city
Who gone and made a life's work
And a decade later
they still do it shitty
Experience

That's experience for ya
Moves kinda slow
You get off the bus
The same guy that got on 20 years ago
And as I feel it
Is it art or imitating?
'Cause if it's art
Then all my life's been finger painting
Had my best luck, though

With a big easel
I'd rather be an art project, babe
Than just weasel out with wearin' one
And come to suspect the whole experience
Experience, I think I understand
Is it like doin' 90
Her top's down
An' wind's in your beer can
That single moment on a bungee jump
You're down goin' down
You're comin' up now

I think I felt that before
It was kind of an experience
One shining moment lost in time
The one with the showroom shine
Well, I'm sorry girl
Yes, I'm sorry boy
But I feel that way all the time
Till I finally made it
Life was kinda hit or miss
But after I made it

Life was ""Take a hit of this""
And I'd love to talk philosophy
But I've gotta take a piss
Man, that philosophy runs right through ya
Take it from me baby
I've got experience
All right

Is it like doin' a hundred

David Lee Roth,"I'm laying naked with ya
After making love
I caught a cold
I barely made it home
You said you loved me only
I felt no pain
And then I crashed my rent-a-car in the pouring rain

Seen it on a billboard
And I believe it's so
It said, ""The only thing you know for certain
Is 'Hey, you never know'""
My friend Jerry's feet are achin'
Says he's hittin' bottom
Says it's a sex problem
He told me so

I told him
""Jerry ain't the lovin' that you're makin' buddy
It's layin' out all night
And lookin' for it that makes you slow
Want some advice
And it's free for a reason you know
They say you only live twice
I said, ""Hey, you never know"" And the hula girls go...(ahhh)
You never, I said you never, never,
You Never Know

I'll make suggestions honey
You make the choices
Your Kodak moment's comin'
I'll keep the motor runnin'
I stand corrected baby
I'm hearin' voices honey
You got my engines hummin'
And now I'm really runnin'
Right up your driveway
Playin' hide in your hole
I'm on cruise control

Here's a word about my ex-girlfriend
Towards the end conflict off and on
And I told her one night, ""Honey every time we fight
I'll write a verse to this song""
Well, things got bad and things got worse
Still I struggled on
So sit back and get all comfortable
'Cause this little tunes six fuckin' hours long
And every journey's got destinations
Which the traveler can't expect
So how's that I'm always winding up
Down here at land's edge?

Now if love is blind why did her stockings
Always look so cool?
Now I know I was paying attention
But somehow I got fooled
Well I gave her seven children
And a twelve room uptown shack
And when it all was over
Took a dozen lawyers
To get half back
But I already got me a new gal to ruin my life
And she might just yet,
So I'm helping her find an apartment
Down here at land's edge

Now take the traveler and the tourist
The essential difference is
The traveler don't know where he's goin'
And the tourist don't know where he is
Small world till they lose your luggage, tho'
Take the stripper who lives next door
You'd swear this kid was 21 goin' on 44
But luckily that ain't how she sees it
Got a new tattoo that says:
""when I die, send the body to heaven,
Lost the rest at land's edge""",Land's Edge

My baby ran off with my best friend
But when I heard, I took it easy
Cause I knew I'd see those girls again

And livin' in harmony
So when I go to the movies
I pay for three
Angels gotta smile every once in a while
So why not on me?

Great ones for living under
First, don't sweat that little shit
Second is, there ain't no other
Tattoos, scars, and missing parts
And all the rich have ever proven
Is they are to life
What American Bandstand is to the theory of evolution

Who needs the aggravation
Least now I know it's no big ting

Now they're Polaroids and drinkin' stories
And I've got some good ones

Who'd ya do

When you're surfin' 40 footers

Too much exasperation

David Lee Roth,"I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I'd loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time all the time",Just a Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody

She got the stereo

Gonna go for broke tonight
And that's all night

Here, making each day of the year

Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow

When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow

Put their slippers on

David Leshare Watson,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

David Leshare Watson,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

I concentrate on you.

When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,

And don't look back, baby. 
Don't look back

The places behind you let them re-remind you
If your first lover broke your heart,
There's something that can be done.
You don't run it, you don't hide it, you don't run it
Don't end your faith in love because of what he's done.
So if you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
Keep on walking and don't look back.
Forget about the past now.
Don't look back, baby.
Keep on walking and don't look back
The places behind you let them re-remind you.

Love can be a beautiful thing.
Though your first love let you down.
'Cause I know we can make love bloom, baby.
The second time around.
So if you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
Keep on pushing and don't look back.
Now, till I say, we won't look back, girl.
Keep on walking and won't look back.
Forget about the past now, baby.
And don't look back.

David Lynch,"Bearing all the aforementioned dialogues we discover the possibilities of
The curve towards progressive behavior and the ultimate realization of the
Goal of evolution, which grants the benefits of added awareness with
Unlimited boundness of happiness, also known as bliss, which is a result of
The laws which govern physical behavior merging with the highest levels of
Spirit, and together manifesting the magical and mystical level of cosmic
Awareness, becoming one with the longing for complete surrender to the
Higher self, which has potentially been waiting these long eons of time, 
And in fact sometimes has been dipping into a state of semi-sleep or
Unconsciousness, bordering on complete absence of thought.

Specifically, the areas concerning the new futuristic thinking have to do
With several abstract, somewhat hidden, emotional tendencies which lead one
To believe that the consequences of interaction between the positive and
Negative forces are producing a vital link between the subconscious and
Super conscious minds, which therefore can only be considered as actual
Structures with two separate and distinctly different qualities. 

As we have seen, when one or more intensely feeling energies become
Associated with the higher levels of perceptible phenomenon, and these new
Forms are then instantly acted upon by the two minds previously discussed, 
And brand new associations are given over with resulting problems sorting
Out the new strains of emotional and physical qualities we see cropping up
In schools and places of business across the country, and in the cities
Which of course have the added complications of the much-argued-over
Proposition that one cannot tolerate the existence of two or more intensely
Opposing ideas at one point in time.

Others may find it easier to say ""however,"" and that thought alone is one
Which troubles many of us here who have for so long held the light up on
The words which brought meaning to us concerning the amount of effort it
Takes to ignite a certain process leading one to the knowledge of the truce
Behind the alternating essence which is unending without actually
Beginning, and in those words of course is the key to beginning a long
Journey toward understanding which, as we have learned, is something for
Which each human being cries out, cupping his hands over the mouth.

Sometimes in the evenings a feeling of the type which haunts young children
In the forest will come in on a dark wind, and all the light will fade
Leaving a low sound penetrating the eyes, which follow the dark shapes
Running for safe nests just out of reach of small white teeth and noses
Filled with dirt going up over the mountains covered with tall trees and
Green needles and red bark with pitch oozing out into the air, which dries
It on the surface causing it to become crusty which allows for the
Protection of all that lies within the crust, for it will now remain liquid
And hold itself remaining in a state close to that of the pure essence
Which will remind us of home, which will remind us of the red cookie-jar, 
And the smiles dancing around in the golden afternoons, while the pipe
Puffs out small clouds of smoke from the mouth of the father with an axe to
Cut wood growing on the tall mountains.

In order to assure that the fundamental qualities inherent in the solutions
To modern philosophical questions are accurate, the first and foremost
Consideration lies in the field of abstractions associated with the loss of
Nature, and with them the interaction of the primary forces of life itself
Which have now been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt to have their basis
In the field of the absolute in the vacuum state bringing to mind that
There has been a reversal of sorts of the age-old phrase, ""You can't get
Something from nothing."" As we have seen this kind of thinking which has
Been going on since the beginning of time is just a smoke-screen necessary
To block almost all truthful inquiries for centuries following, and it is
With this also on our minds that we see that the initial thinking on a
Subject is critical to all that follows, and can be an excellent partner to
The dark and evil forces which would have us living forever in darkness and
Confusion, refusing even to acknowledge that we even existed, or that there
Was such a thing as a bad tooth, or a tooth-ache.

Bringing our discussion to the realm of practical considerations, it is
Interesting to note the possibilities of dental hygiene and the remarkable
Idea of a world free of tooth-decay and all other problems associated with
The teeth, tongue, or oral cavity, which would, in fact, become a prime
Motivator for a certain disappearance of fears associated with pain
Connected with dental applications, and even the idea that plaque could
Appear upon the surface of the teeth, and the negative occurrences which
Follow such as the hideous odors emitted from the oral cavity and the
Discolorations and the resulted perforation of the once beautiful mental
Images, and the possibility of the breaking of relationships based upon the
Idea of negative distortion of the mouth, for teeth, while not necessarily
Considered one of the primary building blocks of happiness, can in fact
Become a small sore, festering and transferring negative energies to the
Once quiet and peaceful mind, giving it over to strange and unproductive
Thinking.

David M. Bailey,"Back behind the stage where the spotlight never shines, someone asked what faith means to me. I don't remember what I said - something ‘bout the spirit being free. Two more nights and a thousand miles later, his question was still inside my head. If I could just go back in time for a while, here's what I might have said instead: If you can believe in something bigger than your soul, even if it's something that you cannot see. If you can find a way to hold on to each heartbeat, even when it's beating quietly. If you can find courage in the strangest places, if you can find peace in the middle of a war. If you can walk but a portion of this journey, then you've found faith, faith and so much more. Everywhere I go there's always someone asking questions - questions without answers, but they ask them anyway. Usually I just tell them whatever comes to mind, reminding them they must find their own way. But the next time someone asks about this funny thing called faith, I'll have a thing or two to say. I suppose that by tomorrow, the words could be different, but here's what I'd say to them today: If you can find music in the middle of your midnight - after the last song has been played. If you can feel the bright sun on your shoulders, even when you're sitting in the shade. If you can touch the tender side of timeless, when it's something you've never felt before. If you can taste the fruit before it blossoms, then you've found faith - faith and so much more. ",So Much More

David M. Bailey,"They met for coffee every morning in the subway
Had a smoke before the 8:13 arrived
He was always just a bit hung-over
She said it was a wonder he was still alive
He always said that life is learning to walk fences
She'd say it was more like walking through a maze
He'd reply that every turn had consequences
She'd say ""I know, I've tried at least 1000 ways.""

They used to laugh about they way they talked in circles
And wonder about the bridges they had burned
He said freedom had always been his first love
She said freedom's in the lessons you have learned

He said ""I don't know why people call me reckless
She said ""because you never look before you leap
He said ""but jumping off a fence is not so dangerous
It depends on the company you keep

She said 'is that your way of saying that you trust me
Or that you tired of living all alone
Who is there to hold you when you get lost?
Who is there to welcome you back home?

His silence was thicker than the coffee, 
Then he whispered 'you're the only one who cares
She smiled and said 'is that an invitation?' 
Cuz somehow it feels more like a dare

He said ""no, I'm pretty sure that was a question""
I know I've made mistakes along the way
But you made me to believe in 2nd chances
So I'm taking my biggest chance today

Her silence lasted longer than the summer 
as she stared past him into the morning crowd
He said don't worry bout giving me an answer
but she cut him off and wondered right out loud

She said everyone I know thinks I am cautious
He said everyone you know is probably right
She said But you made me believe in taking chances
I never thought I could but I just might...

He said we'd never have to stop this conversation
If we hurry we could take the 9:05
She said i guess my maps won't do me any good now'
This must be what it's like to feel alive. ",Letting Go
David M. Bailey,"Don't let the grass grow beneath your busy feet Don't let the grass grow above you when you rest You've got one more day to get to where you're going One more day to give your very best

a hazy winter moon
a child's prayer at bedtime

like actors in a timeless magic show
Wonder what the stars do in the daytime
Some things I guess we'll never know.

Icy Rain talks to the windows
On center stage the sun begins to shine
Right on cue, Dawn begins to smile
dewdrops changing into wine

Each one walks a different road
Wonder when the silence gets a chance to sleep

David M. Bailey,"It's been 20 years since I've been on this playground 
This place has seen a lot of change
The monkey bars and swings, the sandbox and the rings
Seems like everything's been rearranged

The merry -go-round is in the middle
The seesaw was moved to the side
The grass where we looked for 4-leaf clovers
Has been covered by a giant plastic slide

So I'm sitting on this bench just reminiscing
About the years when all I had to do was play
When I could make a moment last forever
And I could fit forever in a day

Since then, a lot of things have happened
I've been around the world a couple times
I've watched us go to war, not always known what for 
I've seen us all commit every kind of crime

So I wonder if I've turned into a cynic
If growing up means giving up your joy
Just for a moment, I let myself imagine 
That once again, I'm just a little boy

Cuz then I'd prob'ly go right to the sandbox
And ask if they had space for just one more
Then play hide and seek along the banks of the creek
Buy baseball cards at the general store
But instead I to the old pavilion
Where the parents sit with a watchful eye
Everything looks different from their viewpoint 
I get confused when I feel like I could cry

Maybe this place hasn't really changed at all
It's still whatever children make it be 
There's a little dark-hired boy teasing all the girls
And I swear he looks a lot like me

As I watch the sweet commotion, I feel a strange emotion
I catch a glimpse of truth that looks so strange
It's my turn to go through what everybody goes through 
And realize that I'm the on who's changed.

I check my watch and can't believe the time
The afternoon is coming to a close
I sit down on a swing; throw my head back in the air
And celebrate what my heart now knows.

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

As the sun shines, oh, so holy,
On the good and gracious green.
In the summer of my dreams. 

By the banks of this old stream,
In the summer of my dreams.
By the deep pool, where the fish wait,
For the old fool, with the wrong bait.
There's a field of purple clover;
There's a small cloud passing over.
And the rain comes washing clean,
On the summer of my dreams. 

See the raindrops on the grass now,
Just like diamonds lying there.
By the old road where I pass now,
There's a twilight in the air. 

And as the sun sets down before me,
I see my true love waiting for me,
Standing by the back porch screen,
In the summer of my dreams.

In love before
What a difference a true love made in my life
So nice, so right

Would mean, so much

I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago

Of paradise, where roses grew

And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill like I had never known
You smiled, when you smiled at me that was how the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
I found my love at last",At Last

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland

I keep your picture beside my bed
And I still remember everything you said
I always thought our love was so right
I guess I was wrong
I always thought you'd be by my side, mam
Now you're gone

What I want to know baby, what we had was good
How come you don't call me
Anymore, yeah?

Listen
I still light the fire on a rainy night
I still like it better when you holding me tight (holding me tight)
Well, now, um
Everybody said, everybody said that we should never part
Oh yeah
I always did think we looked kind of cute together myself
Tell me baby, baby, baby, why, why you want to go and break my heart?
Why did you want to do it?

All I want to know baby, what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore?
Why don't you call me girl, yeah, yeah?

Ah, yeah, sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me, mama, girl, you gotta try
Down on my knees begging you please, please

Why can't you call me sometime baby, yeah

Just one lousy dime, baby
Why can't you call me sometime?
Oh, no, no
Why on earth can't you just pick up the phone, yeah?

I came back with the double D clan
Waitin for da man Buckshot, 
Da BDI...general, if I was you I wouldn't try
So many tried so I seen the petty pass by
Listen as I take you on a mission with precision
Like a brown cent went on a hunt
Worldwide searchin for the true ingredients 
To make the pi ?? 6
Shorty want to hound me for a flick
But I got my chips, you gettin visions of my lips
Dicks swang, it don't mean a thang 
'cause when I was down, you was on the other side of town
Getting done by Starang, when he was in range
Now its gettin cold, so you actin kinda strange
Puttin my time to you broke bitches
Don't do shit but stress me out, now I'm back in my riches
To get my blue print down to my very last dot
Every move every motivation that I need
Ain't no hesitation when it comes to rockin when we speak
Just follow my lead on this jou-rney

You never heard another MC like me
Follow my lead on the jour-ney
You never heard another MC like me

Follow my lead on the journey
You never heard another Mc like me
So poetically on point its ridiculous
Hittin every key bassline when I'm rippin this
Don't act like this ain't the shit right now
You know my hits make you want to dance
But you still sittin down
Dumb fucks have a seat and keep your tongue in your throat
And don't bother to quote one note
Or in the mirror you kickin the verse to mine
'cause in the freestyle, you'll be the last to rhyme
This ain't the battle between the two best no more
Survival of the fittest...this shit is war
If you got your eyes open, you can see the light
If you need a guide, follow wit pride...right

So many people took my lyrics and hooks
If I wrote a book about you crook niggas gettin shook
In a hot second, I'm a get the hot-steppin
On first, when I'm on my verse, niggas need a nurse
Without the kill patient, ain't no hesitation 
Bring your weapon like your military mind 
And steppin on E, times over for you Mc's
All hail to G-O-D's, G-O-D's....

And the world in your patient eyes
It will wait til we have arrived
I'm so alive
And I breathe you in

I'm breathing in your touch so reckless
I'm breathing in the words that slip softly from your fingertips

And a mantra you stole from a song
And though you feel you're exiled like a red headed child

A fragile religion of truth in disguise
You're a gift more than good in a season renewed

David Mead,"So a man and a woman forked at a baby
The prince of dysfunction boy on a string
From a suburban palace he walked out to freedom
Enslaved to a concept in the world of a king

And baby´s love he´s smoking in a peacoat
A ship on the ocean bird on a wind
With a poem and soul written in his honor
There´s a concrete assumption in the world of a king

A guitar and a girlfriend, just off the turnpike
Yeah, the fountain of ego learned how to sing
But the truth shall engage him with heartbreak and cold cots
In an unguarded moment in the world of a king

And baby´s gone, she´s dancing on a big stage
With a tear and a tutu
The phone never rings
And he can´t go on, he´s banging on a keyboard
There´s an E-mail to Jesus from the world of a king

Conversation by the candlelight was free

Never happy with nobody else but me

Baby what's become of us
A latent memory of Southern springs and summers
Maybe winter in New York

I'll take an airplane and leave the worst unmentioned
Blame it on a lack of time

I swept you off your feet
But now the dancing days are gone
You sleep alone, leave the radio on

I'm high above it now, the clouds a pillow for me
I consider even more
You have the softest eyes, the ways to wash and comfort
All the kids on Jersey shore

And I believe in easy answers
Coming home for Christmas
Minding manners all along

But only chances make a song
We sleep alone, leave the radio on

The natural defense
I lay there beside her
And came to my sense
Well heaven was healthy
But leaving was hell
The women beside me would know

So she took the lead
As I skipped off behind
Into a forest of ladies divine
A sweet piece of ass and
A hat for my head
Whatever made sense at the time

And I was asleep
When the lord showed his worth
I jumped down the well
Where the water was heard
If all fallen angels must climb back to earth
Send down a bucket of girls

Diving for pearls, I ran out of air
Swam through the world of bosoms and hair
Pristine she was, but weren't they all
Mercy, what god gave a girl

What's there to fear in the curl of a lip
The lamp lights the shoulder
And spills down the hip
South of Virginia the toes painted red
The glory of flowers in bloom

Going back to Nashville, laughing at a bad break
What's the use in wondering why
Maybe I'm a storm front rolling through the valley
Tearing up a good July

And it's safe and warm where nothing ever happens
Would it be so hard to realign a star or two
Change a southern night for you

Well it's not quite evening, and it's not New York
There's a scar in the blue sky by the old airport
And I'm talking crazy on the driver's side
I will always love you like a long goodbye",Nashville
David Mead,"Soon I'm gonna leave this place for good
The city lies as the city should
Yeah, you know there's just
One place to be
New Mexico wait for me

And oh, I wanna go
Where the air is clean
And oh, New Mexico wait for me

When I was a boy I would dream at night
A cowboy's dream by a cowboy light
Even though I haven't got to ride in yet
New Mexico won't forget

And oh, I wanna go
Where the air is clean
And oh, New Mexico wait for me

And I'm gonna take a ride
Through the mountains gallow
Stare into the great array
Maybe take a bath in the San Francisco
This is where I'll stay

Oh, I wanna go where the air is clean
Oh, New Mexico wait for me
New Mexico wait for me",New Mexico
David Mead,"Said goodbye to my family
Then I poured me a drink
Made my way to the city
Threw out the kitchen sink

Kept the words of my mother
To her favorite son
When the world's on your shoulder
You do the oneplusone

Oneplusone
You gotta go find someone
All alone in your bed and the day isn't done
Oneplusone
You gotta go find someone
All alone in your bed and the day isn't done

Say goodbye to your daddy
While I wait in the car
Watch him color with envy
To see you come so far

And maybe when you get older
You'll find reason to run
But you'll never get nowhere
Without the oneplusone

David Mead,"What in the world
Could be happening to me
I'm waltzing through graveyards
And surfing TV
For a face that resembles
A picture of yours
Three thousand miles
And memory that's blurred
Once again

It's a lonely ol', lonely ol' world
And you're only, you're only a girl

So bring on the music, the rhythm of cars
Day breaks in Soho and covers the stars
With a blanket for lovers,
The stuff in my head
Closed eyes discover I'm walking home
Holding your hand

It's a lonely ol', lonely ol' world
And you're only, you're only a girl

I'm framing your picture
And walking your dog
First of December, stumbling along
Like a drunk in the vineyard,
A whore on the street
Tongue-tied, immortal and
Light on my feet once again

It's a lonely ol', lonely ol' world
And you're only, you're only a girl
Such a beautiful mystery
The gravity pulling a boy to 
The ends of his earth
It's a lonely ol', lonely ol' world
And you're only, you're only a girl",Only a Girl
David Mead,"How did we ever end up here
Stuck in my old hometown
Shuffling our cards at the breakfast table,
Watching the world go 'round
Well baby you look like a princess
Wrapped in my old bathrobe
Torn from a page in a paperback still waiting to unfold
And it's true I've been waiting on an angel in disguise
So could you save me from an ordinary life

Where you can't be a kid in a candy store
Smacking your lips 'cause you still want more
I tried to be good but I'm still so bored tonight
And I just don't care for ordinary life

How do we get back to Kingston
Paris and Tokyo Bay
I've got a card with a number on it itching to pay your way
And it's true we can't quite afford the sparkle in my eye
But would you trade it for an ordinary life

Where you can't be the chick I was cruising for
Shaking your hips on a big dance floor
You tried to be good but you're still so bored tonight
'Cause you just don't care for ordinary life
And it's true I've been waiting on an angel in disguise

David Mead,"Well midnight has faded to morning
The city can't keep you with me
'Cause this is an island of vagabonds
A stop on the way to be free

But this is the wrong time for metaphors
You like my one-liners best
So take the Queensboro Bridge to the airport
I'll stay and settle for less

Well sweet baby Jesus is watching you
From his bed at the big corner church
And he knows the highs that you took me to
'Cause he knows the way that it hurts

But this is the wrong time for saying prayers
A kiss at the taxi will do
And if the Queensboro Bridge never gets you there
I'll be here waiting for you

You're a beautiful sight over east river lights
And I'm losing you
You're a dream taking flight in a pink morning sky
Yeah you're coming true

And this is the wrong time for saying prayers
A kiss at the taxi will do
But if the Queensboro Bridge never gets you there

Stumbling out the front door
Crashing 'round the corner
Maybe gone for good

And you might see him
Sitting in a dark room
Like he never knew you
And never wanted to

He might be walking on water
He might be floating through air
But through the darkest reminders
He will be hoping you're there

You might hear him
Begging for forgiveness
Dishing out some nonsense
That only brings you down

And you might hear him
Singing like his mother
A distant little number
That barely makes a sound

He might be walking on water
He might be floating through air
But through the darkest reminders
He will be hoping you're there

And you might see him
Creeping in your bedroom
Trying not to wake you
In the middle of July

Pulling back the covers
Hoping that you're still there
And hanging on for life",You Might See Him

I wonder if you're thinking of me, too
There's only so long, time can keep up apart
So until we meet, keep me in your heart
Keep wishing upon that same ol' star
And know that I love you, wherever you are

Can't say I know what you look like 
But you're in my heart, you're on my mind
And I feel your love deep down in my soul
When I finally find you, I'll just know

David Meece,"There's a father in your sweetest dreams
Who's always there to meet your needs
He never ever let you down

There's a mother in your heart of hearts
Who always plays the perfect part
She never lets you hit the ground

This is the need of children
These are their tender dreams
And oh, how it hurts when they don't come true

That's why I'm learning to trust in You
In everything I do
I'm learning to trust in You

'Cause I know in my heart that You're true
I'm learning to trust in You
But sometimes it's so hard to do

Father, little children must grow up
And to grow we've got to learn to trust
And to trust we've got to cling to You

And when You tell me You will hold me close
It's the very thing I need the most
But it's the very hardest thing to do

I've got this pain inside me
It speaks to me loud and clear
When there's so much to gain there's always so much to lose

That's why I'm learning to trust in You
In everything I do
I'm learning to trust in You

'Cause I know in my heart that You're true
I'm learning to trust in You
But sometimes it's so hard to do

Keep calling me, drawing me closer
Don't let me hold back
Whatever it takes I must break through

The heart of a child is broken
But his time has come
Whatever he lost, I'll find in You

That's why I'm learning to trust in you
In everything I do
I'm learning to trust in You

'Cause I know in my heart that You're true
I'm learning to trust in You
But sometimes it's so hard to do

I'm learning to trust in You
In everything I do

David Meece,"Once a good, young King came by, early in the morning
Hope soared, nearly to the sky, early in the morning
Yet that first hope nearly died with so little warning
The good, young King was crucified early in the morning

In the stone cold tomb He lay, early in the morning
Laid with Him the hope of day, early in the morning
Saints and Angels fearful, pray, yearning for a dawning
Breaking on the silent grave, early in the morning

Hallelujah, oh, the bright dawn breaks
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, oh, the sweet King wakes
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Long the anxious claws had gripped, early in the morning
Now vanquished claws have slipped, early in the morning
Now the bragging dragon trips, head so high, now fawning
Mouth denied, forever drips, early in the morning

Hallelujah, empty claws proclaim
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, now the good King reigns
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Steady in the waning night, early in the morning
Risen Morning Star, our Light, early in the morning
Dragons breed again to fight, fearful is their taunting
Yet, we trust, Lord, Thy great might, early in the morning

Hallelujah, Saints and Angels sing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, praise the risen King
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

It should be so right

To find the years that shaped my life

Of my most painful memories

Going home, going home
Lord someday I'm going home
To a place where I know I belong
Where the ghosts and the fears
And the shadows disappear
Oh His angels bare us there

You see a distant light
Lifting up my soul
To meet the God who gave us life

Children don't you weep

The clouds that held no rain
Illusions remain and memories mock the truth

No matter what we've done
Today can be our once in a lifetime
For yesterday is gone
Tomorrow may not come
This moment is our once in a lifetime

In spite of the tears the chill of a winter's light
The sorrow of the night
My cold lonely past is melting away from me
As by God's grace I see this moment is mine
My moment of truth forever

No matter where we've been
No matter what we've done
Today can be our once in a lifetime

And give to them a life that they could
never have before

Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

David Monte Cristo,"Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power, but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

Can you imagine when this race is won?
Turn our golden the faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the madman

Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever

Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever young

Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?

It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever

So many adventures given up today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
Oh let it come true

David Monte Cristo,"There's a lady who's sure 
All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows 
If the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
In a tree by the brook 
There's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll. 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.",Stairway to Heaven
David Moore,"I took a real good look deep down in my soul
I had been knocked down
I was down for the count or so it seemed
I didn't know which way to go
But by the grace of God
He lifted me up
And my faith was restored

Once I was lost
But now I'm found
And I'm heaven bound
Once I was lost
But now I'm found
And I'm heaven bound

I didn't know what to do or where to go to
I was in a really dark place
The answer was here all along
And that's why I wrote this song
To tell you about my Jesus and my faith
The stories in the Bible
And about the grand love that Jesus has for us all

Once I was lost
But now I'm found
And I'm heaven bound
Said once I was lost
But now I'm found
And I'm heaven bound

(Repeat first verse after guitar solo)

Once I was lost
But now I'm found
And I'm heaven bound
Once I was lost
But now I'm found
And I'm heaven bound
Yes I'm heaven bound
Yes I'm heaven bound

The gentle winter's on the way.
Still I sit here on this balcony, 
And smoke my brain away,
Waiting on that phone to ring. 
Wondering which day that it will be.

(Chorus)
Oh Carrie I pray one day you'll go back home, 
To the warmth of Southern Georgia where you belong,
And leave all the pain you've felt from me,
Here in Missouri.

(Verse 2)
Oh you were just a young girl,
And I swore I could change.
Every day that you forgive me,
Is just another one you'll waste.
You came here in search of something true.
I ???? your searching isn't through.

To know that won't be happy ever after.

There's an old man dressed in his Sunday best just waitin' on green

Just a baby blue parking lot Gremlin
Not exactly a magnet for the women
Until I hung that surfboard out the back

For tips and caddies at the local court
The night I mixed both drinks down on the wharf
Flirtin' with the college girls getting my barefoot wet out in the world
Fell in love 100 times

Time was mine and life was easy
Just like those ocean breezes
Coolin' off the afternoon
Wasn't long underneath the moon
We had a beach fire and a pile of wet clothes
Layin' back watchin' the skin glow
Gotta smile when I think about those tan bod bikini tops
So hot
Summer job days

The end of August came
And the crowds went home
Beaches deserted and the girls were gone
Yeah I waved goodbye to the time and place
And that two lane back to the interstate
I look back I still look back when

Time was mine and life was easy
Just like those ocean breezes
Coolin' off the afternoon
Wasn't long underneath the moon
We had a beach fire and a pile of wet clothes
Layin' back watchin' the skin glow

David Nail,"Usually take one last pass through town
Stop the car and touch the ground
Watch those streetlights swayin' in the breeze
Decorated store fronts
Rusty old gas pumps
Try to fill my mind up
With somethin' before I go
Picture postcard memories
You know they always make for good company

I don't know no town
Like the old town
Even when the miles are many
I feel like I'm still around
Deep inside me
Like rings through an oak tree
Yeah, there something 'bout a Sunday when I'm gone
That keeps me turning home

I'm standin' here beneath these billboard lights
Takes me back to those autumn nights
Hometown bleachers packed real tight
As we marched down the field
My feet would swing from a dropped tailgate
Out on Airport Road real late
No one could walk a line too straight
We usually made it home alright
And glory days I cant re-live
Stories I'll never forget

And I don't know no friends
Like the old friends
I never seem to laugh now
Like I did with them
But deep inside me
A piece of my history
Yeah, I hear their voices even though they're gone
Yeah it keeps me turning home

Never twice the same way does it start
And sure enough she stole my heart
On the old gym floor, spinnin' round and round one night
And though we both tried hard to wait
We sure did love the taste
Of the sweet love being made and prayin' I got it right
Graduation came and went
Along with all the time we spent

And I don't know no love
Like the first love
When I think about the best times
She's the one I think of
Deep inside me
All though the taste is bittersweet
I see her smilin' even though she's gone
And it keeps me turning home, yeah
It keeps me turning home",Turning Home
David Nail,"It's hard to find the perfect time to say something
You know is gonna change everything
Living with the shame,
It ain't nothing like the pain that I saw on her face
Now me and my pile of things
That she threw out the window,
Drowning next to me
No seven years of good can't hide the one night I forgot to wear that ring

So let it rain, let it pour, if she don't love me anymore,
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me,
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve,
Let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain

Best thing I remember was the young familiar taste of someone on my lips,
It's to late to turn around,
When the shades start coming down,
The guilt you feel's the last thing on your mind

So let it rain, let it pour, if she don't love me anymore,
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me,
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve,
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain
So let it rain, let it pour, if she don't love me anymore,
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me,

David Nail,"It's killin' me to write the word ""goodbye""

But I know that my leavin'
Will spare us both the pain

Now the taxi's at the gate
I guess all that's left to say
Is in teardrops at the bottom of the page
""I love you Desiree""

It'd be easier to leave if I were mad
But it's hard to lose the best you'll ever have
And to write this note to you
Was the hardest thing to do
But not as hard as bein' a poor boy
Who can't afford a girl like you

You never told me anything at all

Now I'm out on the road and asking myself why
I never told you that my love was true
Well, I thought you knew
Yeah, I thought you knew

Heard it from the motel man, you were here two nights ago
That means I'm closing in on my last chance to let you know
That I'm sorry girl for the things I guess I didn't say

Ripples in the holy water, kneelin' in the light that is fadin'
Askin' for forgiveness 'cause she knows that it is me that she is breakin'

She rides on the edge of no tomorrow in a rusty El Camino
She flies as wild as the wind on the border of Laredo
She rides away
Questions in the dark
She rides away
Angel flyin' with my heart

Mystery surrounds her, she's the moonlight in the daylight, ain't no answer
Blacktop on the sand while the desert just goes on and on forever
She told me when I met her she would leave like it was written in red letters

And Mainstreet was my street that night
So I called up Samantha
And asked her the chance of us runnin' out neath the moon light

And like it was then I feel her on my skin

Crankin' up ""Born To Run""
Turn left out the drive with the pistons open wide
And I came back a prodigal son

My spirit was broken, she threw the door open
I love you not I told you so
When I hear mama tried I still break down and cry
And pull to the side of the road

Our first trip to the ocean, your first time on a plane
When you look over your shoulder, baby, you can choose
To remember me however you want to
That's how I'll remember you

The dress that you were wearin', soakin' up the stains
I can still see your mascara, though I can't recall the pain
Of what came after
You were even beautiful tellin' me goodbye
Maybe my version of the truth is just a lie

I savor the sweet as if the summer's all we were
And ever will be, oh, and I still see

That you found a boy and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true

Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind, Ill find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

No worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

You were whispering my name
Every star, every scar
Every mark upon my heart
Up and fades away

I feel myself missing
Everything I threw away
Every dream, every scene
Every song we'd ever sing
Got lost in yesterday

I've been trying to do without you
But I can't give up this fight
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight
We can make it to tomorrow
If we can find the morning light
Everything will be alright
If I can kiss you tonight

If I still think about you
Every thought, every step
Every tear and every breath
I swear I do
Yeah, that's all I ever do

David Nail,"All gathered 'round in our Sunday best
After the service on them old church steps
Congregation spilling into the streets
Ain't it funny how the preacher's words
Disappear out here on the curb
Once the weight of an old friend's body and your hands meet

Tending bar up in Syracuse
Momma called when she got the news
Hell, I don't know who she'll miss more, you or me
No, it didn't feel real, no not 'til now
Behind this long black Lincoln in our little town
Rolling by buildings I never thought again I'd see

And I can't help but think about all that we could have been
Had you not stayed here and settled for a life with him
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Buried is the secret that was us

I can still see you standing there
Swollen eyes and snow in your hair
And your shaking voice say you couldn't get past the shame
Eight weeks into a nine month ride
Either way it's still a lie
Carrying your child with another man's name

And I can't help but think about all that we could have been
Had you not stayed here and settled for a life with him
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Buried is the secret that was us

I walk up and shake his hand, tell him just how sorry I am
And what I wouldn't give to have you back
I wonder if you're looking down on all who is gathered 'round
Knowing one day I too will find peace

And I can't help but think about all that we could have been
Had you not stayed here and settled for a life with him
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

David Nail,"Look at that worn out rusty engine
Sitting there begging for a spark
Don't look like much in that condition
But there was a time you should've seen her run
Down every back road in Lyle County
Under every streetlight up on Main
You sitting there drumming on a dashboard
Both of us falling like a fickle rain

We were
Cooler than December, hotter than July
Young and strong
Some things aren't meant to last forever
But that don't mean you forget 'em when they're gone, so come on

Legs as long as the trails that cut through
Those back acres to the river bend
She had her daddy's temper and her momma's flair
Made people talk but did not care

Slow summer on a Friday
Here we go again, wild in the wind
Mama knows she’s gonna be late

Hit the party just to watch her dance
Good to go when she grabs your hand
Like a shot from a gun, it’s a dead run
The first leg of a getaway plan

You burn rubber when you smoke them tires
Day’s gone and the night’s on fire

She’s telling you turn off the highway
The sunset melts all the blue away
Blackbird watching on the telephone wire
Whiskey on her lips and the night’s on fire

Littered with stars close enough to touch
July promise in the back of that truck
Her every move was taking you higher
You try to play it cool but the night’s on fire

She’s a seat laid back, a boy’s dream
Drawin’ hearts in the window steam
She’s a gettin’ you right, knows what you like
And pours it on like gasoline

When you know what you’re headed to
What’s a red blooded boy to do

David Nail,"I was a hard-going push mowing hard-laying kid
Baseball and MTV
Turned into a blue jean midnight Chevrolet cigarette do about anything
Spend a decade chasing a dream 
And a love and I cough me a couple I guess
But for ever thrill that I chased down
It's easy to confess
I found a better kind of crazy
Now that I've got babies

And good things come to those who wait
Used to think that's just something people say
So imagine when you get the news
After years of trying
Not just one but two

She was Memphis ol' miss outta my league
Saturday night friend of a friend
Once the fuse was lit
The fire burned quick
Two months she was moving in
We were just getting by
Still newlyweds high
Not tried, but oh so true
We were half empty bottles
Of barefoot wine
Free falling and bullet proof
But I've found a better kind of crazy
Now that I've got babies

And good dreams come to those who wait
Used to think that's just something people say
So imagine when you get the news
After years of trying
Not just one but two

You were prayed about

Even had us a couple good names
After four hard years and no close calls
And no one else to blame

That you're right beside me praying

You're 5' 3"" born in Carolina

And Friday night free
You're dashboard singing

Sweet as forgiveness
From the moment that we met
I never knew I had a fighter

I know when you're silent
The silence says more than a scream
And I know when you say that you hate me
It ain't what you mean
When you say that you'll leave and you'll leave
But only for a while
For just a while

You're stubborn and strong
Crazy as New Orleans
Your faded blue denim
A diamond on the town

The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

David Olney,"These poor threads can only make poor clothing
Clothing I will wear on my emotions
They will never keep away the cold
These poor threads can only make more clothing

An empty gun I carry on my shoulder
I was never born to be a soldier
But I was never born to run and hide
An empty gun I carry on my shoulder

Sleight of hand done by a poor magician
Fingers fumble in his indecision
I just can't seem to make things disappear
He cries
How can I bring them back again
These poor threads can only make poor clothing",[Untitled Track]
David Olney," Sun burned hot it burned my eyes
Burned so hot I thought I'd died
Thought I'd died and gone to hell
Looking for the water from a deeper well
So I went to the river but the river was dry
I fell to my knees and I looked to the sky
Looked to the sky and the Spring rain fell
I drank the water from a deeper well
Well well well well
I drank the water from a deeper well

Well I fell in love like a baby child
Fell for a touch and I fell for a smile
Smile turned bitter and her touch turned cold
I could not keep what I could not hold
So I ran with the moon and I ran with the night
And the three of us made a terrible sight
Whored and we gambled with the money we'd steal
Looking for the water from a deeper well
Well well well well
Looking for the water from a deeper well

Well the moon got weak and he soon was gone
And the night got sick and he died with the dawn
Died with the dawn with a drink in his hand
Too sick to walk to drunk to stand
Time stood still but I ran wild
And I got my fill with a crooked smile
Woke up on the floor of a jailhouse cell
Looking for the water from a deeper well
Well well well well
Looking for the water from a deeper well

Sun burned hot it burned my eyes
Burned so hot I thought I'd died
Thought I'd died and gone to hell
Looking for the water from a deeper well

I fell to my knees and I looked to the sky

And business your pleasure
I wish that the pleasure was mine

I don't care if killing's a crime

David Olney," Oh, the women 'cross the river
Carry water from the well at break of day
They talk to one another
God only knows what they might say
You might get an education
After years of dedication
You might finally get a glimpse
Of what is right and what is wrong
But the women 'cross the river
They knew that all along

Oh, the women 'cross the river
Work with tools that are ancient and handmade
They plow their fields in perfect rows and then
They rest beneath the shade
Now we have learned to build
Out of concrete out of steel
And our buildings last a thousand years
But then even they are bound to fall
But the women 'cross the river
Never learned to build a wall

Oh, the women 'cross the river
Are as gentle as the dew upon the ground
How I love to hear them laughing in the rain
When it makes that perfect sound
Now a soldier with a gun and a battle to be won
Might kill you with a bullet
And you'd never even know the reasqon why
But the women 'cross the river
They can kill you with their eyes

David Olney,"Lightning spoke to the wind, ""The devil's in me today, my friend
Do you see that old oak tree down yonder?
Blow like hell and bring down thunder
When your raging's through, I'll cut that oak in two""

The wind began to moan, the old oak tree began to groan
Thunder raged like hell's own daughter
The air was filled with fire and water
Laughing viciously, lightning struck that tree

The old oak tree began to shudder
But he held his ground like some old soldier
His ancient pride was burnt and shaken
But something deep inside did waken
He raised his limbs just like Moses

And blossomed roses
He blossomed roses
He blossomed roses

The sky is clear, the air is clean
The earth is brown, the forest green
The ancient oak he still is standing
With strength surpassing understanding
Like dreams a noble mind composes, he blossoms roses

He blossoms roses, roses, roses, roses",Roses

David Olney," Have I ever told you
I was once quite the ladies man
My suits were Italian
My color vermillion
My words soft as satin
The language of love

My life was the movies
And I was the leading man
The dashing romantic
With a touch of the tragic
My profile was perfect
And the language was love

Yes, sir, Mr. Barrymore
You must have been something back then
They must have been wonderful years
And they won't come again
Yes sir, Mr. Barrymore
Can I pour you another?

The women were lovely
In the flickering Hollywood light
Of course, there was Garbo
And Dietrich and Harlow
The look was come hither
And the language was love

And my God! the parties
The nights were as bright as the days
The air smelled like honey
The stars shone like money
In the roar of the twenties
The language was love

Yes sir, Mr. Barrymore
You must have been something back then
They must have been wonderful years
And they won't come again
Yes sir, Mr. Barrymore
One more on the rocks?

This was a gay town
As wild and as free as the night
We lived with abandon
We loved with a passion
We were storybook heroes
In the language of love

But what was I saying?
Where has everyone gone
Quickly bartender
Pour me another
Better make it a double
One more for the road

Yes sir, Mr. Barrymore
Are you sure you can make it alright
yes the bar's closing down
Better call it a night
Yes sir, Mr. Barrymore
Let me call you a cab ",Barrymore Remembers
David Olney,"The strange young man who comes to me
A soldier on a three day spree
He needs one night's cheap ecstasy 
And a woman's arms to hide him
He greets me with a courtly bow
And hides his pain by acting proud
He drinks too much and he laughs too loud
How can I deny him.

Let us dance beneath the moon
I'll sing to you 'Claire de Lune'
The morning always comes too soon
But tonight the war is over
He speaks to me in schoolboy French
Of a soldiers life inside a trench
Of the look of death and the ghastly stench
I do my best to please him

He puts two roses in a vase
Two roses sadly out of place
Like the gallant smile on his haggard face
Playfully I tease him
Hold me neath the Paris skies
Let's not talk of how or why
Tomorrow's soon enough to die
But tonight the war is over
We make love too hard too fast
He falls asleep his face a mask
He wakes with the shakes and he drinks from his flask
I put my arms around him

They die in the trenches and they die in the air
In Belguim and France the dead are everywhere
They die so so fast there's no time to prepare
A decent grave to surround them
Old world glory old world fame
The old worlds gone gone up in flames
Nothing will ever be the same
And nothing lasts forever
Oh I'd pray for him but I've forgotten how
And there's nothing nothing that can save him now
There's always another with the same funny bow
And who am I to deny them

David Olney,"My name is Josiah
I've come down to the river 
I don't care to see what's behind me 
I've traveled alone
I'm a long ways from home
There's no need for you to remind me
The past I once had's
Gone rotten, gone bad
There's no loving smile to console me
Well, the future's unknown
But back there at home
There's no one now left to hold me

My days once flew by
Like the geese in the sky
Flying high over Avery County 
In our little mountain home
I never felt alone
It was me and Mama and Daddy
Daddy worked now and then
Odd jobs for a friend
But he made most his money off moonshine
We barely had enough
But we always had love
I never went to sleep hungry or crying

Daddy left home one night
With a load of white lightnin' 
Said he was heading for Charlotte
But he never got that far
Him and his car
Crashed halfway down Kimbrough Mountain
That left Mama and me
Living off charity
And what little Daddy had left us
And pretty soon the bank
Was breathing down our necks
Saying they was going to evict us

Well a man come around 
He'd just moved to town 
He started sweet talking Mama
At the end of her rope
She'd 'bout given up hope
She believed when he promised to love her
He preached and he roared
Like a man of the Lord
His message was Hell and Damnation
When I stood in-between
My mother and him
He said, ""Your boy here's in need of salvation.""

With his high holy ways
He treated me like a slave
Said I was born of the Devil
He beat me til I bled
Then he left me for dead
His eyes shining wicked and evil
Well I ran off that night
In the autumn moonlight
I could hear Mama crying for mercy
I found a boat by the river
I got in and untied her
To the sound of his unholy cursing

Long as this river flows
I reckon I'll go
Til it runs out into the sea
If he follows me there
I'll kill him I swear
He's got no more power over me 
If my Mama were alive
I'd tell her goodbye
I'll see her someday way up yonder
Now the sun's going down
To the river I'm bound
Fare thee well Avery County
Now the sun's going down
To the river I'm bound
Fare thee well Avery County",Avery County
David Olney,"Some work and slave for all of their days 
And they'll do anything whatever it pays 
Some of us search and we find other ways 
Me, I turned to thieving 
A little bit here and a little bit there 
Always some danger but i didn't care 
As long as I felt I was getting my share 
That's all I ever believed in 

From the day I was born I understood 
One way or another I'd wind up no good 
One night I got caught, always knew that I would 
The charges were robbery and murder 
I broke into a house for money and jewels 
Some old man tried to stop me, poor misguided fool 
I killed him and left him in his own bloody pool
I ran but was caught by the soldiers 

They bound me and beat me and put me on trial
It was all cut and dried, it took a short while
""Have you anything to say?"" I only smiled 
And said, ""Judge, let's get this over."" 
I was led from the courtroom and back to my cell 
For a man 'bout to die I was taking it well 
With no hope of heaven and no fear of hell 
Only silence and darkness forever 

I awoke from a dream in the middle of the night 
The door burst open and in streamed the light 
A man was thrown in more dead than alive 
On his face I could see the blood glisten 
I could tell at a glance he'd been beat black and blue 
He lay their unconscious but then he came to 
I said, ""Tell me, friend, what on earth did you do."" 
He said, ""I told them but they wouldn't listen."" 

Told them what?"" I asked but he didn't speak again 
He just lay there quiet in his blood and his pain 
The morning broke, it was starting to rain 
The guards come in and they got us 
Out to the courtyard in the cool morning air 
A crowd was waiting. Why were they there? 
Two small-time losers, what did they care? 
I'd have thought they'd already forgot us 

The next thing I heard was the governor's own voice 
He raised up his hands and the mob ceased its noise 
""According to custom I'm giving you the choice 
Which of these men should I pardon?"" 
The mob went crazy and cried out my name 
Shouting, ""Give us Barabas!"" again and again 
The governor sighed and said, ""My hands are clean."" 
The mob shouted, ""Give us Barabas!"" 

But what kind of freedom is this that is mine? 
To spend all my days in search of a sign 
To have my life saved and to never know why 
To owe such a debt to a stranger
I will go with the wind to a far distant land
I will not cease my wandering til I understand
I will tell everyone, every woman and man 
Of the strange things I have beheld here 
Of the strange things I have beheld here

Fast as fate he fades into the darkest heart of night 
And everything that went before is soon enough behind him
Except the visions in his head that serve only to remind him 
Of other days and other nights and other arms that held him 
Of longing looks and loving sighs and other lies she'd tell him

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Just let you leave without a trace?
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh ooh

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now

And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Take a look at me now

Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry

So many reasons why

I have been waiting for

Watching trains go by.
All of my life, 
Lying on the sand watching seabirds fly.
Wishing there would be
Someone waiting home for me.

Something's telling me it might be you
It's telling me it might be you
All of my life...

Looking back as lovers go walking past
All of my life,
Wondering how they met and what makes it last.

If I found the place,
Would I recognize the face?
Something's telling me it might be you.
Yeah, it's telling me it might be you.

So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to wake
And we've so much love to make

I think we're gonna need some time
Maybe all we need is time

David Osborne,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
David Osborne,"Growin' up you don't see the writing on the wall.
Passin' by, movin' straight ahead you knew it all.
But maybe sometime if you feel the pain,
you'll find you're all alone; everything has changed.

Play the game; you know you can't quit until it's won.
Soldier of only you can do what must be done.
You know, in some ways you're a lot like me.
You're just a prisoner, and you're tryin' to break free.

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky.
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher.
Gonna be your man in motion.
All I need is a pair of wheels.
Take me where the future's lying: St. Elmo's fire.

Burning up; don't know just how far that I can go.
Soon be home; only just a few miles down the road.
And I can make it, I know I can.
You broke the boy in me, but you won't break the man.

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky.
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher.
Gonna be your man in motion.
All I need is a pair of wheels.
Take me where the future's lying: St. Elmo's fire.

I can climb the highest mountain, cross the widest sea.
I can feel St. Elmo's fire burning in me, burning in me.
Just once in his life a man has his time.
And my time is now; I'm comin' alive.

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky.
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher.
Gonna be your man in motion.
All I need is a pair of wheels.
Take me where the future's lying: St. Elmo's fire.

David Osborne,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

In love forever

The moment that you speak 
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are 
Songs to be sung 
Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you make me feel so young",You Make Me Feel So Young

Can't take my eyes off you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare

There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that is real
You're just too good to be true

David Osborne,"Strolling along country roads with my baby. 
It starts to rain, it begins to pour. 
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin. 
I feel a shiver run up my spine.
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.

Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside. 

After a while we run under a tree. 
I turn to her and she kisses me. 
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves 
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes.
Sharing our love under stormy skies.

Oo, I hear laughter in the rain, 
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.

Oo, I hear laughter in the rain, 
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.

David Osborne,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden

It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

David Osborne,"Last night I waved goodbye,
Now it seems years
I'm back in the city
Where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you,
Bringing us near

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

Time in New England
Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

I feel the change comin'
I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out
All the love that I have
With you there's a heaven,
So earth ain't so bad

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you
Again
Again",Weekend in New England
David Osborne,"We walked to the sea, just my father 'n' me
And the dogs played around on the sand
Winter cold cut the air, hangin' still ev'rywhere
Dressed in gray, did he say hold my hand
I said love's easier when it's far away
We sat 'n watched a distant light

We're two ships that pass in the night
We both smile and we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

There's a boat on the line where the sea meets the sky
There's another that rides far behind
And it seems you and I are like strangers a wide ways apart
As we drift on through time
He said it's harder now we're far away
We only read you when you write

We're two ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight

We're ships that pass in the night

We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight

That strips my conscience bare

'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft

My heart says yes indeed in me

El que te hace subir hasta las nubes sola 

Antes de que vuelvas a llover 
Déjame que te levante 
Antes de que cambies 
Déjame que nos mezclemos en un baile 

Por que tú eres como el mar
Yo como el aire

Tú sabes que soy el aire 
Pero te miro y no hay nadie 
Por que no jugamos a inundar los valles 

Y a provocar huracanes 
Para que nadie nos caye 
Y de noche iluminar tus mares 

Que se detenga el mundo si te encuentro sola 
Busquemos la manera de parar las horas

The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

This love har taken it's toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
The turn around and leave again

This love har taken it's toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright

Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do

David Pabon,"Fue en esta misma casa, donde yo te hice mujer
Sobre sabanas de seda corría tú desnudes
Frente de mil espejos, tu cuerpo sin ciclón
Dejando entre sus reflejos, la semblanza del amor

Y ahora tengo ganas
De volver a andar tu cuerpo
Porque me hace falta
Besar tus labios, rozar tus pechos
Subir hasta la cima de tu cuerpo

Y ahora tengo ganas
De volverte amar de nuevo
Porque me hace falta
Besar tus labios rozar tus pechos
Subir hasta la cima de tu cuerpo

Sobre esta alfombra de sueños
Tus prendas se durmieron
Y por tu labios sedientos
Brotaron los te quieros

Aun conservo en mis manos
La ternura de tu piel
Que acaricie con locura
Desbordándome en tu ser

Y ahora tengo ganas
Unir tu cuerpo al mío, con amor de piel a piel
Y ahora tengo ganas
Vida te mostrare lo que es querer

Y ahora tengo ganas
Nuestros cuerpos se unirán
Por este amor que no se acaba

Y ahora tengo ganas
De susurros tus labios me repitan que me aman
Y ahora tengo ganas
Tengo ganas de que sientas como la primera vez

Y ahora tengo ganas
Que vivamos del amor cada mañana
Y ahora tengo ganas
Recorrer tu cuerpo entero con ansias
Y salvajemente

Y ahora tengo ganas
Pasa el tiempo y quiero
Amarte aprovechemos este instante

Y ahora tengo ganas
Vida has de mi cuerpo tu refugio
Y ahora tengo ganas
Para confesarte que tu amor
Y tú ternura me hace falta

Y ahora tengo ganas
Decir que has sido tú la única dueña de mi alma
Y ahora tengo ganas
Del placer estas ansias de amarte
Y al fin desbordarme en tu piel

Y ahora tengo ganas
Ya cansado y agotado descansar sobre tu cuerpo
Y ahora tengo ganas
Ahora tengo ganas de sentirte un poco más
Y ahora tengo ganas pero sabes de qué tengo ganas

Voy a borrar de mi mente
Y mi alma todo rastro de amor
Si te vas a marchar procura no volver

Pues construiré una barrera de orgullo
Para tu insensatez, combatiré tu crueldad
Ya no me vas a engañar procuraré
No volver a vivir el frio de tu invierno

Alma de hielo porque fuiste granizo
Y escarcha con mi amor de fuego
Alma de hielo porque el frio

De tu desamor se congelo mi sueño
Y aquellas noches que fueron
De pasión hoy son puro invierno

Si te vas a marchar no pienses
Que esta vez me quedaré como un tonto
Vencido guardando mi fe

Si te vas a marchar me espera lo peor
Voy a borrar de mi mente
Y mi alma todo rastro de amor
Ya no me vas a engañar procuraré
No volver a vivir el frio de tu invierno

Y escarcha con mi amor de fuego
Alma de hielo porque el frio

De tu desamor se congelo mi sueño
Y aquellas noches que fueron
De pasión hoy son puro invierno

Puro invierno
(Por el frio de tu desamor alma de hielo)
No vuelvas porque fuiste tan cruel
Y tan fría conmigo pagarás lo sufrido
No quiero más regaños pues voy
A recuperar todo el tiempo que ha perdido

Alma de hielo fría como
El viento no quiero estar contigo
Voy a borrarte de mi mente
Y estoy decidido a vivir sin tu amor

La pasión que tú me dabas se acabo
Y yo sigo ardiendo en fuego
Alma de hielo trataré de no vivir el frio
De tu invierno de tu invierno

Well, make a wish, baby
And I will make it come true
Make a list baby, of the things I'll do for you
Ain't no risk in lettin' my love rain down on you
So we can wash away the past so that we may start anew

More than an easy feelin'
She brings joy to me
How can I tell you what it means to me
Flow like a lazy river
For an eternity
I finally found someone who believes in me
And I'll never leave
(Now I've found all I need)

(Beside me) Need your lovin' here beside me
(To guide me) Keep it close enough to guide me
(Inside of me) From the fears that are inside of me
You´re the biggest part of me

(Forever) Got a feelin' that forever
(Together) We are gonna stay together
(Forever) From now until forever
You're the biggest part or me
You're the life that breathes in me
You're the biggest part of me

You changed my life
You made it bright
And I'll be a savior to you
For the rest of my life
Oh, the biggest part of me",Biggest Part of Me

David Paquette,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

It is seldom that a dream comes true

That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along

And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

David Pfeffer,"That time when we were crossing the Atlantic
The moment that we reached the middle
You turned to me and said something romantic
I've won the race and you're the medal
And all the ocean liners we were passing
Had nothing on our sail and whistle
As the waves were rolling we were dancin'
Like we had enough, to lose a little

So sure we were contenders
So strong and willing to fight

But it's a long way down when you're far from the ground
And I've been falling most of my life
And though the sun shines on even after you're gone
I feel sorry for the wasted light
Wasted light

Spill off the port into a crowded main street
Looking for somewhere to settle
And soon enough we're lost inside the mystery
We'll be strangers before night has settled
With so much to say we said too little

Back then
We were pretenders
So young
And ready to fight, oh

But it's a long way down when you're far from the ground
I've been falling most of my life
Though the sun shines on even after you're gone
I feel sorry for the wasted light
Oh, I feel sorry for the wasted light

Oh

And it's a long way down when you're far from the ground
I've been falling most of my life
And thought clock ticks on even after you're gone
I'm just shaken' hands with wasted time
I'm still praying you'll come home one night

Oh it's a long way down
When you are far from the ground
And the sun shines on even after you're gone
I feel sorry for the wasted light
I'm still praying you'll come home one night

So here I am crossin' the Atlantic
Maybe see you at the middle",Wasted Light
David Phelps,"I was takin' a trip on a plane the other day
Just wishing that I could get out.
When the man next to me saw the book in my hand
And asked me what it was about.
So I settled back in my seat-
""A best seller,"" I said.
""A history, a mystery in one.""
And then I opened up the book and began to read
From Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

He was born of a virgin one holy night
In the little town of Bethlehem.
Angels gathered round him underneath the stars
Singing praises to the great I Am.
He walked on the water, healed the lame and made the blind to see again.
And for the first time here on earth we learned that God could be a friend.
And though he never ever did a single thing wrong
The angry crowd chose him. And then he walked down the road
And died on the cross and that was the end of the beginning.

""That's not a new book that's a bible,"" he said, ""and I've heard it all before.
I've tried religion- its shame and guilt and I don't need it anymore.
It's superstition, made up tales and just to help the weak to survive.""
""Let me read it again,"" I said, ""listen closely, 'cause this is gonna change your life.

""The end of the beginning,"" he said with a smile.
""What more could there be? He's dead.
You said they hung him, put nails in His hands
And a crown of thorns on His head.""
I said, ""I'll read it again but this time there's more,
And I believe that this is true.
His death wasn't the end, the beginning of life
That's completed in you.
Don't you see he did all this for you!""

Did you know that God could be a friend.
Tho He never ever did a single thing wrong,
He was the one the crowd chose.
Then he walked and he died but
Three days later

David Phelps,"You tried to run so that no one could desert you
Always looking for the perfect place to hide
You build up walls so that no one could ever hurt you
And yet the loneliness made you cry

Bridges all burned
And no where to turn
But to Heaven

Miles and miles away
Love saw you there
Stretched out His hand to reach you
Across the lonely ocean of your tears

And He'll walk upon the waves
If that's what it takes to save you
Love doesn't have the heart to stay
Miles and miles away

He has the grace to cover any distance
Always looking for the lost and weary soul
And though He never stops offering forgiveness
And to the one to run, a welcome home

David Phelps,"Just an ordinary day in Heaven, lookin' down the Streets of Gold.
You can hear the strings and the angel wings, see the saints of Old. Then suddenly God breaks a smile, and begins His song,
""Look my Son is comin' home!""

Open up the Pearly Gates of Heaven.
Build another mansion next to mine.
Everybody dance and shout for joy around the throne.
Set another place at the table.
Sound the trumpet loud and clear this time.
Hallelujah, my child is comin' home.

Now they say the only time God sings is when a lost soul believes.
And they say that there's a celebration there beside the Crystal Sea. And God, Himself, directs the choir and the welcome band.
And then He sings out once again.

Open up the Pearly Gates of Heaven.
Build another mansion next to mine.
Everybody dance and shout for joy around the throne.
Set another place at the table.
Sound the trumpet loud and clear this time.
Hallelujah, my child is comin' home.

Come on, play the anthem strong.
Come on, join in, sing along, sing it strong.

It's not a dream, God will make all things new that day
Gone is the curse from which I stumbled and fell
Evil is banished to eternal hell

No more night, no more pain
No more tears, never crying again
And praises to the great, ""I am""
We will live in the light of the risen Lamb

See all around, now the nations bow down to sing
The only sound is the praises to Christ, our King
Slowly the names from the book are read
I know the King, so there's no need, no need to dread

No more night, no more pain
No more tears, never crying again
And praises to the great, ""I am""
We will live in the light of the risen Lamb

Oh, that's prepared just for me
Where I will live with my Savior eternally

If it doesn't begin and end with love
Did you know that you are the reason

Break free, break free
Loose the chains that have held you tight
Break free, break free
Cleanse all your shame in love's healing tide
Of mercy, sweet mercy, break free

There is no law that can save us
No way to find redemption on our own
Cause Jesus stepped in and forgave us
So no one has the right to throw a stone
Release the guilt you've been holding inside
Step out of the darkness and into the light

Break free, break free
Loose the chains that have held you tight

And freedom from everything you've wrong

Break free, leave them all behind you
Break free, let the love of Jesus find you

Trying hard to take a step of faith
You're so confused and you're so alone
Standing face to face with the unknown

Every need you have God already knows about it
Still He longs to hear from you
I believe, if you put your trust in Him
That is where the road of faith begins

If His eye is on the sparrow, when it comes to me and you
There is no place He won't go and nothing He won't do
Like a mother cradles a child, His grace covers us somehow
So whatever you go through, God will take care of you, you, you

Change is never easy, but it?s just part of living
There's so much more that we can see
A higher place so far above it all
Is ours when we're faithful to His call

There is no place He won't go and nothing He won't do

But I can’t fool myself
And though temptation tells me to doubt You
I’d never be that cruel to myself

Lord, I need You to see me through
'Cause when all is said and done
What it really all comes down to
Is that You’re the only one

In my heart of hearts You’ll always be there
Always be there
In my heart of hearts You’re my everything
My everywhere

I walk the grass that I think is greener
But the color fades to gray
Could an illusion be any meaner
Than the one that test Your faith

Lord, I need You to see me through
'Cause when every truth is told
There’s a light that shines out from You
When the eyes of the night turn cold

In my heart of hearts You’ll always be there
Always be there
In my heart of hearts You’re my everything
My everywhere

Oh, I don’t wanna be the one
Who looks back with regret, no no
I just want to be the one in faithful prayer
When love is waiting there

Lord, I need You to see me through
'Cause when all is said and done
What it really all comes down to
Is that You’re the only one

It's flame cannot endure
A scarlet rose withers brown
To lose it's fragrant lure
The moon illuminates the night
To vanish at the dawn
Oh but love, love goes on

Fortunes fail and disappear
Like castles in the sand
And power spoils and causes fear
But yields to stronger hands
Fame lasts for a moment
Then in a moment, it is gone
Oh but love, love goes on

Oh, beauty fades and passion wanes
And faces show their years
Oh, death steals a lover's touch away
But time dries up the tears
Tunes are soon forgotten
And singers lose their song
But love goes on

A baby boy, a starlit night
Kings on bended knee
Healing hands bringing sight
Then tortured on a tree
A woman sings, rejoicing
""He is risen, he is gone""
Because love, love goes on
Oh love, oh love goes on",Love Goes On

Desperate families torn apart

David Phelps,"The last thing that I remember
I think it was mid December
I rolled out of bed to take on another day
Of bills to pay

Oh, I should have noticed the signs
When reading the morning headlines
But all I could see was what mattered then and there
Like what to wear

Before I left for work I kissed my wife and kids goodbye
Then fumbling for my keys, my eyes were drawn up to the sky
Sky is blackened, could it be a thunderstorm, it looks like rain
Wind is twirling, clouds are swirling, could it be a hurricane?

I pulled myself together
And said it was just the weather
Cause I never dreamed it could be my final day
To live that way

Yeah, I went to church on Sundays
Believed there was only one way
But when it began, I guess I was in denial
For just a while

So I turned on the radio to occupy my mind
But as I drove to work my thoughts were pulled back to the sky
Sky is blackened, could it be a thunderstorm, it looks like rain
Wind is twirling, clouds are swirling, could it be a hurricane?

Then suddenly, the sun eclipsed and tremors struck the ground
As brilliant light had split the sky I heard the trumpet sound

Halleluia, Halle-Halleluia
O the angels sang
Halleluia, Halle-Halleluia
Finally redeemed
Halleluia, Halle-Halleluia
Prophecy fulfilled, Jesus is revealed

Or the fame

It's not about a great position
It's not religion

Was not a guarantee
That the road would not be rough

So you ask me, what's the big attraction
Peace, love, hope, satisfaction
It's a complete chain reaction
Peace, love, hope, satisfaction

I've heard the stories of the narrow road
Some say it's a heavy load
And the way is steep

I've been there, I can testify
The vows of sacrifice
Are hard to keep

But still I chose to turn the other cheek
And to wash my brother's feet
And to give myself away

So you ask me, what's the big attraction
Peace, love, hope, satisfaction
It's a complete chain reaction
Peace, love, hope, satisfaction

When I'm trapped inside His freedom and I'm lying on the altar
And the last part of myself has been crucified
When I'm wearing all His riches in the ashes of my will
I am clean, I am whole, I am satisfied

The way he showed his faith was how he lived it out

So what will be remembered of what he left behind?
What will stand the test of time?

How to love your neighbor, how to love your wife
Wrap your arms around your children and pray with them each night
Thank God for all the good things 'cause the good things are enough
The ties that bind and leave behind a legacy of love

He worked a second job to make the ends all meet
But somehow managed to always be there for me
Showed me how to listen, how to stand for what is right
And taught me all the things that really matter in this life

How to love your neighbor, how to love your wife
Wrap your arms around your children and pray with them each night
Thank God for all the good things 'cause the good things are enough
The ties that bind and leave behind a legacy of love

And as I look into the eyes of my daughters and my sons
I hope I've stood for something that they'll want to carry on
Cause life is far too short not to finally realize
That it's long enough to make a difference in someone?s life

So I'm gonna love my neighbor and I'm gonna love my wife
Wrap my arms around my children and pray with them each night

Breathing the salt air from the coast
Ten years old with my eyes pressed closed

Remembering first love’s tender kiss
Mourning the loss of my innocence
The bittersweet taste of it on my lips
Life is a church

These are the sacraments
This is the altar, love is the spirit
Making the blue planet turn
Life is a church

Watching my baby being born
Written all over you, pain and joy
Holding your hand, it’s a little boy

Watching my baby being born
Written all over you, pain and joy
Holding your hand, it’s a little boy

Ashes to ashes, earth to earth
The preacher throws in the first handful of dirt
My little boy asks me, “Does goodbye always hurt?”

Written all over you, pain and joy
Holding your hand, it’s a little boy

David Phelps,"Heavenly Father
We heard Your precious name

It stands to reason that a name is just a word
It can be easily forgotten as soon as it is heard
But one name was spoken before the world's first day
And it will be here when everything that is has passed away

Delivered from the lips of God
To Mary's ears on angel wings
Jesus, Jesus

The word that came to life for us
The song that all creation sings
Jesus, oh, Jesus

The proudest nations of the earth
Have come and gone
But Jesus, the name lives on

When I'm awakened by a terrifying dream
And desperation reaches up and clutches me
When I am so afraid that I don't even know what to pray
I simply speak it and I feel it and it chases fear away

Delivered from the lips of God
To Mary's ears on angel wings
Jesus, sweet Jesus

The word that came to life for us
The song that all creation sings
Jesus, oh, Jesus

The proudest nations of the earth
Have come and gone
But Jesus, the name lives on

Eternal hope and promise
The ever breaking dawn
When time itself is over
The name lives on

Delivered from the lips of God
To Mary's ears on angel wings

The word that came to life for us
The song that all creation sings

David Phelps,"No mountains ever moved one inch at my command
No waters parted at my feet
I'm just a witness to the wonders God can do
Through willing instruments like me

And when my best seems insignificant and frail
He offers me the source of strength that cannot fail

Power, straight from the Father
Making me stronger
And I know it's not my own
Power, straight from the Father
Love like no other, I've ever known

There are days when circumstances spin out of control
In ways I just can't understand
It's as if the best of my intentions have conspired
To reveal how powerless I am

But there is One whose voice alone
Brings me peace
And when on high, he hears my cry
He gives to me

This holy energy can save, redeem and heal
Like electricity, it flows through me and I can feel",Power

David Phelps,"She gently falls asleep
Her head is laid upon my lap
The highway sings a lonesome lullaby

My daughter here beside me
My little boy is in my backseat
Outlined by the headlights from behind
And I ask the Lord to freeze us here in time
As my son stretches out his hand to mine

Silhouette sent from heaven
Paint a portrait of eternal things
A fleeting glimpse like a vapor
Bring remembrance of what is holy
Clean and pure, unblemished and unflawed
Come to me, sweet visions of God

I hear her whisper sweetly
""I made this for you, daddy""
A crayon masterpiece says, ?I love you?

For Peter Pan, Pinocchio, and Pooh
They cling to every word until the end
Then they close their eyes and drift to Never land

Like a shadow in the night
A familiar face I fail to recognize
But he is there in pigtails
Peek-a-boo and piggyback rides
A kiss, a gentle touch, a baby?s cry

Glory to the King who captured my heart

Faithful is the one who called me by my name

",If That Isn't Love
David Phelps,"It was 1983
On a snowy Christmas Eve
With my family
And the Christmas tree and lights

That was when it all went wrong
Someone turned the TV on
And the evening news
Broadcast the blues that night

But my dad saw my despair
He put his arm around me there
He said, ""Let me tell you this
It's my lifelong Christmas wish""
He said

If everyone believed
Oh, what a happy place it would be
We'd live in peace on earth as a great big family
If everyone believed

Now the years have come and gone
But that Christmas wish lives on
It's the thing I pray
When the holidays draw near

You see the news is still real sad
And people, they're both good and bad
But you just might cope
If you spread some hope and cheer

So as we sing 'Joy To The Earth'
And celebrate the Savior's birth
I pull my family close to me
And tell them how the world could be

If everyone believed
Oh, what a happy place it would be
We'd live in peace on earth as a great big family
If everyone believed

And I know that it's easy to say
Oh, but I'm gonna dream it anyway
'Cause a dream becomes a song
And when we sing it we pass it on

If everyone believed
Oh, what a happy place it would be
We'd live in peace on earth as a great big family
If everyone believed, if everyone believed

",If Everyone Believed
David Phelps,"In the beginning there was the Word
Pure love was spoken to reach every man
They stopped and listened but all that they heard
Was language that they could not understand
No joy, no peace, no hope in sight

So He came with starlight and love in His eyes
No regal welcome for His infant cries
There have been many babies to become a king
But only one King became a baby

He left behind His throne of pure light
Gave up His crown that we might be free
He chose a manger that Bethlehem night
And reaching through time and space He saw me
With no joy, no peace, no hope in sight

So He came with starlight and love in His eyes
No regal welcome for His infant cries
There have been many babies to become a king
But only one King became a baby

He could have chosen to break through the sky
With anthem and angel wing
But He knew we'd understand a baby's cry
And learn love from a servant King

So He came with starlight and love in His eyes
No regal welcome for His infant cries
There have been so many babies to become a king
Only one King, one King became a baby",One King
David Phelps,"I just came back from a trip along the Milky Way
I stopped off at the North Pole to spend the holiday
I called on old dear Santa Claus to see what I could see
He took me to his workshop and told his plans to me

Now Santa is a busy man, he has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas Day
You better write your letter now and mail it right away
Because he's getting ready his reindeers and his sleigh

You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why

Straight to where a baby lay
Rich and poor and lonely
Bow before this sight

A star has led them to this place
The word that's been echoing through space
Becomes a child tonight

Light to shine in the darkest night
Light to make all the wrong things right
Light to show everyone the way
Light to shine where a virgin lay
Tonight

Angel voices fill the air
Angel wings are everywhere
Light so bright it?s blinding
Shepherds shake with fright

A warmth begins to flood the hill
Fear not, peace to you good will
Comes to earth tonight

Light to shine in the darkest night
Light to make all the wrong things right
Light to show everyone the way
Light to shine where a virgin lay
Tonight

Light will be so bright
It will shine through the darkest night
Send down Your holy light

Star of David, the Prophet?s star
Yahweh, God come to where we are
Star to mark the Messiah?s birth
Star of heaven now touches earth

Light to shine in the darkest night
Light to make all the wrong things right
Light to show everyone the way
Light to shine where a virgin lay

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!",O Holy Night!
David Phelps,"Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There’s always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it’s hard at the end of the day

I need some distraction
Oh, beautiful release
Memory seeps from my veins
Let me be empty
And weightless and maybe
I’ll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear

You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You’re in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There’s vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack

It don’t make no difference
Escaping one last time
It’s easier to believe
In this sweet madness
Oh, the glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear

You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You’re in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here
You’re in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

But my seeing is better,
I can see 
Through the tears,
I've been realising that,
I bought this ticket
And watching only half of the show,
There is scenery and lights
And a cast of thousands,
Who all know
What I know, 
And it's good
That it's so 

It's in everyone of us
To be wise
Find your heart
Open up both your eyes,
We can all know everything 
Without ever knowing why,
It's in everyone of us
By and by,
It's in everyone of us
By and by",It's in Everyone of Us
David Pomeranz,"Candles burning,
Glasses are chilled
And soon, she'll be by

Hope and pray she'll say that she's willing
To give us another try

And if all these plans i made
Don't melt the lady's heart,
I'll put on the old forty-fives

And maybe the old songs,
Will bring back the old times,
Maybe the old lines will sound new.
Maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder,
Maybe old feelings will some through
Maybe we'll start to cry,
And wonder why, we ever walked away

Maybe the old songs,
Will bring back the old times
And make her want to stay, oh oh

It's been too long without
Seeing her face light up
When I come home.
Been to many hours I've waited
Staring at the phone

Sweet old songs I'm counting on you
Bring her back to me
I'm tired of listening alone

Maybe the old songs,
Will bring back the old times,
Maybe the old lines will sound new.
Maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder,
Maybe old feelings will some through
Maybe we'll start to cry,
And wonder why, we ever walked away

Maybe the old songs,
Will bring back the old times
And make her want to stay, oh oh

David Pomeranz,"Too many billion people running around the planet
What is the chance in heaven that you'd find your way to me
Tell me what is this sweet sensation
It's a miracle that happened
Though I search for an explanation

Only one thing it could be
That I was born for you
It was written in the stars
Yes, I was born for you
And the choice was never ours
It's as if the powers of the universe
Conspired to make you mine until the day I die

I bless the day that I was born for you
Too many foolish people try to come between us
None of them seem to matter when I look into your eyes
Now I know why I belong here
In your arms I found the answer
Somehow nothing would seem so wrong here
If they'd only realize that
I was born for you and that you were born for me
And in this random world, this was clearly meant to be
What we have the world could never understand
Or ever take away until the day I die

David Rothenberg,"Now, in this faraway land
Strange, that the palms of my lands
Should be damp with expectancy

Spring, and the air's turning mild
City lights, and the glimpse of a child
Of the alleyway infantry

Friends, do they know what I mean
Rain, and the gathering green
Of an afternoon out-of-town

But Lord I had to go
My trail was laid too slow behind me
To face the call of fame
Or make a junkyard's name for me
Though now this other life
Has brought a different understanding
And from these endless days
Shall come a broader sympathy
And though I count the hours
To be alone's no injury

My home, was a place near the sand
Cliffs, and a military band
Blew an air of normality.",Exile

A statue of a fool made of stone

So the world can see
And inscribe, 'The World's Greatest Fool'
And name it after me

Mmm, and there on his face, a gold tear should be placed
To honor every tear he shed
And I think it would show and everyone would know
Concealed inside is a broken heart

Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.

I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,

I caught her when she fell from heaven.
One to ten, baby girl's an eleven.
And I ain't tryin to spit no game,
But I'm tryin to figure out from where you came
Because a star like hers,
Man, it really occurs in a world like this,
Only way you ever meet a girl like this.
Get up in a spaceship and take that trip.
We kinda have a way with words.
We even start a convo to get at her.
Every other (shake that) becomes a blur.
Be my mistress, I'll be your sir.
I love her, the way she is,
The way she are, my shooting star.
And I pray that you never change. (Never ever change)
Just stay the same cuz

Nah baby girl,
That's a shootin star with your name.
I ain't gonna lie,
I've told a lot of lies and played a lot of games
But with you it's not the same.
For you, I'm'ma ride.
I want you by my side,
I feel like them ghetto boys. (She playin with my mind)
I'm'ma tell you one more time. (She playin with my mind)
For you I'm'ma grind.
You were there through the pain.
You stood right by me, thanks to you I survived.
I guess it's true what they say,
Love is blind.
We together til the day that we die.
Until death do us part.
Baby you my heart,
They can take all the houses and the cars.
But they'll never take my superstar.

I love just who you are,
I ain't gon' try to change ya.

David Ryan Harris,"Well they're moving to St. Augustine
That's where the cool folks go
Packing up those bibles man.
Nothing for them here they know.
Moving further south so spread some peace and love,
Ask them why they're going and they'll say,

A voice came from above.
It said ""See that nothing works like change.
Change is good for you
See the world. See what you can do.
There's a lot you're gonna have to answer for out there

Well, that old man's ass is rotting in his favorite rocking chair
Hell and high water drop by, and they always find him there.

I found a genie on my front porch and I'm gonna use him
To get next to you.

Just for a moment alone with you honey.

I've got a feeling I'm wasting my wishes
I've got a feeling you'll never be true
I've got a feeling your mountains too high
Your river is too wide
I've got a feeling you've got a genie too,
And your genie is stronger than mine.

You're mine all mine, you're my destiny.
I'll have my genie use his trickery to tempt and entice
Oh, to bring me next to you.

If I had a dime for every time
I thought of you, I would be through.
Scraping for crumbs behind the sun.
You would be mine if I had a dime.

Yes, I believe.
Without a sign, lets steal away each tempting charm
To please, entice or appease.

David Ryan Harris,"Bow down! Hail the king karma! Watch me work.
Bow down! Hail the king karma. Watch me work
Sometimes I am concerned that the floor might
Collapse beneath my weight, because I am so heavy.

Sometimes I worry that I just might drown those
Who wish to stand with me because I get so deep.
And there are days when I could make light-headed pawns
Of men who follow because I get so high.

A twist of fate, a stroke of luck,
Divine intervention pale sickly in my light.
What does your life owe to king karma?
Bow down! Hail the king karma! Watch me work.

Sometimes I wonder why you people try
To hide your actions from me because I see it all.
What goes around comes around.
What goes up most come down.

Come now, children. Haven't you been warned?
Sometimes I feel like Santa bringing love
To those who do deserve and hell to those who don't.
Other times I may play the piper
Without mercy or comparison, only scorn.
What does your life owe to king karma?

Your path must soon go through king karma.

What does your life owe to king karma?
Your path must soon go through king karma.

What held me, now floats above.
Fall from grace, no longer loved.
My lover,
Your branches too.

We've so much in common, me and the leaves.
How can a dancer dance if you don't sing?
Trade in all that was sunshine for a shady view.
I never knew silence could be so deafening.
All that used to surround
Twinkles above you.

We could speak the twisted speak of love
(no voice or sound)

Nothing more to say.

If she were the blue sky and I was a sparrow
And I'd bathe within the folds of her dress
She'd open and invite, cradle me in flight,
Soak me in daylight, get me to fly right
Hold me and caress.

And my mind opens like a vista, gold in hue.
And my thoughts run like a river under an ocean
And the sandman is given his due (yes he is, yes he is)

I can't wait for me to get some sleep.
The sandman is on his midnight creep.
Slumber enter, take me deep, until I am rested.

My dreams sore like an angel in flight
And my worries run like the sunshine runs from the night.

I pray the lord my soul to keep until I am rested.

Two suns in a closed jar.
Liquefy the viper for the show.
Cut the cord and breathe deep.
Racing in a dead sleep.

Sympathize in silence for the crow.

Swear to be a prophet.
Steal the jewel and drop it.
Lay another crack out in the road.
Happenstance and visions, stupid superstitions.
Sympathize in silence for the crow.

[Chorus]
You lose the battle when
You start believing in everything you read
It's just like Stevie said.
A cosmic free for all with caps and crystal balls
When you believe in things like the archetype in wings.

The humble and meager,
The perpetual griever,
Sing 'em to sleep, but the crow just gets no sympathy.

The humble and meek,
The tired and the weak,
Sing 'em to sleep, but the crow just gets no sympathy.

King underachiever
Half an unbeliever.
King the sleeping serpent down and go
Hide out in the open, cowering but hoping.
Sympathize and side for the crow.

David Ryan Harris,"Thought I'd make the cloudy sunny
But it seems my lover hates sunlight.
Went to see her in the morning
But it seems she's only home at night.
Bought a wagon full of roses
And my lover says she hates the smell.
Most folks say that I should give up
But I think its too early to tell.

[Chorus:]
So I try to second guess her
Hoping she'll profess her undying love and loyalty.
Continue to pursue her
Hoping to renew her sense in faith in guys like me
That woman is bound to see me
One day she'll believe me
You'd think I was Houdini 
With these tricks up my sleeve (2X)

So I brought her doves from Eden
And she says the feathers makes her sneeze
Suffice to say I'll never give up
Even though this woman's hard to please
By now I could be an artist
I spend so much time at the drawing board
Most folks say I should give up
But I kind of dig being ignored

Notice how I focus all my hocus pocus and my energy on
Making her mine",Tricks Up My Sleeve
David S. Ware,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

David S. Ware,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember

Imagine life with no jails and no laws
And no harassment on brothers in fancy cars
Now why they want to trap me, make me a slave
They just mad cause a ghetto nigga break bread

I'm on the ground cuffed up like a dog
Said my cuffs too tight, but they laugh when they see me fall
I guess my skins too dark for them to hear me
I know they don't like me, for some reason I think they fear me
Quit tripping on my chains and my rangs
I want to hit em, but I didn't cause I maintained
They got me FED's on the scene and they sware I got the cream
And the stolen truck green, canine all up in my jeans
They don't realize I'm a soldier
I had a pissed, ask your son, I know he gotta see-Murder disc

Mom and pops tap my phones, but you know I ain't slangin' rocks
Take me to jail but I tell em take me off the scene
My first call go to P, he put my mind at ease
You told me not to trip cause it's a bigger picture
And if your tank don't put it on TRU, I'm a come and get ya

Woah, picture life without the crooked cops and without the cell blocks
Would you sell rocks, or would you be like me, I'm shell shocked
And I went through stressin' (why), cause I'm already strapped,
bulletproof vesting
Waiting to be tested by the devil on that level
I used to sit on the porch with my uncle Ben
And I watched the murder scene when I was 13, dad, why they come for me
And it made me crazy, and it made me lose my mind
And from time to time it crossed my mind
What if there wasn't a crime 
Now Slim, would you kill for me and everything that's true for me
If there was no law, and nobody was superstars
No state trooper cars to follow, you wouldn't have to swallow
Your rocks, so toss the glocks with the hollow
I would kill a rich man and drink his blood, would it bring me riches
Or would I just be selling my soul to them wicked witches
We already in babylon, the world is a ghetto and God is like the don,
nigga woah

Now we get only get one minute to pray and a second to die
Could you picture the dark side before I let these bullets fly
From out my 4-5 see, I know what you mean
Is it life or that imagine living life with no breath
My imagination's a motherfucker with a bullet stretch
Too much killing, I won't supply the world with a vest
But that's impossible, killing its unstoppable
As long as they got bullets and guns they got niggas that's droppin' em
Real niggas from that ????? the world that's all about

Como si hablara con alguien
Pero a su lado no hay nadie

Va a volver algun dia

So straight up, I won’t be there tomorrow when you wake up
But wait up, listen baby girl don’t get it twisted
We gave it all we had, attempted everything to fix it
Another broken heart, I can’t risk it
Girl its plain is simple, we took a shot and we missed it
And now the place I piss in, is where the memories of us are livin'
Down the drain, no more pain
But baby I ain’t kidding, when I tell you that you’ll always have a place in my life
But tonight I’ma make it right
Yeah, I’ma say

Yeah, I guess I’m back at square 1,
Our love is rare, it’s too bad it wasn’t well done
Yeah we had a good run, never reached the finish line
Wish that we could start again, wish we could go back in time
Wish we could have seen the future, now we’re history
Consistently sending me text, saying that you’re missing me
I’m tryina forget about you, baby girl you’re killing me
And when you hear that last line, you’ll probably be pissed at me
But what can you, girl I’m tryna do me
Clean, slate, fresh start, baby I’m a new me
I promise that you’ll always have a place in my life
But tonight I’ma make it right
Yeah, I’ma say

Sugar, down a lonesome road 

Distant lover (lover, lover, lover)
Sugar, how can you treat my heart
So mean and cruel
Sugar, sugar
Treat every moment that I spent with you
I treasure every like it was a precious jewel
Please, Lord have mercy

Please, come back, baby
Somethin' I wanna say
When you left
You took all of me with you
Do you wanna hear me scream
Come back and hold me, girl",Distant Lover
David Sea,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow",Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow
David Seering,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Whisper what you'll bring to me

All the stockings you will find
Hanging in a row

""Love me do"" I think it was and from there it wouldn't take long
Got himself a guitar, he used to play it every night
Now he's in a rock and roll outfit everything is alright

Don't you know
Johnny told his momma ""hey momma, I'm going away
Gonna hit the big time, gonna be a big star someday""
Momma came to the door with a teardrop in her eye

Johnny said ""don't cry momma smile and wave goodbye""

Suddenly everyone loved to hear him play his song
Watching the world go by surprising it goes so fast
Johnny looked around him and said ""hey I made the big time at last""

Filled with a bunch of motherfucking cowards

And one thing theses motherfuckers in America know 
They know we wont do shit

I'm grippin' the neena
Visions of 911, visions of three 6's no 7's
This is bushanomics, George is a modern day Ronald Reagan

When do we stop playin', when do we stop pimpin' and start sprayin'
50 shots for every cop that popped sean bell, his body layin'
But they don't quit cause they know that our generation wont do shit
Nothin', nada, but every rapper is a shotta or a don dotta
Or a killer but you ain't killin' nothin' in this piece unless its another nigga

How can he tell her he loves her

Does it still run down to Donny cove?

Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

For flames live such a little while

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream","Laura, song (for the film, ""Laura"")"

Was the sweet love I had with you

1927 Kansas City
Said he liked the color of her hair
Then he walked her home and told her she was pretty

Then they spent a little while
Letting their hearts learn to smile
Doing things that lovers always do
He said ""How many kids?"" She said ""A few""
And it's 1927 Kansas CIty
Folks were drivin' round in their stutz bearcats
With straw hats, parasols, the fashion of the day
Summer nights with ukulele strumming
They were humming to the tune of moonlight bay

Batchtub gin and movie stars
Two more payments and the baby's ours
It's the little things that make this live so sweet
When your only worries were your two sore feet
From dancin' in the street in Kansas City

So fine the little ol' couple in love
Space in time the little ol' couple in love

Nowadays there's silver in her hair
The kids have come and gone like seasons turning
Forty years since they met at the fair
But he still brings her flowers in the morning

Knowing when the shadows fall
Life's a circle after all
Reminding her their love can never end
Suddenly she's just a girl again

I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue

I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.

Back when I was goin' to school, I never learned a thing
All I did was daydream, a-waitin' for the bell to ring
I had a certain teacher, I always tried to impress her
When she stood up in the classroom, I would mentally undress her
Then one day I decided, that I would write a little letter
She said the spellin' was a masterpiece, the punctuation could be better
I understood what she was saying, I got the gist of her sentiment
She said I don't mean to be degrading, but here's the way that it shoulda
    went

[Chorus (2x):]
I love you period
Do you love me question mark
Please, please exclamation point
I want to hold you in parentheses

Right on up to high school, people said I was a writin' fool
All my letters became really great, with punctuation that was never late
But I was havin' trouble meetin' girls, I never knew the things to say
Soon I had 'em all overwhelmed, when they heard me talk this way, like this

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep

She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it

The words ""I love you, till the day I day""

The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heals

My head is just a hat place,
My breast an empty shell,
And I've a faded dream to sell.

Why does nobody care for me?
When there's no love to hold my love,
Why is my heart so frail,
Like a ship without a sail?

Out on the ocean,
Sailors can use a chart;
I'm on the ocean,
Guided by just a lonely heart!

Still alone, all at sea,
Still there's no-one to care for me.
When there's no hand to hold my hand,
Life is a loveless tale,

David Stephenson,"Truly, I didn't mean to hurt you so.
Hands down I'm a loser my friends told you so
Because when I drink I get drunk and when I'm drunk 
I get mad and when I'm mad I run away.

It's a curse a family curse I curse the day that I was born. 
I've runaway too many time I guess my sheep is shorn. 
You said to chose between the booze and you I picked the booze. 
You spread your wings, lightened your load, got a running start and flew away.

Julie, don't take your love, don't take your love downtown.

It's not that I haven't tried to get my shit together. 
I'm not the sharpest pencil in the box film at 11. 
I tried to take some action I tried to find my handle. 
I took 13 steps off a 12 step pier lucky I was wearing sandles. 
There I go again rambling on.

I'm not begging you to come back I realize I've burned my bridges. 
I apologize for my wicked ways and hope to be forgiven. 
But you can choose to smear my name by hanging out and partying, 
Drinking beers with smokin' blokes but baby let me warn you.

The folks downtown are cruel. 
Especially to girls like you. 
They'll chew you up and spit you out. 
I'm not trying to scare you
Just stay out of downtown.

Julie don't take your love downtown.",Julie

Way down inside.
A whispering sea
Of towering trees;

And steals away with it's heart.

Of ancient bells that bring.

I saw my own self seated in his chair.
With gaze abstracted, furrowed forehead,
Unkempt hair.

I thought that I had suddenly come to die,
That to a cold corpse this was my farewell.
Until the pen moved slowly upon paper,
And tears fell.

He had written a name, yours, in printed letters:
One word on which bemusedly to pour.
No protest, no desire, your naked name,
Nothing more.

Would it be tomorrow?  Would it be next year?
But the vision was not false, this much I knew;
And I turned angrily from the open window,
Aghast at you.

Upon the back of love.
A kingdom raised from ashes,
And held within your arms.
And should the rain break through the trees,
We'll find a shelter there and never leave.
I'll run to you, nothing stands between us now.
Nothing I can lose.
This light inside can never die.

I'll swim the seas inside with you,
And like the waves, without a sound,
I'll never let you down.

There's a beauty here I cannot deny
And bottles that tumble and crash on the stairs
Are just so many people I knew never cared
Down below on the wreck of the ship
Are a stronghold of pleasures I couldn't regret
But the baggage is swallowed up by the tide
As orpheus keeps to his promise and stays by my side

Tell me, I've still a lot to learn
Understand, these fires never stop
Believe me, when this joke is tired of laughing
I will hear the promise of my orpheus sing

Sleepers sleep as we row the boat
Just you the weather and I gave up hope
But all of the hurdles that fell in our laps
Were fuel for the fire and straw for our backs
Still the voices have stories to tell
Of the power struggles in heaven and hell
But we feel secure against such mighty dreams
As orpheus sings of the promise tomorrow may bring

Tell me, I've still a lot to learn
Understand, these fires never stop
Please believe, when this joke is tired of laughing
I will hear the promise of my orpheus sing",Orpheus
David Sylvian,"You were someone to believe in
A place for hope in a changing world
Feeling every moment
Every one of the years spent in your arms

After a lifetime of living
These soiled hands show no life at all
Working at all hours
Never facing the fears here in my heart

Grieving for the loss of heaven
Weeping for the loss of heaven
By the wailing wall

You were someone to believe in
Giving life where there was a will to learn
But it's the nature of living
To count only the years left in your heart
",Weathered Wall
David Sylvian,"Cold morning
Start of another day
Sleeping through the epilogue
Waking to the sound of rain

Driven to the crossroads
Where value's meaningless
What did you do to my faith
In justice, hope and happiness

Social, economical, spiritual
I'm moving to the house of love

Take my fire
Take my food and water
Forget about those promises
Of social good and social order

Lassoed by the cowboys
Tied down and it shows
I'm roping in those bad dreams
And selling off my working clothes

Social, economical, spiritual
I'm moving to the house of love

Gonna take a course of action
To restore my sight
'Til the heart of motivation
Is filled with a golden light

They're hiding in the treetops
Tugging at my coat
Power lines are falling down
And burning in the undergrowth

Social, economical, spiritual
I'm moving to the house of love

As the river runs, tumbles and turns
You know you shouldn't stay
Play the game again
It could be different this time
You may win

Dreaming, dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming
Lying down

Dreaming, dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming
Lying down

I'm moving to the house of love
Moving to the house of love
I'm moving to the house of love
Moving, I'm moving, I'm moving
I'm moving, I'm moving, I'm moving
I'm moving to the house of love

David Sylvian,"Baby, baby
I hate to go
Don`t leave me alone with this sorrow
The body`s heavy
The getting`s slow
Lost in moments
Caught in moments
The night is starless
And stands below
And I need you by my side
Baby, baby
I love you so
Don`t leave me alone in this hollow
When brightness falls
Who`ll come running?
When brightness falls
Who`ll come running in?
Saved by silence
Save by noise
Save by lightning
Saved by joy
Building on emptiness
And all you broken hearted people
Baby, Baby
The hurt heals slow
And who can believe in tomorrow?
When brightness falls
Who`ll come running?
When brightness falls
Who`ll come running in?
The ticket`s exploded
Only one way out
Live in lightness
Lost in lightness
There`s nothing left to write about
And time`s no longer
The greatest injustice of all
On this new day",Brightness Falls
David Sylvian,"He beats the door and breaks his watch
Raids the fridge and eats the lot
No room for silence, pause of thought
To ease the hurt inside him
They placed a barrel at his head
Raging blind and rising
Cursed by saints and all the rest
He can`t stand up for trying
Shot through with anger and desire
A mouth to feed, a room for hire
He drinks 'goodbyes', the bottle dry
Brutalised but smiling
Causing casualties by the hour
Outweighed by stars
And Firepower
Causing casualties by the hour
Waylayed by stars
And Firepower
He beats the door and breaks the lock
Afraid to sleep he won`t let up
No room for silence, pause or thought
To ease the hurt inside him",Firepower

Born in darkness
Built on shame

Climb the ladder
To god's monkey
No songs
To sing

David Sylvian,"He gambles on the saddle
He's pulling on the mane
He thrashes on the horse's back
Ambition is a bloody game

Horse doesn't want to jump
The river looks too wide
Well he faces every hurdle
With a nervous state of mind

Stay with me, breathe deeply
Take three passes back
Turn and make a full attack

And they're tugging at the reins
But he's taken to his wings
And they hit the bank

Heaven may stone him
But jean the birdman pulls it off

His finger's on the trigger
His eye is on the clock
He doesn't give the game away
And quickly fires the bullets off

Six hearts cut short
Still dreaming they're alive
Blown 'round in dusty circles
Like an absent state of mind

Who hunter? who victim?
God love America
He surely doesn't love him

Hitching out of nowhere
Lines of traffic knee deep
A chance to stave the morning off
And get some sleep

Heaven may stone him
But jean the birdman pulls it off

He wears a crucifix
His mother left to him
It's wrapped in chains around his heart
Rusted and wafer thin

Don't count on luck son
All the angels sing
Don't need to check a weathervane
We all know what tomorrow brings

Life is a cattle farm
Coyotes with the mules
Life is a bullring
For taking risks and flouting rules

Who needs a safety net
The world is open wide
Just look out for card sharks
And the danger signs

The flowers died embittered from the start

That night i crossed the bridge of sighs and i surrendered

I looked back and glimpsed the outline of a boy
His life of sorrows now collapsing into joy

And tonight the stars are all aligned and i surrender
My mother cries beneath a southern sky and i surrender

Recording angels and the poets of the night
Bring back the trophies of the battles that we fight

Searchlights fill the open skies and i surrender

Outrageous cries of love have called me back
Derailed the trains of thought, demolished wayward tracks

You tell me i've no need to wonder why i just surrender

I stand too close to see the sleight of hand
How she found this child inside the frightened man

Tonight i'm learning how to fly and i surrender

I've travelled all this way for your embrace
Enraptured by the recognition on your face

Hold me now while my old life dies tonight and i surrender

An ancient evening just before the fall
The light in your eyes, the meaning of it all

Birds fly and fill the summer skies and i surrender

She throws the burning books into the sea
""Come find the meaning of the word inside of me""

It's alright the stars are all aligned and i surrender

The magic has gone
And there in this place

David Sylvian,"I hold you in
A sea of silence
On the borderline of truth
Open violence
I see no sign
I see no place I've loved
Depending on the signs
To find the road

Blackwater take me with you
To the place that I have spoken
Come lead me through the darkness
To the light that I long to see again

I walk with you
But sleep beside her
The summer came and went
It passes us over

I see her cry
I see the face I have loved
Depending on the blind
To find the road

To the place that I have spoken
Come lead me through the morning
For the land that I long to see again",Blackwater
David Sylvian,"Underneath a burning sun
There's always work to be done
We take much more than we care to give away
You'll be the moth, I'm the flame
I'll bless you and keep you safe and sound
Until sunrise comes around again
I'm like a mountain made of stone
I'm like a new day dawning
I'll be here every morning, close to you

We'll sail on a river, way out to the Baltic sea
Love will keep us together
And the tide will draw you close to me
(Never words so true, never words so wise)
Love will keep us together
'Cause there's more to this than meets the eye

I burn a candle in your place
I picture the passions on your face
Feelings that rise on a wave and fall away
All the pleasures have returned
All of the lessons I should have learned
Return again to light, for us to see
You're like the map of buried gold
I search for treasures in your soul
And when I'm gone, you'll know I will come back to you

We'll sail on a river, way down to the salty sea
Love will keep us together
And the tide will draw you close to me
(Never words so true, never words so wise)

When I've broken every door
The ghosts of my life
Blow wilder than before

Just when I thought I could not be stopped
When my chance came to be king

Blew wilder than the wind

But I'm no longer lost

David Sylvian,"Messages ran all over town
Words without sound
Condemned me
And left me for dead
All over again
It wasn't the first time, but this time
Things will never be the same

Ride, ride the very thought into the ground
In the church of the lost and found
The angels cry
Ride, ride until the darkness closes in
Until the ravaged soul begins
To reflect the open skies, ride

Razed to the ground
From the darkest of clouds
Small birds tumbled like rain
Time and again
You may go charging at windmills
In these days
Absurdities never change

Ride, ride until the darkness closes in
Until the ravaged soul begins

It`s medicine to me
But as the hunted live their lives
You`re keeping out of reach

So I keep running, falling
Till I reach the water
Run with me holy man
But when I reach out
I find I`m standing right beside her
Now we`re living
Blessed with all the thunder in the world

Now, should you ask me to come home
To wake up from the sleep
Like a boat inside a storm
Is there no hope for me?

So I keep running, falling
Wade into the water
Run with me river man
But when I reach out
I find I`m standing right beside her
Now we`re living
Blessed with all the thunder in the world",Riverman

I dreamed a thousand dreams
We'd face the days together
No matter what they'd bring
A strength inside like I'd never known
Opened the door to life and let it go

This sun may shine forever
Upon the back of love
A kingdom raised from ashes
And held within your arms
And should the rain break through the trees
We'll find a shelter there and never leave

I'll run to you, nothing stands between us now
Nothing I can lose
This light inside can never die
Another world just made for two
I'll swim the seas inside with you
And like the waves, without a sound
I'll never let you down

Upon a wave of summer
A hilltop paved with gold
We shut our eyes and made
The promises we hold
A will to guide and see us through
I'd do it all again because of you

I'd tear my very soul to make you mine

David Sylvian,"I found the way
By the sound of your voice
So many things to say
But these are only words
Now I've only words
Once there was a choice

And I want to love

Did I give you much?
Well you gave me things
You gave me stars to hold
Songs to sing

I only want to be loved

And I hurt and I hurt
And the damage is done
You gave me songs to sing
Shadow and sun

Why didn't I stay?
Why couldn't I?
So many lives to cross
Well I just had to leave
There goes everything
Everything

Can I meet you there?
God knows the place
And I'll touch your hand
Kiss your face

We only want to be loved

And I want to be love

And I hurt and I hurt

Notes from a suicide
And he will never ever be

It's such a melancholy blue
Or a grey of no significance
Plastic coated surfaces
A space to place his suitcase
As it's passed from A to B

But it's such a melancholy blue
The curtains round the bed are drawn
Broadcast voices from the ward
The humming of machines hurt
But there are distances between

Yes there are distances between

His aspirations visited him nightly
And amounted to so little
Too much self in his writing
Now he will never, ever be

The engine shifts into second gear
They're all aboard, accounted for
It's a journey he must make alone
The black sheep boy is leaving home

It's been rehearsed a thousand times or more
He's well prepared of that he's sure
But still it's such a melancholy blue
As he erased a page of history
Much as he'd intended to

He wouldn't speak or show you he was happy
Though you'd meet him with your eyes
There was a wall that always stood between you
He'd shut himself outside

And the love that he engendered
Would never be enough
For him to feel alive
Warm and tender
He'd shut himself outside

Not a fake or a sham
But dug in deep and fighting
The world could not embrace a man
With so much self in his writing

And he was never gonna be

David Sylvian,"There's a man down in the valley
Who doesn't speak in his own tongue
He bears a grudge against the English
The tune to which his songs are sung

There's a man down in the valley
Who is moving back in time
It's a physical ascension
You can watch him as he climbs

The farmer's wives are at their windows
They've seen him wind his way for hours
They tell the kids to lower their voices
And pretend that they are out

There's a man down in the valley
Trying to stop time in its tracks
His boots lie heavy on the grasses
But it keeps on pushing back

And his wife she was a painter
But now she stains the altar black
He's out bird watching on the islands
And she wishes he'd come back

And he dreams of moving west
Of battles raged against the furies

Stands as proud as you please
The lungs won't full, the heart won't start

And he alone, is a man without qualities

Combed his body for disorders
But the disease lived on in far-off quarters

As a man he settled for less

A life without purchase, no story to tell
And three little bitches fight where he fell

And tell the little girl, and show her what's mine

Abandoned my silence too

With improvised devices, there's bound to injuries

I have cleaned and scrubbed her decks

She moves in a half-life
Imperfect

From a place on the stairs
Or sat in the backseat
Sometimes you're only a passenger
In the time of your life
And there's snow on the mattress
Blown in from the doorway
It would take pack-mules and provisions
To get out alive

There were concerts and car-crashes
There were kids she attended
And repeat indiscretions
For which she'd once made amends
Then there's ice on the windshield
And the wipers are wasted
And the metal is flying
Between her and her friends

She'd abandoned them there
In the hills of Appalachia
She threw off the sandbags
To lighten the load
As soon as the sun rose
The keys were in the ignition
Following the tire tracks
Of the truck sanding the road

There had to be drugs
Running through the girl's body
There had to be drugs
And they too had a name
And the adrenalin rush
Had left her exhausted
When under the blue sky
Nothing need be explained

And there is no maker
Just an exhaustible indifference
And there's comfort in that
So you feel unafraid

And the radio falls silent
But for short bursts of static
And she sleeps in her house
That once too had a name",Snow White in Appalachia
David Sylvian,"Itâ??s a wonderful world
And you take and you give
And the sun fills the sky
In the space where you live

Itâ??s a day full of dreams
Itâ??s a dream of a day
And the joy that it brings
Nearly sweeps her away

Itâ??s a wonderful world
As the buildings fall down
And you quicken your step
â??Til your feet leave the ground
And youâ??re soaring above
All the sorrow below
And youâ??re falling in love
With those you donâ??t know

And your heart feels so wide
And your heart fills so strong

That she promised to call
But the scale of our love 
Is diminished and small

And she doesnâ??t know why
She wakes up each day
And continues to cry

David Syme,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair. 

Scarlet ribbons, there's magic in the air.

David Syme,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

Someone who'll watch over me

David Syme,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Coming home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hanging by a song
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changing fast and it don't last for long

But the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
Rocky mountain high (Colorado)

He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky mountain high

Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly

His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul

One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well

I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa, I don't think I said I love you near enough

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

A thousand different names
They come on two by two
People fade as people do
Came here of my own volition
Could be my decision
Could be
We may still get by
We may still get by

Wandered down on avenue A
The coffee shops, the sweet cache
Of thoughts, and words, and laughter gone
Never-ending stream of what you've
Known so long and long ignored
Don't think so hard, just smoke your cigarette
And fade off into blue
'Cause people fade as people always do

Consequence comes crashing in
The scars, and scrapes, and scratches
All the memories died so long ago
Time is up, but still I'm waiting
Came here of my own volition
Could be my decision
Could be
We may still get by
We may still get by
And we may still get by
We may still get by
We may still get by",F Train

I've seen your anger, crashing down

David Usher,"What if I were you and you were me
Still can't see the forest fire beyond the trees
Now I'm standing in a field of green
The colours burning far as I can see
What do you see?

On my tongue, the galaxies so small
Here I'll drink it down and watch the world dissolve
Now I'm pouring through the universe and slipping
Through the endless stream of time
What would you find?

And I'm flying, floating on the wind again
Hoping it will drag me in
Can't you see I'm laughing?
Laughing at the consequence
Laughing at this circumstance
Don't you know by now?

Wave at all the faces; they go by
Faster that we live, the more we die
Now I'm crashing through the open door
And smiling in a most peculiar way
What would you say?

And I'm falling faster than the waterfall
Opened up and after all
Can't you see I'm drowning
Right here in the open air?
Wishing I could still go clear
Don't you know by now?
Don't you know by now
This is what we are?
This is what we are
Don't you know by now?
Don't you know by now
This is what we are?
This is what we are

Flying, floating on the wind again
I'm wishing that you'd drag me in
Can't you see I'm hoping
Wishing I could see myself
Wishing I was someone else?
But don't you know by now?
Don't you know by now

See there it's crushing the final impression
The stains on the paper
Where words fell like water
Unearth all the changes that never did matter
I think it's beginning to freeze here

Caught in the rage and the fire of things
All the brightness that burns me
I'm fumbling through like a child in the dark
When the nakedness comes
I am shocked by the colour the glorious weight of your skin
Comes alive
And I never thought we'd make it back so soon
Might be nice
But I knew you'd be your own destroyer
Comes a time
And I always thought I'd make it up to you

Here please forgive me
Could we escape all the bitterness piled upon bitterness
Held in the face of the things that I don't understand
Intellectualize over and over
This helplessness suits us
Funny how quiet has slipped to our corners
Worn all our edges away
You are watching breathing and baiting
Wanting and warming and cautiously waiting
For some simple signal to creep cross your conscience
Uncover redemption and oh did I mention
I carried you down to the St. Lawrence River
The banks running dirty the water's beginning to freeze here
Solid by morning
And I'll freeze here
Winter by morning

Comes a lie
And I never thought you'd get me back so soon
Might be nice
But it's only if my own destroyer
Comes alive
And I always knew I'd make it up to you

I saw on your face such a curious grin
As I let go your hand
I was desperate to hold you again
But you're sinking so deep in the water
Outsmarted myself and so easily gave up what I wanted
Solid by morning
What I wanted
Winter by morning

Comes alive
And I never thought you'd make it up so soon

Taste your mind and taste your sex

I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we can make a deal
Maybe together, we can get somewhere

Anyplace is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money

Won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I could both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

See my old man, he's got a problem
Lives with a bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
Body's too young for looking like his

Mama went off and left him
Wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's got to take care of him""
I quit school that's what I did, what I did, what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough that we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we're driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder

And I had a feeling that I belonged
Had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market in the checkout line

I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a big house and live in the suburbs

So remember when we're driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder

And I had a feeling that I belonged
Had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job, pays all our bills
Stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids

I'd always hoped for better
Thought we'd get together you and me would find it
Got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we're driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk

And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder

When you kiss me, Heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose

When you press me to your heart
I'm in a world apart
A world where roses bloom

And when you speak
Angels sing from above
Every day words
Seem to turn into love songs
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be
La vie en rose

I thought that love was just a word
They sang about in songs I heard
It took your kisses to reveal
That I was wrong, and love is real

Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose

When you kiss me, heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose
When you press me to your heart
I'm in a world apart
A world where roses bloom

And when you speak
Angels sing from above
Every day words
Seem to turn into love songs

David Walburn,"On the road of experience, I'm trying to find my own way.
Sometimes I wish that I could fly away.
When I think that I'm moving, suddenly things stand still.
I'm afraid cause I think they always will.
And I'm looking for space and to find out who I am, 
And I'm looking to know and understand.
It's a sweet, sweet dream, sometimes I'm almost there.
Sometimes I fly like an eagle and sometimes I'm deep in despair.

All alone in the universe, sometimes that's how it seems.
I get lost in the sadness and the screams.
Then I look in the center and suddenly everything's clear.
I find myself in the sunshine and my dreams
And I'm looking for space and to find out who I am, 
And I'm looking to know and understand.
It's a sweet, sweet dream, sometimes I'm almost there.
Sometimes I fly like an eagle and sometimes I'm deep in despair.

On the road of experience, join in the living day.
If there's an answer it's just that it's just that way,
When you're looking for space and to find out who you are.
When you're looking to try and reach the stars.
It's a sweet, sweet dream, sometimes I'm almost there.
Sometimes I fly like an eagle and sometimes I'm deep in despair.",Looking for Space
David Waldon,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

He had to get movin'
He had to get movin'
He had to get movin'
And find a cure for his cabin fever
Find a cure for the cabin fever

Iron hog man dancin' with the wind
Out in the morning light
He stayed up late
Dealing with fate
And just made it through the night
Now he's gone gone
And he won't come back
Not for a year or two
But he flies high and he flies low
Like an arrow straight and true

He's got to get movin'
He's gotta get movin'
He's got to get movin'
And find the cure for the cabin fever
He'll find the cure for his cabin fever

And find the cure for the cabin fever
He'll find the cure for his cabin fever

Now don't think I don't love you
Or mean the things I say
But I've got a heart like a sunset
It just keeps slippin' away
I've always been a drifter
I can't sit still too long
I don't want roots like a tree
So I'll keep rollin' on
No I'm not hiding or running away
But there's just something I've got to see
I'll be there in the morning
But I'll be gone sweet breeze

I got to get movin'
I gotta get movin'
I got to get movin'
And find the cure for the cabin fever
I'll find the see you",Cabin Fever
David Wilcox,"We got ice in the fridge
Cold drinks comin' up
Hurry on over
Bring some glasses or cups
Make yourself at home
Turn the music up loud
The jumpin' dancin' with the wailin' crowd

Let it flow down easy
Let it flow down easy
Let it flow down easy
All over your soul let it flow

The way she walks could stop a truck
Her mind will put you out of luck
Her eyes will put you out of house and home
She'll turn your heart to stone
She's today's woman
She takes no lip
She needs no excuses
Takes no prisoners
She knows what she wants
And needs no help
She can do it all by herself

Let it flow down easy
Let it flow down easy
Let it make you feel good like rock 'n' roll should
Let it flow down easy
Let it flow down easy
Let it flow down easy
All over your soul let it flow

Ah love is where you find it
You never say never
The rock told the sea forever and forever
The sea told the sky told the moon told the stars
We've got to stop meeting behind parked cars
Up in the mountains down in the street
Long gone dinosaur with inflatable feet
A polyester wig and a credit card
Tryin' so hard to impress

Ah let it flow up down around and around
Deeper higher set it on fire
Roll it drown it shoot it on down
You've got to be here for",Let It Flow

Light of love when she smiles
I heard her heart beat

Frozen for, no reason
What we say, what we do

I see you like an alibi

Why we remember and why we forget
As you watch yourself
In the fire of a cigarette
Or prevent the demolition of a 
Large public building

The tide is right to go
So, come away to sea with me
There's things that you should know

There's things I'd like to tell you
That words can't seem to say
Unless we're on this simple craft
Sailing far away

Sail around this sound
Far away from shore
Come away to sea with me
Sail your heart once more

Join me in this simple craft
Welcome to my home
The things I'd like to say to you
Are better said alone

So, let your heart sail with me
We'll cast away from town
And we'll sail away on music
Inside this simple sound

Sail around this sound
Far away from shore
Come away to sea with me
Sail your heart once more

This simple craft I play upon
Is made from wooden parts
Its never sailed an ocean
But is sure can sail my heart

And if you feel the music
Then we've raised another sail

Well, it's idling beside me at the light
Sweet sixteen is looking in her rear-view mirror
Making sure her hair-do looks alright

Well, it's my favorite form of stoplight entertainment
Watch what happens when I try to make her smile
You can tell just by the way that she accelerates
She's trying to tell me that I'm not her style

David Wilcox,"I used to walk down every road, holding out a golden key
And I would search the heart of everyone, I was hoping was right for me
And I was searching for a treasure to fill me deep inside
I was searching for a life time friend to walk right by my side
You know how that goes

One day I grew so weary, I could not take another step
I sat upon the roadside, hung my head and wept
And then suddenly I heard a voice come from deep within
And as I listened to the sound I found I was lifted by the wind

It said, you've always had a treasure living deep inside your soul
And you've always had a life time friend and now it's time you know
That the love was only waiting for your signal to begin
But the golden key you were holding out, you were always holding in

I used to walk down every single road, yeah
I used to walk, I used to walk down

David Wilcox,"Winter was gray in my small town sky
When Sarah came back with a smile
Some things just brought her around this whole world
Back to our hometown main street mile

She's come from the land of the desert sun
To warm up this small town street
A shining medallion on sun tanned skin
The silver still holds the heat

It's closer to home than my own home town
Never so far away
So come with me she said to me
I'm gone to Santa Fe

She's got that golden light in her hair
From shining into the sun
She smiled so kind with her ocean eyes
And told me, I'm not her only one

But she said, I know that look in your eyes my friend
You need some highway behind you
So follow me down and I'll lead you astray
Maybe you just might find you're

Closer to home than your own home town
Never so far away
So come with me she said to me
I'm gone to Santa Fe

Well, this town just grew up around me
I never meant to stay
I tried to make my break before
But I, I never got away

When I'm walking with Sarah
I feel I'm set free
Like she could walk past all the guards
And say, this man's with me

Out past the street lights, into the darkness
After the last stop gas
Now all of those things that kept me here
Sarah can take me past

It's closer to home than my own home town

Five days a week, I watch the tube
Five nights a week, I'm watching the radar
Easy job with nothing much to do

Waiting in my air conditioned office
Down a thousand feet below the sand
Looking at the lines upon my fingers
Thinking of the power in my hand

If I start my day, my days are through
And if I set to work, my work is over
Soon as I begin, we'll all be through

Waiting on some action down below

If I start my day, my days are through
And if I set to work, my work is over

David Wilcox,"I went to see an old friend
Who was soon to pass away
He said, ""My life has been so good to me
Now I've still got one more day""

Now he said that as he watched the morning sun
And then he smiled my way
Because he said that every morning
He'd lived his life that way

He said, ""I am the sunshine
You are the sunshine
We are the sunshine
Help me understand
We are the sunshine on the land""

He said this day is like a life you live
It's never here to stay
Because your time is always runnin' by
Like the sun across the day

But it's like lookin' at the sunshine from the earth
The light does come and go
But when you're lookin' at the earth shine from the sun
It's quite a different show
He said it's time you know

That I am the sunshine
You are the sunshine
We are the sunshine
Help me understand
We are the sunshine on the land

Now I'm thinkin' of the things he said
We're walkin' toward the grave
And I haven't lived a life like his
But I've still got one more day

Now you could say it's only flesh and bone
The life that's in your hands
But I like to think it's something more
Like the sunshine on the land

And I am the sunshine
You are the sunshine

Looking through my father's eyes
Way up high
A diamond made of nylon flies

Out of the fishing reel
The string is drawn
Fishing for dreams
Up there and songs

And that's why I'm laughing

Last time I held this line
The pull was strong
Could it be that
Much time has gone?

That's why I'm laughing
That's why I'm laughing
That's why I'm laughing now

Quick as a box-kite wind

And time between
You can be here

How did you find me here?

If I showed to you this child
Who is crying out inside me

I can hold on fine, cause it almost time, for that sun to come 'round again.

where there once was a warm weather crowd.
Even though that summer's been a long time gone,
I can still feel that sun somehow.

When your love grows cold and your heart grows dark
and the blame seems to fall on you.
Well look how seasons must change and don't think it so strange
that your love goes in circles too.

and I know you'll find, that it's almost time, for that love to come 'round again.

David Wilcox,"Near river bend where the stream runs clear
One winter morning of a day last year
I heard a secret that I now can say
Concerning Jamie, who's past away

If you had known her then you'd agree
Her smiling eyes could make a blind man see
She laughed with innocence and she moved with style
Full grown lover with childlike smile

She moved out West where the air is clean
To study poetry at Evergreen
I thought I'd see her in a year or two
Till we heard rumors
That I feared were true

They never found where she went that night
The man she lived with said they'd had a fight
She left that cabin to walk alone
He kept the light on
But she never came home 

She must have gone by the riverside
The searchers say that's how she must have died
The winter water was cold with snow
An icy boulder
And down she'd go

Well I heard the news but I could not cry
I should be shattered but my eyes were dry
To feel no sorrow was my surprise
But the words came easy
For those last good-byes

Till I took a walk by the riverbend
Where once we lingered when she was my friend
I tried to melt the river of tears inside
The river flowed
But joy I cried

She may be gone from this life we know
She may have frozen in the ice and snow
But there's a secret that my heart can't tell
Except to say
That she's safe and well

Late at night in the empty big top I'm

Look, he's working without a net this time
He's a real death-defier

I'm the kid who always looked out the window
Failing tests in geography
But I've seen things far beyond just the schoolyard

There's the spires of the Turkish empire
It's six months since we made landfall
Riding low with the spices of India
Through Gibraltar, we're rich men all

I'm the kid who thought we'd someday be lovers
Always held out that time would tell
Time was talking, I guess I just wasn't listening

There's a whispering rainfall
'Cross the boulevard you slip your hand in mine

At the tears in my eyes

And your words were clear from the start

I don't want to claim you or blame you, but you're always on my mind

At the tears in my eyes

My eyes with the salt water
Wash me clean....again

You just meant to share with me pleasure

Off of the table
You watched as it started to fall

I've never seen that before""

Never mind the turpentine

And gallery lighting too

They all want one of their own
They say ""How much? Who's the artist""
And, ""My what a beautiful home""

He rides the high-wheeler Ford
He's down here every evening since the school let out
An ordinary man would be bored.

Johnny's got the hunger of a high school heart
And a tank full of minimum-wage
So its six lights down, six lights back

He's running on a tether
Tearing at the ground
Trying to find a way to break the chain
This howling in the distance
Its a captivating sound
Can't tell if its ecstasy or pain
Saturday they'll all be back again

All those engines pulling all night long
Still makes a slow moving train
They can scream out their freedom
When the light turns green
But they're bound to come 'round again

Standing at a distance there's the dark haired girl
Johnny doesn't know her name
He howls his engine like a big, black dog

You're cool and mild.

They're laughing in the photograph, but we don't get the joke.
Now why would they be smiling while they're looking down our way?
I guess they're making easy money climbing up the rungs,
From selling us a parasite that's feeding on our lungs.
They must be laughing in astonishment that we believe the things they say.

So look up at the billboard.
See her smiling, sexy and tan.
But the only one who's laughing is the advertising man.

Now crack'll kill you quickly. That's why it's got to go.
They'll get more of your money if they kill you nice and slow.
And the only one who's laughing is the advertising man.

David Wilcox,"My old addiction
Changed the wiring in my brain
So that when it turns the switches
Then I am not the same

So like the flowers toward the Sun
I will follow
Stretch myself out thin
Like there's a part of me that's already buried
That sends me out into this window

My old addiction
Is a flood upon the land
This tiny lifeboat
Can keep me dry
But my weight is all
That it can stand

So when I try to lean just a little
For just a splash to cool my face
Ahh that trickle
Turns out fickle
Fills my boat up
Five miles deep

My old addiction
Makes me crave only what is best
Like these just this morning song birds
Craving upward from the nest
These tiny birds outside my window
Take my hand to be their mom
These open mouths
Would trust and swallow
Anything that came along

Like my old addiction
Now the other side of Day
As the springtime
Of my life's time
Turn's the other way

If a swan can have a song
I think I know that tune
But the page is only scrawled
And I am gone this afternoon

David Wilcox,"Dear Mom and Dad
Here's why I can't home
I can talk to either one of you just fine
When it's either one, alone

But the Thanksgiving table
Is going to be pulled out bigger
If we talk at all
One of you will pull the trigger

I used to run those battle lines
Trying to smooth over what got said
Trying to get a medal
Trying to get some shrapnel in my head
Thought it was my duty
To plead and to implore
But I caught too much crossfire
In your covert war

The television talks, fills the air
So you don't have to start
You claim you territories in the rooms upstairs
To keep yourselves apart

Holy days they bring us all together
After so much left unsaid
You taught us well not to kick under the table
Kick under your breath instead

I used to stand between you
Trying to smooth over what got said
Trying to get a medal
Trying to get some shrapnel in my head

Thought it was my duty
To plead and to implore
But I caught too much crossfire
In your covert war

Of coarse there was the anger where the love is strong
It spilled like gasoline
It's crude but its a power we can draw upon
If it fuels the right machine

I love you and I'd never want to see you bleed
When comments cut like steel
So to hold your fire I'd block the shot and take the hit for you
As if I could not feel

I thought they'd passed right through me
That I had no scars to hide
But now I open up and try to love
And I find they're still inside

I used to run those battle lines trying to plead and to implore
Please won't you hold the cease fire out a little longer
Until the next uproar

I took it all in childhood
But I can't take it no more
'Cause I caught too much crossfire
In your covert war.",Covert War
David Wilcox,"It's like you pass to me this bitter cup
So I can take a sip
And I know that it's likely gonna burn
But never mind the taste of it
I take what I can get
It sure is a hard way to learn

I mean look at how I sip your cup of nasty
Like I'm lucky for a taste to quench my thirst
When love creates an optical illusion
I'm gonna see it just the way it was rehearsed

If I was dying in the desert
I would see shining on the sand
True love, like distant water
On dry land

I liked everything about you, except the way you treated me
But that didn't seem to matter much at first
I longed for you to fill me
Like a wino loves his drink
But every time you filled me with a thirst

If I was dying in the desert
I would see shining on the sand
True love, like distant water
On dry land

'Cause I was looking for a goddess who could save me
So I played the worshipping fool
The colder your kindness
The more it convinced me
You're just that cool

Now just look at how I sip your cup of nasty
Like I'm lucky for a taste to quench my thirst
When love creates an optical illusion
I'm gonna see it just the way it was rehearsed

David Wilcox,"Walking on the railroad rails
Leaning into one another
Balancing so we won't fail
Into timeless friends and lovers

We're still holding hands
Past the place I quite before
On this high trestle span
The distance down is what
We must ignore

Chorus

Balance is no harder after all
Out across this bridge so tall
Balance is no harder
Its just that you've got farther
Now you've just got farther to fall

Walking on the railroad rails
Out across this deep commitment
I can feel your finger nails
Hanging on to old resentment
And I miss that easy smile
Lately its a tight-wire frown
But we've come so many miles
We can make it if we don't look down

Chorus

Farther to fall
Looking all the way down
Maybe you'll drown in it all

But you like to walk this rail for two
As long as words like ""wife"" aren't said
But something comes over you
When you see that span of life ahead

Now you make your choice
Will you turn around and walk away
The tremble in your voice
You turn to me, smile and say
Hey!

David Wilcox,"I'm standing before my old high school.
It's been 10 yrs since I touched the door.
But to heal the old pain we must face it again
so I'll walk down that hallway once more.

I have come to this 10 yr reunion for my heart is still pris'ner of war.
'n if I find it's alright we're escaping tonight.
That's what I came back here for.

Won't you please waltz with me?
I feel like I'm just like I used to be
my heart is locked up here so quietly
believing that you hold the key.

Won't you please waltz me free?
The turns of our steps are untangling me,
free from some dragged around memory
and the rusty old remnants of fear.

And after 10 years,
I'm melting the shackles with tears.

I'm as nervous as if its still high school.
You're happily married I know.
But it's not just this dance that I'm asking you for.
I'm asking you ten years ago.

Remember I wrote in your yearbook?
Could you please waste some time on me?
There's just a few things I must tell you,
but that's as brave as I could be.

Won't you please waltz with me?

This is David. Oh, I don't know
Just talk of how New York has been
Yes, it's easy to imagine,
I've healed a lot since then
I think that we could walk away as friends

It's a clear reception
It's a long connection
And it's all the way across this mighty ocean

I could be there by your night,
Which is my morning
Right now, I'm still at Heath-row at the gate
Well, yes, of course I'm bragging
But didn't it sound great 
To fly across the ocean for a dinner date?

It's a clear reception
It's a long connection
And it's all the way across this mighty ocean

Sure, I've been in town before,
But never quite so quickly
And never from a place so far away
But if this color-carbon ticket
Says that I can fly the ocean,
Surely I can think of what to say.

It's a clear reception
It's a long connection
And it's all the way across this mighty ocean

It's flight 715.

David Wilcox,"She can run beside the stream in the forest
The wind will lift her hair
She can almost see the moon in the waterfall
The music takes her there
She can be wild in the summertime
She does not feel these walls
She can give in, look up, take a deep breath
Step into the falls

She's just dancing
She's just dancing, understand?
She's just dancing, dancing to the band

But when the sweet-talking hunter see's her moving
He's aiming through his sights
His rifle only sees a prize he can capture,
Maybe take her home tonight
Now watch him circle back around
As if he can't quite read
What the writing on her t-shirt say
She spells it, it says
I'm just dancing. Dancing, okay?

She's just dancing
She's just dancing, understand?
She's just dancing, dancing to the band

Don't try to track her trail, hunter
She is not your game
This is a wild-life sanctuary
And wild is why she came

But you're hiding in the blind
So you're a prisoner of your own protection
If it's life you're trying to find

Tomorrow is the ""Big 3-0""
For my birthday present
I've got a place where we can go
It's a lesson in motion
To ride the wildest ride
We're gonna climb to the top of the roller coaster
And look down the other side 

So let me ride in the front car
And you ride right behind
And I'll click my snapshot camera
At exactly the right time
Shoot back over my shoulder
Catch the fear no one can hide
When we tip the top of the roller coaster
And look down the other side
Over the hill

So when the prints come back
We can look at that unmistakable birthday fear
Like your younger days are over now
And its all down hill from here

It was a happy birthday
You surprised us all
So take a look at this glossy picture
I framed it for your wall
It's the moment of truth
It's the top of your youth
The camera don't lie
You might be screaming
But there's a meaning
In the laughter in your eyes
It seems to be saying
""Of coarse there will be fear""
But this is why we stand in line
Spend that time
Make that climb
To finally feel the other side
And it's all down hill from here

We're gonna climb to the top of the roller coaster
And look down the other side

On your hike along the mountain view,
You can wrap the scent in corduroy, 
And bring the mountain home with you.

When you sit beside the ocean's edge
And dream of what might come to be, 
Your fingers keep the taste of salt, 
From the castles made beside the sea.

I'm lonely at work now, 
My hand holds my chin. 
And my mischievous fingers remind me, 
And cover my grin. 

The scent takes me dreaming, 
To wildberry pie, 
And the wind hits my sails 
With the sound of your trembling sigh. 

When we work to make a berry pie, 
Lips can tell where we have been, 
Out picking huckleberries wild, 
To bring the harvest home again.

And on the way we sang a tune, 
What I said is what I meant,
Our love is like a red, red rose 
It leaves a certain subtle scent.

I'm lonely at work now.

A generation - and then the winter wind

It seemed so endless until it gave what it could give

Prosperity will have its seasons
Even when it's here, it's going by
And when it's gone we pretend we know the reasons
And all the roots grow deeper when it's dry.

We would turn this world ourselves our world so small
But slower rhythms - still unheard of

David Wilcox,"They taught us kids in school between the recess breaks
That the universe just sorta fell together like a Big Mistake
It started with a bang that sent the pieces flying
Then it cooled and twirled into dinosaurs and dandelions

It was a Big Mistake to have eyes that see
To have love like this inside of me
To have lips that smile as I swim your kiss
To have minds that will forever every part of this
All the moonlight shrouded in the clouds above and
The autumn leaves and the falling love
The still reflection in the moonlit lake
All, they said, it was a big mistake, it was a big mistake

Now back to science class through the looking glass
We were magnifying little ancestors of our ancient past
Watch 'em break a couple chromosomes, wait a zillion years or so
And get an ostrich, a jellyfish, a kangaroo, and a Romeo

It was a Big Mistake to have eyes that see
To have love like this inside of me
To have lips that smile as I swim your kiss
To have minds that will forever every part of this

The still reflection in the moonlit lake

David Wilcox,"I try so hard to please you
To be the love that fills you up
I try to pour on sweet affection
But I think you got a broken cup.
Because you can't believe I love you
I try to tell you that there is no doubt
But as soon as fill you with all I've got
That little break will let it run right out

I cannot make you happy
I'm learning love and money never do
But I can pour myself out 'til I'm empty
Trying to be just who you'd want me to
I cannot make you happy
Even though our love is true
For there's a break in the cup that holds love
Inside of you

Now I begin to understand you
As you explain the fear you feel
It's when you see me fall into that sorrow
That makes you doubt the love is real
Because lonely wind still blows through me
I turn away so you can't see
But now how can I still be so empty
With all this love that you pour on me?

I guess you cannot make me happy
And that's a money-back guarantee
But you can pour yourself out 'til you're empty
Trying to be just who'd I want you to be
You cannot make me happy
It's just the law of gravity
And that break in the cup that holds love
Inside of me

So if you're tempted to rescue me
Drowning in this quicksand up to my neck
Before you grab my hand to save me
Why don't you ask me if I'm finished yet?
You cannot make me happy
Not when there's empty inside of me
But you can pull yourself right in here with me
My misery'd love to have your company

We cannot trade empty for empty

David Wilcox,"We were there in the woods by the water
We left our packs up against that willow tree
We dove right in, keeping just what we were born with
Our Memories, Knowledge and Dreams

As I swam away from our possessions
I imagined that they were gone forever more
And for once I was glad that all I treasured
Would still be with me as I reached other shore.

So...Let me dive into the water,
Leave behind all that I've worked for
Except what I remember and believe
and when I stand on the farthest shore
I will have all I need

After the blaze burned our cabin down to ashes
Where we'd slept warm, now the sky lets in the rain
I found the strings, frets and rusted latches
But I will never hear that old guitar again
These four walls are only in my memory
Where these stone steps rise to nothing in the air
So one last look and I'm headed for the river
To wash my hands and try to say this prayer

So...Let me dive into the water,
Leave behind all that I've worked for
Except what I remember and believe
and when I stand on the farthest shore
I will have all I need

When my time to live this life is over
I'll tip my hat when I think about that swim
And of all the things that make a life worth living
That only come to those who dive right in

So...Let me dive into the water,
Leave behind all that I've worked for
Except what I remember and believe
and when I stand on the farthest shore
I will have all I need

since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,

Fool am I to hear a old love song.
And wanna cry but the melody keeps haunting me 
reminding me how in love we used to be.
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our heart saying together forever.

ev'rytime I hear our favorite song, now you're gone, left this emptiness, 
I only reminisce.

make romance to the music,

Chase it right down to the finish line

would you want me down

Until they find me lying cold
and they check my blood for just a trace of you

How good would it feel, you could say you had me
You could say you had me and I was yours
How good would it feel if I needed your potion so badly
Until you captured my mind with the single desire for more

And yes I desire you
of course I desire you
but how good could it feel
To lead me to my fall

and if you respect me at all
Please don't call.

David Wilcox,"You say you see no hope
You say you see no reason we should dream
That the world would ever change
You say the love is foolish to believe
'Cause they'll always be some crazy
With an army or a knife
To wake you from your daydream
Put the fear back in your life

Look
If someone wrote a play
To just to glorify what's stronger than hate
Would they not arrange the stage
To look as if the hero came too late?
He's almost in defeat
It's looking like the evil side will when
So on the edge of every seat
From the moment that the whole thing begins

It is love who mixed the mortar
And it's love who stacked these stones
And it's love who made the stage here
Although it looks like we're alone
In this scene, set in shadows,
Like the night is here to stay
There is evil cast around us
But it's love that wrote the play
For in this darkness love can show the way

Now the stage is set
You can feel your own heart beating in your chest
This life's not over yet
So we get up on our feet and do our best
We play against the fear
We play against the reasons not to try
We're playing for the tears
Burning in the happy angel's eyes

For it's love who mixed the mortar
And it's love who stacked these stones
And it's love who made the stage here
Though it looks like we're alone
In this scene, set in shadows,
Like the night is here to stay
There is evil cast around us
But it's love that wrote the play
For in this darkness love will show the way",Show the Way
David Wilcox,"The depth of your dreams
The height of your wishes
The length of your vision to see
The hope of your heart is much bigger than this
For it's made out of what might be

Now picture your hope, your heart's desire,
As a castle that you must keep
In all of its splendor, it's drafty with lonely
This heart is too hard to heat

When I get lonely, that's only a sign
Some room is empty, but that room is there by design
If I feel hollow, that's just my proof that there's more
For me to follow
That's what the lonely is for

Is it a curse or a blessing, this palace of promise
When the empty chill makes you weep?
With only the thin fire of romance to warm you
These halls are too tall and deep

When I get lonely, that's only a sign
Some room is empty, but that room is there by design
If I feel hollow, that's just my proof that there's more
For me to follow
That's what the lonely is for

You can seal up the pain, build walls in the hallways
Close off a small room to live in
But those walls remain, and keep you there always
And you'll never know why you were given
Why you were given the lonely

Some room is empty...
If you feel hollow, that's just your proof there's more you need to follow

The depth of your dreams
The height of your wishes
The length of your vision to see
The hope of your heart is much bigger than this
For it's made out of what might be

When I get lonely, that's only a sign
Some room is empty, but that room is there by design
If I feel hollow, that's just my proof that there's more
For me to follow

When I get lonely...
Some room is empty...
If I feel hollow, that's just my proof that there's more for me to follow
That's what the lonely is for

David Wilcox,"Here I go, singing this song again. I got a letter about this song. ""David, I came to your concert etc. etc. looking forward to etc. etc. We were very disappointed we had to leave your concert because you had to play that song about SEX."" I don't know why I have to sings songs about sex. I mean, they like when I sing songs about what I believe...I just believe that sex is pretty nice.

After your orgasm
The world is a different place
The world is a different place
(Bear with me, now)
After your orgasm, when you slide out of bed
You stay slippery
You stay slippery
So the worries in our head
Slide away, slide away

The world will change it's angle
So the furniture will slide slowly
To one side of the room
For gravity is different now
As everything must fall
As we rise, surprising

Oh, we must slide into each other
And let this air that knows us, in
It's harder to breathe out
Fast as we are filled
And as the room turns, I will brace you
As you bravely give your all
To the moon-soaked wall...and wind

The air inside this room is yours and mine
It's been inside our breathing
When you reached inside my ribcage
And put both your hands around my spine
You realized my feeling

Oh, we must slide into each other
And let this air that knows us, in
It's harder to breathe out
Fast as we are filled
And as the room turns, I will brace you
As you bravely give your all
To the moon-soaked wall, and wind

David Wilcox,"She had some extra money
She wanted to buy time
Her friends said it was dangerous
But they couldn't change her mind

She did if for her mirror
And for the ocean's summer sand
She just laid down to that scalpel
That was in the surgeon's hand

She got a boob job
She got a what?
A boob job, no, yeah?
Put a pad of silicone up against the breastbone
Treat her like a man made thing

Well, the surgeons try to tell you
That the world will love you better
If you let 'em cut your body
And make those mounds inside your sweater

Just think of the investment
Now how long those things will last?
You know like, silicone is permanent
Even after you have passed

When the rest of you has faded
In some box under some stone
Yeah, you'll still have your silicone
Balanced on your bones

David Wilcox,"Go easy on those eyes
I'm about to lose my grip
Go easy on that smile
I'm afraid that I might slip

Lay off on that calling
And tempting me to try
'Cause I'm so scared of falling
I'll never learn to fly

Then you say,
Touch me you can reach me
Ah, you can make me want to fly
You make it seem so easy

Catch me if I try
Tempting me to step off of the edge of reason
I thought that I knew better than to start believing
In Love, Love, Love

And if I read you right
We just might want to dance all night
And I have risked a fall before

When you say
Touch me you can reach me

Will be your only guide

Look at the word, spell it, see-old
See-old, you're pulled over by the reaper for a warning

He says,""I clocked you thinking 80
You know you're not that old
You've been worried about the darkness in the morning""

""Well, I'll give you something to worry about"", he says
Flips open his ticket pad, appreciates your breathing

I'm gonna write you up a headache for those thoughts
Now why you been so worried, man? What have you been reading?
And why do you have to tally all you've lost?

I'ma write you up a head cold, it comes on like bad weather
So maybe you'll appreciate the warming
See, it gives a new perspective, soon you'll be feeling better

I'll let you off this time with a warning

David Wilcox,"I'm dangerously romantic
When the leaves are coming down
When the air was clear this morning
And the frost still on the ground
When I wore those cozy woolen gloves
To bicycle into town
Well, of course I want to fall in love
And finally settle down

But I'm dangerous
Be careful with me
I could fall for you
Much too easily
I'm usually cool
I like to be free
But I'm dangerous right now
Be careful with me

I'm hopelessly sentimental
When the winter comes a storm
And the snow is on the mailbox
And the sidewalks all are gone
But the fire in the wood stove
Will keep me so nice and warm
That of course I'd want to live with you
And share this simple home

Guess I'm dangerous
Be careful with me
Cause I could fall for you
Much too easily

But I'm dangerous right now

When the spring is in the air
And I'm acting like a child again

But I found these purple flowers
To weave into your hair
And of course I'd want to marry you
And travel off somewhere

David Wilcox,"Somewhere deep in the Midwest
There's a middle aged man in a mid-size car
Driving down the middle of the road
In the middle of the night

He's in the middle of his mid-life crisis
And he just decides that he can't go home

So he turns the car around and he drives to the airport
He flies to New York City where he makes connections for London
Where he makes connections for India
Where he gets on a train to go to the mountain

To see the wise man
You know the one
The one with the answer for that hole in his heart

Well anyway, he climbs the mountain
And he sees the wise man come out of the village to greet him
He's no dummy, he knows he was coming
And he musters up all his fear and anguish
And he says

Help me shake this nightmare
The funk has found my heart
I need to move my spirit
But I don't know where to start

I need to fill this empty
But I can't find the missing part
I'm just down inside myself

And the wise man says, ""Ah, I used to think
The blues were strong because they're true
And when they come to get you, there's nothing you can do
But now I think that's nonsense and I've got news for you
You're just down inside yourself""

There's times when you've been hopeful
And times when you were strong
Now you say that's foolish
Like your happiness was wrong

It's like you've never seen the sunshine
When a gray sky comes along
You're just down inside yourself

And the middle-aged man, he'd heard some, you know
But he had some questions
And he was just about to speak
When he was interrupted again

Well, never mind the questions now
You don't have to be so wise
Hey, your problem ain't philosophy
So get it down to size

Right now it's physiological
In a logical disguise
You're just down inside yourself

But the blues is not your final judgment
It's no deep or evil power
Hey, the cure is very simple
And it works in half an hour

Get some sleep, eat some broccoli
Run a mile, take a shower
You're just down inside yourself
You're just down inside yourself
",Down Inside Yourself
David Wilcox,"An angel appeared in a holy vision
Stood by my bedside in shivering light
Spoke my name, told me my mission
I could not believe I was hearing him right

'Cause he said, ""Go, my son, go, always go to
East Asheville Hardware before you go to Lowe's"", he said
""Go to East Asheville Hardware before you go to Lowe's""

""You'll help to keep them open, I'm worried they might close
From the stiff competition from the National Conglomerate
With the full page ad in the color section of the Sunday paper supplement
And stacks of plastic swimming pools and seven brands of power tools
And rows and rows of registers, all having nice days""

""But no, you go"", he said to me with light around his face
He said, ""You go first to that age-old place
To that old wooden door that you have to close behind you
To the wide-board wooden floor, worn down soft""

""To the real thing, a good advice, quality at the fair price
And know that they know how deep the frost goes here
I'm sure there's stuff you'll have to find at Paty's, Lowe's or Sears""

""But go to East Asheville Hardware
Go to East Asheville Hardware before it disappears""

David Wilcox,"Fearless love, fearless love
Fearless love makes you cross the border

At your church they asked for volunteers
To make a presence in the park
That's where the wicked planned to demonstrate
And carry signs to set a spark

Someone behind you heaved a stone
That struck the thin man behind his ear
So now there's blood upon his sign
Which read, ""There's nothing here to fear""

""The wrath of God,"" somebody yelled
""Will punish all of those like him
But if you travel back 2000 years
I swear you'd hear this all again""

Back then they'd say
""These soldiers walk on sacred ground
This land's our history and our home
They have no right to be around
They are the evil force of Rome""

So just how strong this change of heart must be
That one that Jesus once described
Kindness to your enemy
Carry his pack an extra mile

When fearless love, fearless love
Fearless love makes you cross the border

Your mind snaps back to where you stand
Your church is here to fight a cause
And at your feet a fallen man
Whose head is cradled in his arms

Though his blood contains his death
And though the lines are drawn in hate
You drop your sign of Bible verse
And help the wounded stand up straight

When fearless love, fearless love
Fearless love makes you cross the border

Oh yes, the high religious still will scorn
Just like they did all that time back
They'll say, you helped the other side
They saw you haul that soldier's pack

But now how could you carry that man's sign?
In your heart the choice was clear
You didn't join the other side
The battle lines just disappeared

When fearless love, fearless love
Fearless love makes you cross the border
",Fearless Love
David Wilcox,"Was golden day November, a one long year ago
I came to stay the holiday into your mountain home
I came to share your friendship and sing those fireside songs
I'd like to say I'm sorry for what the year has done

I told you of a distant love I did not know so well
I could not say I loved her but surely time would tell
But you and I together and her so far away
Our love that night by firelight, we did not have to say

So time will tell a story and time will tell a lie
I never said I'm sorry, I never said goodbye
The love for you was in me, the tear was in your eye
The silence grew around the wound that tore your heart and mine

So now the year is cold again and memory is warm
I came to stay the holiday just one long year ago
I think about your kindness and what the time has done
It's time I said I'm sorry and thank you for your love
",Golden Day
