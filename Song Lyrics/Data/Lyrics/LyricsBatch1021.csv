Merl Saunders,"Virgil Caine is the name, and I served on the Danville train
'Til Stoneman's cavalry came and it tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive
By May tenth, Richmond had fell, it's a time I remember, oh so well

The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and all the bells were ringing
The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and all the people were singin'
They went

Back with my wife in Tennessee, when one day she called to me
""Say Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E. Lee!""
Now I don't mind choppin' wood, and I don't care if my money's no good
Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best

The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and all the bells were ringing
The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and all the people were singin'
They went

Like my father before me, I will work the land
And like my brother up above me, who took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave, but a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet, you can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat

The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, when all the bells were ringing
The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and you could hear 'm all singin'
They went",The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down

Fine calypso woman, 
She cook me shrimp and rice, 
Fine calypso woman, 
She cook me shrimp and rice
Dese yankee hot dogs 
Don't treat me stomach very nice.

In Trinidad, one dollar buy 
Papaya juice, banana pie, 
Six coconut, one female goat, 
An' plenty fish to fill de boat. 
One bushel bread, one barrel wine, 
An' all de town, she come to dine. 

But here is bad, one dollar buy 
Cup of coffee, ham on rye. 
Me throat she sick from necktie, 
Me feet hurt from shoes. 
Me pocket full of empty, 
I got Calypso blues.

Dese yankee girl give me big scare, 
Is black de root, is blonde de hair. 
Her eyelash false, her face is paint, 
And pads are where de girl she ain't

She jitterbug when she should waltz, 
I even think her name is false. 
But calypso girl is good a lot, 
Is what you see, is what she got.

Merl Saunders,"I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I was hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her""
Yah! Hey, hey, hey
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah!
Ah, I was made to love her
Built my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey
Oo baby, I was made to please her
You know Stevie ain't gonna leave her, no
Hey, hey, hey
Oo wee baby, my baby loves me
My baby needs me
Hey, hey, hey
Oo my baby loves me",I Was Made to Love Her [Live]

Sitting here in limbo, like a bird without a song
Well they're putting up resistance
But I know my faith will lead me on

Sitting here in limbo, got some time to search my soul
Well they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

I don't know where life will lead me
But I know where I've been
I can't say what life will show me
But I know what I've seen
Tried my hand at love and friendship

Merl Saunders,"I could give up my friends I know
And in return you could give up yours

Before we think, what would we do later on?
What kind of life would we have
Just in case we both were wrong?

I give up my woman you give your man
But it don't make sense to take the chance

Before we think, what would we do later on?
What kind of life would we have
Just in case we both were wrong?

Well love is a gamble, we know that's true
Why gamble on me? Why should I on you?

Before we think, what would we do later on?
What kind of life would we have
Just in case we both were wrong?",Think

Tough Mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?

Dark Beauty, Won't you move it on over and make some room?
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
You came through it all the way, flyin' through the skies.
Dark Beauty With that long night's journey in your eyes.

Sweet Goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you've been.
Jack the Cowboy went up north He's buried in your past.
The Lone Wolf went out drinking That was over pretty fast.
Sweet Goddess Your perfect stranger's comin' in at last.

Silver Angel, with the badge of the lonesome road sewed in your sleeve,
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you would receive. Today on the
Countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch, I stood alone upon the ridge
And all I did was watch. Sweet Goddess It must be time to carve another
Notch.

I'm crestfallen, the world of illusion is at my door,
I ain't haulin' any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
The prison walls are crumblin', there is no end in sight,
I've gained some recognition but I lost my appetite.
Dark Beauty Meet me at the border late tonight.

Merl Saunders,"Maybe you'll wanna give me kisses sweet
But only for one night with no repeat.
And maybe you'll go away and never call,
And a taste of honey is worse that none at all.
Oh little girl!

In that case I don't want nobody
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion,
I second that emotion.
So, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion.

Maybe you'll think that love will tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around.
Or maybe you'll think that love will make us fools,
And so it makes you wise to break the rules.
Oh little girl!

In that case I don't want nobody
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion,
I second that emotion.
So, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion.

In that case I don't want nobody

Merle Evans,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Down by the old country school I went to as a child
Two miles down a gravel road I could see the proud old home

The roots of my rasing run deep I come back for the strength that I need
And hope comes no matter how far down I sink the roots of my raising run deep

I pulled into the driveway Lord it sure was good to be there
And I could see that dad was asleep in his favorite chair
In his hand was a picture of mom and I remembered how close they were
So I just turned away I didn't want to wake him spoil his dreams of her

A christian mom who had the strength for life the way she did
Then to pull that apron off and do the Charleston for us kids

He raised a weak and weary hand to brush away the cold

Outside the rain was falling on that lonely boxcar door

Merle Haggard,"I have often dreamed of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be

I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile will be worth my while
When I go the distance I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though the road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It may take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no, I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope but I won't lose hope
Till I go the distance and my journey is complete

But to look beyond the glory
Is the hardest part
For a hero's strength
Is measured by his heart

Like a shooting star I can go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far I can go the distance
Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms

I will search the world
I will face its harms
Till I find my hero's welcome
Waiting in your arms

Tired of the glamor and tired of the sights
In all my dreams I am roaming once more
Back to my home on that old river shore

I am sad and weary far away from home

Days are dark and dreary and everywhere I roam
Miss the Mississippi and you

Roaming the wide world over
Always alone and blue, so blue
Nothing seems to cheer me under heaven's dome

Good morning, Shine
Do you need another mule skinner
Out on your new mud line?

I can carve my initials
On a mule's behind

Hey, little water boy
Bring that water round
If you don't like your job
Set that water bucket down

Walking on the good roads
Dollar and half a day
My good gal's waiting on Saturday night
Just to draw my pay

I'm going to town, honey
What you want me to bring you back?
Bring a pint of booze
And a Johny be Stetson hat

I smell your bread a burning
Turn your damper down
If you ain't got a damper
Good gal, turn your bread around

Moon moon I can see you sinking low
You make me think of a sweetheart a little girl that I love so
After I wonder the whole night through wondering if you think of me
Why am I lonesome thinking of someone I'm thinking only of you
My Carolina sunshine girl you have turned my heart to stone
My Carolina sunshine girl you have left me all alone
I wonder why I sit and cry
When I really should laugh at your photograph
For you're the sweetest angel in this world
And I love love love you my Carolina sunshine girl

And wishing that you were here
I'm dreaming of the times and the days gone by
When you filled my heart with cheer

I remember the nights when all alone
We sang Sweet Adeline
No other face can take your place
In my heart old pal of mine

The old pals are always the best you see
New friends you can find every day
But they can't fill their places or ever be
Like the old pals of yesterday

I'm wondering where you are tonight
And if you ever think of me
It would make my weary heart
So light sweetheart your face again to see

But in my checkered life I find
Nothing comes right it seems
Still you'll always be a pal of mine
Though it may be only in dreams

When a woman gets the blues she hangs her little head and cries
When a woman gets the blues she hangs her little head and cries
But when a man gets the blues he grabs a train and rides
Every time I see that lonesome railroad train
Every time I see that lonesome railroad train
It makes me wish I was going home again
Looky yonder coming coming down that railroad track
Looky yonder coming coming down that railroad track
With the black smoke rolling rolling from that old smoke stack
I got the blues so bad till the whole round world looks blue
I got the blues so bad till the whole round world looks blue
I ain't got a dime I don't know what to do
I'm weary now I want to leave this town
I'm weary now and I want to leave this town
I can't find a job I'm tired of hanging around

Oh the moon light's so bright makes me lonely tonight
Everything seems to make me feel blue here
I'm down hearted now I'm lonesome somehow
Cause you are proving untrue
Why should I be so lonely why should I be sad
Though another is taking from me the best pal I've ever had
She's taking the sunshine with her leaving the clouds for me
But why should I be so lonesome when there's nobody lonesome for me
Oh the violets so blue are calling for roses so sweet make me lonely
They bring to my mind a sweet happy time when your love was only for me
Why should I be so lonely...

Merle Haggard,"My driftin' memory goes back to the spring of '43 
When I was just a child in momma's arms
My daddy plowed the ground and promised someday we would leave 
This run-down mortgaged Oklahoma farm
Then one night I heard my daddy sayin' to my momma
That he'd finally saved enough to go
California was his dream, a paradise, for he had seen
Pictures in magazines that told him so

California cotton fields 
Where labor camps were filled with weary men with broken dreams
California cotton fields 
As close to wealth as daddy ever came

Nearly everything we had was sold or left behind
From my daddy's plow to the soup that momma canned
Some folks came to say farewell or see what all we had to sell
Some just came to shake my daddy's hand
That model A was loaded down and California bound
A change of luck was just four days away
But the only change that I remember seeing in my daddy
Was when his dark hair turned to silver grey

Each page is torn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table
Will ever be my key to memories
At the end of day when work was over
And when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings, one by one

I can see us sitting round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of ages
Rock of ages cleft for me

Now this old world
Of ours is full of trouble
And this old world would also better be
If we'd found more Bibles on the tables
And mothers singing rock of ages, cleft for me

When from the family Bible dad would read

With an engineer that's brave

Into which your train will drive

There you'll meet the Superintendent

Towards the bad, I kept turning

No one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading, I denied

Left my Mom a heavy load,

And he was born in that rundown shack
Before there was a town

He bought that shack and a piece of earth
For the highest price to pay
His mom was bought and sold there
Uncle Lem was born'd a slave

The mayor and some ladies of the garden club
Went out to tell Uncle Lem that he'd have to find a new place to live
Well, they found him there in that old broken down rockin' chair
And on an old paper bag they found his will

""Nor I wanna leave my old shotgun to the fine mayor of this town
For I remember when he a little fella, he used to follow me around
I wish I had more to give to my friends that I love
But all I've got is this old shack and a piece of earth
And I want it to go to the ladies of the garden club""

I cannot offer you clothes that your young body craves

He didn't come home from work and he went away

There they say he met with some women dressed in yellow and scarlet
Their warm lips like a honeycomb, dripped with honey
And somethin' about the smell of strange perfume
Made him feel warm, and not alone

When I was just a baby my mama told me ""Son
Always be a good boy don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that lonesome whistle I hang my head and I cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars
Well, I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free
But I hear that train a-rollin' and that's what tortures me

So I'll just check for things once more and look in every room
I must have dropped my comb somewhere
And a man must stay well groomed
It seems I have the right to stay but I know you don't agree
When it's goodbye to all our love, goodbye comes hard for me

Goodbye comes hard for me and I hoped you'd grab my sleeve
I thought that you might change your mind and ask me not to leave

Merle Haggard,"Oh, the path was deep and wide from footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door, there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock and there would stand a stranger
Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp

The corn was dry and the weeds were high when Daddy took to drinking
Him and Lucy Walker, they took up and ran away
Mama cried a tear and then she promised fourteen children
I swear you'll never see a hungry day

When Mama sacrificed her pride, the neighbors started talkin'
But I was much too young to understand the things they said
The thing that mattered most of all was Mama's chicken dumplings
And a goodnight kiss before we went to bed

Oh, the path was deep and wide from footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock and there would stand a stranger
Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp

When Daddy left then destitution came upon our family
Not one neighbor volunteered to give a helping hand
So let them gossip all they want, she loved us and she raised us
The truth is standing here, the full grown man

Last summer Mama passed away and left the ones who loved her
Each and every one is more than grateful for their birth
Each Sunday she receives the fresh bouquet of fourteen roses
And a card that reads, 'The greatest Mom on earth'

Oh, the path was deep and wide from footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp

Put a slouch hat down low on my ears
I'm yearning to leave this old town 
On the flight and loose all my troubles and cares
In this day of airplanes and highways 
Hey the slow way is sometimes the best
I'm longing to ride on a freight train 
And be a good old American guest
Yes I want to live on the land that 
I've loved and I've labored for
And spend a few days headed west
I'm longing to ride on a freight train 
And be a good old American guest

Well the pressures of life they got to me 
And they got down and deep in my soul
I'm tired of the rat-race 
want to go back to the slow pace
And hear a fast train rattle and roll
I want to live out my days like a hobo 
And take myself that long-needed rest

Yes I want to live on the land that 
I've loved and I've labored for

I thought I would surely lose my mind
Everyday of life was just another day gone by

Hey dyin' ain't on my list of things to do
I think I'm gonna live forever 
Hey it feels so good 
Just to be out of love with you

Hey, babe, you left me hanging 
Just trying to aggravate me all the way
And you got it done just the way you always do

Merle Haggard,"I pulled into Memphis thirteen minutes early first time in two weeks
There's where she came to meet me as I stepped down off of 51 and needed sleep
And the baby's overdue I know you need some things
But the more that we discuss it it's the same
Long train rolling got a feeling and I'm knowing she's not waiting for me
These rails keep getting longer and this feeling's getting stronger she won't let me be
I love my woman fire and rain but I won't give up my train
Baby came in April while I was in Chicago in the pouring rain
Black car and rusty tanker three boxcars and an empty sack of mail
And though I get lonely sometimes I know there's just no other way to explain

I'm tired of going round and round
I've played the game of love and lost

'Cause you no longer care for me
I miss the wonder of your kiss
Why did you leave me here like this?

Hey, stop the world and let me off

I know your love for me has died

Merle Haggard,"I get this going fever everytime I hear a tune
That talks about South Texas where the cactus is in bloom
I feel I oughta be there every evening after dark
To hear the fiddler fiddlin' around a tune called Old Joe Clark

We played that show in Tulsa then it was Ft Worth bound
We headed south on 35 to that South Texas town
It's a different world and a lot of fun if you like that country sound
You can find yourself a partner when they boil that cabbage down

If you're ever down in Texas and feeling all alone
There's a lot of kicker places just south of San Antone
Ain't nothin' fancy mind ya just a place where good folks go
You can hear the bootheels start to click when they play the Cotton Eyed Joe",Texas Fiddle Song
Merle Haggard,"Sometimes songs are done by singers that don't mean them
And at times I've done the same and couldn't sing them
At times I've written songs about some things I didn't do
But these are my words and mine alone these words are true
I've written words in many ways to make them rhyme
And at times I've stolen notes that wadn't mine
Sometimes I changed my style all around to make it new
These are my words and this is my way and it's for you
'Cause I love you with all of my heart my soul and my mind
These are my words those notes are mine this song is mine

Merle Haggard,"Now it's back to the barrooms
Right back to drinkin' again
Someday you'll love me enough to stay with me
And whiskey won't be my best friend
But now it's back to the barrooms again

The bartender knows me, he knows how you do me
And he knows why I'm back here again
He should be given a prize for his patience
'Cause bartenders do understand
So it's back to the barrooms again

With the loud music roaring and the bartender pouring
And my shaky legs trying to stand
It's over and over I've tried to stay sober
But look what a failure I've been
And so it's back to the barrooms again

Oh yes it's back to the barrooms

Merle Haggard,"Memories and drinks don't mix too well
Jukebox records don't play those wedding bells.
Looking at the world through the bottom of a glass
All I see is a man who's fading fast.
Tonight I need that woman again
What I'd give for my baby to just walk in.
Sit down beside me and say its alright
Take me home and make sweet love to me tonight.

[Chorus]
But here I am again mixing misery and gin
Sitting with all my friends and talking to myself.
I look like I'm having a good time but any fool can tell
That this honky tonk heaven really makes you feel, like hell.

I light a lonely woman's cigarette
We start talking about what we wanna forget.
Her life story and mine are the same
We both lost someone and only have ourselves to blame.

Like me your feeling lost
Maybe right now we both need each other
But our paths may never cross
People like us never find each other
Love is our greatest loss
Baby I know you are out there some where
But our paths may never cross
We're to people that should be together
Cause we're lonely at the very same time
But there's a million to many good reasons
Why your love can never be mine

And come sing it with me

There's a bright and a sunny side too
Though we meet with the darkness and the strife
The sunny side we also have in view

So keep on the sunny side
Always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help you everyday
It will brighten all the way
If you'll keep on the sunny side of life

Oh the storm in its fury broke today
Crushing hopes that I cherish so dear
But clouds and storms will soon pass away
And the sun again will shine bright and clear

So keep on the sunny side...

Let us greet, with a song of hope, each day
Though the moments be cloudy or fair
Let us trust that our Saviour always
Will keep us, everyone, in his care

So keep on the sunny side...

Don't seem like we've been settled down since we got out of school

And you made me believe in you and that you wanted me

If love causes this much pain and revenge really played no part

And if you're fighting with love you have no way to win

So helpless and appealing

With one passin' glance I could tell she was young for her age

When Leonard finally came to California
He was twenty-one years old, as I recall
He loved to write a song and pick on the guitar
And he came to hang a gold one on the wall

The town in which he lived is not important
But you'll know which town I mean by the time I'm through
He soon became a famous entertainer
But Leonard was a name he never used

He was on his way to having what he wanted
Just about as close as one could be
Hey, once he even followed Elvis Presley
And he wrote a lot of country songs for me

But he laid it all aside to follow Jesus
For years he chose to let his music go
But preaching wasn't really meant for Leonard
But how in the hell was Leonard s'posed to know

Well, life began to twist it's way around him
And I wondered how he carried such a load
He came back again to try his luck in music
And lost his wife and family on the road

After that he seemed to bog down even deeper
And I saw what booze and pills could really do
And I wondered if I'd ever see him sober
But I forgot about a friend that Leonard knew

Well, Leonard gave me lots of inspiration
He helped teach me how to write a country song
And he even brought around a bag of groceries
Hey, back before Muskogee came along

Really, I'm not trying to hide his show name
Or the town in which this episode began

Somehow I had to write a song for old Tommy
If just to see the smilin' faces in the band

I wish I knew which way to turn and go
I feel so good and then, then I feel so bad
I wonder what I ought to do

If I could only fly, if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand and I got no where to run
Another sinking sun and one more lonely night

The wind keeps blowing, somewhere, everyday
Tell me things get better, somewhere, up the way
Just dismal thinking on a dismal day
And sad songs for us to bare

If I could only fly
If we could only fly
If we could only fly
There'd be no more lonely nights

You know, sometimes, I write happy songs
Then some little thing goes wrong
I wish they all could make you smile

Coming home soon and I wanna stay
Maybe we can, somehow, get away
I wish you could come with me when I go again

Merle Haggard,"We left out of Tucson with no destination in mind
We were runnin' from trouble and the jail-term the Judge had in mind
And the border meant freedom, a new life and romance
And that's why we thought we should go
And start our lives over on the seashores of old Mexico

Our first night in Juarez, we lost all the money we had
One bad senorita made use of two innocent lad
But we must keep on runnin' it's too late to turn back
And we wanted in Tucson, we know
An' things'll blow over on the seashores of old Mexico

Two Mexican farmers en route to a town, I can't say
Let us ride on the back of a flatbed half-loaded with hay
Down through Durango, Colima, Almiera
Then in the Manzanillos
Where we slept in the sunshine on the seashores of old Mexico

After one long siesta, we came wide awake in the night
We were startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight
Our new-found companion, one young Senorita
Who offered a broken hello
To the gringo she found on the seashores of old Mexico

She spoke of Sonora and swore that she'd never return
For her Mexican husband, she really had no great concern
'Cause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo
Well that's all I needed to know
We found what we needed on the seashores of old Mexico

And the pistol rode west with the sun

Speed of their guns were the same
From dark city Kansas to wild Arizon
All outlaws alike knew their name

A shotgun, a pistol, known the world over as
The two biggest guns in the west
But the whole town of Tombstone knew the friendship was shakin'
And they wondered which one was the best

Only a shootout could settle the question
That lay heavy on everyone's mind
Whiskey and loose talk and their love for a woman
Made the shoot out a matter of time

That lived up to it's blood-thirsty name

Some said the town was to blame

Changed history and canceled the game

I used to play till the evening sun would come
Then winding down that old familiar pathway 
I heard my mother call at set of sun
""Come home, come home it's suppertime 
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home it's suppertime 
We're going home at last""

Some of my fondest memories of my childhood 
Are woven around suppertime
When my mother used to call from the backsteps 
Of the old homeplace
She said ""come home, son, it's suppertime"" 
Oh what I'd give to hear that one more time
But you know time has woven a realization 
Of truth that is even more thrilling
And that's when we get that call from the 
Greatest glory to come home on suppertime
When all of God's children gather around 
The table with the love of himself
And we'll celebrate the greatest suppertime of all
Come home, come home",Suppertime

My good gal's trying to make a fool out of me
Lord my gal's trying to make a fool out of me
Trying to make me believe I ain't got that old TB
I've got the TB blues
When it rained down sorrow it rained all over me
When it rained down sorrow it rained all over me
Cause my body rattles like a train on that old SP
I've got the TB blues
I've got that old TB I can't eat a bite
Got that old TB I can't eat a bite
Got me worried soul I can't even sleep at night
I've got the TB blues
I've been fightin' like a lion looks like I'm going to lose
I've been fightin' like a lion looks like I'm going to lose
Cause there ain't nobody ever with the TB blues
I've got the TB blues
Gee but that graveyard is a lonesome place
Lord but that graveyard is a lonesome place
They put you on your back throw that mud down in your face
I've got the TB blues

Merle Haggard,"If he ever gets to you
I know he'll ignite the flame
And it hurts to know
How close he really came

Last night you both kept dancing
When the music ceased to play
Is it all over? Do you still love me
Or am I standing in your way?

Tell me the way feel
I've got to know
Should I stay and keep trying
Or should I go?

Last night he almost made it
He's still on your mind today
Is it all over do you still love me
Or am I standing in your way?

Tell me the way feel

The night is still early here in Frisco
Market street's still going the same old shows are showing
And I'm still all alone here in Frisco

They say it's raining in Chicago and it's cold and clear in Denver
Been windy all night long here in Frisco
Troley cars are clinging the big Bay Town's swinging
And I'm still all alone here in Frisco

The way I feel tonight I won't be staying long
But when I leave I leave my heart just like in a famous song

Merle Haggard,"Sixty-six was still a narrow two-lane highway
Harry Truman was the man who ran the show
The bad Korean war was just beginning
And I was just three years too young to go
Country Music hadn't gone to New York City yet
And a service man was proud of what he'd done
Hank and Lefty crowded ev'ry jukebox
That's the way it was in fifty one.

There's so much about the good old days I'd love to tell
And there's folks around I know still remember well
Slow dancin' close together when a ballad played
'Cause a thing called Rock and Roll was yet to come
It was a big year for a drive-in rest'rant car hop

Merle Haggard,"I remember it all started in 1929 when me and Diana came to Alaska
To homestead some of this free government land
Forty mile from the nearest gravel road we cut our life in the ponderosa pines
We sweated hard to beat the winter snow
But the cabin's up and we've got lots of times
What have you got planned tonight Diana would you consider laying in my arms
I love you more than ever now Diana I'm sure you're the reason I was born
Jim was born the first year we were here look at him my God he's almost grown
The baby's in the cradle fast asleep just think in no time he'll be up and gone
What have you got planned tonight Diana...
The time sure does fly doesn't it Dianna
It's been almost two years now since since you've been gone

Just another breath or two and I'll be home by the way
What have you got planned tonight Diana...",What Have You Got Planned Tonight Diana
Merle Haggard,"Tonight there'll be candlelight and roses
In this little country chapel that's almost falling down
There'll be tears in this old farmer's eyes this evening
When I give my one possession to that city boy from town

His hair is a little longer than we're use to
But, I guess I should find something good to say
About this man whose won the farmer's daughter
And will soon become my son-in-law today

Mama left eight years ago December
And it was hard to be a Dad and Mama too
But, somehow we made home of this old farmhouse
And love was all my baby ever knew

He could be the richest man in seven counties
And not be good enough to take her hand
But, he says he really loves the farmer's daughter
And I know the farmer's daughter loves the man",The Farmer's Daughter

So I can't be myself, when I'm with you

Oh, you never liked the clothes I wear on Sunday
Just because I don't believe the way you do

I'm just talkin' to myself man-to-man
This ol' mental fat I'm chewin' didn't take a lotta doin'
But I take a lot of pride in what I am

I guess I grew up a loner
I don't remember ever havin' any folks around
But I keep thumbin' through the phonebooks
And looking for my daddy's name in every town

And I meet lots of friendly people

While Mama used to pray my crops would fail

I'd like to settle down but they won't let me

Now she waits by the phone, she waits there all alone

We built our love to last like old Henry Ford builds cars
Not one that falls apart after once around the block
Our love is solid as a rock

Through the years we've learned, good things don't come easy
And life's a little crazy and nothin's ever free
All the tears and turns, ain't no bed of roses
But we're about as close as two hearts could ever be

Our love is solid as a rock like the moon and stars
We built our love to last like old Henry Ford builds cars
Not one that falls apart after once around the block
Our love is solid as a rock

Our love is solid as a rock not once around the block
With sound 'round the clock and solid as a rock

With sound 'round the clock and solid as a rock",Solid as a Rock

I'm all through ever trusting anyone

The only thing I can count on now is my fingers
I was a fool believing in you and now you are gone
It amazes me, not knowing any better

Than to think I had a love who would be true
Why, I should be taken out, tarred and feathered
To have let myself be taken in by you

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away

Merle Haggard,"A canvas-covered cabin in a crowded labour camp 
Stand out in this memory I revived
'Cause my daddy raised a family there, with two hard-working hands 
And tried to feed my mama's hungry eyes

He dreamed of something better, and my mama's faith was strong
And us kids were just to young to realize
That another class of people put us somewhere just below

Mama never had the luxuries she wanted 
But it wasn't 'cause my daddy didn't try
She only wanted things she really needed

But I don't recall a change of any size
Just a little loss of courage, as their age began to show
And more sadness in my mama's hungry eyes

And it's much too big a thing for mortal man
Just take a look around and see the writing on the wall
Somehow we've got to find a helping hand

And people scorn the things our leaders do
It's time a prayer was spoken from the heart of every man
Jesus, take a hold and lead us through

The mighty roar of gunfire is now a local sound
And our city streets are filled with angry men
Law's now a mockery throughout our troubled land
And destruction seems to be the current trend

Merle Haggard,"Here the labor is so hard and the workers they are tired
And our weary hearts're yearning for a rest
And I find we're getting anxious to be in that happy home
Where we'll receive such peace and happiness

But wait a little longer please Jesus there are so many wandering out in sin
Just a little longer please Jesus a few more days to get our loved ones in

Family scattered here and there and thought Lord we love them dear
Maybe we can help them find a way
But if waiting is the cost dear ol' Lord then I'll be lost
And that's the only reason why we say

Wait a little longer please Jesus
A few more days to get our loved ones in",Wait a Little Longer Please Jesus

Tomorrow I'll meet darkness as death will say hello
Darling put you lips to mine and tell me that you love
Hold me close again before you go

Will you visit me on Sundays, Will you bring me pretty flowers
Will your big blue eyes be misty, will you brush brush away a tear
A grave is filled with silence, but if a sleeping man could hear
Darling, will I hear your footsteps up there.

Promise me that time won't separate me from your memory
That you will still remember me in days of silver hair
If not for you I know I'd lose my life before the morning

You'll never love me now

Merle Haggard,"Beautiful isle of somewhere

If you've got two or three minutes
I'd like to tell you a story
And this a story about a preacher
And I know there's a lot of stories about a lot of preachers

But this is a story of one particular preacher
Who went overseas to fight a war
And this was a war for God and not for any one country
And he fought a long hard fight and he won a lot of souls

But this preacher got old and he was coming home
Now he just happened to be on the same ship
With what some of us call a celebrity

And when the boat docked
There were thousands of people waiting
To meet the celebrity
And they carried him off on their shoulders

But there was no one there
To meet the old preacher
And he looked up and he said
""Lord did you forget?""

Well, it seemed like the Heavens just broke open
And the Lord said, ""No son I didn't forget
But you must remember
You're not home yet""

You're not home, you're not home
You're not home yet
I can still hear my Lord's voice ringing

""There'll be a crowd to meet you
A choir of angels to greet you
I didn't forget but son
You're not home yet""",You're Not Home Yet

Picked a little cotton and a lotta guitar in Bakersfield

Merle Haggard,"With my ears I have heard the eagle call my name
He flew in from the night to talk to me
We talked about his freedom and he spoke with great concern
He said, ""Mother earth is aging rapidly""

He said, ""The winds of change are blowing
And the land is disappearing more each day
Farewell my son, I must be going""
He turned and then forever flew away

With my eyes I have seen pretty mountain streams
Change from crystal clear to factory brown
The old bear shook his heard and through his eyes
He said, ""I guess there's no more salmon to be found""

He said, ""The winds of change are blowing""
Telling me that I can't stay
Farewell my friend, I must be going
He turned and then forever walked away

I've lived in the land where the wolf mistrusted me
He taught me that the stronger shall survive
Even in our world today, the weaker are the prey
And if we don't fight for our planet she will die

And the winds of change keep blowing
Yet we turn the other way
If we don't stop the wrong we're doing
Then mother earth will surely pass away",Winds of Change

I'll see that you don't walk.

Well I haven't got a nickel
Not a penny can I show

In that muddy water, I long to be once more
When that shadows creep about and the whippoorwill call
You can hear old mommy shout, ""Come in here, you all""

Way down on the levee, strolling in the pale moon light
You can see those steamboats and fields of snowy white
That's a feeling, I can't lose muddy water in my shoes
When I get those Mississippi Delta blues

Merle Haggard,"It's midnight at a liquor store in Texas.					 
Beneath the neon, close up's just begun. 
When a boy walks in the door and points a pistol.		 
He can't find a job, but man, he's found a gun.

But a change of heart before there's confrontation.				 
Let's the old man live and run out in the street.						 
But he knows that soon they'll come with guns a blazing.
And already he can feel a great relief.

Oh how many travlers get weary,			 
Bearing both their burdens and their scars,					 
Don't you think they'd love to stop complaining,				 
And fly like eagles out among the stars.

He pictures the arrival of the cruisers.						 
Sees that old familiar anger in their eyes. 						 
He knows that when they're shooting at this loser,					 
They'll be aiming at the deamons in their lives.

Oh how many travlers get weary,		 
Bearing both their burdens and their scars,				 
Don't you think they'd love to stop complaining,				 
And fly like eagles out among the stars.

The evening news it carries all the details.				 
He dies in every living room in town.					 
And in his home a bottle's thrown in anger.					 
And his father cries, ""We'll never live this down.""

Was gonna keep you free and clean
And now you wear your skin like iron,
And your breath as hard as kerosene

You weren't your mama's only boy,
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye,
And sank into your dreams

Pancho was a bandit boy,
His horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel

Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in Mexico,
Nobody heard his dying words,
Ah but that's the way it goes

All the Federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose

Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south
Ended up in Lefty's mouth

The day they laid poor Pancho low,
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go,
There ain't nobody knows

All the Federales say
We could have had him any day
We only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose

The poets tell how Pancho fell,
And Lefty's living in cheap hotels
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold,
And so the story ends we're told

Pancho needs your prayers it's true,
But save a few for Lefty too
He only did what he had to do,
And now he's growing old

All the Federales say
We could have had him any day
We only let him go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose

A few gray Federales say
We could have had him any day
We only let him go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose",Pancho and Lefty [Featuring Willie Nelson]

Merle Haggard,"All aboard America here comes the freedom train
All aboard America here comes the freedom train

The freedom train is rolling down two hundred years of track
Two hundred years of glory never to turn back
The train is called America your ticket is a dream
That left the torture of freedom for all the world to see
She left the station in Lexington in 1776
And rode to Philadelphia where the liberty bell was fixed
George Washington was the engineer John Adams shoveled coal
And Franklin punched the tickets Tom Jefferson added soul
All aboard America here comes the freedom train

She rode to New Orleans the battle of 1812
With old Hickory at the throttle she drove the British out
The freedom train's a fine train the toppest of world it seemed
Her whistle blows for the liberty with a mighty head of steam
Wheels of fortune sweaty Pittsburgh rolled across the Mississippi
From Texas to Missouri to one real exciting trip
Then bang of track was broken smashed by a cannonball
That blew in great divided will the nation stand or fall
All aboard America here comes the freedom train

Will Annistage stepped into the cab and the wheels began to roll
Freedom train must never stop Republic never fall
To the bloody fields of Gettysburg the tear show in his eyes
She drove the train with fury the freedom train survive
Again the train rode westward to California shores
To the deserts and prairies even stronger than before
From Atlantic to Pacific she drove the rail with pride
She traveled a track to glory with the good Lord on her side
All aboard America here comes the freedom train

There's much more to this story like Wilson and Roosevelt
They left the train to Truman who stoked it mighty well
Then old Dwight D Eisenhower or LBJ we sing
Two brothers known as Kennedy and Martin Luther King
And still the train rolls forward over history's rugged trail
Straightening by the journey and the land beneath her rail
And you and I roll along and stroke the freedom fire
For we stand to all Americans hold old honor can't be hired
All aboard America here comes the freedom train",Here Comes the Freedom Train

Sit down beside me and say its alright
Take me home and make sweet love to me tonight.

And I stood up to say good-bye like all the rest

Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die

I recall last Sunday morning a choir from 'cross the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers ""there's a song my mama sang
Could I hear once before you move along?""

Won't you sing me back home, with the song I used to hear

Merle Haggard,"

I dreamed I saw Jesus last night

seated on a mountain in the moonlight.

His hands held a key to a cabin

that cabin I'd dreamed of all my life.

Money makes the rules we have to live by.

A home is just a place they send the bills.

God knows why we work and what we pray for.

So He's building me a cabin in the hills.

Who knows He might be finished in the morning.

So I lie awake and take no sleeping pills.

God knows I'm not happy in a mansion.

So He's building me a cabin in the hills.

I live my lonesome life down in a valley with the factories, the rivers, and the mills.

Sometimes I can almost hear his hammer 'cause he's building me a cabin in the hills.

Someone has to keep the home fire burning.

So I sweat and get the harvest in the field.

Life on earth won't be the same hereafter, so he's building me a cabin in the hills.

I live my lonesome life down in a valley with the factories, the rivers and the mills.

Sometimes I can almost hear His hammer 'cause He's

building me a cabin in the hills. He's building me a cabin in the hills.

Wait just a little longer, I need some time
Make me just a little stronger, so I can climb
It's a long way up from the very bottom
To heaven's dome
And lord, I'm only halfway home

I came close to living alone
I know the kids still love me and their mama
But I came so close to losing my home

I felt small enough to drown in each teardrop
But big enough to admit I was wrong
When I think of what I've done the cheer runs through me
Cause I came so close to losing my home

If we could find a way to get inside each other's mind
If you could see me through your eyes instead of your ego

Walk a mile in my shoes, walk a mile in my shoes
And before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes.

Now your whole world you see around you is just a reflection
And the law of common says you reap just what you sow
So unless you've lived a life of total perfection
You'd better be careful of every stone that you throw.

Walk a mile in my shoes, walk a mile in my shoes
And before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes.

And yet we spend the day throwing stones at one another
'Cause I don't think or wear my hair the same way you do
Well I may be common people but I'm your brother
And when you strike out and try to hurt me its a-hurtin' you.

Walk a mile in my shoes, walk a mile in my shoes
And before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes.

There are people on reservations and out in the ghettos
And brother there but for the grace of God go you and I
If I only had the wings of a little angel
Don't you know I'd fly to the top of the mountain, and then I'd cry.

Merle Haggard,"Hobo Bill-why
Riding on that eastbound freight train speeding through the night
Hobo Bill a railroad bum was fighting for his life
The sadness of his eyes revealed the torture of his soul
He raised a weak and weary hand to brush away the cold
Hobo Bill
No warm lights flickered round him no blankets there to hold
Nothing but the howling wind and the driving rain so cold
When he heard a whistle blowing in a dreamy kind of way
The hobo seemed contented for he smiled there where he lay
Hobo Bill
Outside the rain was falling on that lonely boxcar door
But the little form of Hobo Bill lay still upon the floor
While the train sped through the darkness and the raging storm outside
No one knew that Hobo Bill was taking his last ride
It was early in the morning when they raised the hobo's head
The smile still lingered on his face but Hobo Bill was dead
There was no mother's longing to soothe his weary soul
For he was just a railroad bum who died out in the cold",Hobo Bill

Now that we have really parted, I can't believe we're through
I don't blame myself and I'm sure I can't blame you
There was something had to happen and it happened somehow
I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now

After all is said and done I'll soon forget you
Although I know that it will be so hard to do
Let things happen as they will and I'll get by somehow
I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now

Merle Haggard,"Always wanting you, but never having you
Makes it hard to face tomorrow
'Cause I know I'll wake up wanting you again
Always loving you, but never touching you
Sometimes hurts me almost more than I can stand

I'd been better off if I'd turned away
And never looked at you the second time
'Cause I really had my life all together till your eyes met mine

And there I say a yearning and a feeling 'cross the room
That you felt for me
Wish I'd had a way of knowing that the things we had in mind
Could never be

Merle Haggard,"Bonnie was a waitress in a small cafe
Clyde Barrow was the rounder that took her away
They both robbed and killed until both of them died
So goes the legend of Bonnie and Clyde

The poems that she wrote of the life that they led
Told of the lawmen left dying or dead
Some say that Clyde made her life a shame
But the legend made Bonnie the head of the game

The rampage grew wilder with each passing day
The odds growing smaller with each getaway
With the end growing closer, the harder they fought
With blood on their hands, they were bound to get caught

They drove back from town on one bright summer day
When a man they befriended stepped out in the way
With no thought of dyin' they pulled to the side
But death lay there waiting for Bonnie and Clyde

Two years or runnin' was ended that day
For robbin' and killin' they both had to pay

And us kids were just to young to realize

They're probably drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars

And we can get married tonight.

From riding the range in the cold 
He dreamed of his Hollywood sweetheart 
Her love was as lasting as gold. 

As he drew near her window 
A shadow he saw on the shade 
Was the great Philadelphia Lawyer 
Makin' love to his Hollywood maid.

The moon was bright overhead

Merle Haggard,"It's four a.m. in New York City, three a.m. in Dallas
The night is still early here in Frisco
Market street's still going, the same old shows are showing
And I'm still all alone here in Frisco

They say it's raining in Chicago, but it's cold and clear in Denver
Been windy all night long here in Frisco
Trolley cars are clinging, the big Bay Town's swinging

Merle Haggard,"We left out of Tucson with no destination in mind
We were runnin' from trouble and the jail-term the Judge had in mind
And the border meant freedom, a new life and romance
And that's why we thought we should go
And start our lives over on the seashores of old Mexico

Our first night in Juarez, we lost all the money we had
One bad senorita made use of two innocent lad
But we must keep on runnin' it's too late to turn back
And we wanted in Tucson, we know
An' things'll blow over on the seashores of old Mexico

Two Mexican farmers en route to a town, I can't say
Let us ride on the back of a flatbed half-loaded with hay
Down through Durango, Colima, Almiera
Then in the Manzanillos
Where we slept in the sunshine on the seashores of old Mexico

After one long siesta, we came wide awake in the night
We were startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight
Our new-found companion, one young Senorita
Who offered a broken hello
To the gringo she found on the seashores of old Mexico

She spoke of Sonora and swore that she'd never return
For her Mexican husband, she really had no great concern
'Cause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo
Well that's all I needed to know
We found what we needed on the seashores of old Mexico

I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' .44 beneath my head

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I ran too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico

Late in the hot joints takin' the pills
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty heck that shot your woman down

Said yes, oh yes my name is Willy Lee
If you've got the warrant just a-read it to me
Shot her down because she made me sore
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail

Early next mornin' bout a half past nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
Ah, and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty heck into that district court

Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw the little judge commence to look about

In about five minutes in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read murder in the first degree
I hollered Lawdy Lawdy, have a mercy on me

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the San Quentin pen

This is where dreams come to die
Then they fly back to heaven
But this is where dreams come to die

They're fun when you dream them
Everyone is laughing at you
And it's fun, watching them wonder
And all of the dreams are coming true

But this is where dreams come to die
This is where dreams come to die
Then they fly back to heaven
But this is where dreams come to die

This world is just a stop over
On their journey up to the sky
And here's to the trip back to heaven
Maybe be safe as they fly

This is where dreams come to die
Then they fly back to heaven

Merle Travis,"In scarlet Town where I was born 
There was a fair maid dwelling 
Made many a youth cry well a day 
Her name was Barbara Allen 

It was in the merry month of May 
When green buds they were swelling 
Sweet William came from the west country 
And he courted Barbara Allen 

He sent his servant unto her 
To the place where she was dwelling 
Said my master's sick, bids me call for you 
If your name be Barbara Allen 

Well, slowly, slowly got she up 
And slowly went she nigh him 
But all she said as she passed his bed 
Young man I think you're dying 

Then lightly tripped she down the stairs 
She heard those church bells tolling 
And each bell seemed to say as it tolled 
Hard hearted Barbara Allen 

O, mother, mother go make my bed 
And make it long and narrow 
Sweet William died for me today 
I'll die for him tomorrow 

They buried Barbara in the old church yard 
They buried Sweet William beside her 
Out of his grave grew a red, red rose 
And out of hers a briar 

They grew and grew up the old church wall 
Till they could grow no higher 
And at the top twined a lover's knot 
The red rose and the briar",Barbara Allen
Merle Travis,"I am a pilgrim and a stranger
Traveling through this wearisome land
And I've got a home in that yonder city, good Lord
And it's not (good Lordy it's not) not made by hand

I got a mother, a sister and a brother
Who have gone to that sweet home
And I am determined to go and see them, good Lord
Over on (good Lordy over on) that distant shore

As I go down to that river Jordan
Just to bathe my weary soul
If I could touch but just the hem of His garment, good Lord
I believe (good Lordy I believe) that it would make me whole

Merle Travis,"Little Lilly was oh! So silly and shy
And all the fellows knew,
She wouldn't bill and coo:

o cuddle up to her, but she would cry:

Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
I'm beside him, Mercy!
Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me,

Ev'ry minute he gets bolder,
Now he's leaning on my shoulder,

She'd always stay at home;
All the neighbors knew little Lilly too well.
For when the boys would call, They'd hear her yell:

If you peek in, Can't you see I'm goin' to weaken?

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

Hello there stranger how do you do
there's something I'd like to say to you
You seem surprised I recognize
I'm no detective but I just surmise

You're from the place I'm longing to be
your smiling face seems to say to me
You're from my homeland my sunny homeland

Are you from Dixie I say from Dixie where the fields of
cotton beckon to me
I'm glad to see you tell me I'll be you and the friend

Are you from Dixie I say from Dixie 'cause I'm from Dixie

Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine

Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home 
And pity the miner digging my bones

Merril Bainbridge,"I came across a cache of old photos
And invitations to teenage parties
""Dress in white"" one said, with quotations
From someone's wife, a famous writer
In the nineteen-twenties
When you're young you find inspiration
In anyone who's ever gone
And opened up a closing door
She said: ""We were never feeling bored

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end""

When I went I left from the station
With a haversack and some trepidation
Someone said: ""If you're not careful
You'll have nothing left and nothing to care for
In the nineteen-seventies""
But I sat back and looking forward
My shoes were high and I had scored
I'd bolted through a closing door
I would never find myself feeling bored

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
You could always rely on a friend

Now I sit with different faces
In rented rooms and foreign places
All the people I was kissing
Some are here and some are missing
In the nineteen-nineties
I never dreamt that I would get to be
The creature that I always meant to be
But I thought in spite of dreams
You'd be sitting somewhere here with me

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
You could always rely on a friend

And we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""

Merril Bainbridge,"She stops for coffee every morning
Grabs the paper while she's yawning
Wishing she was still in bed
And though her cup is always full
The 8am express is leaving her without
A choice to stay
But where does she go
And who really knows the girl deep inside
The one she always tries to hide

Julie, Julie don't you know
You're riding on a carousel
That's going no where round and round
And round when will it end
Don't ever be afraid
To ride upon the biggest pony
Open up the gates and let it carry you away

But every now and then she dreams
Of all, the lovely places she could go
She wonders if she will ever arrive

Everything about you made me feel so lazy 
I never felt so good and yet I feel so bad 
You were the strangest lover that I ever had

Yes, I miss you now you're gone 
You were always telling me just 
What I should wear 
I was always combing all the knots

You're like a fisherman 
Your hook could pull me in 
Put me in a fry pan couldn't wait 
To burn my skin but now I miss you 

But now I miss you

Every Sunday we would laugh a lot 
Making love and breakfast in bed 
You were grumpy when you had to get up 
I would have to toss a coin 
To see who'd make the bed 

I remember when you 
Broke my favourite tea cup 
You'd just smile that silly smile 
It made me upset

What a time we had 
And when I think about those days 
They're not so bad

In such a way

He opens up my fears
To degrees I never thought existed
And he opens up my heart
To relieve the many pains afflicted

Merril Bainbridge,"I finally found the reasons why
Everything I feel inside
Feelings that I cannot hide
Tell me that it's you

Got me acting kinda strange
Like I'm on a different plane
I never thought I could explain
But I know that it's love

I finally found the reason why
Rainbow colors fill the air
People always stop and stare
Whenever I'm with you

Suddenly the flowers bloom
Whistling a happy tune
I never thought I'd understand
But now I know it's love

'Cause when you smile
And look at me, then suddenly
I know why the birds
Keep singing every place I go

I finally found the reason why
Everything is upside down
My feet don't even touch the ground
But now I know that it's love

'Cause when you smile
And look at me, then suddenly
I know why the birds

Seems like only yesterday
Little flower how your beauty lasts
It always will to me

Floating in around the trees
Flighty as an autumn breeze
Nothing has upset you
All the pain has left you

Little flower lying in the sun
How you soak up every ray
Little flower take it while you're young
It may never shine again

When you open up I see
What a gift you've given me
Nothing has upset you
All the pain has left you

Little flower have you grown to be
Everything you wanted
Little flower is your earth complete
It always seems to be

What we give we reap and sow
Closer to me that you know
I could never let you go

I want to be a satellite to your world

When all the pleasures in heaven are yours 
You can take what you want from me 
You got me spinning around you 
You got me spinning around you

Driving me to something I'll regret

What if I make the change?
What if I lose all my courage this time?

Try but I can't seem to make a decision that's right

Looks like a princess in her new dress

And the sun is gonna shine
""Every winter was a war"", she said
""I want to get what's mine""

Won't try to deny where she came from
You can see it in her pride
And the raven in her eyes
Try show her a better way
She'll say, ""You don't know what you've been missing""
By the time she blinks you know she won't be listening

Don't think I'm distant
It's just the resistance
And my mind's been bidding for years
To protect my heart

Don't think I'm distant

And my mind's been bidding for years
To protect my heart

Don't think I'm distant

Message,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon
Message To Venus,"Come with me into the trees 
We'll lay on the grass 
And let the hours pass 
Take my hand come back to the land 
Let's get away just for one day 
Let me see you stripped down to the bone 
Let me see you stripped down to the bone 
Metropolis has nothing on this 
You're breathing in fumes 
I taste when we kiss 
Take my hand come back to the land 
Where everything's ours 
For a few hours 
Let me see you 
Stripped down to the bone 
Let me see you 
Stripped down to the bone 
Let me hear you make decisions 
Without your television 
Let me hear you speaking 
Just for me let me see you 
Stripped down to the bone 
Let me hear you speaking 
Just for me let me see you 
Stripped down to the bone 
Let me hear you crying just for me",Stripped

No use to kick each others balls
Mosh a peaceful way,
Violent brutal thrashers don't need to stay.
Enjoy yourself, non-violent moshing instead of fighting,
Enjoy yourself

We don't care if black or white
All together for a pacifistic fight
We fight for freedom and liberty,
But against destruction and brutality

Messiah,"For fifty-two years
We have been married
We've had a lucky life
But now the problems have begun

She's really changed, I can't understand my wife
What's happened with her mind
She keeps forgetting things
I realize the degeneration of her memory
Her lack of independence
Distractedness, personality decline
Obstructions of recollections

The years pass slowly
A lot has changed in my life
She's living with a persecution complex
My wife's a total physical wreck

She's regressing more and more
Her behaviour is like infancy
I see only a grown-up foetus

Nobody will help her
I know she will die
By the alzheimer's disease",Alzheimer's Disease
Messiah,"I see the crusade of mentally disturbed persons
All kinds of mutilated and distraught human beings
Drag alone to the shrouded legend realm

They are suspended high over the burning earth
And leave their earthly existence for their new life

You were redeemed of your worldly torments
Torments of isolation, injustice, lies
Maltreatment, abandonment, mutilation and genocide

Choirs of redemption resound through the sky
Tombones complete the ascent of the deformed creatures

The way is far
Their bodies soar

Angels appear and escort them to their new life
Feelings of pleasure, releif and blissfulness

With their white vestment they look so innocent
They embody the pure joie de vivre
Which they had missed in their past life

The cherubs lead the crusade to the dark tunnel
At the end of the tube, there is a bright light

This will be the end of their long trip
To the unknown fourth dimension
Nobody knows what's behind the light
And what they will do there

They are suspended so easily together with the angels
I'm losing sight of the ones right at the front

They suffered
Since the beginning
Now they've left the
Earthly existence

The ascent brings
Eternal bliss
To everyone
On the crusade

You're still asking yourself, will it be better, the new life?
Will you get the chance to live a normal life?
Were you living a bad life as a person, in your life before?
Your biggest dream was to see god, when you arrived at the gates of heaven
Can you see him?",Ascension of a Divine Ordinance
Messiah,"Murder and manslaughter ruled my life
Eliminated my enemies and killed my wife
Nothing to lose, I'm condemned to death
Enjoy the prison, till my last breath

Either you kill or you will be killed, this was my sacred system
No possibility to live with these rules, I followed my wisdom
I have no regrets about my evil deeds, this was the way to exist
Wriggle my neck out of the noose could make an artist

My fate is decided life or death
I whil away the time with games of chess
I wished for a better end not to wait for my execution
My name will be deleted this will be my termination

It's gruesome to wait for the unknown, I don't know my fate
Killing time and wait for mercy, that's what I hate
Living in fear and trepidation there's hope yet
I'm in fear of god, he has decided about my punishment

Many years passed all of these were past
Nothing has changed, every evening could be last
Apathy becomes apparent, I feel so brainless
I know for certain, I will die a natural death",Condemned Cell
Messiah,"For two weeks, I was sitting in the prison cell
Iron gates obstruct the way to be free
Now, I've enough time to think about my offence
This deed was dreadful and I deeply regret it

I don't like to talk about the things that happened
My mind has drifted to this transgression

The pictures of the offence reflect in my brain
Only now I'm realizing what I have done
Horrible nightmares constantly cross my sleep
At the time it's really hard to live in the cell

Tears run over my cheeks
I've never noticed that before
This is a serious situation
Never could I imagine
I killed an innocent girl
She had the right to live
So I have it too
I know that's my crime
Although the people
Are not blameless

I have the chances ruined for my future
It will be hard to find a new job
My name is murder, it says too much
Everybody will get out of my way

Lost the power, destroyed my pride
My life is ruined, lose my future

She will have nothing more to do with me

When I leave the prison in one year",Contrition
Messiah,"Humans born healthy
We converse all the time
Humans born deformed
We avoid all of them

Your body's crippled, your face deformed
Your hand's mutilated, your skin's burnt
My body's well-shaped, my face is striking
My hand's delicate, my skin's very neat

I can't see in your eyes
Why don't you look at me?
You don't belong in our society
You belong in a closed sanatorium

I'm shocked by your body
You're angry at our refusal
I'm horrified by your face
You're infurious at our inequity

All dreadful beings are creations of god
God has decided you'll live as a clod

God has decided, ill or healthy
He forgot justice
Was this the life you wished for
Spending your life in a closed sanatorium",Deformed Creatures
Messiah,"God created a world, a world of injustice, a world of distrust
He created humans, humans of prejudice, humans with selfishness
He forgot the justice, justice of humanity, justice of equality
You created our faults, pain in our bodies, weakness of our brains

[Chorus:]
For those who will fail
Ora, uxorem, natura

We talk about humans, they couldn't live a real life
Expelled from their families in a remote closed sanitarium
They remain will they'll die
We still shun all these human beings, are we too sensitive?
Why haven't they a place in our society, who takes the blame?
We are all responsible and it's a sacrifice of our limited system
Our system forbids us to see in their eyes and to talk to them

[Chorus]
If they are too weak for society, they will be isolated
The other ones get their revenge

Why can we not be happy to work with them, is this impossible?
When we meet these humand, we're afraid and they give us the creeps
But later we're happy and laugh at these innocent creatures
If we would open our minds, they could be our best friends

[Chorus]",For Those Who Will Fail
Messiah,"The time has come to tell you about my deed
No way to understand how long my heart has bled
I see my life in pictures torments and pleasures
Survived through many conflicts my life gives me no pleasures

My life will not be over, although I'm cast down
It will begin now, the other way around
I let self-drift from my sexual feelings
They are too important for human beings",Lines of Thought of a Convicted Man
Messiah,"I look in the mirror, I see another face
Waiting for my end will be my painful race
My appearance has altered since I consulted my surgeon
He told me about my illness, will survive one season

Drinking is what I need to forget my daily sorrow
Sadness is forgotten, will feel better tomorrow
Living with a confidence will not be better
My body is going weaker, my walking is a stagger

Jesus, I beg of thee, redeem my endless pain
Forgive my sin and save my life, that's only what I need
I prayed to you, every night, is this your thank to me?

I know you made this illness and drove me insane
It's my intention to fight this battle against you
Truth and denomination destroyed my life
There exists only hate and rage in my head

Pictures of my childhood cross my brain all the time
Happiness was easy, there weren't evil minds
Sadness was a foreign word, I never felt better
I played with my friends, day in, day out

I've got a lot of thoughts about my future
My body's a piece of misery, I'm crippled like a creature
Perishing in my bed and watching children play
Shall I wait for my end, will this be the right way
My torment is getting stronger, suicide is my solution
Nobody will cry for me, they will treat me like a felon
Everybody has forsaken me, delivery is my knife
Will suicide be the way to search for a new life",Living With a Confidence
Messiah,"Father and mother divorced as I began the school in hamilton
We had the same problem every night with daddy's addiction
Violence and drunkeness reigned his every day and made us down
I felt really distraught as he finally left our home

The time after was difficult, I felt rather unnerved
Because of my ugly appearance, they treated me like a fool
A misfit, I was derided by the girls of our school
I reached the height of my mental quandary
More and more I shied away and went my lonely way

The time of retaliation will come
Fear, pain, torment
They will come
Admiration, worship
They will treat me like a god

To talk with my schoolmates about girls was an abomination
Possessing a girl was my biggest sexual imagination
I had realized that this idea could never be reality
Dazzled through my sexual lust I planned many different strategies

I possessed no bad conscience only one aim in my eyes
The act of cruelty considered the last details in my mind
A long time to wait for the sunset and the sacrifice made me blind
She was my number one girl, young with her long fair hair
I struck her and dragged her body to the thicket where I raped her

At this moment you were my girl and my dream was reality
She saw my face, there was no other choice but to kill her
Only now I had understood what I had done
I left the scene of the crime quickly and went home

I can't live with the thoughts that I killed a young girl
This was my past but I'm not proud about now
Although I killed a girl, they couldn't give me a life sentence
After one year in the youth custody unit I will be free
Fortunately we all live in a cracked system where you can kill",Raped Bodies

Write a song a day but she won't like it anyway

Staring at the ceiling
No longer believing everything

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

In a path, splattered gore all through the night
Wakin' up at midnight, my bodies soaked in sweat
All my friends are down the stairs, watching the TV set

Hearing now a scratching noise outside my window pane
Wondering if it's real or am I going insane
Running fast to lock the doors, a banshee now awaits
Seconds count, I warn my friends, or is it now too late?

And all my sleepless dreaming
It all turns into dust

In lifeless shadows dreaming
My life is left un-feeling
And yet beyong this door
There must be more

My freedoms become too expensive
The price is much more than you see
But freedom creates an illusion
The freedom to save me from me

I gotta get some of that magic

While the prayers have been said
All the love that's been bled
Its just a kiss for the dead

In your world of constant dreams
A lifeless body with its frozen stare
People cry and pray for you to waken
All this pain you cannot bear
Wishing someone would pull the plug
All you do is shed a tear
No feelings

This world of sleeping, continue dreaming

To see the light now, in endless night now
Could cleanse this chaos from my mind

We try to keep within 
Listen doctor you cannot help me
The cure that's in a jar
All the needless all the pills

Now the pain is really blinding
I'm crawling up the wall

Try to stop it
I think I've lost it all 
Can't you see just where the troubles
All are in my head
Iron bars that keep me safe
While strapped here on this bed
You've poked and probed and podded me
So often times I've cried

As you wheel me down the hall

My time is finished here
Now choose what you must do
My eyes have shed the tears
And paid the price for you

The devil sits and wonders
The man who keeps his heart a stone
Is the man who sleeps with thunder

Monuments and shrines are built to spirits that deceive
Soft associations with the angels you believe
Soon to find your friendly guides have lead you far astray
Now you walk in blackest night you never learned to pray

In your mind you pacify
Tricks and tales and lullabies
Now you bid your soul goodbye

So the list was captured
And it's time for us to die
Following their orders
To enforce the lie

Township by town
Hung drawn and quartered
Some where slowly drowned

They signed in blood
Proclaimed their faith
They signed in blood
And sealed their fate

There' s more to this world than meets the eye

The riders are coming the hoofbeats are thumping
The spectre of death leads the way

And those who have signed be killed by the blind

Man, I've struggled with temptation and sin, in my darkest thoughts
When will this nightmare ever stop, I'm waiting for the bomb to drop
I walked through the valley of the shadow of death, how did I survive

I stood at the flaming gates again, as the flames grew higher
What have I done to deserve this fate, what have I become
Though dark have been my dreams of late, I just need to be strong
I'm going down, its my last shot, I'm waiting for the bomb to drop

I'm on my knees and I'm praying for these dreams to cease,

From points unknown in senseless daze, watching as the fools parade
The tower bells are pounding like a drum
Glance back at a new world brave, the cradle has become the grave
And people praise the God they've stolen from

In this world we have false leaders, wearing the mask of the deceiver
They're seeking out the non-believers, and in these masks you'll never see us

Pedestrian of common streets, an angel in disguise
A childhood spent as any other, any other child
Would bring a great divide, and now these worlds collide
Now that many years have passed , these dreams intensify, 
No tools I use, no crystal ball

Yet I'm still mystified
Those sleepless nights by candlelight, in a room without a view
A voice I could not hear, it told me, ""Write it down you fool""
It spoke to me of many things no language can explain, 
I grabbed my crucifix left hanging
By it's golden chain

Never in my wildest dreams, conceive of what I heard, 
I filled the well with ink
And began writing every word, in the night

I've seen the mountains crumbling, the masses running scared, 
I wrote it down to warn you all
But you laughed and no one cared

You wrote it down in riddles, no one could understand, 
I'll lead you to your padded room
You prophet-crazy man

Please hear me and heed every word that I've said, if you kill me
You'll be the one's who'll be dead, dead and gone

Your locks and your bars, will hide all my scars, but you'll never leave this place
Not til you open your eyes and your ears, can you make sense of the things that you fear?
And all that you've heard, it sounds so absurd, I'll never speak again
Not til you open your eyes and your ears, this world shall pass away

Withdrawn from reality, I stare into space, 
Little did they know I held the answers to their fate
I didn't write in riddles, now you must understand,

I can't stop re-living my past

Beyond the sunless sky, so far away, beyond the sunless sky
Torn, I've torn you in two, what can I do, I'm lost in confusion
Time, I've run out of time, the clock ticks away, just keeping time, an illusion
I wallow in the darkness, I suffer through the pain, ripping through the madness
Til life's been re-gained

I'm nothing but a shell of what I used to be
I'm washed upon the shore of my checkered past

Guilt and lies, pave a road to nowhere, fear inside, everyday
But in the end, this web that we're caught in
Will release us, release us from pain
And things will change

Make some mistakes, it's part of the game, when you play it everything's to gain
The weight of the world upon your shoulders, it's the weight of the world
The struggle within archaic desire, claim your right and devour
All that surrounds you, all you can take, don't let your last
Be your last mistake

The pressure is building, the vice becomes tighter, 
Under the gun and into the fire
Burning and burning, no escape to be found

Spreading fear with hateful eyes, then into the night they ride

They look to the sky with fear in their eyes, they pray to their gods
And they pray to survive, closing their eyes, they dream to ride
On the wings of tomorrow

Beyond this realm of death and darkness, lies the key, someone to save them
To change their ways, to fight the good fight, they're hoping for the day
To the gods they pray for salvation, an angry call from a dying nation
They'll survive, they've seen it before, again their wings will soar
They look to the sky with faith as their guide, changing tomorrow
Before our demise, a rage deep inside, they live to fly
On the wings of tomorrow

They ride into the sky, into the crimson sky
Hoping one day that things will change

To the end of time, until that day comes, they will live on,
To ride on the wings of tomorrow",Wings of Tomorrow

I'm innocent of their decisions, I wonder why dad left
Every night I hide in bed and plan to run away

A lonely child with battered eyes
No joy in innocence they cry
Always has to lie his way through life

A kid deprived of love in life has no alternative in sight
He throws up barriers to get him through
A human life's a gift from God
Your conscience and your heart are gone
You're much to cruel to have a point of view

No one to turn to, oh, how dare you
How does a child get himself out of harm's way?
A price no one should pay

Can't you see the tears they're crying
Don't you care your kids are dying?
From the senseless torment that you put them through

There's different kinds of lies to tell
Abuse is from the pit of hell
A demon with a goal that is to kill

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place

But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Look inside and you will see
The words are cutting deep inside my brain
Thunder burning, quickly burning
Knife of words is driving me insane
Insane, yeah

Raven black is on my track
He shows me how to neutralize the knife
Show to me in surgery
The art of fighting words to conquer life
Conquer life, yeah


Now the wicked lance of fear
Is driving from my heady mountain brain
Crash course in brain surgery
Has stopped the bloody knife of words again

Metallica,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Last Caress/Green Hell

The moon has frozen blue
Long black coats a shelter for the rain
Their load must get through
Now bats are leaving their trees
They're joining the call
Seven satanic Hell preachers heading for the hall
Bringing the blood of a newborn child
Got to succeed  if not it's Satan's fall

Way out in Egypt in the valley of kings
Where the mummified pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you

The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly
Just destroying your future
Makin' it all shady
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill  (for the kill)
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you

Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse
I'm a corpse without soul
Satan, he's taken, he's taken
He's taken his toll
And he took it on me

I, I'm trapped, I'm trapped
I'm trapped in his spell
Tonight, I'm going, I'm going
I'm going to Hell, inside his spell

Howl like a wolf
And a witch will open the door
Follow me and meet our high priestess
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child

Undress until you're naked
And put on this white coat
Take this white cross and go to the center of the ring
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child

I was born on the cemetery
Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave by the dead
And I was made a mercenary
In the legions of Hell
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane

You know my only pleasure
Is to hear you cry
I'd love to hear you cry
I'd love to see you die
And I'll be the first
To watch your funeral
And I'll be the last to leave
I'd love to hear you cry

And when you're down beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame

And our souls is magnetic, we the meaning of destiny
Be that banker of trust that looks to invest in me
Together, to get her, means for me to get you
We back, reunite like the Wu
See we soul mates, we melt like cookies and cream
And I fiend for the days and the nights to sex my queen
So no matter how hard it seems, dreams come true
Keep Allah in our hearts, hugs and kisses, Toney Starks

[Chorus]

Uh, still applying the pain
The purple frying my brain, this woman's crying again
She, tired of fighting, my feelings likely the same
That's what happens when you wife 'em and they try to tighten the chain
See, she in the right, so I put her right in her lane
I'm all night with the pipe, I can feel her biting my chain
She, got her own, I ain't gotta buy her a thang
I be burning up the sheets every time I'm lighting the game
We, go together like, Martin and Gina, but
She get uptight when we fight like Ike and Tina, so
Love her or leave her alone, like I ain't need her tho
A minute later I'm back, like I ain't mean it, yo
We break up, just to make up, she fly without the makeup
Together we upgrade to A plus
So all this bickering ain't us, we bigger than that
You normally cool when I'm digging your back, now fall back, baby

[Chorus]

Shorty with the flavor like Breyer's, real sweet with your thick legs
Look like you drink eggs, you lying
Now you met a teflon don, stay high, Levi's on
Wire cell frames, no games
I'm into cashing in, getting this paper, buying up acres
Ride around, and yo, fuck with my neighbors
Pocket full of hundreds and weed, light the Philly cigar up
And go dolo, riding through SoHo
You hear the little baby in the back? That's the sound of sweet life
A sweet wiz'll make you a sweet night
And chill with the pawns we on, cuz life is a chessboard
You better have you sword and vest on
Never hate your enemies, cuz it effects judgment
They only hate it if they know you getting hella cheese
That's what it is, what it do for you
Don't let the truth bore you, word up, don't let the roof spoil

Method Man,"Yo mama don't wear no drawers!
I saw her when she took them off!
Standin' on the welfare line
Eating swine tryin' to look fine, with her stank behind
You can ask the bitch and she'll tell ya fast
Meth-Tical got style with his nasty ass

Are you ready, to face the consenquences and suffer?
I even tell ya momma you ain't shit, motherfucker
Bring it, and let that killer bee kid sting it
And rep-resent, it's like heads up a brick, when I swing it
Get lost, I break you off something
I'm pumpin', like a Reebok, with a pump, from the jump and
You was nothin'
Bet ya thought ya fuckin' clan had ya back but they was frontin'
Smokin' dirt blunts and fuckin' nasty stunts and
Ya take the naked gun without the bullet, what ya bustin'
Get ya ship sunken, fuckin' with a drunken
Master disaster at any rap functions

Who said the Wu-Tang Clan? Was it you or your man?
You wanna point the finger, I'll bring ya
36 chambers, be out, youze in danger
Let me pull ya brain outcha ass with a hanger
Didn't momma not tell ya not to talk to a stranger
Now ya got ya neck, in the noose, of the strangler
Just recline, keep the Meth in mind
I'll even test the knuckle check on the hands of time
What? And I'll be more than glad to bust that ass
All up and down the block, the street, that ave
Whatever, smokin' on a Spike Lee joint
Hey I'm Mo' Better, I'm hopin' niggas get the point
Cause they could never, stop the veteran, word to God
When I'm severin' the HEAD of a mental vegetarian
The Method, at the weekend, with a whole lot of credit
The cuties I desire, I be the first to set it
Off, flame on like the Human Torch
Fantastic Four for all the fans in the store
You can eat it all and it'll tell ya fast
Meth-Tical got STYLE for ya nasty ass",Biscuits
Method Man,"Basically, can't fuck with me

I came to bring the pain hardcore from the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
Find out my mental's based on instrumental
Records hey  so I can write monumental
Methods, I'm not the King
But niggas is decaf I stick 'em for the cream
Check it  just how deep can shit get
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad fish accept it
In your Cross Color clothes you've crossed over
Then got Totally Krossed Out and Kris Kross
Who the boss? Niggas get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan
I be hectic, and coming for the head piece protect it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket, niggas want the ruckus
Bustin' at me bruh, now bust it
Styles, I gets buckwild
Method Man on some shit, pulling niggas files
I'm sick, insane, crazy, Drivin' Miss Daisy
Out her fuckin' mind now I got mine I'm Swayze

Is it real son, is it really real son
Let me know it's real son, if it's really real
Something I could feel son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal son, if it's really real

And when I was a lil' stereo (Stereo)
I listened to some champion (Champion)
I always wondered (Wondered)
Will now I be the number one (Tical hahaha)
Now you listen to the Gargon (Gargon)
And the Gargon summary
And any man dat come test me (Test me)
Me gwanna lick out them brains (It's like that)

Brothers want to hang with the Meth bring the rope
The only way you hang is by the neck nigga poke
Off the set comin' to your projects
Take it as a threat, better yet it's a promise
Comin' from a vet on some old Vietnam shit
Nigga you can bet your bottom dollar hey I bomb shit
And it's gonna get even worse word to God
It's the Wu comin' through sickin niggaz for they garments
Movin' on your left, southpaw em it's the Meth
Came to represent and carve my name in your chest
You can come test realize you're no contest
Son I'm the gun that won that old Wild West
Quick on the draw with my hands on the four
Nine three eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof
Huh vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me aiy, give it to me raw
I've learned when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a hoe
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay da mo'

What, basically that, Meth-Tical, ninety-four style
Word up we be hazardous
Northern spicy brown mustard hoes
We have to stick you

Is it real son, is it really real son
Let me know it's real son, if it's really real
Something I could feel son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal son, if it's really real

I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin' cut your kneecaps off
And make you kneel in some staircase piss

I'll fuckin', cut your eyelids off
And feed you nuthin' but sleepin' pills

Fuck the hoe

Method Man,"Niggas wanna test my steez, nigga please
I black that eye like peas, you better freeze
In your tracks, a wu, tang killer bee's on ya back
I comes for the honey plus the phat money sack
You want it all? yeah I want it all like that
I stab my own moms in the back for a stack
Niggas like, ""damn, why you want it like that?"" (why is that?)
Cause I'm a dog, and I got no love for the cat (uh)
Attitude's cold like the north polar cap
Where I do my dirt's a little further down the map (is that so?)
A little buck wilding, island called stat'
Where niggas carry gats in they black moon hat
Now I'm mad known for the bones and the rap
And you's an unknown with a faulty contract
Wake up and smell the met, chod motherfucker contact
Villain in the cypher from the foe when head crack
An indian giver and I'm out to take it back
Shaolin island, baby where you at?
A runaway train that be runnin on ya track
That's how it's goin down, yeah, it's goin down like that

I gets my thang in action
To live, to love, to see, to learn
Yo! tell em what's happenin!

I'll tell yo' ass what's happenin
Tell em what's happenin
It's goin on out here, brothers ain't got no peers
And they smokin funny, shuddup yo' damn mouth!)

I swing funky rap routines and tap the jaws
Spot ya twenty points and you still can't score
Nuttin, cause you ain't got no points in this game
Kid you frontin, I'm home run hittin', you be buntin'
Fresh out the toilet, I got my shit together
When I'm good, I'm good, when bad, I'm better
You want it? whatever, I'll be the stormy weather
Rain comin' down, so weatherproof you're leather
Jacket, a nigga with a axe couldn't hack it
I spark em like a match
Coming back it's the met, chod, say it loud
I'm the met, chod, man, clap yo' hands, now check it
See me in the mix, rollin fat, bustin' flicks
While my physical brother came through and got me lift
Niggas, that I walk by, give me the eye
The moment is fuckin' me up, killin' my high
Nigga get back, ya pussy cat, I'm fearsome
Basically that, I'm all of that, and then some
While I, was out on tour, goin' beserk
I heard you was at the sandbox and kickin dirt
All on my name but you can't pull my file

Who lit that shit it was I the chinky-eye
Cheeba-hawk from New York, Tical Staten Isle

A bad situation, 'cause I'm a sandwich short
Of a picnic, 'cause you ain't equipped with the sickening
Style, blowing up the spot like ballistic
Missiles, I be comin' through like the four-nine-three-eleven
Tearing up the power-you, Me-Tical
A bad motherfucking buddah monk, what the fuck
Hit your chest, like cardiac arrest, blow the front
Out the frame, hit the pussycat for the pain
Of the dog shit, nobody move run your garments
A rugged vet, terrible like a Champion sweat
Wrap a power in a tec, to wet
A nigga up, with all the dangerous diseases
Sniffling sneezing coughing aching stuffy head fever

You could try to front, get smoked and that's that
Lyric assassin, dressed in black buggin'
Sixteen shots to your mug, from a slug then
I go to war in a concrete jungle, make the punt
'Cause niggas act funny, and fumble
But I relax, count my shells, a lot of heads gotta fly
Niggas stay strapped, armed to die
Time for jet-black Tim boot, flowin'
Wha'-Su God get him, hit 'em with the nine troop

Serious, the craziest
D-da, (Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream) day-da
Danger, dangerous style

Lyrical shots from the glock
Bust bullet holes on the chops, I want the number one spot
With the science, of a giant
New York defiant, brutal like domestic violence
Silence of the Lambs, occurred when I slammed in
Foes grab their chairs, to be mad as Ralph Cramden
Others come with shit, as silly as Art Carney
But my Tetley triplizes, more kids than Barney
Never need for stress there's three bags of sess
A damn I rest, playing chess, yes
My thoughts be sneaky like a crook from Brooklyn
When you ain't lookin', I take the queen, with the rook then
I get vexed, layin' phat trax on Ampex
Morphous God, gettin' drunk, off a Triple X
Violent time, I got more love than valentines
The violent mind, I blast with a silent nine

My hazardous thoughts to cut the mic's life support short
Brains get stained like tablecloths when I let off
Powerful, poetry pushed past the point of no return
Leavin' mics with third-degree burns
Let me at 'em, I cramp your style like a spasm
Track em through the mud then I bag em
We're screaming hardcore, hip-hop drips out my balls
And I be raw, for four score plus seven more
I strike like a bowling ball, holding y'all hostage
Like hail, electrifying the third rail
Peep the smash on paragraphs of ruckus
Wu-Tang (Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck wit)

Hot time, summer in the city
My people represent, get busy
The heat-seeker, on a mission from hell's kitchen
I gets in where I fits in for head-touchin, listen
Enemy, is the industry got me flippin
I don't give a fuck tell that bitch and a nigga
I'm killin, snipin, catchin murder cases
Desert Storm-in, I be searchin for oasis
As I run a mile with a racist
Pullin, swords, hit the Billboard with a bullet
Peace to the number seven
Everybody else get the fo'-nine-three-eleven

I don't know what's going on
If you can take us there...

Yo, watch me bang the headpiece there's no survival
My flow lights up the block like a homicidal
Murder, underground beef for the burger
P.L.O., criminal thoughts you never heard of
I switch, the city never sleeps, life's a bitch
I shit, runnin through bitches like Emmitt Smith
Caution, niggaz best to be careful crossin
The street, before they end up layin in a coffin
Don't sleep, niggaz tend to forget, however
Peep this, my nigga Case lives forever

What evil lurks in the heart of men?
It be the shadow, street-life, flowin again
I had a plot, scheme, I knew for sure
Only one kid would knock the hinges off the door
The jerk tried to jet, Sabrina at his neck
Thirteen pounds on the table plus a tec
Just when I said, ""Where the fuck's the cream?""
Another jerk came out the kitchen with the M-16
He tried to cock it, blast these shots like, rockets
Crushed his collarbone, ripped his arm out the socket
My move for the table was swift, I got my hostage
(The nigga tried to stab you God!) but I dodged it
Niggaz said, ""Carlton youse a ill motherfucker""
'Cause I made it look like they both killed each other

Motherfuckers gettin' mad high when they want now
I will survive, recognize it be Tical

Shit's gonna happen if niggas start actin'
Like they want problems, you want 'em, you got 'em
Rap contact, is writin' this exactly, the way it should be
Attacked, Killer Beeeees on a swarm
So what my martial law drops bombs like Qur'an
The ism helps to stimulate my pugilism
I bust rhymes like jizm, impregnate the rhythm with the wisdom
Decipher the flow, I be hyper, I bring all the styles
That rekindle like old flames
Saliva, check the wicked flows I deliva
Oops, I mean deliver like the Hudson River
Styles be tight, trite like a thief in the night
I be the sneaky-ass nigga bustin' nuts in yo wife
Blasted, buggin' off Bacardi and acid
Flippin' on the mic, it's a classic",Sub Crazy
Method Man,"What's that shit that they be smokin?  Tical, tical, tical
Pass it over here, tical, tical, tical
What's that shit the niggaz smokin?  Tical, tical, tical
Pass it over here, tical, tical, tical

Check it, I got styles, all of 'em sick
Niggaz ain't fit to walk a mile in the dead man's kicks
I make 'em shit about a pile, of bricks to show
He ain't nuttin' but another, a lone John Doe
That want to flow, here it is, comin' up shit's creek
I come to throw monkey wrenches in your program, sleep
and I'ma grow, like a rash on ya nasty ass
In a whip, with no breaks and I'm hittin' the gas
It's a bird, it's a plane, take a look in the sky
Method Man on some shit, niggaz call me The Fly
'Cause my style, dates back to hoppin' turnstyles
Make ya fear, if ya cutie in the chair, you can bet I'll
get severe on the double I harass it
I don't look for trouble, I'm already trouble
Ya bastard, check the wicked flows that I crafted
Open up a deadly venom style to be mastered
By a psychopathic, way beyond an average
Joe, with a hellafied flow, there ya have it

What's that shit that they be smokin?  Tical, tical, tical
Pass it over here, tical, tical, tical
What's that shit the niggaz smokin?  Tical, tical, tical
Pass it over here, tical, tical, tical

One two, uh, one two one two
One two, uh, one two one two
One two, uh, one two one two
Check it out

What goes off?  What goes on?  The Meth shit
that we got is to stay high, no question
Lethal weapon, ain't no time for half steppin'
When brothers start wettin' everything in ya section
Move that, niggaz came strapped, shoulda knew that
Do dat, pussy cat rap, boy, I'll screw that
To' up, from the flow up, don't even show up
To the battle, I heard you rattle now hold up
Is there a fuckin' snake in my garden?
Starvin', for a rap treat, steppin' on my feet
Pardon yo delf, before ya find yo delf
In a fucked up situation, without no help
I'm not playin', 'cause I don't play with nobody
God damn kid, know what I'm sayin', I'm peelin' niggas wigs
I be sprayin', brother with words
'Cause I got a spit problem

Tical, tical, tical

Pass it over here, tical, tical, tical",Tical
Method Man,"All I hear is gun shots
Can I touch something?
What the blood claat!
Niggaz want tical  make it happen
You know my fuckin' style  fuck the rappin'
We can take it back to eighty five if you want to start actin' like you live
It's all good, I'm rollin' with my clique
Owls  Packwoods & Phillies  smokin' sess blunts  mixed with illy
Got me bustin'  now the whole world looks dusted
I'm in the area with the skill that never rusted
For real, nigga, touch it & you burn, when will motherfuckers learn
What be spreadin' like a germ? Ha ha, it's Meth, word
I be that early bird that got the worm & if you check it
I'm on point, like a fax machine you get the message
It be no question & them bust the second guessin's
Keep your thoughts on your lessons
What the blood claat!
To tell the truth, you don't amaze me Killa Hill project
A Star Trek phaser couldn't phase me what
Check the Raderuckus fuck this
Smoke a Dutchmaster, have 'em screamin' for the duchess
Yeah, I gotta have it, so I strive to stick my piece
If I don't do it for mydelf, I'm a do it for Kase
'Cause that's my peoples, I'm giving you injections that be Lethal
Weapon, when niggaz start the half steppin'
Then I get evil. But don't let that negative vibe right there
Mislead you, I'm humble, a fucking Killer Bee
Far from bumble, I sting you BZT and I bring you
Thirty-six chambers of head banger, bitch
Why I deal with? I think the mic is on the fritz
Faggot soundmen! They be sabotagin' shit
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Methical, let the whole world know my fuckin' name
What the blood claat!",What the Blood Clot
Method Man,"I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Method Man,"Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah! No we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go let me go
Will not let you go let me go (never)
Never let you go let me go
Never let me go ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me

So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me

Niggas be holdin', you niggas under pressure now 

My squads down for whatever with whoever now 

Let's get it on 

[Star] 

Arm leg shots to hit the spot like a four fifth glock 

We got this hip-hop shilock and all you clique got 

Was lip lock, heavy heat, steady street sweepin your peeps 

Hawks, machete chops puttin' cease to your petty fleets 

This raw rebel got more metal than pop 

And rock groups, when my glock shoots the scores settled 

A ground attack, I'm bound to clap rounds of rap 

Clowns are found flat, face down around the map 

Simple minds, cripple smiles, my rhymes are four five 

The size oh two nines combine, can't even tickle mine 

[Method Man] 

I told you once, I told your ass a thousand times, chump 

Body in the trunk, stay in line punk, 

(Fucking with your mind?) 

[Polite] 

Yo 

You be the actual, sixteen bars, comin' after you 

Never go against my team, they might embarrass you 

Slit-slang terrorist talk, fully armed 

Put your hands up, I'ma put a hole in your paws 

Ruin your side show, eyes low, brains fried from hydro 

Two choices, bass off or either die slow 

We all scholars when it's time to clean a dirty dollar 

Attack the boards, it's like a rotweiler 

[Method Man] 

Niggas comin out they shoes like they Usher 

These motherfuckers on the run, and they socks from 

The bounty hunter, Iron Lungster, rain and thunder 

Here come the lightning now I'm strikin' back at niggas bitin' 

Pushin' buttons just to step away from self-destruction 

Inch and a half away from touchin' somethin' 

Suckin' away from bustin' 

y'all brothers laugh now and cry later 

I rap from Alpha to Omega, sixty four to Sega 

Whoopin' that ass, walk you dogs through the lookin' glass 

Been burnin' MC's since cookin' class 

Makin' it hot like the summer in the crackspot 

With blacktops, my nickle slot, triple bar, hit the jackpot 

On each block, I'm the remedy, send them back to me 

After detock, shorty got knuckles in the Reebok 

Plus we got a problem with the Benz 

(What's the problem with the Benz) 

She want the six-hundred, but she ain't got the ends 

Chorus 

[All] 

You better come with your best gun 

Niggas be holdin', it's all war no fun 

Niggas be bowlin', you niggas under pressure now 

My squads down for whatever with whoever now 

Let's get it on",Elements
Method Man,"""Dropped outta school early so I could get me some paper
That's a good book, I don't mind you gettin knowledge about the game
You dig? So you won't have to have those young girls fool ya, you dig?
Trick ya outta your check, so you can learn about it
Don't try to play if you ain't ready for it
'Cause the game could be detrimental to ya boy.""

I Silver Surf the city circuit, forever lurkin on the street surface
I spit blood for blood verses
Plan span divided, we still stand conquer land
One man'll body slam Def Jam
Focus ya head cam, zoom in, we radio tunin
I know you're listenin so I keep showin and provin
Play the sideline, waitin for the right time to take mine
Street crime, nickel and dime rhyme
Fuck a peace talk, let the gun spark, on the streets of New York
I Shaolin strut through the city asphalt, FED UP
Hold ya head up, I'm circlin the block, keep ya eyes up
Wise up before you get sized up (tied up)
Play no game, speakin on my name you catch a clip full
From close range, diggin in your pocket, take the loose change

Punch the data in ya mainframe
You want it all, I want the same thing
Strive to maintain, live out my name
Hard to obtain, hard to explain, ain't nuttin changed
Leave the same way I came, Bringin motherfuckin Pain

Killa Hill projects, hi-tech street intellect
Best connect, blow your headset, fuck a mic check

Bring em round the underground, pocket full of sound
Ashes to ashes y'all niggaz goin down

Eat shit and die slow, battle ground no survival
You goin down, y'all niggaz fuck around
Shittin where you sleepin, so my rhyme Proposal came Indecent
Beef from the butcher, sink your teeth in

Fuck what you believe in, you real-fake
Fishin in the same lake, eatin off the same cake you blow face

Who go that ready cook, synthetic look, actin crook
Betty shook worm, tryin to shake the hook as the world turn
Nigga burn, once again the Super Sperm, rub it in
Your skin, like it's Lubriderm, time took to write this
The war will be fought by the righteous
Who stand criticized by his un Alikeness
Knowledge is the truth and it's priceless
Real like them Rahway Lifers, nuttin but time on my hands
Observe the black sands in the hourglass, fallin fast
In the savage land haulin ass, Days of Thunder
It's Road Rage, your days are numbered
What RZA put together let no man tear asunder (motherfucker!)

This is P.L.O., Killa Hill flow but you don't hear me though
Live in stereo, pumpin loud until your speaker blow
Ghetty-o slang pro, sling rap for cash flow
Keep it live from the intro until the outro

Killa Hill projects, hi-tech street intellect
Best connect, blow your headset, fuck a mic check

Bring em round the underground, pocket full of sound
Ashes to ashes y'all niggaz goin down

I'm on a suicide run, y'all niggaz know the outcome
Razor sharp tongue leave scars in your eardrum
Forty-five bar seminar, ghetto rap star
Slide like water rats through the Staten Reservoir
Swingin swords cut your mic cord, snatch ya rap awards
Commercial cats fuckin up the game, that's why I crash boards
Break laws, wired jaw, keep on tryin yours
Hardcore, something that my street niggaz is dyin for

Snatch your neck and the dope fiend, Golgo 13
Professionals wit no things, say no more
Check my Dogs at the Reservoir
Gourmet special of the day is n*gga Souflee, pusher gotta pay
And the games people play, John J. back around the way
Fish filet, Mister DJ, turn it up a notch
Hit the replay, for dirt bomb niggaz in the P.J.
To Klingon, bring on, the Good Times for Keyon
Hood rhymes that's be-yond ya thinkin
For eons, I've been hear to shine on the black minds
Tell you like the last time, year of the grimy n*gga
Rag time, bad sign, flatline

And you know another motherfuckin' thing? 
I don't give a fuck if a bitch spill a drink 
in this motherfucker tonight 
I'm kickin' all y'all the fuck outta here 

Uh, muh'fuckers be up in the club scared to fuckin' death 
Nigga if you scared why don't yo' ass just stay the fuck home 
Check it out, uh, me and mines at the door, ain't tryin to pay your fees 
Stop playin, you fuckin' with me, I push my way in 
Bum rush there's plenty of us to tear the club up 
Guzzlin' Bacardi and such, I split a Dutch 
Bouncin' nigga lookin' like he want war 
Now I ain't the one you got to front Pah 
Pattin me down like the law, as I stumble in the party 
Topsey off the Limon Bacardi for sure 
Loungin' near the bar section, rolled the L 
And kept steppin', concealed weapon, razor sharp 
Blue star hatchet, in the sleeve of my jacket 
Who that kid, on the dance floor lookin' for matches? 
Burn somethin', one toke got me blasted 
Took another toke then I passed it, choke! 
Fantastic, herb ain't no joke 
Especially that into smoke mixed with hashish 
Ladies on the dance floor, shakin' they asses 
Got million dollar broke niggaz, that makin' passes 
Honey with the eye glasses, body work is Boombastic 
Skin like blackberry molasses, mm 
At last it's, time to step and make her mine 
Niggaz headin' toward the bathroom tuckin' they shines 
Brothers got to keep it movin', playin with kids 
That won't hesitate to snatch a Cuban 
You know what this is
(""Yo Duke that's your diamonds right there God? 
Yo that shit'll go right where my people ain't right now"" 
""Yo don't touch my shit!"") 
Now it's on in the lavatory, I heard a scream 
End of story couldn't find shorty, party scene's 
Now a fucked up chaotic thing, won't be long 
Before the sirens intervene, the territory 
Can't we all get along, without the ruckus 
Got big bouncin' muh'fuckers, tryin to rush us 
I can take a hint, what? Can smell the stench 
Of a hell bent environment, the odds against us 
Back to the wall y'all, refuse to fall 
All hands on deck yes, prepare to brawl 
Uh, every time I try to have a good time why? 
Somebody always fuckin' it up, killin' my high, damn 
Monkey wrench they whole program, party over 
By that time I'm dead sober 
In the midst of this whole shit fo' soldiers, dead gone 
You can tell that they was heat holders 
Everybody hit the deck when they expose tech, I fled the set 
Bitch slipped and caught a broke neck, some Brooklyn kids 
Rushed the coat check, they whole set, stompin' Duke 
Half to death and took his Rolex, it's horrible 
Like a front page article, Mister Pitiful 
About a step away now we critical, uh 
As I boned out I heard the people shout

If these shells hit the battleground, pave the way 

for birth of a Generation, X 

Spoken with a project dialect, bomb threat 

to the air waves, hit the deck 

Pressed for time in a world lacking sunshine 

Got love for my family, cause they mine 

See niggaz dying in the streets over petty crimes

Of filth, fine filth flavors 

Dust to dust, and ashes to ashes, life flashes 

Right before his eyes, then he passes

[Method Man] 

Ha  yeah yeah yeah  yeah yeah 

One time.. yo 

Never liked son from day one  bring you tool 

That nigga stick you and play dumb  hate a bitch ass 

Who care where you came from  you ain't prepared 

for when the pain come  this nigga scared  shook to death 

from a cold stare  stuntin  knowin my brothers fiend 

to do you somethin over here  we head huntin 

in the function I smell fear, adrenaline start pumpin 

I Smash Pumpkins, Hard Rock be in the Cafe 

Tear the club up, and anyone that try to judge us 

The last days, makin sure I get the last say 

In the food chain, is you predator or prey? 

If you featherweight, lyrics blow your back 

crack your vertabrae, lookin for a better way 

to get my point across, thoughts accelerate 

at the same speed, of the murder rate 

Lord, never perpetrate a fraud, til my nigga Carlton Fisk 

see the boss, truly yours, Mr. Meth 

[Street Life] 

Life's a snippet, one way ticket 

Time tickin fast, blink you might miss it 

Semen on Street shit, you might catch fifty stitches 

Body bag sprayed up, buried in muddy ditches 

I play for keeps, bust heat you catch cold feet 

My rap sheet, speak for itself, concrete 

Evident, Killa Hill, resident, double dart agent 

Secret intelligent my rap style's flagrant

In the city that you never sleep, pay attention 

Ain't no shittin when you gotta eat, we hold it down

I move like Mad Max 'cross the wasteland 

One hand holds the head of the last brave man 

Made man, Cuban Link chain of command 

Authorized fam', hot like Sahara sand 

My live team turn the club to a crime scene 

High beams flash, promoters die behind CREAM 

Get your face blown, might face the chrome 

We take this more serious than just a poem 

[Havoc] 

I think about a lot of shit, especially when I'm bent 

About the foul shit goin on in my life, current event 

It's evident I smoke ciggarette down to Brownsville 

Thinkin to myself -- how many lives must my pound kill? 

Hopefully none, ain't the one to give chase 

Hemmed by Jake, worryin who might turn state's 

So I chill, put my killa niggaz on the battlefield 

On the low plottin silent murderer, never doubt still 

never follow beef hey beef follow me 

want to settle in the court I say settle in the streets 

like our pops did it, you got gats get hot with it 

Now you dry snitchin, because you got knocked with it 

I just rock with it, go with the flow, think for a hot minute 

Stash my dough secure the funds of profit 

[Prodigy] 

Yo, extreme rhyme niggaz, you wastin your time 

Fuckin with my niggaz, extraordinary line swishin 

your mind out position, tryin to figure this shit 

Rewind it and listen quick, you might miss this 

Olympic, rap jave-lon, travel beyond, your weak song 

Doin this for too long, to not come strong 

You're only a pawn of Viet Dong 

Tryin to form against mines, you musta just been born 

Secluded on a distant farm 

This is the real world, where niggaz get shot and shanked 

Where there's tremendous pain, you get your frame inflamed 

Crushed to dust, by the next man's clutch 

It's Infamous you fucks, intense bad luck.. 

Chorus One 

Stand strong on our two feet, we all ready

Pull a sting like a yellow jacket makin maneuvers
Through the slums nigga iron lung ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to my torture chamber pen and pendulum

Foul play T two thousand be judgment day
Face millennium hell to pay
My knuckles soft from the star wars of han solo
South paw ring your bell like its quasimodo what is the law?

Stay hardcore my clan logo move to quick to catch a photo
Jettin' on land like jet motto now we lord on the conduit?
These niggaz actin like they beactinen' through it
As if the hardcore to the truest, I can't lose like Parker Lewis
Set in my ways

Got you corny niggaz askin' who is Johnny Blaze
Get a late pass stinkin' ass sucker ass
Now you sufferin' like succotash
While johnny cash is makin moves on your moneybags

I'm strict love stickin' hundreds in your honeys ass
My verbal bucket in the background
Holdin me down watching these clowns
As they eyeballin all day eyeballin in the mind

Gettin' high y'all, put it on the sky fold the night trol night
Rap infected get the Lysol to disinfect it
You don't know me or my fuckin method
That's the shit that made me tip

When I wrote a pitch how many leech it
Stapleton, the wild west park hill
Now borne jungle nils one more game hit me with
That shit they be smokin'
Got cali niggaz loc'in new york niggaz open
John hay phenomenon the megabomb
Transformed in a firearm like megatron

That's my word 
It ain't safe no more, no more bitch

Brain is punctured and drained through the nasal 
Hour of assassination be upon you

But I keep a lease for my, four-fifth automatic 
Extended clip rewind, bust mine, 
Anytime you reveal your snake is raising actions 
Observe the magnetic attraction

Tough act to follow, hard copy novel throw you off the Farasauno 
We swimmin with these sharks, yo I raked body guard 
Stamp my initial in your birthmark, P.L.O

Black expo, checks in afro, we back yo, 
Stole-a-might, crash your wind pipe, with the (right to right?) 
Fatal strike, daily mic fights, shoot-out street lights

Tight like a virgin, merging with my aye-a-like

Filthy, innocent till I'm proven guilty

I make thousands in the club with no shirts, go beserk 
From the Shao burrow, wylin out on the furlow 
Commando, style thorough, solo inferno 
It burns slow, thermal nuclear degrees 
Heads of underseas down to the youngest seeds 
Wannabes clone, they light like summer breeze 
Hundred G's for the garden, the fierce stampede 
From the die cast, hit the mic like the iron-palm blast 
Equipped to perform the task 
S-I-N-why, and what, had a gut 
The head rush, will cause your cerebellum to bust 

We be the world's most fabulous, hazardous, to fuck with these ravenous 
Killas get you stuck to the wall like wooden cabinets 
Extravagant, drop a helicopter high 
Up into the sky, lines philosophy 
Watch my pockets ride, to the bottom bus 
Confide in God and Sin, I trust the villianous 
Criminal minded killas rust 
I intend to build a fortifying man, 
Mastermind vying men, navigate the globe and retire quick 

Aiyyo fluid rap bend, through a black Veluga black act

Method Man,"Excuse me gorgeous..
Just maxin  lookin for hoes  why'know  relaxin
Met this redbone Jasmine  midtown Manhattan
Shot a verb  that tranked her nerves  calm words
Massaged the mentals  made her pussycat purr
Sweet Love you look miraculous  brown eyes passionate
High cheekboned  Tommy Girl cologne you smashin it
Jump in  take a spin  destination Staten
I have you home by ten, Shorty started laughin
She replied, ""Street, you ever ride while you drive?""
I looked puzzled, and said, ""Nah baby why?""
She pressed up, grabbed my dick, threw her dress up
Cocked her legs, cold fucked my head up
Now I'm deep in it, flyin past the speed limit
Out of control, still whippin it, steadily hittin it
Deep strokin, one hand on the wheel, blunt smokin
Lovin how it feel, Sweet Love you got me open, what?
Love is love Love, love is love Love
Love is love Love, love is love Love
We connected like a train from the first ordeal
I stepped to her with the passion as I kept things real
but like, sex was on my mind like, cum was in my pants
I flashed my fronts on her, like if I had a chance
She said, ""Ain't you Cappadonna from the Wu-Tang Clan?""
I said, ""Yeah, mad gear plus the small white band
Sweet Love, I want your pussy can I be your man?
Stripped to the bare essentials let me fuck you if I can
Sweet Love, from your nipples to your pussy nub""
Sweet Love, love is Love, love is love Love
It's a full moon, we in the bedroom, thoughts consumed
by the passion, slow jam tunes and body action
My finger's on the clit splashin, your pussy lips
got you spazzin, love juices, marinatin
in your satins, sexy ass, I get some like my old dad
I love my women bad, with just a little touch of class
Youse the Star by far, look at you Ma
Shake your thang-thang girlfriend, you SheShe Lefrea!
Whattup, went to beat it up, I'm not the one to eat it up
but the type to hit it raw dawg and seed it up
We talk without sayin nuttin, you told me if I came through
you'd gimme som'in, now we lockin ass
Pullin hair and talkin trash, how you like it
slow or fast? She said, ""I like it when it last""
No doubt, you got the best trout there can be
Not an everyday, average, Chicken of the Sea, candidate for H.I.V.
You'd rather deal with monogamy
Queen to be held, Black Mahogany
You're bout to bust damnit, sugar walls comin down
Now you can't stand it, you've been touched
That's when I felt the blood rush
Gettin closer and closer with every thrust, take me there
Volcano's about to erupt, I love you much

For Ducks and my pen's bleedin 

Leavin' kids barely breathin for sneak-thievin 

Famished from lack of eatin and lack of teachin 

Banished from Rhyme & Reason for high treason, can it be 

That the kid with the knot knees 

Got G to make a grown man cop pleas, for this track 

I got a Lovebug like Starsky, blow back 

Until I drop Tical Part 3, ain't no stoppin 

When you start me, John Jay 

Pullin your card, mayday mayday 

Niggaz owe they life to God, and now it's payday 

Take it how ya want to take it, fully clothed or butt-naked 

I learned the hard way - ain't nuttin sacred 

In this world - time to face it, Johnny Basic 

Instinct, I'm sure to make it 

While others fake it, fuck the spotlight, G-O-D already got light 

Say what you like, just spell my name right

Cake niggaz, keep my dick up out your mouth

Silent as a mouse on the set while everybody in the house slept

Find a butcher knife, cut the power lines to the lights
Now a nigga wild for the night
I come like the livin dead, straight from the dirt
Back to avenge his own death on this Earth
Ever hear of Jason, then you know my work
Down to the basement, the dog get it first
I can't help myself, my thoughts ain't my own
The voices in my head just won't leave me alone
Murda murda murda, kill kill kill
Pissing on the car seats, flattening the wheels
So there's no escape from the fate that awaits
No one to witness the horror taking place
Yeah, now I'm on my way up the stairs
To the bedroom of my prey unaware
Heads will be hung from the chimney with care
With hopes that the police soon will be here
I'm a killer
