Hank Garland,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a well remembered dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme",Third Man Theme
Hank Garland,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Hank Garland,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair. 

Scarlet ribbons, there's magic in the air. 
Scarlet, scarlet ribbons for her hair.",Scarlet Ribbons (For Her Hair)
Hank Jones,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love",Almost Like Being in Love
Hank Jones,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel
Hank Jones,"I get no kick from champagne,
Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

Some get a kick from cocaine,
I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Some get a kick in a plane,
Flying too high,
With some gal in the sky,
Is my idea of nothing to do,
But I get a kick out of you.
I get a kick, out of you.",Hank's Pranks
Hank Jones,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul
Hank Jones,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss",But Not for Me
Hank Jones,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,
It had to be you, wonderful you,
It had to be you.

It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.

For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still.

It had to be you, wonderful you

It had to be you.",It Had to Be You
Hank Jones,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Hank Jones,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love
Hank Jones,"I often wonder why he came to me
Brought such a flame to me

And let it die
And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye

With every new love you
Will come back to me
In others eyes, its you I see
If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

If I love again
I'll find other charms
But I'll make believe, you are in my arms
And though my lips whisper

""I love you""
My heart will not be true
I'll be loving
Every time I love again",If I Love Again
Hank Jones,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes
Hank Jones,"Oh she may be weary
Them young girls they do get wearied
Wearing that same old miniskirt dress
But when she gets weary
You try a little tenderness

Oh man that
Un hunh
I know shes waiting
Just anticipating
The thing that you'll never never possess
No no no
But while she there waiting

Try just a little bit of tenderness
That's all you got to do
Now it might be a little bit sentimental no
But she has her greavs and care
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle
Yeah yeah yeah
And it makes it easier to bear
Oh she wont regret it

No no
Them young girls they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Yeah yeah yeah
But its all so easy
All you got to do is try
Try a little tenderness
Yeah
Damn that hart (hard?)

All you got to do is know how to love her
You've got to
Hold her
Squeeze her
Never leave her
Now get to her
Got got got to try a little tenderness
Yeah yeah
Lord have mercy now

All you got to do is take my advice
You've got to hold her
Don't squeeze her
Never leave her
You've got to hold her
And never
So you got to try a little tenderness

Hank Jones,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Hank Jones,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you",Love Walked In [Take 1][#][*]
Hank Jones,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love
Hank Jones,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere

Hank Jones,"Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine
 
Everything is set, skies are blue,

Hank Jones,"Driftin' Dreamin'
In an Azure mood,
Stardust gleamin' 
Thru my solitude:
Here in my seclusion, 
You're a blue illusion 
While I'm in this Azure interlude.

Always haunted
By the dreams I own;
But, though Im tormented
I must be contented

Hank Jones,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary
Hank Jones,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,

I can't see anyone but you

I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky

Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.

Her teeth are bright and pearly and her hair is black as jet
Her lips are sweet as honey and her heart is true I know

And her heart beats true for him and him alone

I've come back to claim the only girl I love
And that night there was a wedding while the ships crew gathered round
And he wed his little Filipino baby

Hank Locklin,"Harbor lights are ahead and bright they're shining I can feel the thrill of coming home
But I know my heart will not be willing to forget a foreign love I've known
I will soon be in the arms that waited faithfully each day that I've been gone
But my heart could never be contented to forget a foreign love I've known
[ guitar ]
What on earth could be the right decision it's no good to find a memory
Should I tell the one that calls me darling that a foreign love is haunting me
Can I live with one and love another and go on and face what is to be
In the sea of dreams my heart is anchored and the foreign love is haunting me




",Foreign Love
Hank Locklin,"I wonder how many poor boys like me are still in love with a foreign memory
And how many poor girls are waiting over there
With their hearts tied to a foreign love affair
Foreign love affairs distant lands apart foreign love affairs many broken hearts

I'd give up a kingdom if I were a king to be with my darling and have one golden ring

Hank Locklin,"I close my eyes and picture the emerald of the sea
From the fishing boats at Dingle to the shores of Dunardee
I miss the river Shannon and the folks at Skibbereen
The midlands and the moorlands with their forty shades of green
But most of all I miss the girl in Tipperary town
And most of all I miss her arms and hair so long and brown
Again I want to see and do the things we've done and seen
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar and there's forty shades of green

I wish that I could spend an hour at Dublin's churching surf
I'd love to watch the farmers drain the bogs and spade the turf

But most of all I miss the girl in Tipperary town

Hank Locklin,"A chain of steel a wall of stone could not keep me from you
But while your finger wears a ring of gold what can I do
I'm burning up with love but still I'm left out in the cold
Because you wear a yellow band of fourteen karat gold
I never should have let my heart go roaming by itself
But it gets awful lonesome when your heart sets on the shelf
I should have tied it with a string so it could be controlled
To stay away from a yellow band of fourteen karat gold
[ guitar - piano ]
I realize that I was wrong that I was all to blame
If there's a ring upon her finger never fan the flame
I'm ready now to pay the price of loving much too bold

Lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine

Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine

Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind

Hank Locklin,"If you ever go across the sea to Ireland,
Then maybe at the closing of your day,
You will sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay.
Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream,
The women in the meadows making hay
And to sit beside a turf fire in a cabin
And watch the barefoot gosoons at their play.
For the breezes blowing o'er the sea to Ireland,
are perfumed by the heather as they blow.
And the women in the uplands digging praties
Speak a language that the strangers do no know.
For the strangers came and tried to teach us their ways,
And scorned us just for being what we are
But they might as well be chasing after moonbeams
Or light a penny candle from a star
And if there's going to be a life hereafter,
And somehow I am sure there's going to be,
I will ask my God to let me make my heaven
In that dear land across the Irish Sea.",Galway Bay

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair

For it looks so peaceful there""

And if it's wrong to love the way I love you I sin each time I kiss your paper face

Since the day you walked away with my heart
A million tears have trickled from my eyes

I may be wealthy with more than my share
I may be able to go anywhere
I may own a kingdom and sit on a throne
Still I'll be lonely while I'm livin' alone

I can follow the bright lights
Keep a smile on my face
I can travel this whole world
But not get any place

I need you near me to stick by my side
Please give me true love and don't shatter my pride
If you should leave me all the dreams I have known
Will never come true while I'm livin' alone

Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face

Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

An' it's hangin' in the air like the mississippi heat

Well here comes the train an' boy is she smokin'
Headed out from new orleans 'n' clear to l.a.

Hank Marvin,"You ask me how much I need you, must I explain?
I need you, oh my darling, like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you, I'll tell you true
Until the Twelfth of Never, I'll still be loving you

	Hold me close, never let me go
	Hold me close, melt my heart like April snow

I'll love you 'til the bluebells forget to bloom
I'll love you 'til the clover has lost its perfume
I'll love you 'til the poets run out of rhyme

Hank Marvin,"Heart beat why do you miss when my baby kisses me?

Heart beat why does a love kiss stay in my memory?
Pitity-pat, I know that new love thrills me
I know that true love will be

Heart beat why do you miss when my baby kisses me?

Heart beat why do you skip when my baby's lips meet mine?
Heart beat why do you flip then give me a skip beat sign?
Pitity-pat , and sing to me love stories
And bring to me love's glory

Heart beat why do you miss when my baby kisses me?",Heartbeat
Hank Marvin,"I danced in the morning when the world was begun,
I dance in the moon and the stars and the sun,
I came down from Heaven and I danced on earth,
At Bethlehem I had my birth.

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,
""And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,"" said he.

I danced for the scribe and the Pharisee,
They would not dance, they wouldn't follow me.
So I danced for the fishermen,
James and John came with me and the dance went on.

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,
""And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,"" said he.

I danced on the Sabbath and I cured the lame,
The Holy people said it was a shame.
They whipped and they stripped and they hung me high,
Left me there on a cross to die.

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,
""And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,"" said he.

I danced on a Friday when the sky turned black,
It's hard who dance with the devil on your back.
They buried my body, they thought I'd gone,
But I am the dance, and I still go on.

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,
""And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,"" said he.

They cut me down, but I lept up high.
""I am the life that'll never never die
And I'll live in you if you'll live in me.
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he.

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,

Recalling all the terror I feel about this night

Tell me that I'm dreaming, I hear them call my name

My body's aching, the dogs are on my trail

Fires burn, heart beats strong,
Sing out loud, the chain gang song,

Hank Marvin,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Could'nt stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying ev'rything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days my mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world
They were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be,
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

[Chorus]

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more
I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me
To know that every word is true

Perfect situations must go wrong 
But this has never yet prevented me 
From wanting far too much for far too long 
Looking back, I could have done it differently 
Won a few more moments, who can tell? 
But it took time to understand the man 
Now at least I know, I know him well 

Wasn't it good, Wasn't it fine 
Isn't it madness he can't be mine 
But in the end, he needs a little more than before 
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom 
I know him so well 

No one in your life is with you constantly 
No one is completely on your side 
And though I move my world to be with him 
Still the gap between us is too wide 
Looking back, I could have played it differently 
Learned about the man before I fell 
But I was ever so much younger then 

Wasn't it good (oh so good), Wasn't it fine (so fine) 
Isn't it madness he can't be mine 

Didn't I know how it would go 
If I knew from the start 
Why am I falling apart 

Wasn't it fine 
Isn't it madness he can't be mine

I'm amazed, for I'm only an actress 

I'm amazed, for I'm only a soldier
nothing to shout about one of the thousands
only a girl on the air. defending the country we love.

But when you act, the things you do affect us all.

But when you act, you take us away
from the squalor of the real world.
Are you here on your own?

Yes, oh yes.

So am I. What a fortunate coincidence.
Maybe you're my reward for my efforts here tonight.

It seems crazy, but you must believe
there's nothing calculated, nothing planned.
Please forgive me if I seem naive
I would never want to force your hand,
but please understand, I'd be good for you.
I don't always rush in like this
twenty seconds after saying hello

If I'm wrong, I hope you'll tell me so
But you really should know, I'd be good for you
I'd be surprisingly good for you.
I won't go on if I'm boring you
but do you understand my point of view?
Do you like what you hear, what you see,
and would you be good for me, too?
I'm not talking of a hurried night

creeping home before it gets too light

which has to imply I'd be good for you

Hank Marvin,"Oh what a circus, oh what a show
Argentina has gone to town
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron
We've all gone crazy
Mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right

Oh what an exit, that's how to go
When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron
It's quite a sunset
And good for the country in a roundabout way
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today

But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?

She had her moments, she had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the casa rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""
But that's all gone now
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

Salve regina mater misericordiae
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
Salve salve regina
Ad te clamamus exules filii eva
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes

Hail, oh queen, mother of mercy
Our life, sweetness, and hope
Hail, hail, oh queen
To you we cry, exiled sons of eve
To you we sigh, mourning and weeping
Oh clement, oh loving one

You let down your people Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for
But in the end you could not deliver

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
And she's not coming back to you

Show business kept us all alive
Since seventeen October 1945
But the star has gone, the glamor's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in

Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much, but she said it loud

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
She's not coming back to you

'Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep,
Is there somewhere you can tell me?'

Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh think twice, it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh think twice, it's just another day for you,

Hank Mobley,"I dim all the lights and I sink in my chair.
The smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air.
The walls of my room fade away in the blue,
And I'm deep in a dream of you.

The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend;
You come to my arms, may this bliss never end,
For we love anew just as we used to do
When I'm deep in a dream of you.

Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing,
We glide through a lover's refrain, you're so appealing
That I'm soon revealing my love for you over again.

My hand isn't hurt, but there's pain in my heart.
Awake or asleep, ev'ry mem'ry I'll keep
Deep in a dream of you.",Deep in a Dream

Hank Snow,"In the Dodge City yards of the Sante Fe
Stood a freight made up for the east
And the engineer with his oil and waste
Was groomin' the great iron beast;

While ten cars back in the murky dust
A box-car door swung wide
And a hobo lifted his pal aboard
To start on his last, long ride;

A lantern swung and the freight pulled out
The engine it gathered speed
The engineer pulled the throttle wide
And clucked to his fiery steed;

Ten cars back in the empty box
The hobo rolled a pill
The flare of the match showed his partners' face
Stark white and deathly still;

As the train wheels clicked on the couplin' joints
A song for the ramblers' ears
The hobo talked to the still, white form
His pal for many a year;

For a mighty long time we've rambled, Jack
With the luck of men that roam
With the back door steps for a dining room
And the boxcar for a home;

We dodged the bulls on the eastern route
And the cops on the Chesapeake
We traveled the Leadville Narrow Gauge
In the days of Cripple Creek; 

We drifted down through sunny Cal
On the rails of the old S. P.
And of all you had, through good and bad
A half always belonged to me; 

You made me promise to you, Jack
If I lived and you cashed in
To take you back to the old churchyard
And bury you there with your kin;

You seemed to know I would keep my word
For you said that I was wise
Well, I'm keepin my promise to you, pal
Cause I'm takin' you home tonight;

I hadn't the money to send you there
So I'm takin' you back on the 'fly'
It's the decent way for a Bo to go
Home to the by and by; 

I knew that fever had you, Jack
And that doctor just wouldn't come
He was too busy treatin' the wealthy folks
To doctor a worn out bum;

Straight through to the east it sped

Locked me to a ball and chain

A lonely spot I know 
Where no man will go 
Where the shadows have all the room

I was ridin' free on this old SP 
Humming a southern tune
When a man came along 
Made me hush my song 

Kicked me off way out there
As she pulled out of sight 
I turned to the right 
The left and everywhere

But all I could see 
Was a cactus tree 
And a prairie dog playin' there
I watched the prairie dog 

Feed on the tumbleweed 
That's his home way out there
So I threw down my load 
In the desert road 

Rested my weary legs too
I watched the sinking sun 
Make the tall shadows run 
Out across that barren plain

Then I hummed a tune 
To the risin' moon 
He gets lonesome way out there
So I closed my eyes 

To the starlit skies 
And lost myself in dreams
I dreamed the desert sand 
Was a milk and honey land 

Then I awoke with a start
As she was passin' by 
I caught her on the fly 
Climbed in an open door

Then I turned around 
To that desert ground 
Saw the spot I would see no more
As I was ridin' away 

I heard the pale moon say

And the north wind came howling down the line
With his sweetheart so dear stood a brave engineer
With his orders to pull old No 9
She kissed him goodbye with a tear in her eye
But the joy in his heart he could not hide
Oh the whole world seemed bright when she told him that night
That tomorrow she'd be his blushing bride
Oh the wheels hummed a song as the train rolled along
And the black smoke came pouring from the stack
And the headlight agleam seemed to brighten his dream
Of tomorrow when he'd be coming back
He steered around the hill and his brave heart stood still
For a headlight was shining in his face
And he whispered a prayer as he drew on the air
Or he knew this would be his final grace
In the wreck he was found lying there on the ground
And he asked them to raise his weary head
As his breath slowly went this the message he sent

I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All alone I bear the shame I'm a number not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
All I do is sit and cry when the evening train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I'll be locked here in this cell till my body's just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than the snow
I'll never see that gal of mine Lord I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard that lonesome whistle blow",(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle

While a tear he shed to his wife he said just have two lanterns trimmed
Just hang a light as I pass tonight hang it where it can be seen
If our baby's dead just show the red if she's better then show the green

In a little house by the railroad track a mother with watchful eye
Saw a gleam of hope and a feeble smile as the train went rushing by

On your waves of golden hue, you carried her with you
And broke my heart a million, million ways.

While I watch the moon climb slowly in the sky.
It was on a night like this when she gave me her last kiss
Climbed in her birch canoe and sailed away.

I married someone else not you?
I I thougt I'd spied you there that day.

Has loved me faithfully.

Hank Snow,"You put your heart upon an auction block and sold it,
Selfish greed and envy were the auctioneers.
The highest bidder won your heart but he can't hold it;
Love that's bought with gold can only end in tears.

The price I offered was my true love and devotion,
But you laughed and said that love had had its day
When at your feet I laid a heart filled with emotion,
You scorned the only price that I could pay.

May the golden price he paid you for your love, dear,
Keep you with him, may you never drift apart;
'Cause at the auction of regrettal, tears are worthless,
Bids are low for second-handed broken hearts.

When you tire of playin' princess, you'll recall
That love alone is life's true everlasting treasure,
And my bid, it was the highest after all.",The Highest Bidder
Hank Snow,"Riding on an East-bound freight train, speeding through the night
Hobo Bill, a railroad bum, was fighting for his life... 
The sadness of his eyes revealed the torture of his soul 
He raised a weak and weary hand to brush away the cold. 

Ho-ho-o Bo-o-o Bil-lie! 

No warm lights flickered around him, no blankets there to fold 
Nothing but, the howling wind and the driving rain, so cold 
When he heard a whistle blowing, in a dreamy kind of way 
The hobo seemed contented for he smiled there where he lay. 

Ho-ho-o Bo-o-o Bil-lie! 

Outside the rain was fallin' on that lonesome boxcar door 
But the little form of Hobo Bill lay still upon the floor 
As the train sped through the darkness and the raging storm outside 
No one knew that Hobo Bill was taking his last ride. 

It was early in the mornin' when they raised the hobo's head 
The smile still lingered on his face, but Hobo Bill was dead 
There was no mother's longin', to soothe his weary soul 
For he was just a railroad bum, who died out in the cold.",Hobo Bill's Last Ride

Love dreams that faded away.
Too many teardrops have fallen,
Too many vows cast aside.

For us in the chapel tonight,
But this morning they tolled,
And her bright band of gold
Was returned with this message tonight

Your sweetheart has left today,
Heart broken, God took her away.
That silk gown of white for her wedding tonight,
She wore as they laid her away.
Tho' she died for a love all in vain,
Her last words were calling your name;
As I walked to her grave where the blue bonnets wave,
I cried but my tears were too late.

Tonight, sweetheart, as I kneel here alone beside you
And my tears stain the flowers on your grave,
In deep regret I think of the heart that I have wounded
Of the sorrow, and grief, and the life I could have saved.
Yes, tonight darling, you were to be my loving bride
But all that I have left now as I bow to pray,
Is your ring, a picture, the sad message that they sent me,
And this rose that I am taking from your grave.",I Cried But My Tears Were Too Late

And my bud of love has closed, I have lost the only rose

On my broken heart that love has cast away.

You're counting my mistakes, how about yours?
Why do you sentence me to nights of tears?
Convicting all these dreams I've dreamed for years?

Hank Snow,"My cowboy life is so happy and free
Out west where the laws don't bother me
I take my troubles like a toy
I'm just a yodeling cowboy

At the set of the sun
When my work is done
On my pony I take a ride
Where the coyotes howl
And the varmits prowl
With my forty-four by my side

I go down that lonesome trail
Just galloping long
I love to sing my yodeling
Cowboy song

Where a man is a man
And a friend is a friend
Where all my cares and worries end
I have no troubles, nothing but joy

Hank Snow,"I love a gal who invented kissin' I don't recall her name
But I do believe that gal should sit high up in the hall of fame
Until she came along just think what we were missin'
That's why today I'm shouting hooray for the gal who invented kissin'

She thought the fellows how to smooth instead of holdin' hands
And she showed them how to steel a kiss like they do in foreign lands
Until she came along just think what they were missin'
Loved was very nice but as cold as ice to that gal who invented kissin'

She showed the girls how pucker up and roll their pretty eyes
And she showed them how to kiss hello and how to kiss goodbye
Until she came along just think what they were missin'
They could only cook or read a book till that gal who invented kissin'

Mr Edison he invented the lights Mr Bell the telephone
And Columbus found America their names're all well known
But till she came along this world had somethin' missin'
And I'm tellin' you there was nothin' to do till that gal invented kissin'

Now I've been out with a many a gal and the things all were so nice
Some of them I kissed just once and other more than twice
But if I had my wish the only thing I'm wishin'
Is to make a date and stay out late with the gal who invented kissin'

She ever knows how to kiss so fire and how to kiss goodnight
On every kind of hug and kiss she holds a copy rhyme
But if I had my wish the only thing I'm wishin'
Is to make a date and stay out late with the gal who invented kissin'",The Gal Who Invented Kissin'
Hank Snow,"From old Montana down to Alabam' I've been before and I'll travel again
You triflin' women can't keep a good man down
You dealt the cards but you missed a play so hit the road and be on your way
Goin' board the Golden Rocket and leave this town

I was a good engine a runnin' on time but baby I'm switchin' to another line
So honey never hang your signal out for me
I'm tired of runnin' on the same old track
Bought a one way ticket and I won't be back

This Golden Rocket's gonna roll my blues away
Hear that lonesome whistle blow that's your cue and by now you know
That I got another true lover waitin' in Tennessee
This midnight special is a burnin' the rail so woman don't try to follow my trail

This Golden Rocket's gonna blow my blues away
Hear her thunder on through the night this Golden Rocket is a doin' me right
And that sunny old southland sure is a part of me
Now from your call board erase my name your fire went out you done lost your flame

And this Golden Rocket is rollin' my blues away
That old conductor he seemed to know you done me wrong I was feelin' low
For he yelled aloud we're over that Dixon Line
The brakeman started singin' a song said you're worried now but it won't be long

This Golden Rocket is leavin' your blues behind
Then the porter yelled with his southern drawl let's rise and shine good mornin' ya all
And I sprang to my feet to greet the new born day
When I kissed my baby in the station door the whistle blew like it never before
Of the Golden Rocket that rolled my blues away",The Golden Rocket

Means your true-lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
Cause I'm movin'on, I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high, for my little old sky
So I'm movin' on.

That big loud whistle, as it blew and blew
Said hello to the southland, we're comin' to you
And we're movin' on, oh, hear my song
You had the laugh on me, so I set you free
And I'm movin' on.

Mister fireman, won't you please listen to me
Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll
And keep movin' me on.

Mister Engineer, take that throttle in hand
This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
To keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
You gonna ease my mind, put me there on time
And keep rollin' on.

I've told you baby, from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
You've broken your vow, and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on.

You've switched your engine, now I ain't got time
For a triflin' woman on my main line
Cause I'm movin' on, you done your daddy wrong
I warned you twice, now you can settle the price
Cause I'm movin' on.

But someday baby, when you've had your play

Do you vow to love her the rest of your life
And will you protect her and honor her name
Oh don't cause her heartaches and don't bring her shame
Share with her in poverty with her in wealth
For richer for poorer through sickness and health
All these things the Parson did ask me and then I whispered I do and I'd do it again

For I really love her the one I call wife and I'll go on caring the rest of my life
I'd die to protect her and she'd do the same
I'd cut off my tongue before I'd bring her shame

But all that you left her were heartaches and tears)
So kiss her old brow whisper softly and true
Mother you're just an angel and I love you

On the door of a cottage a wreath sadly hung
And a hearse stood there awaiting as the choir softly sung
There were flowers in their beauy and the old Parson he prayed
This was the last tribute as we left for her grave
She won't meet you tonight son when you crave her caress
She has reared you to manhood and now you've laid her to rest
Those flowers in their beauty ah to her they're unknown
Cause tonight she's with the angels up around God's great throne
So don't wait that late son to try and repay
Give those flowers and give those treasures but give them today
Let her know that you love her and kinda show that you care
Cause she's your mother God love her she's as true as a prayer

Hank Snow,"Well come all you children give a listen to me let me tell you bout a new boogie beat
There's no hesitation it's sweepin' the nation
It's the Rhumba Boogie down the South American way
While Madame Lozonga was teachin' La Conga in her little cabana in old Havana
We were doing the charleston and Ballin' the Jack
Then that old black bottom till they started the Jitterbug rag
Then across the water came Cuban Pete he started the boogie to the Rhumba Beat
It's the Rhumba Boogie let's give it a whirl
While he plays the Boogie in the South American style

Count one two three then put your right foot down
Then you circle your lady as you swing and you sway

Yells do you stuff it's the best in the land
It's the Rhumba Boogie let's dance it a while
To the boogie woogie done the Rhumba Cuban all style
When that old piano it starts to ring everybody then starts to sing
To the Rhumba Boogie done the tropical style
It's the Rhumba Boogie and they're doin' it all of the while

While Madame Lozonga was teachin' La Conga in her little cabana in old Habana
The folks in old Mexico where doin' the tango
And we were steppin' to the rhythm of an old guitar

Hank Snow,"I met a girl in Laredo down in Mexico
While I was makin' the rounds
Down in a dim cafe she does the swing and sway
That's the talk of the town
I never learned her name
But she's called the Spanish Fireball

While she kept rhythm with her hips
From her ruby lips came a love song so bright
And as she rumbaed by the fire in her eyes
Looked like flames in the night
T'was then I understood why she's called
The Spanish Fireball

I finally asked her for a dance
And I got the chance holding her closely to me
While we were cheek to cheek I grew too weak to speak
And it was plain to see
That I had fallen in love with this
Cute little Spanish Fireball

She wore a ruby bracelet and a blue white diamond
Upon her little brown hand
She made a perfect date and in her Cadillac eight
Love began to expand
I played the part and gave my heart to
The Spanish Fireball

We wandered out beneath the stars
While the old guitars strummed a Mexican tune
And as I stole a kiss I knew too well that this
Would all end too soon
'Cause I must go away and leave
My Spanish Fireball

As that old moon was sinkin' low
I heard the whistle blow my train was pulling in sight
And so we kissed goodbye
The tears were in her eyes as I left in the night
But someday I 'll go back and claim
My Spanish Fireball",Spanish Fireball

A vow and now that moment so divine.
With this ring I Thee wed, and make you mine forever
To have and to hold until the end of time.

Would you mind if I take you home to meet my folks?
Would you mind laughin’ at my Daddy’s same old jokes?
And if Ma says, ""Son, you have found the one""

Would you care if I got my camera and took
A picture of you for my picture book?
If I wanna show the guys who I idolize
Would you mind, would you mind, would you mind?

Would you be down-hearted if I up and started
With some big romancin’, lots of dates and dancin’?
If I kinda mention that it’s my intention
To be goin’ steady, would you be ready?

Would you mind if I tell you you’re the cutest thing?
Would you mind goin’ shoppin’ for a wedding ring?

the Danube is not blue.

It's green as a bean.
It ain't not serene.
And though the blueberry looks a little purple,
And though your maple syrup looks a little murple,
Don't believe what you have heard or you have saw.
Oh the Danube isn't blue, it's green.
Oh, the Danube is green as the grass in the spring
It's as green as the dollar you spend on a fling.
It's as green as the paint that you put on the screen.
Oh the blue of the Danube is greener than green.

My mother is in heaven,
Where God and the angels smile;

Her lonely orphan child.

And had a happy home;
Till dad, he went to drinking rum,
And then he gambled some;
He left my darling mother,

And as I tell my story,
I see your tear-drops start.

Don't weep for me and mother,

And save my poor lonely dad;

Without a thought of worry or of care,
When I saw the postman coming up the pathway,
With such a happy look and jolly air.

As I heard the postman whistling yester morning,
Coming down the pathway with his pack,
Oh he little knew the sorrow that he brought me
When he handed me that letter edged in black.

Oh, he rang the bell and whistled while he waited,
And then he said ""Good morning to you, Jack.""
But he little knew the sorrow that he brought me
When he handed me that letter edged in black.

With trembling hand I took the letter from him,
I broke the seal and this is what it said:
""Come home, my boy, your dear old father wants you!
Come home, my boy, your dear old mother's dead!""

""The last words that your mother ever uttered 
'Tell my boy I want him to come back,'

That sunrise serenade",Sunrise Serenade
Hank Snow,"There's nothing left for me of days that used to be
There's just a memory among my souvenirs

Some letters tied in blue, a photograph or two
I see a rose from you among my souvenirs

A few more tokens rest within my treasure chest
And though they do their best to give me consolation

I count them all apart and as the teardrops start
I find a broken heart among my souvenirs

Hank Snow,"Beautiful Dreamer, wake unto me,
Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee;
Sounds of the rude world heard in the day,
Lull'd by the moonlight have all pass'd away!
Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song,
List while I woo thee with soft melody;
Gone are the cares of life's busy throng
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!

Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea,
Mermaids are chaunting the wild lorelie;
Over the streamlet vapors are borne,
Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn.
Beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart,
E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea;
Then will all clouds of sorrow depart,
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!",Beautiful Dreamer
Hank Snow,"In the twilight glow I see her
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again

Love is like a dying ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages I remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Someday when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Now my hair is turned to silver
all my tears I've shed in vain
I can  see her star in heaven
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Hank Snow,"Recorded by Hank Snow
Born to lose, I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you.
Born to lose, it seems so hard to bear
How I long to always have you near
You've grown tired and now you say we're through
Born to lose and now I'm losing you.
Born to lose, my every hope is gone
It's so hard to face that empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew
Born to lose and now I'm losing you.
There's no use to dream of happiness
All I see is only loneliness

Hank Snow,"My troubled old heart dear is beating with pain,
You've gone and I know I'm the one who's to blame,
You've gone in the world to make a new start,
And left as a memory your brand on my heart.

They say you were crying while packing your things
And left me your locket and bright golden rings,
The plans for your future I've broken apart
Now all I have left is your brand on my heart.

You say you were sorry it ended this way
And that I'll find someone to love me someday,
Another to cherish the love you once knew,
But darling that someone can only be you.

The flowers you planted, that rose you loved best
It's soft velvet petals are now closed in death
The birds have hushed singing, it all plays a part
To deepen the wound of your brand on my heart.

I'm appealing to you for forgiveness today
For all of your tears darling I've had to pay,
If you'll just forgive me we'll make a new start
And no more will I carry your brand on my heart.",Brand on My Heart
Hank Snow,"Within my prison cell so dreary
I sit alone with achin' heart
I'm dreamin' of my little darlin'
From her forever, I must part

The rose she sent me as a token
She sent it just to lighten my gloom
And tell me that her heart was broken
And cheer me before I meet my doom

She wrote I picked it from the garden, 
Where once we wandered side by side. 
Now you hold no hope of pardon, 
And I can never be your bride. 

The judge would not believe my story
The jury said I had to pay
And with the rose in all its glory
""Not guilty"" was all that I could say

Goodbye, sweetheart, for in the morning
To meet my Maker I must go
And when I die at daylight's dawnin'
Against my heart they'll find this rose

Gone are the vows that we made by the stars
Gone like a bolt from the blue;
Darlin I'm lost at the end of the world
But what good am I without you?
Now yesterday's love is an old memory
Leaving me so heartsick and so blue;
But where can I turn at the end of the world

That he wouldn't follow the footsteps of his dad
I have searched both far & wide
& I feared that he had died
But at last I've found my baby here in jail
Oh warden, at last I've found my baby here in jail""

""It was just 5 years today
When his daddy passed away
He was found beneath the snow so cold & white
'Twas then I vowed to take his ring
And his gold watch & his chain
And the county laid his daddy in the grave
Yes warden, the county laid his daddy in the grave""

""I will pawn you his watch
I will pawn you his chain
I will pawn you my diamond wedding ring
I will wash all your clothes
I will scrub all your floors
If that will get my baby out of jail
Yes warden, if that will get my baby out of jail""

Then I heard the warden say
To the lady old & gray:
""I'll go bring your darlin' baby to your side""

She held her darlin' to her heart
She kissed her baby boy & then she died

I may be wild 
I may be tough and out of style

When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old Shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and then pulled me out

As the years fast did roll
Old Shep he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can do no more for your dog

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

He came to my side
And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

Where the good doggies go
And no more with old Shep will I roam

On this cold war with you
Tho' you don't speak
And I won't speak it's true

Why, oh, why should love ever come
To couples, like you and me
Whose cold, cold wars are never done
And whose hearts just can't be free

So let's make up
Or let's just say we're through
I just can't stand another

But I don't care 
I'm goin' down

Which most dream folks always attend
And just inside 
There's a little path 
That leads towards the rainbow's end

And down at the end 
There's a sign that reads 
Love that will never die
Now no one can travel 
Up the path 
No one but you and I

How I wish the little gate 
Will open and that you might walk with me
Down to the end of that rainbow 
To the sign on that old oak tree
And how I wish that your arms 
Would hold me and that your lips 
Might touch mine too
Cause I can't travel 
Up that path

Say we can only stay for just a minute 
And we must never go back there again

And if you stay awhile you'll soon like their style of rhythm
You'll learn the Cuba Rhumba the dance that everyone does
And when you dance with the sweet senorita you meet in the moonlight
You'll forget way of prom and you'll never want to come home
And in a tropical way you'll learn how to say manana
And the Cuba Rhumba will have you under its spell
If you'll hear Spanish guitars out under the stars in Cuba
While the dancers are swayin' as long as I'm playin' tune
And if you're tappin' your feet in the beat of that native music
Then the Cuba Rhumba has got you under its spell
Beneath the tropical sky you'll be tryin' to step to the rhythm
And you'll shout all day in the way the native all do
And then you'll walk in a trance and just want to dance to Rhumba
Yes the Cuba Rhumba will have you under its spell",Cuba Rhumba
Hank Snow,"Way out in Honolulu
Just at the close of day
I heard a sailor sing
Unto a dusky maid
Just as his ship slowly sailed away

Because I'm coming back you know
Don't sing aloha tho' I cry
Our parting does not mean goodbye

I'll dream of you in Waikiki
That's where I'll always long to be
Just smile and say you'll miss me so

I'm wishing and longing for you and for home

I'm climbin' that old hill headin' that way

And I wish it could be down that old road to home
With a troubled mind and a heart full of pain
I've searched this whole world for fortune and fame
But I'm longing to be with you once again
So we could go strolling down old mem'ry lane

Not very far from an old sawmill

With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman was a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know how he come to life one day
There must have been some magic in that old silk that they found
For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun now before I melt away
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town right up to the traffic cop

Then maybe at the closing of the day
You will sit and watch the moon rise over forest
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay
Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream 
The women in the meadows making hay
And to sit beside a turn fire in the cabin
And watch the barefoot cousins at their play
(For the strangers came and tried to teach us fairway
They scorn us just for being what we are
But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams 
Or buy a penny candle from a star)

And somehow I am sure there's going to be

The wind it did whistle and the waters did roar
I heard of fair maiden make a pitiful sound
It sounded so lonesome in the waters around

I never will marry I'll be no man's wife
I expect to live single all the days of my life

My love's gone and left me the one I adore
She's gone where I'll never see her anymore
She plunged her fair body in the waters so deep
She closed her pretty blue eyes in the waters to sleep

I never will marry I'll be no man's wife
I expect to live single all the days of my life

The shells in the ocean shall be my death bed
The fish in deep water swim over my head

When the wicked had all forgotten God
Brother Noah, built a boat, which above
God's wrath did float

And the people saw that they were made of mud
As the doors swang open and gang plank standing out.
Noah and his family entered with a shout.
As the scorners stretched their necks,

Noah stepped out on the deck
Saying, I'm so glad I'm on the inside looking out.

Oh I'd rather be on the inside looking out
Than to be on the outside looking in 
When the rain began to fall, sinners on the 
Lord did call
The door was shut and night was setting in.

Gazed to heaven beyond the water spout.
And he said I thank the Lord that I took Him 
at His word.

Good old Daniel lived in Babylon long ago
And he had the grace to tell the devil no.

Do they wander side by side,
And do their dreams into the future wind,
Do they still recall the day when she turned to him to say,
Darling take my hand and let's pretend.

So long since I have written
Since as a kid in happy house I dwelled
I've moved from there and now I live 
On disillusion avenue
And I've been here longer than I care to tell

The twinkling bells of hope and joy
The laughter that rang in my voice
Have silenced more and more as time goes by
Those treasured gifts from other years
Are tarnished, lost or stained with tears
So Santa would you bring a new supply

I'll be hanging up my empty heart this Christmas
Please fill it full with love and hope and cheer
My faith is gone, my courage low, my patience ran out long ago
Dear Santa Claus I need so much this year

Bring a basket of forgetfulness to cover up the bitterness
And the grudges that I've gathered through the years
And leave a large bag of forgiveness
To give out to those who robbed me 
Of my laughter that sometimes filled my eyes with tears
And Santa please a box piled high with love and understanding
That I could share with all my neighbors and my friends
And leave one new temper cause I lost mine
Lost it one too many times
And make the new one longer if you can

I'll be hanging up my empty heart this Christmas
Please fill it full with love and hope and cheer
Tuck in some smiles to give away and some to wear for every day
Dear Santa Claus I need so much this year 

Please Santa fill my empty heart this year",A Letter to Santa Claus
Hank Snow,"Would you like to hear the story of 
A girl that many soldiers know
It's a tale of love and all its glory 
They tell when the lights are soft and low
Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate
Standing all alone every night you see her wait
She waits for the boy who marched away 
And though he's gone she hears him say
""Oh promise you'll be true fare thee well Lili Marlene till I'll return to you
Fare thee well Lili Marlene""
With the kiss she gave her promise 
To be constant as the stars up above
Every soldier knows she kept her promise 
And she has been faithful to her love
(Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate
Standing all alone every night you see her wait
For this is the place a vow was made and breezes sing her serenade)
Oh promise you'll be true fare Thee well Lily Marlene till I'll return to you
Fare Thee well Lily Marlene

Although each tale must have an ending 
No one knows just what the end will be
But tonight when twilight is descending 
If you'll come along here's what you'll see
Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate
Standing all alone every night you see her wait
And as they go marching to the prey 
The soldiers all salute and say
""We'll tell him you've been true. 
Fare thee well Lili Marlene till he returns to you
Fare thee well Lili Marlene""",Lili Marlene

Hank Snow,"I saved up my money to buy my sweetheart some flowers
For Saturday's date and I restlessly counted the hours
Then today in the mail I received a short little note
And I broke down inside at the message that her mother's wrote
Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
We're leaving for Europe next week she'll be busy till then
They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plans
Goodbye true love goodbye my sweet Mary Ann
The weeks have gone by not a word have I heard since then
In the papers I read of the far away places she's been
I can't eat I can't sleep for over and over again
My mind reads that letter and I cry for my Mary Ann
My Mary Ann died they said she just wasted away
If I could have seen her I know she'd be living today
For we loved each other and if they had left us alone
Today she'd be wearing my ring not a blanket of stone

Hank Snow,"Once I got a foolish notion to cross that big wide ocean
The future for me didn't look so bright
So I signed up with a tanker got on board and raised the anchor
Stood and watched the Golden Gate fade out of sight
Nineteen days and nights we traveled through the stormy seas we battled
Till we land again Australia far away
Far from friends and San Francisco and the Miss I thought I miss so
Till I stepped ashore of Melbourne that first day
But I met Melba from Melbourne she made my heart yearn
She made my tears flow like wine
She let me kiss her then made me miss her cause Melba could never be mine

So in love but couldn't get her cared so much I couldn't forget her
I fell in love just a little bit more and more
There I was just like I started all alone and broken-hearted
I recall the day I left Australian shore
I was standin' there and tryin' so hard to keep from cryin'
And the more I tried the more my tears would show
Then the south breeze seem to whisper hold her close and once more kiss her
It was hopeless so I turned away to go
But I left Melba from Melbourne she made my heart yearn
She made my tears roll like wine
She wouldn't leave there I couldn't stay there
So Melba could never be mine (Melba could never be mine)",Melba from Melbourne

Cactus lovelier than orchids blooming in the patio
Soft desert stars and the strum of guitars
Makes every evening seem so sweet

Evening breezes softly murmur harmony with whippoorwills
When setting sun says the long day is done
Sweet music starts to fill the air

Hank Snow,"Everyone knows about Rudolph
Our fleet-footed friend from the north
Who lights Santa's way through the darkness
As he drives his sleigh back and forth
But there's someone else we should mention
If we want the whole story told
He carried the first gift of Christmas
More precious than diamonds or gold

Nestor was a donkey who seldom laughed or played
'Cause no one evey used him in the stable where he stayed
And all the camels teased him, the other donkeys too
They said, look at little Nestor, there's nothin' he can do

Look at little Nestor, his ears hang to his knees
When he looks at his reflection, ears are all he sees
Nestor's heart was broken and his eyes were full of tears
If only there was somethin' he could do about his ears

One dark night two strangers gave Nestor a surprise
They chose him from all others for they loved his gentle eyes
A man was called by Joseph, Mary was his bride
She needed help to Bethlehem and Nestor's back to ride

They travelled through the desert but hadn't gone too far
When winter clouds no longer let them see their guiding star
But Nestor learned a secret as he listened to the breeze
And the angels gave directions to  the ears that touched his knees

Look at little Nestor, his ears hang to his knees
When he looks at his reflection, ears are all he sees
Nestor's heart was broken and his eyes were full of tears
If only there was somethin' he could do about his ears

And so it was that Nestor found the manger where they stayed
Where kings and wise men bowed before the baby where he lay
Mary bore our Saviour and Nestor brought them there
A gift of love from God above for all the world to share

Though, Rudolph, I just love you, I know you'd want it said
Nestor's ears are lovely as a reindeer's nose is red
So children, if you're happy when you trim your Christmas trees
You might thank a little donkey whose ears hung to his knees

Look at little Nestor, his ears hang to his knees
They shouted as they praised him and his friends were all so pleased
Nestor was so happy and his eyes held no more tears
Now all the world knows Nestor for his laughter and his ears","Nestor, the Long Eared Christmas Donkey"

And my bud of love has closed, I have lost THE ONLY ROSE

On my broken heart that love has cast away.
If there's just one trace of sadness on my darlings face tonight,
Will she bloom within my heart again some day.

Will the weeds and briars vanish where the tears of sorrow fell,
And let the seeds of romance play its part.

Hank Snow,"Out in the west Texas town of El Paso I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina music would play and Feleena would whirl
Blacker than night were the eyes of Feleena wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden I was in love but in vain I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in wild as the west Texas wind
Dashing and daring a drink he was sharing with wicked Feleena the girl that I loved
So in danger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore

My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence shocked by the foul deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there

I had but one chance and that was to run
Out to the backdoor of Rosa's I ran out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one it looked like it could run up on its back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I could from the west Texas town of El Paso

Out to the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless everything's gone in life nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

I saddled up and away I did go riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet would find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso I can see Rosa's Cantina below

My love is strong and it pushes me onward down off the hill to Feleena I go
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's backdoor

Something is dreadfuly wrong for I feel a deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle I'm getting weary unable to ride
But my love for Feleena is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary I can's stop to rest

I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle I feel the bullet go deep in my chest
From out of nowhere Feleena has found me kissing my cheeks as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for one little kiss then Feleena goodbye",El Paso

And I thought of angels as I saw her there

Though life has been bitter she'd live it again 
And carry that cross that is more than her share

In a little house just built for two

I mushed from Port Barren through a blizzard of snow
Been out prospecting for two years or so
Pulled into Fairbanks the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon
As I walked in the door the music was clear
The prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she was singin' made a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below
(When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below)
It was red headed Luie who was singin' so sweet
I reached down and took the snowpacks off my feet
I reached toward the gal who was singin' the tune
We did the Eskimo hop all around the saloon

Where the caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug we did our dance on a Kodiak rug
The song she kept singing made a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska it's forty below

Verse 1:
Memories that linger in my heart,
Memories that make my heart grow cold,
Someday we'll live them all again,
When my blue moon again will turn to gold.

Chorus:
When my blue moon turns to gold again,
When the raindrops turn the clouds away,
When my blue moon turns to gold again,
You'll be back here in my arms to stay.

Verse2:
The castles we built in dreams together
Tell the sweetest story ever told,
Someday we'll live them all again
When my blue moon again will turn to gold.

Verse3:
The lips that used to thrill me so,
Your kisses were meant for only me.
Someday we'll live them all again,
When my golden moon is just a memory.

Her beauty, it seemed to expand,
Her hair hung down in long tresses,
Tied back with a blue velvet band.

As I left I told her I'd never
Come back to my old home again.

Was all that my poor heart could stand,
Every night as I lay on my pillow,
I would dream of my Blue Velvet Band.

Of home and poor mother and dad,
Like a flash by my bedside was standing
The form of my Blue Velvet Band.

I started next day for my darling,
Just to go back and make her my bride
But as I reached the old country depot,
They told my my sweet heart has died.

Where the tropical sea breezes blow.
I there fell in love with a flower so rare
And they called her the Galveston Rose.

Her heart was as true as her blue smiling eyes
And as fair as the lily that grows.
And the finest of gold in no way could compare
With the curls of my Galveston Rose.

I grew jealous and falsely accused her one day,
Said her love I no longer should know.
I've been true please believe me her little heart cried
But I left her my Galveston Rose.

Little then did I think that sometimes I'd repay
And would reap every sorrow and care;
But as years passed along I grew lonely each day
For the one I had left waiting there.

So I wrote to my darling and said I was wrong,
I'll return dear if you'll only wed.
But soon came a letter my flower had died 
And these are the words that I read.

Your sweetheart is peacefully sleeping tonight
In a grave where the white violets grow;
And enclosed, there's a curl a last token of love,
And a note from your Galveston Rose.

I was innocent dear though you left me alone,
But remember I loved only you.
And the lock that's enclosed is a curl from your Rose,
Who'll be waiting in heaven for you?",Galveston Rose
Hank Snow,"One dark and stormy night while riding down the line;
Railroad Bill, the engineer said, ""Boy, we'll have to fly!""
We've got to be on time, to meet old Number Four.
So sling the coal, we'll make it, boy, or never ride no more.

While in the rear boxcar, a lonely hobo lay,
Heading for his mother dear, who on her death-bed lay;
He raised a weary hand, to brush away a tear,
Not knowing his last drive was run, and Fate was drawing near.

When through the darkened night, a headlight bright did gleam,
O'er the roar of rolling wheels, a whistle load did scream;
As down around the curve, the mighty train did roar,
With black smoke rolling from the stack, came Flyer Number Four.

Then came an awful crash! Their last long drive was run,
On the track the hobo lay, his days of life were done;
And as the golden sun, sank slowly to the west,
His dear old mother gently smiled, and closed her eyes in death.",The Hobo's Last Ride
Hank Snow,"It don't hurt anymore
All my teardrops are dried 
No more walkin' the floor 
With that burnin' inside
Just to think it could be

And at last I am free
I Don't Hurt Anymore.

No use to deny I wanted to die
The day you said we were through
But now that I find you're out of my mind
I can't believe that it's true
I've forgotten somehow
That I cared so before
And it's wonderful now

Hank Snow,"When the western sun is sinking 
And the moon creeps through the sky
And the little doggies cuddle close and dream
Then I'll ride on down the canyon 
With a heart that's light and free
For she's waiting there 
My Texas Blue Bonnet Queen

[Chorus]
Golden love light shines, my darling, 
In your eyes so bright and blue
Cause I know you'll always be 
Like a prairie flower to me
And you'll never fade

My prairie flower and I

'Neath the moon in all its glory 
I'll whisper I love you
And we'll link two hearts 
In love together there.",My Sweet Texas Bluebonnet Queen
Hank Snow,"Kind friends you have heard the story,
And the song called Twenty One Years,
All of how two lovers parted,
Of their sorrow, pain and tears.

I am another who's heartbroken,
And I'm in this lonesome jail
I was the honest ranger,
Tried for fame but soon I failed.

I was a cowboy singer,
And I played the old guitar,
But my mind was set on roaming,
I started out for lands a-far.

Soon fell with bad companions,
And we robbed the Western mail
Shot and killed some helpless lady,
As I think my face grows pale.

I had a pretty sweet heart,
And she though the world of me,
But we parted at the station,
Down in sunny Tennessee.

Last night from her I got a letter,
Saying, ""I can never be your bride""
As the moon shone though my window,
I bowed my head and cried.

Never more we'll stroll together;
Down in dear old Lover's Lane,
I must spend my life in prison,
I pray on high we'll meet again.",Prisoned Cowboy
Hank Snow,"There's a heart that is broken today
There is someone who waits far away
One who's kneeling in prayer as she waits for me there
Asking that I might comeback some day.
Her hands are all wrinkled with care
The gold has all gone from her hair
How I long to caress her my mother God bless her
She's a rose from the garden of prayer.

When I was a boy at her knee
She was more than a mother to me
As I gaze into space I can see her sweet face
As I stood by her old rocking chair.
When cares would impress on my brow
Or someone would turn me away
She would always be near me to comfort and cheer me
She's a rose from the garden of prayer.

So I'm leaving and heading that way
To a mother so feeble and grey
Where she waits there alone in our Heaven called home
By the window she's watching for me.
Soon my sorrows and troubles will end
Where all nature is blooming so fair
And I'll rest in the arms of the one that is true
She's my rose from the garden of prayer.",She's a Rose from the Garden of Prayer
Hank Snow,"When the postman delivered a letter
It filled her old heart full of joy
But she didn't know till she read the inside
It was the last one from her darlin' boy

""Dear mom"" was the way that it started
""I miss you so much"" it went on
Mom, I didn't know that I love you so
But I'll prove it when this war is won

I'm writing this down in a trench mom
Don't scold if it isn't so neat
You know as you did when I was a kid
And came home with mud on my feet

Now the captain just gave us our orders
And mom we will carry them through
I'll finish this letter the first chance I get
But for now I'll just say I love you

Then the mother's old hands began to tremble
And she fought against tears in her eyes
But they came unashamed for there was no name
And she knew that her darlin' boy had died

That night as she knelt by her bedside
She prayed Lord above hear my plea
And protect all the sons that are fighting tonight
And dear God keep our Canada free",Soldier's Last Letter
Hank Snow,"Traveling the lonely roads of sorrow,
Heartaches are all I've ever known.
Time has turned a million pages,
Fate has dealt and I'm alone.

[Chorus]
But somewhere along life's highway
From your new love you may part,
And you will reap the pains, my darling,
That go with a broken heart.

The little stars all twinkled brighter,
The moon smiled gaily from the blue.
The flowers seemed to spread more beauty
Oh, so glad 'cause I met you.

[Chorus]

Though you've made my life a failure,
I have never been untrue.
And these lonely years have wasted,
All because my love for you.

You played your game to leave me darling,
Your game I did not understand.
So you dealt the cards against me
And I played the losing hand.

Hank Snow,"Don't forget me little darling while I'm growing old and gray
Just a little thought before I'm going far away
I'll be waiting on the hillside where the wild red roses grow
On the sunny side of the mountains where the rippling waters flow

Don't forget about those days we courted many years ago
Don't forget all those promises you gave me and so
I'll be waiting on the hillside for the day you will call
On the sunny side of the mountain where the rippling waters fall

Please tell me darling in your letter do you think of me
Please answer little darling tell me where you can be
It's been so long since I've seen you but your love still lingers on
Don't forget me little darling though our love affair is gone.""",Sunny Side of the Mountain
Hank Snow,"Boys I was born in Texas State, 
Many years ago,
I've rode on ev'ry range and plain, 
There's no place I don't know

I love to swing the lariat, 
That's all I'll ever do, 
I'm a two-gun singing cowboy 
And I've never had the blues.

For I hop on my old Pinto, 
And o'er the plains we ride,
Just swingin' in the saddle, 
My guitar hangs by my side

Old Pinto's always willing, 
As for me I'm never sad,
You'll find there beats an honest heart 
In this old Texas lad.

I sleep out on the rolling plains, 
My blanket for a bed, 
Waiting for the break of day 
To ride out to the herd

I'll mount my old cow-pony, 
Wear my boots and Stetson too,
And ride all day on Texas plains 
Beneath the skies of blue.

Now when my cheque of life I cash 
For the land beyond the sky,
I'm goin' to ride old Pinto out 
Across that Great Divide

I'll ride the last great Round-up 
Far across the Golden Plains,
Well boys, I hope you liked my song, 
I'm on my way again.

Hank Snow,"On an ocean of dreams 
I have wandered it seems
Just wanderin', wanderin' on,
Since I found the note, sweetheart 
That you wrote just sayin'
That you had already gone.

[Chorus]
Will the pretty bird sing?
Will the roses in the Spring
Still blossom when they find 
That you have gone?
Will the old pals be true
Or will they all leave me too?

Just wanderin', wanderin' on
Will the little brook play
As it winds along its way?
Will the stars keep on shinin' 
Tho' you've gone
Will they find their way to you
Will they tell you that I'm blue
Or will they too leave me wanderin' on?

Tho' you've left me and gone 
I'll keep wanderin' on
Wanderin' down life's way
And beneath the lovely blue 
I may wander back to you
And my dreams will all come true someday.

Hank Snow,"Another cryin' night will soon be over now
The morning light won't help, I'll still be blue
'Cause everywhere I turn there's only loneliness
Memories are all I can hold to

Memories are the moments when we were as one
Memories you would only hope to find
Memories, in your loving arms, you'd whisper my name
Then I would feel your burning limbs on mine

All these memories are locked within my heart
My world was gone the moment I lost you
If wants could talk, they'd tell you of the tears I've cried
But memories are all I can hold to

Memories are the moments when we were as one
Memories you would only hope to find

Hank Snow,"They heard the breeze in the trees making weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues
And from a jail came the wail of a down-hearted frail
And they played that as part of the blues

From a whippoorwill high on a hill they took a new note
Pushed it through a horn till it was worn into a blue note
And then they nursed it and rehearsed it and gave out with the news
That the southland gave birth of the blues

Hank Snow,"I rode your ocean liner to Newfoundland,
Where I made a living in an iron mine.
When I got my fill I went to Nova Scotia,
And I fished the salty waters for a time.

Passing through Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick,
I could see the rocks and cliffs of solid stone.
Listening to the seagulls calling to each other
Made me miss my darling and my distant home.

Canadian Pacific, carry me three thousand miles,
Through the valleys and the forests,
To the sunshine of her smile,
'Cross the plains and the rugged mountains,
Keep this wandering boy from harm.
Canadian Pacific, take me to my baby's arms.

The Atlantic disappeared on the horizon,
And Quebec lay waiting for me down the track.
For a while I drove a truck to keep from star-ving.
In Ontario I was a lumber-jack.

Man-itoba and Saskatchewan then followed,
Where the wheat fields and the old Red River flowed.
In the quiet hours your whistling on the prairie,
Touched my heart and set my memories aglow.

I could feel the nearness of her warm, sweet kisses,
When you rolled into Alberta westward bound.
I worked on an oil rig to make some money,
For a ticket to the sweetest girl around.

Pushing on past Lake Louise in all it's splendor,
Where the trees and Rockies touch the sky above,
I got to British Columbia and heaven,
On your track I made it back to my true love.

Canadian Pacific, carry me three thousand miles,
Through the valleys and the forests,
To the sunshine of her smile.

Keep this wandering boy from harm.

15 cars and 15 restless riders 3 conductors and 24 sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey the train rolls out of Kankakee
And moves along past houses farms and fields

Passin' trains that have no name and switchyards full of old black men
Of graveyards full of rusted automobiles
Good mornin' America how are you say don't ya know me I'm your native son
I'm a train they call the City of New Orleans

I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done
Dealin' cards with an old man on the club car many a point nobody's keepin' score
Hey now pass that paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels a rumblin' neath the floor

And the sons of poor men porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their daddy's magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babies asleep rockin' to that gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Night time on the City of New Orleans changin' cars in Memphis Tennessee
Half way home and we'll be there by mornin'
Through the Mississippi darkness rollin' down to the sea

To see that Colorado country morning with the dusty roads and warm sunshine
I've got the Colorado country morning and a Denver woman on my mind
I remember standing at the door and looking back as she lay sleeping

And very gently through the window pane the morning sun was creeping
And without a sound I turned around and softly kissed her goodbye

And summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurgling crackling caltron in some train yard
My beard a roughen coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands round a tin can I pretend I hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry

As the train pulls into the station
I can see Peggy waiting there for me
But I can tell there's something wrong
She's not the happy girl she used to be
Peggy hasn't said much
As she drives along the road back to our farm
And she ignored the question
When I asked her where she got this pretty car.

As she pulled into the driveway
I can see she's planted flowers all around
I'm surprised to see good paint
I thought the place would surely be run down
I said Peggy you've done wonders
And I wonder how you've done it on your own
She said I had to hire a hand
I never could have run this farm alone.

CHANGE TO D:
[D] Then Peggy started cryin' and she said
There's something that you have to [E] see
There's a [A] little boy inside
And you should know that he is only [D] three
We went inside and Peggy said
I'm sorry but there's nothing I can [E] do
But if [A] you'll let us stay here
I'll try my best to make it up to [D] you.

The little boy looked frightened
At the thin man who has come in from the cold
He hides behind his mother's skirt
As she bends down to wipe his little nose
I said Peggy, I still love you
And I'll do my best to try to understand
For God has pardoned both of us
And don't the Governor write a pretty hand?

Then [A] Peggy dried her tears when I said
Don't the Governor write a pretty [D] hand?

What will become of the hobo whenever his time comes to die
Has the Master up yonder in heaven got a place that we might call our home
Will we have to work for a living or must we continue to roam
Will there be any freight trains in heaven any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops and brakemen will they tell us that we cannot ride
Will the hobo chum with the rich man will we always have money to spare
Will they hand respect for a hobo in that land that lies hidden up there

It wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad the first day that she planted it
Was just a twig
Then the first snow came and she ran out to brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart kinda dumb and kinda smart
And I loved her so
I surprised her with a puppy kept me up all Christmas Eve
Two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her when I came home from working late
Cause I would know
That she'd been sitting there and crying
Over some sad and silly late late show
And honey I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly and found her crying needlessly
In the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring when flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away
And honey I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
Yes one day while I wasn't home while she was there and all alone
The angels came
Now all I have is memories of honey and I wake up nights
And call her name
Now my life's an empty stage where honey lived and honey played
And love grew up
A small cloud passes overhead and cries down on the flower bed
Where honey loved
And honey I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could",Honey

Remember I love you I just want you to know

When I cannot steal to you heart to heart
If warm lips should whisper sweet words that aren't so

Hank Snow,"Once I lived a life of wine and roses
And I drank a lot back then for one concern
Success for me lay just around the corner
I thought my social friends would help me make the turn
But now I'm paying for the days of wine and roses
A victim of the drunken life I chose
Now all my social friends look down their noses
Cause I kept the wine and I threw away the rose
[ steel ]
I stood by and watched the bottle take control of me
The turn I made was not the one I'd planned
And I watched my social standings slip away from me
While I watched the bottle slowly take command
And now I'm paying for...
Cause I kept the wine and I threw away the rose",I Threw Away the Rose
Hank Snow,"Somewhere a telephone is ringing right now
Someone's old sweetheart is on the line
She's calling to patch up an old love affair
Oh I wish it was mine

Somebody's writing a letter right now
And saying Lawd oh I was blind
Somebody's darling longs to come home
Oh I wish it was mine

But you never write me and you never phone
There's somebody else on your mind
And somebody's heart is glad you don't love me
Oh I wish it was mine

But you never write me...

Hank Snow,"Well I had a friend named Gambling Bob he used to steal gamble and rob
He thought was the smartest guy in town
But I found out last Monday that Bob got locked up Sunday
They got him in the jailhouse way down town
He's in the jailhouse now he's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice to quit playin' cards and a shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now
[ fiddle - steel ]
Well I went out last Tuesday met a girl named Susie
I told her I was the swellest man around
We started to spend my money and she started to call me honey
We took in every cabarete in town
We're in the jailhouse now we're in the jailhouse now
I've told the judge right to his face we didn't like to see this place
We're in the jailhouse now

Hank Snow,"In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as I'm with you (as long as I'm with you-ooh)

In a far-away land
On the tropic sea sand
If your hand's in my hand
I won't be blue

Way up on the mountain
Or way down in the valley
I know I'll be happy
Anyplace, anywhere, I don't care

[Chorus]
In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as you are there

I could be happy in one little room with only a table and chair. As happy as I'd be in a kingdom 
by the sea, darling, if you were there. And I could be rich or I could be poor, but if you were by my side, 
I could be any place in this whole wide world and I know I'd be satisfied.

Or way down in the valley
I know I'll be happy

It just happened that way
And all the time inside my heart I knew that

Now I can't stand to be away from you 
But I'm alone every day
I didn't plan to fall in love with you 
It just happened that way

I saw you and I loved you 
Why I'll never know
There wasn't one chance in a million 
That our love would grow
You were too far up above me

But like driftwood on the river 
I floated on helplessly

I don't want to worry if I'll hurt or hurt somebody
You can't be happy when love comes to an end then you're alone
I won't try to change again for a woman's sake
'Cause I won't be around one who has rules for me to follow
For when a love falls through it hurts and you will never be the same

And it takes too long to heal a broken heart
It hurts too bad when love gets pulled apart
From now on I just won't let it start
'Cause it takes too long to heal a broken heart

It don't really matter why when love is gone
If cheatin' is to blame or it died from natural causes
The end is still the same it always causes pain at least to one

And it takes too long to heal a broken heart
It hurts too bad when love gets pulled apart
From now on I just won't let it start
'Cause it takes too long to heal a broken heart

Cause I thought that leaving really wasn't even on your mind

Just bidin' my time while the glow from the wine makes a fool of me
Over and over I practice every day
What to say when I see you but when I see you my tears get in the way
Just bidin' my time while the glow from the wine makes a fool of me
I spend my nights making up things I might have to say to you
To stop you from going yet keep you from knowing how I feel
But till the light says goodbye to the night and your face I see
I'll just bidin' my time while the glow from the wine makes a fool of me

Locked within my troubled mind
Is a love I can't forget

When he starts to settle down
He's proud to let her wear his name

Do I dare to set her free
Got a feelin' in my mind
That she's just one of a kind

Pulled away from my hometown
Thought I'd leave her love behind

On the highways of my mind

Seen a million pretty girls
Pretty girls aren't hard to find
But she's a rare breed, I'm convinced

And the youngest dream of growin' up to ride
On a freight train leavin' town not knowin' where I'm bound
No one could change my mind but mama tried
One and only rebel child for my family meek and mild
My mama seemed to know what lay in store
Spite of all my Sunday learnin' toward the bad I kept on turnin'
Till mama couldn't hold me anymore
And I turned twenty one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right but mama tried mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better but her pleadings I denied
That leaves only me to blame cause mama tried

Dear old daddy rest his soul left my mama heavy load

Hank Snow,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose

All I ever wanted in my life was you
Now there's nothing left worth looking forward to
Except the past that's full of broken promises

When each weary day is through

Dreaming of your tender kiss
Always thinking how I miss my happiness

Have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again
There'll be no blue memories then

Hank Snow,"And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear,
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.

I've lived a life that's full,
I travelled each and every highway,
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Regrets, I've had a few,
But then again too few to mention
Did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
Planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it My Way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it My Way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught. 
To say the things he truly feels; 
And not the words of one who kneels.

I took the blows 
And did it my way!",My Way

And the jailerman turns that big black key that's when your spirit falls
Then you drag yourself up to the bars and while you gaze out at the stars

Why did I stray from the rightous path nobody knows but me
There on the outside you all can laugh I don't need your sympathy
For after I'm paid for the liquor I've sold
Gonna leave this place worth my weight in gold
So why did I stray from the rightous path nobody knows but me

When you realize that you're all alone sittin' in a two-by-four
That little cell is just a taste of hell if you ain't been there before

From a husband who had filled her heart with pain
On the table laid a note these simple words she wrote
Goodbye I hope we'll never meet again
To her mother she returned for her old home she had yearned
For all the love she had for him had pled
But he sought her out at last with her partners for the past
But her mother met him in the door and said
She was happy till she met you the fault is all your own
Id she wishes to forget you please leave her alone
She has come to her old mother because there is no other
She'll be happy in her home sweet home

I have come to say goodbye said the husband with a sigh
Just let me take her to my heart again
Says the mother it's too late all her love has turned to hate
So go your way your pleading heart's in vain

The love I bet you part us we are wed
But the mother answered nay and sadly turned away
And once again to him she calmly said
She was happy till she met you...

Hank Snow,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk

Hank Snow,"She was a young and pretty Coleman county farm girl
Never been more than fifty miles from home
I was just a drifter, I was living off the land
Spent the summer on her daddy's farm

In the evening we'd walk along the railroad
We'd hear that lonesome whistle in the night
And she'd pretend we rode the rails to Denver
'Cause her head was full of flashin' neon lights

Twas that big old shiny diesel as it rounded Carter's bend
Was enough to make a young girl want to roam
She'd pretend she rode those shiny rails all around the world
And had the Texas Silver Zephyr bring her home

As summer work was over and restless got to me
I kept talkin' 'bout the places I would go
Then her young head got to spinnin' for the things she'd never seen
So she followed me to Denver in the fall

Then jobs got scarce in central Colorado
And then the winter nights got awful cold
Just one old army blanket was the only one we had
No money for the oil to run the stove

Yes, that big old shiny diesel as it rounded Carter's bend
Was enough to make a young girl want to roam
But through all those hungry nights the only promise that I made
I had the Texas Silver Zephyr take her home

When she started feelin' bad, she didn't tell me
She had a way of keepin' problems all her own
So I didn't know her troubles with the baby
Before I could get a doctor, she was gone

Lord, I know it's not the way she really wanted things to be
In her dreams she had a pull man all her own
But she'd be proud of me to know I kept my promise
And had the Texas Silver Zephyr take her home

Hank Snow,"Here's the house where we once lived 
That I had love too much to give
For the girl who said that she'll be mine
And here's the room where we both slept 
And when she laughed that's where I wept
We had love so very hard to find
There's the chair that held the man 
That held the girl that held the hand
That wore the ring that I no longer wear
And there's the clock that used to chime 
But I've lost track of telling time
And there's a picture I see everywhere
In the kitchen where she cooks 
I can see her recipe book
And on the table there's her favorite glass
In the dynama afraid do look cause 
I will see that leather book
Sunday morning she was first to class

I pull up shades I pull up blinds 
'Cause it's gone the tie that binds
It's broken now but God knows I still care
Sometimes love is not too pretty 
When you find it's gone
I guess now I lose my mind I already lost a home
I walk these halls a hollow man 
I'm tryin' to do the best I can
But I can't walk away from yesterday
I try to be a stirin' man 
And rule her with an iron hand
But somehow too much love come in the way
There's the chair that held the man 
That held the girl that held the hand
That wore the ring that I no longer wear
And here's the beer that I would drink 
To stop the mind that wants to think
About the girl who said she didn't care

That held the girl that held the hand
That wore the ring that I no longer wear",There's the Chair

Until she came along just think what we were missin'
That's why today I'm shouting hooray for the gal who invented kissin'

That's been carryin' the mail 
That's been tellin' your troubles to me.
You told me a lie 
For ev'ry cross-tie 
From Frisco to old Tennessee.
Nobody knew your little game; 
Ev'rybody gave me the blame.

In the smoke and the fog 
Of this old switchyard
And that dreary whistle's farewell.
Bid the folks goodbye, told 'em not to cry, 
I'd only be gone for a spell.
I'm playin' in this game to win, 
And when I find you I'm movin' in.

Tried to make me believe 
I was the one that deceived,
That I drove you to the things you'd done.
Said you loved me in vain 
And our old love train
Had made it's final run.
And in your letter you said 
You were gonna be wed.

Your little joke was fine 
But that old bunch-a line
Didn't register with me.
So you'd better get loose 
From your other caboose
And meet this old S. P.
I'm speedin' in tonight, 
You'd better treat your daddy right.

Better get on the ball,

And those ramblers are runnin' on time.

That he'd better vacate,

I hear you callin' aloud,
Standin' in the station door.

And you can't go roamin' no more.

Why do you punish me for loving you,
You're counting my mistakes, how about yours?
Why do you sentence me to nights of tears?
Convicting all these dreams I've dreamed for years?

My heart cries out behind these prison bars,
It pleads to you for your true love to set it free.
Why do you punish me? Is love a crime?
If so I'll spend a lifetime loving, serving time.

Hank Snow,"In a certain city, where 
The girls are cute and pretty, 
They have a raggy jazzy jazz time tune. 
When you hear that syncopated 
Jazz created melody 
You could dance all morning 
Night and noon, 
When the slide trombone 
And moaning saxophone begin to play.

Wish I had a million women,

With his thousand wives or more,

He could dance the night and day away.

That tantalizing 12th. Street Rag. 
 
First you slide and then you glide, 
Then shimmie for a while; 
To the left then to the right

Watch your step then Pirouette, 
Fox Trot, then squeeze your pal 
Over you comes stealing 
Such a funny feeling 
'Til you feel 
Your senses reeling, 
Tantalizing, hypnotizing, 
Mesmerizing strain, 
I can't get enough of it 
Please play it o'er again

When she goes a-walkin' the island starts talkin' admiring the golden physique

Down in her shack by the sea

Was the only daughter of an engineer

Hank Snow,"1.What a beautiful thought I am thinking
Concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded
On the pages of God's Holy Word.

2. All the other birds are flocking 'round her
And she is despised by the squad
But the great speckled bird in the Bible
Is one with the great church of God.

3. All the other churches are against her
They envy her glory and fame
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name.

4. Desiring to lower her standard
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake.

5. She is spreading her wings for a journey
She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky.

6. In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation is o'er.

7. I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look.

8. When He cometh descending from heaven
On the cloud that He writes in His Word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of that great speckled bird.

Buried deep in her grave lies the one that I love

More precious than diamonds, more precious than gold

She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

She promised someday to become my sweet wife
I bought her the ring to wear on her finger
But the angels they called her to Heaven one night

I knew eventually that you'd grow tired of me
That's why I tried so hard not to fall in love with you
To have a broken heart and my heart fall apart

I'll step aside for you and you alone
And when I'm gone just promise you'll remember
That I was once your darling, all your own

Before you go, please answer this one question
As you gaze into my tear dimmed eyes
Can it be true you never cared about me
And all those things you told were just lies

I'll step aside for you if you don't want me

John Henry had a little woman and her name was Polly Ann
John Henry he got sick and he had to go to bed
But Polly drove the steel like a man Lord Lord Polly drove the steel like a man

John Henry went to the tunnel to drive steam hammer by his side
Well he beat that drill till the end of the tunnel
Laid down his hammer and he cried Lord Lord laid down his hammer and he cried

John Henry drove the steel on that mountain till his hammer caught on fire
And the last words we heard John Henry say
Cool drink of water before I die Lord Lord a cool drink of water before I die

They say there lies a steel drivin' man Lord Lord yonder lies a steel drivin' man

Writer Leon McAuliffe

Been runnin' around, seen many a town, and maybe you'll find I'm the kind of guy that brags. But listen to me and see if you don't agree No melody rolls like that old steel guitar rag And when they slide that thing, along those strings It sounds so doggone heavenly, you can hear the Angels sing And when you stomp your feet, your heart will beat, A rhythm to the old steel guitar rag Break or bridge: You may be kind choosy, 'bout the kind of songs you hear, You maybe like them blusey, makes you cry right in your beer, But if you want a song that's bound to dry away your tears, Make happy your soul with that old steel guitar rag.

(Jimmie Rodgers)
Â« Â© '29 Peer International Â»

For years and years I've rambled drank my wines and gambled
But one day I thought I'd settle down
I met a perfect lady she said she'd be my baby
We built a cottage in the old hometown
But somehow I can't forget my good old rambling days
The railroad trains are calling me away
I may be rough I may be wild I may be tough and countrified
But I can't give up my good old rough and rowdy ways
Sometimes I meet a bounder who knew me when I was a rounder
He grabs my hand and says boy have a drink
We'd go down to the poolroom get in the gang and then soon
The daylight comes before I'd had a wink
But somehow I can't forget...

Hank Thompson,"Pop a top again I just got time for one more round 
Sit 'em up my friends 
Then I'll be gone 

Then you can let some other fool sit down 
I'd like for you'd to listen to a joke I heard today 
From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away 
I'd tried to smile and did a while it felt so outta place 
Did you ever hear of a clown with tears drops streaming down his face. 

Pop a top again I think I'll have another round 
Sit 'em up my friend Then I'll be gone 
And you can let some other fool sit down. 

Home for me is misery and here I am wasting time 
Cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind 
But then you see her leaving me it's not what I prefer 
So it's either here just drinking beer or at home remembering her.

Many miles I am away
From the place I rode my pony through the draw
Where the Oak and Blackjack trees
Kiss the playful prairie breeze
In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born

To be your cherished wife

You cheat and lie you make them cry
And promise each the world

In the air there's a feeling of 
Christmas Children laughing, people passing 
Meeting smile after smile 
And on every street corner you'll hear 
Silver bells, silver bells 
It's Christmas time in the city 
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring 
Soon it will be Christmas day 
Strings of streetlights, even stoplights 
Blink a bright red and green 
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures 
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch 
This is Santa's big scene 
And above all this bustle you'll hear 
Silver bells, silver bells 
It's Christmas time in the city 
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring 
Soon it will be Christmas day",Silver Bells
Hank Thompson,"Smokey the bar lights dimly low
It's good that way cause heartaches don't show
Each hand holds a glass  each glass holds a beer
Jukebox records play amid sorrow and cheer
 
Lots of them are happy they laugh and tell their jokes
While lots of them are here because they're just lonely folks
And then there are others whose hearts wear a scar
But you can't see them crying it's old Smokey the bar
 
Smokey the bar lights glowing dim
They hardly notice when someone walks in
Order up your drink to the music that's loud
You'll find a friend somewhere in the crowd
 
While the ashes are falling from the smoke that you inhale
There's an old dream to recall or a new one that failed
Should a tear betray your eye if memory slips to far
Don't tell them that you're crying just say Smokey the bar

Hank Thompson,"Tomorrow night you'll have another sweetheart
Tomorrow night you'll have somebody new
I'm a fool to think your indiscreet heart
Could ever love someone with love that's true
You love me in your mind and not your heart dear
And you'll change your mind tomorrow night
Or I see you smiling at another
Another love you'll have tomorrow night

Last night I held your hand beneath the table
You said that you already had a day
But you said tomorrow night you might be able
To keep this rendezvous with me a date
Tonight we are together but I know dear
Another's arms assure to hold you tight

The jukebox will be playing your favorite song tonight
You're the loneliest fool that's living in your make believe world
You're a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody's girl
Though you chose the life that lead you to sorrow and shame
Each shoulder that you cry on, you swear that I'm to blame
You gave up the one that loved you to live in your sorted world
You're a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody's girl
You can't say I didn't love you as you're crying in your beer
You drink to every heartache and wish that I was near
With each drink you passion surges and start your head to whirl
You're a honky tonk sweetheart and anybody's girl
I don't understand your feelings but emotions are strange things
Why you gave up the life your leading and gave up your wedding ring
You flaunt your charms and beauty and toss your pretty curls

Hank Thompson,"She lives her life in honky tonks and crowded backstreet bars
A world of make believe that knows no sun or moon or stars
Just a glitter of the great white way and the glare of city lights
Where music's loud she's in the crowd, a girl in the night

I wonder if she's thinking of dreams that didn't last
I wonder if she's haunted by heartaches from the past
Perhaps there is a story of a love that wasn't right
Now shadows hide her empty pride, a girl in the night

She's sitting there so lonely as she lights a cigarette
The smoke rings rise and in her eyes there seems to be regret
Is she there to tempt the lover in a dress that hugs her tight?
A glass of wine to pass the time, a girl in the night

I wonder if she's thinking of dreams that didn't last
I wonder if she's haunted by heartaches from the past

Hank Thompson,"When your lover cries hold her close and whisper low
That tears are only rain to make love grow
Kiss her tenderly tell her that you love her so
For tears are only rain to make love grow
Anyone can plant a seed but everybody knows
It needs both sun and rain before it blooms into a rose
When your lover cries hold her close and whisper low
That tears are only rain to make love grow
(Tears are only rain to make love grow)
When your lover smiles let her set your heart aglow
But don't forsake her when she's feeling low
Hold her to your heart dry her eyes and let her know
That tears are only rain to make love grow

But when she sheds a tears it may be cause of you
When your lover cries tell her that you love her so

From twilight till dawn I'm trudging on and on, on my way to the rainbow's end

And with all your young heart you learned to care
It brought you shame and disgrace the world has tumbled in your place
Because they call our love a back street affair
They say you wrecked my home I'm a husband that's gone wrong
They don't know the sorrow that we've had to bear
For the one that I'm tied to was the first to prove untrue
Now they call our love a back street affair

You thrilled me with strange delight,

Tryin' to think of all that I've gone through and hang your head in shame

Paint through me a curve but I don't deserve to keep me in girls like you
I used to think that someday I would choose the one to love my whole life through
But I'm never chooser I wind up as a loser I keep meeting girls like you
We laugh and cry then say goodbye our love was just a passing thing
A love that's wrong can't linger long but how many heartaches can it bring
Maybe I'll get wise and open up my eyes and play the game just like they do
I guess I'll get to be just like my company if I keep meeting girls like you

Hank Thompson,"Your daddy was a gambling man my mother said to me
He left me when you were a child but he was all this world to me
I know your daddy loved me too from tattoo on his arms
Was a heart of love that bored my name and was his good luck charm
I didn't heed my mother's words to leave the cards alone
I took to gambling just like dad and left my mother's home

One night the gang was gathered round we delt the hand of draw
An old man sat across from me and this is what I saw
From out his sleeve he pulled the card and I pulled out my gun
I shot him dead not knowing then what evil I had done
He fell across the table his hands reached out in vain
His sleeve slipped back and upon his arm I could see so plain
I gazed down at his lifeless arm and I hung my head in shame
For upon his arm was tattooed heart and I saw my mother's name",I Saw My Mother's Name
Hank Thompson,"They ask me if I'm sorry that I loved her so
Someone I couldn't ever have and had to let her go
They know I'm broken hearted they've watched me when I cry
They saw a man who bowed his head and once held it so high
Was it birth of the heartaches and the tears I've shed in vain
To build my mansions in the clouds then seen them fall like rain
I only know I loved her and knew I couldn't win
But if I had it to do over I'd do it again

Some people thought me foolish and said our love was wrong
That end our world of make believe we couldn't carry on
But I wouldn't trade the treasure for things just as they were
For any precious moment that I spent with her

She made me feel so happy and she made the world seem right

That my heart has healed completely from the heartbreaks of the past

When somebody mentions you my heart can feel the sting
But I play the part so perfectly no one suspects a thing
Then they see me smiling and I'm with somebody else
I've convinced everybody everybody but myself

I act so nonchalantly when they mention my own pain
I pretend as though I'm searching when I start to call your name
It would be a different story if they knew just how I felt
I've convinced everybody everybody but myself

You probably heard from others how indifferent I have been
But they only see the upside they can't see me deep within

Are you wondering where you right or wrong for walking out
In the back of your mind is there still a little part of me

In the arms of another, you always discover
The memory of an old love creeps in
Does it flow like a river and your heart won't deliver you

That someone's in love with you
I think you'll find, it's in the back of my mind too

Makes no difference now what kind of life they hands me
I'll get along without you now that's plain to see
I don't care what happens next for I'll get by somehow
I don't worry cause it makes no difference now
It was just a year ago when I first met you
I learned to love you and I thought you'd love me too
But now that's all in the past and I'll forget somehow
I don't worry cause it makes no difference now
Now that we have really parted I can't believe we're through
I don't blame myself and I'm sure I can't blame you
There was something had to happen and it happened somehow
I don't worry cause it makes no difference now
After all it's said and done I'll soon forget you
Although I know that it will be so hard to do
Let things happen as they will and I'll get by somehow
I don't worry cause it makes no difference now

He was making his way to some station to catch a long distance train

May I sleep in your barn Mister it is cold lying out on the ground
And the cold north wind is whistling and I have no place to lie down
Now I have no tobacco nor matches and I'm sure I can cause you no harm
I will tell you my story kind Mister for it runs through my heart like a storm

It was three years ago just last summer I shall never forget that sad day
When a stranger came out from the city and said that he wanted to stay
Now the stranger was fair tall and handsome and he looked like a man who had wealth
And he wanted to stay in the country said he wanted to stop for his health

One night as I came from my workshop I was whistling and singing with joy
I expected a kind hearty welcome from my sweet loving wife and my boy
But what did I find but a letter it was placed in my room on the stand
And the moment my eyes fell upon it I picked it right up in my hand

Now this note said my wife and the stranger had left and had taken my son
Oh I wonder if God up in heaven only knows what this stranger has done
May I sleep in your barn Mister it is cold lying out on the ground
And the cold north wind is a whistling and I have no place to lie down",The Luckiest Heartache in Town
Hank Thompson,"You'll be sorry in a little while, my friend
When your new love has come to an end
Let me warn you for heartaches to prepare
I know my friend ?cause my old flame is your new love affair

It hurts to see you take her from my side
And I know you think that she'll become your bride
But she'll break your heart and leave you standing there
I know my friend ?cause my old flame is your new love affair

It's so hard to know I'm just her used-to-be
And she's telling you the things she told to me
You'll be sorry that you ever learn to care
I know my friend ?cause my old flame is your new love affair

Now, you've become a captive of her charms
But love can grow so cold that once was warm
Then your romance will vanish in the air
I know my friend ?cause my old flame is your new love affair
",My Old Flame
Hank Thompson,"To someone new you're about to go
 But after the Charm has passed 
You'll come back because I know the new wears off too fast. 
You're like a Kid with a brand new toy 
But the luster just won't last, 
Your latest love is a passing joy 
'Cause the new wears off too fast

[Chorus] 
You find a fascination 
In loving someone new 
They draw you like a magnet 
And then you say ""we're through!"" 

The love you thought was pure as gold 
Was just as cheap as brass 
I knew his love would soon grow old 
'Cause the new wears off too fast 
You say you found another one 
Who's really in your class 
But you'll find he's not your kind 
'Cause the new wears off too fast 
All that glitters is not gold 
Gems alone, don't flash, 
Your one-time thing is a passing fling 
'Cause the new wears off too fast

[Chorus]",The New Wears Off Too Fast

Hank Thompson,"I'm gonna buy a Paper Doll that I can call my own 
A doll that other fellows cannot steal 
And then the flirty, flirty guys with their flirty, flirty eyes 
Will have to flirt with dollies that are real 
When I come home at night she will be waiting 
She'll be the truest doll in all this world I'd rather have a 
Paper Doll to call my own 
Than have a fickle-minded real live girl 
I guess I had a million dolls or more 
I guess I've played the doll game o'er and o'er 
I just quarreled with Sue, that's why I'm blue 
She's gone away and left me just like all dolls do 
I'll tell you boys, it's tough to be alone 
And it's tough to love a doll that's not your own 
I'm through with all of them 
I'll never ball again 
Say boy, whatcha gonna do? 
I'm gonna buy a Paper Doll that I can call my own 
A doll that other fellows cannot steal

Hank Thompson,"You said that you'd be mine and we signed that dotted line
I thought that we'd be happy, you and me
If I had only known your love was just a loan
For now you're asking me to set you free

I never thought your kisses were like a charge you count
That I'd have to pay in heartaches for taking my amount
I'll give you back your love that I've had all these years
But I'm paying off the interest with my tears

It's the expiration date, you say there's no rebate
And I guess you'll say my heart is overdrawn
Another love you chose so my account is closed
And now, I'll have an empty heart at home

My credit's discontinued, you say there's someone new
To take over all the payments on a heart that's over you
I'll give you back your love that I've had all these years
But I'm paying off the interest with my tears

I didn't understand your easy payment planned
That I would only have you for a while
The love contract you wrote was a just short term note
You placed my name on your inactive wile

I never thought your kisses were like a charge you count
That I'd have to pay in heartaches for taking my amount
I'll give you back your love that I've had all these years
But I'm paying off the interest with my tears",Paying off the Interest With My Tears
Hank Thompson,"You were mine for just a while now you're puttin' on the style
And you've never once looked back to your home across the track
You're the gossip of the town but my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground pick me up on your way down
Pick me up on your way down when you're blue and all alone

When their glamor starts to bore you come on back where you belong
When you've learned these things are true I'll be waiting here for you
When you tumble to the ground pick me up on your way down
They have changed your attitude made you haughty and so rude

Your new friends can take the blame underneath you're still the same
You may be their pride and joy but they'll find another toy
When your new love can't be found pick me up on your way down
Pick me up on your way down",Pick Me Up on Your Way Down
Hank Thompson,"A rock down deep in the ocean means more than my heart means to you
I don't know what changed your notion what makes you do things like you do
You told me that there was no other but those words have proven untrue
There's no use to help me further I'm lost like a cloud in the blue

Like a wave that rise on the seashore for something that never can reach
My heart to you doesn't mean more than a small grain of sand on the beach
Like you toss a rock in the ocean to be lost like the words of my plea
That's how you discarded devotion just like a stone in the sea",Rock in the Ocean
Hank Thompson,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone",San Antonio Rose
Hank Thompson,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Hank Thompson,"The leaves of brown came tumbling down
Remember that September in the rain
The sun went out just like a dying ember
That September in the rain

To every word of love, I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play a sweet refrain
Though spring is here, to me it's still September
That September in the rain

The leaves of brown came tumbling down
Remember that September in the rain
The sun went out just like a dying ember

To every word of love, I heard you whisper

Though spring is here, to me it's still September

Hank Thompson,"She's a girl without any sweetheart and each night she sits there alone
This whole world she'd give for a new start but the chances she had now are gone
She used to have boys by the dozens but each one she left sad and blue
Now she's a girl without any sweetheart and it's all cause she couldn't be true
[ steel - fiddle ]
Each line in her face tells a story of each other heart that she broke
It's too late now to say that she's sorry for each unkind word that she spoke
The flower of you finally faded her old love she cannot renew
Now she's a girl without any sweetheart and it's all cause she couldn't be true

After all the things you've said if I want to look at red
I look at this broken heart of mine
You broke my heart and left it slowly pleading
A crimson stream is red as cherry wine
It could have been as sweet but you tossed it at your feet
Take a look at this broken heart of mine

It's a mangled mess of many mornful moments
A symbol of a love that was so blind
It shows that when there's hate it can't be to reate
Take a look at this broken heart of mine
You leered at love then laughed and left it lying
To wither like a grape upon the vine
Like a garden choked with weeds like the flowers turned to seeds
Take a look at this broken heart of mine

From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
From the queen of the flowing mountains to the southbells by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome and known quite well by all
She's a regular combination on the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle to the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear that lonesome hoboes call
You're travelin' through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball
She came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she rolled into the station you could hear all the people say
Now there's a gal from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball
Our eastern states are dandy so the people always say
From New York to St Louis and Chicago by the way
From the hills of Minnesota where the rippling waters fall
No changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball
Here's to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
And long to be remembered round the ports of Alabam
His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
We'll carry him home to Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear that lonesome hoboes call
You're traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

Hank Thompson,"What made her change from my love to my used to be?
What made her wake from a dream that was only me?
Her last goodbye in my heart will forever ring
She walked away and there went my everything

What made her change from my love to somebody new?
Was it because of the things I forgot to do?
What made it fade like the rays of the setting sun?

And now, I'm gone
You can look for me
Down by the ocean
Cryin' in the deep blue sea

Well, I never thought my baby
Would ever say goodbye
That goes to show
That a man don't know
Just how the cards can lie

[Chorus]

She left me here to weep and moan
Nothin' but the doggone blues
I've made my bid
But she flipped her lid
And now I've got the walkin' shoes

And so, I'm gone
You can look for me
Down by the ocean
Cryin' in the deep blue sea

Well, the tears I shed this mornin'
And the tears I shed last night
I cried, by gosh
But it just can't wash
My baby from my sight

[Chorus]

When I looked out on the ocean
Lord, it was deep and wide
Well, my baby's gone
And I can't go on
So I hung my little head and cried

[Chorus]

Where?

Down by the ocean
Cryin' in the deep blue sea",Cryin' in the Deep Blue Sea
Hank Thompson,"My sweetheart is gone and I'm so lonely
He said that he and I were through
I started out drinkin' for pastime
Drivin' nails in my coffin over you

I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin
Every time I drink a bottle of booze
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin
Drivin' those nails over you

Ever since the day that we parted
I've been so sad and so blue
I'm always thinkin' of you, love
And I just can't quit drinkin' that old booze

I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin
Every time I drink a bottle of booze
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin
Drivin' those nails over you

You turned me down, you don't want me
There's nothin' now I can loose

All you do is run me down
Now we're parted

You're tellin' all your friends
What a rascal I have been
Now we're parted
How cold hearted can you get?

I remember back when I was
Tall hog at the trough
Now my money's gone
And you have really fluffed me off

You're giving me the blame
You ought to hang your head in shame

Now gal, I can't forget
How you got me deep in debt
Now we're parted

You said as you slammed the door
I was square as a four by four
Now we're parted
How cold hearted can you get?

You called me every thing you could
From a dummy to a dope
I know that you'd be satisfied
If I took strychnine and croaked

When I say that you'll regret
You just puff that cigarette
Now we're parted
How cold hearted can you get?

All the lies you've told on me
You'll regret someday

""Now gal, just go the other way""

Hank Thompson,"Every evening when the sun goes down I sit here in my room
And the lamplight streaming over me projects my lonely gloom
My counterpart in agony mocks each tear that falls
And I cast a lonesome shadow on these lonely, lonely walls

He's always by my side at night no matter where I go
He lurks out in the darkness or in the neon's glow
He follows me across the steps and up and down the hall
And I cast a lonesome shadow on these lonely, lonely walls

I sit and watch the candle and the flicker of the flame
My writhing shadow twists and turns as though it is in pain
I'm trying to escape the memory my mind recalls
And I cast a lonesome shadow on these lonely, lonely walls

The image of a love I lost and all the things I'd planned
Are as empty as this bottle that I hold in my hand
My soul is buried in the depths of love and life's pitfalls
And I cast a lonesome shadow on these lonely, lonely walls

I cast a lonesome shadow on these lonely, lonely walls",I Cast a Lonesome Shadow
Hank Thompson,"SWING WIDE YOUR GATE OF LOVE
Writers Hank Thompson, S. Nathan

Swing wide your gate of love, open wide up your heart
I knew when I first met you that you'd be my sweetheart
Swing wide your gate of love and please don't let me fall
I know you're gonna love me after all
(Chorus)
Swing wide the gate and leave it open
Towards the center of your heart I'll be bound
And I'll mend the heart that has been broken
I'm not the kind of guy to let you down
So, swing wide your gate of love, open it for me
For you are the one I want, my darlin', can't you see
Make up your mind to like me and to be my turtledove
I love you, so swing wide your gate of love
(Repeat chorus)
(Repeat last verse)



",Swing Wide Your Gate of Love
Hank Thompson,"Every room seems empty now since she's gone away
The music of her laughter is a thing of yesterday
The patter of her footsteps when she'd meet me at the door
The smiling face I loved to see is gone forever more

I see a cozy love seat when we used to sit and talk
My tears fall on the carper where my sweet baby used to walk

A dozen other women I might get to take her place
But none to touch her sweetness, none would have her grace
When her footsteps pleaded from me, it cut me like a sword
A goodbye told me, she was gone, my baby I adore

I see a cozy love seat when we used to sit and talk
My tears fall on the carper where my sweet baby used to walk

",This Train
Hank Thompson,"Now I was down upon my luck
And the jobs were hard to find
I was sort of short on cash
And my bills were way behind

So I went to see my life long friend
An old man now by trade
I figured it's how he had help me out
With his fortune he had made

I said, 'Old pal, I need your help
I hate to be so bold
But remember when I saved your life
Down at the swimming hole'

Now I'd like to ask a favor
If you can see your way
I'd like to have a little loan?
And then I heard him say

Excuse me total stranger
I can't seem to recall
Are you absolutely certain
That we've ever met at all?

""I'd really like to help you out?
As he opened wide the door
So long total stranger
That I've never seen before?

Now once I had a girlfriend
Who really caught my eye
And when the wife was out of town
Well, I'd court her on the sly

We'd taken all the nightclubs
And honky tonk around
Join at all the parties
And really do the town

But then one night my wife came home
She must have smelled a rat
She looked around from place to place
And found where I was at

Well, there we were all cuddled up
I knew that I was dead
But before my wife could say a word
I jumped right up and said

She's just a total stranger
Who came in off the streets
The place is kinda crowded
So I offered her a seat""

""Now, I couldn't leave this lady
Just a standin' on the floor
She's just a total stranger
That I've never seen before?

My friend said let's go huntin'
I've got the gun and chills
The birds are really flyin'
And I think we'll do quite well

He killed a half a dozen
Then said, I supposed
I really ought to tell you
That the huntin' season's closed?

About that time he heard a noise
And he ducked behind a tree
He took the gun, shelled some birds
And gave them all to me

Up stepped the old game warden
And found me standing there
Before I had a chance to talk
I heard my friend declare

He's just a total stranger
And I was passing by
I saw this total stranger
Shoot those birds out of the sky?

It's a shame the way some people
The laws they do ignore
Like this total stranger
That I've never seen before?",Total Stranger
Hank Thompson,"Today I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you

Then suddenly I got that old time feeling I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you and hold you just the way I used to do
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you I can't help it if I'm still in love with you",I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love With You)
Hank Thompson,"Just a rolling stone all alone and lost
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I pass by all the people say
Just another guy down the lost highway

I was just a lad nearly twenty two
Not bad not good just a kid like you
But now I'm lost too late to pray
Lord I'm rolling down that lost highway

Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies make a life like mine
Oh the day we met I went astray
I started rolling down that lost highway

Now boys don't start to rambling round
On this road of sin or you're sorrow bound
Take my advice or you curse the day
You started rolling down that lost highway",Lost Highway
Hank Thompson,"There it stands in the corner with the barrel so straight 
I looked out the window and over the gate 
The big, fat rabbits are a-jumpin' in the grass 
Wait'll they hear my old shotgun blast 

Shotgun Boogie, I done saw your tracks 
Look out Mr. Rabbit when I cock my hammer back 
Well, over on the ridge is a scaly bark 

Hick'ry nuts so big you can see 'em in the dark 
The big fat squirrels they scratch and they bite 
I'll be on that ridge before daylight 

Shotgun Boogie, all I need is one shot 
Look out bushy tail, tonight you'll be in the pot 
Well, I met a pretty gal, she was tall and thin 
I asked her what she had, she said, ""A Fox Four-Ten"" 
I looked her up and down and said, ""Boy, this is love"" 
So we headed for the brush to shoot a big fat dove 

Shotgun Boogie, boy the feathers flew 
Look out Mister Dove when she draws a bead on you 
I sat down on a log, took her on my lap 
She said, ""Wait a minute, bub, you got to see my Pap 
He's got a sixteen-gauge choked down like a rifle 
He don't like a man that's a-gonna trifle"" 

Shotgun Boogie, draws a bead so fine 
Look out big boy, he's loaded all the time 
Well, I called on her Pap like a gentleman oughta 
He said, ""No brush hunter's gonna get my daughter"" 

He cocked back the hammer right on the spot 
When the gun went off, I outran the shot 
Shotgun Boogie, I wanted wedding bells 
I'll be back little gal, when your pappy runs out of shells",Shotgun Boogie
Hank Thompson,"I turn your hole card upside down
I caught you cheatin' and runnin' around
There's a smile upon your face while another takes my place
And now at last dear the truth I'd found

Babe there's the green light you're free to go
You'll take a high road I'll take the low
Here's your coat and shoes and don't forget your blues
You're on canoe now you'll have to row

Babe there's the green light shift your gear
I know you fooled me for all these years
I'll hold my head up high and forget you by and by
And there'll be laughter instead of tears

Babe there's the green light kick up your heels
There'll come a day you know how it feels
To have your aces trump and be taken for a chump
Now there's the green light so spin your wheels",Green Light

Railroad train, railroad train, hurry some more; Put a little steam on just like never before. Hustle on, bustle on, I've got the blues, Yearning for my Swanee shore. Brother if you only knew, you'd want to hurry up, too. (Refrain:) Down yonder, someone beckons to me, Down yonder, someone reckons on me. I seem to see a race in memory Between the Natchez and the Robert E. Lee. Swanee shore, I miss you more and more; Ev'ryday, my mammy land, you're simply grand Down yonder, when the folks get the news, Don't wonder at the hullabaloo. There's Daddy and Mammy, there's Ephram and Sammy, Waitin' down yonder for me. Summer night, fields of white, bright cotton moon ? My, but I feel glad I'm gonna see you all soon! 'Lasses cakes mammy bakes, I taste them now. I'll see my sweetie once more, There's lots of kissing in store.

Like a breeze that blows I've got to ramble

I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' 44 beneath my head

Woke up next mornin' grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
I made a good run but I went too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico

Late in the hot joints smokin' the pill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down

Yes oh yes my name is Willy Lee
If you've got the warrant just read it to me
Shot her cold cause she made me sore
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more

Put me on the train I was dressed in black
Came the sherriff and he brought me back
Had no one for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that country jail

And next morning along about nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
Ah and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court

Into the courtroom trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw the little judge commence to look about

In about five minutes in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I hollered Lowdy Lowdy have a mercy on me

Judge he smiled as he picked up his ben

Everybody drinkin' good liquor the regular crowd was there
So I strolled out on the sidewalk began to look around
Looking everywhere for my baby but that sweet woman can't be found
It was down at St James infirmary I found my baby there
Stretched out on a long white table so cold so pale so fair
So I strolled back down to the barroom to get another drink of gin
The next thing you know I'm reeling rocking and drunk again
Sixteen coal black horses all hitched up in a line
In that pretty buggy she's ridin' goodbye ol' gal of mine

Your little world will fall apart and that will be the day
You're gonna need a certain guy and be left settin' high and dry

Oh dear I'm so tired and so lonely I wonder why mommy don't come
She told me to close my pretty blue eyes and when I awoke she'd be home
I guess I'll go down and find daddy I think he went down to the store
That big long room filled with bottles I wish that he'd go there no more
Sometimes he's so sick when he come from he staggers and falls on the ground
One night when came in the parlor he kicked my poor dolly around
But I love him and I guess I'll go find him I know he would gladly come home
Then it won't be so dark and so lonesome while waiting for money to come
His red eyes gazed wild when she found him her sweet smiling face was still fair
But too late the demon possessed him for he grabbed at the back of a chair
In a moment the whole thing was over the work of the beast was complete
And a poor little innocent blossom lay dying at her daddy's knees

It's plain to see that you and me could get along just fine

Hank Thompson,"IN THE JAILHOUSE NOW
(Jimmie Rodgers)
Â« Â© '28 Peer International Â»

I had a friend named Rambling Bob who used to steal gamble and rob
He thought he was the smartest guy in town
But I found out last Monday that Bob got locked up Sunday
They've got him in the jailhouse way downtown
He's in the jailhouse now he's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice to quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now
He played the game called poker he knocked all with an yoker
But shootin' dice was his greatest game
Now he's downtown in jail nobody's to go his bail
The judge done said that he'll refuse to find
He's in the jailhouse now...
Now I went out last Tuesday met a girl named Susie
I told her I was the swellest man around
We started to spend my money and she started to callin' me honey
We took in every cabaret in town
We're in the jailhouse now we're in the jailhouse now
I've told the judge right to his face we didn't like to see this place
We're in the jailhouse now

Oh me, oh my, do I feel high.

Oh, what a spell you've got me in, 
Oh my, do I feel high.

People won't believe me, 
They'll think that I'm just braggin'
That I could feel the way I feel, 
And still be on the wagon. 

All I need is one of your smiles, 
Sunshine of your eyes, oh me, oh my, 
Do I feel higher than a kite can fly!
Give me lovin', baby, I feel high.

They give him his orders at Monroe, Virginia Sayin', ""Steve you're way behind time This is not Thirty-Eight, but it's old Ninety-Seven You must put her in Spencer on time"" Then he looked 'round and said to his black greasy fireman ""Just shovel in a little more coal And when we cross that white oak mountain You can watch old Ninety-Seven roll"" It's a mighty rough road from Lynchburg to Danville In a line on a three mile grade It was on that grade where he lost his airbrakes So you see what a jump he made He was goin' down grade makin' ninety miles an hour And his whistle broke into a scream He was found in the wreck, with his hand on the throttle And scalded to death by the steam Now, ladies, you must all take warning From this time on and learn Never speak harsh words to your true lovin' husband He may leave you and never return

Hank Thompson,"He walked into the bar and parked his lanky frame upon a tall bar stool
With a long soft southern drawl said I'll just have a glass of anything that's cool
A barroom girl with wise and knowing eyes slowly looked me up and down
And she said I wonder how on earth that country bumpkin found his way to town
And she said hello country bumpkin
How's the frost out on the pumpkin
I've seen some sights but man you're somethin'
Where'd you come from country bumpkin
Just a short year later in a bed of joy filled tears and death like pain
Into this wondrous world of many wonders another wonder came
That same woman's face was wrapped up in a raptured look of love and tenderness 
As I marveled at the soft and warm and cuddly boy child feeding at her breast
And she said hello country bumpkin
Fresh as frost out on the pumpkins
I've seen some sights but babe you're somethin'
Mommy loves her country bumpkin
Forty years of hard work later in a simple quiet and peaceful country place
The heavy hand of time had not erased the raptured wonder from my woman's face
She was lying on her death bed knowing fully well her race was nearly run
But she softly smiled and looked into the sad eyes of her husband and her son
And I said so long country bumpkins
The frost is gone now from the pumpkins
I've seem some sights and life's been somethin's
See you later country bumpkins see you later country bumpkins",Country Bumpkin
Hank Thompson,"We tried to pick the most unlikely places
Where no one's out to know us by our name
And for a while we shared the sweet affection
That makes it worth the sorrow and the shame
A lovin' on back streets and livin' on main
Suffered hell through the daylight for the heaven darkness brings
Two hearts in the shadows tradin' passion for pain
A lovin' on back streets and livin' on main
In the morning when I face the one who owns me
And she comfronts me with some things I can't explain
Then once again I hate myself for living
And wonder just how long my mind can stand this strain

And the cigarette smoke kind-a hangs in the air
Red-necks, white socks and blue rib-bon beer
A cow-boy is cussin' the pin-ball ma-chine
A drunk at the bar is get-tin' noisy and mean

Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't you free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't you free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from lies, to try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart?","Cold, Cold, Heart"

I can't even spell my name, my head's in such a spin
Today I tried to eat a steak with a big old tablespoon
You got me chasin' rabbits, walkin' on my hands and howlin' at the moon

Well sug', I took one look at you and it almost drove me mad
And then I even went and lost what little sense I had
Now I can't tell the day from night, I'm crazy as a loon
You got me chasin' rabbits, pullin' out my hair and howlin' at the moon

Some friends of mine asked me to go out on a huntin' spree
'Cause there ain't a hound dog in this state that can hold a light to me
I eat three bones for dinner today, then tried to tree a 'coon
You got me chasin' rabbits, scratchin' fleas and howlin' at the moon

I rode my horse to town today and a gas pump we did pass
I pulled 'im up and I a-hollered whoa, said fill 'im up with gas
The man picked up a monkey wrench and wham, he changed my tune
You got me chasin' rabbits, spittin' out teeth and howlin' at the moon

I never thought in this old world, a fool could fall so hard
But honey baby, when I fell the whole world must have jarred
I think I'd quit my doggish ways if you'd take me for your groom
You got me chasin' rabbits, pickin' out rings and howlin' at the moon",Howlin' at the Moon

'Cause I'm afraid of church bells, how they scare me when they chime

Hank Williams,"Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian, standin' by the door
He fell in love with an indian maid, over in the antique store
Kaw-Liga, ooh
Just stood there, and never let it show
So she could never answer yes or no

He always wore his Sunday feathers, and held a tomahawk
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
Kaw-Liga, ooh
To stubborn to ever show a sign
Because his heart is made of knotty pine

Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, he never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, he don't know what he missed
Is it any wonder that his face is red?
Kaw-Liga, that poor old wooden head

Kaw-Liga was a lonely Indian, never went nowhere
His heart was set on the Chocktaw maid with the coal-black hair
Kaw-Liga, ooh
Just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer yes or no

And then one day, a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
And took her oh-so far away but ol' Kaw-Liga stayed
Kaw-Liga, ooh
Just stands there, as lonely as can be
And wishes he were still an ol' pine tree

Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, he never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, he don't know what he missed
Is it any wonder, that his face is red?

Too many boyfriends and sociable gals may drive your sweetheart away
Gentlemen of the jury the judge's speech began

The scene was a crowded courtroom and the judge a stern old man

A lady of the evening and you know the penalty

Her eyes reflect the nightlife her cheeks they're red with paint
But I knew her mother gentlemen why her mother was a saint
Now I know that she's not like her and yet she might have been
If it hadn't been for pettin' parties cigarettes and gin

We took the night life off the streets and brought it in our own homes
While girls beguiled with lipstick danced to saxophones
We opened up the underworld to the ones we loved so well
So tell me gentlemen is it right to send her to a cell

If she drinks while you taught her and if she smokes you showed her how
So gentlemen do you think it's right to condemn her now
And when you're in that jury room just remember there and then
That for every fallen woman there's a hundred fallen men
And before you render a verdict on what this girl has done

Just remember there's a man to blame and that man might be your son

Then bows his head that his shame he might hide
But when they lifted his head they found he was dead

I'm gonna tuck my worries underneath my arm

Hank Williams,"Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old-time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh, heaven only knows how much I miss you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you",I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love With You)

Oh, the woman on our party line's the nosiest thing
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring
Why don't you mind your own business
(Mind your own business)
Well, if you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine

I got a little gal that wears her hair up high
The boys all whistle when she walks by
Why don't you mind your own business
(Mind your own business)
Well, if you mind your own business, you sure won't be minding mine

If I want to honky tonk around 'til two or three
Now, brother that's my headache, don't you worry 'bout me
Just mind your own business

That I was glad to see you go
I could hate you for the way I'm feelin'

It's a sin to make me cry
When you know I love you so
I could tell my heart that I don't miss you
My lips could tell a lie, but my heart would know

I could give you all the blame
But I'm sure the truth would show
I could tell this world I've found a new love

'Till I hear an old freight

Sometimes it's hard

A-passin' by
And to ride these rails

You wanted me to see you change your name
I couldn't stand to see you wed another

Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
That should be ringing out for you and me
Down the aisle with someone else you're walking
Those wedding bells will never ring for me

I planned a little cottage in the valley
I even bought a little band of gold
I thought some day I'd place it on your finger
But now the future looks so dark and cold

Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
I hear the children laughing out with glee
At home alone I hang my head in sorrow
Those wedding bells will never ring for me

I fancy that I see a bunch of roses
A blossom from an orange tree in your hair
And while the organ plays I love you truly
Please let me pretend that I am there

I knew someday that you would wed another

Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind,and melt your cold cold heart

You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life,to try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you,the more we drift apart

In your loveless mansion on the hill

I've waited all through the years love
To give you a heart true and real

Just to know that you're my son makes my heart swell with pride
I've always needed one like you to love and understand
Now that you've come to fill that place, you're my buddy, man to man.

There comes a time when every boy grows so cocksure with life
So that he feels he knows it all and no longer needs advice
The complicated phase of life is called ""adolescent age""
And sometimes breaks a father's heart, wish you could skip that stage.

I'd like to help you fill your heart with kindness, faith and truth
Protect you from the hands that reach out to destroy manhood and you
There is so much sorrow and despair to blight the hearts of men
And the more we learn of love and life, the more they come crowding in.

It's just little things at first, my son, then, as we grow older
Our troubles grow much bigger too and sometimes, they overflow
The poisoned minds and broken hearts will cause strongest men to weep
Overwhelm souls with bitterness and death would be so sweet.

So we must build a strong defense of love and fortitude
On character and knowledge, son, so these ills cannot intrude
Ah, sonny boy, so many things a youngster needs to know
If he is to find true happiness as down through this life he goes.

It's just a father's love, I guess, that comes to every dad
That makes me want to shelter you from things that make you sad

Hank Williams,"A little girl prayed at the close of the day,
Cause her daddy had gone far away,
On her little face was a look of despair,
I stood there and listened, and I heard this prayer
My Mommie says daddy has brought us to shame
And I'm never no more to mention his name
Lord take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Oh heavenly father help me understand

You know friends I wonder
Just how many homes are broken tonight
And just how many tears are shed
By some little word of anger
That never should have been said

I'd like to tell you a story
Of a family I once knew.
We'll call them Mary and William
And their little daughter sue

Now Mary was just a plain mother
And bill was just a usual dad
And they had their little family quarrels
(Like everybody else)
But neither one really got mad

Then one day something happened
It was nothing of course
But one word led to another
And the last word led to a divorce

Now here were two grown up people
Who failed to use common sense
They strengthened their own selfish pride
At little Sue's expense

You know she didn't ask to be brought to
This world
To drift from pillar to post
But a divorce never stops to consider
The ones it hurts the most

Could hear little sue say

Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul

I'll break sin's chains and set you free
I'll carry you to a home on high
Where you'll never, never die

Hank Williams,"If you will listen, a song I will sing
About my daddy who drove a log train
Way down in the southland, in old Alabama
We lived in a place that they call Chapmantown

And late in the evening, when the sun was low
Way off in the distance you could hear the train blow
The folks would come runnin', and Moma would say
""Get the supper on the table, here comes the log train""

Every mornin', at the break of day
He'd grab his lunchbucket, and be on his way
Winter or summer, sunshine or rain
Every mornin', he'd run that ole log train

A sweatin' an swearin' all day long
Shoutin', ""Get up there oxen, keep movin' along
Load her up boys, 'cause it looks like rain
I've gotta get rollin', this ole log train""

The log train is silent, God called Dad to go
But when I get to Heaven, ta always remain
I'll listen to the whistle of the ole log train

When I can't get you off of my mind

So you fool every new love you find

And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satis-fied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you.

A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you 
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you.

It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh, heaven only knows how much I miss you

Hank Williams,"In the great book of John you're warned of the day
When you'll be laid beneath the cold clay
The angel of death will come from the sky
And claim your poor soul when the time comes to die

When the angel of death comes down after you
Can you smile and say that you have been true?
Can you truthfully say with your dying breath?
That you're ready to meet the angel of death

When the lights all grow dim and the dark shadows creep
And then your loved ones are gathered to weep
Can you face them and say with your dying breath?
That you're ready to meet the angel of death

When the angel of death comes down after you
Can you smile and say that you have been true?
Can you truthfully say with your dying breath?
That you're ready to meet the angel of death

Death's angels took her away
She's gone to meet Daddy up there in Heaven
But we'll meet again someday

She left this world with a smile on her face
Whispering the Saviour's name

For the city where there is no pain

As I stood by her bedside, those last few moments
I lived my childhood again
I thought of you, Brother and of the old homestead
And my tears, they fell like rain

I heard someone began to weep
Then I got up just to see
I heard my mother praying for me

She was kneeling by her bed
And tears of pain were being shed
She said, ""Dear God, please hear my plea""
I heard my mother praying for me

I got my Bible and sat down
And in the Holy Book I found
The way to end this misery
Thank God, my mother prayed for me

I read it on into the night
And soon began to see the light
And now at last my soul is free

And so He set me free

In the mountains far away
That's where I long to be

Down beneath the clay

We'd meet there every evening
When the sun was sinkin' low
And we'd listen to the waters
As they rippled soft and low

And since she's gone to Heaven
I miss her most of all
Tonight my darlin's sleepin'
By the singing waterfall

I heard my darlin' call
And then I went to meet her

WRITERS HANK WILLIAMS, HANK WILLIAMS JR.

You're letter says you're unhappy we're many miles apart
It's a little late to ask for pity,
Remember you broke your own heart
You walked out on the heart that loved you, has no pity from the start
You cheated and lied and now you're gonna cry,
Remember you broke your own heart
A heart can stand so much sorrow and then it bends and breaks
And a love that is honest and true can turn to bitter hate
Now that you're gone and lonely, and your dreams have fallen apart
Think of the one that once loved you,
Remember you broke your own heart



",You Broke Your Own Heart
Hank Williams,"A tongue can accuse and carry bad news the seeds of distrust it will sow
But unless you've made no mistakes in your life be careful of stones that you throw

And this is what I heard my neighbor say
That bad girl down the street should be run from our midst

She knows not to speak to me or my child my neighbor then smiled and I thought
A tongue can accuse

A car speeded by and the screaming of brakes a sound that made my blood chill
For my neighbor's one child had been pulled from the path
And saved by a girl lying still

We met in the springtime when blossoms unfold
The pastures were green and the meadows were gold
Our love was in flower as summer grew on
Her love like the leaves now has withered and gone.

The roses have faded, there`s frost at my door
The birds in the morning don`t sing anymore
The grass in the valley is starting to die
And out in the darkness the whippoorwills cry.

Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh, Lord, if You hear me please hold to my hand
Oh, please understand.

Oh, where has she gone to, oh, where can she be
She may have forsaken some other like me
She promised to honor, to love and obey
Each vow was a plaything that she threw away.

The darkness is falling, the sky has turned gray
A hound in the distance is starting to ""Bay""
I wonder, I wonder, what she`s thinking of
Forsaken, forgotten, without any love.

Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh, Lord, if You hear me please hold to my hand
Oh, please understand.",Alone and Forsaken

Callin' you?, [callin' you?]
Can't you hear the blessed savior callin' you?
He will take you by the hand
Lead you to that promise land
Can't you hear the blessed savior callin' you? 

As you journey day by day
And temptation	comes your way
Can't you hear the blessed savior callin' you?
If you'll follow in his light
He will always guide you right

And your friends can not be found

Hank Williams,"All day I face
The barren waste
Without the taste
Of water.
Cool Water.

Dan and I,
With throats burned dry
And souls that cry
For water.
Cool, clear water.

The nights are cool,
And I'm a fool.
Each stars a pool
Of water.
Cool, clear water.

And with the dawn
I'll wake and yawn
And carry on
To water.
Cool, clear water.

The Shadows sway
And seem to say,
""Tonight we pray
For water.""
Cool, clear water.

And way up there
He'll hear our prayer
And show us where
There's water.
Cool, clear water.

Keep moving Dan.
Don't you listen to him Dan.
He's the devil not a man.
He spreads the burning sands
With Water.

Say, Dan can't you see
That big green tree
Where the water's running free?
It's waiting there for you and me.

And water
Cool, clear water.

Dan's feet are sore.
He's yearning for
Just one thing more
Than water.
Cool, clear water.

Like me I guess
He'd like to rest
Where there's no quest
For water.
Cool, clear water.",Cool Water
Hank Williams,"Little girl, if you're feeling low
And you got no place to go
Just give me a ring, some joy I will bring
'Cause I ain't got nothin' but time

Well, I ain't got nothin' but time
So baby, if you wanna shine
If you take time to look, my number's in the book
And you can call me any time

I'm footloose and I'm fancy free
So baby, just come along with me
Grab your dancin' shoes, we'll go and lose them blues
'Cause I ain't got nothin' but time

If you say so babe, we'll stay all night
Don't worry, 'cause I ain't got no wife
Any time you wanna go, good gal, just let me know
'Cause I ain't got nothin' but time

No use to sit at home and fine
And let someone trouble your mind
Just come along with me, there's more fish in the sea
And I ain't got nothin' but time

Now baby, just come on and smile
You'll find that life is still worth while
If you just look around and watch the fellars in this town
That for you ain't got nothin' but time

It won't matter with me
For when she went away, my world ended that day

Oh, if I can't have you here, I can't go on my dear
So I don't care if tomorrow never comes.

Praise the Lord I saw the light

Just like a blind man I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light

I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light

I was a fool to wander and stray
Straight is the gate and narrow's the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right

So selfish are we, for silver and gold
You can treasure your wealth, your diamonds and gold

To your earthly wealth, you must say goodbye
Then it's useless to you, if you've strayed from the fold
For my friend it won't save, your poor wicked soul

The rich man like all, will be judged at that time
But all of his wealth, will be left behind
For no matter how much earthly wealth you get hold

And to him these words he did say.

You can see this lad all alone
With his eyes lifted toward heaven

Heading south from Caroline
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

Got in trouble, had to roam
Left my gal an' left my home
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

Just a kid, acting smart
I went and broke my darling's heart
I guess I was too young to know

They took me off the Georgia Main
Locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All alone, I bear the shame
I'm a number, not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All I do is sit an' cry
When the evening train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I'll be locked here in this cell
'Till my body's just a shell
An' my hair turns whiter than snow

I'll never see that gal of mine

It was raining hard but the fiddler didn't care
He sawed away at the popular air
Though his rooftop leaked like a waterfall
That didn't seem to bother the old man at all.

And stopped to hear him a-fiddling away
The cabin was afloat and his feet were wet
But the old man still didn't seem to fret.

You'd better mend your roof said he
But the old man said as he played away
I couldn't mend it now it's a rainy day.

The traveler replied that's all quite true
But this I think is the thing for you to do
Get busy on a day that is fair and bright
Then patch the old roof till it's good and tight.

And tapped the ground with his leathery heel

Keepin' the heavens blue

When I try I'm just wasting my time

Lord, I've tried and I've tried
And all night long I've cried
But I can't get you off of my mind

Didn't think you would leave me behind
But I guess you're the two-timin' kind
Do you think that it's smart
To jump from heart to heart
When I can't get you off of my mind?

You believe that a true love is blind
So you fool every new love you find
You've got stars in your eyes
But they can't hide the lies
God, I can't get you off of my mind

Hank Williams,"Each year on  mother's  day
The rose I  wore was  red
But today I'm saying my first prayer
Mama's lying on her  dying  bed.

I've just told  mama good- bye
Mother's day has  turned to  night
Like the  flowers in may, she  withered away
And my red rose is  turning white.

This is the dreaded hour
We all must face someday
Yet there's consolation in my heart
She will bloom in the master's bouquet.

Her time has come to go
And there's nothing I can do
Only hold her hand and say goodbye
Mama's day with her children is through.

I've just told mama goodbye
And knelt beside her bed
I heard her say, ""I'll meet you someday,
Where the white roses turn to red.""",I've Just Told Mama Goodbye

Hank Williams,"One time you know, I loved you true
There was nothing I wouldn't do
But you have treated me so bad
You killed all the love I ever had

You leave me alone and run around
You were the talk of the town
It made you glad to see me sad
You killed all the love I ever had

No one knows the torture I went through
Loving you and knowing you were untrue
It's over now and I'm so glad
You killed all the love I ever had

All these years I've sat and cried
A thousand times my poor soul died
You have treated me so bad
You killed all the love I ever had
",All the Love I Ever Had
Hank Williams,"I talked with a stranger - so sad and forlorn
His garments were sackcloth - all tattered and torn
He told me a story - of sorrow and woe
His heart went to heaven - at the first fall of snow

He spoke of his angel - a dear, baby girl
He loved every footstep - he loved every curl
But she went to heaven - just one year ago
The angels came for her - at the first fall of snow

He still had the dolly - that she used to love
He held and caressed it - and gazed up above
He whispered my baby - You're waiting, I know
I'll bring you, your dolly - at the first fall of snow

And there as I listened - my eyes filled with tears
I knew she was part of - his happier years
His frail body trembled - he spoke soft and low
I'll be with my baby - at the first fall of snow

I patted his shoulder - my feelings to hide
He couldn't know - I was crying inside
He smiled as we parted - 'cause he didn't know
That we lost our baby - at the first fall of snow",At the First Fall of Snow
Hank Williams,"Should you go first and I remain to walk the road alone
I'll live in memory's garden dear with happy days we've known
In spring I'll wait for roses red, when fades the lilacs bloom
And in early fall when brown leaves fall, I'll catch a glimpse of you

Should you go first and I remain, for battles to be fought
Each thing you've touched along the way, will be a hallowed spot
I'll hear your voice I'll see your smile though blindly I may grope
The memory of your helping hand will buoy me on with hope

Beyond the sunset, oh blissful morning
When with our savior, heaven is begun
Earth's toiling ended, oh glory dawning
Beyond the sunset when day is done

Should you go first and I remain, to finish with the scroll
No lessening shadows shall ever creep in to make this life seem droll
We've known so much of happiness, we've had our cup of joy
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy

I want to know each step you take that I may walk the same
For someday down that lonely road, you'll hear me call your name
Should you go first and I remain, one thing I'll have you do
Walk slowly down that long long path, for soon I'll follow you

In that fair homeland, we'll know no parting
Beyond the sunset for ever more
",Beyond the Sunset
Hank Williams,"Once I was happy as I could be

The barren waste
Without the taste
Of water.

With throats burned dry
And souls that cry
For water.

The nights are cool,
And I'm a fool.
Each stars a pool
Of water.

And with the dawn
I'll wake and yawn
And carry on
To water.

And seem to say,
""Tonight we pray
For water.""

And way up there
He'll hear our prayer
And show us where
There's water.

Don't you listen to him Dan.
He's the devil not a man.
He spreads the burning sands
With Water.

That big green tree
Where the water's running free?
It's waiting there for you and me.

And water
Cool, clear water.

There was a note upon my door
Said ""don't make me no coffee babe
'Cause I won't be back no more""

Now Jonah got along in the belly of the whale
Daniel in the lion's den
But I know a guy that didn't try to get along
And he won't get a chance again
And that's all she wrote (dear John)
I've fetched your saddle home

Now,she didn't forward no address
Nor she didn't say goodbye
All she said was ""if you get blue
Just hang your little head and cry""

Now my gal's short and stubby
She's strong as she can be
But if that little old gal of mine
Ever get's ahold of me

To see my uncle Bill and sorta pass the time away
I asked him how he'd been since last, I'd passed his way
He rubbed his chin, here's what he had to say

My wife's been sick, the young ones, too
And I'm darn near down with the flu
The cow's gone dry and them hens won't lay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The hogs took the cholera and they've all done died
The bees got mad and they left the hive
The weevils got the corn and the rain rotted the hay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The porch rotted down that's more expense
The darned old mule he tore down the fence
The mortgage is due and I can't pay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The cow broke in the field and eat up the beans
The darn rabbits they got the turnip greens
And my ma-in-law just moved in to stay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

My land's so poor so hard and yeller
You have to set on a sack of fertilizer to raise an umbreller
And it rains out here nearly every day
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The wells gone dry and I have to tote the water
Up from the spring about a mile and a quarter
My helper, he quit for the lack of pay
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The house it leaks it needs a new top
When it rains it wets everything we got
The chimney fell down just yesterday
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The corn meals gone and the meat's run out
Got nothin' to kill to put in the smokehouse
The preacher's comin' Sunday to spend the day
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

The canned stuffs spoiled else the jar's got broke
And all we got left is one old Billy goat
We're gonna have a new baby about the first of may
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay

My crop it rotted in the ground
I asked for another loan but the banker turned me down
But we're still a-livin' and we're prayin' for better days

When flowers are bloomin' beneath the moon 
And ya light of love is shinin' bright 
An you tell ya self tonight's the night

An on ya knees where you would propose
When somethin' bights you on the nose, fly trouble

Just a little old shanty by a railroad track,
The hummin' of the drivers was my lullaby,
And a freight train whistle taught me how to cry.

I've got the freight train blues, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Got 'em in the bottom of my ramblin' shoes,
And when that whistle blows, I've gotta go, 
Oh! Lordy! guess I'm never gonna lose,
The mean old freight train blues.

Was the only daughter of an en-gin- eer,
My sister married a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Now it's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.

Hank Williams,"I was walking in Savannah past a church, decayed and dim
When slowly through the window came a plaintive funeral hymn
My sympathy awakened and a wonder quickly grew
'Til I found myself environed in a little colored pew

Out front a colored couple sat in sorrow nearly wild
On the altar was a casket and in the casket was a child
I could picture him while living, curly hair protruding lips
I'd seen perhaps a thousand in my hurried southern trips

Then rose a sad, old colored preacher from his little wooden desk
With a manner sort of awkward and countenance grotesque
The simplicity and shrewdness in his Ethiopian face
Showed the wisdom and the ignorance of a crushed, undying race

And he said, ""Now don't be weepin' for this pretty bit of clay
For the little boy who lived there has done gone and run away
He was doing very finely and he 'ppreciates your love
But his sho nough father wanted him in the big house up above

The Lord didn't give you that baby, by no hundred thousand miles
He just think you need some sunshine and he lent it for a while
And he let you keep and love him 'til your hearts were bigger grown
And these silver tears you're shedding now, are just interest on the loan

Just think my poor dear mourners creeping long on sorrow?s way
What a blessed picnic this here baby got today
Your good fathers and good mothers crowd the little fella round
In the angels 'tender garden of the big plantation ground

And his eyes they brightly sparkle at the pretty things he view
But a tear came and he whispered, ""I want my parents too""
Then the angel's chief musicians teach that little boy a song
Says if only they be faithful, they'll soon be comin' 'long

And so my poor dear mourners, let your hearts with Jesus rest
And don't go to criticizn' the one what knows the best
He has give us many comforts He's got the right to take away
To the Lord be praised in glory, now and ever, let us pray

Hank Williams,"I've just been to heaven with someone so true
I dreamed about mama last night
She read me the Bible like she used to do
I dreamed about mama last night

She never close her eyes and sleep till we were all in bed
And on party nights till we came home she often sat and read
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay
Just how much mama worried when we children were away

We only knew she never slept when we were out at night
That she waited just to know that we'd all come home alright
Why sometimes when we'd stay away till one or two or three
It seemed to us that mama heard the turnin' of the key

For always when we'd step aside she'd call and we'd reply
But we were all too young back then to understand the reason why
Until the last one had returned she'd always keep a light
For mama couldn't sleep until she kissed us all goodnight

She had to know that we were safe before she went to rest
Well she seemed to fear that the world might harm
The ones that she loved the best
And once she told me when you're grown to women and to men
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through I may be different then

And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care
That always when we got back home we'd find her waitin' there
Then came the night that we were called together round her bed
The children are all with you now the kindly doctor said

And in her eyes the gleam again that old time tender light
That told that she's just been waitin' to know we were alright
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep
Her children safe from harm throughout the years
And then she went to sleep

My dream is a treasure that I'll always keep

And get no lovin' in return
And I just don't like this kind of livin'

Why do we stay together
We always fuss and fight
You ain't never known to be wrong
And I ain't never been right

Tell me where you think we're goin'
'Cause I ain't got no way of knowin'
When things go wrong, you go your way
You leave me here, to pay and pay
And I just don't like this kind of livin'

I just don't like the things you're doin'
Your evil heart will be your ruin
When things start runnin' smooth and free
You haul right off and you pick on me
And I just don't like this way of livin'

They say the road of love is long
It's rocky and it's rough
But if this road don't start to get smooth
I've traveled it long enough

Why don't you act a little older
And get that chip off of your shoulder

That to morrow you'll be wed,
You thought that you would hurt me,
But you hurt yourself instead,

I'll always be the same old pal,
Just as in years gone by,
I'll just set back and watch you,
While you set alone and cry.

[Chorus]
Tears fallin' down your pretty cheeks,
Tears you cannot hide and tears you cannot keep,
They are tears of sorrow and tears of delight,
I wish I had a nickel, for every tear you shed last night.

I just dropped by to tell you that I wish you happiness,
I hope that you'll forgive me for intruding like this,
I hope my dear your happiness will follow through the years,
I'll just set back and watch you, while you shed those bitter tears.

Cause I'm afraid of church bells how they scare me when they chime

I'm sorry for you, my friend

You tried to make her blue
She tagged along through right and wrong
Because she worshiped you
You know that you're the one to blame
There's no use to pretend
Today's the day you start to pay
I'm sorry for you, my friend

Today, as she walked arm-in-arm
At someone else's side

Jesus died for me long ago

What pain He suffered there, the holy one, so dear
So that you and I could live, I'll try to repay
For His sufferin' on that day, Jesus died for me long ago

He was tortured and slain, God bless His Holy name

Standing with all the angels on a golden stair

Last night I dreamed of Heaven and it filled my heart with joy

I heard the angels singing songs of peace and rest
And then there was a silence, each eye looked toward the west
There sat my Saviour on His golden throne
Last night I dreamed of Heaven, my eternal home sweet home

Last night I dreamed of Heaven that land so pure and sweet
And the joy within me made my glad heart weep

I told her that I'd spend the rest of my days
On the banks of the old Pontchartrain.

I just couldn't tell her that I ran away
From jail on a West Texas plain
I prayed in my heart I would never be found
On the banks of the old Pontchartrain.

Then one day a man put his hand on my arm
And said I must go west again
I left her alone without saying goodbye
On the banks of the old Pontchartrain.

Tonight as I sit here alone in my cell
I know that she's waiting in vain
I'm hoping and praying someday to return
On the banks of the old Pontchartrain",On the Banks of the Old Pontchartrain
Hank Williams,"Listen poor sinner; you`re driftin` away 
From the Dear Saviour; who`s pleading to- day
What will you do; when the Saviour ain`t  nigh
When the Pale Horse and his rider goes  by?

The time now ain`t long; when the Saviour will come
Then you`ll be judged; by the deeds you have done
On that judgment day; you`ll weep and you`ll cry
When the Pale Horse and his rider goes by?

When that trumpet sounds; on the sinners below
Not even the angels; in heaven will know
Then`s when you`ll wish; you had Jesus nigh
When the Pale Horse and his rider goes by?

Won`t you redeem; your poor wicked soul
You can`t pay your way; with Silver and Gold
If you`re not saved; you`ll be lost in the night
When the Pale Horse and his rider goes by?",The Pale Horse and His Rider
Hank Williams,"There's coming a day when the world shall melt away
And Jesus shall come to claim his own
No more tears no pain no woe in this wicked world below
Then will you be ready to go home
Will you be ready to go ready to go home to live with him up there round the throne
When he says come unto me will your soul be claim and free
Then will you be ready to go home

In this world of greed and hate will you wait till it's too late
Too late to claim the Savior for your own
For he's coming someday to bear your soul away then will you be ready to go home
Will you be ready to go,
Then will you be ready to go home",Ready to Go Home
Hank Williams,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.

Hank Williams,"At first when I heard of some people who claim
That the old-time religion was real
I said ""I'll go down, take a look at the crowd
For just that weak-minded I feel.""

I walked up the steps and I peeked in the door
But the devil said, ""don't you go in!""
But I said, ""it won't hurt me I'll just step inside
And I'll set as far back as I can."" (but-)

[Chorus]
Something got a hold of me (praise god)
Yes something got a hold of me (oh! lord)
I went there to fight, but I'll tell you that night
God certainly got a hold of me.

They sang like they meant it, they all clapped their hands
I said, ""it's commotion, that's all.""
""when they get down to pray, I'll just get up and leave
For I don't wanta be seen here at all.""

But I bowed that time, he got started to preach
And he looked straight down at me
He told ev'rybody how mean that I was
He didn't talk like he thought much of me.

I sat in my seat just thinkin' it o'er
And then they all started to pray
The fire fell from heaven, I fell to the floor
I prayed there and God had his way. (for-)

Hank Williams,"Her eyes were blue, her hair was auburn
Her smile was like an angel fair
She was her daddy's only daughter

[Chorus]
One night I took a ride just across the line
I picked her up in a pickup truck
And she broke this heart of mine
Her mama said, ""No-o, she's my only daughter,""

We'll be strong enough to face our last goodbye
Darling if our romance ends let us part as best of friends

There's no room in my memory for tears
We left back on and be forgotten souvenirs

Too many boyfriends and sociable gals may drive your sweetheart away

The scene was a crowded courtroom and the judge a stern old man
This prisoner here before you is a social enemy
A lady of the evening and you know the penalty

Her eyes reflect the nightlife her cheeks they're red with paint
But I knew her mother gentlemen why her mother was a saint
Now I know that she's not like her and yet she might have been
If it hadn't been for pettin' parties cigarettes and gin

We took the night life off the streets and brought it in our own homes
While girls beguiled with lipstick danced to saxophones
We opened up the underworld to the ones we loved so well
So tell me gentlemen is it right to send her to a cell

If she drinks while you taught her and if she smokes you showed her how
So gentlemen do you think it's right to condemn her now
And when you're in that jury room just remember there and then
That for every fallen woman there's a hundred fallen men
And before you render a verdict on what this girl has done

Just remember there's a man to blame and that man might be your son

Leave the road of sin alone, let Jesus lead you home

On His head the thorns did lay
