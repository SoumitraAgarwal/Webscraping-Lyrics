Adam Green,"Skelton of a smoking plane
Catch a train to an open vein

The smoke just cleared
Something went wrong
The catfish choked
The sky is gone
Beneath their boats
The forecast floats
The joystick choked
The joystick smokes

Mariachi clothes look good on everyone
Klu Klux Klansman dance around the mountain
Plugging up the holes in their harmonicas

Push away from the overdose
Just in time for the ferryboats",Broken Joystick
Adam Green,"She used to live with an indian chief
Who gave her the clap that he got from a priest
Night after night, I would lay with her pets
Like a mailorder bride in a box by the steps
She went bungee jumping,
One fine day
Off the cliffs of our friendship,
And at the bottom she stayed
When they told me that her body was found
An astrounat drowned in the long island sound
I tripped down the stairs in my basketball shoes
And paddled down stream in my father's canoe
In the kingdom of bungee
The castle's been stained
But the kingdom of incest
Still has a mighty fine name",Bungee
Adam Green,"Bind me, gag me take me to the bunnyranch. 
People dying kill me in the packing house. 
Even you have to win sometimes dear. 
Poison needle smoker, 
Break a broken window mind you. 
One kiss, two kiss I can make it look like that. 
Do me dolly, rape me in the parking lot. 

Even you have to win sometimes dear. 
Poison needle smoker, break a broken window mind you. 
Bind me, gag me take me to the bunnyranch. 
Bind me gag me take me to the bunnyranch. 
Those are the only songs from friends of mine that I have heard so far, 
Considering I don't live in the UK. 
I hope these lyrics helped you some",Bunnyranch
Adam Green,"And we live on borrowed time,
But this headshot's pretty good
I've been scheming for too long,
I was starstruck by your mom

We fall in love by accident,
A heavenly coincidence
No matter what you think is true
Let me introduce you to some,

Friends of mine
Oh, friends of mine
Oh, friends of mine
Oh, friends of mine

And we brake for passing cars,
In the pistol ripping chase
I regret the drugs you lost,
So I skipped our second date

We fall in love by accident,
A heavenly coincidence
No matter what you think is true
Let me introduce you to some,

Friends of mine
Oh, friends of mine
Oh, friends of mine
Oh, friends of mine

We fall in love by accident,
A heavenly coincidence
No matter what you think is true
Let me introduce you to

Can't figure out this place
Guess someone hates my guts
I handed him the sign
Oh, friends of mine",Friends of Mine
Adam Green,"Frozin in time forever
Carrying that torch for so long
Can you hear my heart believing
Frozen in the index of time

They singled out my tongue
In front of everyone
Who was watching my show
They say that I'm no good

I'm sorry that I could
Be that way to you
Dusting off the roman dollar
Searching for some work on the side

I'm just closer to death then ever
Frozen in the index of time
They just don't have the minds
To pay me for my crimes

That they made me do
They don't care how it feels
To them this isn't real
In my magical womb

Frozin in time forever
Carrying that torch for so long
Can you hear my heart believing
Frozen in the index of time

Baby",Frozen in Time
Adam Green,"Hard to be a girl. 
So nice to be a boy. 
In my room at night. 
Not a pretty site. 
Here's an empty kiss marching to the rhythm of the pay roll. 
I can be a good boy too, 
Just let me out of the stable. 

Sausages and eggs, 
And hot and sour soup. 
Thank me for your time, 
'Cause I can be as bad as you. 
Hard to be a girl. 
That's what the oracle told me, 
I don't care what she says, 
I assume its best to be lonely.",Hard to Be a Girl
Adam Green,"I want to chose to die,
And be buried with a rubix cube
And sleep inside the big blue buildings,
While the sweet disease drives through

There's a bakery in the night sky
I want to die because the government lied

She was a man with herpes,
Floating in a yellow stream
Running through the windows backwards
Kissing all the buildings clean

You know his appetite for hardcore taste
And orgyastic party games

She woke up in the highway,
With arrows pointing at her face
Later that day in gym class,
She ate a mouth full of anthrax,
Go to sleep",I Wanna Die
Adam Green,"Musical ladders
Leaning on mountains
Bathed in white laughter
Under the sun

Somebody's birthday
Came stumbling towards us
Wrapped in green gladness
Under the sun

We're gonna to make it through this war tonight
Someone hold this child up to the light

Prostitute fingers
Fumbling with matches
Tucked in red couches
Under green moons

Mexican waitress
Got caught in the crossfire
Of militant families
Bursting with jews

We're gonna break it to your folks tonight
Kind of hope your pops don't hear me right
Ooh yeah",Musical Ladders
Adam Green,"There's no wrong way to f*** a girl with no legs
Just tell her you love her as she's crawlin' away
There's no wrong way to f*** a bitch with no faith
Now you'll never be sad again

Lovin' you are the two best things in a world that's skipping town
Reaching blind into the deepest mouth in the brownest place around

There's something I miss in her cum stained lips
So I get the first kiss before she takes the last bite
Genital outlaws in a positive way, and in everything bagel too

Getting strangeld by the junkie priest as the boys get stoned in school
There's a knock at the door and your parents come in
They thought you were a different girl

So if you're alone when you're parents aren't home
And no one can see your incestuous tree
No need to contain what the sparrows can say
Now you'll never be sad again",No Legs
Adam Green,"If there's a heart inside your eye 
If there's a clock inside your head 
If there's a girl outside your bed 
Put your face in my place 

My head is falling off my head 
And I don't want to see clear again 
Everyone is talking about Jesus
Everyone is talking about Jesus
Everyone is talking about Jesus 
Everyone's fucking my princess 

Goodnight to my new dead wife 
Goodnight to my Nazi friend 
I'm standing on the tip of my stinking ship 

Hey princess over there 
Why you sitting over there 
When you've got a warm spot to share 
In the prince's bed 
In the prince's bed 
In the prince's bed 
In the prince's bed 
In the prince's bed 

Oh I know you've thought about it 
And I knew you want to have it 
Now I always have my camera 
In the prince's bed 
In the prince's bed 
In the prince's bed 
In the prince's bed",The Prince's Bed
Adam Green,"In the front of the line
Now I'm back at home
I want to live my life
In a bathtub

Roll a dirty dice
And you're playin' blood
Stole a maxipad
Because I abandoned love

It reminds me of salty candy
Semen shanties
Sailboats grindin'
Up against your back

I don't need no sentimental
Penis stencil
Feelings rising
Opposites attract

She made me feel so small
I had no say at all
She looked so cute they say
But I don't know her that way

Heaven hold me back
Got 20 lives
Got my jesus jammies
Need some exercise

Take a walk at night
Past the dating bar
I want to live my life
Like a trackstar

Na, na na na na na  Na, na na na na na
Na, na na na na na  Na, na na na na na
Na, na na na na na  Na, na na na na na
Na, na na na na na  Na, na na na na na",Salty Candy
Adam Green,"There are men in shades, just standing around
These bleeding stars, the paradox
Let the eyes of god be our guide to find a gentle path

There's a broken record playing a tune
To the floating waves of the antennas
And you were just a little guy, and I was little too

And everything is just floating freely
Just rocking around like a rocking horse
Just jiggling around like silly putty
And who are you and I

And you were looking at me smiling
The aliens were just arriving
Wherever they are headed next
Speaking secret tongues",Secret Tongues
Adam Green,"Picture a place that's far from danger.
A nicer place to cash your chips.
I'm not the one holding you hostage.
Squeezed in between my lips.

We're not supposed to be lovers.
Or friends, like they'd have us believe.
We're not supposed to know each other.
Accept my apology.

I was a babe stuck in a tree branch.
Banging on my rusty cradle bars.
Until I stole your middle finger.
Now who's the one in charge?

We're not supposed to be lovers.
Or friends, like they'd have us believe.
We're not supposed to know each other.
Accept my apology.

Vain, underground, fist, face down.
Bruise as they heal my pain.
Food on the flight.
Bread, fist, bite.
Draw from the orange juice crane.

Picture a person you've forgotten.
Kissing your brother or your friend.
Picture a wounded entertainer.
Cutting his hair again.",We're Not Supposed to Be Lovers
Adam Green,"Hey
Things won't be strange any day now
They change every day

Hey 
Things won't be bad all the time now
Stay bad all the time

But hey now, little lady 
This is a tragical sign
It's a sign

Morning after midnight
Things don't ever go right
Morning after midnight
Hey bye bye
Not so sad to wake up
But I took the bait up
Morning after midnight
What's going on yeah

Hey, what's that sound
Might get a glimpse of just what's going down
Oh modern lover what's that noise
Ah it's just you, Johnny, not one of your boys
We say hey

Hey
Things won't be strange any day now

Hey 
Things won't be bad all the time now
Stay bad all the time

But hey now, little lady 
This is a tragical sign
It's a sign, it's a sign, it's a sign

Morning after midnight
Things don't ever go right

Hey bye bye
Not so sad to wake up
But I took the bait up
Morning after midnight
Hey cha cha cha",Morning After Midnight
Adam Green,"Who cares what day it is
Or how long we live for?
I need to make a judgment
About you before my bedtime 
For when I put my head down on the pillow
My drugstore dreams will cut me down to size
By then I'll be a brand new different person
To love you while I'm trying to decide 

I don't care what time you keep
Or what you thought I came to do
I lost you on a Tuesday
That's all I can remember 

For when I put my head down on the pillow
My drugstore dreams will cut me down to size
By then I'll be a brand new different person
To love you while I'm trying to decide 

Oh, the spectrum of my days
The make-up that was peeling off
Your adolescent face
Oh, such a face
To try to get the clocks to change
To turn and swing the other way
Before I knew that pigeons cried
And sanctified the hopelessness inside",Before My Bedtime
Adam Green,"She's my baby, she's my love
Pixie Queen of Bible Club
Seen her round the fountain sipping cokes
Crafting brand new Polish jokes
And I can't explain why my accent changed
I guess there's still some hope to score some dope
She needs to be changed inside 
She's my waitress, she's the boss
Lips and teeth of scented cloths
Pencil in the dentist, clean the crops
Have you seen my soda pop?
There was a Polish priest
Who thought that he could please me
He got me so whacked down, I nearly lost my house
'Cause nobody needs me, yeah",Bible Club
Adam Green,"Carolina, she's from Texas
Red bricks drop from her vagina
Oh, her lips taste just like sunk ships
But her breasts taste just like breakfast
There's her hand now on the cock sock
Filled with white tears from the thrift store
She's an eyesore in her red dress
I'm the ghost of her deceased when she said
 
Give us back our lives
Leave him, Carolina
Everything's just fine
Refill my prescription
Until next time
I get so lost inside the rooms inside my mind 

California presidente
Cogi mucho estoy cansado
Dostoevsky, Fab Moretti
Antiseptic, complimentary
There's her hand now on the cock sock
Filled with white tears from the thrift store
She's an eyesore in her red dress
I'm the ghost of her deceased when she said 

Give us back our lives
Leave him, Carolina
Everything's just fine
Refill my prescription
Until next time
I get so lost inside the rooms inside my mind 

Goodnight, sweetheart
Flying high on birth control
She knows the pregnancy will show
That she smells nice when you look twice
Who's your boyfriend, Carolina?
And it's goodnight, sweetheart
Flying high on birth control
She knows rejections in her bones 

Carolina, she's from Texas
Red bricks drop from her vagina
Carolina

Adam Green,"I did not ask for a lot this year
Every single day
Looking for an answer to the words you say
Never got to meet the President

Never got to shake his squirly hand
Oh, don't you know the President
Is out for tea with Tony Blair
He won't be back for hours maybe, homeboy 

I'd be so happy if I got to meet George Bush
He's like an angel when Rebecca hears me calling
I would dance on NBC and say
'George Bush shook hands with me'
Then I'd go and choke on a cock 

And Guinevere would find me leaving home
And Johnny Depp would call me on the phone
And Johnny Depp would call me on the phone, I know
I'd be the greatest singer on the radio 

Leaning on the raging river flats
Sliding off a single blade of grass
Oh, don't you know the A.D.A.
Is brushing teeth with Johnny J
They won't be smashing flowers, meet me no more 

I'd be so happy if I bid it all on you
And never answer when Rebecca asks me questions
I'd lay down to some degree
And say John Stern locked lips with me

And then I'd go and choke
For then I'd go and choke
For then I'd go and choke on a cock",Choke on a Cock
Adam Green,"The sweat on your lips is the rest of your smack
Your breath starts to skip as your neck turns to slack
Lay down my chubby princess before you get some rest
'Cause tonight she's gonna put your crummy mattress to the test 
And they say not so many strawberries grow in the sea
'Cause it's too late for changes in my family
And all the phoney princes still hate my guts so much
'Cause I just don't believe in bad news before lunch 

And if I went back to that whorehouse tonight
Do you think I'd find a reason for a princess not to bite 

For those of us folks that good health does not bless
The best news for us is the end of our death
Lay down my chubby princess before you get some rest
'Cause tonight she's gonna put your crummy mattress to the test 

And if I went back to that whorehouse tonight
Do you think I'd find a reason for a princess not to bite
My cock",Chubby Princess
Adam Green,"Back in the summer of '91
An angel with a lizard's tongue
Was scheming for a holy broken nose
Linked to every class of men
Sprung out from the sparkling sins
Leaning on the cold electric stove 
On a country road I swerved to the side
Trying to avoid a country bumpkin
Everyone's in line to meet with the man
Who blatantly inspired his generation 

When they shake his hand and their fingers explode
Breaking both our necks by the tips of our toes
Then they turn to me, cause you died I suppose
But I can't seem to glance fast enough to be sure 

Back to summer days, cold hands on the beach
Memories of thrills designed to please you
Down the fragrant path I strayed towards the bath
Suddenly I lived to learn to feed you 

Down on bended knee, where I've been for a while
Set the record straight in the old fashioned style
Never took too much, though I should have made more
You are still my friend, though you were not before",Country Road
Adam Green,"Johnny please don't tell the people bout the bluebirds flight
Wasting education on a Tuesday night
Yes, you are my pussy, you're just being mean
Covering up the muscle in your Jordash jeans 
Stick up the phone, who is it?
Someone has come to visit
Everybody do the hokey pokey, do the crackhouse blues! 

Do the mashed potato till your feet glow green
Got to sweep the floor to keep the crackhouse clean
Took me to the movies, but the doctor said
Leave him to get beaten by the black eyed meds 

Stick up the phone, who is it?
Someone has come to visit
Everybody do the hokey pokey, do the crackhouse blues! 

Now the captain ran for cover when the steamboats crashed
Driving off the bridges cause they got no class
Barbara's got my number, now I've got to run
Pizzas to deliver in the crackhouse slum, you know

Sometimes when the night gets hot
I search around for the crack I lost
I wouldn't expect for you to notice me
I would not expect you to say 'Johnny!' 

Do the mashed potato till your feet glow green
Got to sweep the floor to keep the crackhouse clean
Took me to the movies, but the doctor said
Leave him to get beaten by the black eyed meds 

Stick up the phone like we do
Someone has come to see you
Everybody do the hokey pokey, do the crackhouse blues!",Crackhouse Blues
Adam Green,"Down on the street there's a police attack
And you've got to find out
So you suck on a cranberry candy 
They look so sad when you call 911
But you've got to report them for
Criminal classification 

What can I do? White light turns into blue
You know it's easy, so very easy
I'm in trouble like a dirty stinking jew 

Pepe Le Pew singing 'What can I do?'
Still I go on vacations
And act like the queen of injustice 

And the girl on the subway who sleeps on her back
And she's got to relax
When I speak of the pleasures of silence 

I want to play, who threw my toys away
And gave me coffee, who wants some coffee?
I'm in business on the wrong side of your bay 

My heart be still, white light deploy at will
My little brother, I want another
Come together now for one enchanting thrill",Down on the Street
Adam Green,"I just don't care about the evening news,
I never listen to the crack house blues,
They say the city is a place to be,
I want to dance with Emily

Everybody come around the window shop,
I guess they've never seen the moves I got,
I want to be with what the people see,
I want to dance with Emily

Emily, sweet baby, won't you be my wife?
Cutting me wide open with a kitchen knife,
Everybody said that she's under age,
Honky tried to shoot her with a seven gauge
Now I got the cookies that your momma sent,
I got permission from the government,
Someone should mention to the minister:
Now I gotta dance with Jennifer

Jenny's got a mouth so full of pidgeon's cum,
On top a mountain made a bubblegum,
Don't understand what all the grief is for,
Now I gotta dance with Eleanor

Eleanor, I wonder if we go too slow,
Straight down the hatch beneath the streetlights' glow,
Baby, when I get you on a persian rug,
That's the kind of movies I've been dreaming of
Ow ow

I tell you something that you think I'd know,
I got two tickets to the sold out show,
Some of the fellas like to think I'm Greek,
I want to love you maybe three days a week,
Oh

I just don't care about the evening news,
I never listen to the crackhouse blues,
I want to be with what the people see,
I want to dance with Emily

I want to dance with Emily",Emily
Adam Green,"Gemstones cracking, cause we're just too strong
Drum-sized yearning 'cause the pressure's gone
Supervised love, crucified stuvs
Simmering red in the sex farm clubs 
There's an exit to this desert
Dangling freely from the shingles in the snow
She's a show off, Xanax Zoloft
Blank faced footprints of the zebras in the glen 

Cavemen humping in the sterling space pod
Drumstick pumpkin in the Starbucks courtyard
Gigolos dance, stepping on toes
Benedryl nights in the okay holes 

There's an exit to this desert
Dangling freely from the shingles in the snow
She's a show off, Xanax Zoloft
Blank faced footprints of the zebras in the glen 

Let's break into the labyrinth of lies
Let's dive off the end of his eyes
Hollywood hills, peppermint pills
I can still taste the grime that you stuffed in my gills 

Oh Johnny, can't you set a place for Holly?
She's a wild one, she'll be staying for a spell
Till they find her, then they drag her down
To Barcelona! Down to Barcelona!
I'm a very funny boy, but I know not to say 'cha cha cha'
Dunkin' Donuts, give me Dunkin' Donuts!
She's a very funny girl
But I love that crazy bitch, alright!",Gemstones
Adam Green,"He's the brat with the sterilized pitchfork
He's the singer of the Beachwood Sparks
He's a dreamy kind of cheesy companion piece
Who wants to show me where the healing starts 
Beauty is evil
Immaculate evil, don't you think?
But I'm lost in the flames of a grand explosion
Stumbling in the neon groves 

Ladies flock to the overnight discos
Slamming vodka tonic down their throats
While your older brothers company publicist
Is sliding off his momma's pantyhose 

Beauty is evil
Immaculate evil, don't you think?
But I'm mopping up stains from a blood transfusion
Stumbling in the neon groves 

Oh the pleasures of the morning are simple
But the treasures are the sweetest I've known
Oh I'm just so excited to look through my new eyes
The needles are covered with snow 

So take me down to the winter land bombshell factory
You can hear the mermaids groan
On the double breasted coconut seashell
Half wrecked bus to Yankee Stadium 

Beauty is evil
I like to be evil, can't you see?
But I'm lost in the flames of a grand explosion
Stumbling in the neon groves",He's the Brat
Adam Green,"Losing on a Tuesday filled with purposeful disasters
Tell her I'm losing on a Tuesday afternoon
Anger steers me clear of every instinct for eloping
Someone should mention that I won't see you again 
Tuesday's the day I die
Moping in style but still so lost
Caught in between the uptown scenes
Destined to fall apart tonight
I don't mind the crazy weather
I'm so glad we stayed together 

I'm just losing on a Tuesday filled with purposeful disasters
Tell her I'm losing on a Tuesday afternoon",Losing on a Tuesday

Never gonna see the end of you this way
Until I see the magical fungi
Now there she goes right over the sunrise

Never gonna be adored
Never gonna be bout you, momma! 
Now there she goes, right over the sunrise
'Cause I'm so sick of fuckin' up in the subway

We're gonna do it in this beautiful mustang
'Cause I'm a choo choo, we're pumping and revelling 

Cinnamon the spider bones
I'm talking on the telephone
And sending off the message to the wingman
Later in the afternoon 

I almost stole a different tune 
I waited till the evening came to write this song
Walked into a coffee shop
In time to grab a soda pop

Before the dog exploded on the curbside
Yesterday my hair was gray 
I turned and faced the other way
Back behind the mirror where the kids play 
Momma! 

Now there she goes, right over the sunrise

Adam Green,"I'm a man in the rain
Here they come now, Teddy Boys
I'm a bad man all alone
I belong here, Teddy Boys 
Oh, maybe I'm just looking for something nasty
Songs I'm gonna sing in jail
Or maybe I'm just looking for some affectations
Before the bouncer comes and kicks me out of the club 

I'm a man, maybe two
And I see you, Teddy Boys
Like a mad dog in a dream
I want ice cream, Teddy Boys 

Oh maybe I'm just looking for something nasty

Oh Bobby's not in trouble, maybe it's his birthday
And now somebody's come to kick me out of the club

Adam Green,"Who's your boyfriend on this coast?
I bet your boyfriend hates you most
I joke around but I don't look down
Because you could break my heart
Only you could break my heart
Only you could win my dreams back
From the man who writes prescriptions on post-it notes 
I bet your boyfriend hates you most
I joke around but I don't look down
Because you could break my heart
Only you could break my heart
Only you could win my dreams back from your girlfriend

She will become someone I listen for nothing more
Into the hallway with you",Who's Your Boyfriend
Adam Green,"Animal dreams, animal dreams
Dreaming a long pelican sleep
She closes her eyes
I'm sorry I got so tired
But I think I'd better wake up before the day transpires

Oh animal, animal, magical
The message has come from across the Bolivian seas
Side down, two blocks down
All in (?) jump out of the ground

Five times four, two blocks more
Count by eight now lower the game
I think it's the time for us
I think it's the place for us

Oh lady don't know I built it to last
Oh wait til she sees me
Changing the past 
I cram it all in
No need to subtract by five
I wish I never gave up before the day transpires

A sleepy dream memory of our first kiss

Cast a shadow in my direction

Bring back shadows of your affection
Cast a shadow in my direction yeah

If the sandman comes tonight I have a request
A snap-shot dreamy keepsake of your embrace

Cast a shadow in my direction
Cast a shadow in my direction
Bring back shadows of your affection
Cast a shadow in my direction

Bring back shadows over here
Bring back shadows of your face

It ain't cool to sing love songs
But I'm singing one to you
It ain't cool to sing love songs
But I'm giving one to you
And if you laugh at me
That's how it's going to be
'Cause I'm doing it
Yes it's true
Ah, 'cause now that I've got it
I get it now

The way folks go on and on about it
They're gonna wear the word out
And every time you see a poor fool fall in it
That's all he talks about
I enver understood why the subject of love
Was the biggest thing around
Ah, but now that I've got it
I get it now

Love is cool 
Love is cool baby
And oh yeah, what's a poor boy
What's a poor boy to do, yeah",It Ain't Cool
Adam Gregory,"Down in Dallas lord those girls are fine
in Carolina they make you lose your
mind sometimes
But it don't matter, it's wasted on me
'Cause everywhere I go you're the

No more rooms at all, this heart is taken, yeah

Adam Gregory,"How do you explain the way the stars just
Hang way up in the sky
How do you explain the way rain goes away
Whenever you walk by

It's a mystery just how life can lead
To a place you've never been
You've knocked on that door
A hundred times before, when it
Suddenly let you in

I don't know why 
I've been so blessed to love someone like you
I don't know why
I must confess, I only know I do

And how do you explain the way
My world has changed right before my eyes
And how do you explain the way you 
Gave me wings
When I swore I could never fly

It's a mystery what you've done for me
I'm at a place I've never been
I've knocked on that door
A hundred times before
Now you've suddenly let me in

In my heart, I won't question
I'll just lay here in your arms",Only Know I Do
Adam Gregory,"She stares at that ring on her finger
With a far away look in her eyes
She thinks of the memories that linger
Of the good days that quickly flew by

And she remembers the day
When a young man would say
That he'd found the love of his life
She gave him her hand and he placed on a band
And asked her if she'd be his wife

And some may value its silver
And some may value its gold
But she knows no greater value
Than the memories it holds

She added a stone when the children were born
And her husband now looks down from above
She's lived a good life as a mother and wife
And the ring is a symbol of love

And her friends know when to leave her alone
They can tell she needs time to cry
She stares at that ring on her finger
With a far away look in her eyes",The Ring
Adam Gregory,"I sat on the couch, with a book in my hand
I thought of all the good times that I've had
But even though life's sometimes hard
And it's hard to understand
The sky is the limit, so do with it what you can

Oh, the sky's the limit the sky never ends
Even though life's a struggle, one day it will end
So make the best of what you have
Be it good or be it bad
And oh, the sky is the limit
So do with it what you can

I wake up every morning
With a smile upon my face
The day seems so exciting
I could never complain
My family is so supportive
They're the best that a boy could have
So take each day for what it's worth
And then you'll understand why...",The Sky Is the Limit
Adam Gregory,"My best friend called me, He said I'm going to a party, He asked me If I wanna come along, well I'm on

Put on my worn out blue jeans, they gotta hole in the left knee, but they've never ever done wrong, so long

I'm hoping when I get there that I'll meet the one who'd make the Earth start shaking and pound it like a drum

Chourus
Giddy up Get ready let's get it on
And we'll be one step, two step, three step dancing, then we'll party all night long, and we'll be going strong (hoo hoo hoo) we'll set the night on fire until the break of dawn,

From the moment that I saw her, my eyes kept looking over, to me she looked just like a cherry pie. my my.
She said welcome to the party, I said girl you talking to me, could it be its my lucky night, that's right. 
Then with just one kiss I knew that she would be the one who'd make the Earth start shaking and pound it like a drum.

Trust in me and I will never let you down

Trust your soul when there's nobody else around

Trust in love cause it will always heal your heartbreaks

And we always learn em better from our mistakes

For me there'll never be nobody else but you


I thought of walking by myself

But I could never make it through - without you


There's nothing we can't over come

Were staring at a bright new sun

Well take it day by day and stay one breathe from a heartache

Well touch the earth and kiss the sky

As the same moment passes by

Then well be sure to stay one breathe away from heartache

One breathe from the heartache


Touch my hand if I ever feel that you're weak


Lay your head here on my shoulder when you need

Tell your secrets to me when they get too heavy

And Ill make sure that I'm always there for you

I don't need anybody else but you - for me

I don't know if Ill find the words

But if I do will you believe


There's nothing we can't over come

Were staring at a bright new sun

And well take it day by day and stay one breathe from a heartache

Well touch the earth and kiss the sky

As the same moment passes by

Then well be sure to stay one breathe from a heartache


And I will catch you if you fall

My heart will be there if you call

And I will cover you through anything at all


One breathe from a heartache

there's nothing we can't over come

Were staring at a bright new sun

Well take it day by day and stay one breathe from a heartache

One breathe from a heart ache

Trust in me and I will never let you down

With a smile on his face

Though I was just a kid I'd always remember what he did 
When raindrops fell His words would fill my mind again

Back to your smiling eyes

Those faded cut off jeans are my favorite pair
Don't go messing with your hair
Let it all blow around

Move over in the middle by me
Just like you did
When your daddy couldn't see
Why his little girl loved a boy like me

Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

When I was so broken hearted
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
'Cause me and them ways have parted
That kind of love was the killin' kind
Now listen
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' cause I let you
Do what you do - down on me

Now there's not even breathin' room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah you cry when we're makin' love
Must be one and the same

It's down on me
Yeah I got to tell you one thing
It's been on my mind
Girl I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You got that certain something
What you give to me
Takes my breath away
Now the word out on the street
Is the devil's in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
It's a fire I can't resist

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' cause I let you
Do what you do to me

'Cause what you got inside
Ain't where your love should stay
Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love
If you give your heart away

Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dyin' are the best I ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very, very

Children waitin' for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher, tell me what's my lesson?
Look right through me, look right through me

Will it make it easier on you now?
You got someone to blame

You say one love, one life
It's one need in the night
One love, you get to share it
It'll leave you baby if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
You want me to go without

Well, it's too late tonight to drag the past out into the light
We're one but we're not the same
We gotta carry each other, carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much, more than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now it's all that I got
We're one but we're not the same
We hurt each other then we do it again

You say love is a temple, love is a higher law
Love is a temple, love is the higher law
You ask me to enter then you make me crawl
And I can't keep on holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you gotta do what you should
One life with each other, my sisters and my brothers

One life but we're not the same
Gotta carry each other, carry each other
One, one, one, one

I never had no problems burnin' down one night stands
And everythin' around me got to stop to feelin' so low

And movin' to the groovin'

Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die, till you die

I tried to understand this
I thought that they were out of their minds
How could I be so foolish?
How could I to not see they were the one behind?

So still I kept on fightin'
Losing every step of the way
I said I must go back there, yes I will
And check to see if things still the same

Adam Lambert,"So it would appear 
I left my heart here 
And it would be fair to say 
I've been swept away 
So move in right along 
For you I wrote this song 
If I'm a fool 
So this fool will never be with you 
Oh yeah I know 

For just when I thought that we could make it 
Realty strikes me down 

For I don't want tomorrow 
Just give me some today 
I'll be on first train back home to yesterday 
Yesterday 
To yesterday 

Leave me on the hell 
For fifty years 
Dancing there 
Leave me where you will 
I'm very well 

You are

You are the star 
Yes you are 
Yes you are

Adam Lambert,"Have you lost your way?
Livin' in the shadow of the messes that you made
And so it goes
Everything inside your circle starts to overflow

Take a step before you leap
Into the colors that you seek
You give back what you give away
So don't look back on yesterday

Wanna scream out, no more hiding
Don't be afraid of what's inside
Gonna tell ya you'll be alright
In the aftermath

Anytime anybody pulls you down
Anytime anybody says you're not allowed
Just remember you are not alone
In the aftermath

You feel the weight
Of lies and contradictions that you live with every day
It's not too late
Think of what could be if you rewrite the role you play

Take a step before you leap
Into the colors that you seek
You give back what you give away
So don't look back on yesterday

Wanna scream out, no more hiding
Don't be afraid of what's inside
Gonna tell ya you'll be alright
In the aftermath

Anytime anybody pulls you down
Anytime anybody says you're not allowed
Just remember you are not alone
In the aftermath
In the aftermath

Before you break you have to change your own mind
Take a trip and fall into the pit
Tell a stranger that they're beautiful

So all you feel is love, love
All you feel is love, love

Wanna scream out, no more hiding
Don't be afraid of what's inside
Wanna tell you you'll be alright
In the aftermath

Wanna scream out
No more hiding
Don't be afraid of what's inside
Gonna tell ya you'll be alright

Anytime anybody says you're not allowed

Adam Lambert,"All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Goin' no where, goin' no where

And their tears are fillin' up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dyin' are the best I ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very, very
Mad world, mad world

Children waitin' for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher, tell me what's my lesson?
Look right through me, look right through me

And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dyin' are the best I've ever had

Yeah, that really hits the spot
I’m feeling pretty fierce in my dancin’ shoes

No, I ain’t broken, but I need a fix
That satisfaction when I get my kicks
I’m up all night, I’m outta sight
Don’t turn on the light
'Cause I’m feeling so shady lately
Come on and take me underground
Deep under the street
Come on and take me, take me down
Where freaks like us can meet

Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it way up, don’t stop the beat
Come on and turn me, turn me out

I throw more shade than a cloudy day
The brakes don’t work, I’m just a runaway train
Somebody come and help me out,
All I wanna be is free

Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark

I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light

Diana, I need you more and more

Just thinking of you, Just thinking of you 
And living without your love is the hardest thing

And the loneliness is my empty nights 
While I'm missing you

There's an empty space in my heart

Baby, tell me what's on your mind.

I don't care what people say
About the two of us from different worlds.
I love you so much that it hurts inside,
Are you listening?

Listen to me, girl.

Can't we try just a little bit harder?
Can't we give just a little bit more?
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fighting for?
Can't we try just a little more passion?
Can't we try just a little less pride?
Love you so much baby,
That it tears me up inside.

I hear you on the telephone with God knows who,
Spilling out your heart for free.
Everyone needs someone they can talk to,
Girl, that someone should be me.

So many times, I tried to tell you,
You just turned away.

How did I know?

My life is changing so fast now,
Leaves me lonely and afraid.

Just talking to the rain
You said I've been driving you crazy
And it's keeping you away

So just give me one good reason
Tell me, why I should stay?
'Cause I don't wanna waste another moment
Saying things we were never meant to say

And I, take it just a little bit
I, hold my breath and count to ten
I've been waiting for a chance to let you in

If I just breathe, how do you fill the space in between?
Oh, no, everything is alright
Breathe, everything little piece of me
You'll see everything is alright
If I just breathe

Well, it's ours, so overrated
Not saying how you feel
So you end up watching chances fade
And wonder in which way?

And I, give you just a little time
I, wonder if you realize?
I've been waiting till I see it in your eyes

If I just breathe, how do you fill the space in between?
Oh, no, everything is alright

The universe seen through your eyes
The moon is a glorious halo
Hanging high over your head every night
Spinning and spinning
A flick of the wrist and a smile
And in the morning so early
Deep conversations are spoken
In tongues by sunlight

Tonight, you can dream you're a star 
You can walk on the clouds 
And float to the ground 
And I'm with you 

We stare out the window 
And look to the sky every night 
The stars are the beacons of heaven 
And maybe one day you'll go up for a ride 
Oh, you are the sunshine 
You are the face that I dream of 
You are your mother's religion 
Down on her knees as she 
Kisses your heartache away 

Tonight, you can dream you're a star 
You can walk on the clouds 
And float to the ground 
And I'm with you 
Tonight, you can get very far 
The calm and the storm 
Are forever yours 
And I'm with you

I've been to the mountain 
I've lived through the violence 
I've seen what man can do to man 
I can't promise you peace 
I can't promise you money 
But I promise to make you the best man I can

Then maybe when you smiled
I never would have felt so weak 

If maybe we'd never hugged before 
If one kiss had just once been then been no more 
If this bond had never climbed to the foreground

""The Lunchlady"" 
[Laughing] 

Woke up in the morning 
Put on my new plastic glove 
Served some reheated salisbury steak 
With a little slice of love 
Got no clue what the chicken pot pie is made of 
Just know everything's doing fine 
Down here in Lunchlady Land 

Well I wear this net on my head 
'Cause my red hair is fallin' out 
I wear these brown orthopedic shoes 
'Cause I got a bad case of the gout 
I know you want seconds on the corndogs 
But there's no reason to shout 
Everybody gets enough food 
Down here in Lunchlady Land 

Well yesterday's meatloaf is today's sloppy joes 
And my breath reeks of tuna 
And there's lots of black hairs coming out of my nose 
In Lunchlady Land your dreams come true 
Clouds made of carrots and peas 
Mountains built of shepherds pie 
And rivers made of macaroni and cheese 
But don't forget to return your trays 
And try to ignore my gum disease 
No student can escape the magic of Lunchlady Land 

Hoagies & grinders, hoagies & grinders 
Hoagies & grinders, hoagies & grinders 
Navy beans, navy beans, navy beans 
Hoagies & grinders, hoagies & grinders 
Navy beans, navy beans 
Meatloaf sandwich 
Sloppy joe, slop, sloppy joe 
Sloppy joe, slop, sloppy joe 
Sloppy joe, slop, sloppy joe 
Sloppy joe, slop, sloppy joe 

Well I dreamt one morning 
That I woke up to see 
All the pepperoni pizza 
Was a-looking at me 
It screamed, why do you burn me 
And serve me up cold 
I said I got the spatula 
Just do what you're told 
Then the liver & onions 
Started joining the fight 
And the chocolate pudding 
Pushed me with all its might 
And the chop suey slapped me 
And it kicked me in the head 
It's called revenge Lunchlady 
Said the garlic bread 
I said what did I do 
To make you all so mad 
They said you got flabby arms 
And your breath is bad 
Then the green beans said 
You better run and hide 
But then my friend sloppy joe came 
And joined my side 
He said if it wasn't for the Lunchlady 
The kids wouldn't eatcha 
You should be shakin' her hand 
And sayin' please to meet ya 
She gives you a purpose 
And she gives you a goal 
You should be kissin' her feet 
And kissin' her mole 
Now all the angry foods 
Just leave me alone 
And we all live together 
In a happy home 

Thanks to 
Sloppy joe, slop, sloppy joe 
Sloppy joe, slop, sloppy joe 
Sloppy joe, slop, sloppy joe 
Sloppy joe, slop, sloppy joe

Well me & sloppy joe got married 
We got six kids and we're doing' just fine

Adam Sandler,"When I'm feeling down 
And feeling sad 
You come around 
And make me glad 
I got you 
Oh, my little chicken 

I love your feet 
I love your breasts 
I love the way you eat gravel 
To help you digest 
Oh, my little chicken 

People say you're using me 
In your heart you're a killer 
But I know the worst 
I should fear is 
A slight case of salmonella 
So lie right back 
Don't you cry 
If an egg can fit in there 
Why can't I.....mmmmmmm 
Oh my little

Piece of shit car
I got a piece of shit car
That fuckin' pile of shit
Never gets me very far

My car's a big piece of shit
'Cause the shocks are fucking shot
And my seatbelt's fucking broken
I got to tie it in a knot
(It's a piece of shit)

I can't see through the windshield
'Cause it's got a big fucking' crack
And the interior smells real bad
'Cause my friend puked in the back
(It's a piece of shit)

(Piece of shit car)

(He's got a piece of shit car)
It sucks royal dick

(That fuckin' pile of shit)
100% crap
(Never gets him very far)
Oh fuck you car

It's got no CD player, it only got the 8-track
Whoever designed my car can lick my sweaty nut sack
(They can bite his ass too)
And I got no fuckin' brakes

I'm always way out of control
Eleven times a day I hear ""Hey, watch it asshole""
(You fuckin' piece of shit)

(Piece of shit car)
I got piece of shit car

Diesel gas sucks my ass

(That fuckin' pile of shit)
That pile of metal shit
(Never gets him very far)

Oh what the fuck did I do
What the fuck did I do
What the fuck did I do
To get stuck with you

You're too wide for drive-through
And you smell like the shoe
But I'm too broke to buy something new
Oh fuck me

Well the engine likes to flood
The car always fuckin' stalls
And the seat cushion's got a big rip
So a spring always pokes the balls

(Ouch, ouch, ouch)
Plus the door locks are busted
I gotta use a fucking coat hanger
(What a pain in his ass)

And if a girlie sees my car
There's no chance I'll ever bang her
(He never ever gets da pussy)
Hey shut up
(Piece of shit car)
You piece of shit car

(You got a piece of shit car)
You piece of shit car
(Piece of shit car)
Bald fuckin' tires

(You got a piece of shit car)
No rearview fucking mirror
(Piece of shit car)
Seven different colors

(You got a piece of shit car)
Fucking rag for a gas cap
(Piece of shit car)
Tailpipe makes the sparks fly everywhere

(You got a piece of shit car)
(Piece of shit car)

Oh the whole town thinks I'm a loser

Best friend of mine, we're closer than close
Something very rare to find, we're opposite sexes
We can talk about anything, that's why I love you
And it's hard to try to hide what I'm confessing
That I can't help it, I'm so into you
You send me to the sky
Keep me breathless, oh I'm wanting you
And I can't deny it
I want to be more than this

'Cause you give me reason
To fall in love again, but I'll leave it as it is now
For another day, for another day

Any time of the day, that's why I call her

Sometimes you're weak and then you're wild

You keep me guessin' all the time
You play the fool and then you shine
Can I meet you in between?
'cause you know we could both do without a scene, now
I don't mean to blame you
I got some work of my own to do

Ooh - We could tear it down and build it up again
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me, first of all, learnin'
And maybe then we can make amends
We could follow it through to the very end - it's true

You think you deserve another try

Well girl, I don't know what it is that you're expecting
Just because you look me in the eye

And say you're sorry
Sorry
You want it back the way it was
Well, I'm sorry
But sometimes sorry
Just ain't good enough

You say you never meant to hurt me
Honey, that might be true
Do you really think I should forgive you
For what you put me through?

Oh, I remember every time you said you loved me
But I know now your love was just a lie

And you say you're sorry
Sorry
You want it back the way it was
Well, I'm sorry
But sometimes sorry
Just ain't good enough

Adam Watts,"If I could turn this wasteland into gold
If could journey happily from young to old
I'd smash a thousand dreams I may have had
I'd give up all material things and I'd be glad
If I could only make one choice

I would choose you
I would choose you
I would choose you
I would choose you

If I could give the heartless a little soul
If I could set a spark beneath lovers gone cold
I'd tear at the seams with all I have
Surrender all my wants, my needs and I'd be glad
If I could only make one choice

I would choose you
I would choose you
I would choose you
I would choose you
I would choose you

I see the world take what I need
Use it all, lose the rest
To be a fool is to put it all
Above the one you know is love
I would not make that mistake

I would choose you
I would choose you
I would choose you
I would choose you

I would choose you
I would choose you
I would choose you
I would choose you

Adam Watts,"Trusting melted snow
When it's always changing
Is hard but you'll know why I'm here
Once I'm gone

What's burning below?
Miles of pain won't go, so I will
Shame on the child in me
Shame on the liar in me
It's a shame, it's a shame

You've made trust, to me seem a crime
Just know I've been with you honestly
The whole time

Is this love or are we
Looking for perfect things to claim?
Is this love or are we
Bleeding the blood of all the pain?
I guess this is love

The sun won't stay up for long
And you are so afraid
Afraid of the darkness that comes
So what can I do? You can't be alone tonight
So what can I do? I still love you

This is love sometimes
Forget all the perfect things we crave
This is love this time
What's living inside me, I can't tame
I guess, I guess this is love
This is love
",Still
Adam Watts,"I'm innocent, I'm guilty too
I wanna be, I wanna be with you
Got a hole inside but I wanna fill you up
Tell me did I leave you too long
Or could it be that I was never gone?

All in all you feel like home

I wanna be, I wanna be with you
I'm comin' home
I wanna be, I gotta be
I wanna be with you

Your innocence, it pierces through
A blurry mind and now I can see you
And though I fail sometimes, don't wanna do you wrong
It took a while but now I'm strong
It's you and me and it was all along

All in all you feel like home

I wanna be, I wanna be with you
I'm comin' home
I wanna be, I gotta be
I wanna be with you

You've seen me run
You've seen me blame
Please close your eyes
This time is not the same
We'll carry on, we'll carry on

All in all you feel like home

I wanna be, I wanna be with you
I'm comin' home
I wanna be, I gotta be
I wanna be with you
Wanna be with you

Seguro estas mejor
En tu luz más alla
Con tus alas de color
Negabas la eternidad
Y es ahora donde estas

Ho tú, invisible, sádico
Y ya joven para siempre
Dime ¿eres un sabio consciente
En tu disfraz angélico?

Seguro estas mejor
En tu luz más allá
Con tus alas de color
Negabas la eternidad
Y es ahora donde estas

¡Que pena!, ¡terminó!
Ya te olvido así es, así es
Lo sé, así es como lo digo
Pero miento ¡tengo fe!

Your crazy schemes,
They always let you down.
The things we chase,
A hopeless race,
You're breathless, off the ground.
From soaring highs to crash-and-dies,
A peace yet to be found.
But you could spend a lifetime running.
You could spend a lifetime running.

And do you feel the fire when the flame gets hot?
Are you living every day like it's the last you got?
Will you step aside when it all falls down,
And watch it burn away?
Have a little faith when the walls cave in,
Pray for strength to fly against the wind.
Will you walk away when the fire gets hot,
Or fight another
Another day, yeah.
Another day, yeah.

Your fractured heart,
Your disregard,
It leaves you frozen still.

A slow withdrawal
From it all
That keeps you unfulfilled.

Desolate places that I've been

It's me for you dear, and you for me
We'll fuss, we'll quarrel and tears start to brew

The thrill I get when you're by my side
And when we're older we'll proudly declare
Wasn't ours a lovely love affair

Adelaide Hall,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine

And miss it each night and day

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well

Adele,"Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say

I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue

But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you

And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you",Best for Last
Adele,"You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied

Adele,"Found myself today singing out your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you.

Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head.

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool.

Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you.

Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you.

My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood.

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into.

Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.

It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones

When night comes and you're all on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

[Chorus]

Go ahead and still (it's not steal) my heart
To make me cry again
Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
We were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game

Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones

But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest

Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there 'cause mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you never had met me) We could've had it all
We could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
It all, it all, it all, (you're gonna wish you never had met me)

Ticking by your call,
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees.

Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried,
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you.

So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper ""will you leave your man? ""
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
I won't stand by you.

Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you!

I ain't yours for no taking,
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong
And ignore the right

You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away

Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave

Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known

I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun

Adele,"I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together
Nothing is better

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear

Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Sometimes you walk alone, there's no one else around

Sometimes your soul is just a raging see

Has sworn me to secrecy

Away to the jackals

I saw you and moon

Alone and

To where the living are

Filled with hypnogogic shapes
And my body wracked with shakes
I traveled light years
In heart beats

I saw you and moon
Dancing together against dark blue
I saw you and moon
I never felt lonely 'til I saw you

Been making
Music
With instruments
Of science

Distracted
And happy
And so self
Reliant

And hope flooded through me
And I chased proof

But I left, I left too soon
'Cause light is a liar
And so are you

Than the truth
When I arrived
I found only tombs

'Cause light is a liar
Telling old truths
Having had something to aim for
Has left me lost

I put my trust into someone I don't know

Ja wie sollt' es anders sein Männer weinen nich'
Ich mein, sie leiden doch sie zeigen's nich', denn eigentlich
Denkt ein Mann, immer stark zu sein, ist seine Pflicht
Und wenn er weint, verliert er sein Gesicht, ist so
Egal, Männer haben's schwer doch nehmen's leicht
Solange noch ein bisschen Herz zum Überleben bleibt
Die Hülle lacht, doch die Seele weint
Also lieber Gott, steh' ihm bei

Auch wenn sie sagen, du bist nur der letzte Dreck
Ein echter Mann hört, nimmt es hin, steckt es weg
Und wenn er weint gibt's nur eine Antwort, ich glaube
Er hat einfach nur ein Sandkorn im Auge

Adestria,"These man made morals, like perfectly paved sidewalks,
force direction and safety, as they watch us like hawks.
They teach us to walk with blinders,
like the horses they wish we were,
to carry their causes on our backs
without questioning what they're for.
We simply nod and agree, we are bred to be lazy.
They set the world on fire, and we are the gasoline.
We're told to accept these give proofs.
We're fed a diet of lies and unproven truths.
I know that we've been herded together.
To be different leaves us alone.
They've put our minds to sleep, our dreams are not our own.
Like a thief, they came in the night,
to remove our will to fight.
We simply nod and agree, we are bred to be lazy.
They set the world on fire and we are the gasoline.
We're told to accept these given proofs.
We're fed a diet of lies and unproven truths.
They sit above, cast judgement down.
Offer no help to those that will surely drown.
They cast me out because I don't feel the same.
I'm not content seeing the world aflame.
And if to stand for something that's not a trend leads me to my end,
then I'll smile as I leave, because I fought for something that I believe.",1984

I can see that it's something you cannot hide.

There won't be a witness, as the moon hides her face.

As the night is disgraced and our innocence dies.
We get down to our most basic form, 
Never as pure as the day we were born.
We can't control this carnal need, 
To go numb to the world, embrace this ancient deed.
Eager rays of the sun wish to cleanse the earth of all we've done.
To speak of love would leave a bitter taste. 
To offer more than lust would be a waste.
There is beauty in using hands to see.
Why don't we hush our voices and speak with our hips? 
Keep at bay these anxious lips.

I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You've got a friend

Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend",You've Got a Friend

Things I never seen before,
You say you can fill my cup,
Screaming with just one touch,
Your name, all over this room baby ohhhhhh

Let's roll, I'll give you a chance to give it to me,
Ten inches deep, deep inside of me, make my body over flow,
Let's roll, you promised to do what you said,
The way I'm coming in my bed, slowly, harder, faster

I'm gonna slip my panties off,
I hope your man enough to get me off,
Victoria has no secrets tonight,
Just you and me sexing all night,
(I've never seen something so beautiful baby),
Give it to me, like you promised,
(dont hold back at all)

[Hook]
No more talking shit, make me slap my hips, man up,
Back to front, show me what's up, you know what I want yeah,
You like to cuddle up, now give me some, on my knees,
In between my cream, ten inches deep yeah

Of all these nigga tryna play like they thugs
I really can't sow them so love
I learn how to spot them from a mile away
And let me tell you how

Staying at home with your momma don't count
Borrowing a car to go out it don't count
Yea you got money in your pocket no doubt
But I found out you've been fakin the amount

So how...
How you get to the club?
Did you come on dubs?
And when you got inside did they show you some love? (no)

You was a passenger

It just ain't adding up (no no)
I think you missed your call and
You really shouldent be around these players
While they ballin
While your tryna to come up
You steady fallin
You need to find somethin else to put your all in

Its kinda crazy (its kinda crazy)
It goes back a little (It goes back a little)

We was like peanut butta and jelly (we was like, peanut butta n jelly)
It was crazy like (like)
One wasn't without the other (one wasn't without the other)
It was something (it was something)
And it took a wrong turn
I ended up on the freeway

I'm doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place
And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down
I'm doin 80 on the freeway and I'm on my way
I know that somethings wrong somethings wrong
I'm doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place
And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80

I got this feeling that I just can't shake
And I can't focus I can't even concentrate
Where my baby been all day long
Last time we spoke said he was on his way home
I tried to tell myself don't lose it don't jump to no conclusions
But what could he be doing
I'm headed for the door, grab my car keys
Now I'm on the freeway doin 80

I'm hoping that I'm wrong ain't nothings going on
I got this premonition womans intuition
If nothings going on won't you pick up the phone
And I gotta know so I gotta go

I'm doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place
And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down
I'm doin 80 on the freeway and I'm on my way
I know that somethings wrong somethings wrong
I'm doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place
And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80

As I get closer I start to question what I'm doing
I must be wrong could I be wrong am I just foolish
He gotta know I ain't the type of girl to fool with
And god I hope I don't run up and see some bullshit
I tried to tell myself don't lose it just turn up the music
But what could he be doing oh
Damn he got me dippin
Don't wanna get a ticket
But I gotta know

I'm hoping that I'm wrong ain't nothings going on
I got this premonition womans intuition
If nothings going on won't you pick up the phone
And I gotta know so I gotta go

I'm doin 80 on the freeway tryna get to your place
And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down
I'm doin 80 on the freeway and I'm on my way
I know that somethings wrong somethings wrong

And I ain't slowin down till I know what's goin down
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80
I'm doin 80 I I'm doin 80

I know he's home
His lights is on
Who's car is in the driveway
He ain't alone
I walked up on the porch
Knock knock knock (Who is it)
He won't open the door
Knock knock knock
Baby girl I know its you
But I can't open up this door
Cause if I do you'll know the truth and won't love me no more
Baby say no more open up the door
He opened the door
It was my best friend

I think it's time for a change

Have you not considered life beneath the thumb?
Or flying solo in your home?

(Admiral T)
Tu viens du ghetto mais reste fier,
Laissez-moi voir les mains en l'air
Te bats tous les jours pour t'en sortir,
Laissez-moi voir les mains en l'air
(Diam's)
C'est pour toutes les banlieues et pour toutes les provinces, OOH
Laissez-moi voir les mains en l'air
C'est pour les princesses et les princes, les grands curs et les pinces
Laissez-moi voir

(Admiral T)

Trop de jeunes blessés par balle finissent à l'hôpital
Trop de jeunes SDF, trop d'enfants qui mangent mal
Les politiques trouvent ça normal ils s'en foutent ça leur est égal
(Diam's) la précarité pré-domine et les frustrations s'installent
Diam's et Admiral sur le même instrumental,
Voir nos frères traîner, obligé que ça nous fasse mal
Nous sommes tous dans la même galère ghetto youth et banlieusards
Y'a pas de différence pour eux t'es un marginal

REFRAIN

(Admiral T)

Et de l'ambition, pas de résignation, gens des ghettos, des banlieues, gens de petite condition, boom
Evite la prison, l'argent sale et les « po po »
T'en sortir doit rester toujours ta principale mission

(Diam's)

Si tu viens du ghetto ghetto, tu tu viens de banlieue,
Tu connais le béton et le bédo et t'as peur que du bon Dieu,
C'est admirable si, po-po
T'es une petite banlieusarde et tu finis par kicker avec Admiral T
J'aime quand c'est rapide je fais ma thérapie de groupe
De Paris aux Antilles une tour ça reste une tour,
Une banlieue ça reste terne, un homme ça reste fier
Et merde mes frères, une femme ça reste une mère,
Donc je hausse la tête je viens de là où ça pète
Moi je viens de là où on rêve, là où on s'aime au lance-roquette,
Moi je suis fière, je veux décrocher le ciel,
Brille, brille, range ton cur de pierre et file, file

REFRAIN

(Admiral T)

Je me suis forgé dans mon ghetto, solide comme les métaux
N'acceptant pas la défaite sur elle j'ai mis un veto
Une confiance totale dans le plus haut, le micro
Comme arme plutôt que les 9 millimètres et les Magnums

(Diam's)

Ouais, ouais, les mecs sont forts dans ton ghetto, forgés déjà trop tôt,
Fans de K1, de Mani, de Fight et de Ze Pequeňo,
Il y a des femmes dans le ghetto, parfois c'est des bons potos
Elles veulent être des mini-miss qui rêvent d'être reines dans un château
Il y a de l'amour dans les blocs
Y'a du rap derrière les portes, po po
Il y a du ragga dans les caves dans les halls, po-po
Il y a du Admiral, y'a des jeunes qui râlent, la banlieue c'est une spirale
Où il y a tout plein de petites Diam's
Y'a de la rage dans les blocs, po po
Y'a des gosses dans les tops, po po
Et y a du monde à la porte, po po
Je suis fière d'être une nana, j'ai la dalle depuis le cartable
C'est pour tous les couche-tard d'ici à Gwadada

Admiral Twin,"Once upon a time
I was rattling around
Like a songbird that you prized
But it never made a sound

Someone told me not to come
They told me not to look
But you know I never take advice
And one time is all it took

I thought hey, I'd treat you like an aeroplane
I'd feed you clouds and vapor trails
We'd go for walks on Everest
We would sleep underneath
The watchful eye of the crescent moon

It might seem ludicrous
I know it sounds cliché
But when she walks into the room
She brings a brighter day

Can't help but watch her every move
While I pretend to look away
Smitten, bound and gagged
But if I got the chance I'd say

I'd say, ""Hey, I'll treat you like an aeroplane""
I'll catch you like a falling star
I'll be your hero astronaut
And we'll sleep underneath
The waterfall of the Milky Way

But if I wait a little while
I might find the nerve
To find the words to say to her
I find the timing's right
To wait a little while, a little while

Perfect is a number
That you're not allowed to say
So when she put me on the spot
I quickly coined a phrase

I said, ""Hey, I'll treat you like an aeroplane""
I'll feed you clouds and vapor trails
We'll go for walks on Everest
And we'll sleep underneath the waterfall
Yeah, we'll sleep underneath
The watchful eye of the crescent moon.

Admiral Twin,"It's just another day

It's just another day

A critical word's a betrayal
But the judge won't state my crime
When I find myself on trial
I always end up doing time

Another day on the track
Another day on my back

The sky looks blue
And all but I'm tied to the track
She pretends that
She can't hear me falling apart

You don't really want me, but you'd better believe

I'm the ghost in your closet when you turn the lights out
I'm rattling 'round through your bones
I know all your secret designs and amusements
I'm listening on the phone

You're afraid of the outside

You don't really want me, but you'd better believe
I'm better than nothing at all

And when we kiss you'll be there
I'm the thorn in your side when you're trying to be cool

Does it matter much that I'm such a pariah?
You're tired and bored with yourself
We could be a royal couple of nothings

Safe in bed, eyes open wide
The world's a giant place
And you just wonder on and on
Because it's free

Like Christmas eve
Every night you've wishful dreams
Outside your window-pane
There's sounds and city lights
But all your sight is gleaned
On something else

And it's intangible, this feeling in your soul
Some strange, enchanted inspiration
You are the special one
Blessed imperial, your world is out of sight
And it's intangible, this feeling in your soul

Some strange, enchanted inspiration, you are the special one
Blessed imperial, your world is out of sight
When it's late at night, silver stardust in your eyes

Need always leads to trust, you know
And trust is a game we don't play well

And you don't have to say you want me

Blink once if you want to be near me
Twice if you'd rather I live in Hell

I would beg you not to leave me but you're here
I would tell you to walk out on me today
But you're half a world away

You don't have to say you forgive me
I don't wanna make you a liar
You've said it so many times before
Thus quoth the raven nevermore

And you don't have to say you love me
That's a fire you've come to hate
It used to warm your throat like wine
But now you're burning my valentines

I would beg you not to leave me but you're here
I would tell you to walk out on me today

I'll take the blame for one solitary life

Cold fright, something's wrong

When I catch a glimpse from way down here

And I've known traitors and deceivers, kinder than that
If you're such a saint, don't leave me

I have been an ornament for hoods
And I've been the driver of a car
But now, I've left the driving up to her
And she does not know or care where we are

And calendars map the places, we've never been

We walk under ladders, as a matter of course
Jump on every crack, we can find
Thirteen a day, if we get half a chance
So call us The Unlucky Ones

Out in the black cat infested night
We dance on ledges and spires
With losers and liars, we don't have a thing to fear

""A healthy baby boy""
October 4th of 1925

His parents had a plan
He'd live a better life
Be a man of means
Who knows, he might go really far

And then the days slipped by
And turned into years
And many pages turned in the story of his life

Took a detour through a war
Cast a shadow across his soul
October 4th of 1944

Stories he would never tell
So he had to write them down to keep them captive
On Veteran's Day he pulls them out
It's a cleansing of the soul and a freeing of his mind

He didn't change the world
But he eventually met a girl
Their child would be his only legacy

And so he cried to God
""It's not what I had planned
And there's one more thing
I'll never understand

How did the days slip by
When did they turn into years?""
How many pages did you get for the story of your life?

Call it what you will, name it tragedy
But in the end he just looks back and smiles
It's just his life

You opened your mouth but before you could speak

I said no, I really, don't think, I want to know
I really, don't think, I want to go that far, now
Let's just stay right where we are now
Live, well enough, alone

I squint at the road but I can still see
Windshield reflections, you're staring at me
You've something to say, that I don't want to hear
And it gets hard to drive, when I'm covering my ears

So, I say no, I really, don't think, I want to know
I really, don't think, I want to go that far down
I'd rather stay uninvolved now

These fevered confessions, frighten me and though you're my friend
I swear, if you don't stop soon, it's a long walk home again

You just won't quit, what made you believe
I wanted to hear the secrets you keep?
Now, I see what it takes, your head hits the windshield
When I hit the brakes

'Cause I said no, I really, don't think, I want to know
I really, don't think, I want to go that far now

You're losing oxygen

Do you remember when
You were all about me
Or am I just a myth?
I loved you hardest
Happy, just loving you
And to be honest
Sometimes I think I still do

You're losing oxygen
And I can't find the words
The air is getting thin

Ah ah ah

Querer así es un pecao

No sé vivir si no te tengo y a mi vera

Y es la verdad 
Que quererte más no puedo
Y el pensarlo me da miedo
Tu no te vayas a equivocar

Y es que es tanto lo que te quiero 
Que no lo podría aguantar

Quiero que me beses 
Y a media voz decirte que te amo 
Y hablame bajito 
Que nadie se entere 
Lo que nos contamos 
Quiero que me beses 
Que nadie se entere 
Lo que nos amamos

Por ti seré un angelito 
Y guardaré tu corazón 
Y borraré más los recuerdos 
Y te daré la luz de luna 
Que tu corazón buscaba

Y quiero ser 
Ese brillo de tu mirada
Un reflejo de tu alma

Adrian Bal,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you

Got as far as the door

Don't get around much anymore

Like my mother sang to me
One with a good old-fashioned harmony
Play some simple melody

Musical demon, set your honey a-dreamin',
Won't you play me some rag
Just change that classical nag to some sweet beautiful drag
If you will play from a copy of a tune 
That is choppy you'll get all my applause
And that is simply because I wanna listen to rag

Play for me
That good old-fashioned harmony

Someone I’ve needed so long

I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue

How much to discover
What chemical forces flow from lover to lover!
How little we understand what touches off that tingle,
That sudden explosion when two tingles intermingle.

I took a walk into the back of my mind
Through the trash and the warning signs
There was a party full of jokes and clich's
I couldn't think of anything to say
And so I slipped into the men's room there
I saw my hair a way it's never been before

I took the stairs from my head to my heart
I didn't know they were so far apart
The heart is like a little chapel somewhere,
The pretty lights and the empty chairs
But I'm gonna bring a broom next time
I'll sweep out all the broken strings I find

She walks me down to my private train
And lays me down in my sleeping car
She keeps my elephant out of the rain
And sees to the care of my vintage cars
She is the blood of my life
Without her I would starve

Who you gonna run to?
Who you gonna hide behind?
Who you gonna turn to
When there's nobody home but you?

What's a father to do
With all theses school-less injuns
Running in circles around the wagons
What's a father to do
With all these monster debts
Around my neck
On a sad sun deck
Oh, my children, the times are jaded
The simple life is complicated
Oh, my children

Now if the dark of the night
Arrives in the middle of the day
I'm gonna say my prayer
For sweetness and light,
Gonna fix myself a Coke,
And hope it's alright

If the bat-winged beast sweep down
For a feast on me
I'm gonna pin my soul
To a hot-air balloon
Gonna make it pop
And shoot me to the moon

Now you've had another piece of my mind,
A cup of coffee and a slice of time
If you'll excuse me I should say goodbye
I gotta go now.",1967

Bad days must be on my tracks
'cause i heard my baby saying
She won't be coming back

I could've told you she was tired of my ways
I had no more surprises up my sleeve
But when she went away it sure surprised me, oh

'cause i sense my baby's never
She's never coming back
Bad days must be here to stay
'cause it seems so long since she
Since she went away

I couldn't move beneath the heavy weight
I heard somebody at my backyard gate, oh
There she was coming through the haze saying
""hold me, baby, and i hope i'm not too late""
Bad days are never coming again

To be caught up by their necks
In their greedy fishing nets

Were to fall into the sea

And all the homeless people lying on the pavement
All the desperate people clinging to their greed
While all the lonely people close their eyes to dream...

In front of me
With cafe` au lait
And some kind of cookie
Outside the window
There`s a wide and gentle canal
Two swans swim in it,
In their mirror images
They must be in love
The handsome Holland people
Ride ecological bikes
Or sometimes their dogs
Might take them along for a hike,

And stepped in some old Dutch dog shit,
It began to rain
A strange enchanted mist
And I love the cookies here
I could live forever here

With our love to keep us up
There is nothing in the world
That can knock us down
We can take whatever comes
If we face it hand in hand
We can stand our ground

Just a couple of kids with clouds in our heads
Trying to swim upstream, trying to make it good
But it happened so fast, when disaster came
That a river of teardrops couldn't wash it away

How do we now view ourselves,
Sitting victims in a shelter needing help?
How do we now regain control
Over the remnants of our life without a home?

If a bomb had hit us, nothing less would remain
Not a wall to lean on, not a fork or a plate
But at least we made it out and we're still alive
And we're starting over now in the middle of the night

It's a matter of time, a struggle to survive
But it doesn't need to be a lonely fight
If we stand by each other
We'll be sure of our survival in the wild

Y un perfume de yuyos y de alfalfa
Que me llena de nuevo el corazón

Recostado en la vidriera y esperándote

Ya nunca alumbraré con las estrellas

Tus veinte años temblando de cariño
Bajo el beso que entonces te robé

Nostalgias de las cosas que han pasado
Arena que la vida se llevó
Pesadumbre de barrios que han cambiado
Y amargura del sueño que murió

",Sir
Adrian Ingram,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

You'll start in dog-walkin' no matter where.
There's jazz-copation blues modulation,
Just like a Haitian you'll rip and tear.
Most everybody likes the blues

Here's why I'm ravin', here's why I'm ravin'
If it's blues you are cravin' just come on down.
You'll hear 'em playin', you'll hear 'em playin'
Soon you'll be sayin', ""Hon jazz me 'round""
Because your feet they can't refuse.

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane,
Can't keep still, tho' it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree,
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues, 
The Royal Garden Blues.

Everybody grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan? 
Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, 
Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, 
When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, 
Say, but it's soothing to the brain;
Just wanna get right up and dance, 
Don't care I'll take most any chance;
No other blues I'd care to choose, 
But Royal Garden Blues.",Royal Garden Blues

He don't plant cotton
Them that plants 'em is soon forgotten
But ol' man river
He keeps rolling along

We sweat and strain
Body all aching
And wracked with pain

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me

Que ainda tem coragem de dizer
Que os meus versos não contêm mensagem
São palavras frias, sem nenhum valor

Oh! Deus, será que o senhor não está vendo isto
Então por que é que o senhor mandou Cristo
Aqui na Terra semear amor
Quando se tem alguém que ama de verdade
Serve de riso pra humanidade
É um covarde, um fraco, um sonhador

Se é que hoje tudo está tão diferente
Por que não deixa eu mostrar a essa gente
Que ainda existe o verdadeiro amor
Faça ela voltar de novo pra o meu lado
Eu me sujeito a ser sacrificado
Salve seu mundo com a minha dor",Loucura
Adriana Calcanhotto,"Você sabe o que é ter um amor, meu senhor
Ter loucura por uma mulher
E depois encontrar esse amor, meu senhor
Nos braços de um tipo qualquer
Você sabe o que é ter um amor, meu senhor
E por ele quase morrer
E depois encontrá-lo em um braço
Que nem um pedaço do seu pode ser
Há pessoas de nervos de aço
Sem sangue nas veias e sem coração
Mas não sei se passando o que eu passo
Talvez não lhes venha qualquer reação
Eu não sei se o que trago no peito
É ciúme, despeito, amizade ou horror
Eu só sei é que quando a vejo
Me dá um desejo de morte ou de dor",Nervos de Aço
Adriana Calcanhotto,"Quem há de dizer
Que quem você esta vendo
Naquela mesa bebendo
É o meu querido amor
Repare bem que toda vez
Que ela fala
Ilumina mais a sala
Do que a luz do refletor
O cabaré se inflama
Quando ela dança
E com a mesma esperança
Todos lhe põe o olhar
E eu, o dono
Aqui no meu abandono
Espero louco de sono
O cabaré terminar

Rapaz! Leva esta mulher contigo
Disse uma vez um amigo
Quando nos viu conversar
Vocês se amam
E o amor deve ser sagrado
O resto deixa de lado
Vai construir o teu lar

Ela nasceu com o destino da lua
Pra todos que andam na rua
Não vai viver só pra mim",Quem Há de Dizer

No meu chatô encontrasse aquela mulher 
Que você gostou
Será que tinha coragem 
De trocar nossa amizade 
Por ela que já te abandonou

Eu falo porque essa dona 
Já mora no meu barraco 
À beira de um regato 
E um bosque em flor

De dia me lava a roupa 
De noite me beija a boca
E assim nós vamos vivendo de amor",Se Acaso Você Chegasse
Adriana Calcanhotto,"Eu gostei tanto
Tanto quando me contaram
Que lhe encontraram
Bebendo e chorando
Na mesa de um bar

E que quando os amigos do peito
Por mim perguntaram
Um soluço cortou sua voz
Não lhe deixou falar

Eu gostei tanto
Tanto, quando me contaram
Que tive mesmo de fazer esforço
Pra ninguém notar

O remorso talvez seja a causa
Do seu desespero
Ela deve estar bem consciente
Do que praticou
Me fazer passar esta vergonha
Com um companheiro
E a vergonha
É a herança maior que meu pai me deixou

Mas, enquanto houver força em meu peito
Eu não quero mais nada
Só vingança, vingança, vingança

Que rolam na estrada
Sem ter nunca um cantinho de seu

There will never be an angel so kind as my Adeline

The jester and queen, the almighty queen
Royal whispers lingering
I can turn death into a joke
But the night I roam the cobblestone, my heart aches me so

Burning a hole in my sky
So fierce, so bright

And maybe it's all I need
So baby, come shoot through me

On the ground, I think you could
It's not a life that you lead
It's just a path following

Con tanto sole, tanti anni fa
Quelle domeniche da solo
In un cortile, a passeggiar
Ora mi annoio più di allora
Neanche un prete per chiacchierar

Azzurro
Il pomeriggio è troppo azzurro
E lungo per me
Mi accorgo
Di non avere più risorse
Senza di te
E allora
Io quasi quasi prendo il treno
E vengo, vengo da te
Ma il treno dei desideri
Nei miei pensieri all'incontrario va

Cerco un po' d'Africa in giardino
Tra l'oleandro e il baobab
Come facevo da bambino
Ma qui c'è gente, non si può più
Stanno innaffiando le tue rose
Non c'è il leone, chissà dov'è

Azzurro
Il pomeriggio è troppo azzurro
E lungo per me
Mi accorgo
Di non avere più risorse
Senza di te

E vengo, vengo da te

Adriano Celentano,"Questa è la storia
Di uno di noi
Anche lui nato per caso in via gluck
In una casa, fuori città
Gente tranquilla, che lavorava
Là dove c'era l'erba ora c'è
Una città
E quella casa
In mezzo al verde ormai
Dove sarà

Questo ragazzo della via gluck
Si divertiva a giocare con me
Ma un giorno disse
Vado in città
E lo diceva mentre piangeva
Io gli domando amico
Non sei contento
Vai finalmente a stare in città
Là troverai le cose che non hai avuto qui
Potrai lavarti in casa senza andar
Giù nel cortile

Mio caro amico, disse
Qui sono nato
In questa strada
Ora lascio il mio cuore
Ma come fai a non capire
È una fortuna, per voi che restate
A piedi nudi a giocare nei prati
Mentre là in centro respiro il cemento
Ma verrà un giorno che ritornerò
Ancora qui
E sentirò l'amico treno
Che fischia così
""wa wa""

Passano gli anni
Ma otto son lunghi
Però quel ragazzo ne ha fatta di strada
Ma non si scorda la sua prima casa
Ora coi soldi lui può comperarla
Torna e non trova gli amici che aveva
Solo case su case
Catrame e cemento

Là dove c'era l'erba ora c'è
Una città
E quella casa in mezzo al verde ormai
Dove sarà

Ehi, ehi

La la la la la la la la

Eh no
Non so, non so perché
Perché continuano
A costruire, le case
E non lasciano l'erba
Non lasciano l'erba
Non lasciano l'erba
Non lasciano l'erba

Eh no
Se andiamo avanti così, chissà
Come si farà
Chissà",Il  Ragazzo Della Via Gluck [Parlato]

Adriano Celentano,"E' inutile suonare qui non ti aprirà nessuno 
Il mondo l'abbiam chiuso fuori 
Con il suo casino 
Una bugia coi tuoi 
Il frigo pieno e poi 
Un calcio alla tivù 
Solo io solo tu 
E' inutile chiamare 
Non risponderà nessuno 
Il telefono è volato fuori 
Giù dal quarto piano 
Era importante sai 
Pensare un poco a noi 
Non stiamo insieme mai 
Ora sì ora qui 
Soli 
La pelle come un vestito 
Soli 
Mangiando un panino in due 
Io e te 
Soli 
Le briciole nel letto 
Soli 
Ma stretti un po' di più 
Solo io solo tu 
Il mondo dietro ai vetri sembra un film senza sonoro 
E il tuo pudore amando rende il 
Corpo tuo più vero 
Sei bella quando vuoi 
Bambina donna poi 
Non mi deludi mai 
È così che mi vai 
Soli 
Lasciando la luce accesa 
Soli 
Ma guarda nel cuore chi c'è 
Io e te 
Soli 
Col tempo che si è fermato 
Soli 
Però finalmente noi 
Solo noi solo noi 
Una bugia coi tuoi 
Il frigo pieno e poi 
Un calcio alla tivù 
Solo io solo tu 
Solo tu 
Solo tu",Soli
Adriano Celentano,"Io non so parlar d'amore
L'emozione non ha voce
E mi manca un po' il respiro
Se ci sei c'è troppa luce
La mia anima si spande
Come musica d'estate
Poi la voglia sai mi prende
E mi accende con i baci tuoi

Io con te sarò sincero
Resterò quel che sono
Disonesto mai lo giuro
Ma se tradisci non perdono

Ti sarò per sempre amico
Pur geloso come sai
Io lo so mi contraddico
Ma preziosa sei tu per me

Tra le mie braccia dormirai
Serenamente
Ed è importante questo sai
Per sentirci pienamente noi

Un'altra vita mi darai
Che io non conosco
La mia compagna tu sarai
Fino a quando so che lo vorrai

Due caratteri diversi
Prendon fuoco facilmente
Ma divisi siamo persi
Ci sentiamo quasi niente
Siamo due legati dentro
Da un amore che ci dà
La profonda convinzione
Che nessuno ci dividerà
Tra le mie braccia dormirai
Serenamente
Ed è importante questo sai
Per sentirci pienamente noi

Un'altra vita mi darai
Che io non conosco
La mia compagna tu sarai
Fino a quando lo vorrai

Poi vivremo come sai
Solo di sincerità
Di amore e di fiducia
Poi sarà quel che sarà

Non dirmi di no
Vorrei saper qual è

Ma vedo che tu
Mi guardi silenziosa
E sembra che
Sei un'infelice sposa

Lo sai anche tu
Non si può senza amore
Mi dispero perchè
Anche se non dovrei
Io lo cerco in te

A volte si deve sognare
Giusto per andare avanti
Come faccio io
Illudendomi che
Starai con me

Almeno un po' mi pensi
Così poi vivrò
Si tanti sogni densi

Ma dimmi sono
Il tuo bicchiere di vino
Che può ubriacarti un po'

Stai pur sicura che
Io lo capirò

Grazie preferisco di no
Non ballo il tango col casquè

Adriano Celentano,"Questa è la storia
di uno di noi,
anche lui nato per caso in via Gluck,
in una casa, fuori città,
gente tranquilla, che lavorava.
Là dove see'era l'erba ora see'è
una città,
e quella casa
in mezzo al verde ormai,
dove sarà?

Questo ragazzo della via Gluck,
si divertiva a giocare con me,
ma un giorno disse,
vado in città,
e lo diceva mentre piangeva,
io gli domando amico,
non sei contento?
Vai finalmente a stare in città.
Là troverai le cose che non hai avuto qui,
potrai lavarti in casa senza andar
giù nel cortile!

Mio caro amico, disse,
qui sono nato,
in questa strada
ora lascio il mio cuore.
Ma come fai a non capire,
è una fortuna, per voi che restate
a piedi nudi a giocare nei prati,
mentre là in centro respiro il cemento.
Ma verrà un giorno che ritornerò
ancora qui
e sentirò l'amico treno
che fischia così,
""wa wa""!

Passano gli anni,
ma otto son lunghi,
però quel ragazzo ne ha fatta di strada,
ma non si scorda la sua prima casa,
ora coi soldi lui può comperarla
torna e non trova gli amici che aveva,
solo case su case,
catrame e cemento.

Là dove see'era l'erba ora see'è
una città,
e quella casa in mezzo al verde ormai
dove sarà.

Ehi, Ehi,

La la la... la la la la la...

Eh no,
non so, non so perché,
perché continuano
a costruire, le case
e non lasciano l'erba
non lasciano l'erba
non lasciano l'erba
non lasciano l'erba

Eh no,
se andiamo avanti così, chissà
come si farà,
chissà...",Il Ragazzo Della Via Gluck [Live]
Adriano Celentano,"Ti proteggerò dalle paure delle ipocondrie
Dai turbamenti che da oggi incontrerai per la tua via
Dalle ingiustizie e dagli inganni del tuo tempo
Dai fallimenti che per tua natura normalmente attirerai

Ti sollleverò dai dolori e dai tuoi sbalzi d'umore
Dalle ossessioni delle tue manie
Supererò le correnti gravitazionali
Lo spazio e la luce per non farti invecchiare
E guarirai da tutte le malattie

Perchè sei un essere speciale
Ed io avrò cura di te

Vagavo per I campi del Tennessee
Come vi ero arrivato chissà
Non hai fiori bianchi per me?
Più veloci di aquile I miei sogni

Attraversano il mare
Ti porterò soprattutto il silenzio e la pazienza
Percorreremo assieme le vie che portano all'essenza
I profumi d'amore inebrieranno I nostri corpi
La bonaccia d'Agosto non calmerà I nostri sensi

Tesserò I tuoi capelli come trame di un canto
Conosco le leggi del mondo e te ne farò dono
Supererò le correnti gravitazionali
Lo spazio e la luce per non farti invecchiare
Ti salverò da ogni malinconia

Perchè sei un essere speciale
Ed io avrò cura di te
Io sì che avrò cura di te

Sans plus tarder mon coeur, fuyons comme des voleurs 
Et dans la carte postale, oublions tous tes drames 
Les mains dans le sable, les pieds dans le bleu 
J’en veux de ta flamme, dans mes yeux, dans mes yeux 
Maintenant chéri, si tu m’aimes, si tu m’aimes 
Viens-y, viens-y, viens-y, viens-y... !

Dans mes bras, dans mes bras 
Ouais je sais ça fait peur 
Les yeux dans les yeux 
Dans mes bras, ça fait peur 

Dans mes bras pour t’aimer dans mes bras 
Sans craintes et sans remords, laisse-le à moi ton cœur 
Et si les autres femmes tu les hantes, moi tu m’auras vivante 
Car c’est bien trop facile de toujours s’échapper 
Ouais je sais t’es sensible, ouais je sais chéri mais 
Maintenant qu’on est tous les deux, si tu l’oses, si tu l’oses 
Montre-toi, montre-toi, montre-toi ...!

Dans mes bras,dans mes bras 
Ouais je sais ça fait peur 
Les yeux dans les yeux 
Dans tes bras ça fait peur 

Dans les bras, de la mer dis-le moi 
Si tu m’aimes et sans détours, vite avant que je me noie 
...Que tu m’aimes et pour toujours embrasse-moi mon amour 
Perdue dans le bleu, du sable dans les yeux 
Non ! je sais pas nager, viens m’chercher, viens m’chercher 
Puisqu’il faut bien s’en sortir nous deux 
Maintenant si tu m’aimes un peu, sauve-moi!

Sur mon piano à fric

J´enregistre, j´enregistre
En attendant, j´encaisse,

Tout en bois blanc placez-moi d´vant
Un jour c´est sûr, j´leur montrerai
Les pieds devant je partirai

Dans ma caisse maboule
Direction j´encaisse pas

De serrer la main aux vieilles biques
Dans ma vieille caisse je reviendrai

Juste une sale bête : le méchant cafard

Qui veut pas, elle m´embête avec ses mots en retard
Qui me tourne la tête, ça me fout en pétard

Ah, si je pouvais trouver une fin!
La la la la la la la
Mais ça se commande pas une fin
La la la la la la la

Ah, si je pouvais la rêver!
La trouver sur mon oreiller
Entre deux pétards, ça m´a tuée
Entre deux cafards, je vais me coucher

Très allongée dans mes beaux draps

Now I, I am never going back
I, I am never going back, never going back under
Never going back, can't do that
Never going back under that cloud

Tried to pull you away from that blue TV light
And show you that there's still stars in the sky
I was searching through pages of the wrong book
Everything is right outside I just had to look

And I used to watch all the dark clouds form

Now I, I am never going back

Never going back, can't do that
Never going back under that cloud

Don't imagine they can give your windows bars
Don't back down, don't apologize
You are perfectly imperfect in my eyes

Blinded by Stars


My blood does remember the rhythm of a drum

Beat by a boy soldier whose revolution won

I?ve carried pretty flowers to fallen heroes graves

& stood in silence honoring the price our fathers paid


This was their flag but this ain?t their fight

Dirty with oil tattered by spite

This was their flag but this ain?t their fight


So what do you call justice & what is freedom for

Don?t let the towncrier decide if we go to war

'cause this ain?t about your medla

The choice is of the soul

& hate is never brave while mercy?s always, always sold


Blinded by stars tangled in stripes

This is our flag but this ain?t our fight

Dirty with oil tattered by spite

This is our flag but this ain?t our fight

This is my flag but this ain?t my fight


Now I was born a rebel, I question what I?m told

No wonder this young skin I?m wearin?

Feels so old


Don?t be blinded by stars tangled in stripes

This is our flag but this ain?t our fight

Dirty with oil tattered by spite

This is our flag but this ain?t our fight

This I s my flag but this ain?t my fight

Lonesome Road Blues


I walked on down that lonesome line

Hung my head and I cried

I wept and I cried under a willow tree

Out by the deep blue sea

My mama, my dear papa can be found,

And my brother on a county road

Now I been down that long plank walk,

I?m on my way back home


You cause me to weep, you do cause me to moan

You cause me to leave my home

I cried last night and the night before

I swear I won?t cry anymore


Your fast mail train comin round that track

Killed my brown eyed boy

They took him down that smokey track

Brought him back on a cooling board

Now I?m lookin down that lonesome line

Just as far as I care to see

I have no money lost my brown eyed boy

These blues won?t set me free


You do cause me to weep, you do cause me to moan

You cause me to leave my home

I cried last night and the night before

I swear I won?t cry anymore


",Lonesome Road Blues
Adrienne Young,"Gonna take a long time to get over you
Love's poison addiction offers me no rescue
Gonna be a hard road back to where I started from
'Cause you touched the deepest part of me and filled me
With your song
And I sang along

I believe in you and what you gotta do
But what you're goin' through is poison,
Poison to the two of us
Used to stand so tall
'Til I took the fall, greatest fall of all
Was when I fell for you

Our cloudy skies held lonely forms
Your anger familiar thick as air before a storm
Now lookin' back I know the truth was plain to see
I built my world around you 'cause I
I needed to believe
And I still believe

Time and time again we tried so hard to win
But the pleasures of a foolish paradise
Is nothing but a sin",Poison

Sadie?s Song


Pretty boy, my faithless fallen angel

Took me completely in his arms

In his eyes, I saw Eden?s garden

But the serpent lay hidden in his charms

Well I used to love to sing with the sunlight in my hair

Til that fateful day when I followed him there


He said, climb, little Sadie higher

Spread them downy wings and fly

You will find your crown of gilded glory next to mine

Climb, little Sadie, climb


Icy winds up on Lookout Mountain

Chilled two bodies to the bone

But for that man, I did gladly lay down my back

Upon a bed of stone

Well I used to love to sing with the sunlight in my hair

Til that fateful day when I followed him there


Something?s wrong, I heard my voices whisper

I heard ?em whisper something?s wrong

A single shot, he said, ?Fare thee well, Sadie?

The round was cold, my breath was gone

Well I used to love to sing with the sunlight in my hair

Til that fateful day when I followed him there

My Sin is Pride

I let you walk away

I kept it all inside

Swore you?d be back someday

My Sin Is Pride


I could have reached out to you

But I felt like my hands were tied

I?m always bound to prove

My Sin Is pride


Wasted so many words

When I told the truth I lied

I never will confess

My Sin Is Pride


I?ve chosen a narrow path

Lost sight of the road so wide

But I never will look back

Nobody sees the pain

Nobody knows I?ve cried

I never will confess

Walls of Jericho

Adrieenne Young


Lookin? much older

With dust on your shoulder

Well you crashed in this mornin?

Wearin? only your pride

Highways and freight trains

Drivers with no names

Well you played such a god game it was easy to ride


With a Poor Man?s scheme and

Rich Man?s dream

You ran for your life

Over El Rio into Laredo it was do or die

The stars hung bright on the other side


Well I offered a cold beer

And I said you could stay here

I swallowed my own fear

'cause I knew what was right

We spoke in a language that was

Here before Cambridge

Colored bright terracotta and aquamarine


With a Poor Boy?s Dream and a

Rich man?s scheme

You sacrificed the warmth of your wife?s hand

Your children and homeland for a roll lof dice

A bitter slice of American Pie


Mighty walls of Jericho

Toppled by the sound of tiny feet

Trumpets sound and we will know

Just who?s sitting in the driver?s seat

Oh these walls are comin? down

Getting back to the ground

And there?ll be victory

In the sound of their defeat


Well you slept when the dawn came

So I undid the latch chain I walked

Down to the riverbank and thought about life

Just when did this happen

Was it always the fashion

Playin? just to win disregarding the price


Such a Rich Man?s scheme using

Poor Boy?s dreams

To fight the fight

How far will we go pretending we don?t know what is wrong or right

The stars hang bright on the other side


Mighty walls of Jericho

Toppled by the sound of tiny feet

Trumpets sound and we will know

Just who?s sitting in the driver?s seat

Oh these walls are comin? down

Getting back to the ground

And there?ll be victory

In the sound of their defeat

Though all my brothers fade away, I will hold to you

Conviction has stripped away with time

Crushing those that held to you
And in your place, we dug a shallow grave
Hoping to see a change, a resurrection

And so we fight for the heart
Holding nothing back till we see the sun on the horizon
Bringing light to this barren wasteland, power of ages old
Held in the mighty hands of God
Pushed out and thrown away like a painful memory

Pressing towards our destruction, our decimation

Aeon Spoke,"Fading in the afterglow
I wrinkle in my mind another fear
With ears beside the bedroom door
I close my eyes to keep inside the tears
The question of its worth won't iron out
It's tearing at the very thing I feel

I'm still Pablo at the park
Where's my Gloria when it's hard
How my mind has changed so much
But my heart's the same

He loves and then he hurts some more
It takes a generous man to lose something
Will I know what it means to see the pain through different eyes?
But nothing seems to work this time
I'll live inside the burden till I've healed

I'm still Pablo at the park
I'll find Gloria when it's hard
How my mind has changed so much
But my heart's the same

But nothing seems to work this time
I'm still Pablo at the park
And I've got Gloria when it's hard
How my mind has changed so much
But I'm still Pablo
I'm still Pablo

On the ground a newspaper reads
The blood has spilled again
And you just dream my yellowman

The angels burn a torch to keep us warm

His lungs are wide awake but he won't breathe
He spits out the ocean and we dream
Like goldfish in a bowl
They think we're free

Aer,"She always says she loves me when we're drinkin'
Won't admit it but it's true
I think I've had enough of this one

She always says she loves me when we're drinkin'
Won't admit it but it's true
I think I've had enough of this one
So baby what's your name where you from what's good with you

When she's drunk she calls me a punk
She blow my phone up, she don't know what's up
When she drink that Jack
She won't call back, and when she off that rum
She acts so dumb
She tells me grow up! I say you know what?
She won't let me finish, she starts to go nuts
Stop throwing stuff, time to own up
I'm so done baby I'm so done
All I need to do is turn my back, and she'll be gone for good
Finished packing my bags, going where I know I should
It's only right for me to move on to what's next
But when she texts me with those three words it gets me like

She always says she loves me when we're drinkin'
Won't admit it but it's true

Won't admit it but it's true

So baby what's your name where you from what's good with you

And go pick someone else who can handle her shit
I'm so sick of this and I can't pretend
But I'll be stuck with this girl like wet cement, yeah
I don't want her following in my footsteps
But I think my shadow needs it
Despite her good side, and some good sex
I'd rather go through amnesia
Like forget all about it
No reason to always get so dramatic
I'm more manual, she automatic
Oh oh
Tryna get rid of her static
I got smacked last night, it makes sense tonight
Well it's time to tell her I've had enough

She always says she loves me when we're drinkin'
Won't admit it but it's true

Let's start new
I wasn't planning on it but I'm likin' you
And we just met
But I get you
You seem like the type that got something to prove
Come on and dance
Let's see you move
This ain't the first time that I noticed you
Take off those heels

And their babies cry while Cindys lie at my feet

Aerosmith,"Arriving in boats, black hooded coats
Tormentors climbed into my room
I crawled under my bed, covered my head
But they're flushin' me out with a broom
The leader, she's small, pinned my ass to the wall
For my seeds or she'd be losin' her past
Time after time, she'd be readin' my mind
But she never got the feelin' to last
Celebrate, celebrate, celebraid it
This is the critical mass
So far so good, I heard the other say
So good so far, they're takin' me away
I drink to you, your mind, her ass
We'll take a drink and break the glass
Celebrate, celebrate, celebreak it
This is the critical mass
Now the tallest of two, with a brush full of blue
Paints surrealist scenes on the wall
So I tell her for fun, that it's really well done
But she just ain't listenin' at all
She points to my heart, tellin' me if I'm smart
I'll practice and phase
Out and admit, when the shoe doesn't fit
And I went screaming out down the hall
Need it
Need your love
Just then I heard a poundin' on the door
We're all here, sang the voice of twenty more
I drink to you alas, we'll take a drink and break the glass
Celebrate, celebrate, celebreak it

Were ruled by lords of greed
Maidens fared with gold they dared
To bare their wombs that bleed
Kings and queens and guillotines 
Taking lives denied
Starch and parchment laid the laws 
When bishops took the ride
Only to deceive
Oh I know I 
Lived this life afore
Somehow I know now 
Truths I must be sure
Tossin', turnin', nightmares burnin'
Dreams of swords in hand
Sailing ships, the Viking spits
The blood of father's land
Only to deceive
Living times of knights and mares
Raising swords for maidens fair
Sneer at death, fear only loss of pride
Living other centuries
