The Incredible String Band,"Waiting For You Lyrics
I've been wearing faces in the strangest places
Just to make a dream come true
The dawn is sweet but it's incomplete and l'm waiting for you
The breeze is blowing and my hair is growing
Forgotten everything my mother knew
The day is young and spring is sprung and I'm waiting for you
Must you bring that horse in here Miss Jones
(although your snowshoes do look terrific)
Yes they all come from out of the sky you know
I'm waiting for the dove that never came home
I'm waiting for the painter when his colours were gone
I'm waiting for the soldiers at the war, I'm waiting for a royal decision
I'm waiting for the sun to snore
I'm waiting for a rumble from Jericho, waiting for the world to begin
I'm a bareback rider, I'm an outsider and love to dance the boogaloo
I'm a turnip head, I'm a lately wed and I'm waiting for you
More tea vicar? (Hold that tiger)
Yes, the hydrangeas do look divine this time of the year
I'm wailing for the angels to put on their smiles
I'm waiting for the judges to come to trial
I'm waiting for the aeroplane, I'm waiting for the graves to open
I'm waiting to be sold in chains
I'm waiting for a signal from the trapdoor queen
Waiting for the world to begin
I'm a snake charmer, I'm a guava farmer
I'm a goose to me don't ever say boo
Let the universe roll, I'm a simple soul and I'm waiting for you
Oh it sounds so sweet when you play it me like that..
(that tiger really doesn't want to be held)
I'm waiting for the signs to point a different way
I'm waiting for God to take a holiday
I'm waiting for night in the mine
I'm waiting for the hills to grow steeper
I'm waiting for the man they call Shine
I'm waiting for Willie the Weeper to wake,
Waiting for the world to begin
I'm off to market with an old straw basket singing dodeodeodo
Green cloth to wear in the spring, in the April breezes how it will blow
I'm going to introduce to you now the
Personalities who compose the Jim Spiggatt Occult Quart.
Over there on my left we have Miss Cynthia de Monfort-Jones on her silvery toned
Mandoline, and just a little further over the left we have that famed Oriental bass player
Miss Fenola Bumgarner (first time in captivity folks!)
On the pounding batterie and coterie we
Have that well known bricklayer's labourer from Pilton,
Mr Jack McMarker- and perhaps we just have time to devastate your synaesthesia
With one more searing chorus from Black Jack Davy on the steam organ. That's all.",Waiting for You
The Incredible String Band,"Started rubbing my eyes
When I heard the birds talk
Hey mister sleep you're gonna
Have to take walk
But nothing has as much power to
Make me rise as the post man
Bringing a morning surprise

Here he comes
Here he comes
Too much I've got a letter
I'd better get out of bed
I said

Then I pulled the covers right
Up to my nose
I thought well the letter
Might be for Rose
Her mother she writes very regularly
Mister Postman have you got
A letter for me

Mr. Heron, yes I have yes I have
Too much I've got a letter
I said with some joy
It came from Maria, Chicago, Illinois

And I never have met her but she sounds sweet
Like a flower
Grown on a rubbish heap
She's got a lot of things around her
She's gotta work out
But she's gonna make it
And I have no doubt

Maria, the plane that brought your letter must have
Felt a little bit lighter
The air hostess must've felt brighter bringing your letter over the sea
And the pilot was your Orpheus
Singing a song for you
Maria I'm singing
Hear me singing I'll be your Orpheus too

By the time you hear this song your
Troubles will be gone
And you'll be left with what's shining
Through your letter you 

By the time you hear this song your
Troubles will be gone
And you'll be left with what's shining
Through your letter you",The Letter
The Incredible String Band,"Deep in the hollow jail
Sleeps Lord Randall
The mixed voices speak of bread
And of sheets that were scarlet
And blue are at his head
His heart like a cat drowns in a well
He thinks of all the girls he will not love
He thinks not of the future or of the past
Blue lightning spikes the hills above the sea
Where Kasa's ship sets
Sail for other where
There stands the chief with
Gold on his hair
Two fingers thick each link of coiled ore
Speaks to his white skinned
Wife she answers not
He hurls his question angry to the gulls
His wife strikes her mouth
With a skull like sound
The bleeding image of her loss
Revolves above her mind
With every line in its design
An accusing eye
That pierces Kasa's soul
The slaves row on beneath
The dragon flag
His heart recoils recall his red-haired son
Beneath the burning walls
That he razed down
His wife and he speak not
As wine is brought
A cup that seethes like the
Black blood of wolves
His wife's dagger is hidden in her dress
He drinks joyless to a dark sleep
The gaoler bangs the iron door
Lord Randall wakes in pain
He shakes his shackles
In the beaten gloom
The blood of his wounds is hard as coal
The gaoler leads him out
Upon the blinding bright stair
He feels uneven turf beneath his feet
The priest intones, the sword
Falls on his neck
The pain is boiling cold
They lay him in the tomb
At the break of day
They close the earthen door
Upon his clay
The birds are plucking worms
From the ground
Their feathers grey as mist
On a cloudy morn
Foresters burn branches
From the sleeping trees
The white sun turns to stone
His mother lies in her labor
Nine days long
She called on Saint Bridget in her time
I looked out on the room of my  birth
With hangings rich of
Many strange designs
Nobles stand with their wine
Cups in the room
Saluting me and she the King's queen
Already I am forgetting who I am
Already I've forgotten who I've been
My mother lifts me up
To her huge soft breast
Her nipple like a berry both
Hard and brown
Her eyes look on me like waves of the sea
And with small lips
The yellow milk I draw",Pictures in a Mirror
The Incredible String Band,"When You Find Out Who You Are Lyrics
It's of a strange and furious time
When men did speed to pray
Along the road of discontent to gods of gold and clay

Some did seek security
Among the seas of change
And some did seek dear life to wound
A furious time and strange

But when you find out who you are
Beautiful beyond your dreams
Just look around and
Notice where you are

Just look around and notice what you see
Each moment born for you innocently
But when I see what we have made
What we have out with the mind's blade

In the blackness feel it all
Repeated faces rise and fall
With ancient goals unwondering fail
Further obscure the ancient trail

Filling with the endless years
The river of your heart's tears
I swear you have the power
As the angels do

Spread out your fingers and
Make all things new
Change the world by the things you say
By the things you love

And by the games you play
And you make each new day
It feels so funny in your mummy's tummy
Before you get born into

The world for to carry on
Remember young man of the time
Before you first went to school
How did it feel trying to live to the rule

Remember young man of the time
When your love stick
First rose free between your legs
Like a growing tree

Remember you walked with your lover
Like a gypsy and a gypsy queen
Under the stars where the sign was seen
Under the stars where

The leaves were green
Under the stars where the sign was seen
0 how many shining hearts
With love has guided me

And many I have met before
In lands across the sea
We used to speak of that ocean deep
How little words can say

It's better now to ask your friend
What makes him sad today
No one can do it for you
Make your own sky blue

Make your own dreams come true
Make it come true.",When You Find Out Who You Are
The Incredible String Band,"It was late in December, the sky turned to snow
All round the day was going down slow
Night like a river beginning to flow
I felt the beat of my mind go
Drifting into time passages
Years go falling in the fading light
Time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight

Well I'm not the kind to live in the past
The years run too short and the days too fast
The things you lean on are the things that don't last
Well it's just now and then my line gets cast into these
Time passages
There's something back here that you left behind
Oh time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight

Hear the echoes and feel yourself starting to turn
Don't know why you should feel
That there's something to learn
It's just a game that you play

Well the picture is changing
Now you're part of a crowd
They're laughing at something
And the music's loud
A girl comes towards you
You once used to know
You reach out your hand
But you're all alone, in these
Time passages
I know you're in there, you're just out of sight

The Incredible String Band,"The actor leaves the stage with a rose in his hand
He settles in the back seat his thoughts are like fine sand
Driven through the rain swept streets casting a melancholy stare
Upon two enraptured loves kissing without a care

The dreams of an actor spill slowly by
Like the thoughts of a dreamer or the casting of a die
Talking to gay fellows of the follies on which they perch
He saw a lovely lady beneath the arches of a church

Cigarettes in the airless twenties
An estate well filled with dust
In the evening reading Swinburne
Eating mightily with some false lust
But a kiss was what we found
On damp but friendly ground

The lady wore no makeup but she stood like a swan
Thin body of a dancer her dress was quietly torn
Her eyes searched his distant heart that lingered in the ram
But his friends caught his iron gaze and carried it away again

Broken hearted in the loveless twenties
Where a wink was like an embrace
Making love on blue fridays
From across some foggy space
But a kiss was what we found
On damp but friendly ground

Tea was like a mirror a reflection never there
His thoughts upon that ring of love that burned upon her stare
Her eyes her lips her chin her grace the rain upon her hair
Thus it gripped his white gloved heart can anyone be so fair

Untied in the breezy twenties
With a hand held in my arms
Bearing my heart to the hallowed spires
Of this quiet and ancient land
For a kiss was what we found
On damp but friendly ground",The Actor

Waiting for her to show up

At the lighthouse dance
Stepped outside took a look
Shook the sweat felt madly sad 
I was dreaming of angels
I saw the ships sinking
But one pulled in 
I asked the sea captain tell me where you've been

Oh do you die you masquerader
Oh do you land you space invader

To run on sands so white.
To buy her boat trips if you could
And watch her drink tea.

Everybody knows tears that fall

Something else that I just can't find without you

Without you I've got an emptiness

Than just about anything at all

Pick up, let me pick up
Let me pick up on your lovelight
Please let it shine on me, I want that more
Than just about anything at all

Little girl I love you, spend my walking hours in thoughts or you
You held your love light high
And it shone and it shone down on me
But you let it fall so low I could not see

Without you got emptiness
Without you I've got an emptiness

The Incredible String Band,"Sailor And The Dancer Lyrics
Beneath some shaded planet 
Before this earth was born
We came together

And we danced in the early dawn
For my hands contain ten dances
That shall bear us into the night
Into the sea

And the moon's morning light
Night mimed a bow
And broke into the day
Fair sailors and their cautious friends

Smiled on the sea
That reflected all their gazes
And danced with the air
The breezes filled the sails

High against the quay
High on the limpid waves the ship it did fly
Rising as a condor into the silvery sky
Passing through the arches that begin his earth

The sailors saw the scenic air
As air gave Earth it's birth
Gazing ahead towards today
They saw the fields of this world

They watched the first new dancers
As their bodies did unfurl.",Sailor and the Dancer
The Incredible String Band,"Winter was cold and the clothing was thin
But the gentle shepherd calls the tune
Oh, dear mother what shall I do?
First please your eyes and then your ears, Jenny
Exchanging love tokens say goodnight

Lay down my dear sister
Won't you lay and take your rest?
Won't you lay your head upon your saviors breast?
And I love you but Jesus loves you the best

And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Lord, I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

One of these mornings bright and early and fine
Goodnight, goodnight
Not a cricket, not a spirit going to shout me on
Goodnight, goodnight

I go walking in the valley of the shadow of death
Goodnight, goodnight
And his rod and his staff shall comfort me
Goodnight, goodnight

Oh John, the wine he saw the sign
Goodnight, goodnight
Oh, John say, ""I seen a number of signs""
Goodnight, goodnight

Tell a for the ark that wonderful boat
Goodnight, goodnight
You know they built it on the land getting water to float
Goodnight, goodnight

Oh, tell B for the beast at the ending of the wood
Goodnight, goodnight
You know it ate all the children when they wouldn't be good
Goodnight, goodnight

I remember quite well, I remember quite well
Goodnight, goodnight
And I was walking in Jerusalem just like John
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

Who would lose and who would bruise
Or who would live quite prettily?
And who would love what comes along
And fill the air with joyous song

Who would go and who would come
Or who would simply linger?
And who would hide behind your chair
And steal your crystallized ginger?

Nebulous nearnesses cry to me
At this timeless moment someone dear to me
Wants me near, makes me high
I can hear vibrations fly

Through mangoes, pomegranates and planes
All the same
When it reaches me and teaches me
To sigh

Who would mouse and who would lion
Or who would be the tamer?
And who would hear directions clear
From the unnameable namer?

Who would skip and who would plot
Or who would lie quite stilly?
And who would ride backwards on a giraffe?
Stopping every so often to laugh

Amoebas are very small

Oh ah ee oo
There's absolutely no strife
Living the timeless life, I don't need a wife
Living the timeless life

If I need a friend I just give a wriggle
Split right down the middle
And when I look there's two of me
Both as handsome as can be

Oh, here we go slithering, here we go
Slithering and squelching on
Oh, here we go slithering, here we go
Slithering and squelching on

Oh ah ee oo
There's absolutely no strife
Living the timeless life

Black hair, brown hair feather and scale
Seed and stamen and all unnamed lives that live
Turn your quivering nerves in my direction
Turn your quivering nerves in my direction
Feel the energy projection of my cells wishes you well

May the long time sun shine upon you
All love surround you
And the pure light within you
Guide you all the way on

May the long time sun shine upon you
All love surround you
And the pure light within you
Guide you all the way on

May the long time sun shine upon you
All love surround you
And the pure light within you
Guide you all the way on

But me I remember your long red hair
Falling in our faces as I kissed you

As I lay here in the six at morning
And in the lonely midnight
I've got to hold your face before me

I just want you to know I just had to grow
And you're probably married now
With kids and all
And you turned into a grown-up female stranger

Who moved the black castle 
Who moved the white queen
When Gimmel and Daleth where standing between?

Out of the evening growing a veil
Pining for the pine woods that ached for the sail
There's something forgotten I want you to know
The freckles of rain are telling me so

O it's the old forgotten question 
What is that we are part of?
What is it that we are?
And an elephant madness has covered the sun

The judge and the juries they play for the fun
They've torn up the roses and washed all the soap
And the martyr who marries them dares not elope
O it's the never realised question

O long O long e're yet my eyes
Braved the gates enormous fire
And the body folded 'round me
And the person in me grew

The flower and its petal
The root and its grasp
The earth and its bigness

The foot and its move
The life and its pattern
The heart and its love

Oh, there is no song before it.
The words and tune are none of my own,
for my joys and sorrows bore it.

Beside the sea
The brambly briars, in the still of evening,
Birds fly out behind the sun,
and with them I'll be leaving.

The fallen leaves that jewel the ground,
They know the art of dying,
And leave with joy their glad gold hearts,
In the scarlet shadows lying.

When hunger calls my footsteps home,
The morning follows after,
I swim the seas within my mind,
And the pine-trees laugh green laughter.

I used to search for happiness,
And I used to follow pleasure,
But I found a door behind my mind,
And that's the greatest treasure.

For rulers like to lay down laws,
And rebels like to break them,
And the poor priests like to walk in chains,
And God likes to forsake them.

I met a man whose name was Time,
And he said, ""I must be going,""
But just how long ago that was,
I have no way of knowing.

Sometimes I want to murder time,
Sometimes when my heart's aching,
But mostly I just stroll along,
The path that he is taking.",October Song

Who among you has not laid his head
Beneath some holy awning
Would think that such a night of tortured travelling

Could bring such a glory morning
And feel his heart sucked to his head
His head so wide that all life says
Has room to live and breathe and have its being - and more

For such a scene of beauty 
For such a scene of beauty 
Encompasses
See the white bird on the water

In beauty calm and still

Of the morning

See he watches the white bird
Of the morning
White bird, white bird, 
Warm in his ecstasy

A shimmering gentle backward fall
He leaves his body there so small and mirror black against the sun
With deities for strength
He sees his body wracked with pain

And hears his voice so stained with sadness deep
It asks the day to weep away
Loved her so strong now
She is gone

Me the games seem so strange
Walk in the light

I shall never
Walk in the light

Oh baby, won't you tell me 'bout your black rose?
And the garden where your love grows
Among the cabbages and beans
Hey, come tell me why your primroses are green
But if you want to tell me some more

The Indians,"Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment, this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of vodka is still lodged in my head
And some blond gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed as I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
It's own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is, baby you're all that I need

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

Well, I'm so far away each step that I take
Is on my way home, a king's ransom in dimes
I'd given each night just to see through this pay phone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
'Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper, baby blind love is true

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked and she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah but I laughed so hard I think I died

When you close your eyes know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me to stand in her spotlight again
Tonight, I won't be alone but you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove for it's you that I'd die to defend

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

The Intention,"You took my kisses and you took my love
You taught me how to care
Am I to be just the remnant of a one-sided love affair?
All you took, I gladly gave
There's nothing left for me to save

All of me why not take all of me
Can't you see I'm no good without you
Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them

How can I go on dear without you

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

Will it fade way out of sight

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

She's a woman in love
And he's gonna break her heart to pieces
She don't want to see
She's a woman in love, but it's not me

Well alright, do what you want
Don't try to talk, don't say nothin'
She used to be the kind of woman
You have and you hold, she could understand the problem
She let the little things go

To keep his thumb jammed in the dam
That holds his dreams in
But that's a secret only Margaret knows

When Amsterdam is golden in the morning
Margaret brings him breakfast
She believes him
He thinks the tulips bloom beneath the snow
He's mad as he can be but Margaret only sees that sometimes
Sometimes she sees her unborn children in his eyes

Let us go to the banks of the ocean
Where the walls rise above the Zuiderzee
Long ago, I used to be a young man
And dear Margaret remembers that for me

The Dutchman still wears wooden shoes
His cap and coat are patched with love
That Margaret sewed in
Sometimes he thinks he's still in Rotterdam
He watches tugboats down canals
And calls out to them when he thinks he knows the Captain
'Til Margaret comes to take him home again
Through unforgiving streets
That trip him though she holds his arm
Sometimes he thinks that he's alone and calls her name

She winds his muffler tighter,
They sit in the kitchen
Some tea with whiskey keeps away the dew
He sees her for a moment, calls her name

She learned it when the tune was very new
He hums a line or two, they hum together in the night

Bound for the boston state

And fished the georges bank

And the wages fare
To the good lord I gave thanks

As good as any man

Id live in my home land

Have you changed since I've been gone
Oh how I long to see you

If I could get just one more chance
To walk your rugged shore

And go to sea no more

last night as I lay dreaming
I sailed the raging foam
My ship she took me far away
To the rocky shores of home

and I could write a thousand lines
To say just how I feel
I hope and pray that some fine day
My dreams they can be real

Left the girls of Tuam, so sad and broken hearted

Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother,

Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghost an goblins,
Bought a pair of brogues, rattlin' over the bugs,

But she never has an eye for me.
Now there's a little girl who's worth her weight in gold.
And that's a decent dowry, don't you see?
And I mean to go and ask her just as soon as I get bold,

To be made a little orangeman, my father's shining star
I was christened David Anthony, but still in spite of that
To my father I was William while my mother called me Pat

Oh it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green

With mother every Sunday to mass I'd proudly stroll
Then after that the orange lads would try to save my soul
For both sides tried to claim me, but I was smart because
I played the flute or played the harp, depending where I was

Oh it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green

One day my ma's relations came round to visit me
Just as my father's kinfolk were all sittin' down to tea
We tried to smooth things over, but they all began to fight
And me being strictly neutral, I bashed everyone in sight

Oh it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green

Now my parents never could agree about my type of school
My learning was all done at home, that's why I'm such a fool
They both passed on, god rest them, but left me caught between
That awful color problem of the orange and the green

Oh it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green

Yes it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green",The Orange and the Green
The Irish Rovers,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone
Till the day draws to an end.
But when the sun goes down
And the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone
I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night, you're so close to me.
All through the night, from a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy.

When dawn comes to waken me
You're never there at all.
I know you've forsaken me,
Till the shadows fall.
But then once again
I can dream,
I've the right
To be close to you
All through the night.",All Through the Night

And we warned her not to go
But she forgot her medication
And she wandered out the door into the snow

At the scene of the attack
There were hoofprints on her forehead
And incriminating claw marks on her back

Could've been the whiskey
It might have been the gin
Could have been the three or four six packs, I don't know
But look at the mess I'm in    
My head is like a football
I think I'm going to die
Tell me, me oh, me oh my
Wasn't that a party

Someone took a grapefruit
Wore it like a hat
I saw someone under my kitchen table   
Talking to my old tom cat              
They were talking about hockey
The cat was talking back
Long about then everything went black
Wasn't that a party  

I'm sure it's just my memory
Playing tricks on me
But I think I saw my buddy
Cutting down my neighbor's tree

Billy Joe and Tommy
Well they went a little far              
They were sitting in the back yard, blowing on a siren
From somebody's police car

So you see, Your Honor
It was all in fun
The little bitty track meet down on main street
Was just to see if the cops could run
Well they run us in to see you
In an alcoholic haze
I sure can use those thirty days
To recover from the party

The Irish Rovers,"A long time ago, when the Earth was green,
There was more kinds of animals than you've ever seen.
And they ran about and played while the Earth was being born,
And the loveliest of all was the unicorn.

There was green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees.
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born,
The loveliest of all was the unicorn.

The Lord seen some sinning and it caused Him pain.
And He said, ""Stand back, I'm going to make it rain!""
He said, ""Hey, Brother Noah, I'll tell you what to do,
Go and build me a floating zoo,""

""And take some""

""Green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees.
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born.
Don't you forget My unicorns.""

Old Noah was there to answer the call,
He finished up the ark just as the rain started to fall.
Then he marched in the animals two by two,
And he called out as they came through,

""Hey Lord,""

""I've got green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees.
Some cats and rats and elephants, but Lord, I'm so forlorn,
I just can't find no unicorns!""

And Noah looked out through the driving rain,
Them unicorns were hiding, playing silly games.
Kicking and splashing while the rain was pourin',
Oh, them silly unicorns!

There was green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees.
Noah cried, ""Close the door because it's starting to storm,
And we just can't wait for those unicorns!""

The ark started moving, it drifted with the tide,
The unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried.
And the waters came down and sort of floated them away,
That's why you never see unicorns to this very day.

You'll see some green alligators and long-necked geese,
Lots of humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees.
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born,
You're never gonna see a unicorn!",The Unicorn [*]

Day after day for thirty years the same routine
The special needs he lives with makes life seem so unfair
But he thanks God every day 'cause he knows mom and dad are there

And he's a hero and she's a hero
It doesn't matter that nobody knows their name
They keep on givin' to make life worth livin'
Might go unnoticed but they're heroes just the same

They tried for many years to have a baby of their own
But God knew a little girl who didn't have a home
Someone else's burden was their blessing in disguise
And now she's got a mom and daddy there to hold her when she cries

And he's a hero and she's a hero
It doesn't matter that nobody knows their name
They keep on givin' to make life worth livin'
Might go unnoticed but they're heroes just the same

Every single parent who must carry twice the load
And those who sacrifice to raise a child that's not their own
They dedicate their time to make a difference in someone else's life
And in my eyes

He's a hero and she's a hero
It doesn't matter that nobody knows their name
They keep on givin' to make life worth livin'
Might go unnoticed but they're heroes just the same
They might go unnoticed but they're heroes

The Isaacs,"I heard about these kids walkin' on a train track
Forty tons of steel bearin' down on them
And they just turned their backs
Channel 5 asked the one who survived
""Son, why'd you do such a thing?""
No reply but his eyes cried

Peace, I just need some peace
If I have to, I'll do anything
Don't need your love or your sympathy
But I cannot go on living without peace

I know a man who sits and stares at kitchen cabinet door
He hides a whiskey bottle he hasn't touched since
Well, this is day four
He told his wife, this time he would try
She was just about to leave
No reply but her eyes cried

Peace, I just need some peace
If I have to, I'll do anything
Don't need your love or your sympathy
But I cannot go on living without peace

I have a friend who's looking for God
A few good self-help books is as far as she's gotten

Say a prayer tonight for that desperate child
Say a prayer tonight for that man and his wife
Say a prayer for the hurtin' searchin' for the one thing we all need
If you don't know what to say
Look up to Heaven's face
And pray peace

The Isaacs,"A helpless man blind from birth
The only one who saw his worth
Didn't pass him by, He heard his cry

He rubbed his eyes with a handful of clay
Then He said, ""Go wash in the pool today""
And the blind man knew that's what he had to do

You know along the way
He couldn't help but trip and fall
Each time he got back up
I wonder if he thought

Every step I take is a step in faith
When I can't see what's in front of me
I'll walk on and just believe
He hears my prayer

Is waiting in the water

Just like that blind man sometimes
I've felt all alone, like all hope was gone

And no matter what I'm going through
He promised me that He would never leave

I didn't wanna give a second chance

That's just half the fun, oh boy 
Seeking satisfaction 
Keeps me on the run 
I can't play my music 
They say my music's too loud 
I kept talkin about it 
I got the big run around 
When I rolled with the punches 
I got knocked on the ground

The Isley Brothers,"I was once out strolling,
One hot summer day.
When I thought I'd lay,
Myself down to rest.

In a big field,
Of tall grass,
I lay there in the sun and I,
Felt it caressin' my face.

As I fell asleep,
I dreamed that I was in a Hollywood movie,
And that I was the star,
Of the movie.

This really blew my mind,
But there I was,
Oh yeah I was.
I was taken to the place,
The hall of the mountain king.

I stood high upon the mountaintop,
Naked to the world.
In front of me,
Was every kind of girl.

There was long ones, tall ones,
Short ones, brown ones,
Black ones, round ones,
Big crazy ones.

Out of the middle,
Came a lady.
She whispered in my ear,
Somethin' crazy...

[Chorus]
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.
Spill the wine, take that pearl.

I thought to myself,
What could this mean?
Am I going crazy,
Or is it just a dream?

Now wait a minute...

I know I'm lying,
In a field of grass somewhere.
It was all in my head.
But then I heard,
Somebody say...

[Chorus]

I could feel hot flames,
Of fire roaring at my back,
As she disappeared.
But soon she returned.

In her hand was a bottle of wine,
And in the other, a glass,
Good god.

She poured some of that wine,
From the bottle into the glass.
And she raised it to her lip,
And before she drank it, she said...

[Chorus]

Spill, spill, spill that wine.
Come on, take that pearl.
Come on and spill that wine.
Come on and take that pearl.

Spill that wine!

[Chorus]

Spill, spill, spill...
Spill, spill, spill that wine.
Come on and spill that wine.
Come on, take that pearl.
Come on and spill that wine.

The Isley Brothers,"Seize upon that moment long ago
One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see
That place in time...so gold
Steal away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever...and be in time
Stay gold
But can it be
When we can see
So vividly
A memory
And yes you say
So must the day
Too, fade away
And leave a ray of sun
So gold
Life is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
though not imagined
All things that happen
Will age too old
Though gold",Stay Gold

And then I turned the TV down

What I saw was enough to drive a Preacher wild
I'm in the hall contemplatin' ""not in my own damn house"".
Who would have thought she was creepin' wit another man?
The down low happenin' to me all over again
And then I turned the TV down
Cause I know I heard a squicky sound,
Something going on upstairs cause I know no one else lives here

The Isley Brothers,"Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night was at this real wild party
There was liquor overflowin' the cup,
About 5 or 6 strippers trying to work for a buck.
So I took one girl outside with me,
Her name was Londy, she went to Junior High with me,
I said, ""Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said,

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

Girl, you ain't the only one to have a baby,
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
So she stared me right square in the eye
And said, ""Everyday I wake up, hoping to die""
She said, ""They're gonna know about pain
'Cause me and my sister ran away,
So our daddy couldn't rape us,
Before I was a teenager
I done been through more shit
You can't even relate to""

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet!

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to

I could not speak a word
My tongue was tied in giant knots
And I felt so disturbed

At the feeling rushing through me
The heat inside my veins
At the way my nerve ends tingle
Every time you call my name

I've got a lust ignited fever
And I can't put out the flame

Next time that I saw you

You had a languid disposition
I had an willingness to please

Full of violets and sex
Had me harder than a coal train
Had my collar wringing wet

A masterpiece of grace
And animated work of art
Who's acquired a taste

Lie down on their backs
To be ridden at your leisure
And be taken off like hats

I'm not here for you to walk on
And I'm not your welcome mat

Celebrate your lives, give thanks for your children
Gather everyone, gather all together

When I come home from a hard days work
And you're waiting there, not a care in the world

See the smile a-waiting in the kitchen
Food cooking and the plates for two
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through

The Iveys,"'Tween the darkness and the light
As the stars fade out of sight
I can hear his shiny boots fall on the sand
With a basket at his side and the morning full of pride
You can see him cast his line with skillful hands

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, fisherman
I wish you luck, that's all I can
Hey, hey, fisherman

Forget the world if that's your plan
As the morning turns to noon
He's content to sit and croon
And he lights his twisted pipe and settles down
Onward goes the time as he tries new baited line
So he digs another worm up from the ground

[Chorus]

'Tween the nightness and the light
The line is taut, he has a bite
And he hauls the beauty in with skillful pride
And his patient mind is blown
'Cause the fish is overgrown
It was really worth the day for such a prize

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,
So let's get together.

She's my sunshine at the end of a perfect day.

That day when you set me upon your knee 
You said the only the right girl could be all these things,

Mama, I think I found that girl; 
Well mama, I think I found that girl.

She said, ""Son, go on and search around, 
There's a good girl who's out there to be found."" and

Well, mama I think I found that girl.

'Cause every night I have the strangest dreams
Imprisoned by the way it could have been
Left here on my own or so it seems
I've got to leave before I start to scream
Someone locked the door and turned the key

Feeling alright
I'm not feeling good myself
Feeling alright
I don't have to feel alright
I'm feeling good myself
Boy you sure took me for a ride
And even now I sit and wonder why
That when I think of you I stop myself from crying
I just can't waste my time
I must keep trying

I've got to stop believing all your lies
'Cause there's to much to do before I die

Don't you get to lost in all I say
But at the time you know
I really felt that way
But that was then and now you know its today

Till someone comes along to take my place
With a different name and a different face

A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms.
Then suddenly, oo, your lips are touching mine.
A feeling so divine 'til I leave the past behind.
I'm lost in a world made for you and me.
Oo love me.

Whispering how much you care,

We were always hand in hand
I was hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her""
Yah! Hey, hey, hey

Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her

'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere

When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, know, know, know, know,
I know, I know,
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone

Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone

The Jackson 5,"Ben, the two of us need look no more,
We both found what we were looking for.

I'll never be alone, and you, my friend, will see,
You've got a friend in me.
Ben, you're always running here and there,
You feel you're not wanted anywhere.
If you ever look behind and don't like what you find
There's something you should know, you've got a place to go.
I used to say I and me, now it's us, now it's we.
I used to say I and me, now it's us, now it's we.
Ben most people would turn you away;
I don't listen to a word they say.
They don't see you as I do;
I wish they would try to'

And Mama, they talk all around town say that 
Papa had three outside children and another wife

Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death
And stealin' in the name of the Lord

Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin';
Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just hung her head and said, ""Son,
Papa was a rollin' stone.

If this is luck then let it ride
If it's the stars

I've never been so satisfied
By love before

That my time had come to win a hand

n the last row in the balcony?
 
There's Technicolor and Cinemascope, 
A cast out a Holly wood, 
And the popcorn from the candy store, 
Makes it all seem twice as good. 
There's alway lots of pretty girls 
With figures they don't try to hide,
But they never can compare  
To the girl sittin' by my side.

Who cares what picture you see 
when you're huggin' with your baby

And just as dark as before, 
And Saturday night when you're with your baby,
Who could ask for anything more?

Watch it count down to the end of the day

What it meant to me

Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me

Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
'Cause although you're gone
I keep holding on
To the happy times
Oh, when you were mine

As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust

After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of loving you

I promised I would never ever be returning

Staring, glaring, tearing through me 
Someone said welcome to your doom 
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me

To hurt me

He`s been here in tears for fifteen years

And found that wicked women run this strange hotel

But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away

Their dream of life they won't never find

The Jam,"Times were so tough, but not as tough as they are now
We were so close and nothing came between us, and the world
No personal situations
Thick as thieves us, we'd stick together for all time
And we meant it but it turns out just for a while
We stole, the friendship that bound us together

We stole from the schools and their libraries
We stole from the drugs that sent us to sleep
We stole from the drink that made us sick
We stole anything that we couldn't keep
And it was enough, we didn't have to spoil anything
And always be as thick as thieves

Like a perfect stranger, you came into my life
Then like the perfect lone ranger, you rode away, rode away
Rode away, rode away

We stole the love from young girls in ivory towers
We stole autumn leaves and summer showers
We stole the silent wind that says you are free
We stole everything that we could see
But it wasn't enough, and now we've gone and spoiled everything
Now we're no longer as thick as thieves

You came into my life
Then like a perfect stranger you walked away, walked away
Walked away, walked away

Thick as thieves us, we'd stick together for all time
And we meant it but it turns out just for awhile
We stole the friendship that bound us together

We stole the burning sun in the open sky
We stole the twinkling stars in the black night
We stole the green belt fields that made us believe
We stole everything that we could see

But something came along that changes our minds (we're no longer thick as thieves)
I don't know what and I don't know why (we're not thick as we used to be)
But we seemed to grow up in a flash of time (we're no longer thick as thieves)
While we watched our ideals helplessly unwind (we're not thick as we used to be)

No, we're no longer as thick as thieves, no
We're not as thick as we used to be, no
We're no longer as thick as thieves, no
We're not as thick as we used to be

Lonely as the moors on a winter's morning
Quiet as the sea on a good calm night
In your tranquil shadow, I try and follow

I hear your distant shoe clicks, to the midnight beat
I feel trapped in sorrow, in this imagery
But that's how I am and why I need you so

But I don't mean to bleed you dry
Or take you over for the rest of your life
It's just that I need something solid in mine

Where we ran when we were young
This is a tale from the water meadows

That open space, you could run for miles
Now you don't get so many to the pound

True, it's a dream mixed with nostalgia
But it's a dream that I'll always hang on to, that I'll always run to
Won't you join me by the riverbank?

Paradise found down by the still waters
Joined in the race to the rainbow's end
No fears, no worries just a golden country
Woke at sunrise, went home at sunset

Now life is so critical, life is too cynical
We lose our innocence, we lose our very soul

True, it's a dream mixed with nostalgia
But it's a dream that I'll always hang on to, that I'll always run to

Opening the windows and breathing in petrol

Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume
A hot summer's day and sticky black tarmac
Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were far away

To a closet ghost, a picture of your fantasy,
A victim of your misery, and private hell

Drink lots of beer and wait for half time results
Afternoon tea in the light-a-bite - chat up the girls

Wear cheap perfume 'cause its all they can afford
Go to discos they drink Babycham talk to Jan - in bingo accents

Saturdays kids play one arm bandits
They never win but that's not the point is it
Dip in silver paper when their pints go flat
How about that - far out!

Their mums and dads smoke Capstan non filters
Wallpaper lives 'cause they all die of cancer

Or a big film star, yes I think I would like that

They really dig me and I dig them
And the bread I spend, is like my fame, it's quickly diminished

And there's no more swimming in a guitar shaped pool
No more reporters at my beck and call
No more cocaine it's only ground chalk
No more taxis now we'll have to walk

But didn't we have a nice time,
Didn't we have a nice time
Oh wasn't it such a fine time

I realize I should have stuck to my guns
Instead shit out to be one of the bastard sons
And lose myself, I know it was wrong, but it's cost me a lot

I'm out on me ass with the rest of the clowns

The Jam,"Meet me on the wastelands - later this day
We'll sit and talk and hold hands maybe
For there's not much else to do in this drab and colorless place
We'll sit amongst the rubber tires
Amongst the discarded bric-a-brac
People have no use for - amongst the smoldering embers of yesterday

And when or if the sun shines
Lighting our once beautiful features
We'll smile but only for seconds
For to be caught smiling is to acknowledge life
A brave but useless show of compassion
And that is forbidden in this drab and colorless world

Meet me on the wastelands - the ones behind
The old houses - the ones - left standing pre-war 
The ones overshadowed by the monolith monstrosities 
Councils call homes

And there amongst the shit - the dirty linen
The holy Coca-Cola tins - the punctured footballs
The ragged dolls - the rusting bicycles
We'll sit and probably hold hands

And watch the rain fall - watch it - watch it 
Tumble and fall - tumble and falling
Like our lives - like our lives 
Just like our lives

We'll talk about the old days
When the wasteland was release when we could play
And think - without feeling guilty 
Meet me later but we'll have to hold hands

The Jam,"The distant echo
Of faraway voices boarding faraway trains
To take them home to
The ones that they love and who love them forever
The glazed, dirty steps, repeat my own and reflect my thoughts
Cold and uninviting, partially naked
Except for toffee wrappers and this morning's paper
Mr. Jones got run down
Headlines of death and sorrow, they tell of tomorrow
Madmen on the rampage
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I fumble for change, and pull out the Queen
Smiling, beguiling
I put in the money and pull out a plum
Behind me
Whispers in the shadows, gruff blazing voices
Hating, waiting
""Hey boy"" they shout, ""have you got any money?""
And I said, ""I've a little money and a takeaway curry
I'm on my way home to my wife
She'll be lining up the cutlery, you know she's expecting me
Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork""
I'm down in the tube station at midnight

I first felt a fist, and then a kick
I could now smell their breath
They smelt of pubs and wormwood scrubs
And too many right wing meetings
My life swam around me
It took a look and drowned me in its own existence
The smell of brown leather
It blended in with the weather
Filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth, it blocked all my senses
Couldn't see, hear, speak any longer
I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I said I was down in the tube station at midnight

The last thing that I saw as I lay there on the floor
Was ""Jesus saves"" painted by an atheist nutter
And a British rail poster read ""have an away day, a cheap holiday
Do it today""
I glanced back on my life, and thought about my wife
'Cause they took the keys, and she'll think it's me
I'm down in the tube station at midnight
The wine will be flat and the curry's gone cold
I'm down in the tube station at midnight
Don't want to go down in a tube station at midnight
Don't want to go down in a tube station at midnight

Of faraway voices boarding faraway trains
To take them home to
The ones that they love and who love them forever
The glazed, dirty steps, repeat my own and reflect my thoughts
Cold and uninviting, partially naked
Except for toffee wrappers and this morning's paper
Mr. Jones got run down
Headlines of death and sorrow, they tell of tomorrow
Madmen on the rampage
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I fumble for change, and pull out the Queen
Smiling, beguiling
I put in the money and pull out a plum
Behind me
Whispers in the shadows, gruff blazing voices
Hating, waiting
""Hey boy"" they shout, ""have you got any money?""
And I said, ""I've a little money and a takeaway curry
I'm on my way home to my wife
She'll be lining up the cutlery, you know she's expecting me
Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork""
I'm down in the tube station at midnight

I first felt a fist, and then a kick
I could now smell their breath
They smelt of pubs and wormwood scrubs
And too many right wing meetings
My life swam around me
It took a look and drowned me in its own existence
The smell of brown leather
It blended in with the weather
Filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth, it blocked all my senses
Couldn't see, hear, speak any longer
I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I said I was down in the tube station at midnight

The last thing that I saw as I lay there on the floor
Was ""Jesus saves"" painted by an atheist nutter
And a British rail poster read ""have an away day, a cheap holiday
Do it today""
I glanced back on my life, and thought about my wife
'Cause they took the keys, and she'll think it's me
I'm down in the tube station at midnight
The wine will be flat and the curry's gone cold
I'm down in the tube station at midnight

All that rugby puts hairs on your chest
What chance have you got against a tie and a crest?

Hello-hurrah, I hope rain stops play, with the Eton rifles

Thought you were clever when you lit the fuse
Tore down the house of commons in your brand new shoes
Compose a revolutionary symphony
Then went to bed with a charming young thing

Hello-hurrah, cheers then mate, its the Eton rifles
Hello-hurrah, an extremist scrape, with the Eton rifles

What a catalyst you turned out to be
Loaded the guns then you run off home for your tea
Left me standing, like a guilty (naughty) schoolboy

We came out of it naturally the worst
Beaten and bloody and I was sick down my shirt
We were no match for their untamed wit
Though some of the lads said they'll be back next week

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone

'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""

And I'm still not sure, I want to change mine

Though I've only been here for three weeks now
I've got blisters on my feet
Trying to find a friend in Oxford Street
I bought an A to Z guide book
Trying to find the clubs and YMCAs
But when you ask in a strange town
They say don't know, don't care and I've got to go, mate

They worry themselves about feeling low
They worry themselves about the dreadful snow
They all ignore me 'cause they don't know
I'm really a spaceman from those UFOs

You've got to move in a straight line
You've got to walk and talk in four-four time
You can't be weird in a strange town
You'll be betrayed by your accent and manners

You've got to wear the right clothes
Be careful not to pick or scratch your nose
You can't be nice in a strange town
'Cause we don't know, don't care and we got to go, man

Rush my money to the record shops
I stop off in a back street buy myself a snort
We got our own manifesto, be kind to queers
And I'm so glad the revolution's here
It's nice and warm now!

I've finished with clubs where the music's loud
'Cause I don't see a face in a single crowd
There's no one there
I look in the mirror, but I can't be seen
Just a thin, clean layer of mister sheen looking back at me
Oh, oh

Found myself in a strange town
Though I've only been here for three weeks now
I've got blisters on my feet
Trying to find a friend in Oxford Street

I bought an A to Z guide book
Trying to find the clubs and YMCAs
When you ask in a strange town
They say don't know, don't care and I've got to go, mate

The Jam,"Tonight at noon, tonight at noon
When we meet in the midnight hour,
I will bring you night flowers (coloured)
Like your eyes
Tonight at noon, I'll touch your hand
Held for a moment amongst strangers
Amongst the dripping trees
Country girl
Walking in city squares in winter rain
Walking down muddy lanes or empty streets
Arranging a time and place to meet
Tonight at noon, you'll feel my warmth
You'll feel my body inside you
We'll be together for hours
Time and tears
Won't wait for evermore

The Jam,"Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Life is timeless, days are long when you're young
You used to fall in love with everyone
Any guitar and any bass drum
Life is a drink and you get drunk when you're young
Life is new and there's things to be done
You can't wait to be grown up
Acceptance into the capital world
You pull on some weed, then you pull on someone when you're young

But you find out life isn't like that
It's so hard to comprehend
Why you set up your dreams to have them smashed in the end

But you don't mind you've got time on your side
And they're never gonna make you stand in line
You're just waiting for the right time

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
You're fearless and brave, you can't be stopped when you're young
You swear you're never-ever gonna work for someone
No corporations for the new-age sons
Tears of rage roll down your face
But still you say it's fun

And you find out life isn't like that
It's so hard to understand
Why the world is your oyster but your future's a clam

It's got you in its grip before you're born
It's done with the use of a dice and a board
They let you think you're king but you're really a pawn

Whoa-oh, whoa-oa
Whoa-oh

You're fearless and brave, you can't be stopped when you're young
You used to fall in love with everyone

The Jam,"So you finally got what you wanted
You've achieved your aim by making me walk in line
And when you just can't get any higher
You use your senses to suss out this week's climber
And the small fame that you've acquired
Has brought you into cult status
But to me you're still a collector

There's tarts and whores but you're much more
You're a different kind 'cause you want their minds
And you just don't care 'cause you've got no pride
It's just a face on your pillowcase
That thrills you

And you started looking much older
And your fashion sense is second-rate like your perfume
But to you in your little dream world
You're still the queen of the butterfly collectors

As you carry on 'cause it's all you know
You can't light a fire, you can't cook or sew
You get from day to day by filling your head
But surely you must know the appeal between your legs
Has worn off

And I don't care about morals
'Cause the world's insane and we're all to blame anyway
And I don't feel any sorrow
Towards the kings and queens of the butterfly collectors

The Jam,"In echoed steps I walked across an empty dream
I looked across this world, there's no one to be seen
This empty feeling turned and quietly walked away
I saw no warmth in life, no love was in my eyes

I stared a century, thinking this will never change
As I hesitated, time rushed onwards without me
Too scared to break the spell, too small to take a fall
But the absolute luck is, love is in our hearts

But look around this world, there's millions to be seen
Come see the tyrants panic, see their crumbling empires fall

Who together at tables sit and drink beer

Opening the windows and breathing in petrol,

Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume,
A hot summers' day and sticky black tarmac,
Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were faraway

Two lovers missing the tranquility of solitude,
Getting a cab and traveling on buses,

Beat up Camaro, that smile on his face
In my driveway, class will have to wait
Let's take a drive
Zero to sixty down Innocence Road
He was taking my heart 'bout as fast as it would go
What a big show, how was I to know at the time?

Seventeen, he was my everything
My first kiss, first touch, first love to remember
And he played the part knowing I'd fall so hard
I was young enough to know how to surrender
And he was old enough to be a pretender

Whispered ""I love you's"" don't mean much
When you open up your eyes and
Find you're not the only one who's felt his touch
His memories cut so deep they keep reminding me of

Seventeen, he was my everything
My first kiss, first touch, first love to remember
And he played the part knowing I'd fall so hard
I was young enough to know how to surrender
And he was old enough to be a pretender

If I had to do it over
There's no chance that I would ever
Let his perfect smile pull me in
If I knew that he was just pretending

Seventeen, he was my everything

He played the part knowing I'd fall so hard
I was young enough to know how to surrender
And he was old enough to be a pretender

How could I aim so wrong

I can't stop those flashing reds
The strange, the strangest love
The strangest love I ever had

You said I hold the door right
You said I've gone this far
You've been watching over
The dreams that kept us from
What's real well they seem
So foolish now
How can I live without you
How can I make it through
I was on the floor
When I ran you out my door

They only found a note
Take the past nine years
Back from where they came
People call that suicide
But I see him on the street today
He kept his winter coat
It's cold outside in April
All this time away
From his wife's soft bed
Would it help to say I understand
Why I see him on the street today
He left it all the same
They say this boy is yours

A path for my feet
When I was around you
What's found is yours to keep

Say that I'm your one and only
This love I have for you
I must have watched from your garden
Oh, say you're home to stay

You've gone and let someone turn your pretty name around
You've gone and let someone turn your pretty name around
You've gone and let someone turn your pretty name around

Many times that I wondered
I was right for me to do
Stand out on my corner
Hoping my sweets will lead to you

Just inside of your glory
Like the time and time before
Never meant to beg or borrow
Sleep outside your hidden door

You've gone and let someone turn your pretty name around
You've gone and let someone turn your pretty name around
You've gone and let someone turn your pretty name around

When we put our arms 'round each other
It's not hard to tell
That you're loving someone else

You've gone and let someone turn your pretty name around
You've gone and let someone turn your pretty name around
You've gone and let someone turn your pretty name around
You've gone and let someone turn your pretty name around

It's a disaster in the making
Take the time to smell the leaves beneath the trees

I'm just a blade bending in your shade
For your love I'm a vampire

Headed up to Pittsburgh
Heard you could get a pretty good sandwich
For fifteen and a dime
I miss that old stretch of road
Down to the Bayou
In the middle of the night

The mere smell of speculation conjures up hell
Feel the touch of oil from the tankers upon the breeze

Hide behind the cottails of your father
I've been alone so long I thought I'd never last
Stuck up on a shelf like an old dusty hat

But then you came along
You put me on that throne
Up into the sky
Thought I saw Nick Cave down at the laundromat

You put your hand in my hand and that was that
Your perfume on my sleeve
You lit my life like a Christmas tree
Up into the sky

While the maids vacuum the hall outside my cheap hotel room
Then the shit came down

They represent the souls of those like you and me

And smile when you're down and out
(Find something inside you)
Smile when you're down and out
(Find something inside you)
Smile

(Chin up, chin up)
You don't really have a problem
(Chin up, chin up)
In your hour of despair

And smile when you're down and out
(Find something inside you)
Smile when you're down and out
(Find something inside you)",Smile
The Jayhawks,"Scarface, you were out of place in Ohio
Too bad, you were up ahead out in the snow
You were feeling like a bomb without a target
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa

Look out Joe I think the sky is fallin'
Seems that all the clouds have turned to stone
I'm calling you from somewhere deep in Ohio
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa

Skintight, you were up all night in the shower
So tough, you were breaking up over the wire
Well I saw you heading up a muddy river
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa

Look out Joe I think the sky is fallin'
Seems that all the clouds have turned to stone
I see the flashing lights along the highway, ohoh
You sounded lost and desperate on the phone.

Look out Joe I think the sky is fallin'
Seems that all the clouds have turned to stone
I'm calling from somewhere deep in Ohio

The Jayhawks,"What led me to this town 
Room to roam but no place called home 
Dazed at first but shaking off the Sunday gloom 
What led me to this town 

Such a lazy afternoon 
Eight shades of gray and I can taste the rain 
Oh, how high the lovely have flown 
What led me to this town 

Blue lights shining over my life 
Blue lights shining over my life 
Blue lights shining over my life 
Blue lights shining over me 

Sometimes I can't get free 
When you're standing right there in front of me 
I woke up one day and my dreams were gone 
What led me to this town 

Blue lights shining over my life 
Blue lights shining over my life 
Blue lights shining over my life 
Blue lights shining over me 

What led me to this town 
Are you keeping a secret 
Well, I'm keeping one too 
Can you keep it a secret 
I'm in love with you 

What happened to this boy 
Such a lovely mother's son 

Blue lights shining over my life",What Led Me to This Town
The Jayhawks,"As I lay upon my bed, I begin dreaming
Of how it's gonna be the day that I am free
Once I settle like the dust upon the table
But then you came along
You helped me write this song

I don't know what day it is,
I can't recall the seasons
And I don't remember how we got this far
All I know is I'm loving you for all the right reasons
In my sky you'll always be my morning star

Like a tired bird flying high across the ocean
I was outside looking in
You made me live again
From the mountains to the prairies little babies
Figures fill their heads
Visions bathed in red

I don't know what day it is,
I can't recall the seasons
And I don't remember how we got this far
All I know is I'm loving you for all the right reasons
In my sky you'll always be my morning star

From the train in Manchester, England
Lightning fills the sky
As I watched you wave goodbye
From the mountains to the prairie little babies
Figures fill their heads
Visions bathed in red

I don't know what day it is,
I can't recall the seasons
And I don't remember how we got this far
All I know is I'm loving you for all the right reasons
In my sky you'll always be my morning star",All the Right Reasons
The Jayhawks,"Here comes the weather
It's looking like another storm
If all desire
Would leave this tired boy alone

Hopes haunt me like ghosts
They point their fingers
Grass grows in the cracks
Wind makes me shiver

Angelyne, forgive me
We threw it all away
You could never stand living with a man
Who could only lead you half way to love

I tried to fake it
But you wouldn't play along
I watched you naked
Innocent and holding on

Snowflakes make your bones ache in the winter
Your face will not fade, it will just linger

Angelyne, forgive me
We threw it all away
You could never stand living with a man
Who could only lead you half way
Angelyne, forgive me
We threw it all away
I could never fit into your plans
I'm nobody's man

Don't you tell me how to live my life
Don't you tell me how to live my life

Angelyne, forgive me
We threw it all away
You could never stand living with a man
Who could only lead you half way
Angelyne, forgive me
We threw it all away
I could never fit into your plans
I'm nobody's man",Angelyne
The Jayhawks,"My harp is tuned to the mourning wind
My flute to the voice that weeps within
And I taught the widows' hearts to sing
You're such a nasty little girl

If you wanna taste the water
Gotta come to the river
If you wanna taste the water
Gotta drown, drown, drown

Turned back, had a fall from grace
Now we find each other face to face
The wells you drank from all ran dry
Now you are standing all alone

If you wanna taste the water
Gotta come to the river
If you wanna taste the water
Gotta come to the river

I hope this letter finds you well
You're such a nasty little girl

If you wanna taste the water
Gotta come to the river
If you wanna taste the water
Gotta come to the river

My harp is tuned to the mourning wind
My flute to the voice that weeps within

If you wanna taste the water
Gotta come to the river
If you wanna taste the water
Gotta come to the river
If you wanna taste the water
Gotta come to the river
If you wanna taste the water
Gotta drown, drown, drown",Come to the River
