Tarkan,"Yillar yili gÃ¼lmedi yÃ¼zÃ¼m.
Buralara dogmadi gÃ¼nes

Anladim yalan dÃ¼nya mali
Yalniz edmedim

Tarkan,"Ah! Bir bilse,
Ne adaklar adadim askina,
Soldu renklerim, eskidim ugruna,
Gökyüzüne yazdim adini binlerce yildizla
Aldirmadi, gülüp gecti cagrima

Göze aldim, daglari deldim
Cölleri, denizleri astim geldim
Ah nafile, bakmadi göz yasima.

Ay! Ay kahroldum.
Düse kalka pesinde maskara oldum.
Ay! Ay unutuldum.
Karda kista kurda kusa yem oldum.

Olmadı, tutunamadım
Zor! Yokluğun çok zor

There is nowere to touch that doesn't hurt 
There is nowere that I can't look that isn't blurred 
Wirh all the righteousness and all the holy words...ooo

When the heart sinks lower 
And the healing slower

A thread of peace and a send of hope 
I will raise my eyes to see more 
Speak a truth and we shall know...ooo 

In the light of one choice 
We will sing with one voice

And deciding in which room we're gonna play 
Now you're ready for senses overload 
And all our clothes lay scattered on the floor 
Something's gotta give but no one's gonna leave 
Cause your body is just about to explode 

I'm gonna make you feel good 
Get with the freaky mood I'm in 
Baby you don't have to do a thing 
I'm gonna make you feel good 
Spinning around inside your brain 
Like a sexy kind of hurricane 

I'm the love that you get high on 
I wrote a script with you in mind 
Pull the shades let's do it with the lights on 
Show me what you've got tonight

Tarnation,"Down the road sits the Big O Motel,
Where people tell lies in their own private cell.
With cast down eyes and a packaged surprise,
I come and I go we plan it just so.
At the Big O Motel, on the vibrating bed,
Cologne drenched curtains of velour red.
In the smoky glass mirror I look at my face,
But, on the bed beside me someone has taken your place.
By the Big O mOtel, there's a drive through bar,
They'll make you a daiquiri in a mason jar.
The man at the window with the receding hair line,
Looks away from me but says "" same place, same time "".
At the Big O Motel, on the vibrating bed,
Cologne drenched curtains of velour red.
In the smoky glass mirror I look at my face,
But, on the bed beside me someone has taken your place.
The man on the corner with sausage shaped fingers,
After he's gone, his cigar smoke lingers.
After he's gone I take a shower,
I watch the clock's hands passing the hours.
",Big O Motel
Tarnation,"Do you fancy me, or am I living in make believe?
Am I someone just to pass your time?
To pass lonely hours 'til your heart can be free,
Then you'll forget all about me
Do you think of me,
Or are you a victim of old memories?
Why can't we live for now?
The past is only a sad tragic dream,
Why can't you give your love to me?
Like flowers of springtime there comes a time, when they must wilt away.
Like coldness of winter, with clouds in the sky,
I watch lonely people pass by.
I'll no longer pine for you,
My heart is through with being blue.
Soon you'll turn to find me gone.
Then you'll pass lonely hours,
'Til your heart can be free,
And you'll do all your yearnin' for me.

Places I should go,
I don't even know about

Blow or why

Thank God I'm saved

One thing that I have
Learned, things come
And things they go
Something else I've learned,
That nothing is for sure
I've come through 
Disappointments, many a 
Care and woe
But when everything seems
To crumble all around me,
I stand on one thing 
That's for sure, that 
I'm saved, I am saved,
Thank God I am saved

When the sky cracks 
I'll be going back, 
I'm saved, I'm saved

Tarralyn Ramsey,"VERSE
Been in love so many 
Times before
Everyone I loved walked 
Right out the door
But I never knew that I'd
Find somone like you

Take me by the hand
And help me to stand
I never knew that 
I'd find someone

CHORUS

Give me unconditional love
Give me unconditional love
Give me unconditional love
Give me unconditional love

Love me right
Hold me tight
Lord I love you
Lord I love you

Tarralyn Ramsey,"What it is, had me deep inside
Said he got caught up this one night
Didn't wanna know his reasons why
Too tired to even fight

Said goodbye and I closed the door
Thought I wouldn't love again no more
Then one day, there you were
Here to take away the hurt

No more lonely days, baby, you're the best
Took away the stress, I can't take it now
It?s a brighter day since you came my way
What you do to me, baby, can't get enough

Baby, you'll be my cure from pain
You'll be my sun in the rain
I'm fallin? in love, I can't get enough
'Cause you'll be my remedy

you'll be my cure from the pain
Even my sun in the rain
I'm fallin? in love, I can't get enough
'Cause you'll be my remedy

Doctor, doctor can you make a house call?
Do what you do, make my heart fall
Felt like I never been loved at all
Never been kissed till you came along

Whatever?s wrong you can make it right
Shoulda found you first, wasted so much time
Gave me your heart, so I gave you mine
Told me everything will be alright

No more lonely days, baby, you're the best
Took away the stress, I can't take it now
It?s a brighter day since you came my way
What you do to me, baby, can't get enough

Baby, you'll be my cure from pain
You'll be my sun in the rain
I'm fallin? in love, I can't get enough
'Cause you'll be my remedy

you'll be my cure from the pain
Even my sun in the rain
I'm fallin? in love, I can't get enough
'Cause you'll be my remedy

So glad you found me and put your arms 'round me babe
Much too much wasted time being some place I didn't need to be
No, no, no, but dem days gone away, baby I was so bad I say
I wanna tell the world just how you came
And changed my life with what you mean to me

Baby, you'll be my cure from pain
You'll be my sun in the rain
I'm fallin? in love, I can't get enough
'Cause you'll be my remedy

you'll be my cure from the pain
Even my sun in the rain
I'm fallin? in love, I can't get enough
'Cause you'll be my remedy

you'll be my cure from pain
You'll be my sun in the rain
I'm fallin? in love, I can't get enough

Tarralyn Ramsey,"Our love, the only thing that's true
Has stood the test of time
They said we would never last
But we followed our hearts and let God direct the path

Up against all odds, we were standing up against all odds
Trusting and believing in the miracles of love
Even if it seems to be so hard to reach for the dream that is so far
Never lose your faith in love when you're up against all odds

Life can take you through rough times
But still you will pull through
Hold on to your hopes and dreams
And there's nothing that you can not do, whoa

Up against all odds, we were standing up against all odds
Trusting and believing in the miracles of love
Even if it seems to be so hard to reach for the dream that is so far
Never lose your faith in love when you're up against all odds

Oh, dreams come, dreams go
Only if you don't believe
If we ever stopped to think that we could come so far
Through it all we will go on

Up against all odds, we were standing up against all odds
Trusting and believing in miracles of love
Even if it seems to be so hard to reach for the dream that is so far

Born to be the livest nigga, so you know it's soul survivin'
On the mic, I move the crowd like Big Pun stage divin'

I pull 'em three at once, that's why I said it wit a plural
I'm like Earl the Pearl, straight pimp referral
Y'all niggas can't win, it's like you sword fightin' Zorro

Y'all bummy muthafuckers can't pull my card
I smack the fuck out y'all niggas while I'm tryin' to be hard
But like my nigga at the Grammy's, CaTash is for the children
My style be standin' out like gang writing on a building

I build an' destroy ya, destroy your employer
If y'all niggas ain't on Loud, they wasn't doin' nuttin' for ya
Pot lit the wick to the dynamite stick
So when it blow up in your grill, watch how ugly it get

Even though I'm rockin' solo, I'ma always be a Alki

I'm the Million Dollar Man, you better get this while you can
I been in this fo' a minute, CaTash be winnin' pennants
Every time I grab the mic, it's like I'm speakin' to the Senate

But I'm not a politician, more like a rap magician
Presto chango, Bermuda Triangle
Pull a album outta hat, CaTashTraphe'll fire circuit

I seen y'all dancin' 'cross the street an' y'all was both off beat

So I'ma end it wit a blaa an' jet immediately after
Can't kick wit y'all niggas, y'all might be the Gay Rapper

In the function in conjunction wit my nigga on production

You better recognize, nigga, we on the same boat
We be both be gettin' loc'd when we off that smoky smoke
Hit you wit the okey-doke, you better do the Hokey Poke
An' turn yourself around before I gotta choke some folks

I never go for broke, I break it down for major wage
I be rappin' wit a gauge, Likwit Crew'll flip your page

",Fallin' On
Tash,"[Tash]
Mm.. sing that shit for daddy baby
Pump this motherfucker up.. richochet, ricochet
RICHOCHET (ricochet, ricochet)
RICHOCHET (yo homies, one two yo)

Mmm..
My style is too cold for words, it's like a bullet gone stray
Ease off, I'm bout to speak and hit the wall and ricochet
I rock the Cali way (for sure) I'm only in it to score
Niggaz say I'm owed one, but it's more like four
Hardcore entrepreneur, strainin like a champ
Rollin out in sixty-three's, that hop without a ramp
Young Tash Vamp'll kick your door in while you're snorin;
now where's that salt you was pourin?
I send the bullet soarin, yo ayy, let you slide?  No way
If you a -- ""Why do niggaz shoot?"" -- (""Alright, okay"" - Mos Def)
I gotta buck you down for that shit you was poppin
Now look how rotten the whole situation's gotten
Tash showed you love you shoulda showed me some back
If they catch me they gon' stretch me like Geronimo Pratt
Cause I gotta lay you flat no matter what you say
Homey thought he got away til he caught the ricochet

	Richochet..
""Called the cops, said they heard mad shots"" -> Notorious B.I.G.
	""Take that motherfuckers!"" -> Ice Cube
	Richochet, ricochet..

[Tash]
I tried to warn you killer, my rap style'll have you sprung
like a girl gave you head with a earring in her tongue
Since Tash come from less than zero, my splurgin's urgent
My mouth so foul, you couldn't wash it with detergent
My Likwit niggaz swervin, mergin, like a rally
Rearrangin niggaz grills like the '99 Denali
	Where the fuck we at Cali?  --  You motherfuckin right!
I want to see some action, burn somethin or fight
cause see it's Tash night tonight, it's Tash night tomorrow
I'm lookin for the hoes that got some sex I could borrow
I'll gladly pay you back next Wednesday the 3rd
(Why you laughin at me baby?)  That's my motherfuckin word
(word word word) Then it's words for nerds
Tryin to rap as fly as Tash is totally absurd
So everybody duck or catch the A.K. spray
Homey thought he got away til he caught the ricochet

	Richochet..
""Called the cops, said they heard mad shots"" -> Notorious B.I.G.
	""Take that motherfuckers!"" -> Ice Cube

Newsflash on the screen, what the fuck does this mean?
It say, ""Tash is takin over the world, behind the scenes
Just drinkin beers spacin, Likwit sweeps the nation
But leave that man alone, cause you know his reptuation""
Brutalize the wicked world, I pump one verse of curse
to beat you down, beat you up, then take your girl or vice versa
You rap too commercial, you just cheat to compete
I done paid a gang of dues, I even kept the receipts
So you owe me homey, these corny niggaz outsold me
So write that blank check to Tash, the one and only
The only man standin when it's time for gunplay
Homey thought he got away til he caught the ricochet

	Richochet..
""Called the cops, said they heard mad shots"" -> Notorious B.I.G.

[Tash]	Ahh it's too late to duck nigga

""Called the cops, said they heard mad shots"" -> Notorious B.I.G.

[Tash]	Aiy while I'm in this motherfucker

Tash,"Uh-huh, ahh
I feel like it's time for a new nigga
And I feel like that nigga should be me
Hello boys and girls!
My name is CaTASHtrophe
Peep my slide out

Check it out it goes SLIDE, SLIDE, SLIPPEDY SLIDE
I'm here to give y'all niggaz a NEW dick to ride
Cause Tash is like the flyest nigga standin on the planet
I pimped the beat so tough I had to slap it back-handed
A single-handed, thought that's how I planned it
I didn't leave my group it's just time we all expanded
Tash made an atom bomb, disguised it as my solo
Now all the D.C. niggaz bump my shit instead of go-go
Whattup loco?  It's Tash on the micro
Xzibit hold it down with the rifle, what?
Standin on the Eiffel droppin pennies, cause Tash ain't friendly
They tried to pay to shut me up, but they knot too skinny
And, gimme mines, that's my ninety-eight motto
Can't walk around the city lookin rahlo
So if y'all niggaz follow I lead, let's smoke this weed
Put away your guns punk so we can ALL get keyed

""Who's the man"" (sample echoes) ""My man T-A-S-H"" -> Mos Def (repeat 3X)
""With that West coast rhymin""	
""My man T-A-S-H with styles glory great"" -> Mos Def

So to the pimps players hustlers high rollers dead pres folders
Better hold on to your funds, while this Alkie mic control it
Takin over, CaTASHtrophe he rollin like a boulder
Like Master P told ya, you a soldier; I'm posted
like a vulture on a branch on a hunt for grands
My circumstance, I went from snow ball to avalanche
And now Tash is the nigga that all the hoes chose
My style is hella flashy like Busta Rhymes clothes
I'm All-Pro, the top selection for elections
Sneaking guns on the plane with no detection
With no recollection, of how the fuck I got this deal
But now I got the motherfucker so it's on for real!

""Who's the man"" (sample echoes) ""My man T-A-S-H"" -> Mos Def (repeat 3X)
""With that West coast rhymin""	
""My man T-A-S-H with styles glory great"" -> Mos Def

My style is odd, like a gift from God
That's why I hold more microphones than Ahmad Rashad
But it's time you know my name so tell the DJ to loop it
Grab a pad and pen, write it down if you stupid!
I break it down for major weighter, CaTASH'll fade ya
You just a waiter I'm a caped crusader
But I didn't come to save ya all I came to do is chill
Scoop y'all niggaz hoes and take some 40's to the grill
I pops a pill, but all it was was Golden Seals
No need to go to Blueberry Hill, to get y'all thrills
Just fly directly over the Bermuda Triangle
Where I'm runnin rappers over in a Ninety-Eight Durango, like that

""Who's the man"" (sample echoes) ""My man T-A-S-H"" -> Mos Def (repeat 3X)
""With that West coast rhymin""	
""My man T-A-S-H with styles glory great"" -> Mos Def",Bermuda Triangle
Tash,"[tash] yo, ro'gram where you at homey?

[j-ro]
At nighttime I'm on the prowl, and I'm livin foul like blackula
Got a microphone made out of chrome shaped like a spatula
Cause I'm flippin rhymes at three times the speed of lightning
You dare to compare to the golden bear it's kind of frightening
You can meditate, til you levitate, but never rate
Higher than a seven/eight, yeah I had to set em straight
I know you feelin these, I ramsack yo' facilities
I'm ill at ease, with these mc's, who ain't got no abilities
(get at me) I make mc's, run out like batteries
I roll the bleeze and then I blow like cannonball adderly

You try to get with likwit but yo' brew ain't cold enough
Cold enough
You try to get with likwit but yo' brew ain't cold enough
Cold enough

[tash]
Ahhhh, y'all ain't even gotta clue what my clique gon' do
Fast money, fast cars, niggaz sleep until two
My likwit niggaz roundezous, we cop kung-fus and split em
When ""the freaks come out at night"" catash be right wit em
Stone-faced, but only when I'm loaded wit funs
Big guns, I'll make you do the nestea plunge
I only came to have some fun but I get caught up in the rapture
I don't even write lyrics no more, I manufacture
Cold shit, you know that old gold shit, that raw shit
That drunken alkahol shit that make you say, ""ahhh shit!""
Them motherfuckers is too slick for michael
We be creepin up on you like police on bikes

It's the middle of the -- hype, night
All the ladies looking -- right, right
My likwit niggaz keep it -- tight, tight
Rowdy niggaz wanna -- fight, fight
It's the middle of the -- hype, night
All the ladies looking -- right, right
My likwit niggaz keep it..

[e-swift]
Me and my niggaz out lookin for a party to crash
Mashed out to long beach but we stop for some gas
I pull in first, catash pulled in last
J-ro steady rollin blunts of the moroccan hash

[tash]
Since it's all about the cash, we ? ? on that smash
Hit up four-five and carson, scoop xzibit and brad
The sounds beatin so hard it's vibratin my glass
Blast, plus we drivin way too fast

[e-swift]
Slow down, you can't crash the whip
Slow down and hit a dip
Cause I paid a lot of money for this ? ? kit
We runnin late for a show, we got this money to get
The nightlife'll have you caught up in all types of shit

[tash]
Like what?
Like this, like that, like that like this
I drink st. ide's, I don't be fuckin with crist'
Cause we the type of clique that need to drink somethin stronger
When tha liks is in the house, the party last longer

[e-swift]
I dedicate this song to, bitches and thugs
Who party down at the club and show tha liks love
Even with creatine, injected in your spleen
You couldn't compete with my all-star likwit team

[tash]
Cause tha liks reign supreme of all hip-hop scenes
We heard about your bougie party, bumrushed it in jeans
And still pulled the hoes most likely to succeed
Where that nigga j-ro? -- most likely smokin weed

It's the middle of the -- hype, night
All the ladies looking -- right, right
My likwit niggaz keep it -- tight, tight
Rowdy niggaz wanna -- fight, fight
It's the middle of the -- hype, night
All the ladies looking -- right, right
My likwit niggaz keep it -- tight, tight
Rowdy niggaz wanna -- fight, fight

[j-ro]
Yo, check it out (uh-huh)
Turn up the level more so I can hear the shit forever more
I came out of nowhere, like predator
That's a metaphor, if you rap-impaired, you might say what happened there
While the be-boys clap and cheer, bring that beat back in here!
Nighttime is the right time to write rhymes
Why you wanna bite mine? I blow you away like white lines
I think you better let it go, get yo' ass off my pedestal
Before you need attention, and it's gonna be medical
If rap was basketball I'd have the earl the pearl handles
I drink everything but jack daniels
Rap scandals, don't interest me, I don't get dressy
Tha liks rock the shows but leave the whole crowd messy

It's the middle of the -- hype, night
All the ladies looking -- right, right
My likwit niggaz keep it -- tight, tight
Rowdy niggaz wanna -- fight, fight
It's the middle of the -- hype, night
All the ladies looking -- right, right
My likwit niggaz keep it -- tight, tight
Rowdy niggaz wanna -- fight, fight

So meet me on the block when you come to the west
Bangin' styles that'll wash you up quicker than Zest

Treats me the same
Treats you the same
Ohh, treats me the same
Treats you the same
Ohh, nobody
Ohh, nobody

[tash]
You know what? it's hella lonely at the top when you rich without a girl
It's me against the world, but that's how my world twirl
So let that shit spin cause I'ma play it to the end
Sometime you gotta make decisions: your woman or your friends?
My friends come first
My females is secondary
The last girl I had was this bad ass secretary
Her name was yvonne - that bitch thought she was the bomb
But I knew it wouldn't work, I never took her home to moms
You know havin a ball not givin my all
Holdin hands down the hall at the crenshaw mall
She used to look at me and saw no flaws at all
We was close - she walked around my house in her draws
But after all the good times you know comes the rain
I had to cut that bitch off for some shit I can't explain
I blamed it on her trip and she blamed it on my fame
I got cupid lookin stupid
But that's a part of the game

[carl thomas]
Ohh the game owes nothin to nobody
So I'm tellin you this from the start
If you find you've been deceived by another
Then you better just trust in your heart

[tash]
So all the ladies wave your hands if you down wit your man
I know them two kids you got wasn't part of the plan
What this world is a twist; if it ain't that it's this
I like the kinda girl that tatoo niggaz names on they wrist
Tash on your tit
That's the kinda girl I need
After work, feeds her seeds then smokes a little weed
Low key; that's how my girl gon' be
But I ain't found her yet and she ain't found me
So I'm lookin
For all the sexy hoes that ain't tooken
Carl put me down with this bad broad from brooklyn
But all I do is hit - no spark, no flame
I got cupid lookin stupid
But that's a part of the game

Chorus

[tash]
I know this love song I'm writin ain't flashin your excitement
But when you least expect it love will strike you like some lightning
That's why I'm here to warn ya
These girls in california, they'll take you to the cleaners
If you let 'em put it on ya (put what? )
You know the little wifey deluxe
That'll have your friends and family rentin a tux
That's why you gotta keep it p.i.
So even if your buck stop
You got the type of girl that'll walk you to the bus stop
True love-
That's kinda hard to find when you rhyme
I'm 27 now and it's 1999
But I'ma find mine; matter fact, what's yo name?
-trust in yo heart- but that's a part of the game
",The Game
Tash,"Ya know we peepin' y'all
Slow-motion-style
Pacific Ocean-style (Wh-what?)

[Verse one]
I'm in a rowdy-ass club
There's hella-bitches all around me
This girl walks up
She says she's glad that she found me
I told her she was trippin' 'cause the girl ain't even know me
Then she told me
She want to introduce me to her homies
I said ""Well, baby girl, go get your kemo sabes""
""I'll get my Liquid niggas""
""We'll meet you in the lobby""
She walked wit' a smile I ain't seened in a while
So we mobbed through the crowd--
Killer-Cal-style
Walkin' wit' a limp, 'cause see, we pimp to perfection
For us to catch a date don't take the Love Connection
Fuck Chuck Woolery
You want a date for surely
All it take is fine jewelry
A wink and a drink and what the fuck you think?
I mack a baby doll down, she in a long black mink
We straight standin' in the lobby straight face-to-face
Then she said ""Cut the chase""
""Let's bounce to my place""

[Chorus]
'Cause ladies
We wait for nightfall
You thinkin' that we sleepin' but we peepin' all o' y'all
Even all o' y'all up against the wall
But slow down, baby doll
You can't walk before you crawl

[Verse two]
Still close to gettin' toasted by the be	-a-are
About to bounce wit' these bitches 'cause they don't live far
Niggas all up in my grill, lookin' hella-bizarre
I poured my drink on the ground for my dead homey Par (Rest in peace)
Grabbed my car keys
My doctah function
Burnt a little rubber
Made my outroduction
Pumpkin' and her friends pushed the two-door Benz
I pushed the E420 so we looked like twins
Swervin' through the night
Everything is right
Swift rolled a blunt, but he can't find a light
Just when we 'bout to blaze it up and get high
I peeped the one-time out the corner of my eye

[Chorus]
'Cause one-time
They wait for nightfall
We thinkin' that they sleepin'
But they peepin' all o' y'all
Even all o' y'all up against the wall
But slow down, killer-cops
You can't walk before you crawl

One-time
They wait for nightfall
We thinkin' that they sleepin' but they peepin' all o' y'all
want to throw a nigga up against the wall
But slow down, killer-cop
You can't walk before you crawl

[Verse three]
I rolled past the cops
I'm on my cell phone blown
Doin' 60 miles-a-hour in a 35 zone
Just when I thought it was about to be on
The girl pulled into the gate of a million-dollar home
Fly landscape and cavi' decorations
The living room was bigger than the Club United Nations
Place was to the point I kicked my shoes off the secko
30 percenters--
When I talked it made a echo
Rolled up the fat perfecto
They want to skinny dip but I ain't want to get wet though
So...
Let's go
That's what she told Tash
She led me to her room, lookin' like Stacey Gash
Baby got it pumpin'
Can't help but to feel it
Then she told me that she married to a killer drug dealer
Should I:  a) stay
Or:  b) bounce immediately

[Chorus]
'Cause haters
They wait for nightfall
We thinkin' that they sleepin' but they peepin' all o' y'all
Even all o' y'all up against the wall
But slow down, baby pa'
You can't walk before you crawl

Can't do it
Ya can't do it
Ya can't walk before ya crawl
That's right y'all

Tash,"I get drunk and I stumble to the mic
Stay drunk all week, I'm at my peak like pike
I'm never at my peak, I'm killin' fifth after fifth
I drink mo' 40's than Tash and E-Swift

Uh, huh, I drink more than both of y'all
I hold more liquor than a bank on Crenshaw
And Tash you can't drink brew, you know you the nigga who
Be all on yo' nads after just a swig or two

Nigga you trippin', must be that Zima you was sippin'
Yo' accountant couldn't count how many bottles I be grippin'
And flip it in the trash 'cause I downed 'em with ease
While you on yo' knees
(About to pass somebody yo' keys)

I even had to pay the taxi the last time you asked me
You start off on yo' feet but always wind up on yo' back G
Bro you should know you can't drink with Rico
While you down yo' shit slow, I'm on my ninth Cuervo

Aiyyo at every single show, you be layin' on the flo'
Swearin' up and down, you neva' gonna drink no mo'
But I get to' up, from the flo' up, and never throw up
One little wine cooler and you wanna beat yo' hoe up

I never call it quits, I don't know my own limit
This Alkaholiks shit is for real, it ain't a gimmick
You might fuck around and catch a liver disease
Fuckin' with these Likwit MC's, hip hop drunkies

Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' drink on? Whatcha wanna do?
Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' fade on with the Likwit crew?

Curvoiseir, coke and rum
Alize and one five one
Heineken, Hennesey
Juice and gin, brass monkey

Yo, yo, I pledge allegiance to the bottle, the cup and the can
In front of the bar, that's where I stand
And to the alcohol for which I fall
And the cold porcelain in the bathroom stall

One drunk nation under God inebriated
With liberty and justice to anyone who's faded
Drink drink drunk until I can't hack it
Until the little man fall off the horse on my polo jacket

When I get drunk once again
I spent all my yen on ten bottles of gin
Likwit 'til I'm stiff, damn I love this riff
The Ro gotta go, I pass the mic to E-Swift

I drink a lot of beers, my life's a black version of 'Cheers'
Everyday sit at the bar and take shots with my peers
I've been doin' this for years, ain't no amateurs here
I've been drinkin' 40's longer than most niggaz careers

I've got the bitches grinnin' while the whole world is spinnin'
You suffer from double vision and I'm just beginnin'
You always pass out, wake up and don't remember me
You could write a book with all your hangover remedies

I thought you knew, I've been drinkin' since high school
While I down this Olde English, you sippin' your O'Douls
I'm makin' beer runs at ten minutes to two
While you still sippin' on your first motherfuckin' brew

Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' drink on? Whatcha wanna do?
Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' fade on with the Likwit crew?

Curvoiseir, coke and rum
Alize and one five one
Heineken, Hennesey
Juice and gin, brass monkey

A lot of niggaz can't drink, but hoes is even worse
They order three drinks but can't finish the first
I see 'em reachin' in they purse about to roll that sack of weed
Knowin' that's the combination that they really don't need

'Cause girls take a sip, get fucked up quick
Pass out, wake up
(What's this?)
It's a dick
Baby girl, you lookin' sick, you lookin' plastered like a poster
You was talkin' all that shit, now you need some Alka-Seltzer

You wobblin', weeblin', fuckin' up your evenin'
That smoke that you breathin' got that ass on spin
While yo' homegirls is like
(Where the fuck you been?)
In the girl's bathroom, fucked up since ten

Yeah, I seen her, she thought she was a graceful ballerina
Now that ass is too drunk to drive herself to the marina
So she comin' home with me because, I don't give a fuck
Might fuck an ugly bitch, but only when I'm drunk

Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' drink on? Whatcha wanna do?
Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' fade on with the Likwit crew?

Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' drink on? Whatcha wanna do?
Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' fade on with the Likwit crew?

When I get drunk

We doin' big thangs, knahmsayin'?

",Only When I'm Drunker
Tash,"[Tash]
Uh, expensive things, diamond rings and things
You know, rap life, rap life, say what, ah, uh
Rap n****z, we dippin' individuals
Some of us be frontin', some of us is really criminals
Swimmin' in the women and money we never had, it's sad
Rap could turn a good n**** bad
But not Catash though; I gaffle respect with no ha**le
I'm still the same n****, light skinded, curly afro
What's up though?  I'm still the same n****, a superfreak
I blow a g a week; catch me burnin' rubber up the street
Rap n****z always smokin' indo
So everytime we puff it's twenty dollars out the window
But what is friends fo'?  We gonna blow that dough regardless
My n****z live the life, and they ain't even rap artists
Rap money - we get that s*** and blow it
We trick thirty g's and ain't got s*** to show for it
Let me get that case of Moet, let me get that CLK
Let me get that ounce of bomb from my man from East L.A.
Let me get that

[Chorus]
Rap n****z get money, press up and get hundreds
Be like all them n****z on it
Which side rock the most; it don't matter 'cause it get notes
Meet you on the left side of the boat
Coast, drivin' it most; we like where them n****z go
We like everywhere; party where the fans go
It's all rap hype, young black n****z - that's mad hype
Got ya station in a smash right

[Tash]
My Likwit n****z made a killin'
We dropped three albums and got the whole world dancin' on the ceilin'
So I'm feelin' like the villain that cracked that safe's combo
My n**** had some hos; I told him shoot 'em through my condo
He shot 'em through; they peeped my cd through
They startin' askin' questions, but f*** the interview
What y'all really want to do? They said: ""pop the cryst'.""
I said: ""You like rap?  Well wrap ya mouth around this!""
Rap n****s, young n****z ballin'
We on the motorcyles doin' ninety down my hall and
With the gold chain swingin', fallin' to the street
This rap life got us buyin' s*** we don't need
We don't need the jet skis, but let's buy 'em just to try 'em
We splashin' out the Lex and got all the ladies eyein'
Us now, and we don't f*** around with no wife
'Cause all my n****z is livin' the rap life

[Chorus]

[Raekwon]
First of all, before we move on
S*** is like a Yukon, son
Slide s*** on like Grey Poupon
Mergin' in the suburbs
Gettin' raw with greenery herb
Real ill n****z smack birds
Fat words showin' proof how my gat work - go shoot, kill
Smack a blackbird, jettin' in an AC-herse
Big Jim stay grinnin' in a six, spinnin' it, kid
N**** who flex, Lex threw ten in him
Stand posin', blowin' s***, coast from east and west
We rockin' our vest, cannon might roast you
High powered hydrolic Eddie Bauer rockwilder
Who wilder?  Slang bit n****s on the collar
Amp might blow
I might land, set up shop, and glow
Shinin' like a lamp post, my camp post
Cream leather green leaves forever
Goin' to do whatever
Corns and crab n****z - they roll together
What up tash?  Black hash, we invented the spaz
High like sixteen n****z over ten bags
Real n****s gon' ride
Fake n****z gon' slide
Check the next issue, faggot, in the vidibe

[Tash]
Rap drama, the drama never calms
I be on the celly phone, trippin' off my baby moms
Try na make her understand I get paid to rhyme
I don't show up at your job, so don't show up at mine!
'Cause there's no biz like show biz if y'all n****z ask me
Show money, that's like pimpin' 'cause we get it tax free
Catch a check for thirty-three, cut straight from SRC
Take it straight to any counter, cash my s*** with no I.D.
Rap women - they always be around us
'Cause we from out of town, and they be lovin' out-of-towners
Wash up in motherf***as like a t.v. evangelist
'Cause they from where they from, and we straight from Los Angeles

Smoke this blunt
Yo, everybody grab a seat, welcome to smoke fest '99
I'm glad you all could make it
As you can see admission was free this smoke fest this year
All the weed you see is free, but the blunts cost sixty bucks baby
(sixty bucks? ? !!)

Catashtraphe, I shoot it through, dipped in twenty-four karats
If y'all niggas don't feel me, then I blame it on your parents
'cause tash fuck it up, don't twist it up wit luck
My style is cold like I bought it off the icecream truck
Listen here, tash be crashin niggas wit my beer
Tash be partied down as fuck swingin off the chandelier
Tash be here, tash be there
Tash be everywhere it's poppin
I'm here to let you know fuckin wit me's not an option
'cause tash is my name, tash'll start it wit a bang
Tash'll end it wit a *gun shots* that's not the same thing
Tash'll split your frame, tash swings like gold chains
I be rollin wit king t, and we all in the same game
But enough about catash, let's talk about some skrill
You know it's bout to pop if likwit crew is on the bill
You can ask my nigga phil how real this is, the weed
Smoke fest '99 burn something to the beat

*tash in background*
Damn man, y'all came all the way from where, man?
""all the way from mobile, alabama.""
Oh yeah, you came to smoke some blunt?
""yessir, we came to smoke some blunts wit you baby.""

Smoke, smoke fest time

[big boi]
Yeah yeah yeah
I was lookin to get my skull blowed up like kid dynamtie
The time is right
Be ridin the track so fiercely that it seems I'm already high tonight
But I'm not though just on them black & mild's
And people thinkin I'm the wild one 'cause I be flippin
And rippin the track and verbally attackin on yo' style for fun
Higher soul but to please myself I gotta be composin that fly shit
And you notifying alkaholiks daily
So punk mufucker you better dub bitch
What do you need boy, rap and some my boys are still in the trap
I mean the dope spot, but the slangin got my snappin like the rope hot
I can be the player you wanna bust wit
Or nigga you don't even wanna go fuck wit
Or nup wit, you suck dick, so why you all up on my nuts quick
I hold the microphone and that's wit a vice grip
Really tightly, and I'm keepin the words crystal clear
So you gon' correct when you try to bite thee
Very nicely, aquemini my nigga, not a pisces
But I likely, gon' fetch a sack of that green stuff
While I write g, yeah yeah right

[dre]
Yeah, check this out yeah
Hard life, now picture this
A nigga in jail, rappin while his folk in the next cell
Tappin wit some spoons, we do rank the boom boom
Fresh off a planet wit sand dunes and maroon moons
Soakin wet wounds, titty tanglin tunes
Musty under arms, soul shlong charm
Bump off in the drums, rhythm on the one
Stankonious under smellin where I'm comin from son
The day you bone is when you start to die
The time in between us will mean the most, I toast my high
Shit gets so bad, I know it make you wanna cry
But suck it up, button up, go ahead and do your thing
For I'm already high

Smoke, smoke fest time

Yo yo yo
Whenever I'm writing, you can call me philly titan
Receiting to you an interview like phil donahue
Me and my crew, translate los angeles
Scandalous, like watergate
Phil on the break, phil on the break
Phil/fill in the blank, it feels bad like gettin shanked
File up your taxes, I'm writin exact on my axis
From my head down to my air max's
Phil waxes and relaxs
Phil also fills up mental food up in your ? deadly gases?
My name is jason when I fill out my application
To the nation, niggas is gonna get in filled what they facin
Phil/feel the ration, phil/feel the adrenaline
I penetrate like penicillin, niggas be like ""phil is illin!""
Phil is willin and ready

Hey hey hey
Peace rap world, I'd like to make a special announcement right about now
We have a special guest that just stepped in the house
You know this man, he the smokiest cat in rap music
He goes by the name of the doctor greenthumb, smoke em out

[b-real]
Now I be, rollin and smokin
And holdin the golden sack
When my lungs be gettin swollen, hittin the bong foldin
For chronic ironic, growin the hydroponic
We got it, robotic hits you on melodic tricks of sonic
Smoke fest, expandin your chest
Buddah bless best, for you to step back 'cause your lyrics are like cess weed
Yes indeed, the session you need to retrieve it
It's ten niggas in a circle smokin a spliff, believe it
Retrieve it, over the counter, can you conceive it
I give you doctor greenthumb digits, don't repeat it
The brew crew and the buddah masters together
Gettin you higher and fuckin you up that much faster
Six sacks, blunt leafs, pipes and bong-bowls
All be gettin smoked at the buddah head shows
Excuse me if it seems too complicated
The herb I hold is platinum while yours is nickel plated
Let me mash out, I'm breakin the stash out, the hash out
I roll into the studio and smoke my nigga tash out
Wit that doctor greenthumb shit, know what I mean?

It's almost 2000 y'all;
So this gon' be the night..

While you trippin off yo' car, yo' girls is trippin off ours
If we want, what you got, nigga reach for the stars
This is it y'all, everybody ride wit us
I devised a masterplan to take out the counterfitters
I'ma start with the west coast, show em how we rock it
Keep it pumpin through the summer, stuff them chips up in my pocket
Super-saki gin'll keep my style all in your grill
Every where you turn catash last seen in baldwin hills
On the phone makin deals, for x amount of scrill
Nine-nines is mine, it's time to recognize the real
Then I swing it through the bay where all the homies wanna blaze
Rap life, the goin craze, smoke an ounce in two days
When phase one complete it's fifty states to invade
Catch a flight to a-t-l, link up with rico wade
Outkast, goodie mob, bangin out the stereo
Smokefest, nine-nine, peep the whole scenario
Tash rock material to make your girl jump up
Never touch the mic until the soundman pump the ? ? up
Yo yo, roll that dub up, three 6'll ""tear da club up""
There's no way to describe how tash'll fuck yo' mug up

Chorus: lv

Movin around from coast to coast, money ain't no joke
We're havin it our way (all day everyday) everyday (all day everyday)
Land my feet on solid ground, no time to fuck around
We're doin it our way.. ooooooh yeahhh

[tash]
Tash rules everything around you, bread, get the money
I gotta keep my whole team fed
Cause like pmd said, we gotta take it to length
Cause if you hang with nine broke friends, you're bound to be the 10th
So on the strength of makin dollars, tash'll touch any scene
Catch a flight to new york city, cause all money is green
Let em see supreme west coast in up-close
And if there's any beef I'll roast and crack you with a golden molson
Bottle, the mass will throttle, what a rollo
Tash come in peace but y'all won't let the beef die though
I lost my black movado in that bullshit fight
I got drunk and laughed about it up in washington heights
With my homeboy dee (what) my homeboy ooze (uhh)
I spent the night in jail off that hennesey and juice
Cause new york city that's a wild ass town
That's why guiliani ass tryin to lock shit down, right now

Chorus

[tash]
Tell em l..
So lights, camera, action -- you're on
Get it ricky ric' -- what's wrong? my weed gone!
Who stole it? -- I don't know, y'all motherfuckers tell me
I broke it up and left the room to get a light from lv
I came back and like poof! everybody's lookin boggled
It only took a sec to get rollo'ed, by chicago
But everybody know at a chi-town show
They like to keep it, g-h-e-t-t-o
This time I let it go, but next time I'll have to blast ya
Cause tash be checkin shows from alaska to nebraska
So if somebody ask ya - who the tightest on this?
Tell them niggaz big tash, and his homies tha liks

Chorus 2x

That's right y'all
This unity in the community night, knahmsayin?
I don't give a fuck where you from, it's party time

So all the ladies.. all the ladies.. hahahaha

Maybe now is a good time.

But i could write the heck out of it, two kinds of keys
Over the fog and through all the trees.

I noticed a samurai's sword was dull
So she sharpened the blade and blew my skull
Apparently no one had ever told her before
Mistaken a unicorn, this one was a bull
Now i cannot continue to push and to pull
Maybe now is a good time.

The day after that, my daddy died.
His heart burst in air like the fourth of july
Walked into an ambulance, his very own stride
Could not make it home even though he tried
In my black satin sheets, i laid there and cried
Maybe now is a good time.

Hey holy lord of love!
My heart hurts. are you there up above?
You show me something that i could cling to!
I would not mind knowing you care!
Hey holy lord of love!
I don't want nothing. not even a dove.
But i would take the courage for one step ahead.
And i'd not mind knowing you care.
I'd not mind knowing you care.

The cancer was good; we kept him close
Fought to the death; now we live with the ghost
For what evil reason, he sat like a host
He was stealing our youth; he was eating our roast.
Then the fucker twisted our heads on a post!
Maybe now is a good time.

Just when we thought all the sad was done,
Olivia did not rise to the sun.
Storm came up in the dark and it run
Over her little body like the devil's fun.
Now every heart in this town weighs a ton
Now is a good time.

Hey holy lord of love!
My heart hurts. are you there up above?
Well show me something that i could cling to!
I would not mind knowing you care!
Hey holy lord of love!
I don't want nothing. not even a dove.

Tasha Miller,"There is a door to everyone.
It's either open or it's closed
Or hanging halfway on a hinge
When we speak in cautious tones.

Those who choose to not keep the lock (nah, we don't need the key!)
They let in 'the all' the world can give. (come on in.)
The good comes in; she finds a chair (won't you sit by me?)
But even darkness has to live. (darkness too must live!)

And so your life...it will unfold.
You'll get the good; you'll get the bad.
By letting freedom hold the frame (freedom!)
You'll taste the sweetest known to man. (yes, you'll get the man!)

A plane of space perchance to love (and i need your love.)
Inside the 1x2""s of time...(yes i need your love!)
But hardware is my self defense. (pay no mind)
The more i care, the less i'll shine. (and i wanna shine!)

And your little life...it will unfold.
You'll get the good; you'll get the bad.
And while most guests abandon post (freedom!)
You took nothing but a chance. (a badass takes a chance!)

Your little life...it will unfold.
You'll get the good and you'll get the bad.
While most guests abandon post
You took nothing but a chance.

Your little life...it will unfold
So don't make good into the bad.

I only wanted forever...but that did not come true.
Now I knew and I know that everything must change,
But all the world and everyone was blooming in Valentina.

I knew not how to love; I needed you in me.
Never was there a time of helplessness or hopelessness.
Never was there a day without time in the walls of Valentina.

And in the lowest times, we took care of them with favors

Tasha Page-Lockhart,"Back when I was seventeen
Like every other girl I used to have big dreams
But then I got introduced to some other things
And suddenly the church girl I was originally
Became different
See the wrong things can call your name
I chose to answer when the Spirit said walk away
And now I live with circumstances that I can't erase
I just wish I could go back now to yesterday
'Cause it was different

But there's not a hole too deep
Naw
That God won't reach down and save me, me
See he cleaned me up and made me new
Said welcome back and now I'm standing here in front of you

Ever since I met the savior
See my life has changed
I must admit back in the day I did some crazy things
But that's my past
See my past has now passed away
Y'all I'm different
See I'm different
Y'all I'm not the same
Ever since I met king Jesus
Now my life has changed
I must admit back in the day I did some crazy things
But that's my past
See my past has now passed away

I'm human
I'm gon' make mistakes
If and when I do please show me some grace
'Cause though it may be me who messed up today
It may be your turn tomorrow
Then I bet you'll say
Something different
'Cause what goes around comes back around
Those you hurt on your the way up
Will be there when you're down, down
I used to be the same way
But one Sunday morning something in my heart changes, oh

I'm different
Y'all I'm not the same
Ever since I met the savior
See my life has changed
I must admit back in the day I did some crazy things

Don't stop what you're doing
The vibe will be ruined
Just keep movie' on the one, the three baby

Right on point how you move me

At the counter of the grocery store
Every penny, every nickel she could find
But she still comes up short
Just a single mom doing the best that she can,
When a stranger slips a twenty in the palm of her hand.
She turns around to thank him
But he's already disappeared out the door

Just because God doesn't part the sea
Pull you from the fire
Doesn't mean that He's not there

When the mountain that you're climbing seems so tall
And the battle that you're fighting makes you feel so all alone
It doesn't mean you're on your own
Cause when you need it most
The world is full of ordinary angels

He just got back from a second tour of duty six months ago
When he closes his eyes, he's still fighting
That fright right here at home
And when the nightmares come in the dead of the night
His little boy runs in and turns on the light
He says, Daddy don't you worry
As he reaches up to kiss him on tippy toes

It can right every wrong, help you hold on

When you both looked in each others eyes
You say I do, then take her hand

It starts rollin' and it never comes back.

In a tin-roof shotgun shack.

Just keep on going, you can't control it.

You gotta finish strong

Dig your heels in, pull your hat down

It's those days when nothing goes right.
When you're on a nine miles of bad road
And there ain't no end in sight.
We've all been there, baby I swear,
It's when you kick it in the 4-wheel drive.
It ain't the first time, it ain't the last time,
Go on and shake it off, that's just why

There ain't no doubt it's headed your way

Shootin' bottles off a trashcan lid,
And a mat on the floor by a dog on the porch

We got when we were 'bout fifteen.
Red ribbon on the mirror from the 4-H fair
When we took second place with our Holstein.

That runs up over the ridge.
Where we sing Amazing Grace, pass the plate

But I couldn't understand a word they said
Not that I was tryin' to be rude
But conversation couldn't make it through
The thoughts of love I had for you

Baby your face takes up my time
Because I can jus' see your face with mine
I try to change my thoughts; it's a waste of time

Your people called for this track, it ain't no trouble to me
I dreamt that you and me got married on the WB
You on channel 11; I carry the M-11
RJ the reverened; it's a match made in heaven
Whatever have you I let you know
I'm from soundview
Down til I found you
I'm tryin' to be around you
I'm still comin' up
Chasin' the fame and wealth
I could spoil you with time; you got everything else

I'm still New York to the heart
But got love for all
When I first saw this girl
Thought I wanted to fall
Mean the hummer so stunnin'
That my bod was tense
And I wishin everyday that I was fresh like Prince
Then I came across my man RJ parlayin' in a 6
With Tatyana Ali playin'
I heard Steely Dan ""Black Cow"" and went wild
You tell me how can I get down
That's when they threw me on the redeye to LA

Something about you opened up my eyes, 
Made me see, you weren't like other guys. 
All my life, I've been waiting for someone who'll love me for me. 

[Chorus: x4]
He knows me; he loves me for who I am, not what he sees. 

He treats me like a queen, 
Not by giving me (oh, no, no) material things. 
By respectin' me, 
And holdin' me, 
And comforting me, 
Whenever I'm in need. 
I can truly say I've been changed. 
My inner strength has been rearranged. 
When you see his face he'll be right next to me. 
Or you just might see him in your dreams. 
Never thought I'd find somebody quite like you. 
Because of you my grayest skies have now turned blue. 
You are why I wear the smile upon my face. 
I'm so glad it's me. 

[Chorus: x4]

Never thought I'd find somebody quite like you. 
Because of you my grayest skies have now turned blue. 
You are why I wear the smile upon my face. 
I'm so glad it's me. 

[Chorus: x3]

He's a strong, sweet man, strong sweet man, 
Holds me near in my palm of his hands. 
He never changes like the weather. 
Stays the same. 
He ain't my fair-weather man, he ain't my fair-weather man. 
I can lean on him, yes, I can depend on him. 
When I need a friend, he is always there for me.",He Loves Me
Tatyana Ali,"How many times can I die? 
How many times can I break inside? 
How many times can I pray, oh, Lord, to take this pain away? 
He was the song in my soul. 
But now that song will never play. 
Instead a silence now falls over me. 
How many tears have I felt before I learned to forgive myself? 
How many trials can I face before I start to lose my faith? 
How many hearts have to mend before the poet rhymes again? 
'Cause the feeling of you covers me. 

If I ever love again, it would be with you again. 
'Cause there's nothing that I can do to make me keep me away from you. 
If I ever love again, it would be with you again. 
'Cause my life in not complete, baby till you're here with me. 
How many times did I try to hold you near when you said goodbye? 
How times did you judge before you knew who I really was? 
You were the fire in my day 
But now the flame has burned away. 
And only shades of the past color me.

Tryin' to hide what I feel inside 'bout you and I 
Lately, it's you, baby, driving me crazy. 
So what are we going to do about this love? 
Tell me, what do you see when I come around you? 
Boy, you give me joy. 

Sometimes, when I'm alone, 
I want to let go and call you up on the phone to let you know 
How hard it's been holding in this feeling for you.

Tatyana Ali,"Listen... 
Close your eyes, and take my hand. 
I know you're wondering, but you will soon understand. 
See, love needs time to crawl low, and time to run free. 
That's why we should get away so we can chill privately. 
Through the week you go your own way, and I go mine. 
Never truly enjoying each other; never a chance to unwind. 
So, give your heart to me and my hands right now. 
We'll search for tomorrow under a silver cloud.

At last we're alone. 

And I want to fly so high that I kiss the sky all alone. 

And I want to fly so high that I kiss the sky all alone.

We'll bless so gently with the love that's all around. 

And I'm so glad to know you the way I do 

My special friend...we become much closer the more time we spend together in love. 

The one I think of, when I'm farway, you brighten my day. 

And now that you're here, my jets stand clear. 

Want you always near by my side as we hide away.

Darling, yesterday we gave it one last try. 
Though we often said that we would never let it come to this. 
I have nothing left to give. 

I can only sit and think of yesterday. 
Baby, that look upon your face 
Never a tear that I have shed. 
We're so far beyond the point of no return 

But I can't let this go, my love, 
so inside I must remember baby. 
Yesterday we said our last goodbye. 
And yesterday we gave it one last try. 

Though we'd often said that we would never let it come to this. 
I have nothing left to give. 
I can only sit and think of yesterday. 
So how can I mend a broken heart? 

Tell me, baby. 
And how do I make a brand new start, baby? 
How do I learn to love again, 
when all I do is think of all we planned, 

and imagine we could someday make it right? 
I dreamed you called my name 
And a rose to see that everything had changed. 
Yesterday we said goodbye 

And yesterday we gave it one more try 
And I know we said we wouldn't let it come to this. 
But I have nothing left to give. 
I can only sit and think of yesterday. 

Yesterday we said our last goodbye, baby. 
Yesterday we gave it one last try.

It's good forever, oh baby. 
'Cause I'm going to miss you, baby. 
You promised forever, baby. 
I wish, baby, that we could see forever, baby. 
It's breakin' my heart

Baby 
Why does this have to be? 
I can only sit and think of yesterday. 
We said our last goodbye 

Yes we did, baby 
Yesterday 
We gave it one more try 
Some time you got to walk on baby, baby 

And try to get another game of lover 
Yesterday is gone away 
No more tomorrows 
Should we go darling?

I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,

Why did I leave her alone tonight?

There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.

Wasted away I am dry
Three feet to either way
Can't help to think what may
Will be left around me
When I die

And the sunlight in my eyes ain't helping me
Cause everywhere I look it's all I see

Dreaming of another place
To wash away the pain
So I can fly away
Can't deal with all of my disgrace
Waiting for the time
When I will fly away

I remember yesterday
Through some things may have changed
A different place, another time
Two trips I have to make

Taxiride,"When the work is done and the livin's easy
I reside to my life so breezy
Think of all the troubles overcome

But I don't suppose that you'll ever see me
Angered by your love so squeeze me
I propose to fight for what is mine

Cause I'll take you back again

He's a miner's son he stole my true love
Tempted her with freckled fortunes
Now I have to show her what is more

With a ring in hand and a book of verses
I climbed through her crooked bedroom
Greeted by a miner's crooked leg

Cause I'll take you back again
Yes I need her once again

Dusting off my old blue coat
I wander in a midnight dream
And I guess there's no telling me
No I won't have her back again",Back Again

So I'm writing you this letter won't be long

For you are the only one I'm thinking of
You are the one that has my love
While you're waiting patiently don't grieve for me
I'll be back someday
Never want to be a hero too soon

Do Do Do...

Though it seems to be so many years
Since I went away
I'm helpless now I've shed so many tears
Such a rainy day

Take me from this galaxy
Imaginate yourself with me through night and day
Wish upon a star that floats alone
To skies that always look over you
Never wanna get a bullet too soon

Can you feel
The raindrops falling down?

Do Do Do...

It comes form the things you said
Now I'm counting down the days

I'd always tiptoed through your room
I can't be sorry for what I've done
I couldn't spoil the fun
Now I'm counting down the days

And the ocean holds no clues
And that plane overhead could be taking you away
I haven't always been this cold

I'll be counting down the days",Counting Down the Days
Taxiride,"I could be a lover like that
Just give me all the things you want now
Tell me the best thing I can do

You say you got a lot of good reasons
I know I told a lot of good lies now
I could lose everything for you

So if you fall asleep and gotta wake up
Say that is so
I'll be the one to tear you away from here

Everywhere you go I'll come running
Everywhere you go I will bring you around
Everywhere you go I will come to you
But I won't bring you down

Fly a little, take a long drive
We can be whatever we want now
Won't be the same here without you

So if you can leave a little later
Stay here awhile
I could take all there fears away from you

Everywhere you go I'll come running
Everywhere you go I will bring you around
Everywhere you go I will come to you
But I won't bring you down

All the tears you cry as the miles roll by
I'll be reaching out to hold you
There is nothing else that I won't do for you

Everywhere you go
I will come to you
But I won't bring you down",Everywhere You Go

I, I like ice cream
A kind of smooth kick taste takes away my mind
You, you ain't a better thing
But if you got a big car take me for a ride

Folding my fingers through your hair
Taking my time to look on
Dreaming of white chocolate lotion
I gotta find a better place where I can be another face
And people look on

Take me to Sunset Park
We'll find a better day, somewhere that's far away
Find me at Sunset Park
Lay back and make believe, we can be anything
We're on our own

I, I ain't a jelly bean
A cellophane sun kiss takes away the time
But I, I'm going sugar-free
And when you get to Sunset we'll go for a ride

Policemen in bright yellow raincoats
Waving the children goodbye
So I buy a dream with a short note
I gotta find a better place where I can be another face
And people look on

Taken by surprise on this occasion
You left me for a sharper man than me

In the faithful and true
I believe in silly things

But I could never ever believe
What was struck upon you
You fell away

[Chorus]
Let me die young let me die young
So I can be with you forever
Let me die young let me die young
So we can laugh again in heaven

Once again
You broke my heart
Other days the pieces fell together again
But this time it's different
Cause today my heart is beyond repair
So it bleeds
Cause darling, you slipped away
Much too easy for me

[Chorus]

When the loneliness inside me
Turns to pain
I'll drink my heart to sleep

Taxiride,"Left me here on a rainy day
Somehow I knew this would come
Silent room full of memories
Now I wake to find that everything's gone

It could have been, I think to myself
A blessing that I'll never know
And if it seems I'm trying too hard
Give me the strength to let go

It's the last time that we'll have together
It's the only thing left in our lives
But as long as we still have each other
Let's spend the night

Find myself a better life you use to say
Now your dreaming has finally grown
Even though you are near and the answers so clear
I can't do it, I can't let you go

And if it seems, I'm falling behind
It's hurting me more than you'll know

I remember the line that you gave to me
'Bout the days and the rest of our lives

That'll stop me fighting for you
Nothing in this world
That'll keep me away
There is nothing in this world
That'll stop me fighting for your love

I might have told you how much you have meant to me
(Don't be alarmed if I tell you how I feel)
You found adventures in places I couldn't see
(I could have been there if only I showed you)
I fall for you, in this place just to be with you

Perpetual motion takes me for a ride
Feeling terracoda
As I wake amongst the moments of my life
Slipping into clean blue jeans I stumble
But no one hears me
Well, can you hear me?

And when the morning finds the sun
You are with me now
And as the day begins to come
I'm telling you, I'm still in love with you

I'm leaving on a jet plane over sky
Gathering my thoughts I float and gaze at magic
carried through the night
Your Egyptian fingers hypnotize
Your solemn eyes
I could have died

You are with me now

So hard to resist 
He's so slow talking 
No need to be kissed 
He's smooth, he's done it again 

Where does the boy hang out 
They're on the street, their dreamin' about 
But dreams are trouble if they're caught 
Where does the boy hang out 

Where does the boy hang out 
Standin' on the corner and he playin' 
He's so smooth 
Where does the boy hang out",Where Does That Boy Hang Out
Taylor Dayne,"Sometimes I stare and feel the heat of your eyes
And they burn me from deep down inside
Well that's okay, it just suits me fine
But I'm not that sure we're traveling on the same line
'Cause when you hold me and you're holding me right

That's when you leave me, you leave me so light
Well it's just not fair, don't want to believe
But that's just the way it all seems to be
So now you're playing out of sight out of mind
You're gonna fall this time

Ain't no good for me baby
The way you treat me with your lies
Ain't no good for baby
After all the tears we cried
Ain't no good for me baby
The way you treat me with your lies

I feel so cold, I must be frozen inside
You've had my love locked up in your mind
Now it can't go on this heartache and pain
Our one-sided love leaves nothing to gain
But then you hold me and you hold me so right
That's when you leave me, you leave me so light
Well it's just not fair, don't want to believe
But that's the way it all seems to be

Since Juliet and romeo
When will I learn, will I know how to say no?
Every wrong I turn into a love song
But I don't need to look I just need to see

You put me through pain when I put you through love
I told you my name when you told me a lie
It makes me ashamed, makes me wonder
Why I ever gave a damn about you

You put me through fire when I gave you a flame
Lover or liar, well, it's one and the same
It makes me ashamed, makes me wonder
Why I ever gave a damn about you

And now, after the world's biggest let down

It doesn't matter where we go
This is a dead-end street now don't you know
Last night we got into a big fight
But nobody was wrong and nobody was right

I put you through pain when you put me through love
You told me your name when I told you a lie
You should be ashamed, you should wonder
Why you ever gave a damn about me

I put you through fire when you gave a flame
Lover or liar, well, it's one and the same
You should be ashamed, you should wonder

Because I would really, really love to stick around

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race? A prettier face!
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way I play the game is not the same 
No way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be

Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take

Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy
What a kick just a buddy and me
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a brand new face
For the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don't think that I'll be back again
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow

But it feels like the road to hell

I took the knife as well

Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get

I say that's what you get

That's what you get for changing your mind

And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes
Do not make the man

May not be what you want from me

Is there any boys around
Know how to make a girl feel
That wanna make a girl feel
Make her feel good?
All I wanna know
Is there any boys around
That know how to make a girl feel
That wanna make a girl feel
Make her feel good?
I just wanna know

Do I have to tell him how to touch me?
Do I have to tell him how to hold me?
Do I have to tell him when to call me?
Do I have to tell him I'm lonely?
Do I have to feel wrong
When it ain't strong?
Keep my mouth closed?
(Huh, huh, huh)
Can't a girl from the hood find a homey
That ain't just tryin' to hang around me?

Do I have to show a nigga I'm a woman?
Do I have to apologize for my emotions?
Do I have to tell a nigga what to say to me
Every time he wanna get next to me?
Do I have to set a full cat black case?
Stroke 'cause he go
(Mmm, girl, no)
Can't a chick from the hood find a homey
That wanna do more than spend money on me?

[Chorus]

How come I got a nigga, but can't trust him?
Why every answer to my question is a question?
Why can't my nigga be my own lil' somethin'
And every girl on my block can't say they don' bump wit'?

I'm so tired of these so-called, wanna-be, hard, cold pretenders that
(Have no clue)
Can't a chick from the hood find a homey
That I ain't gotta tell how to put it on me?

Why, why is it so hard
Hard for a girl like me to find a boy
That really knows how to make a girl feel? (girl feel, feel)
Why is it so hard
Hard for a girl like me to find a boy
That really knows how to make a girl feel? (girl feel, feel)

J'ai le cœur qui part en débris vu les dégâts causés
Pour endormir les plus petits, y'a l'histoire de Mufasa
Pour que l'histoire ne s'efface pas, les tueries du Rwanda
Ils attendent de nous qu'on danse, qu'on connaisse tous la choré'
Mais j'resterai sur place, comme enchaîné à Gorée
De chez nous vient le soleil, et un peu tout c'qui brille
Pour mes harbis du Maghreb, de l'Égypte et d'la Libye
Ça fait du mal à voir, le berceau de l'humanité
Devient le tombeau de la cruauté
Certains d'mes frères des Comores meurent sur la route de Mayotte
Et tu sais qu'de de nos biens, certains se payent de gros yachts
La misère pousse à faire toutes sortes de travaux tragiques
Paix aux Musulmans et Chrétiens de Centrafrique
Moi je sais d'où je viens, c'est un luxe d'être en Clio
Vu qu'mon peuple est dans l'silence, je ferai de moi un griot

L’Afrique a la forme d'un gun, mais elle est pas venue armée
C'qui sépare le riche du pauvre, la Méditerranée
Chérie j'reviens d'loin, j'rappe pas pour la monnaie
Comme Hutus et Tutsis, on cherche encore l'harmonie
Les braconniers arrivent et les colombes se sauvent
L'espoir un sentiment inventé par un pauvre
Un tam-tam, une chanson, et l'village autour du griot
Moi j'suis resté authentique comme un pas d'dombolo
Assis au fond du bus, Rosa m'laisse sa place
Mon histoire écrite dans l'sable que les vagues effacent
J'baisse pas ma garde car la vie est barbare
J'ai des montagnes de soucis, essoufflé comme un Berbère
Même dans ma tour d'ivoire, j'aurai toujours la cote
J'tournerai en boucle dans vos cœurs si les radios me boycottent

Bah c'est vrai, j'vous ai vu grandir, mûrir artistiquement.
Au début, vous étiez mes artistes, aujourd'hui vous êtes des artistes.

J'avais ma liberté il a fallu qu'j'me déchaîne
J'avais trouvé une Halel, il a fallu qu'j'ai des chiennes
Si un jour j'ai Nabilla, j'voudrais voir c'que donne Ayem
Loin est l'époque des biberons on veut des mathusalem
Une signature à Sony j'en demandais pas autant
J'sais pas pourquoi j'me plains, pourquoi j'suis jamais content

J'voulais les Nike maintenant j'les ai j'veux les Zanotti
J'voulais la Porsche maintenant que je l'est j'vais pécho la Maserati
J'ai beaucoup changé depuis l'époque du marché aux puces
J'sais pas c'que j'ai ma gueule mais wallah j'en veux toujours plus
Jamais content rarement tranquille
J'rêvais d'me marier mais depuis ce jour j'cours après les filles faciles

La chance sort de nul part, sur l'avenue du suspense
Hier j'étais en garde-av, là j'suis menotté au succès
Mes ambitions me creusent enterrant ma raison
J'ai une vie, j'veux une région

Les coups d'feux la beu-her, brolic sur la tempe
Rebeu j'rappe les mains en l'air
J'rappe mon passé, mon vécu les frères sous écrou
Toutes les familles au fond du trou en deux et demi j'rappe en putain d'roue
J'rappe les descentes, les grosses perquises et les frères sans mis-per
Au ter-ter la neige dans l'nez des frères, j'rappe pour les sports d'hiver
J'rappe mon succès, mes défaites, le zénith, la salle des fêtes
J'rappe de cœur à cœur, j'rappe les têtes à têtes
Jamais réconcilié barreaux sciés, canon scié
Hé, hé, hé c'est Fouiny Baby pas oublier
J'rappe les larmes de mon père, le sourire de mon banquier
A la mémoire de ma mère j'vais les faire tous banquer

J'rappe le malheur de mes proches aussi pour combler mes poches
J'rappe les délaissés de l'état qui sont tout plein de reproches
Mes frères qui tiennent le pavé, ceux qui n'ont jamais bavé
J'rappe pour ceux en bas de la pente qui ont plein d'épreuves a bravées
J'rappe Bagneux ces habitants, neuf-zeudou-zou résidents
Ce qui compte c'est la fin du match, pas le score à la mi-temps
J'rappe pour tous ceux qui prennent la peine de m'écouter
Pour vous j'me prend la tête j'essaye d'faire de lourds couplets
J'rappe pour marquer les esprits, tout ce que je vie j'le décris
Je n'peux que voir les choses en grand, y a plus tit-pe comme ici
J'rappe pour les bons vivants, j'rappe les fourgons cellulaires
J'rappe pour les gens conscients et ceux qui ont pas l'formulaire

Descendant d'esclave, j'sais que l’État nous mènent en bateau
Me parle pas du daron ou j'vais pleurer comme Sakho
Punchlineur éclipse, j'rappe la lune et le soleil
Un pote qui s'barre quand ça tire c'est une amitié qui s'enraye

Sans repères, une brebis triste parmi les loups
Tu es mon idéal mon signal de détresse
Ma petite amie, ma femme, ma biatch, ma maîtresse
Ma bouée de sauvetage, ma bouteille à la mer
Parfois j'suis doux dans mes raps, mais j'suis dur en affaire
Ils m'ont tiré dessus, m'ont traîné dans la boue
Mais j'ai fais des déçus, ouais j'suis toujours debout
Tu m'as pris dans tes bras, tu m'as serré si fort
Et je t'ai jamais trahi avec ou sans disque d'or
J'ai des problèmes de riches, j'ai des problèmes de tess
Mais la vie trouva le chemin de dieu sans GPS (sans GPS)

Yeah tout c'que j'ai dans ma tête et que j'ai du mal à dire
De l'album aux maquettes j'ai réussi à le retranscrire
Alors que certains profs disaient que j'étais bon à rien
A travers la langue de Molière j'ai fais bouche-bée les miens
Oppressé des soucis j'ai su dompté la mélodie
La lumière dans mes vers j'ai éclairé mon taudis
Si mes nuits sont trop courtes c'est que mon inspi' est immense
J'ai la maladie de l'artiste d'après mon ordonnance
J'ai connu des coups bas, j'ai tenu tous les roules
J'ai tourné au Brésil, j'ai kiffé au Cameroun
L'instru' abîme les sons parce que ma voix elle est pudique
Mais qu'est ce que j'aurais fait de ma vie sans kiffer la musique (sans kiffer la musique)

Si j'meurs sur la lite pour l'neuf-trois c'est dommage
Mon son passe les frontières, j'mets les douaniers au chômage
Symphonie, tempo, clé d'sol
Mesure après mesure j'ai grandis si seul
Ma musique c'est ma peine, mes regrets
Devant un miroir comment fuir ce qu'on reflète
Entre fautes et ratures j'essaye d'me relire
Entre trahisons et coup bas j'essaye encore de revenir
Comprendre ma musique mettrais trop d'temps
Ou comme un taxi qui a trop transporté d'gens
Pauvre, mal élevé la daronne serre la ceinture
Ma musique tient la route, j'suis dans toutes les voitures (j'suis dans toutes les voitures)

Lay the band tae the bonny broom
Two daughters wear the beirn she bore

So coalblack grew the elder one
A knight came right into the ladies door
He travelled far for to be their wore
He courted one ay with gloves and ring
But he loved the other above all things
Come sister, sister want you go with me
And see the ship'sail upon the sea
And as they stood on that windy shore
The elder sister pushed the younger off
Two minstrels walking down the north sea strand
They found the maiden afloat at land
They made a harp out of her breast bone
The sound of which would melt heart of stone
They took three locks of her yellow hair
And weeded strings for that harp so rare
All the things played beneath the bone
And surely know, her tears will flow

And likewise for a handkerchief to tie around me head
She tended to me needs like a young maid ought to be
So then I say to her, ""now won't you leap in with me too
Well she jumped into bed, making no alarm
Thinking a young sailor lad could to her no harm
Well I hugged her and kissed her the whole night long
Till she wished the short night had been nine years long
Well early the next morning the sailor lad arose
And into Mary's apron threw a handful of gold
Saying, ""take this to me daer for the mischief that I've done
For tonight I faer I've left you with a daughter or a son
Well, if it be a girl child, send her out to nurse
With gold in her pocket and with silver in her purse
And if it be a boy child he'll wear the jacket blue
And go climbing up the rigging like his daddy used to do

Tears for Fears,"After the wash
Before the fire
I will decay
Melt in your arms
As the day hits the night
We will sit by candlelight
We will laugh
We will sing
When the saints go marching in
A for a heart
B for a brain
Insects and grass
Are all that remain
When the light from above
Burns a hole straight through our love
We will laugh
We will sing
When the saints go marching in
And we will carry war no more
All our love and all our of pain
Will be but a tune
The Sun and the Moon
The wind and the rain
Hand in hand we'll do and die
Listening to the band that made us cry
We'll have nothing to lose
We'll have nothing to gain
Just to stay this real life situation 
For one last refrain
As the day hits the night
We will sit by candlelight
We will laugh
We will sing
When the saints go marching in
And we will carry war no more

Tears for Fears,"Man, I never slept so hard
I never dreamt so well
Dreaming, I was safe in life
Like mussels in a shells
Rolling and controlling all the basements and the backroads of our lives
Fill their dreams with big fast cars
Fill their heads with sand
Holy white we'll paint the town
The color of our flag
Hey there little lady has your baby got the look of some old man ?
Standing on the corner of the third world
Hungry men will close their minds
Ideas are not their food
Notions fall on stony ground
Where passions are subdued
Color all the madness for the madness is the thorn that's in our side
Standing on the corner of the third world
When we gonna learn?
Who we gonna turn to?
The promises they make
The call for attention
Compassion is the fashion
Free to earn, our pockets burn
We buy for love
Die for love
Hold me I'm crying
Hold me I'm dying

Tears for Fears,"A waking world of innocence
So grave those first born cries
When life begins with needles and pins
It ends with Swords and Knives
Oh dangerman, oh dangerman
Your blade fits like a glove
When forged in steel
Time cannot heal
That blood red bond of love
In times of trouble you're an open book
With the change in the way you look
And its sad love's not enough to make things better
Turn the tables, we'll burn the fables
Lies beneath the visions and daydreams
Fooled by now, we mystify the past
Like a dream, like it never happened
When life begins with needles and pins
It ends with Swords and Knives
God save those born to die

Tears for Fears,"Heard every word that was said that night
When the light of the world put the world to right
Well here's to the boys back in 628
Where an ear to the wall was a twist of fate
I will shine a blinding light
Through those hearts as black as night
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But as least the seeds of love will be sown
Now once in awhile when I feel no shame
I get down on my knees and I pray for rain
And though the breeze blows gently while I state my case
There'll be certain men waiting just to scratch my face
Hand on my heart I will make a stand
For the life and the times of the mirrorman
In my head there is a mirror
When I've been bad, I've been wrong
Food for the saints that are quick to judge me
Hope for a Badman
This is the Badman's Song
Guilt in the frame of the looking-glass
Puts a shine on the mind where reflections pass
Where the jigsaw pieces of a broken man
Try and fit themselves together again
Lies in disguise in the name of trust
Put your head in the sand it will turn to dust !
What's your problem ? What's your curse ?
Won't it make the matter worse ?
In my head...
And they say "" Faith can move move mountains
Fire can cleanse your soul ""
Faith can move mountains
But mind over matter won't you stop all your chatter - No !
I heard every word that was said that night
When the light of the world put the world to right
When I hear soft whispers at the break of day
(I'm in trouble every step of the way)
Sweet talking boys who can do no wrong
When the stories are tall as the day is long
With such a thin drawn between friend and foe
Lord help me now and bless my soul !
Look at yourself - See how you lie
Your hands start shaking and you don't know why
Look at yourself - See how you lie
Your hands start shaking and you don't know why
Well there's food for the saints that are quick to judge me

Tears for Fears,"I believe that when the hurting and the pain has gone
We will be strong, Oh yes we will be strong
And I believe that if I'm crying while I write these words
Is it absurd? Or am I being real
I believe that if you knew just what these tears were for
They would just pour like every drop of rain
That's why I believe it is too late for anyone to believe
I believe that if you thought for a moment, took your time
You would not resign yourself to your fate
And I believe that if it's written in the stars, that's fine
I can't deny that I'm a Virgo too
I believe that if your bristling while you hear this song
I could be wrong or have I hit a nerve?
That's why I believe it is too late for anyone to believe
I believe that maybe somewhere in the darkness
In the nighttime, In the storm
In the casino
Casino Spanish eyes
I believe, no I can't believe that every time you hear a new born scream
You just can't see the shaping of a life
The shaping of a life

And Capricorn is rising yes I'm cold
Listened to my old Nockles
Hoped that it would warm the cockles

You don't belong to me you don't belong to any one
Your reputation lies not in your eyes, but those who dare
Will bite the hand that feeds when it don't meet your needs
When you got blood to bleed, you got a life to lead

To exorcise our past was our adolescent dream

And on the crucifix his mother made
Hangs one more martyr to the hit parade

You took the best seat rather risk it when the chips were down
Better make it long.

You criticize the play and isolate the box.

Clucking like a chicken making perfect sense.

You come from the foam - crested brine
It's your skin shining softly in the moonlight
Partly fish, partly porpoise, partly baby sperm whale
Am I yours? are you mine to play with?

Joking apart, when you're drunk you're terrific
When you're drunk I like you mostly late at night
You're quite alright
But I can't understand the different you
In the morning
When it's time to play at being human for a while
We smile, we smile, we smile

You'll be different in the spring, I know
You're a seasonal beast
Like the Starfish that drift in with the tide, with the tide
So until your blood runs to meet the next full moon

Your lunacy fits neatly with my own

Teatro,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Could'nt stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying ev'rything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days my mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world
They were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be,
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

[Chorus]

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more
I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me
To know that every word is true

Teatro,"There was a time when men were kind 
When their voices were soft 
And their words inviting 
There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
Then it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung
No wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hopes apart
As they turn your dreams to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And I still dream he'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather!

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now, from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",I Dreamed a Dream [From Les MisĂŠrables]
Teatro,"Love, love changes everything
Hands and faces, earth and sky
Love, love changes everything
How you live and how you die
Love can make the summer fly
Or a night seem like a lifetime

Yes, love, love changes everything
Now I tremble at your name
Nothing in the world will ever be the same

Love, love changes everything
Days are longer, words mean more
Love, love changes everything
Pain is deeper than before
Love will turn your world around
And that world will last forever

Yes, love, love changes everything
Brings you glory, brings you shame
Nothing in the world will ever be the same

Off into the world we go
Planning futures, shaping years
Love bursts in and suddenly
All our wisdom disappears

Love makes fools of everyone
All the rules we make are broken
Yes, love, love changes everyone
Live or perish in its flame

Love will never, never let you
Love will never, never let you
Love will never, never let you be the same

",Love Changes Everything [From Aspects of Love]
Teatro,"They call you Lady Luck
But there is room for doubt
At times you have a very unladylike way of running out
You're on this date with me

The pickings have been lush
And yet before this evening is over
You might give me the brush
You might forget your manners
You might refuse to stay
And so the best that I can do is pray

Luck be a lady tonight
Luck be a lady tonight
Luck, if you've ever been a lady to begin with
Luck be a lady tonight

Luck, let a gentleman see
How nice a dame you can be
I've know the way you've treated other guys you've been with
Luck be a lady with me

A lady doesn't leave her escort
It isn't fair, it ain't nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guy's dice

So let's keep the party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me, baby, I'm the fellow you came in with
Luck be a lady tonight

A lady wouldn't flirt with strangers
She'd have a heart, she'd have a soul
A lady wouldn't make little snake eyes at me
When I've got my life on this roll

So let's keep the party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me baby I'm the fellow you came in with
Luck be a lady
Luck be a lady
Luck be a lady tonight

Teatro,"Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life and I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory of my days in the sun
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look a new day has begun

",Memory [From Cats]
Teatro,"Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently, night unfurls it's splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night

",Music of the Night [From The Phantom of the Opera]
Teatro,"Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And there are dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh, why can't I?

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh, why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh, why can't I?

Teaze,"The very first time I saw your face
I knew you were the classic one
We danced and laughed and talked all night
But you had to leave out of town

But as I walked you home that night
The whispers then soon changed
And like a knife right through my heart
Sweet misery again

Why you forgot me I did not know
You do not recall my name
Must be sweet misery
I'll have you know I feel the same

If I believe what I've been told
I'd only be around for a while
You love 'em and leave 'em for less than a song
But they still can't forget that smile

And once I'm safely home alone
I wish you could be here
I want so bad to be the one
To say exactly how I feel

Why you forgot me I did not know
You do not recall my name
Must be sweet misery
I'll have you know I feel the same

Why you forgot me I did not know
You do not recall my name

I was born in seventy-one
In seventy-two I started to walk
Seventy-three
Seventy-four
Seventy-five
I learned to talk
Seventy-six I tried sexing
That was around the age of five
Seventy-seven
Seventy-eight
And seventy-nine
I started to ride
With my 
Uncle Ike
In eighty and eighty-one
I was about ten
But the first time a little chick
Made me cum
Was eighty-two
Or eighty-three
My life really came alive
In eighty-four
I was thirteen
But
Nineteen eighty-five's
The number
I met this bitch
Who told me if I got tight with her
Together we would grow rich
Type of chick
That'll make a brother
Feel good inside
In my mind when I'm sleep
Woke
When I walk
When I ride
Getting to me in the classroom
Used to follow me into the bathroom
And I loved it
She was wild
And everyday
People bore me
Captivate
Activate my hormones
When you speak to me
Softly
Offer me
A piece of you
Cause
Me so horny
She let me foreplay
And that's it
She said
If I would rap
And make some dollars for us
Maybe I can get a hit
I was writing
Then I found myself fighting
For the juices
When I found out
That our little agreement's
Non-exclusive
Ah damn
She let celebrity status hit
So I'm thinking of tactics
How to leave ran down
Prophylatics
On the mattress
So I practice
Hoping to stuff my fat dick
In this rap bitch
Knowing when I stuff my cactus
In that catfish
Imma flat shit
She's turning me into a killer
Devour fools 
I'm powerful
Like Mecha-Godzilla
She said
If I keep rapping
She'll keep clapping
But ain't nobody strapping
Till she see paper
And then we'll see what's happening
And I hear her say

He built his nest

Ninety-three 
She invited me
To a party in L.A.
So popular
She introduced me to
2Pac the next day
She took me to this party
In Beverly Hills
Where me and Chris Tucker
Couldn't get in 
Because of our ball caps
And they was all about dollar bills
She was a G
And got us all in for free
Ran into Pac again
She talked about him so tough
I knew she was cocking him
But I never did hate
Because I knew
Heated sex
Was our fate
As I got clever
And a lot better
She started letting me and my boys
Hit together
Me and Pac hit the slot
Now it's out in the open
Didn't take long
To make her get it on
Came on strong
And Thugs Get Lonely too
Was our slogan
She wanted me
And Chino XL
But he backed off
And said that's hell
He don't dip into every female
Waiting to exhale
With a
Wet tail
Wish I could be with baby
Daily
But I recall
The Veteran Click saying

Don't turn a tramp into your

She always dis and
Won't let me
Showcase my shit

No surprise
I'm half cupid half relic (Cha cha)
He who treads the path of the best is also he who sins are repentable
But if you ever, ever ever ever hurt a God then we gotta do away with the
genitals
Don't ever do somethin you'll regret
Do away with all these goody goody law abiding mothafuckas and let there be
Tech nigga

Me and the Rouge Dawgs are kickin it gettin richer
All these fools thinkin they gonna stop me
I'm about to make us a million just watch me
Everybody thinkin they heated but they sloppy
Nigga, that's why you never be sellin copies

Bust on you rapper cats and proceed to (Make mill 5-6 Vill)

I be seein em down at Mardi Gras gettin flows off
Everything gettin showed off
Not me, tryin to mock me on record head gettin blowed off
Freestyle I admire
But every week you givin away fire
Your rappers license expired
Leavin nothin to be desired
Oh God Bless this particular rapper in K.C
No matter how hard you try, you can't fuck with me
First, learn how to do choruses then try to get people to trust you
If anybody say ""Fuck me"" everybody say ""Fuck you""

[Tech N9ne]
If I offended you in any way (Maybe the shoe fits)
Either that or you just plenty gay (If you're like me)
You don't give a damn you're just enjoyin the flow
To all the people who were offended
I'm about to offend you some mo'
Is God
White, brown, green, red, or even blue?
Is he American, Arabic, Mexican, or even Jew?
Everybody want to be the special and want to be the chosen few
Everybody want to be but they gonna be through
Til you do right by me, everything that you do is gonna be wack
Eveything you built is bout to crack
Everything you did to me is comin back
No where to scat
And I say that
Cause I know Jesus Christ and God is black
And they comin back nigga!

Jeah! Nigga
Like I said, me and Don Juan
Best motherfuckin rapper, best motherfuckin producer
Globally, in Kansas City wherever nigga

In the new millennium
You can't play with nobody's mind
Man
Deliberately messing up a good thing
Or holding up a grind
And
You already knowing life's a big fight
Against time
Man
Crime minds
Really shine
Who's dying
Is the kind
Man
When some of us
Find that life ain't beautiful
We switch to
Pharmaceuticals
Your nine to five
Ain't suitable
For the cuticles
I'm going bad
Currently I keep ending up
With even less
Than I had
Record company
Is dealing me something sad
How do you expect
A man to sit
And wait with three kids
For you to
Figure out
What Tech's SINGLE is
Going bad
I feel like
I just might
Act a fool
When I see 'em
Gotta a nigga
Feeling petty
Looking forward
To perdeium
I got some issues
Most of these record execs
Are soft as tissues
Defecate on they self
When they here some
I'm gon get yous
Understand this
When a Rogue's at
You're trying to hold back
His dough sack
And try to bozack
And he go cock
The 4 4 back
You chose that
So cut these ties
And I'll rise
Let's compromise
Or else
I'll hop a plane
With my guys

No one wants to see
An angel in this world
In these days

Looking to save the lost

An evil man

[2nd Verse]

For living expenses
They gave me like
Thirty-five G's
Picture me in a hospital
Shot up
With thirty I V's
That's what I really needed
When I found out
This drama
Trauma
Instead of moving
I should've kept all that
And continued to stay
With my girls Momma
Gutter
Living
Got me tripping
I'm smoking bud daily
Gutter
Living
Got me tripping
I'm going blood crazy

I'm struggling like a bad actor
Gutter

Got me sounding like
The Madd Rapper
The bad influence
The bad apple
The bad seed
That's me
The bad people
The bad karma
The bad breed
Mushroom tripping
Brain's a mushroom cloud
Finding groupies
Tugging on my zipper
While I'm hanging on
To my vows
Demons surround me
In triple
Stage darkness
And taunt me
They know I'm the good guy
Going bad
So they want me
All my family remembers
Way back in the day
I was good
But they doubt now
Disperse
I'm going bad
Feel me out now

To say going bad
To most

Never been good
Just getting worst
Thoughts to destroy

What voice is telling you what

[3rd Verse]

Mind state of a pirate
I'm irate
Used to be cool
Till some straight fool
Lit the pilot
Will I be that
Mid-town bound
In the middle of a riot
Or at a wherehouse
Shipping platinum
Shaking hands with
Violet
No love for the bane
False foes in the game
The Qwest wreck was a shame
Twas a journey full of pain
But Tech N9NE will remain
Hella brave
And untame
So make way
For the reign
I'm bringing Highland and Wayne
No thanks to Qwest
They on the receiving end
Of the gun
I cursed you
Everytime I climb
You're getting fired
One by one
But taking one with me
Cause she knows the true meaning
Of a modern day hippie
Who creates jewels off mushrooms
And bombs sticky
HOG STYLIN'
Mid West Side
And Newday
And King Tech & Sway
These are the people keeping me alive
To this day much love

(intro)
I've been around the world
And I Yi Yi
Don't know why people
What?
Why people go to the strip club
To spend their dough 
Just to see butt
To see these ladies strip
And take off all their clothes
I do not know why
They choose such a spot
I just don't know why
We get hot
It's probably cause 
They make it hop and twurk the pole
And their headlights are sitting bold
Makes it look like its getting' cold
Can I hold you tight
Hop on my lap
And do that dance
I come to spend ones and huns
On lovely skin
Booty weighs a ton
Let the game begin 
Cause here I come

(Verse 1)
Teccanina swope down like space invaders boy
Pull out the piece like on you haters boy
Forget about the haters 
I don't want to talk about 'em
On this right now
I want to talk about
That butt them breasts
Yes yes want to test
Now sanity stops
When the fannie g. drops
Fantasy locked
On makin' the canopy rock
Panties be hot
When we walk in
All vanity pops
In every glam if she's stocked
Make her make it
Frantically hop
We're all at the tittie bar
VIP and all of the kitties
Are sittin' with me
They're all knowin'
Who we are
TECHN9NE, baby
How you doin'
What you drinkin'
Caribou
Is what I'm thinkin'
Kansas City, baby
Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo,
We got relish
Don't be jealous
That's a hey no, no,no
Me and my fellas
Travelin' lookin' for them
Who does what
Make it hop
In Houston, Texas
ATL, California
Whazzup

(Chorus)
Bianks with breasts and big butts
Here I come baby
Enough to make the big bucks
Here I come baby
151 and Malibu rum and pineapple juice in
My cup
Here I come baby
Fellas in the front
Let me hear you grunt
Fellas in the back
Watch that booty clap
Ladies in the middle
Let me hear you sizzle
Yell
TECHN9NE is hard as hell

(2nd Verse)
Catch me on the couch
With two stouts
Mouth to mouth
Bounce to the techno festival
See lots of lezbo
Lets go ghetto
Or heavy metal
We slam dancing
Blair witch raves
In the woods
Up in Cameron
Rollin'
Diggin' the private schoolers
St. Theresa's bishop Hogan
Those are the kind
That do ya
Get that sarabell explosion
All of my homies kick it pockets
Ain't no punk
Trav, Dyno, Grant, Kut
Seven, John, George, monk
All at the tittie bar
Drinkin' and laughin'
My homie be	'zle
Started this at Bazooka's
Booties clappin'
Black, Asian, White, Hatian, Mexican
And Italian
Doin' tricks with beer bottles
Sexy mixed mullato
I'm comin' to get ya
Drinkin' liquor
Off in Sweden, Germany, London
Back to the STL
Off in Memphis
Raisin' hell
With a stack of hundreds
Kick her that
In Miami
In the Benz
Aristocrat
Where the strippers at

Bianks with breasts and big butts
Here I come baby
Enough to make the big bucks
Here I come baby

What ya'll doin' after this scat
With this back activist mack
Blasphemous acts
Hit em with a stack
That will distract a bitch
All I want to do
Is hit the back of this black abyss
In the cat in the hat for risk
If you really want to master this
Know it's a whole lotta cash to get
Me and my homeboys
Will get with
Your homegirls
And get in our own world
We gotta be ready
To get up and go
To the bedroom 
Or up in the bathroom
Givin' me and my homeboys a show
Baby get low
To a TECHN9NE tempo
Do you know
What you're in for
Rough sex
Much sweat
Enough flesh
What's next
Make her say
Oh la la la la
Give it to me TECHN9NE
You're the best time
That I ever had
Give it to me papa
Hit the na na na
And oh oh oh oh yeah
I love it when you do me
Like this teccanina
And I like it
When you make it do that

Welcome to my purgatory party baby

They think we can't do no one harm where we from
Gorillas and killers and thugs from abyss

Kansas City (fade) wake up yo like this

[Tech N9ne]
One, and then comes the two to the three and four
Two-thousand Techa N9na is hardcore with a K
See me step up on the track like a thug
Make it pound at West end then make a dub
To the homies in jail
When you making bail
Time to act an idiot
A lot not just a little bit
Watch when Kansas City hit
Tech N9ne's gonna spit it
You want this record cool go get it
Hot when the flames lit
Gloc where the bane sits
Shock when the pain quits
Pac would've banged this
Instantaneous when I aim at the miscellaneous
Ask me ask ask why why I'm the strangest
Because
Nobody ever wanted me rapping
But I knew within me I could make it happen
Flipping hella different to get it cracking
Never biting nothing I was never jacking
Millimeter spitting ripping up a show
Got the people trippin' everywhere we go
And now we getting you to know that misery is coming
We were summoned now the haters running when we gunning
Yo you don't know
That I'm 'bout to blow K see M O
Better bang this
People make their jokes and say we're off to see the wizard
Well me and Dorothy and Toto's on your ass when you visit

It's alive aw hell
It's alive dod gwamn
It's alive odd male

We say walla
Milli dollar
Then break a lot a jaw (2x)
Watch this rock

Who would bust like my style it's ruffcut and it's
True hood stuff bright hot wild mystic plus mannish
Alien nation invasion
Black white and even asian
Is gazing at the raised in misery faze ravin'
For the crazed heaven
Six six triple eight forty-six ninety-nine three
We back
Sick with nickel plates whorey chicks mighty mine be
We pack
Just when you're knowing where I'm gonna be I vanish
Step into my brain got it so dark that you can't see Godd dammit
Your flows come in your flows go out
My flows eternally coming out your mouth
Your makers in some haters doubt
And yes it's pitiful
Not even my pinnacle
Better know when I bust
I can do it everyday with a mind full of lust
If you really must
Get with a N9ne millimeter gun then trust
You'll get left the in the dust
Everybody better move when I groove Imma hit 'em with a bus
Anybody with a bigger mouth up in here better hush

(Hook repeat)

Kansas City City City
That's where I really want to be grime and gritty gritty gritty
Back up when I throw that V up in the air air air
That's five seven are D V

Yo we did it in Kansas City yo we did it

Much love my left mind said Tech N9ne is iggy J
You can find me off in Kansas City on Saturday at Maniax
Or at the Motel 6 laying up with two chicks the Lenny and Squiggy way
Or jack
Tripper I'm Tech the rap
Ripper on Cognac
Liquor I'm Tech the gat
Clicker I'm up on that
Thicker than water track a whipper snap
Who's trying to bring Tony Kannedy Del Shawn and Chipper back
Signing off rhyming off the wall constantly
Timing off never that clever raps the comp can't be
Creeping seeping through crevices hella beefing
Thinking they can stop the heart of Kansas City
but the heart of Kansas City is beating

How many ever met a psycho bitch?
Down with for the minute but a major twist
Came with a bit of game
Met that Bitch Sickness
Everybody peep the evil symptoms so you'll know
When sexual activity happens and tears start to flow
Time to go, they come with a big package and back
Chest is twice that
But the fatal attraction would only get you ice packs
Better watch what you do when you sleep with a woman that's on the edge
In yo bed
Cause you'll be restin in red (Killa killa)
They'll find the number to yo residence
Non-hesitant
Unpresidented
Ain't no mystery to her steez

(1st Verse)
I was kicking it
With this chick for a minute
She picked me to hit it
Real stiffly I sitted
He spit
Then we quit it
Then I told her
To miss me
And splitted
Quickly I lit it up
No problem to get it up
Then she called and said
She needed me to help her
Get rid of what
A baby
She said she wanted me to kill it
No evidence
Blood
Don't spill it
I'm saying at first
I didn't feel it
But then I started to ponder
On what was coming up
Yonder
A baby by a fling
Made days seem
Really somber
So we both were in agreement
The baby I seen it
Thinking of killing it
Made me almost fall
To the cement
This ain't a job
I can do myself
I ain't got the brain for this
So I called a homie in Kansas
Who was trained for this
He said
The way I rap
And make skrill for a living
He said he kills for a living
For the grip span
He's a hit man
So I paid him a fee
He told me
What date it would be
Me and her was down
But I really don't think
The baby was G
So we three road to Kansas
Baby probably thinking we scandalous
Can't even walk
And we band his
Life
Man is trife
Walked in
And he told us to relax
I sat
And he took
Her and baby to the back
Before I came
I smoked some dope
To calm me
They came back
And she was baby less
And she was looking like a zombie
Baby gone (Baby gone)
Were we wrong (Hella wrong)
Gotta move on (Gotta move on)
Let it alone (yeah)
I dropped her off
But she didn't hate me
For killing the baby
She said she still
Wanted to date me
Crazy
I'm riding and I'm thinking
Why
I took a life
But I ain't tweeking
I know God
Probably thinking
I should die

A couple of years later
I'm creeping with this chicklet
Little thick chick
Hit it raw
And gave her triplets
I need to learn to hold my liquid
So I called my man
In Kansas City, Kan
I told him I
Needed him to do it again
After he put 'em away
I asked him
Homie how could you
Be so raw
He said to me
How could you be so raw
We scatted
One year later
I splatted
In the same chick
She wanted to have it
But I made her do
The same shit
So I murdered five kids of mine
I'm 'bout to sit in hell a lifetime
Bid for mine
Cause of abortion
No more

Now it's blown out of proportion

When I was on some ole, low down down low feelin, depressed shit
why'know what I'm sizzlin?
It contains, heh, three suicide letters to my peeps
Well actually uh two suicide letters
why'know what I'm sizzlin?
I wrote it in rhyme form
But I'm gonna try to read it to the best of my ability
why'know what I'm sizzlin?
So bear with me
Listen to the lyrics, check it out..

[Tech N9ne]
Picture me in that casket, blasted
Never nobody knew how long the pain lasted
Keep my eyes tight I'm frightened
But I fights like Tyson
When playin this game of life I'm loosin long to be enlightened
Absorb my mind state
Reduce the crime rate and take me out
When runnin toward the Lord I see em fake me out
Shook me so from church I played hookie
Listen to the words of a brotha
The sick stutter
So ya better better get the get the bags ready
Comin killa killa like Schagnetti
My brains contaminated, hella rotten
It wasn't me who killed you (Who was it, what was it)
The affects of the mildew, my brains wilted
In my eyes the world is a bit tilted
Lord take me away before somebody else get killed
Bloods spills seriously
This is the letter to my homies I'll be missin
God told me to behold a pale horse but I didn't listen
It's hard mane
My life is scarred mane
I'm loosin my mind
So now it's time
Sincerely signed N9ne

[Chorus] - 2x
(I just want to die)
I don't want to wake up
I don't want to cause that's the way
That I feel I'm barely hangin on

I don't want to wake up
I don't want to wake up cause that's the way
It has to be

(Man, this is to my wife, check it out)

[Tech N9ne]
I made your life a livin hell with my infidelity
Remember you tell me
All I gave a damn about was weed, stems, and melodies
remember ya spent thirty minutes in the hospital parking lot crying
When the blood test read the baby of another woman was mine
99.99
Should of left long time ago like Mary J. say
Just let it go like Ray J
I know your momma heard you yelling May Day
Spent my life trying to are A to the P
You were sick of me always being be	 to the are O K to the E
There was nothing else left for me
I was a bum
But you still wanted some
Through the rain, snow, and thunder
Foul-ups, bleeps, and blunders
But no man shall tear us under is what you said
Shoulda put multi bullets in my head
When you found that Evil Instinct was a song
But the events actually went on
This is the letter
To my homie, my friend who put up with me for 8
So now to take me really quickly's my fate
I'm sorry
For makin it hard
I know your scarred
I'm loosin my mind
So now it's time
Sincerely signed N9ne

I don't want to wake up cause that's the way

I love y'all
The dynamic duo, my babies
It ain't your fault that your daddies crazy
Donny I miss you drummin
Like me, one day you'll be rulin
Lilly I miss you always in my face yellin ""Daddy what ya dooyin?""
You two are the reason why I'm still standin today
But I'm sixteen-hundred miles away
And it gets my heart sinkin
When I start thinkin bout you babies
I heavily start drinkin on a daily
Puffin, I see in my heart I gots to toughin
Can't see me leavin my angels with nothin
So I keep bustin
Use my pain
For you two I gotta come up in the game
Fly planes to an island so one day you can do the same with yours
Love you galore and I ain't playin
Makin me put a end to the suicidal mindstate sayin

Ya, that's what a nigga was on why'know what I'm sizzlin? Sh..
But as you can tell
Like I said, I can't leave my angels with nothin
So I gotta keep bustin, why'know what I'm sayin?

But wanted to make my dollar bill bigger
Turned into a field nigga
Not pickin' cotton
But pickin' up mics and rockin'
Recoppin' so I can feel richer
So I started drinkin' real liquor

And I will stick her real quick
The dilsnick it will hit her ex pills
I can feel nigga best deals
You can get the steal

Never was treatin' her nicely

Like a malachi blowin' smoke in the sky

How did I survive

Da da da da da da da, da da da da da da
Da da da da, Come on	

Do you,
Take this man to be you lawfully wedded husband
In sickness and in health
For richer or for poorer
For better or for worse
Til death do you part?  ""I do""

Do you,
Take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife
In sickness and in health
For richer or for poorer
For better or for worse
Til death do you part ?  ""I do""

From the words of a patriot
""I often fear that the sins in my past
Will come back to haunt me
But the consequenses are more than I can bare""
I feel that shit
This piece right here
Is about what comes with fame
And the struggle to keep family within a family
I give you......This Ring

(1st Verse)
This ring
Got me a top notch
Straight hot fox
We sought rocks
And the Ewok Slot
Was caught
Got dropped two
Playing hopscotch
On the block
Ought not twat plot
Yo for hops knot I brought dots

This ring
Helped me remain sane
No dame games
Came from bane
To a changed man
No cane thang
Refrain from gang bang
Slang a praying brain
Reigns family fame
Then came pain

Say hello to TECH N9NE
Everybody want to be down with a nigga
Women get a whiff of the money
Thinking of taking it from me
They get up in the club
Giving the love
Throwin the pussy
Full of liquor and bud
Booty hopping around up in the MO
Get to looking around
Every ho want to lick a nigga low
Infatuated
With niggas with dough
Get 'em in the sack
And try to make 'em let it go

Tech N9ne
Be autographing bitches
In front of rappin niggas
Who think of having figures
They get to grapping triggas
They can't imagine villians
When they come back and get us
We get to whacking niggas
I ain't never wanted no parts of this
I don't ever want to break
Another heart for this
Why the Devil gotta make it
Why the Lord gotta make something that'll kill
Something so marvelous

(Hook)
This ring
Brings demeaning Demons in
G-strings
Songs we sing
Make 'em fiend semen
And green things
Clinging
Dreaming
Thinking of being Miss Thing
With this ring
But if i wasn't Tech N9ne
Bitches wouldn't even want to be with
Tech N9ne
If I did no music
Then would you respect mine
This wedding band and music draws a line
Between
Life and Tech N9ne

(2nd Verse)
This ring
Was supposed to protect a nigga
Best for niggas
Who couldn't stop having sex
With bitches
Bless the Mrs.
Who stress to kiss us
Even though we spend on
Checks with strippers
Obsessed with clitorises

This ring
Made a nigga feel macho
Cry fo
Lie fo
Die fo
My ho
Nigga I go face
Diablo
With a hostile gospel
If I can't have tres or cuatro
Little vatos
Imma let a lot flow
What the sell
Up in Osco
Up a nostril

That sound like Tech N9ne
Nigga where the weed
Where the muthafucking
Blow
And the hoes (yes yes)
Next to me
Is Ectasy
Asking me if i want to roll (yes yes)
Bitches never gave a fuck about a fling
Make's it exciting
When a married nigga
want to fuck around
And a bitch know he down for a fling (yes yes)

I've been tested
And a lot of times
Been invested
Didn't know this Tech shit
Would constantly
Get a nigga molested
Been aproached by some of the best tricks
In the game
And they came strong
But I hanged on
To this ring
And I hope my son don't sing the same song

(Hook Repeat)

(3rd Verse)
Quincy J told me
Super stars are good providers
But
2 times outta 10
When we on tour
Family's not besides us
What
Can a nigga do
When he make ends
Add more to the time they spend
While he make ends
Everything else breaking
And the bond at the house
May end

And your wifey steadily yellin bout quality time
And you think
With all the fame and fortune
Shit outta be fine
But what happens when
The divorce papers just gotta be signed
And you lose half
And your children
'cause you gotta be N9ne

I want to relaxe wit 'em
And spend time to the maximum
But if silence is golden
Then me making noise is platinum
I gotta be Tech
And Daddy and Hubby
But music
Women mixed with family's ugly
I know and you know
That hell will be
Hot for a nigga's infidelity

But until then
God forgive me for any
Promises that I broke
Family
Can I be
Forgiven
For all the
Liquor and weed that I smoked
When I succeed
Will I cope?
Will I still breathe without both?
This ring
Tech N9ne
I dunno
But when I go
I'm leavin out DOPE!

Sell 'e to Snoop

How paid feels

Bumbs holding the pipe those college graduate fucks
I feel for no foes I kill till I close my trap

Eat drink and be merry yo come tomorrow might be your fate

Two years ago my shit was broke but now I fixed it with the quickness
You missed it when I used to roll with misfits and nitwits
But now who I do biz with ain't none of yo business
Blood thirst in the church now the earth's the worst
Clutch your pursewhen we lurk cause we cursed from work
Trying to party like a mutha fucka broke as a joke
Don't hire me but you arrest me when I'm selling my dope

Comprised wit gettin paper, an started investin in me
Utilized my hustle skills beyond my record deal

Ya betta get to trackin playboy if you ain't packin
Smoke-A-Lot, Regime is distributin max ???
Spent years over the stove in a mini-factory lab
Where illegal pharmaceudicals were sold

Then reassemble a semi-auto matic pistol blind fold!

Bianca’s and Beatrice’s are known for wettin' mattresses
And bendin' over in the ill positions
Bianca's and Beatrice's they love the way I'm rappin' this
I dig 'em then I pluck 'em then I diss 'em

I'm kickin it wit this chick up in the club I'm off the Lou
And when you're on that Caribou you know just what you do
I called her Bianca, then she said ""What is that Bianca shit?""
I looked and cracked a smile and said Bianca means you, bitch
You's a Bianc' baby, whether you like it or not
But you hot especially when x and vicodin popped
If you trippin' you can hike it and hop
Cause you know what I came to do
Me and my villains come to strike it and stop
Pipe it and prop, ya leg up and get up
Bianca hold ya head up, ya sex wet the bed up
Everybody's ponderin', wonderin' about my slang that I spit
You can use it when you refer to a dame or a chick
Don't be trippin' about the choice of words I'm usin' on this script
Don't step off in my face cause you can bet I come equipped
You wanna know what to say to get the Bianc' to let you blend? (What?)
Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn!

[Chorus: x2]

You that new green nigga Kutt Calhoun (Who that?)
You know that big-lip pretty nigga wit the gold teeth (oh) be rapping with Tech,
Heard he just signed a big deal, an estimated 5 or 6 million
That nigga fine if he willing, I'mma blow his mind (bitch!)
Big lips and all the things involved got your whole brain dissolved
You couldn't squeeze in these drawers if you was my dick and balls
I tell you man, theses dames are lame, greedy, raunchy, and dykes
A nigga gets a bit of fame and Bianca’s be like:
(Sow yo' ro-yal oats,)
Biatrice's sayin' (Hell yeah yeah yeah yeah)
But Kutty be like (Ho no slow yo' roll)
Buffoon to busy tryin' to zoom off into the (upper room!)
Claiming they Cath-o-lic, licking asses, off ecstasy
Weed and hashes, and hits of acid, addressing me
Just ‘cause I rap, bitch you gettin’ nasty
Gone wit'cho nasty ass pizzazz ashy slash sassy, Beatrice!

[Chorus: x2]

Biatrices means more than one Bianca
They actresses, bring 'em sex toys and ganja
We activists, ain't no yes boys, we monsters
And macks at this, ring ya best noise we conquer
The fact is this: say you don't wanna when you want to
Relax to this ecstasy and Willy Wonka
We slaps a bitch, 'cuz me and my niggas are bonkers
We stacks the hits, no Coleco, Tyco, or Tonkas
Emaculate get the motherfucker you honor
A laxative, cause they boo-boo bitin' piranhas
My gats'll spit, 'til you player haters are goners
Like Maximus, I'm gladiator for na-na
My raps assist the beat that disturbin' ya mama
They scrap to this, welcome wicked witness the trauma
So clap to this, while you puffin' yo' marijuana
Get back to this, (what) Biatrice's and Bianca's

[Chorus: x2]

Yo, yo, yo, baby…
I’m so sorry if your name is Bianca or Beatrice…
I know they givin' you a hard time about it, you know what I’m sayin'? (laughs)
Ey yo, it’s just some lingo, though, Tech N9ne lingo, you know what I’m sayin?
My brother Dyno Mack, he’s a god damn fool, came up with that shit in LA, doe.
Baby I’m so sorry, you know what I’m sayin', if your name is Bianca, and Beatrice, hey…",Bianca's and Beatrice's
Tech N9ne,"[Chorus: x2]
I've been around the world I ya
Freak so many girls I ya
The women I done seen I ya
Some freaky little things I ya

Yo, ya bet to know I gotta
Flex a flow about a
Sexy ho I gotta
Let ya know about her
Me next to go inside her
I repped the mo beside her
We did it show at Granada
Sexy dark chocolate
I think her name was Aua Young Scholler Halleljah
What I got to do to get inside the coller
So I took her back to the mo
She rode it like a pony
She was O.G.
Young chick it was better than it was supposed to be
Was a Mexican and Italian chick named Mexital Marie
For a minute she wondered about the chance she gets to wild wit me
I'm ridin' with her and she had an enormous fart box
So we pulled over and I fucked it doggy style in the automatic car wash
Later that date she took me to see bait
She bought a nacho plate
But only Tech N9ne got ate
The cerebellum was great then she sat on top of the snake
I didn't even see bait so with my other bitch I had to skate
I got contex
Plus I got bomb ex
So after Grant then it's Kutt and baby I'm next
So we can triple team up and fuck your spleen up
Between us get 3 nuts then you can beam up
Now ya sexual peak is met so don't fret
When I call you up and say what's happening baby it's Tech
I'm callin' to see if you down for heated sex
So we can flex and you can lick the barcode on my neck

[Chorus]

Yo, yo she was a black gold, center fold classic
Chirped to Mack mode, that ass kept asking
Provalaks and a double stack bag of exstacy
It's on now exactly (fiesta)
I blasted (fo-eva)
Another mate I can check on chess was best for less dimeanor
A record exec for Techa Nina
Like a man wit no arms
But she let Kutty plow the peach sorta like horses do farms
A true charms tale
Addicted wasn't supposed to see the booty
But I lucked up and Dave Weiner gave Kutt a thumbs up (keep it real)
From L-A-X to sunset
Trunks get the donks wet Beyonks let
Outta towners hunt sex for contest
Rican and black urinary freak in the sack (ol' what's her name)
Janelle used to let me skeet on her back end at the Grafton Down to the Best Western
Let's turn this camcorder on time for some action

[Chorus]

She was a supermodel
I met her in Miami
A video girl worl was candy
And she said I'm sour on the outside but sweet between the legs
A freak talked about what got her body hot
Like lokkipops and sheets
I replied like ma
I'm diabetic so I'm allergic to sweets
We continued politicing bout if I got a chicken
And her favorite way of all positions I listen to her talk
Mesmerized by her eyes and the glide in her walk
She was sent by Satan himself
Temptations prayin' for help
But couldn't help it still
Found help in two shots and a pop of a pill
We peeled on our way
Blue Fountain room 318
Close the windows and le me sin blow
Like a whirl wind smoked and joked about each others girlfriends
And it's still a secret mi amor forever ima keep this behind closed doors

[Chorus]",Freaky Lil Things
Tech N9ne,"I hate you
Can't stand you
Despise you
Detest you

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

I can't stand yo persona, the drama, yo marijuana, or yo momma
I really despise yo am a so comma I disapo who you honor
I see what you people can offer, I wonder what mommy taught ya
If it was up to me the G, I wanna sought ya, caught ya and then offed ya

I hate what you become, hate you have your freedom
Hate watchin' your reruns, hate givin' you refunds
I call 'em, how I see 'em, when I see scum, I free from the legions
Cerebrum, I see none, see your just really dumb

Hate seein' your whores, hate cleanin' your floors
Hate doin' your chores, won't be in your awards
Funk bein' your whore, hunks bein' of course, you punks being endorsed Chumps being assured, dumped being divorced

To test you like a sickness, I bet you'd like to lick this
From Texas right to Memphis, built with ex dykes and glimpses
Of everything I hate, it would be great for you to skate off in a lake
A beautiful fate, I hope nobody is at yo wake

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

We're livin' in the cold age, road rage
Dark no sole, no way
Jose Cuearvo, there goes yo day
Every scare, everywhere, knows bogay

This life is too soft, haters more true talk
I hate the way that you cough, hate you when you blew off
You coofa, your crueler, so cool off
If we were arm and arm in handcuffs my arm I would rather chew off

So many reasons why I can't stand you
The man who's scam is to ban you
Cram you in the can under land in Grand View
Damn you if you stand near my farm, I slam you
Sammain', champaign your family and you

I'm a monster when it comes to you, conquer every one of you
Trade tours, paid for, your neighbor
'Cause they whores, pray for, decor
'Cause your state will create race wars

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

I hate you when you destroy buildings and kill millions of children
From black white Chinese Sicilian, I thrill
When you feel sin, dealin' drugs to billions
Awaiting your death, miserable until then

I wanna put my Rebox and get on top of his esophagus
And watch the Appocolypse drop him in Necropolis
Never was menogamus, doggin' is, you're botherin' all of us
Gotta get loose from those to ex to soddomus

I hate what you stand for, hate all your scandals
When your life's baned for, I will not burn a candle
The way you live is not easy to handle
You vandals toss 666 in your blood sample

Yo, the world is very different now, no more hugs
Just shrugs and crips and bloods and drugs
Not see show no love, never we be equal
My name is The Grinch, this song is dedicated to the evil people

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

If you see me lookin' clean cut
Matchin' from head to toe dippin' with a mean strut
Throwin' and blowin' green stuff hella creamed up with a bling cup
Ain't no wicked we can kick it if you blue or beamed up

If you, see me step off in the clubber with some pros
With about 6 of 'em cut no longer waiting to be chose
And if you hear me tell my homies anything goes
With these chickens dippin' to Davy's right when the clubber close

If you see me on the grind getting' mine
If you bust in the room and find me hittin' yours from behind
If you hear me bustin' rhymes rippin' each and every time
If I got it at capacity and you still got a line

If I'm rollin' on dubs, if it's K-Town bud
If they showin' me love with a red rug at the club
If you see them hatas giving me mugs, ladies giving me hugs, no, it
ain't no rocket science it's because:

I'm getting' money from these dummies flip your chick so absurd
I'm a playa and I pop collars,
I'm a playa when I don't or when I do drop dollars,them rot weilders

She don't want no softy sayin' he do when he don't
She don't want no perpetrating 9 to fiver trying to flaunt
She don't want no punk that can't get it krunk
No she don't, that's how it go, so my homie Kaliko tell'em what she want

She want a playa not thugs on dubs
We be rollin' them 22's and 3's poppin' ludes and V's
I'm in hot pursuit of a prostitute Kaliko knock boots gots lots to shoot,
and I'm pullin out the latex and given it to who's next
And fool'em pull a brunette wit unforgettable sex
She's oohin'-oohin'-ooh sweat and I ain't telling who's wet,
And I ain't getting loose yet, so who's next for group sex

Listen closely 'cause this is sumthin you might not know
Never ever tell ya love where else you get your love
Move in groups no one on one when you hit the club
And you should know this if you call yourself a wicked thug
If you creep to the movies throw away your ticket stub

If you sexin' learn this lesson when you wash off
Just use hot water don't put no soap on your wash cloth
That way when you get home no questions you won't leave her bent
Don't be a dope and use the soap cause it will leave a scent

Don't tell a number two that she's your one and only
Cause if she know it's way easy to go her own way
If you taking chickens to your secret home hey
Always go the back way to confuse'em just take the long way

To all the ladies if you playin' throw ya hands up
To all my fellas if you playin' throw ya grands up
This is 4-eva baby having clever thangs I'm a playa

Dropping the hypothesis make knots and monopoly roll
And it ain't no stoppin' me my stock will be properly watched

And you get nothing from me, maybe some
Weed and some asti spumanti boucin'
Up and down in the bed like we bungeed
Not jumanji everyone I'm tryin' to shock the monkey [x8]
Moe doe, mo power, mo mutha fucking respect I tell ya

Seek absolute power, perfect, and conquer the world wit it
Use at yo discretion, but knowingly at yo own risk [x12]

Fightin' for my life and I'ma bust back 'til they fall
And I ain't even slangin' them thangs
I'm hollerin one-eight-seven you trippin wit Strange
I'm really real wit it, like my homie AJ say deal wit it
Pushin' and pullin' fightin' for the meal ticket
In a minute I'ma do it like a villain 
I'ma get 'em in the middle of a bomb
Put 'em on the spot 
Till the funk go pop and they'll never have other calm
Tech Nizzle, when I'm fizzle this who be you
Rollin wit Dave Trap, Violet Brown, and 3DQ, hootie hoo
For those not knowin' Missouli true

Raisin hella havoc up in the classroom
Now in '02 you can watch me clownin' and diamonds shining
Watchin' DVD's on the Hoshitoshi (It's all Jesus)
Now I keep the crowds pumpin' they jumpin'
Get back to the telly we rollin' and stickin' somethin'
Racin' to the main line 
Absolute Power is havin' Halle Berry & Juliette Lewis at the same time
O!, that's how Strange niggas run
Listen to the villain wit a kinda sociated tongue
(We're close to the end) but not done
The Tech's just begin begun beginning to begin to have fun
The curse is tryin' to put me in the hearse
But I will not tumble first things first 
Talk a lot of shit and I can't take more
Fuck Jay Ferus and everybody down wit him and fuck JCOR

Thanks to Strange Muzik I'm comin'
And all my enemies they runnin'
Now all my hatas bummin' 'cause I was summoned
We Kansas City playas and we bout sold game
We make it so Tecca Nina is a household name
How many point you got, I got 50
Here's a question to the Cencorship Committee
Who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
My villains are gritty 
Big Scoob, Texas, Will, Bakari, rest in piece Short Nitty
Growl wit the evil ways, power what the people say 
Rebel yellin we're felons and my pockets are swellin'
This beats from Berlin Germany
Throwin' up MizzIzzy so ain't no other city concernin' me
I teach it and I speak very loosely 
Stamina gunnin' got playa hatas runnin' profusely 
Now I got the parents pissed and ready to noose me
'Cause they know that Absolute Power corrupts, absolutely!!

[Chorus]",Absolute Power
Tech N9ne,"Yeah man
Niggas think it's all peaches and cream
Shit's hard right now man, it's real shit
Me and my road dogs man on this one
We stay constantly dirty, grittin' for our shit
Ya know what I'm sizzlin'?

[Chorus: x2]
Ain't nobody every gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle ya heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty


Ain't nobody ever gave me a thang in my lifetime
So I'm on my own, standin' strong, holdin' chrome
Disrespect my Villains, get 'em gone, early morn'
On the co'n, get my hustle on
I stays dirty - chippin', choppin', flippin' birdies
I'm pushin' thirty, vision clear, I'm never blurry
Plottin' plans, strategic mission, I'm on my toes
I stays with fam my mans, to shake these fuckin' foes
Lord knows all the different situations, trials and tribulations
Aggravations that a niggas facin'
I get complacent that's my ass, I'm a memory
They spillin' liquor on the curb when they mention me
But they're ain't no fear in me, get it how you live
That's if you hearing me then dug down and dig
Lace your boots man, prepare for the struggle
Stay in them trenches, hella dirty, grit and hustle

[Chorus x2]
Ain't nobody every gave me nothin', I'm on my own

Nigga
I got a pocket full of G's, I'm constantly servin'
My Nina knock him to his knees, I'm constantly dirty
Super Villain, check my powers, I get the early worm
Chop with choppers, lose the coppers with just a single turn
True to life, through the mic, they got me tellin' stories
With the fame and the lights, I feed my territory
Gutter livin' with precision, them busters know they phony
Flip my profit keep on rockin' it for my dead homies
They wanna follow my shadow and waddle in the mud
It's the infallible cannibal with the dirty gloves
""Absolute"" with this ""Power"" they call me realistic
Savage Bakarii still comin' up off that fetal living
Givin my life, to the night, on the dirty
All my might, when it's right, then I strike on them early
Twisted like livin' dirty, super savage, I'm out to get that bread
Gutter livin' that's my habit until I rest my head

[Chorus x2]
Ain't nobody every gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle ya heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty

Which one of y'all can I holla at when it's time to pay rent?
And who you thinks gonna loan me money when my last bread is spent?
I got an even shorter list of people to call on when I'm in a pinch
So I might just walk around with my jaws clenched like The Grinch
I'm, headed for trouble 'cause I can't sit here and struggle
How do I bubble if I don't get out and hustle?
I'm in the wind put the spud on my muzzle
Put on my hood, grab my gloves and my shovel
Tie up my boots because the mud it gets thick
And hit a lick so quick, they think I love this shit
It's real life gutter livin', nigga comin' straight from the brain
Some handle the pressure and others break from the pain
It's been fifteen other damnedest and ain't nothin' changed but the weather
Times' still gettin' harder and niggas can't stick together
All through my teens, my twenties, even when I'm thirty
T-Will'll be gritty, grimey, constantly dirty...

[Chorus x2]
Ain't nobody every gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle ya heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty

Yo!
Ain't nobody gave me nothin' but God
He gave me talent, these civilians perpetrating the fraud
That point is valid, got niggaz sayin' they made me
The only thing that was made was music 'cause nobody ever properly paid me
Don't get it twisted, that little money was appreciated
It got me out there again, glad that's alleviated
But the nigga that say I didn't have a followin'
before Mitchell Bade hit the streets must be inebriated
Soon as Mitch hit, it hit!
Because we some talented motherfuckers but they still talk shit
Keep that shit low black - that shit be gettin' back
to a nigga that will fight for you at the drop of a hat
I tried to tell 'em, let me do this here
They talkin' like they don't want Nina gettin' through this year
I'm still strugglin 'hard, how can niggas disregard? I'm thirty!
Watch what you say when you speak to little birdies
I'm constantly dirty...

[Chorus x2]
Ain't nobody every gave me nothin', I'm on my own
I was down and dirty when I was young but now I'm grown
And I continue to struggle ya heard me
Me and my niggas in the course and we constantly dirty

Constantly dirty, constantly dirty [Repeat x4]

[Hook]",Imma Tell
Tech N9ne,"[Chorus]
He won't play me on radio cause they be on
Punk shit daily on, industry's a shady one
[Repeat 4x]

[Verse 1]
Don't nobody want to deal with a nigga that got it together
For real and even think his own thoughts
Everybody want to do what everybody else doing the copy cat is what
They been taught, Imma get in the brain of the lame
I contain pain and imma give it to the rap game
The way you're doing it the way you're pursuing it you're
Gonna ruin it villain it's a god damn shame.

Are you ready for the real here we go now,
Most on the radio can't flow now,
Everyday I gotta cut the radio down
Sound like another pac or an O-Town
You can't have a contest or a show down
When two cats got the same kind of flow sound
Tecca Nina I'm coming to put the mo down
Run up in the record label with a four pound

Am I too versatile cursed to drown in the bowels 
Of the earth man I'll be first to growl and burst out the vowels
Of the original murderist verse out the mouth
Big Tech N9ne's gonna be the one running the race
That's real I'm speaking to everyone in the place
I can deal with you don't like the drum
And the bass if you can deal with a mother fucking gun in your face

I can't get with it, record labels and the industry is sick with it
P.D.'s some really don't know a hit for shit
Kick the bitch if you diss my hit, you might get pistol whipped
Catch'em in the hall, hitt'em in the jaw
Give it to the fans they can get it all
Cause the industry is punks, Tech I'm ready to get krunk
I'm comin' to straight dump with a pump

[Chorus]
[Repeat 4x]

[Verse 2]
How many 2 pacs and JZ's and Master P's can they conceive?
Don't they know a few gloc's 380's and master keys will make'em bleed
How you gonna say black people won't listen to this or don't listen to that
Like saying a fool can slang cane a fool can gang bang but never will get hit with a gat

You better get your story straight cause I ain't no devil for real
I'm a rebel for real that Tech N9ne is on some other level for real
You're a pebble to real niggas songs like Psycho Bitch and Real Killer
Einstein nigga that's a mill stealer the idiots say black folk won't feel us

What you think we dumb? Do we all gotta run when the heat come?
Showing original tongue it'll be fun but the mother fuckers want the bums
And the weak ones Suge Knight punked
The industry quick that's because most the industry's bitch nigga
I'm a man I don't be running from nobody we deal with niggas who trippin' and giving us shit

Radio won't play the unk fay thought they wanted rap
To advance but they ont day when I die imma aunt hay
Every industry faggot who giving money to an unk pay
Tech and Tekneko get people involved from KC to Mexico
Strapped with that fat desert eagle run up on the industry 
And let the heat go

[Chorus]
[Repeat 4x]

[Verse 3]
You can look into my E.Y.E.'s and you can see why these
Mother fuckers don't want to see my steeze
Cause imma killa when lyricals come undone I do miracles
And I come from the kingdom of rumble drums
And hums become bumbles, I'm the one that begun the gun tongue get sprung
Got everyone comin' in bundles

Act like a bitch treated like a bitch, act like a chump
Treated like a chump when the funk jumps what you gonna want?
Ain't gon want nothin' industry punks you can run but ya can't hide from the ride
You can say that it's dope but I won't buy it, you can think Tech 9
Really won't fly but I got a killer ear and a killer eye

Def Jam take chances in my opinion, they give advances to the niggas
That's really on universal loud laface, that's some of my favorites
But the ones who call the shots most of 'em on some hater shit.

That other shit, for ya mother sis or your brother bitch
Not no lover lick, packing blackened fat and blubber shit
Yeah, the radio dead cause the industry is punks put the 
Double barrel to its foe head 

[Chorus]
[Repeat 8x]",The Industry Is Punks
Tech N9ne,"You muthafuckas think we gonna stop keepin' on
We shall prevail 
Muthafuckas fear what they do not understand
And what they do not understand they try and destroy
Come on now

I hear 'em whisperin' in corners speakin' dirty talk on us
Bout how we too grown up, that we unknowners 
And my persona is rock 'n rollish yo' nigga told us
Every word that you quoted 

Said I wouldn't be the one that sold it, but ha we exploded
I'm that rap nigga that you heard with 2Pac, Sole
Lynch and Bo, Wake Up Show wit King Tech and Sway
Yukmouth, Thicker Than Water, Gang Related, Eminem

Roger Trout, MC Ren, nigga Spice-1 and them
Hit 'em wit a venom send 'em down kill 'em when I spit
When I get a bit of scrilla Tech is givin niggas shit
Love 'em love us but the playa hatin niggas betta split

It'll neva be another Tecca Nina when I quit
You better kneel when you hear a nigga that's real 
I feel 18 when I bust from the grill 
Because, (if you keep it young)

Yo song is always sung 
So street life taught me to keep 'em sprung
God sent me to kill, lyrical scripts
The miracle whipped you demons and hatas who tripped

Listen I really feel, my Villainty real when he spit
Fuck them plus anybody they go get, and shit

You can pray and pray on my downfall
When I rise like the sun I ain't fuckin' wit y'all
I'ma keep on, keepin' on, keep on, holdin' on

The storm consumes all the sun and moon fall 
When you saw the mega morion dregorian Jet and are you Paul's
Extreme case of blue balls cuz you bang
Got fruit all in his veins 

What I'm sayin' is I will reign murder you all in his name
Biss malla wit the fist in a pistola 
Dismiss the kiss from a hiss giva
Wrist slita male bitch or witch wit a twist

A glitch man abyss swimma, trick
I will never slide, never fall, never fail
Never the devils side, ever call, never hell
But I got these muthafuckas prayin' for my downfall

But the orange hair means time to clown y'all
Thanks to Jenny I'll get the message to many
The circus is comin' and gunnin' wit plenty
I heard that Bakari got a poster of me burnin'

To get his earnin' concernin' not I killed him but he ain't learnin'
Nigga you couldn't burn me wit acid or in a fiery pit
You couldn't burn in a volcano were lava is spit 
You couldn't burn me if you damned me to hell where Satan sit
The only way you can burn me is wit ya bitch nigga

Why don't you niggas keep ya mouth shut 
Without us you clout sucks you doubt us and get ya mouth bust
We veterans and better then you young cheesy cheddar men
Bouncin' across the nation and you home watchin' Letterman

I'm the nigga that got 'em listenin' I know its sickenin'
To know I'm the nigga got girlies coochie glistenin'
From listenin' to my shit and when I get her for christenin'
She splits again cuz I made her spit the nitro glycerin

I'm on you, callin' me a old negro
But I don't know a young nigga that could hold me though 
Plus the dough be low, average and I hold the glow
But they want me to fall so they can say ""I told you so""

But if I'm mutli punks would say I just lucked up
Keep talkin' that shit might getcha fucked up
You some Jimmy Rucker Tommy Tucker type of muthafuckas
Glamorize and specialize in gettin' butt fucked

Niggas think they dope then gonna try to check me
I'm here to let yo ass know you need to respect me
Although you ain't sayin shit you gettin' on my nerves
I'ma keep on keepin' on mufucka that's word

They say I don't fit in
But I won't listen

You can say what you wanna 
I'ma come up on a 
Life from livin' gutta 
I have to be no otha
Keep on, keepin' on, keep on, holdin' on
Keep on, keepin' on, keep on, holdin' on

Is the picture clearly?

Soft for the hoes you're not stocked for the row
You walk for the hot shot wana cop and do lots of doser
She devil her greed level is hella high
Speed rebel exceed pedals with a devil's eye
They call girl and strip and all borough and trip
In y'all world and dip and all thorough and hip
Hustlers they sluts and drug smugglers
Money they double up throw that stuff up and bubble up
Best believe when I get you I'm bout to strap it down
'Cause when I'm tired I'm a tippied tired when ya cap it down

Today my wife left, I don't give a fuck
Bitch that's why I'm paying you a hundred and fifty bucks (how much for me and my man?)
To suck, me and Kuniva, let this diabetic dick touch your saliva
I think I'm gone and crazy, fourteen to forty eight
Ever since we've fucked
I've been coughing and loosing weight
Skank ho, trying to creep
Bitch pick up your son
He been at school for a week (mommy!)

This devilist bitch is so succulent
Taking a piece of my soul every time
That I bust a nutt she's like a succubus
A nymphomaniac laying me back on the filthy mattress
Cum stains on it smelling like catfish
Still I hit it, yeah I did it
Her pussy travels
She doesn't have a pivot I remember when she was timid
Your scandalous ass taking a pass this cash
Got him on tape suckin' your tit snortin' and passing hash
I still had to grab that ass
Had to laugh at stories about your ragged ass maxi pads
You silly bitch, she used to be a nerdy bitch
Now she's in the backyard fucking thirty kids

Now besides being on X, and regardless me loving sex
We getting close to you Lex, its grindin' every kick
Fingers up your pussy, your hands rubbing my dick
As soon as my wife push me
Your man's fucking her trick
You don't care if she know I trip
But she's starting to get ??? to it
'Cause she's finding matches in my pockets that say I strip
Which means I might get caught
Loose everything that I've brought
The house the kids and the car
I know this sounds bizarre
But we should give her a call
And see if she want in
That way its three way sex and we can all be friends
I know you done if before
Don't act like you haven't whore!
I'm about to loose my wife I can't afford a divorce!

(Send me I warn you) She Devils in the house lemme here ya
(Hey) Off top I gots to get near ya
(Send me I warn you) She Devils in the house lemme here ya
(Hey) Off top I gots to get near ya

Fucking with your pussy is a handful (for real)
You think I'm drowning but I'm clowing
So basically bitch you a damn fool
And that's a given fact
Plus I remember back when you was young
I could see a hundred niggaz through your gap
And all of them was probably hitting that, that's embarrassing
You stuck with thirty children, seventy miscarriages
In and out of buildings, ain't carin' who it is
Fucking newly weds, didn't mean to do it but you did

Devil is she, she never to be (faithful)
Credit to free its better that she (tranquil)
Even her apple
My cock unlock the keys to your asshole
Stop the plot through the freeze with my cash flow
Cock the Glock at them ??? in the castle
Fresh out of school with a disease in the tassel
Skis in the satchel
You just my (ho) that's the reason you stack dough

Shit this feels good baby whatchu say this was again?

Lips like ooh
An angel mane
But she had the devil's eyes
I had to have her cat

[Verse 1]
Pass me the 151 and coke cat
And later we'll find where the dope at
but hold that
I seen something so fat
That wish I could've drove back
To get my codac
Strip teeasa!
Loving who got the visa
Got up and she will please ya
Not of then she don't need ya
Product Gucci Felecia
It's a duty to feed ya
Amnesia
Caribou and tequezia
Off the turnbuckle baby bub I have the booties and boobies
It was nootie so cootie was a cutey
I gotta get neara
I got mucho dinero
Look at her look at herself in the mirror
Moving like Shakira
Made my way
To the front of the stage
100's for days
Big body I wanted to praise
Will she get with a nigga? maybe!
She bent over and said thanks and I whispered in her ear

[Chorus x2]
Tech: I love the way you make it slither baby
Every night when I come through
That looks like something that I want to run through
Girl: You want some, ooh
Tech: You know I want to
Girl: Baby we can have fun too (I love the way you make it slither baby)

[Verse 2]
Well she asked me for a lap dance
And Trav said she too fine, fat chance
Boy I'm Tech N9ne I rap and
I slap hands
With millionaires plus I got stacks man
She approached me slowly
Holy moly
Chef Boy are Dee's cheese and beef ravioli
Hold me close
Nose be ope
How much evil can dough provoke
How much she told me nope
Cause this one was on her
I'm hoping I can get the chance to put it on her
She slithered on me put the booty in my lap and got to gyrating
Was I waiting
For the pushing grabbing and vibrating
But this is really when my pupils got to dilating
What kind of magical hocus pocus was I facing
Over and over I tried to explain it the best that I could
She put the mouth on the crotch of my pants and said (HERRRRRH)
[Hook]

Tech: Shit
Girl: you like that baby?
Tech: How about me and you leave here baby so we can do that shit you just did
Over and over again

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
Said she needed 400 to tip out
I whip out
The grip so quick so we can dip out
The trick house
Told my homies not to poke they lip out
I'm going to rip out
The guts and try to throw my hip out
Now it's time to trip out
Got at the bitch house
Was three fine female roommates my homies missed out
Took me to her room and threw me right on the bed
Got right on the head
What a wonderful night it was said
Then along came 3
36 double D's
Sizes kissing and licking on me
They coming to do what
Wake my dude up
But one of them bitches bit me on the neck and drew blood
Then the other and the other
Instead of bud lovers
I'm trapped with blood sucking motherfuckers for eternity
Brought me here to straight feed on a nigga
All because I said to a stripper

Let's go to the Ex house
That's where Heather and Marty got everybody Exed out
Walkin the crib
My homegirl say Tech's with me
'cause she know all the bitches want to get next to me
I'm a star and ladies want to have sex with me
But the bitches still get jealous offa Ecstacy
It's like thirty people in the house (Jeah!)
Rave bitches, massage and glow sticks in the mouth (Jeah!)
I take another cap of G with my Mountain Dew (Jeah!)
I'm higher than the top floor of the Fountain Blue (Jeah!)
Somebody said they got the chronic, line it up mane (Jeah!)
Let's smoke it all til we fall then get up again (Jeah!)
I want to fuck but I'm numb 'cause I'm fizzled up (Jeah!)
Skip to the Lou, I tried to piss dick is shriveled up (Jeah!)
My nigga Kutt got the blunt nigga pass it (Jeah!)
I didn't even know you was here
so he passed it with a couple hits of acid (Jeah!)
Like I refuse to stay alive (Jeah!)
It's pills and mo thrills, I'm lucky if I survive
I'm high!

This is the Tech N9ne experience

Dipped out the Ex house
It's right around two
Off to Westport to kick it with the Hurricane Crew
Saw my niggas see and G after party at the room
My homegirl Iesha slipped me a couple grams of shrooms
Damn, it don't stop
Embasy suites three o'clock
With my niggas see and G
Make a hella G and E
I get, two more hits of that Ecstacy shit
I don't want to come down off that Ecstacy trip
Bitches, in the room lookin so fresh so clean
A couple, hella high panties, and brought no jeans
My nigga said that he got codeine
Mixed it with cherry roper tussin and duece I took a sip of his lean
In the bathroom to bust a shit (Jeah!)
I couldn't do it so my bitch came to suck the dick (Jeah!)
It was hard and soft but hard enough to penetrate the slit (Jeah!)
Bout twenty minutes damn near fainted when it was time to spit (Jeah!)
Five o'clock in tha mornin and we still zoned (Jeah!)
Seven o'clock in tha mornin pill is still on (Jeah!)
This life I live, I might not die
If let lone (Jeah!)
Love my experience
This is my fucked up life (Jeah!)
Don't try this at home
Yeah!

Girl: Wassup for today?
Tech N9ne: Whatever
Girl: want to get high?
Tech N9ne: Let's do it",T9X
Tech N9ne,"Yo what's up.
For those who don't know.
I go by the name of Tech N9ne.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
Some of the things already known, that are familiar with me.
and my thoughts.. so these are the real thoughts.
I'ma share with you like this.

Don't you come near me 'cause the Devil's sittin' next to me
I drink my drink, and smoke my weed and pop my ecstasy
Then add some GHB and mushrooms to the recipe
This means I'm really lettin the beast within get the best of me

If you can hear me, I need help
I'm caught and I'm stuck and I'm trapped in this self
Don't understand this fucked up hand that G dealt
Lazarus help me 'cause it's hazardous to T's health
He's set trippin' he's tryna get a nigga killed
and get a nigga peeled, the other side is gonna rid 'em in the field
No sentimental feelings, send 'em in the cold buildings
I tried to tell him where you go you will not see your women and your children
He popped, fifteen hits of ex in one night
Lick dick tips have sex with some dykes
And he won't use protection for my erection
Constantly makin' me get that pencillin injection

Wait, I hear voices, speakin' from inside
I'm out front waitin', he creepin' and he hides
I can't help but notice he's kinda stuck up, I'ma let it slide
But in the meantime shut the fuck up, and just ride

[Chorus]
Oooooh I'm a psycho baby.
Oooooh it's about to drive me crazy.
Oooooh I'm a psycho baby.
Oooooh it's about to drive me crazy.

When I was younger I used to faint at the sight of blood
Now that I'm older I notice that it ain't at the sight of blood
Now the sight of blood equals the very first sign of love
Menstrual cycles, feeling like you right at your height of drugs
Bleed for me baby, made your heart rage
Fuckin' you makes me feel a murderous sensation, blood mixed with ejaculation
Cum bustin', bump heads 'til concussions
After we done fuckin', if I can't get the spirit I've won nothin'

I got children, and a wife
He's thinkin' of leapin' off a buildin', takin' flight
By now somebody shoulda killed him, end his life
Too many motherfuckers feel him, and his mic
Somebody stop him 'cause he's fuckin' up my livelihood
With me trapped inside this psycho how can I be good
To my wife the (?) only close to it for money, he's in it
A monster running back and forth from the free clinic
If you a friend, time to say toodaloo
'Cause ain't no possible way he can ever be true to you
Careful your appointment could do the due
If he wants to kill hisself, what the fuck you think he want to do to you?

[Chorus]

I am a nightmare walkin', psychopath talkin'
Brain deteriorating 'cause I'm ex pill poppin'
I got more troubles, whatever you got it doubles and triples
and quadruples, havin fantasies of eatin' nipples and noodles
Drugs take the pain away
Used to have a lotta love but now I fade away
The fact, that women love the music and they open they legs
for a psychopathic nigga that's so fucked up in the head, it's beautiful
(Told my parents this isn't suitable)
Devil bitches'll learn (No!) Gotta recruit a few
(This nigga's gonna do me harm! I'm drugged up and I'm torn!)
(Look at this motherfucker he colored my hair orange!)
You can't touch me, everybody loves me
Listening to my music, children are gettin' ugly
If I told you everything I was thinkin' it wouldn't be G
Tellin' you how many crossed my path just wouldn't be me
But they know, 'cause they way low
About some ex and fry and jayo and fuck a halo
Alotta Jim Beam to have grim dreams would be healthy
(Aiyyo I'm trapped in psycho's body, can ya help me?)

[Chorus: x3]",Trapped in a Psycho's Body
Tech N9ne,"I'ma tell y'all a lil' story man, yaknahm'sayin? 
Yo this is a song about, somebody who did me wrong dawg
I thought you was my homie man I guess not
Fuck it

You was supposed to be my, dawg
Homie when I first met you what was told to me was, fraud
What a shocker, and imposter, I've been crossed, I lost ya
My best friend turned out to be an enemy, that's endin' me
Hidden, no sympathy, no empathy either, homie I never denied ya
Nuttin' that you wanted - women? I never playa-hated
I hooked you up, booked you up from the beginning
This enemy had love for you, shared blood for ya
When ya wanted to dig I dug for ya nigga
But you a double-crosser, nasty hand-tosser
I shoulda known you was evil when ya told me you was cool
For we could be sex fools when we under the steeple, the retrieval
I'm tryna get my life back
No more stoppin' women from puttin' a knife at ya cap
Remember when we was kickin' it, bitches was givin' it everyday
We did it in every way, but the respect went away
You got a mind of your own now
You're grown now, can I ask you a question?
Did you forget we kinfolks nigga, we the same complexion?
I'm stressin'  you was always in front of me so I listened
Everyday you wanted me on a mission
I even let you have sex with my lady like a G
Infatuated with you and not me
I sucked it up, I got back wit her, you fucked it up
By lettin her know I was creepin around, with every chick in the town, Buster!
I shoulda known not to trust ya
Listen I'm losin' my life because of you!
I lost my life because of you! I'm losin my wife because of you!
I even had sex and a baby with the crazy bitch you introduced me to!
Now I'm straight depressed, I hate your flesh
But fate was just, belate to Tech, laid to rest
Every time you got drawers, you made my poor little life fall
Nigga ya got balls you ain't never had a partner like me
Real, I never ever sold ya pipe dreams
Personal yes it might seem, nigga when you was burnin'
I went to get the doctor's side cleaned
Looked out for ya health, and this is the respect I get?
Hater, ya neck I'll slit, but I cain't 'cause I'm attached to ya
And I don't know why, sometimes I wish you would just die
That would eliminate all this hurt
Maybe I could get up outta all this dirt, ya caused me
So strong, nothing could stop you, not even cerebral palsy
I can't believe it; my best homie turned on me
You musta forgot we grew up together
I'm through, life is over now, there's nothin' else to do
Point the finger and blame it on you

(It's all because of you, you, you)
I lost my girl, my world, is upside down because I found you wasn't shit
(It's all because of you, you, you)
Broke us in two, you untrue, don't know what to do, I'm talkin' to you (who?) 
My dick",Worst Enemy
Tech N9ne,"[Tech talkin]
Huh, My nigga Don Juan...damn
I Been knowin you a long time nigga, heh
We did a lot of shit together man

Beautiful shit we did dog
Remember when we went out to L.A. man, wit Quincy man
Made all that shit pop

Dubb see and everybody
Had a lot of good times dog

But that shits about to come to an end dog

Never have I ever crossed anybody, y'all niggas know me
The sands of time have already started to pour against you dog
So listen hard
Cuzz I'm speak real softly 
Like this
[Tech N9ne]
Just think
What if I could just, just blink ya shit away
Niggas think 
Because a nigga bust, I grips and grips to pay
The pain grows in fame and kangos we're changin strange hoes
Who bang in Range Roves for thangs same shows, wit lames
The rains goes will stain and insane foes who drain 
And hang rows wit brains
If you brought it, that means you got it
And if you brought, that means you should have shot it
Cuzz I'm about to drop the ray and Nina 
Locked to kill a liter
Proped to meaner nigga
I pop the millameter
Demarco I'm bout to spark flow ya bark so hearts wit parts
Gonna make ya heart blow (heart blow), blood
And don't be was-in, cuzz-in me buggin me
Bout dubbs I be musclin these clubs really lovin me
It hurts my nigga the hurt my nigga
But hurt my nigga is what's inspiring these spurts my nigga
At first my nigga
Used to be my homie, used to be my ace
Yellin you gonna slap the taste out my mouth
Nigga I never scare
Savoir faires everywhere
If you need me believe me its easy
To put hoes in shock to tizzie
Watch the wizzie
These glocks'll talk fa shizzie
[Hook: repeat 2X]
Some say I should worry and watch where I walk
Yada yada yada nigga, that's just talk
I'm a friend, if I was a foe, I would be
Kno-kno-kno-kno-kno-kno-kno-knockin at yo front door
[Tech N9ne]
Industry's faulty, idustry's salty (man)
The industry cost me, industry brought me (pain)
The industry taught me, industry caught me (strain)
And you niggas know that the industry's awfully (vain)
I ain't a snake nigga all I did is make niggas money
Wit sonny now its funny, you playa hate niggas
Over some cake the fake of a show me state nigga
In my face will be Don Juan The Great to late nigga 
I don't speak a lot I peep a lot I creep a lot 
And people who speakin usually weak and out for peace and no beef a lot
Remember we used to kick it like bros
Now you niggas act like bitches and hoes
Wit ya licorice souls 
Tecca N9ne I got the wickedest flows 
No kid in this MO, no mysery will ever get wit this Rouge
I'm pissed in this hole 
Little for side a crypt in his soul 
Instead of a rap I should have twisted his nose
Who kept Short Nitty from killin you (Me)
Who kept Diamond from drillin you (Me)
Whp kept villain niggas from bill dealin you (Me)
So now you can take away me and keep on talkin crazy
And I'ma let 'em know where you keep your baby
And where you stay D
[Hook]
[Tech N9ne]
You can't turn enough muthfackas against me
You can't find a harder rapper that'll convince me
I'm wit the Canties, the Ashbees, the White Bears
La Zhunes, the Harris's, and the muthafuckin Timleys
The theories, the buyers, the Kennedy's
You know the families that are known to be bad for humanity
Can he be bad, can he be tough, can he be rough
No cream puff are considered to be rough enough
Nobody likes you not even ya bitches I'm a witness
They sick of yo disrespectful way of speakin explicit
Always talkin about how big yo dick is
Betta hope Anghellic go mutli-platinum to get yo riches, blood
This is the end of men who were once friends and then
One asshole thought he was somethin 
When punks bend over they get FUCKED (get fucked)
So hand over them Tech tapes or get STUCK (get stucked)
You must think I'm soft for talkin to Icey Rock bout the Nina out
I'm trippin without a doubt 
I'm a tell you really is yo friend
Mail Bakari and maybe you and him can get together
And tell like it is again
It's over man, I hope you brought your novacain
I know the pain, is slowly takin over brain 
So calm that mufuckin wombat
I don't need no Don Juan tracks 
To come bomb on rap

[Tech talkin]
That's what I'm speakin on dog that's real shit
Nigga once said to me 
Nigga walk around like his shit don't stink
Gonna cut ya nose off and stick up ya ass so you can smell that shit man
Ya know what I'm sizzlin

Ain't no wicked we can kick it if you blue or beamed up

With about 6 of `em cut no longer waiting to be chose
And if you hear me tell my homies anything goes

[Repeat: x8]
With these chickens dippin' to Davy's right when the clubber close

If you bust in the room and find me hittin' yours from behind

If I got it at capacity and you still got a line

No she don't that's how it go so my homie Kaliko tell'em what she want 

She want a playa not thugs on dubs

I'm in hot pursuit of a prostitute Kaliko knock boots gots lots to shoot
And I'm pullin' out the latex and given it to who's next
And fool'em pull a brunet wit' unforgettable sex
She's oohin-oohin' sweat and I ain't telling who's wet
And I ain't getting loose yet so who's next 4 group sex

[Chorus: x2]

Never ever tell ya love where else you get your love
Move in groups no one on one when you hit the club
And you should know this if you call yourself a wicked thug

[Repeat: x4]
If you creep to the movies throw away your ticket stub 

If you sexin' learn this lesson when you wash off
Just use hot water don't put no soap on your wash cloth
That way when you get home no questions you won't leave her bent

[Repeat: x8]
Don't be a dope and use the soap cause it will leave a scent 

Don't tell a #2 that she's your one and only
Cause if she know it's way easy to go her own way
If you talking chickens to your secret home hey

Always go the back way to confuse 'em just take the long way

To all the ladies if you playin' throw ya hands up
To all my fellas if you playin' throw ya grins up

[Intro]
The strangest, straight derangest, start it J, start it J
Uh, MidWest Side, IIIDQ found laughin
 
[Verse 1]
Lets get it on, raps new phenomenon
Hitt'em up with the flips
Rupture your dome
Calm down, you say me song sound like Butch?
You say I'm washed up? Nigga what!?
This is when I kick it with this rhythm-simplistic
Fuck dem 9 rhymes, make them go blind every time
On that cannabis, edist, not for a weak mind
But the mind of a gauge
On stage cuzz minimum wage has me on maximum rage
Page mac, lets scrap, the conniseur of rap
See me, come tight like a pig in a bikini
Please! All emcees know I be on my Q's and P's
Even Run-D.M.C. is on a deadly disease
High voltage, take a look at the psychosis
Deranged, I claim, let me explain
Fatrocious, flows be cocked from KC to Wisconsin
My killer flow makes me jerk my Johnson
 
[Verse 2]
Mushroom headed keeps me pathetic,
But the ?
Treating life like I'm moving bombay
Brother with the ganja stickin it
Gonna stick it if you let it
Come here, no come?
I'll run dancing
Just call me the strangest, straight G, bombay
Distinguish the fuck of shit
From hip-hop comes this
Apocoflips got control of your hips
Its venomous, how the rap metamorphasis
MC corpsesis around me
They found me jacuzzin with my sorcerists
Fire up the paper & get blowed
Then roll to a spot with bianca
Then bust holes in these hoes
Cuzz they want to kill me like they killed Bruce Lee
On the set, no shit
Told my bianca that's what she gets
Middle West flex flows, mics to sex those
Middle West flesh holes, insane games
Never that plane Jane
 
[Verse 3]
I give myself a see-section
With a rusty jagged weapon
Bungee wit 100 feet of slack
IN front of my kids with no discretion
Strange days like Julia Lewis and Angela Bassett in a casket
Trippin with the 9
Get your brain blown like a head gasket
Missouri is in the house for the '99 shot
Futuristic ladies love me a whole whole lot
When demons try to do me too
They know they wicked
So I bust if you ain't down with IIIDQ
Who are you!?!
Neena Tech, respect, MidWest Side
For life, grab a mic, and flip it like a dyke
The soundlab got my microchip screwed
Mounfunction, ?, now I'm cool
Pain givers, slang spitters, hang niggas, insane triggas
no shame, aim triggas, brain splitters, game quitters? NO!

Jealous fellas man
Fall up in the spot and from the jump they don't like me
Hat to the back and I'm felling real hyphy
Imma star so I'm in with the belly pistol
That's cause the haters be sucking on jelly sickles
That mean the cycle of jealousies real thick man
I'm feeling its bout to pop off real quick man
But I ain't trying to have the fedas come and pinch me
Cause he's plotting on my cheddar on my minske
Never tempt me the grench so you better
Never let another nell nother fella come against me
Off in Missouri its jelly sickle city jealousy
Watching and it ain't the right stare, nightmares
Don't let me go and rock the red spiked hair

Where they cook them fried turkeys
Be up in Houston with Mike Jones and Paul Wall
You want that fast quota
I want that slow nickle
Everything I got I worked for so quit hating on me nigga
Look at the trees, look at the sky, look at the moon
Look at these keys, look at my ride, I'ma tycoon
From the land of the gangsters and pimps and hustlers
Where a hundred will get you three hundred dollars worth of poppers
Every time I look around
Every time I look around somebody done bit my style
Wanna smile in my face and take my place hate
But it ain't gone be no way no how

Playa haters from Calabassas to Melrose
During his jail pulls
And knocked him out of his shell toes
When I walk into the spot them suckas sucking on them sickles
Hate to see me shining get to tripping when they off they ripple
I get these rappers dripping jelly to the third degree
Most of them in my city never know me but yet they heard of me
At the BET awards chilling with the Federation
Never forget the woman at the door giving
Away the shoes didn't really want me to have 'em
Man I had a ticket I had to grab 'em
Come to find out I was in a rhyme bout a couple years ago
Here's the blow cause I rake up dough
She was one of the women I left behind up at the wake up show
Congratulate me cause I'm a go getta
For sho hitta E-40 and Nina some flow spitter's
But that don't mean you gotta hate
Jealousy's a sickness take another lick Mitch

Tech N9ne,"Real cocky
Real sloppy
Drunk at the club and y'all can't stop me

Super star style
Whoop the are pounds
Out the roof, scoop the group we be troopin' large crowds
Yes we are foul and we rich now

Used to be all of me, but it's all on the bitch now
They wanna get me stuck, they comin' into my world
It's too late I got my wife, my bitch, my girl

I was nineteen, met a nice queen
Car was light green, naughty as ice cream
But she too jealous nickaleas
Sort of ridiculous with the liffa kickin' it

We can never be inconspicuous, my bitch
Rolls with me, it's so sickly in love with me
But she give me Felicia 'ol hickeys
But go get me in the wee hours to get me slow quickies
So sticky, roll with my homies she so shifty, my wife

Married a monsta, carried a youngsta
Said if you cheated, it will come back to hunt ya
She said my filthy world, makes her wanna hurl
And that's my first verse, my wife, my bitch, my girl

Daddy told me that she wanna control the chick
She gotta go blow her grip
Because it's all on a bitch

One is no trip but two had just mo lip
But three I can't cope with
My wife, my bitch, my girl

Daddy told me that she wanna control the chick
She gotta go and blow her grip
Because it's all on a bitch

One is no trip, but two had just mo lip
But three I just can't cope with
My wife, my bitch, my girl

Got a nice anus and it's right, ain't it?
Can't really touch it durin' the day but in the night, tame it
Usin' fight language when she take inches
Great bitches gettin' busy on the weight benches, my bitch

Got a big butt, a big slut who get bucks
You might look up and get your chick sucked
'Cause she's bi sex, keep her thighs wet
Spontaneous I don't know what we gonna try next, my wife

Go a ghetto booty like Naomi, I'ma tell you like Jayo say
All my bitches havin' fancy dreams
And all my bitches wearin' apple bottom jeans
My wife, my bitch, my girl

Daddy told me that she wanna control the chick
She gotta go blow her grip
Because it's all on a bitch

One is no trip but two had just mo lip
But three I can't cope with

Because it's all on a bitch

One is no trip but two had just mo lip
But three I can't cope with
My wife, my bitch, my girl

If one's trippin', the other's for fun flippin', you coo
She run's limpin', you end up with funds missin', you foo
Come wicked your women become vicious and cruel
Dump checkin' to [Incomprehensible] with some check's and you lose

Out of balance the playalistical values and lyin'
I done challenged the way of mystical powers and [Incomprehensible]
I can silence an egotistical chick in a fight
I'm defiant with an evil twist my girl, my bitch and my wife

Ain't no bitch on this planet that is a match for me
They get sick and they stand it 'cause Nina packs the three
Have to be, crash to see if natural cause a catastrophe
Exactaly, my wife don't like me, my bitch get's hyphy, my girl

Might knife me twice just to spite me, my wife
If I break her heart, my bitch
It'll rip her apart, my girl
But I'm the smarter y'all, my wife, my bitch, my girl

Daddy told me that she wanna control the chick
She gotta go blow her grip
Because it's all on a bitch

One is no trip but two had just mo lip
But three I can't cope with

Tech N9ne,"In a world of misery
Within this, three planets collide
Brotha Lynch, Dalima, Tech N9ne
Bring you along for the ride

Wait a minute, I’m from the West Coast Conference
Like Kobe or James Worthy
You could just call me the King of the Valley
All I need is a game jersey
Nigga nuts and guts get served up
When I get it, I’ll spit enough, aim sturdy
Cut it up, gut it up, with colds cuts
And in a oven I’ll heat it up, came dirty
I be off’a that Crip tonight
Turn ‘em into liquid ice, paint his jersey
Leave ‘em in the back of the alcove
Like Helter Skelt’, stick it to ‘em like velcro
Nigga, I’m a bitch killer
I’m a dig a ditch, quick to rip ya
Paint a murder picture wit'cha
I’m a jack knife, strip ya that night
Split your legs open and dick you
But them quick into rippin’ your guts
Deep heat, deplete you with the meat cleaver
That I didn’t see you either
Phone call or receiver, court order delete you
Tech ordered the meat, I’m bringin’ the seasonage
And a suicide note, do-or-die Loc
Keys in the backseat, cut necks
Some sexist ‘bout to kidnap Brotha Lynch
I’m neckless, expect this

[Chorus: x2]
(Welcome to my world)
Where hearts are broken, and bars
Are open, potions pullin’ me closer
(Welcome to my world)
Dark’s my ocean, my Ark is floatin’
But not livin’ like I’m supposed to

(Lyrical asylum)
‘Cause I be Dalima, motherfuckers hatin’ me for the longest
Could it be critical ‘cause I’m lyrically flawless?
And if I’m heated I cannot be mentally cautious?
(Diggin' the pain) I get deep peepin’ the flame
Only can I be held accountable for makin’ the change
To whatever regards are gonna be (Insane)
In the middle of a stage, I’m bustin’ like a 12-Gauge
You can never bring it to a nigga that’ll hang you up
Slip a couple millions up in your drink for you
Homicidal with the fully-loaded rifle
An undecided of whether or not I can peel brains or guts
(I get spaced out sometimes)
And it’s like I’m a heathen, whether or not you believe it
Everytime I rap a motherfucker stop breathin’
Have you ever been in a dilemma for a reason? (Nah)
Well, let me introduce you to the crucial upliftin’ future (Indeed)
Recruit you and seduce you to the mutual group of (My friends' souls)
Nigga you better get ready ‘cause
We done put together the fettiest chemical frame
Energetic when I let it, embed it in your brain
Tech N9ne, Dalima, Brotha Lynch like

(Dlrow ym ot emocleW)
(World)

Fight this phantom, your freakin’ family will fall flat
Bunk Bianca's beat ‘em black and blue with a baseball bat
I might be a small cat, but I won’t use discretion
Hit ‘em with a weapon, if he steppin’ with a mall rat
20 minus 11, I make ‘em all scat!
Not prosperous now, Tech’s not with his crowd
He’s lost in his clouds
Rather be off’ed than soft with his style
I got hopes that my life might get better
But I’ve been broke, so I might swipe your chedder
You better get ready to give me, I got a vendetta
Comin’ to get it, whether weed or money, whatever
Nobody said it was gonna be easy, people deceive me
Or leave me in the dark and buried off in Necropolis
One day you gon' see on me TV, you better believe me
Takin’ over this and never the opposite
Rewrite my life, gimme light, inner fight for what’s right
Allah Liberate, Cuidado
151 Rum is how we run from slim sums, then comes Diablo
I need a medic ‘cause I murder energetic
In the cerebellum never tell ‘em I got
One of the worst problems in the Medulla Oblongata
And you ought to go in one hell of a shot!
No more darkness, how did I start this?
Feelin' bizarre shit, like kickin’ your carcass
I am the ruler in my kingdom and my Dark Seas hot
Step into My World and your heartbeat stop!

Thirty-three
Because everybodys heard of me
And if they say that I'm fakin' momma it's purgary
Cause your son comes with thunda now
That's why they wonder why we headline when I'm underground
In this mainstream game
My gang brings pain, to cowards
Said I'm done Calli give me the power
Come on wit it (HAA!)
You industry punks I hope you fakes die
Cuase most of rappers have a queer eye for the straight guy
Was that shit loud enough to hear
Loud enough to eco throguh the city and bust your ears
Patrick tried to sue us for a whole lot of bucks this year
Sell crazy somewhere else trick (Were all stocked in here)

And when we blown up
Don't get to frontin'
I'll get you country boys nuttin'
You can cut us to thirty we stay on for an hour
Cause them heads boppin' in the crowd's ours (ABSOLUTE POWER!)
Main thing is taking over this mainstream
The game seems like they been waiting for a new A team
Ask Busta Rhymes, he said that nobody had the gift like him and Spliff
But me and Tech N9ne, well y'all ain't fucking with

Simply done best to get to get next to it so I repped is all
Grab your breast to this havin' sex next so pop your crystal
Crock ya legs a bit rock ya bed drop them DRAWERS

Because stupid is how everybody sounded
Nigga you think you know me, but only if you knew me
Homie, you would leave me by my lonely
I'm thinking death and destruction
Images of blood and pus and I ain't looking for nothing but trouble
Thinking of murdering you when I'm just lounging
(That's just the devil, just the devil)
Block it out and keep it moving
I'm evil and it's pussy that I'm pursuing
Gimme the Bible, yes I need it 'cause Tecca Nina's in ruin
Mentally I'm fuckin' up when really I don't know what I'm doin'
My tolerance for physical pain has gained rapidly
I'm gobbling more thizzles then thangs but it came back at me
The holy father must have flipped and became mad at me
Because I'm pondering a wicked insane strategy
How to end it all (Yeah), many men will fall (Yeah)
Any sin I saw (Yeah), Nina been involved (Yeah)
You don't really want it with me punk you don't have the gall
The taste of blood on my tongue makin' me want to brawl
No sentimental shit, death is the penalty
For any bitch you try to re-kindle this
It'll get your temple hit
'Bout to bubble, about to pop just like a pimple get
Send it something so insane I'm so not for simple shit
So teeter totter mothafucka if you want it
But just keep it to the left of me, crazy 'til the death of me
Pussy money more money blood and guts is the recipe
Half and hell of drama for Nina is a necessity
Good and bad is fightin' within me and I'm the referee
Shit is looking like it is evil getting the best of me

I'm promisin' you I'm losing it, you don't really want to mess with me

You don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)

And never been dumby
Shit on a nigga when he comin' funny with me

Gimme the weed keys G's
And a quarter pound of bullets with a machete

See I'm believing that people are really angels and demons
Instead of human beings
I'm havin' feelings of wanting to be the cause of you bleeding
Causin' your family to be grieving now your soul is leaving
Entered in my mind the raw holy words and religious battles
Keep 'em mutilated like cannibal over serpent rattles
I'm seeing shadows and bodies swingin' from gallows
As I'm sitting in a circle surrounded by seven candles
My eyes rolls back, I speak in tongues, I bleed from gums
It's time to hit the streets with guns
I'm bustin' seventy shots laughin' as the people run
I plead to be free from these evil deeds I've done
Until the pain coincides with my violence and agony
Oh the humanity, why does he keep stabbing me
But it's me that I'm stabbing, it's self-inflicted wounds
The Hitchcock of hip-hop, the end is comin' soon

You don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)
Make it chicka bang bang (You don't want it with me)

Said I'd be no rapper, but I did work and became one
Now it's a cryin' shame, I'm buyin' things and they got debts they got to pay back
I think I know why my teachers would look in my eye and say that
And whys that?

[Chorus: Big Krizz Kaliko]
Cause I'm a Blackboy
Came from nothing, don't mean my life means nothin'
Made it out the game through the pain and sufferin'
Yall don't think I see them purses yall clutchin? (I do)
See I'm a Blackboy
Scared when you see me, frauds disappear like a genie
Little white-boys want to be me
But you don't want to go through What I go through
True definition of a Blackboy

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
It must be the way that my pants sag
Or the sparklin' diamonds on the watch my left hand has
I know my appearance is looking like I am bad
In your department store all I wanna do is pop a damn tag
Made it honest, that's why the blacks get mad at you
Even foreigners shop and got big gratitude
I make more than you, but you got the attitude
Like I can't be shoppin' at Saks Fifth Avenue
I'm just tryin' to buy my baby some creed spring flower
But they don't know that the Tecca Nina cheese means power
So they look at me like none of my breed brings valor
Thats why when you see us in passing we seem sour
Last time I checked, my power shockeras
I was on top of the indy charts and not a slotera
But I'm the author of darkness and I like the opera
So why when I'm at Macbeth they wont treat me more propera?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Brother J]
Frontline, shoot, soldiers represent that
Frontline, shoot, Grand Verb, it's the snatch back
Head wrapped in the desert, boombox on the camel back
Escape from the clone lab, fugitives spook black
With finesse in you, its the knowledge from way back
The prophet of the page don't eat right till it all cracks
Blackboy rappin' from the pages torn
Street scriptures more classic than the Jimmy Cracked Corn
A spawn of the movement, keep the music movement
So my purpose stays clear and my music stays groovin'
I do it for the real, I don't need Jena Six
For me to know America is still on that bullshit
So people think that black are just ball players and singers
That massa complex is what fuels the street bangers
And street soldiers to stand up
No choice to get it right, so these Blackboys can finally get they man up

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Ice Cube]
I'm a Blackboy and always gettin' underestimated
But when I move next door, I know you hate it
You had my whole family investigated
And when they didn't find no crack, you said I ate it
Uh-uh, a motherfucker just elevated
Over ghetto life that was designated
You see this Blackboy, you know heaven made it
I don't want to go if I got to integrate it
You know pellot boy, be happy you made it
Just take what you got, and stop complainin'
OK, weather man will stop the rainin'
On my people head, and start explainin'
What your people said, believe in the bible
But you still act barbaric and psycho
My name is Ice Cube, bitch, it ain't Michael
I'll never bleach my own skin just to be like you

[Chorus]",Blackboy
Tech N9ne,"I was born in 71' in Kansas City, MO
My momma was a heavenly one, so the fam was pretty slow
When it came to rap and R&B and plenty more
Check it, if it wasn't on gospel, apostle
Or written in the Bible, then it go
So when they tell the baby don't do something then I end up doing it anyway
Like, don't listen to rap, it's the evil music of today
But, I really fell in love with the sound that was coming out form the East Coast
So we got it and twisted it up a bit, now the industry's having a heatstroke
Some say that rap is dead, but when I get the white, black, and red
And jump on the tour bus, do fifty eight shows, then I'm back with a big black sack of bread
Can't believe that that was said, cause I'm here with a stack of fed
And I got it from rap/hip-hop or whatever and I did not have to beg
So, here I stand, the mic in hand with my rap attire
And I like my fans spending grands cause we got the fire
I merchandise like 5 G's every half an hour
And you cry like a baby so your mic must be your pacifier

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
When I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like
Wah wah wah (Crybaby)
When I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like
Wah wah wah (Whatcha crying bout?)

If it's negative, I don't wanna hear it
Eliminating player haters with their evil spirits

I hear 'em talkin', they mad at Smurf and Souljah Boy
They hating big in the magazine, and don't even know the boys
I know the ploy, washed up rappers wanna attack people
Run up to the car, pull out the mac lethal
Man that's a problem with the black people now
What ya need to know is that, in the world there's a lot of dough to stack
And the ones that wanna hold us back ain't been outside they cul-de-sac
Every nigga I know is strapped, rip shows that'll blow ya back
But notice that, I can put it right down to where the shoulders at
Hating on the south? Why? Trippin' off them chips they got
You don't like that it's screwed and chopped
But you wanna get off in they pot
Wanna be MC you talk a lot, up in the spot and you hot
'Cause they eighty fours be poking out
What the hell is you cryin' bout?
Everybody wanna be killa but not for reala
Bout the method of making money you gotta get the milla
By doin' it like I do it do the work and believe in it
When you do it to the fullest ain't no problem achieving it
When I was broke, homie I went for mills
Got on the mic with the intent to kill
Stronger than ever, and you a gimp for real
I drink Caribou Lou, and you drink Enfamil, chump

[Chorus:]

You should be clapping when folk make it up outta the ghetto
Or trailer park, it don't matter even if he black or if he guerro
But, you don't know how to be male
Instead of a Timberland, you probably in a stiletto
Better yet in a baby shoe, jealous or maybe you
Sick of me cause I'm making dinero
And you don't wanna get clapped at
You want a standing ovation? I thought not!
You say you better than rappers on radio, man that's false chop
Try to run up on me, 'cause a benzo will never be in your car slot
Try to step up on the scene, my infra-red beam's right at your soft spot
If you was on TV and balling you wouldn't groan and trip
He'd keep hatred, envy, and bloodshed on his lip
Tech got long cream with chrome things on his whip
?? with a chrome thing on his hip
But just know your hip will not stop the hop
'Cause when you look at the big picture, my block pops a lot daily
So keep on thinking my clock stops the shots
And I can quickly bury you in your Osh Kosh B'Gosh, baby

[Chorus:]",Crybaby

I'ma spitter, you other cats be on littler
That's probably why you just penny pushing and I'm bigger
So you hate on me 'cuz you like paper and I'm gritter
With two Biancas up on my arms like John Ritter

Oh my goodness, is they talking shit again
When I been player on the day I become U.S. citizen
Haters keep wishen, I'ma take a lost but I'm finishin'
Killer but squirer just like Percy Miller no limits then
I aim for digits, 100% of my people came to get it
He used to be bigger but became a midget
Taken out of the game, livin' lame he lived it
So he gotta hate on the next man, 'cuz he don't got the money 
We left him on the bottom, now he the ex tech fan
Get the fuck outta my face, its you mistake I'm getting hotter sit and watch me expand
You take falls I take her and take drawls
And give you the which stall
They give me the mate call ( oh baby )
You yank tall
Love is me, but hates y'all
That's why I'ma take all, what pops in the great wall

[Chorus:]
If fraud is what your selling
Get the fuck outta here
When they lie you gotta tell 'em
Get the fuck outta here
If you steppin' to me wrong
Get the fuck outta here

Get the fuck outta here

I stay in the zone like twenty eights in a baggie
A veteran stands here a rookie niggas at his knees
Grab these shove middle fingers in the sky
Tell it like it is, when I rap so y'all identify
Start from the ground formulate an enterprise
Get outta here before u get punished and penalized
Ive been in fires to stay in this lane hommie
I swear when I rap, I say it ain't a thang phony
I'm icy, I'm shiny tho' I dont' got a chain hommie
Even when inside this booth I keep my thang on me
And when it rains homie, I don't complain hommie
Eliminate the cops so I don't have to strain hommie
I talks a bunch of shit the haters wanna flamethrow me
Rapper ain't got the balls or got a place they aims on me
Get the fuck outta here, tell em wall told ya
Popper a done deal, every one of your soft soldiers

[Chorus:]

I do this for my partner standing out there on the block
And do this for haters on the sideline at night
Despite what they saying I just cant seem to stop
Gettin' this guap, I gotta a lot, partner I'm almost to the top
I gotta cop new watch, fresh grill and new cloths
I'm trying to come back candy low, side ways on fours
I gotta that bread, it be the money ova these hoes
'Cuz my friends be turning to foes, and harsh words lead to blows
They be mad at me 'cuz I'm the shit, while they just shit
And I gotta off my ass and get it while they just sit
They upset 'cuz im getting bread while they layin' in bed
Even tho I started at the bottom I'm a hundred miles ahead
They still be talkin' dime on me try to slander my name
'Cuz I'm the main man, but they wanna watch it change
They hate me 'cuz they hate but please make no mistake
They know me but can't stop me 'cuz I'm Paul Wall the great

[Chorus:]",Get the Fuck Outta Here
Tech N9ne,"Hmmm, I don't even wanna fuckin do this song for real, but I wouldn't be real if I didn't

I be sittin' by myself and I be thinkin' mama what have I become
All I wanted was a family but I when I look I be the only one
Losin' everything but money everybody left and I don't even get to see my young
Only happiness I get is in the studio when I get to do another run
On the road
Doin' shows
Get the woes
When it slows
Gettin' cold
Gettin' owed
But the flows
Gettin' sowed
I been doin' this a minute, but I think I want to end it, 
Cause I think I'm on a higher level when I go
But the music I be doin' it, be losin' it, I'ma make it really tough for me to grow
All I wanted was a family portrait
See my babies on a ranch with horses
But I was fuckin' devil bitches in corsets
I was never really good, then I torched it
I'm sorry Mrs. Jackson I'm speakin' for real
And I never meant to make your daughter cry
But I guess I'm a failure with women
I'm lost and I feel like I ought to die
Feel like it, I'm rottin' away
My life is just off in the gray
How much does it cost I will pay
To lay and be off in a coffin today
I mean off in ashes, this life and after it clashes, if I get blasted,
This is suicide letters all over again I thought that I passed it
But I guess that I didn't cause this one is written and there is no mending
But I broke I'ma a joke when I croak I just hope that I wont be descending
But this ain't a joke I want you to know that tech nina is never pretending
Alone in my bed with a gun to my head asking where is my happy ending
Yea

[Chorus]
Tell me who it is
What about me
Where is my happy ending
What about me
Is this a life worth living
You know how it beacons
But how does it end for me
Will I ever live
Or does he have it in for me
Will this pop before I stop breathin'
Is there light in this dark I'm seein'

Yea
I put my life in this music
Nina is inside out
I set my heart out for people
They know what the inside bout
Will they keep feelin' nina forever this I doubt
Can never cry for help so if you listenin' this my (shout)
I'm searchin' for the passageway to happiness
But I'm worldly so I have to lay in nastiness
Yes this a strange year, worldwide fames near
But the games queer, sometime I feel like I'm Rudolph the reindeer
But instead of a red nose
I stay in my red clothes
And the music they said blows
Is on the top and the cred grows
Can you resurrect a motherfucker that feel like he possess a dead soul
Deteriorates when inferior state almost equal to bread mold
Now as my head goes, wish I could shed those
Because all of the times the nina was shorted, when I bled froze
So now that I'm cold blooded and hella sick is what the med shows
The tred slows and don't even think you revivin' a dead rose
Yea

[Chorus]

Listen
I'm on the verge of insanity but I'm competent
I'm breakin' so I picked this one to vent
The reason I look away when you talk to me my brain is producin' evilness
I'm drownin' in 151 and rum I meant, thats how I feel
I sit in the mirror with this gun and practice how to kill
But I know damn well that the people like me really wanna know how to chill
This is life is bout it check bout a number
Think of all the love I lost
Because my quest is not a meal
I feel like you stupid
Don't talk to me I'm crackin' up
I don't mean laughter I'm full of bitterness and its backin' up
And I live with angels but lately demons been shackin' up
Tug of war with my spirits, see the blood I'm hackin' up
I love my kids and my fans, inside I sob harder
Cause you paid the price for my life and its right like bob barker
And I wont pretend that its OK, I'm no facade starter
So I guess my only happy ending is at a massage parlor, yea

Get in this car. I'm a star, you ain't noticed yet?
Look at these shoes, look at these jewels shinin' on my neck
I strip that denim then I send 'em in the remover denim
And once I get 'em, then I bend 'em, and I can't remember 'em
I stay persistent and consistent when it comes to pimpin'",Let's Go
Tech N9ne,"Damn!
Hey, that's all I'ma say right now
I'm at a loss for words, girl, you, girl, goin' take that bow
You lookin', boy, my lady would hate this
If she knew that I was out with her but I'm trippin' off the waitress

[Verse 1]
Woo shit! Who's this? Baby, why you do this?
I'm sittin' here with another female and it's 'posed to be exclusive
Beauty, fully loaded booty hips and thighs
I want a raspberry lemonade, baby, and whatever yo name is on the side
You speak unique, beautiful teeth I just peeped
It's makin' me weak to the point I can't even eat
Cause you give me butterflies, them butter thighs need to be publicized
A wonderful face and waist that's great and there's no mistake that I love the eyes
Never like them other guys, cause when I want it I'm on it
The way I'm watchin' you feel uncomfortable, don't it?
But I'm thinkin' you should be in movies and this you need to quit
Then suddenly under my table I got a kick

[Chorus]
I'm with my girlie but I'm lookin' at the waitress
I'm at a business meeting trippin' off the waitress
Can't think of eatin', man, my girl will really hate this
I'm sittin' here with her but starin' at the waitress
And I like the way the waitress (work that, work that)
Come get your money, girl, and (work that, work that)
I really like the way you (work that, work that)
Can I get you on the floor? (Work that, work that)
The waitress got it goin' on

[Verse 2]
Take my order anytime, I come here many times
A week so she can give me mine, baby girl is plenty fine
Business meeting, capital grin, was sippin' when she caught my eye
When she came over to us I said, ""Can I get yo number on the fly?""
Smell like no other, look like she strip undercover
Wish I could follow her home and just say thank you to her mother
Another interested brother who'd love to become your lover
Burn rubber to the spot to tell my dogs how much I dug ya
Outta here but I'm not gonna leave this place without gettin' in yo face
I'm not a disgrace so I gotta see how you taste
And I move at a puma's pace
So baby please if you find the time to get up out the weeds
I wanna make you my squeeze cause these other chicks you supersede
I call her waitress and homie, I call him server
The waiter's a bloody murder, I never wanna hear no murmur no further
Cause she's bliss, I'm tryin' to get in yo knicks
I want you so my order you can 86

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And don't be tippin' her below 20 percent
She need plenty for rent, leave her with pennies, then see her vent
To get money's her purpose, you don't tip, go get burgers
Believe her's is for TIPS meaning Tuition Ensuring Prompt Service
I'm nervous cause I'm gawkin mom's curvage
I'm beyond flirtish, us hookin up we both concert it
Where you get that smell from? She would never tell one
But she told me this, she say me she liked me cause I'm well done
Now your girl lookin' real, real stanky, ain't she?
Cause she know you lookin' at the waitress thinkin' hanky-panky
Her attitude is wonderful, even got the strength to thank me
Even though she a single parent breakin' her back but ain't so cranky
I had to make her my girl, now she goin' eat with me
Southern booty, mane, I truly never need to flee
I'm stayin' focused, the waitress got me posted
But damn, look at that booty on the hostess

Make me start a girl fight, better check this bitches' fahrenheit
Blowin' niggas I'm BeBe, see broke niggas I Skeske
I'll choke your head, beacause see they gon' drop you like my CD

To gave you the truth we havin' a ball, there's bitches all over the place
To gave you the truth we havin' a ball, there's bitches all over the place
There's bitches all over the place, why is you niggas all up in my face?
I'm finna flip the script and start trippin' on them like what you niggas lookin' at?
I think these niggas might need some glasses what they lookin' at?
A poodle tuckin' its tail I ain't ever been mistookin that
Plus I can read your game plan like my book of raps
Last nigga that tried it caught a right and then he took a nap
Nigga sleep go night-night, for fuckin' with niggas that fight-fight
And some of you suckers be hatin' cause we shinin' like some bright lights
T-Nutty your street buddy, Tech N9ne and the clique
They better act like they got system, lookin' at me and go get in a bitch
That nigga ??, flipped a script and my nigga bow down
Straight from Cali with a .50 cal wow, ask around and they tell you blaow-blaow
Ain't nobody trippin' off of you, I just wanna kick it and be cool
Half of these niggas are up in this motherfucker wanna be part of the crew
Cause they know we do the fool, go dumb and act retarded
Don't ever like to start it, but you can be our target
If I lose it open your mouth, for this thermometer
I'm checkin' niggas temperature, then slidin' off
With your chick and smokin' bomb with her

(Threw her in the trunk)
Was tryin' to smash, get her cash
But her mouth was hella fast, so I threw her ass (in the trunk!)
And even though she had a big plump rump
I threw her in and let the beat bump
(Threw her in the trunk!)

2K11, ridin' solo
In the Benz on twins hella low pro
Slangin' CDs out the trunk for mo' dough
My mojo said, ""a thick bitch"" so I go slow
I pull it over tryin' to get up on her bumper
Wantin' to crunch her so I said, ""baby my new CD is a slumper""
It'll make the trunk thunder, girl your rump give me lumber
Up under the sheets I can put you in a real deep slumber
But she said fuck Tecca Nina didn't feel her
Did everything within' my power not to kill her
Disrespectful bitch I really wish that I can grill her
Light on my head that said put her in the trunk man you can steal her
I put the hater bitch in a head lock, she flippin' out
I pop the trunk she crunk but I ain't 'bout to chicken out
I'm sick and tired of bein' nice and lettin' shit go by
She said fuck that Tech N9ne bullshit so I

[Chorus: x2] 

I'm bumpin' everything that beat like gangsta shap
I bangs the rap, in her ear 'till she gives thanks to that
Never take a prisoner where you hang your hat
I'mma roll around with her in the trunk
Poppin' that Tech N9ne slump 'till the little bitch faint collapse
I'mma roll to Topeka
Tecca Nina'll reach her if I gotta double back to Eureka
Crispy flows through my tweeters
Bumpin' this ring when I roll through atita
Wait a minute I think this bitch is trying to kick a hole through my speakers
Get my gun then I open the trunk and said

Get out the god damn trunk, get on the ground! Take off your god damn belt!
Put it 'round your anckles, I'mma tie up your wrist myself!
I just wanted to drink and show you what the dong'll do!
BITCH! The hell wrong with you?

Eyy, the hot sex was not slam dunked
Rolled for hours then I stopped right off Van Brunt
When a bitch talkin' crazy like a lost man's chump
Short say ""I throw a bitch in the god damn trunk!""

[Chorus: x2]

Hours turned to days, days turned to weeks
Had to drill holes in the trunk so she can drink and eat
Whatever I stuffed through the holes hot dogs and ho-hoes
Kidnapped on the low low, spoke no mo' oh no go slow, there the po-po
I gotta ditch this bitch with the quickness
Man I just remembered this benzo is lifted
From Swope Park, that's where I'm 'bout to go dart, let her know art
For the evil bitch and the brainless witch with no heart, it got so dark

Police are still looking for 21 year old Crystal Nelson
Who has been missing since last Sunday
Friends and family told police that they thought this was
Yet another one of Crystal's weekend excursions
But after all this time, they're still worried sick

It's been fun momma, fed her my catalog like Adderall
Fucked up in the trunk with rump is how I had her y'all
In a ditch, walked back to the trunk, wicked is how I sounded
Whispered, ""Bet that you love Tech N9ne now, bitch""
(Threw her in the trunk!)

Uh-I think I've found the missing Mercedes here in Swope Park-uh
In a ditch near shelter five
Uh-it appears the car is still running-uhm
Music still playing

Let me turn down the music

There's an African-American

Delirious
It could be the girl that's missing from last week

Tech N9ne,"Mhm, okay
I hear you
No
Yes
I'm your servant
I have the plan
And I'll give it to 'em
Like you told me to

Wanna live in my world you have to have a Tech tat
Preferably the number N9ne and you gotta get it
Where the back of you neck's at
That'll let me know that you rep that, plus get you out of a death trap
You need it for living cause I'm the king
And I'm giving you the permission to get with a no stress pack
Novus Ordo Seclorum cause the old world orders' post mortem
Disfailure, inhaling sailing delta
Watched it swell and swelter
'Till there was no male in shelter
Yes I'm the one that provided ya shell in hell and held ya
When your politicians were welters
So I built this structure just to help ya
So the communists can come and quell ya
They call me the King of Darkness when I offer you no pain
Why would they label me heartless when your love is my cocaine
And your soul is my rogaine, I have a thirst to know your brain
When you enter my domain gotta take this number for your name
But you don't have to drink cyanide, I'm gonna be right by your side
If we gotta take that riot ride on the enemy and defy your side
Fight for the place we're building
For the reproduction of more children
Trying to get that number back around 6 billion
I'm gonna rule until then
Founded this colony like a pilgrim
Anybody try to penetrate this section or threaten we KILL THEM

What if, he is, what he says he is?

Stay fit n' way driven paste it and dye it
I am the king killer captain crazed frigging pilot
Giving you these khaki pants and white shirt
That's what you wear on my Earth
Eliminating your eye thirst to have any kind of desires
To envy material or admire, my way will extract any type of divider
I'm offering this wider Understanding of life and tiredly
Blissfully vading friction and fire, cha
The number N9ne will get you food, even get you tools
To build anything your family choose, but within my rules
All white shoes with red strings for all my crews
That lets me know you Tech's people listening inside my pews
All your dreams and aspirations, this is the affirmation
That you can reach 'em and my world is not a disaster waiting
The ruses and lacerations no chooses of aggravation
I'm just try'na rehab a nation from exasperation
It's not an exaggeration, I'm something more than your blood and gore
On a level higher than devils or that of Satan

[Chorus: x2] 

When I did ""Anghellic"" I was good and bad, straight confused
Then an angel turned to Devil Boy when the Reparation blew
Them demons had ""Absolute Power"" when I drug abused
So the angels searched through the ""Vintage Tech""
What they found was the love was through
Then an accident would happen that made life necessary
So now receiving God, the angel was ""Everready""
But the Melancholy strikes, the eleven angels mommy's life
So the Misery sat in the angels now becoming ice
As mom got ill and iller, when it hurts her he can feel her
To the strain of the pain made of bane
There's no more angels straight up KILLER!
My apologies, it's not very God of me
To go crazy and try to teach the whole world ""Sickology""
I was then split in two, back to the beginning view
Angel demon cause the killer showed me death was overdue
But I gotta live for my kids, all the evil stuff I did
Taught me to teach you, you can love then no matter how much sluts you did
Or dug, you met my demon back when I had that grudge
But I gotta let you know most of my spirit comes from up above
I'm mostly angel, and you know sometimes we fall
Living under God and I hope he's listening when I say I love you all!",K.O.D.
Tech N9ne,"How could I be so down at a time like this, when I'm high like this?
On the billboard charts, many major tours overseas, when I fly like this?
I've been thinkin' about the people that need me
They needy and all of the pain that I might miss
Sooner or later it seeks me, reach me
Then bleed me deep in the rain inside my pit
I'm goin' down now, because my mom frowns
In a research psychiatric center without her son around
And I'm deep off in this hole, when I'm out here rockin' shows (They say)
I should be hyped cause my life is so rock 'n roll!
But I feel like The Grinch mixed with Ebenezer Scrooge
Let the fever ooze, up out of me, clouded me, never eager to, let up
When I'm in an interview, they probably thinkin' they gonna hinder dude
'Cause he be lookin' like he might offend the rule
Never intricate to remember blues
Because is always right here, with the Hennessy and light beer
Let it enter me and fight fear, yeah
I know I quit, but I started back, the homie caught a gat
And my bodyguard Nicholas just had a heart attack

[Chorus]
I'm sinkin' again, I'm drinkin' again
Drownin' and wildin', you're breathin' again
It's easy to sin when you're bleedin' within
Needin' the grin, cheese and recede in the spend

That's how I feel in the morning

That's how I sound when you're callin'

I'm sorry, but I'm feelin' lower than low!

My smile is forced, my style is warped
Morale is corpse, now that my really good pal is torched
I'm just gone with the wind, I'm home with the gin, to the dome when I spin
I'm a zone cause the phone must be roamin’ again
Another tone, I'm alone now, don't want me to spin
Time with I’m just mind this, might find Miss Nine missed
I find my mind in this line dish, dine quick, not even a second for mindless
In the middle of a time when the music's flyin' I've depleted my kindness!
Low like the grasses, low like poor folks on grass shit
I'm so below the casket, ragged pulse of the maggots
Why do I feel this illness?
I'm lookin' for somethin' to come and kill this a little bit
I got my head in the hills cause the real shit is
Momma is sufferin', takin' pills with the stillness
And I feel it, I can't shake it, in any case my space is the basement
I can't erase my embrace of encasement
I'm chasin' hatred, my taste's not complacin'
So as I go to the flo', the industry finally opened the do'

I wanna be with a woman and just This one, but the taste of blood is still on my tongue.
If I could just eat food instead of her D boobs, I want this one alive when the morning comes...

I just want to be a normal boy,
Just wanna be a normal boy.
If I only could just keep the women off my tongue, then she can be my number one lady.
I just want to be a normal boy,

If I only could just keep the women off my tongue, then she can be my number one lady.

Oh please, oh please, oh please
Just give me just one more clit,
One more tit,
One more bitch.
What does I gotta do to get me fixed?
Cause I gotta have this one in my mix.
She's so beautiful I would slit
Both my wrists
If she split
When she finds out that I'm so sick.
I eat women.
I really eat women.
They're really delicious.
I gotta be knowin' so I can make her the Mrs.
I gotta date with her so I can tell her my wishes,
Even though I'm a beast but she don't know that I'm vicious.
So I meet her at her place and she's so sweet.
Made me dinner but really want her meat
From her cheek,
Maybe her feet.
I'm trying to be discrete,
But I really want to eat
Her out completely.
Teach me,
To keep it away from her,
The eating and tape on her,
The chewing away fingers.
Once she feeds me I'm lovin me tasting her.
Can I just have a normal night?
I just want to be the man to live normal life
Normal wife
Keep her in the formal white,
But the psycho creature with the horn will bite.
It's almost sun up now.
I'm getting done up, wow.
Fellatio.
But I found out she was insatiable.
She wanted me to do her too,
Don't want to see me through her view,

Started doin' my deed,
But then I accidentally chew her out.",Pinocchiho

She been through trauma, more drama, the dawn is gone, it's more tinted

How come an angel gotta be sick in the pancreas like she an atheist?
Maybe it's the faith that is making this lady
And crazy has made me this skeptic, next threat is lupus on top of epileptic
Never rested, psychiatrist forever tested, reverend blessed it

A youngin', all I could do is stare at it
Seizure after seizure, if I was you
Wouldn't never let it be heredit-tary
If Aar' get it, I swear that it's scary
Sittin' in a insane asylum
God or God's ghost, man I aim to find 'em
To take away all of this angel's pain inside, come rain
If Momma go, how come I can't deny them?
And she only 54 in a ward, watchin' her war
And it's more blood and gore, and she tore cause people are so deceivin'
And I'm on the floor, cause with nor Lord this war absorbs more poor
Havin' all the soldiers screamin'

[Chorus]

Think of how all the victims of Katrina feelin'
They need a ceilin', they say that Mother Nature, she the villain
I plead a million, the bible, I read a billion, still I'm free to see the real
And my feet are grillin', cause hellish heat is buildin' up
Think my momma ain't ill enough? It's killin' us
I will erupt if they're pillin' her false, still ain't no healin' her
I been searchin' for answers, but I find nothin' but Mansa
That puts a damper on the current problem at hand, bruh
Or whatever it is, I will never forgive
Anybody who take Maudie better get her to live
She's so sick that it don't matter how much cheddar I give
To the thing or the lady, here's a letter to his
Majesty, why ain't you stoppin' these tragedies?
My mother's glad to be with you, but her life's been a raggedy one
What's gonna be done? In two thousand and twelve when hell's gonna be
When the Earth aligns with the sun?

[Chorus]

That's why I be lookin' for ghosts
Somethin' supernatural, only thing I know is supernatural is the rapper
Maybe if I saw something like that it'd make me change my life or somethin'
Now let's get into K.O.D",Show Me a God
Tech N9ne,"I know y'all don't see me on tv
Or hear me on the radio
But you industry brats
Better check billboard and Pollstar
Before y'all get to crying
About who get seniority at these shows
Especially when compared to me
Y'all ain't shit on stage

[Chorus]
I hit the stage
Grab the mic and blow 'em all away (I blow 'em all away)
(superstars), but they know I blow 'em all away, hey

The gig is over, the gig is over (bitty bye-bye)
The gig is over, the gig is over (when a play)
The kid is older and getting colder (many fly by)
But his will hold ya, so listen closer to (a-a)-r-o-n
They dissing and twisting my name
Because Aaron is scaring these glitz spitting pricks in the game
Hit with this gift, everybody get a whiff of this script and it's pain
Gotta talk about the people with a attitude
Hiss me and slipped in my lane
I've been wrecking crowds for a long second now
Got 'em guessing how tech is blessed
And yes, the best in-town rep
On the real, I keep it trill
And when I spit, I ain't spilling about my million
It's the feeling that you get with this underground headliner
Mainstream ignored a bro
And they be petty, so jealousy is sure to show
But they rich and got more to blow
And everything's affordable
But they gotta go before me
Because their stage show is horrible

[Chorus]

They may be platinum
But they know I blow 'em all away (i blow 'em all away)
(superstars), but they know I blow 'em all away, hey

Why you do me like that girl?
You know I love your mama

I just wanted to have a bite with her, or something
Didn't go get up on that show to fight with her, or nothing
It was Keyshia Cole, Eric Benã, Gorilla Zoe, Tech N9ne and T.I.
But Keyshia was acting bia-bia
Why she acting like a (what?), like a (what?)
She ain't know I grab the mic and light it (up), light it (up)
She say, ""she don't know me""
But I'm the number one independent in the country
Man, she the only one acting funky
And the people at the summer jam, they want me
She say, ""she ain't goin on before somebody that's local""
And she went postal and loco
Saying, ""her not closing, is a no-go""
Down talked me real low though
About how she got more doe and just did a tv promo
No show better than the mo. bro with the s & m logo
Damn baby, much success is sitting in your favor
Slam the n9na tech before considering the data
Fans waited, so we went, so she'd get it for later
But frankie said, ""excuse my daughter, she's a bit of a hater""
Damn!

[Chorus]

They may be platinum
But they know I blow 'em all away (i blow 'em all away)
(superstars), but they know I blow 'em all away, hey

Hey, hey, check it
I understand senor already
But in this case, on this show, I'm a top priority
In Lawrence, your minority and I'm the majority
Check it, I was young and broke
But I'd fetch it, if it was freshest
Shelf the store for the Eric B. and Rakim record
Promoters called us and said,
""We got this show and want you to close us""
Ghostface and brother Ali rocking with a band in 'sota
We couldn't wait to see Rakim rock
But he never ever showed up
He swole up cause he didn't wanna go up before us
Man, what's wrong with these people?
Think that the world gotta kiss their asses
Five hundred capacity but you wanna get two hundred passes
Thought it was about gouda
Forty water told me,
""N9na, get ya cabbage, stay savage and ravage the average""
Y'all better hope radio and video
Keep me from slithering, into they circle
I'll change it, that's why they shivering
Rakim the god? he just miss the king's delivering
'Cause they know they'll fall
And I'll blow them all to smithereens

[Chorus]

They may be platinum
But they know I blow 'em all away (i blow 'em all away)
(superstars), but they know I blow 'em all away, hey

Real, real spill, yeah
Baby girl,
I know I ain't the only one that know you could be bitchy
You know what I'm sizzling?
Ol' boy,
I know I ain't the only one that know you could be bitchy
Do your research before you down somebody else

Get off your high horse
Keyshia Cole, get off your high horse
Rakim, get off your high horse
Industry, get off your high horse

Areola, that shirt came off, that bra came off and...so crazy
What a day. What a motha fuckin' day. I tell ya.
Baby, I'm home! Hey, baby!
What's that smell? Smell like..like my baby's pussy.
What the fuck?! (Oh, shit! Sorry! Shit!)

What do you do when you're workin, come home, and I'm creepin' out the back door
Pants on the floor and you're lookin' at her sayin' ""Whatcha doin' that for?""

What do you do when you're workin, come home, and I'm creepin' out the back door
Pants on the floor and you're lookin' at her sayin' ""Whatcha doin' that for?""

VERSE ONE:
This is how it goes when you're hard at work (hard at work)
I'm with ya lady and I'm all up in her skirt (all up in her skirt)
She chose a rapper 'cause this rapper know how to tap her
Strap her down and attack her while you sneak in, watch pornos and jerk (watch pornos and jerk)
And ya can't be mad at me 'cause your bitch wanna ravage me
Got my big dick in her cavities then it's spit spit I'm in anatomy
And ya can't come badgin' me 'cause sick wanna insert half of me
Straight addicted to the master he whips the sticks up without batteries
Poetry in motion
I make her water 'cause I'm a scholar I father her twat and bother her I got her",Creepin'
Tech N9ne,"First entry for Sickology 101, Dysfunctional

Yeah, don't you bring me nothing stupid
If you don't want me to lose it
Step back if you don't want me to attack
I'm a beast, better give me the deuces
I have no tolerance for nonsense, get away from me
Me wanna get dollars
Don't wanna holler but you makin' me
I'm a little dysfunctional
You're the problem, please don't awaken me
And I'm that way cause back in
The day most have forsaken me
La-di-da-di, I'm at the party
On a drunk night with a punk, might dude
Wanna pick a fight because he's sorry
That he ain't Gotti, like I be, cause he
Sloppy, not me, costly rocks be spot free
But he don't know I'm roguish
Surrounded by my soldiers
And they be locked and loaded
Will explode if you can't hold us
And we don't got no scruples
We didn't come to fight and shoot you
But you busters better be mutual
Don't get loose because we cuckoo
Listen, they call me genius, I run the show
Woman be on my penis, it's wonderful
Demons think they the meanest
But I brung the foe on the floor
Little bit sick, don't you know?

I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me, It might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
You could fool around and make me mad
I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me, it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
Might fool around and make me mad
Don't make me mad

Born to hustle, I'm a product of environment
The game done changed, so I've been forced into retirement
But I make moves and I paid dues and I got common sense
Since I can't lose and I can't choose, then I'll come back to spit
I got hit songs but I've been gone so long that I don't fit
Kneeled at the throne, but can’t get on, so I need me a lick
I write these songs but don't belong I'm on some other shit
I'm huntin leads in desperate need, I hope it's comin' quick
I'd wrap my brain to find a lane that's gon' bring me some change
But it's so strange, my life has changed and I am not the same
I come around but since I'm down, it feels uncomfortable
I try to hide it deep inside but I'm dysfunctional
I never learned to hold it in, I gets emotional
First, implode and then explode, I am combustible
So please don't push to play me, pussy, on some real shit
Won't be defeated if I'm heated, nigga, oh shit!

I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me, It might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
You could fool around and make me mad
I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me, it might be bad
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
Might fool around and make me mad
Don't make me mad

I ain't no killer but don't push me
Goody-goody choir boy never been no pussy
Could be carrying something up under my hoody
Krizz would never snap and kill a baller, y'all, or would he?
Now I wanna be peaceful, but I carry Desert Eagles where
Ever black people are, you know how black people are
I peep 'em out, try to stay evened out
Wanna preach to 'em but their evil keep on seepin' out
Emotions get the best of me, messed up
And then y'all get the rest of me
Depressed and stressed, feel like my destiny
I know y'all think less of me, cause I'm always sick
And I can't let it be, pharmaceutical soup be the best recipe
It's gon' be the death of me, I need depakote
Just to cope, while I keep throwin' them pills down my throat
Dysfunctional blunts will do Smokin' Bombay
Can give me Fung Shui, but I wish that it all would go away
Or maybe I should pray for Jesus Christ to just un-pretzel me
Tryin' to pray for change, but sometimes it feel like he lets it be
So I just take another couple doses, probably be fine
But if you get too close you'll find out that I

I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me, It might be bad

Your first lesson given to you by (Mr. Smith!)
KC MO stand up, young niggas represent

Ey, ask me what I wanna be when I grow up, I ain't just gonna blow up
I'm a star I got astronomers tryin' to get a close up
Telescopes and cameras, rappers wanna use glamors
But I'm gleamin' from the planets, homie, mine is called Kansas City
The cloud in my pocket's gotta rain on 'em
Such a star I saw Heaven's walls and wrote my name on 'em
So comfortable at the top I hopped on a plane and claimed Everest
You might as well say the boy is Himalayan
I rent my rooms on the moon, Mr. Smith is comin' soon
The angels feedin' me cereal with a silver spoon
My hair line is Craig Smith Airlines
A ride from Kansas City to LA is as long as a fan line
I'm high as '08 gas prices, my votes are
Twice as high as Obama's and I ain't gotta ask nice
I'm high as Tech's tour bus, the light skinned one
So if you're lookin' for me dog look up and try to find the sun

[Chorus: x2]
I'm in the air
High in the air

KC, Nesto!

Yeah, don't mean to brag but I froze my piece
And I'm gettin' higher then a nose bleed seat
Don't bring her to my session, if your ho sees me
She'll drop dead in the studio like ODB
Yeah, it's the owner and I'm very cool
Plus this weed keep me higher than an air balloon
Copy cat, like what I'm wearing dude?
I'm so fly, I walk around with a parachute
And even rappers lie too
But I'm the only human with an astronaut suit
See yo entire verse? Say that your iron squirt
When you only shootin' in the air like fireworks (Pussy)
If suckers still on that hatin' shit
I'll stuff 'em in a bag like potato chips
I'll bend they ass up like a paper clip
Tech, sign me and see how quick your paper flip

[Chorus: x2]

I ain't gotta introduce myself, y'all know what it is

Why call me underground when I rock the stars?
And even they can't see me with a pair of binoculars
My hip-hoppin' gave a good side swipe to Mars
One-Third an extinction hit, which left the limelight Ajar
You want your scripts to fly, not in my solar system
Cause I'll dismiss 'em like they wished to die
Mack mother-nature and I ripped her, why?
Civilian ladies love me, so bro, excuse her while she kiss the sky
Call me master more exalted than a priest, a pastor
Blasphemy have me blast fags fast with Magma
In the air like Dancer and Dasher
High in the sky, above all mountains off in Alaska
Higher than a million heroin hits if it'll last ya
Super-Celestial when everyone's stuck off in the pasture
The wack, I will cast ya down, below those who get caught up in my Rapture
Don't be callin' me ""dog"" cause I want you to say it backwards

[Chorus: x4]

Your first lesson for today man
That was it, Sickology 101

Let me in the door
You keep sayin' you hear me knockin'
What you standin' there for?
Who I gotta kill or sleep with?
Cause I'm the worlds best secret
Let me in the door
You keep sayin' you hear me knockin'
What you standin' there for?
Cause I'm the one that do that music you feel
But you still review this
Let me in the door

Right now before my goons have to tear it town
We don't wait in line and we don't stand around
We at Club Zen and drinkin', actin' brand new
Actin' like he never seen my face and I ain't got loot
They know I'm Cash Image and I'm with Tech N9ne
And before the club close, The owner gon' respect mine
Spend a lot of money and that's the bottom line
Ten cars on chrome, Plus the neck shine
Baggy jeans on and J's with a lot of bucks
And you ain't gotta know me
You could tell my dollars' up
Poppin' collars in the club, turnin' bottles up
And all the models in the club wanna follow us
It's Mr. Chevy Man, You hear my song playin'
And every time we in the club
We be spending grand's
First deny Tech then deny me
And I was number one on 103 for forty weeks

[Chorus]

You say you hear me knockin'
So why you don't wanna let me in?
But I ain't buggin', So tell the cops to come and get me then
Complain about my shoes, ain't really talkin' 'bout shit
Dude, I spent like three hundred and fifty on this outfit
NV ain't gon' let me in, zen actin' funny with me
What it's gon' cost me, homie?
I brought a little money with me
I don't wear tight shirts, my pants kinda baggy
KC hat tilted, so now they wanna red flag me
I'm by the bar every time, point blank, Period
The door man hatin', takin' his job too serious
Me, Cash Image, Tech and Kaliko about big business
So what I'm talkin to a bouncer for?
The woman see me, Scream my name like announcers, bro
They actin' brand new this week
So I'm about to go to the block and bubble and get plenty cake
I just wanted woman and I don't like this club anyway
So fuck y'all!

[Chorus]

I get money from music, Kinda like to spend-spend
When I hit the town, I know they gonna let me ends in
But these other clubs be trippin' like I begin sin
You hear me knockin'? (Oh yeah)
Well let me in then
Cause NV ain't so friendly
They got a gay assembly of femmes
Who think the blacks be packin' Semi's
(That's why they don't sell no Henny)
Stink butts who think bucks
But they don't know my bank account is like a Brinks truck
Could buy it any day
Two poin one on a new building and lease 'em and the N9ne has plenty say
The rhyme, it give me pay
So I resign cause NV gay
And plus NV stands for no vagina's anyway
That place, Me and Lil' Weezy-Wee get no love
That's why when I brought Chingy in there
He peed in your club, not in the toilet either
You don't enjoy the beaver
You'd rather plot on how to get below your boy, The Peter
America's Club and Fase 2, I erase you
My pants are too baggy even though I'm clean and I'm paid too
Orlando South's racist, they treated me cold
And Lucky Strike and Power & Light won't let the N9ne in to bowl
Whoa, guess my Dickies the wrong clothes
Play my music but won't let me and my homies through the doors
Over a million records sold, Lot's of money to fold
They should let me in any club in KC, MO!
And I'm the biggest tipper, bartenders know me well
And waitress's love me, so club owners go to hell!
You got that blow to sell but you want this bro to fail
But it really ain't me 'cause it is your destiny to go to jail
And when you're though servin
You might see work on Club N9ne
When you walk up, you might be hurt
You might skeet-skirt cause you ain't gettin' in
If you ain't got KC hat and a white t-shirt, aye!

Tech N9ne,"[Tech N9ne]
I used to press my Dickies with Stay Flo
Sold pieces for my reli, chasing peso
Now they want me with nothing cause I let my pay show
So I hop inside of my Mercedes and let the bass go
On you hating ass niggas
I deserve everything I get, A creating cash getter
I ain't putting the 2 on the 10
I'm making vast figures
You fags bitter, mad
Wanna be faking class with us
How they thinking they gonna come and conquer us?
Little Mini Cooper hating on a monster truck
Ponder such, I'll have you up in yonder, stuck
Not a nare nutta brother stutter that conjure a,
Nothing, nothing, The Ruger's penetration
Inside of ya head is what's sounding like it's bassing
Boom, Bing, Bang
All you haters in the game, Strange lane taking aim
Ain't a damn thing sane, I get it in
Want some drama? Well I can fit it in
We can make it so you're no longer a citizen
Suction from beneath you
We just a little dust'n
All because I'm bringing the bucks in

They wanna leave me with nothing (Huh uh)
But they ain't talking about nothing (Huh uh)
So I ain't tripping on nothing (Huh uh)
They come to get me, I'm busting (Uh huh)

And on the late night at Ms. White's

Then one night, We came up with Vill
Young thugs dump drugs
Nigga hungry for meals
Young thugs jumped blood
Nigga itching for kills
Shit was real in the field, man
This shit was too real
Lost my homies to this shit, man
This shit is for real
But nigga, Nowadays the streets
They go hard on the hustler
All these pussy niggas lacking
So us real niggaz suffer
Not plentiful for me no more

Pour some whiskey, Party with me
Tell the Feds if they miss me

All I do is sell dope and nigga talk bricks
Talk with bananas and talk clips
Ride around and smoke kush with the yurner on me
Drink them champagne bottles with the flower on 'em
All that talking loud will get a nigga a hit
You see them cherry red chucks?
Yeah, I'm with the shit
Anyway I bounce out, man
I hit 'em up and I'll lock up with you
We could get 'em up
I still wear a gold grill, 10 across the bottom
They call me 19-5 cause a nigga got 'em
Click-Clack, nigga
Yanka get yanked on
There's been a lot of hating, nigga
Since I came home
Anything a nigga do, homie
It's Federal and come with football numbers in the level 4
They wanna bee a nigga dead, man

But the name of the game is to have fun

Tech N9ne,"[Intro - Chopped and Screwed Voice - talking]
Hey, now everybody sit down and shut the fuck up!
Class is now in session
If you came here to hear that lovey dovey shit - get the fuck out!
If you soft and scared of hardcore shit - get the fuck out!
For those who love raw shit - welcome to Sickology 101
Your instructor for today is - Tech N9ne!

[Verse 1 - Tech N9ne]
This is style I use pitch, to catch and seduce chicks
To signal the true sick, mellow tone is what you spit
Switchin the pattern, bust out that quick midwest chatter
Some people hate but it ain't matterin, but the people gather, it's flatterin
Switchin the pitch, mixin, there's no need to be stiff in this bitch
Spittin full clips on a mission for bliss when I be rippin this shit
Make it excitin, got to be invitin when you're writin your piece
Never be dick ridin, if you're goin to be bitin, you're ignitin the beast
This is melodic, melodies, if you got it
Mix it hot as tamales, you singin off-key is garbage
If you can't keep an octave in a pocket, you need to stop it
Have confidence, speak with conviction, don't put 'em asleep when you rock it
This is harmony, Nina's taking you through it
Make it buttery, utterly beautiful, make it fluid
Sickology 101 is in session, I thought you knew it
We murderin motherfuckers in music, that's how we do it!

[Chorus]
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)
Such an oddity with it, this is Sickology
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)
GET! (ON YOUR FEET!), UP! (OUT YOUR SEAT!)

From our west coast instructor - Crooked I (Crooked I ...)

[Verse 2 - Crooked I]
My killer Daytons can keep me crushin the competition
Comin correct when creatin the crazy composition
Cannibal character, Calico carrier, got a crooked copper missin
Cali killers on candid cock emissions
That was constant consonant wordplay
Wordplay rhymes with Thursday and thirsty - if I'm thirst-ay!
I change the pronunciation of words, per se
The English language got to do whatever my verse say
So if you want to learn to rap, this is how (this is how)
Right now I'm puttin swag in my style (in my style)
It's a emphasis on the simplest sentences
Then I give 'em charisma with a laugh and a smile (and a smile)
If you want your verses to cost higher
Then your similes got to be hot as a live wire
You need some better metaphors
For example, this song is a war zone and you listeners in the cross fire

[Chorus]

From our east coast instructor - Chino XL

[Verse 3 - Chino XL]
Everybody start lockin their windows and doors, Chino might get in
It's like light-ning, how I'm strikin a triflin rifleman
Bullets flyin up and I'm numbin the bum, like it's Vicodin
So much metal in his spine, he could get rich from the recycling! (yeah!)
Chino be curdlin blood, don't get burned from the buzz
I speak with conviction, like what Da Brat just heard from the judge
Bludgeon no love, industry hate me yo
I'd rather hear Hannah Montana, than half of you rappers on the radio!
Startin drama with Chino, God forbid
Auction my lyrics on eBay, that's God for bid
Problem is lyric Jesus is more than a man
With a sick delivery, like I drive a coroner van (damn)
I'm demented, spittin writtens as sick as I can
Grenade grippin, fittin to detonate Disneyland
I am teachin Sickology, try to follow how every punch line hits
Like Chris Brown's fist in the face of Rihanna

[Chorus]

Yes I got to be vicious, this is Sickology

[Outro - Chopped and Screwed Voice - talking]
For those who don't know what the fuck's goin on
This is Sickology 101, you punk motherfuckers!
Hahaha, let's kill these niggaz

When you met her

Now she's callin your crib, at nights so sick
Wanna pop up and try ta fight your chick
Lorena Bobbitt, Told her to slice yo dick
If you Ever break up with a Psycho bitch

[Verse I: Tech N9ne]
Don't give me that shit
But a nigga don't care, never could it be fair
Then I was up in a middle lover
Came a double dare when
I woke up
I was in a Mutha fuckin nightmare
How you ganna fuck me on Sunday
Then you wanna say you love me on Monday
You buggin,
Thinking everybody gotta bow down because your off in your lovin'
If your on your telephone
And then she lose it when you use it
If sleep, don't leave it on, nigga, for true she will go though with it
She call a bitch back from your phone and chew the chick a new uterus
Even if that situation not lewd the bitch is ludicrous
Bad when you gotta better bitch around
Sad cause you never wanna kiss her now
Never would got up in the women
If I knew about menace
And now never wanna take her down
If she take her seroquel, and selects
The bitch would probably stop and then try to catch yea
Slipin with a beauty itchin to get chya
You betta hope you neva leavin the stretcha
If you with a psycho
Don't go thought with it
Be throught with it
Right in the midst of happiness
Her mood will switch and ruin it.
You thinking you know women and your just so intuitive
Bet that a nigga,

At the end of this
You will have to shoot a bitch

My name is too gangsta huh, hahaha
Man, Stragne Music we got this baby

Red hair, red everything
It's Tech N9ne baby like it or not

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Never been a harder rhymer in my region globaly that's holdin' me I'm totaly hard and bossed up
Why you think the majority of the rap musical authority sword me and balled and crossed 'em
Cause they don't wanna let the crazy kid in then
Spit his hiems speakin' a grim religion
Of rhyme, forbiddin my hisems are hidden
My mind, to written then spittin' the kid in
The N9ne, is playin' you, slayin' you, sprayin' you, perminitly delayin' you, swayin' through
It's the gay in you that's hatin' who somethin' that hella beyond that does
(I love Kanye, his shit is bombay, but I'm rough)
And you can see it in my retina
That I won't be lettin' ya
Threatinas better respect Tech the messengas
Too dope on this to be
History listen this is a mystery
While they spittin' and dissin' me

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Big Krizz Kalico]
This is me (this is me)
I'm a king, I'm a klown, I'm a G (I'm a G)
I believe what I want
Got you singin' my song
But your seein' me wrong
So what's a matter with me?
This is the belief (the belief)
The religion has arisin' from the deep (from the deep)
Darkest prison if you listen you will see (you will see)
If colision your decision you will reep what you so forget what you know this is me

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
This is Tech bra
For years I've been the next to collect a plethra of checks lets get extra
Is what I set ta
Travis let's go select the baddest rappers infect the planet leave 'em in exta
See I'm a vet the powers don't really wanna let the best
Come and wreck the sets and test your sector
Instead of rawness like Inspecta Deckta
Eldest rather set they specs on Mason Betha
Slept on my records
If you knew my musics hanibal lecta
What the hell you callin' for Masta Flex for?
Don't pester me I won't sweet you be on a quest to
Investagate your techma respect the
Shockra tease in hop to these
Hot degress me and Mr. O ahpotraphe
Never listen to these popasees cause they suck!
(I love 50 Cent he gritty went he vent but I'm rough)
And you can see it in my demeanor
The Tecca Nina will blast arenas
The grass is greana
Made it ma to the top of the world
Kiss me, miss me (This Is Me)
Can't you see?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
The industry treat me like a ride on the short bus
That's why I'm tellin' they youngstas when your retourt cuss
And make a fort fuss
Cause you went out on Sam Goody on F.Y.E. with they money and you support us
Strangas, Shadys, Psychopaths and Juggalos
Loseas, Shootas, College women and gutta hoes
Rock it from prescios doe
Drops it just lets it flow
Cop it don't knock it you block us stop at the record store
This is Aaron Yates thizlely in rain
This is for little Donnie this is for all ?? pain
This is, for the sickness of Marty Sue
This is for all the ?? Lou
This is for Ike and Ricky
?? Rhonda, Barbra, and Marla really
This is for be'zle and I know that rest of my family is with me
This is my friends, this is the end, this is a G

Tech N9ne,"Ain't nobody better we comin' clever than ever goin' head up with competitors and levelin' a,
We put em through the shredder we got the lever to sever any bretheren who steppin' with the devil an a,
I'm sick of everybody thinkin' they ready for the work of a killa and fillin' they illin' not sayin a thing,
Gotta get it up the skill is incredible death is inevidable if you got trouble obeying the king,
I guess when I bust I'm too much for ya,
I cuss when I must I'm too rough for ya,
Tecca Nina when I'm flowin It's a rush for ya,
Other rappers on the planet you a customer,
'cause you buy it and bite on me put your recorder right on me 'cause you really ain't no shit and you stuck in debris,
Now the people got the light on me I'm about to fight on the mic and you knowin' ain't nobody fuckin' with me,
Automatically haters be mad at me when I be rippin' it niggas get to trippin' 'cause I'm livin' it up,
Got the industry in the palm of my hand and I promise I can?t offend a fan when I say I'm not givin a fuck. when I sing I'm not givin a fuck,
I'm 'bout the music and doin' it when the people they ruin it when the listen it be drivin' me crazy,
I'm different people they call me evil and devil Imma let 'em see the level of animal it made me,
'cause I don't give a fuck I just bust your crew up,
Leave 'em in the dust n must chuck the juice up,
Nina, Krizz and Kutt we upchuck the new stuff,
Never can ya touch or crush us we TOO MUCH,
",Too Much
Tech N9ne,"Yo, what's up wAnnotatehere you at? (Leaving the club)
Meet me at the crib baby (Alright)
How many you got with you baby? (Three)
Alright we gon' party, let's go! (Alright)

*Phone rings* (Hello?)
What's up, where you at baby? (Leaving the spot)
Meet me at the crib baby (Okay)
How many you got with you? (Four)
Alright we gon' party, let's go! (Let's do it)

After the club we usually go straight to Chubby's
That's where the 3 in the morning grub be
And even though Icons is lovely
Tonight the pad is gonna be a must see
'Cause hussies are coming to give up they pussies, trust me
They comin' to muff me, plus three:
Makzilla, Irv and Big Nick we's 'bout to bust V
Open until we lust free, she sucked D
Gushed me, then roughly rode this ding-a-ling like a Huffy
Luck-ily, another 36 cup D abruptly, came into the room to fuck me
She said, ""Tecca Nina touch me, your dick is thick and husky
It must be like a ride at Cedar Point in Sandusky""
Well, what do you know, baby girl rushed me
The TNA was so silky and fluffy, unjustly I crushed, B!
And not one of these broads is ugly, 'til the next morning
When they crawl in they hubby Snuggie, looking rough as rugby

[Chorus]
Yeah, we hit the spot if we choose her
Then she dipping out
To take her to my house (It's the after party)
We can all (Get naughty)
And take our clothes off

You can take the under-route
Tell your man you at your mama house
No but really (It's the after party)
And we all (Get naughty)
And take our clothes off

Full of that liquor, ready to stick all this dick up in a-uh
Bitch out at Nina's, I never seen but I'm fixing to fuck
Already popping I'm running late, but just minutes away
Was told to grab condoms from up at Wal-Mart and bring 'em with me
Soon as I enter, my cock's attending a chicken brigade
Somebody's pussy's about to get cooked, rather chicken filleted
Found me a victim, we made our way through the kitchen escape
Into the garage and the lip massages was about to began
Lethargically sucking, hardly fucking with Pinky to me
So I told the slut to hike up her butt and let Kutt intervene
All in her guts in between, the Benz and the bucket and screamed
""Nigga you're fucking my whole lining up with my husband to be
Drowning too much and if he-"" shut the fuck up and I ease out
Take off the condom and I sprout on her butt with relief
Just another episode of back to naughty
Tecca Nina I can't thank you enough for the after party

[Chorus]

When freaks come out at night, the freakiest stays out the latest
They hit the after party, they got somebody take care of they baby
So it's cool, no rules, no security guards
Let your hair down, yeah, now do what you want
Man fire up the weed, whenever you please, best believe
That you got the green light, the special guest is me
And we've, been drinking and smoking all night
It's time to find a ho to be stroking my pipe
A bitch quickly grabbed my dick and asked why it was so soft
I said that it wouldn't go off, she gave it a quick blow off
And she did and me dick start to rise
She opened her eyes to a surprise and
Her thighs was moist, it was my choice to go up in it
For a minute put my dick up in it, she said it was splendid
She usually charge niggas, they like to rent it
I told her put it on my bill bitch and send it

[Chorus]",Afterparty
Tech N9ne,"If you at the rink put ya skates on
Roll with the nina celebrate and that the day gone
Just because the DJ ain't diggin and pumpin they song
Mediocre rappers pick tecca nina to hate on
And they do it all night and day long but when they see me that frowned up hatin face gone
Ain't no rah uh reason ya fronted ya should've just kept it one hunit learn how to make ya face stay stone

[Chorus]
Why you comin at me like that, is it cause I came up you mad,
Cause ya see me with all this cash (Keep it one hunit)
Homie it ain't no changin me,
Yeah I'm still the same OG and on my momma I'm always be

I'm a playa, ma'fuck haters, and this a thin line (shit) but thas what separates us.
If they smart, they are the segregaters, team of Kansas city chiefs, wit a ma'fuckin Raider.
Thats a problem in the makin', a problem in the matrix, people thats unplugged (man) would probably be the safest. So understand I hope this hood shit sacred, hand on the bible I shoot it out to satin, if he ever did say shit, I really would be finer, ya you heard me nigga, anytime cuz, still serving nickels, step ya grind up, I knew the game was dirty b'fore I signed up, ya this rap shit is circus full of clowns and, otha weirdos acting silly for the croud, then they think we all the same till my pistols get to plowin, so a hunit ain't enough, gotta keep it one thousand.

It sounds like they wanna claim KC king
They can't advance in this game cause they weakling
When in the trap making penis that can't see things
Like me at marina grog and galey mane feasting
Party of 70 at the (fogo da'chao)
You niggas small time, me and travis mobilin' now
Holding us down almost everybody know what it sounds of
Tecca nina despite the hate you be throwing around
From now on they will not talk nay talk
And they family won't have to walk cross grave moss
I'm the king it because I mob boss pay cost
I pro ball on em they rock chalk Jayhawk
So bow down cause the king gets hyphy
If you slight me ain't no stopping the nina the almighty
Don't you see the snake and bat shining brightly
Keep it one hunit if your rappers don't really like me, fight me!",Keep It One Hunit

Back in the day I had to pay but now everybody say hey!
You lookin good bro, you makin good dough
I be like yo you didn't know? they say

Oh
And 3 more didn't know saying
Oh oh oh didn't now the know now they know they say

Oh oh oh there they go there go they like oh
Now 3 hoes want to go like
Oh oh oh didn't know now they know they say
Oh your girl be like oh oh oh
Now I got it for the night screaming oh

They didn't know I sell out shows in Amsterdam
And in Switzerland
Tecca Ninna spits for grands
She really dont know she about to ditch her man
And give her pants to me cuz this her jam
Damn
Tecca Ninas everywhere keep it necessary to
Steer very clear
If he dare to stare and glare that's very fair
Be drinking, Be merry
Where the ladies with the dairy air?
More black women pooping up at my shows
Like Tyler Perry there
Oh
And they didn't know I won an MTV award?
New York yelling for me like they've seen me before
They know that underground clown come so sick and dark
But they didn't know they'd see the N9ne on 106 & Park
I'm kixin it and the foes can not stop
No hoes can cock block it
My clothes in Hot Topic
They froze when I pop it
I glow in the MO
Throwing the dough
Oh you didn't know?
They say

[Chorus]

Hey yo we kixin it like a Friday night
Even though it's a Thursday
Eyes on us when we stepping out on the curb free
Chickens want the business giggling
Acting flirty
Little momma swallowed all of her vodka
She still thirsty
Probably because shes got something that's mixed in her hand
Straight to the sipper
Or maybe
It's because the reason I got my hands on you
Dancing like a stripper
We super cold head to toe
We sharp as a machete
We the hottest show in KCMO
The new Malcom & Eddie yeah
It's me and Big Yates
He know my spits ate
Shit so sick he got me spitting on The Mixed Plate
Like a disgruntled employee who just quick Gates
You read the front of the fitted homie and it's
KC
Ask who the president and they are going to
Say
Me
And now I'm rocking with the king (TECH N9NE!)
So every time we hit the clubs like a movie scene
Filling them women with their cups with Kansas City Tea
PHENOM!

[Chorus]

That's the noise you make you lady do
Fresh hypemen had me on the turn tables in 82'
Sleeping with women and popping bottles
While he was eating baby food
Murdering raps and spitting facts
Something I was made to do
See I raised a few eyebrows when I started up
Veteran Click gave me worldwide we was hard to touch
Ya'll can start the fuss
And I'm going to close you down
Popping you dick licker
Only when there is hoes around
Oh
That's what your girl be like
Killer city will show what that world be like
My world be tight
But my flows be sicker
Behind the counter and cut you
At that Paul's Liquor
I'm a show me nigga
I rep for the land
I got kool aid pumping through your man's heart
I've been marked
And respect the niggas who've been whacked
Fuck with Tech and Irv at the club and spin racks

[Chorus]",Oh You Didn't Know
Tech N9ne,"Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette, hanging out his mouth he's a cowboy kid

In his dad's closet hidden oh in a box of fun things, I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah he's coming for you

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, out run my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet

He be coming home late, he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice

Tech N9ne,"Tech: Craig you up man?
Craig: Haha, Mr. Smith, it's beautiful night in Kansas City
Craig: I must say Tech, you gotta check this out
Craig: Haha, it's another one
Tech: Shut up nigga you ain't Tony G
Craig: Hahahaha, check it out, uh

Its a hard knock jaw drop life for me
Last year I was in front of mic's for free
Now I'm winning its nice to see
Because if you ever tried to make it out of here, you would know its all bull
And I'mma show them how to steer with it
Had a clear vision head light deer sittin'
Thought it would be easy because Craig's got a clear image
Gotta shift out of gear LeBron James
They know that I'm a king but I remain in the cavalier
I was a rolling stone and now I'm sky-scrapping
I'm hella dope they high from songs im making
Like a Jamaican and I can BUCK BUCK
What was y'all thinking I'm hot for no reason
Summer summer time James lemonade
I'm in season and springing into the rain
You don't wanna get wet in it
I stepped in it
And got respect
And now I ask Tech what's next

[Chorus]
I got my duffel bag, my swag and my A.M.X
I got my girlie all done up for some S.E.X
I got my heat under the seat in case them fools they flex
I'm taking trips over seas, tell me what is next

Ay yo whats next up on the menu
What show? A different venue
When you thought that it was over no sir its to be continued
Too many people know you
Too many bitches on you
So you ditching on the exact same thing you want to go to
From the outside looking in
They don't be understanding
Because from every fan that loves you thats an inch away from family
My name is Obergeek but you refer to me as Grammy
It's just pre-mental planning maybe you will understand me
Started as a local, haha
Now I'm on the vocals lala
The time it took to do this shit was kinda loco
I know
Put me on the beat then I flow
I'm fuckin' with green because I go
Seems like I speed through obstacles like my life's on nitro
I see the light posts I'm speeding through the night glow
My miles per hour says I should be insured for Geico
I took a stop at Ollie Gate
As as soon as I stepped up in the place
He asked me what is on my plate
I said I got

[Chorus]

I'm tryin' to make it so the whole world can hear that
Real raw and severe rap
Television showing how humongous my career's at
Me popping bottles when the enemies watching poppin' beer caps
They feel severe slaps from here clear to Iraq
I'll near trap but this here's cracked
And I get them chicks with their boobies lifted and rears fat
What me and Travis doing every year after year stacked
Then we off in the Bahamas where the peers at cheers cat
And we don't fear packs cause we standing near straps
Come to me with that queer crap you'll get your vaneers cracked
Yeah I might be a weird brat
But I get them tears from your dear 
That'll have her speared in the lair when her brazier snaps
Watch who you sneer at
Because if we see a rat he's smeared flat
He's about to feel snakes and hear bats
So whats next is a mere splat
On her face because the P was shear wack, haha

I'm living like a rockstar (Living like a rockstar)
I'm going to places everywhere you are (Where you are)
I do it just like what you wish that you could truly be (Truly be)
I'm fresh, I'm on a magazine (I'm fresh, I'm on a magazine)
I'm living out my wildest dreams (I'm living out my wildest dreams)
I do it just like what you wish that you could truly be (Truly be)

[Chorus]",What's Next
Tech N9ne,"I see you

I see you looking at me
Looking at me, so I ask

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho

You're crazy,
I like you, but you're crazy, my tours paid me
So I used that dough to allure ladies to whom bathe me
Never know that my minds for sure shady
Pure Hades, rev x steady they couldn't endure to save me
Why did I let this stripper burn me on the arm with her cigarette
In the same spot ten times in a row
When I felt that burn upon the clitoris?
I'ma get her wet, sorry to get carried away,
I feel stupid 'cause I ain't did her yet
Maybe she never let a fine nigga stare at her breasts,
I get vexed but I ain't bit her neck
Open, I try to contain it but that damn dame thang's soakin'
Alter ego say why you let them gang bang folk in
Strange lane hopin' I can maintain copin'
But ain't nobody talkin' when the insane mane spoken
I like fire on my skin, blood on my draws
From up on her walls, I'm suffering, I'm stuck in her claws
Stuffed in her jaws, huffin' and puffin' hollerin' my god,
Afterwards I like really hots scolding water on my balls

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho

Mom? Dad? I'm no longer the boy you're used to seeing
I've changed a lot, plus I've grown to hate every human being
My mood swings have now turned my dreams into gruesome scenes
Now I'm doing things I don't normally do
When illusions seem to be the only pleasures I can gain
Heck, if I was sane I would of put down the mic and say
Fuck it I'll never rise to fame
But with the wicked records I contain,
I could probably jump without your name
No lovey-dovey let's ignite the flame
If you're lucky you survive the pain
Sorry that ain't very marry to say,
Why is this game so scary to play?
Well let me think, 'cause every day
My balls are getting too hairy to shave
Pause a minute,
I'm stressin' the game if I go to hell,
Then heavens to blame
I don't mean to come off crazy
But you mothafuckas seem to think that I'm hella deranged (hey)
When I was seven years old,
I fell on my head and I severed my brain (hey)
If you think I'm lying then
Ask my mama nigga she'll can tell you the same
Should I be ashamed?
No, I'm living my life so ghetto fabulous
Before you get bent outta a shape my nigga let me ask you this

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho

I stab you with this mic
And rap this verse I'm rappin' to you
Matter fact I'm rapping through you,
Never say my motherfucking name
Unless you absolutely have to I am not no fucking jacket
With no matching shoes
And you are not no fashion guru
Can't even see you niggas,
Y'all wish I was rappin' to you
Matter of fact act like I'm rappin' to you
If that gives you passion
To use this as an excuse
Then just jump up out of conclusion
That I'm attackin' you dudes
Is just like old fashion voodoo
Y'all ain't even the shit,
No y'all ain't even the doodoo
I got more flavor on the tissue paper under my toobos
So I'm slapping you foolish
With wooden paddles you stupid
Baby sitting little bastards like little afternoon children
You can call me psychotic
But it's more like schizophrenic
And I can speak can anyone tell me just where my medicine is
Guess I gotta show these minors just what my avenue is
Man I swear I'm all up out of my brain like graduate students
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings
I see your tears, come here,
Give me your face, let me clear it
But I wonder how it would look
If I could peel it back with a skillet
Then I'ma fill it crack when I hit it,
Then I'ma spill it back when you heal it
Damn it Bobby boy, what in the hell,
What in the heaven, what in the earth
Where is your mom? What are you cursed?
Where are you from?
Where was your birth? Where were you first?
Why weren't you in church?
Why is there dirt, all on your shirt?
Man I think that you're going berserk

Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho

Am I a psycho? (psycho)
Am I a psycho? (psycho)
Yeah I'm a psycho (psycho)
I guess I'm a psycho (psycho, psycho, psycho)",Am I a Psycho?
Tech N9ne,"The boogieman

And just when they thought 
That everything was peachy keen
Somewhere deep within the shadows
There were other things to be seen
An untamable beast with an urge to feast
And only alone would he stand, 
the culprit of fear on the 67th tear
There lies, the boogie man.

No introduction needed
N9ne times you must repeat it
Mind trying just to lead it
I'm N9ne, who supposed to be this rough MC
Who's glutton-ny would rhyme grime,
Trust believe it
A legend ever since the projects
Odd tech would get respect when he wreck the set
But never get the props that was god blessed
So this is me, never let the prod rest
The object of rawness inject your steps to darkness
Led the industry to whispering the name
History became a mystery
'cause listeners in the game
Wish to sing the same
Which cerebral glitch will lead to lane
And this will be your pit
For me to split and bleed your brain
They heard the name
But can't put a face to it, 
Oh what a shame
When he rains
And when he stands still, he turn to lanes
From sane to straight wicked, don't tell me you ain't heard the saying
The boogiemans real

[Chorus]
He's underneath your bed
Trapped inside your head
you tried to fight it
But you decided it's just that,
Boogieman
We fear what we can't see
This webs a tangled weave
Laughter inside you,
Tries 'n' blind you,
From that boogieman.
An in that voice you hear
'Eliminate your fears'
What do you do?
Discover the truth
That is The Boogieman
And now you know it's real
And everything you feel
Hits you again, you will stand
Face-to-face with that Boogieman

They don't wanna have to try to do as I do
That's prolly why it ain't been easy for me to slide through
I chew rappers up, on stage and mics they by-Flew,
Out with the ravens, flight to hatin, haven lies you
'cause you don't want change
And you don't want strange,
Rearranging the main lanes to brain games from plain jane
That's when your fames strange
And you can maintain
you think you sang such an insane rain, same thing
And I'm the shadow in the dark
That came for battlin' in the park
And they skidaddled when I barked
That give a rattle to their hearts
'Cause they're afraid they will all fail
Darkness will prevail
The boogieman is not a tall tail

Wat a tough act to follow
you afraid? tell me are ya?
When this came you were nada
Tell your lane sayonara

And one ninety five pound on you niggas
So tall I can't even hear any of the sound you deliver
Me and my partners never see any of the hateful frowning you give us
'cause' we smile at the bitty braggin' wack rapper's
Who happen to be the best at the gat master
But down to the simple fact
Here's a strap past ya ta blast at ya
That after, the gap put him in the casket,
Last chapta, that's laughter
Half past move fast just imagine a black Dracula
Smashin' 'em with a gat to bust atcha

It went to my head as my first time
To be cocky, I'm just a giant when I burst rhyme
My leg is humongous, is y'all's verse mine?
Step on the mic I can't stop my leg like Robert Cline
Giant robot make you feel very low shame

Getta spitta witta bit of bitter marketing'
With skrilla then a fifth of henny liquor, start to twist it
Critics sit and shiver
In the slit of zillas
Pit of killas grittas hittas
Click of silly niggas are fictitious
On top of the game, I'm droppin' the rain
Godly gifted, hop in your lane and stoppin' your fame
Bark is viscous, you got bars to witness
Y'all submissive, when I get your brain your thoughts is shifted
I'm incredible, highly technical nympho triumph, raw intricate
I need medical then more science, scar's 'n' stitches
Alphabetical gems blow by him, pause it a bit

For keeping' rap on tilt
Like drinkin' pathrone and jack prone then yack on silk quilts
Gotta fat dome that'll last long if that's where I'm skill't
Giant, huge, humongous, gigantic, expanded
Been floatin' for years and I ain't landed

Never the one to be stingy I leave my dinner, she winks (geah)
Cause she think she got me and her percentage be Brinks
But I'ma stick it without a ticket in the tender she thinks
Suck me up and then I can become her energy drink (gyah!)
And that's what she gon' need (geah)
Punchin the clock, I'm not gonna be done on three
Baby you probably wanna kick it and get 'er done on E
But you ever have steamy sexual fun on weed?

No I don't look it but I'm the older kind
But that dont mean I'ma stick it and quit it, forget it

Love it when you maneuver your body off my space

Now check it - let me take a little dose of the page
I'm hittin for hours and hours, hours hours and days
All the positions I'm feelin real kinky today

I know you'll be lovin the way you'll throb when you hug it
When I got the punani I thought the job really was it
Before the punani you take the job and you shove it
Feel like a nigga makin love when I does it
On the clock I'ma stop it, when it buzz I'ma plug it

You really be wantin to pack a stud in your luggage

Uhh! Pack a stud in your luggage
Break down baby Stone gon' love it
Finally bang her, make a nigga wan' love it

But I kept you all astonished make way for the kc comet

The promiseland is real simply because I write it.
Don't stare too long and envy 'cause you might get eye-ritis
Now to get me for shows and lyrics it's high prices

Been alone ever since I started
To be an artist
I've been disregarded
I mean the hardest they ever seen
I put them in the garbage to be a part of when I spit this
Whammy is wicked
Face covered up just like Stanley Ipkiss
But damn he is lifted were no families listed
Plan to revisit that big plan that he misses
But the land that he shifted, twisted a bit
'Cause man he resisted to jam when he script it

Ain't none of my homies up here (oh)

But me spittin' these frees and pre-writtens 
Is probably what's gone make mills
Try to stay chill

Fuck the fame and the thrills I'm maintaining the real
Straight up fury ain't no jury minus the chain and the grill
To me, you were lame if you ain't been embracing the skill
Ya see, 'cause I been in it, for a minute, and I ain't gonna go away
Y'all keep them trash rappers, but I'm the one that y'all throw away
Them songs I make will show the pain but this game ain't to friendly
I can't take it no more so sing it Mackenzie and tell em' why I'm

Got everything that I wanted but it came with a price
Bought me a crib with my money, but I gave up my life
Sometimes I stay up kinda late, and I hate it at night
Every other day me and my lady we break up and fight
Thinkin' you bringing that mentality 
Into my galaxy is a fallacy for anybody that battle me
Realizing I ain't got nothin' but friends and family
And after that ain't nobody else gonna look after me

Yeah, Strangeland
Well uh.. how did I get here?
Well that's simple, Mr. Yates
What, do you mean?
You're the creator

What I saw was amazin after raisin up and
gazin at the vapors that I'm creatin, nights and days I'm pavin
the way for ragin, Techaholics, makin havens
Next to all this hate and craze and death, we call it a place of consummation
of perfection, fulfillment, the Tech runs the building
Respect one's resilience, from threats guns and illnesses
This place is realness, it feels as if it's lifted
A bit sick and twisted and real wicked, villages
And I'm the main man, that made every effort to gain fans
Through all my pain I obtain grands
Millions just cause of my brain now my lane stands
Insane rants, the name brand, call it Strangeland

Gettin paid was the gameplan
But the lane transformed to untamed fans
Enhanced in the Strangeland
(Can't live up to them) Pain and insane land
(Wakin up in a) Strangeland
Where everybody know my name man
Cause my blood and veins ran through the mainland
I am in the Strangeland
(Can't live up to them) Pain and insane land
(Wakin' up in a) Strangeland

A world filled with Technicians lets this one
Stress lifting, mesh kids in sets, with them Tech listenin' vets
Expression is best written, less hid than flesh
Women, sex driven, that's livin', yes been impressed
by the way the Tech is blessin' 'em - it shows
cause the land it steady grows, and I'm the man with fetid flows
But understand he said he knows, that he ran a deadly road
but he woke up with a family, bros, in a land of uncanny souls
And they adore him, even if they can't afford him
Be the rich, and be the poor then, really get to be before him
To get laced, on mistakes, and big brakes
Quick pace, lyrics they pick in this place

He played me some stuff in uh, in L.A., off ""Tha Carter IV""
He has a, he has a record on there with umm
this dude named Tech N9ne I don't know if you guys heard of him?
Oh man, he's crazy, he's crazy

Gettin paid was the gameplan
But the lane transformed to untamed fans
Enhanced in the Strangeland
(Can't live up to them) Pain and insane land
(Wakin up in a) Strangeland
Where everybody know my name man
Cause my blood and veins ran through the mainland
I am in the Strangeland
(Can't live up to them) Pain and insane land
(Wakin' up in a) Strangeland

Am I in the Twilight Zone? Cause my mic's on
But I never thought the world would buy my songs
Cause in my land I am the highlight inside my dome
but now it's my height, they try bite, cause my life long
In this hip-hop, everybody's lip drops
When I spit the gift that quickly shifted cause I get props
It's terrific; they recognizin' me on every level if you missed it
If you look you findin' me on the very rebel, this is listed

His own lane had the strain and pain, and that became fans
When all the dames glance, he's doin the rain dance

Tech N9ne,"(You know that there are billions of stars in the universe)
But the star had quite a difficult time shining amongst all the other stars
The year was 1994 when the star began his descent
And continued falling.. And falling...
Landing in an unknown place
The star creates followers from underground rap
On the quest to shoot beyond the stars once again
The star begins in.. Strangeland

Ground zero, crowned hero
But ain't nobody ever heard the sound before
I found me so
Competitive, I never get the credit back at it when it was clown and LeJo
Now we pro, the brown people
Was on it for the moment but they frowned at me fo'
Layin' what I sayin' didn't sound negro
Now people 'round me low down when the beat go
Never will I ever stop or quit what I'm doing
I'm getting better, even clever, rockin' it then I ruin every competitor
We at 'em poppin' shit, I be chewin' 'em up ahead of ya, etcetera the
Speed bandits coming for ya, now he's making an industry sandwich
Come enjoy the flow, we're takin' the minasee damage

We've landed! The stars have fallen from the heavens!
The thoughts will reign on this planet!
The arts been painted on the canvas, your helpless!
We've landed! The arms of fans have been branded!
The dawn of 6's and 7's! Is the start of musical madness!
We've landed!

Shootin' for the stars, lootin' for the cause
Who's inducin' puke and hootin' for the bars?
You get stupid groups of loose and juicin'
You for true, but you recruit the youth ignore bizarre niggas
But ain't nobody fuckin' with any of our niggas
And if you trippin' under the Tecca there are millas
You don't wanna fuck with a murderous gorilla
War 'till the lord hit a scar, nigga, what?
Bitch I'm at the bottom and I'm comin' to get at ya
Better get up in ya column
And I'm gonna diminish you, when I spit I really got 'em
Right in front of me timid, and I want a percentage
Cause I fought for everything I got, it was not handed
And nobody fed a nigga nothin' when I was famished
I'm bussin' for life and not for Nathan, but God damnit!
Notice something beautiful just landed

[Chorus]

I've landed six feet under six feet
But every other ordinary people can't sleep
The badness, we had this backin high school classes
You're dealing with three faces of madness
Never been average with the image of a savage
At the very bottom I'm livin' under the maggots
But I'm 'bout to shoot up and really wake up the masses
Gas it and blast and have the upper class rackin' ashes
Upper class rappers, sucker ass packers
A rougher tougher motherfucker spaz backwards
Kcuf Natas, gutter mad slacker
Tecca Nina's what their lads after
Everybody I wanna say, ""What goes up?""
Vertically movin', I know it's 'bout to blow up
Thinkin' when I hit the stars I'mma slow up? Hold up

Turn out we the perfect strangers, Larry Appleton and Balki
I was out east, when the text came in
With Tech sayin' what is 'bout to be
Before you fuck me on the dough, know that everybody 'round lookin' out for me

MJ, our little bro dropped and that’s why they keep me so blocked
I’m in the star coach now
In the back by myself, I listen to our dope sounds

Kicked it with me up to the 24th, then they go home

Shed tears of lonesome despair in the form of rain
I've devoted my life to rid you of your pain
For feelings of acceptance which reveal themselves feigned
Do not mind that, scream the voices in my brain
But if I stop giving, only I remain
Though I know not of misery
For I lack the company it needs to be entertained
But misery would be a nice change
This solitude drives me insane

Yeah, I think it’s my fault, y’all, ‘cause I’m reclusive
And I’m thinking I lost brauds like Y! Exclusive
And I know that I might fall, ‘cause life is stupid

Cause your lady just discovered that my
Big rubber defies your lover blubber

I'm at the beginning of my hay-day

Deep in my vocals they keep yelling that I'm doper

Its up to me as the guardian to go and solve em'
Make my life and involve em
Late at night when I call em
I like to hear em' say daddy your song is awesome
Instead of gang bangers in school won't let up
I'm fed up I'm wondering if you can come up an red up
You shut up, negativity can be found inside my angels
Even though I was stupid but I put it down
Set trippin' but I let it go headed for energetic flow
When I'm up to know that I was down and out
But now I'm breaded though
I know you saw me rep colors when I was young, dumb and malicious
I'm thankful, that all my blemishes never made you suspicious
Latched on to light
That's known to hype apparent you coherent knowing I rapped wrong to right
Love and positivity instilled in my kid
Their family my family their mother and I did
Discipline starts at home even if they can't stand you
Watch em' fights land, you clock em' right hand
To stop em' that a man to stand up even add a camera
They won't be James Holmes, and they won't be Adam Lanza
A John Malvo, I'll flow loud for my child though
Ain't raising no groucho evil out my house yo
Instead a me watching em' disappear in the night
Air em' at graduation saying that's my kid right there

I proudly proclaim my love
The futures born from my own flesh and blood
All that matters, this time
So my prayers that the sun will always shine
On that sweet child of my mine

To my unborn I give my all so you could ball like I could'nt
Stay in school and play it smooth and do those things that I wouldn't
Pay attention and keep your distance from ignorant instances
Play a instrument anything that you want just envision it
Follow your dreams, no matter what may come or what may fall
'Cause ain't no shame in failing as long as you know you gave your all
Stand up, man up, get a handle on yourself tighten your belt
Do what you can to do for you and ya'll just don't, do it for the wealth that they offer
It sounds awful but if me and your mama' ain't talking
And she said that I ain't offering a call just as often as I should
I pray that you get older and you understand that I was just, doing what I could
If she let me, if you have a second I could explain
Like so many transitions in life that people change
Whether I'm on top soil, or dead in a box
I love you dearly sincerely and that'll never stop
For my kid
For my kid

I proudly proclaim my love
The futures born from my own flesh and blood
All that matters, this time
So my prayers that the sun will always shine
On that sweet child of my mine

And one on the way in a matter of weeks
But it's a shame 'cause I think that my other daughter ain't mine
Andria baby I love you I guess your father was blind
In due time you'll understand it, how your mama' was scandalous
(Wait this don't seem right man, I don't think I can handle it)
When I all I ever did was show love for you
Sweated blood for you, any moment take a slug for you
But its cool, the baby mama drama is expected
And that karma is going to be what I been blessed with
Sit back and learn your lessons as our seeds grow from kids to adolescence
Then present you for yourself as misdirection
The first to heed the message is Malik
Abandoned by his mama' on thanksgiving evening
Bout' three years ago was up to me to feed to em morals
Values manhood, knowledge a week ago he graduated
You ask me, then I'mma say

I proudly proclaim my love
The futures born from my own flesh and blood
All that matters, this time

How in the hell he hovering having hella go H.A.M. Though?
I said to Seven, ""Richard Havens'll be the man""

Guess not, cause he be the guest spot

The beat is the problem
And if ya got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em and I mean a lot of 'em

I've got to audibly body them
And this is it man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And the fans will lift hands, we'll be dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain't ever been a gift for me to heat 'em, I beat 'em, I burn 'em
Then I let 'em melt
They never heard of us, but look at me, I'm turning up
I slap the shirt off a stupid simpleton makin ‘em be impotent
If and when I be flipping niggas be feminine
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I'm living in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast so I smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure
(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half ass delivering I'mma eat your dinner

Wait! Before I wreck this beat, let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills of ecstasy pills next to me
In the seats spilled or she eat ‘em all with a breakfast drink
(You inspect the sink?)
In the habit of grabbing a mic and babbling, I dabble in the Vic's
But I might just swallow my fucking Ritalin tablet after the night
I'm grabbing it right from the medicine cabinet
'Cause that's what it's like and attack it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in my backpack when I write
All this anger pent up inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I'd try to set a big enough fire
That'll trigger the sprinkler system
And I'd escape, but the getaway driver screwed up my limo
Collided with the center divider
I went through the window and ended up being
Pinned to the side of a semi
Offended beside a friend of the guy's wife
Friend of the flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
‘Cause when I pick up a pen I'm venomous
And I'm as thick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist sinister
You've been yelling dementedness
I invented this, I'm the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate
I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy
Envious of female independence
Hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this'll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity

That I'm thinkin' about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way for ‘em to picket it
I pick a day to be picked and I'm picking the wickedest shit to say
Spin it back on a level, incredible, head of a rebel, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away, uh-uh not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake
Eatin' lobster, steak and coffee cake
At a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take like Kanye
Walking up on the stage for Beyonce
Like it's my job to say
That you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition, replenish the Punisher
With his gun at your hundred words
And a clip on that which motherfuckers better run
If you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don't wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the.

I sped up and did it, you tripping to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who's having to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal, we giving the light, a lot of energy

Nah, cause every time I be dropping I get bit

Bass ackwards, synonymous with rappers
All these niggas claiming maintaining that they factors
When you push a package, would you ever clap shit
All these niggas talking ain't done nothing but this rap shit
Reason why I shook this place and had to find some space
I killed one of these rap niggas and ate they fucking face
Outta place in this rap game, biggest mistake I ever made
Hit rewind and de-line, deleting everything I layed
Far from a rap nigga, I don’t lie for fun
Fuck fame, and fuck you, and fuck him, and her too
Nina called the big dog, I had to breathe smoke
But Yo Gotti and Big Scoob and this ain’t 'bout dope?

These niggas ass backwards
She let me hit that ass backwards
Pussy niggas act hard, get killed for bad acting
Trigger man laugh man
It's funny how this shit go
Redrum was the case that they gave me
I sipped slow and stumbled down a slipped slope
I could hide the chopper in the trench coat
Tunechi go berserk in this bitch
Spellin' stressed backwards, dessert when my shit
I'm reversing this shit
My double R & R, I park on the curb in this bitch
The money, I'm submerged in this shit
So frankly, I'm stalking Ben Franklin

Then, then without wings, I truly die

If you trace it back to the beginnin'
I never sold a single piece of music before Mitch Bade
This laid, the foundation for me to get paid
This day, you can still hear that gangster on a sick page
Now I'm flyin' high but dyin's, my
Fans that were buyin' I
They're cryin', ""Why
Does he have to get bigger and flow with artists from mainstream?""
Good music reaches all and he's creating a strange scene

How, far up can I go
Before you say you love me?
You love me not?
You love me?
You love me not?
I'm flying but I'm dying faster
Hoping you won't go away

How the hell are you sayin' that all the records I'm playin'
Since 2010 are not obeyin' the Strange Law
Remain raw, give your happy and pain all
Spit with a flame jaw with the teeth of a chainsaw
This what I do when I'm flyin' right off the shelf
And when something musical helps
You can't keep it all to yourself
It grows and grows, always hard never tryin' soft
So how in the world you fix your face to say that you dyin' off

How, far up can I go
Before you say you love me?
You love me not?
You love me?
You love me not?
I'm flying but I'm dying faster
Hoping you won't go away

Ah
Frustrated, cause I'm thinkin' that if enough hate it
It'll make remaining fans start feelin' their trust faded

I don't wanna die (I don't wanna die)
I just wanna keep my lifeline
And that's the family who recite N9ne's passages
And back it just cause ain't no other like mine (tight rhymes)
And even the people applaud
They still wanna bury hard, cause they don't wanna be a god
I'm higher than the stars now
The bottom is too far down
Whoever throws sand at the Nina
Yeah it kinda cuts but it ain't enough to take me down
I've been so true, so things I do will go my way
With the power of the pen, the paper, the people do as I say

How, far up can I go
Before you say you love me?
You love me not?

My fans are my lifeline, so it kills me to think how they can just cut off

There can only be one

Thou shall only be me
When the whole world's changing
All shall remain

I'm flying higher more and more everyday
But lately, I've been feelin' like I should just fly away",Dyin' Flyin'

Reppin rojo on Jimmy Kimmel had some disturbed
But niggas know that we ruff and rugged so mums the word
Tech N9na face painted look like he come ta purge!
Real scorpio, shoot this thing like a Torpedo
Rock the rip, no remorse we go
Dummy like Mork from Ork, we know
And I say that with the utmost respect
I bust low to death, I must bode the check
It's never enough, no for Tech
So I get sick with it, I make a bitch dig it
Even when I wanna speed it up and I quick-spit it
I get a bit wicked up in a battle
Tryin to bite a buck, I blabber in his fitted
Killin' music get me spiff sitted, I can't piss when it become hard
So I need a chick to hit it when I kick a lyric
And I'mma murder 'til I'm on the yard (Murder)
My verbs are like birds that jerk up and merk the weak twerps
You can't hurt the durka
First to, insert the work inside of the earth
I disperse the curse to reverse ya to the worst of ya venomous
Squirt ya mercer (Ugh)
Trip not, you see I got the advantage in hip hop
Cause rappers sound identical so when N9na's shit drop
I do numbers, I'm the pinnacle so never will it stop
Y'all can't beat me doin' nothing, except for
Stalkin' these thoughts I spew and suckin'
We run this independent game, it ain't no screwin' us
When we runnin' everything except our mouth while they blue and sufferin'
This on the Bible, I kill any life with a script from this rhyme
Music's done divine, this is my rifle
There aren't any like it cause this one is N9ne, is a gift from his mind

I wanna give, give it all
I said, I said, I said, I said
I wanna try to kill everything in my way
Everybody say, hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!

Yo, I Got the call from Tech N9ne
He needed assistance from the group with the best rhymes
That spit the heat up off of yo ass and grind
Fuck all of them flex rhymes
I get love in every city I sack in cause I rep mine
Around the world, the girls give me head on tour cause I headline
I gotta get fed, I'm fed up, my homies is doin' fair time
I look at that clock and all I see is ""Go get that bread"" time
Lost too many soldiers so tears, I gotta shed mine
Turn on the radio, hear yo shit, and oh, it's bedtime
I fall asleep, it all is weak, most y'all shouldn't be called MCs
Bro, ya discography, you ain't sale cause all of ya talk is cheap
Smoke up all the tree, my whip look like it got a fog machine
My crib look like a pharmacy, that's prolly why you wanna haul my team

Livin' facetious, what the hell, why the weed lit
I make change where I see fit
I don't play like I don't see shit
Yeah, one hunnit, one hunnit, keep it that way and it's a poem
And stay away from the hate and keep all yo plays right in motion
Bust it, I'm down after the sun and up before it, better know it
MVP, most valuable poet, been the coldest, kept it focused
Cause you miss every goal that you don't shoot for
And every time you cut a corner, you make two more
The rich is in my life, so I don't have to have the things
And listen for the whispers so I don't have to hear the screams
And I go hard for what I want, so it's just colors when I dream
And then you realize, it's not as scary as it seems
Molly's for pussies

I wanna give, give it all
I said, I said, I said, I said
I wanna try to kill everything in my way
Everybody say, hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!

Ain't nobody handle me, heated like a candle be
Kissin' dirt, ya man'll be for tryin' to dismantle me
Music is my weapon, true, loud enough to deafen you
Never trip with Tech and crew, be careful who you steppin' to

Ride on my bus? No K, you can't

I was raised a cool brother but these motherfuckers went and summoned a nigga!
I swore to never let a man's hands take me to my grave nigga
With my fortune, I'mma get to torchin', like Orkin I spray nigga
I know they dyin' to get it with the N9ne
That's fine, they wanna make a nigga do the woop
So I'mma take the carbine and put it to ya mind
It's goin' through you, not around ya like a hula hoop
Put that on the bible, if ya fuckin' with Tech, get the rifle
Totally trippin', tryna take my title, lift you right up in the sky with the Eiffel

Got a problem, what he really wanna do?
If you know like I know, then you know, true
And niggas make songs but they really don't do
What they say, got guns but they really won't shoot
He afraid, I'll lay a nigga down right now
Face to the concrete, nose to the ground
Do him in the streets 'fore his prayers hit the cloud
And the flash and a bang, it is rarely allowed
But a whole body down and a hole in the ground
Dig one for the niggas who be holdin' ya down
Better know I got rounds and they will go around, it's enough
Eat a bullet from the four-pound if ya tough
And then let the choppa spray ya down and get up
Ya pull that off, I'll believe you ain't soft
Otherwise, nigga you just soft as all them other guys
I'll kill ya dead and I put that on my mother eyes
Don't listen to these niggas, they just kick a bunch of lies
How they got a bunch of guns? Shot 'em all a bunch of times
I really do believe Tech got a bunch of nines
Before they gave my nigga Meech a bunch of time
I really know my nigga Young had a bunch of pies
For the low, all my niggas had it for the high
So you believe them niggas out there talking bout they BMF?
They should be them niggas, none of mine
I know Young got it bout what he rap bout
I really pulled Meek Millz out the trap house
Just like I seen Doe B with a OZ
Turn around, two weeks, had a whole ki
Just cause I said as a joke that the dope game dead

I don't wanna be part of this
But I let it take me
So I let it take me
Now it's dripping all over me

We on this Earth as we hell raisers
We crave good life but born into this dead-zone
I've searched for answers from my female maker
In the cemetery but they never produced her headstone

Black as ever like shabba
Thick and oozing like lava
See this room with my Prada, dadda
Must've came from my father
‘Cause my momma, was an angel
But this thang grow, insane bro

When I got at the top and they made him pretty hot
'Cause he knowin that Tecca Ninna's a dirty chopper
He's handle, holmes, here's a handful
How in the hell he hovering having hella go H.A.M. Though?
I said to Seven, ""Richard Havens'll be the man""
So we put it together thinking Eminem was a gamble
Guess not, cause he be the guest spot
Kaliko said, ""what we doin'?,"" I said to I'm, let's chop
So now the people finally get three of the best locked
Never be another choppers comin' so let's rock, nigga

Yes, I got another killer making a tour strong
If you thinking of battling, you're gone!

Nobody can catch up, meet the Speedy Gonzalez
The beat is the problem
And if ya got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em and I mean a lot of 'em
And me and Nina used to follow them
I've got to audibly body them
And this is it man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And the fans will lift hands, we'll be dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain't ever been a gift for me to heat 'em, I beat 'em, I burn 'em
Then I let 'em melt
They never heard of us, but look at me, I'm turning up
I slap the shirt off a stupid simpleton makin ‘em be impotent
If and when I be flipping niggas be feminine
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I'm living in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast so I smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure
(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half ass delivering I'mma eat your dinner
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys
I jump around so do that mean that I'm rubberized?

If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills of ecstasy pills next to me
In the seats spilled or she eat ‘em all with a breakfast drink
(You inspect the sink?)
In the habit of grabbing a mic and babbling, I dabble in the Vic's
But I might just swallow my fucking Ritalin tablet after the night
I'm grabbing it right from the medicine cabinet
'Cause that's what it's like and attack it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in my backpack when I write
All this anger pent up inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I'd try to set a big enough fire
That'll trigger the sprinkler system
And I'd escape, but the getaway driver screwed up my limo
Collided with the center divider
I went through the window and ended up being
Pinned to the side of a semi
Offended beside a friend of the guy's wife
Friend of the flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
‘Cause when I pick up a pen I'm venomous
And I'm as thick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist sinister
You've been yelling dementedness
I invented this, I'm the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate
I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy
Envious of female independence
Hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this

That I'm thinkin' about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way for ‘em to picket it
I pick a day to be picked and I'm picking the wickedest shit to say
Spin it back on a level, incredible, head of a rebel, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away, uh-uh not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake
Eatin' lobster, steak and coffee cake
At a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take like Kanye
Walking up on the stage for Beyonce
Like it's my job to say
That you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition, replenish the Punisher
With his gun at your hundred words
And a clip on that which motherfuckers better run
If you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don't wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the.

So I'm withering away and I'ma trigger when I spray
And I'm attacking everybody till the feeling's gone!

All my life I loved with people, so passive back then
I thought I'd be above this evil, my tolerance level
Then was up with doves and eagles
Currently I've hit ground zero under bugs and beetles
I'm tilted, inside my head's a lettuce but wilted
Serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine I spilt it
Could it be how many times I've been ran over and jilted?
That makes me wanna totally detach from light and just kill shit

I'll know when the pain is gone
It's just a matter of time before my bosses win
And I can feel the wrong
Coming up through the cracks of my heart again
I'm holding on, I'm going
Straight into the mouths of makers
Everything that keeps me calm was taken
I'm letting go, I'm burning through, reserves are low
Just pushing on these old restraints
My time is up cause it's too late

I'm about to blow up on anyone in my way
My anger's set to show up, at any time today
I'm about to blow up on anyone in my way
My anger's set to show up, at any time today

I am lookin' for some fire, yeah, putting on my gang attire

Look at me wither to waste, so get the fuck outta my face

I gotta say, when my mother died, I really did inside
And that's the other thing that did it
Turning my crazy on a hundred babies gonna plummet
Maybe I should be committed

What am I supposed to do?
Do I just keep faking? Fucking forsaking everything I am?

Oh but you're making me do this
I can scream while you stand there clueless
If you're listening I've made up my mind
Take another step and I'll snap this time!

Something please save me, I'm losing myself

I don't think I wanna stop it, but the feeling inside is nauseous
I get really exhausted off it, gotta find a way to wash it lock it
Profit nada so I got to drop it, ain't nobody in the cockpit
Toss this lostness, people from the office boxes
If you cross this boss live cautious
Don't make me, don't make me repeat myself
For your safety, because a pilly is beneath my belt
But I don't wanna do anything bad to anybody
But I'll never be perfect

comin' at you from me I think they deserve it

Chemically imbalanced, completely disposable
So butter my knuckles and taste it
Another sick delinquent is wasted
I don't forgive, I don't forget
I haven't got time to regret
Everybody else in the world can hate me
Nobody but me can save me!

Angels chose to toss woes when the night air's cold

To the heavens you can hand me
'Cause my guy will never just land me
Down deep with Satan, that is not my home in hell
But where I'm living now, people are living foul
They keep they heaters on the key to stone
I'm mentally stiffened, wow
A lot of love is missing now, so (I'll soon be gone)
'Cause they don't wanna listen to what I'm giving thou
Love, but who gets it usually disperse
B-b-but wait, it gets worse, I found out it never helped it hurts
I thought my job was to give it all the works
To many it's worldly, when you can't control your thirst
So if I can't bring happy, I'll go
Flings that this queen catch me really seems tacky, ya know?

(I know)
Ya know?
(I know)
Ya know?
(I know)
Man

This world is not my home
This life will soon be gone
And one day, I'll spread my wings
Gonna fly away, I'm gonna fly away

Fear not, cause this ain't the point when you hear shots
Me, and my peers got, by God's will dropped in the weird pot
I wanna ascend cause I'm feelin' like I'm near shock
Mama gone I'm feelin' like I want the rest of my years blocked
You got your ears locked?
I wanna fly away cause inside I have eternal tear drops

This world is not my home
This life will soon be gone
And one day, I'll spread my wings
Gonna fly away, I'm gonna fly away

Strange Music",Worldly Angel
Tech N9ne,"Ever since my cradle date, or my prenatal state
I was blessed with the gift to disable hate
With fatal takes on the mic is makin' my halo break
And smash every lady workin' at Strange, call them my label-mates
I throw the squad up, them I'ma pour ya broad up
Genital, so plentiful, ya chemical's low but shot up
Wishin' they'd slow the god up
But I ain't trippin' when I rip I'm twitchin'
They think that I be sniffing on Snow Tha Product
Bitch I might be, this a nice key, to get ya hyphy
Dick ya wifey, this for Ike
Slice of sin or source if ya see somethin' slither slightly
Step inside the surface of Strange, sir, simply sight-see
Spit the flow, get the dough, then I hit the ho
Mister irresistible twisted is this kiss the toes
I'ma kick ya nose if one of ya pricks oppose
I'm all he hates, cause I became a landmark like Ollie Gates
Maudie's great, tall estate, y'all debate, nigga, call me Yates

It's no challenge, It's no challenge at all
When you up the ball against the low average
The low average, killin' 'em, toetag 'em
I'ma let you be great though
But it ain't no stoppin' a Yates

Lately I've been like fuck rap
What? Did he say ""fuck rap""?
Oh no no, I'mma write in bold and plus caps
FUCK RAP
Cuz all these tough cats really don't have no nut sack
Trust that 'nuff scratch does back much wackness
Flush that shit
Down with the gowns with the sounds for the clowns
And not in a good way
You can drown underground with the pounds
When they gust that shit
Oh so, low we stojo, hoes and dough negro we flow though
Let the soul glow, mojo, nigga
Pillowcase, over the head of the industry
Illustrate, with my mouth and murders my ministry
Seal the fate of my enemy, feel the weight of my energy
I heal the hate. Facilitate. Disc jockey's will scrilla make
Then play your records until you break radio
Ain't nothing but real estate
It's still a fake deal of mates who ain't real awake
But the mill is great, ain't no iller ape that can kill a Yates

It's no challenge, It's no challenge at all
When you up the ball against the low average
The low average, killin' 'em, toetag 'em
I'ma let you be great though
But it ain't no stoppin' a Yates

I can keep my head, while everybody losin' theirs
No Marcus, I told you, don't start this debate
I'm all arsenal friend, we the median like, you feedin' me in
Tired of bein' with the intermediate
Faded on bullshit, control the whole medium
I done ran inside my meniscus
I done out-rapped everybody Christmas
So why in the hell would I fail?
If I do, I'm just being Ezale
Front line level, untamed, unchained
After all this shit, I remain on lane, loser
And that's what yo ass get for hittin' that snoozer
My brain is worth the future, and yes, I don't get worked
So my verses hurts when they send me to kill 'em
I'm like Biblin' niggas, keepin' it blacker than Power Rangers
But why the name Zachary? No leashes, I'm free sucker
No reachin' no knee deep into mine
Like a comprehension of lines
Revisit them when you wanna hear that real wizard (?)
Young and timeless, elite science, prominent and flyin'
And beat them beats to meet and greet but I conscience",Yates

Tech N9ne,"For what I wanted to do was take some of my classic beats
And send 'em to my artists to see what they would come
Up with on these beats that I love so much
So I wanna call stevie stone and ces cru to murder, let's go

Feel the hate when they come around
To the bull that set a doubt
Feel the love, I'm the great and or the true
See the fakes and the snakes, I'm always outta bounds
See I been dealt a hand, my nigga, I can peep
Peeping the shifty fans, my nigga
They gon' (see) see me going h.a.m, getting bigger, nigga
(talk that shit if you want to hack my tech n9ne plead again)
Make sure you remember me, me the odd ball liquor
When stevie get to speaking, the plot
Thickens with and these niggas is vixens
Competition, it's really contradiction (uh-huh!)
Learning from the realest slim pickings
I love it, how you doubt a nigga, hound a nigga
Panned out, all this profit sought the stone to stand stout
On rigid and rare routes, it's like procedure to hear a nigga out
Strangeulation two and it's right now
Let's take it to another level, hot metal, black kettle, bitch
High pitched, fly shit, five settle, five words like the bandit lord
I think this weed got me paranoid
Middle finger to my enemies, I say all you niggas is bitches
Jurisdiction have so many restrictions
All you niggas is fiction, no conviction
Niggas get to dissin', I'll have you outta commission
Bodies missing, call my brother to lynch 'em
All you niggas is gimmicks, frail body and soul
All you niggas pretending, thought that we so-called family
All you niggas can get it, turning my volume up
Had us upon that midget
Let me hear you say names, let me hear you holler strange
I'm contained with flame, will leave your bodies decaying
Niggas be playing games, my niggas take your name
Have you in a debacle, better stay in your lane
Guess time'll tell (guess time'll tell, guess time'll tell)

Right hand over my heart of hearts I'm pledging allegiance
To ces, for whatever the reasons I have withered the seasons
They're dead in the breeze, I'm ready to feed 'em
I never believed 'em, you son of a bitch, son of a preacher, word of
Heaven and jesus, two seven and greaser, separation is still
And spreading diseases, my recommendation is cheddar your cheeses
Maybe you better get business, like I didn't know that I carried the load
I know your boy is heavy and heaving
That's word to strange and tech the n9ne, I mean, who better to lead us
Since I been with that team I been spinning them g's
Bitch, yeah, you better believe it, cash come in a bulk amount now
I'm staying ahead of my dreams so the fuck could I sulk about
For real, I'll never be satisfied still, I don't be vocal out loud
Respect is due, I show it, don't blow it, my records are outbound
Chill, I'm choosing my weapons wisely, we never will lose direction
Guide 'em through the recession proof, should include a confession, truth
Started from the bikini bottom, we're here but it's something fishy
Twenty sixteen, strange music, making some fucking history

I know they want me to put up the pen
And just quit with the rapping, it won't never happen, no
For the minutes that I been in it
I'm a killer still in the back but I'm clapping though
In a matter of fact I been acting, so
Out of wack and my brain is on overload
I don't call anybody, ain't nobody calling me
Maybe I don't need a phone no mo'
Guess I won’t pay the bill and the villain is
spillin' venom in him till i’m a goner
And haters are catering to me with
Wishes that I wouldn't win any longer
Idiot, you're just making me stronger
Wanna kill me, then pay me no mind
Get a record to spot a bit longer
If you don't feel me then get on your grind
I don't mean to be mean but the measure
Is simple when you try to weather the outcome
Now I don't need a reason, killing any season
In fact I am better without one
You don't know anything about heat or the
Temp of the weather that I'm coming out from
And I wouldn't consider you equal like other people
Where the fuck is your album?
Shit to you is a hobby and obviously y'all
Ain't knowing to measure at all
Murdering it for pleasure, ain't fucking with godi
I'm sick with a medicine ball
Couldn't give 'em a shit, not even a little bit cause they haters, we know it
We all know the location, come get your face winched
