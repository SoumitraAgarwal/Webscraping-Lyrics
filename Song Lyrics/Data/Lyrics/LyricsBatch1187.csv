Steve Tyrell,"Rain drops keep fallin' on my head
And just like the guys whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothing seems to fit, those rain drops are fallin' on my head
They keep fallin

So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleeping on the job
Those rain drops are fallin' on my head
They keep fallin'

But there is one thing I know
The blues they sent to meet me, want to feed me
It wont be long till the happiness steps up to greet me

Rain drops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't my eyes will soon be turning red
Cryings not for me
Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Cause I'm free, nothings worrying in me

It wont be long till the happiness steps up to greet me
Rain drops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't my eyes will soon be turning red
Cryings not for me
Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Cause I'm free, nothings worrying in me",Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head
Steve Tyrell,"When you go through a day
And the things that people say
They make you feel so small

They make you feel that your heart will just never stop aching
And when you just cant accept the abuse you are taking

[Chorus]
Darling, reach out for me
Don't you worry ill see you through
You just have to reach out for me
I'll be there to, I'll comfort you

When good friends prove untrue
And the things they do to you
They make you feel so bad

They make you feel that
You haven't a reason for living
So when you feel you
Could throw in the towel and just give in

[Chorus]

Comfort you and love you
How I'm gonna love you baby

When you feel that your heart 
Will just never stop aching
And when you just cant 
Accept the abuse you been taking

[Chorus: x2]",Reach Out for Me
Steve Tyrell,"If you see me walkin' down the street and I start to cry
Each time we meet, walk on by
Walk on by, make believe that you don't see the tears
Just let me breathe in private
Cause each time I see you ill break down and cry

Oh walk on by, oh walk on by

I just cant get over losing you
So if I sing broken and blue
Walk on by, walk on by

Foolish pride is all that I have left
So let me hide the tears and the sadness you gave me when 
You said goodbye
Walk on by, oh walk on by
Walk on by, oh walk on by

Walk on, 

Walk on by, walk on by

Foolish pride thats all that I have so let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me when you said goodbye
Oh walk on by, walk on by
Walk on by babe, now you really gotta go and walk on by
Make me believe you never saw the tears I cried
Walk on by
Walk on by sweet love and don't stop",Walk on By
Steve Tyrell,"[Chorus]
What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 
It's the only thing that there's just too little of 
What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 
No, not just for some, but for everyone 

Look, we don't need another mountain 
There are oceans and rivers 
Enough to cross, enough to last 
Until the end of time 

[Chorus]

Lord we dont need another meadow
There are corn fields and wheat fields enough to grow
There are sun beams and moon beams enough to shine
This I know, if you want to know

[Chorus]

What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 
What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 
What the world needs right about now 
What the world needs now

What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love

Is love, sweet love 
It's the only thing that there's just too little of 
What the world needs now 
Is love, sweet love 
No, not just for some, just for everyone

No, not just for some, but for everyone",What the World Needs Now
Steve Tyrell,"You smile, the song begins you speak and 
Hear violins it's magic 
The stars deserve the sky and in 
Your eyes it's magic 
With out a golden one, a mystic chance 
Fantastic things begin 
When I am in your arms 
When we walk hand in hand the world 

Becomes a wander land 
How we can explain those rainbows 
When that it's no rain, it's magic 
What do I tell my self, this things 
That happened are already truth 
When in my heart I know the magic 
It's my love for you",It's Magic
Steve Tyrell,"Strolling along country roads with my baby. 
It starts to rain, it begins to pour. 
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin. 
I feel a shiver run up my spine.
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.

Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside. 

After a while we run under a tree. 
I turn to her and she kisses me. 
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves 
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes.
Sharing our love under stormy skies.

Oo, I hear laughter in the rain, 
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.

Oo, I hear laughter in the rain, 
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside. 
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain, 
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside.
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feelinside",Laughter in the Rain
Steve Tyrell,"They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway 
They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't have enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you fine
On Broadway 
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues 
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
 
They say that I won't last too long 
On Broadway 
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say 
But they get wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar

I won't quit till I'm a star
On Broadway 
On Broadway

Steve Vai,"I need some junk
To shoot in my vein
Would you give me some
To relieve the pain?

These city streets
Are drivin' me insane
I tried laundry detergent
But it's not the same

I need some food
To stuff in my face
But the garbage man
He took the trash away

These city streets
Are makin' me crazy
I tried to eat rocks
But they have no taste

My face is a wreck
My brain's decayed
I need a fix ‘n I'll be OK
These city streets
Are makin' me crazy
I'm chewing on glass but I
Don't even bleed
I don't even bleed
I don't even bleed
I don't even bleed

I'll pray tonight
To the king of kings
Won't you pull me out
I'd rehabilitate those city streets
You know I can't keep straight
Will I murder somebody?
Well ya can't fool fate
Ya can't fool fate
Ya can't fool fate
No, you can't fool fate

I need some help, I need some help,
I'm falling apart
Will I die in my sleep
Or will I live in the streets
In agony?",Junkie
Steve Vai,"Here we stand
As time keeps turning
Near and far
The fires are burning

Victory
The endless passion
For a cause
We will take an action

I'm not a savior
I'm not a king
There's only one voice in your head
But I feel your anger
I speak your peace
Freedom time is here
So are you ready for the
Here & Now

Sacrifice
The soul needs baring
Bring new life
To a world worth sparing

I'm not a prophet
I'm not a prince

Harvest time is here
But tell me are you ready for the
Here & Now

Courage

Freedom

One for all

So you be the fire

Precious time is here
So tell me are you ready for the

Steve Vai,"I'm watchin' you, I'm wantin' you, but you turn away
I'd crawl through broken glass to you, but it wouldn't pay
You take me for a fool, but if you only knew
What I do in my dreams with you

You're so cold and critical, and baby that's too bad
So my reality will have to come to me in my dreams

I know that you belong to me every night, you suddenly appear in my eyes
It happens when I sleep, it isn't right, what I do in my dreams with you
It isn't right what I do in my dreams with you

I love the way you come to me every night
My fantasies are real, and they never lie
If you only knew, what I do in my dreams with you, yeah
It isn't right, Lord knows that it isn't right

The world can make you cynical, with all its love and pain
But I don't have to carry the weight of the world

I know that you belong to me every night, you suddenly appear in my eyes
It happens when I sleep, it isn't right, what I do in my dreams with you
It isn't right what I do in my dreams with you

Baby don't wake me, let me take you on an endless journey
We touch, and the softest kiss explodes with lust, yeah
It's real, you can't deny the heat you feel
And if I die before I wake, baby, that's all right

I know that you belong to me every night, you suddenly appear in my eyes
It happens when I sleep, it isn't right, what I do in my dreams with you
It isn't right what I do in my dreams with you

I know that you belong to me every night, you suddenly appear in my eyes
",In My Dreams With You
Steve Vai,"And though the sun goes down
The fever you adore is burning in your breast
Helpless in the fall from paradise into your bed
For here it is sown, in time we forget what is man

Don't let your body cry
This game of love is war
And I'm already dead

You say- Hold me down and wash away
This hunger from my flesh
And make me reborn in sweet innocence
Come on and make me live

It's voodoo that you possess
(Your heaven is danger)
Deny your dark side, I know
All about your secret life 
Oh Eve

And so the moon is high 
I see that love is blind
To the fire in your eyes

As our garden fiercely burns
We have no place to hide
Naked and cold running from the wind
Now wrapped in skin

It's voodoo that you possess
(Your heaven is danger)
Deny your dark side, I know
All about your secret life

It's voodoo that you possess
(Your heaven is danger)
Behind those lucid eyes
The shadow of the serpent lies
Oh Eve 
All about Eve

And though the sun goes down 
The mortals never know",All About Eve
Steve Vai,"[ANATOLY]
No man, no madness
Though their sad power may prevail
Can possess, conquer, my country's heart
They rise to fail
She is eternal
Long before nations' lines were drawn
When no flags flew, when no armies stood
My land was born.

And you ask me why I love her
Through wars, death and despair.
She is the constant, we who don't care
And you wonder will I leave her -- but how?
I cross over borders but I'm still there now.

How can I leave her?
Where would I start?
Let man's petty nations tear themselves apart
My land's only borders lie around my heart.",Bangkok

Steve Vai,"Words fall silent when no one will hear
Emotions are deadly when there's too much to fear
Touch a feeling and we feel again
To know the pleasure, we must know the pain

I'm going down for the last time
Open your eyes

Who's gonna hear you when you're callin'
And who's gonna catch you when you're fallin'
Who's gonna trust you
Well I'll be around for a while

And who's gonna heal you when you're bleeding
And who's gonna give to you when you're needing
And who's gonna love you
Well I'll be around for a while

When love lies bleeding only fools are bold
They search for pennies in a pot of gold
Faith is dying when no one's to trust
But your soul is crying
And it's glorious

It's coming down to the last time
Open your heart

Who's gonna hear you when you're callin'
And who's gonna catch you when you're fallin'
And who's gonna laugh with you
Well I'll be around for a while

And who's gonna warm you when you're freezing
And who's gonna hold you when you're screaming
And who's gonna promise you
To be around for a while

There you stand, drowning in the rain
Kidding yourself the wind don't sting
And all this time the thing you want is calling to you

I dig the way you take that storm
While spitting in the face of right and wrong
Well you could let down your defenses
When you're in my arms

You could my face
In my arms
You could dream on and on
In my arms
You would never be alone
In my arms
You could cry like a child
In my arms

Who's gonna hear you when you're callin'
And who's gonna catch you when you're fallin'
And who's gonna trust you
Well I'll be around for a while

And who's gonna mend you when you're broken
And who's gonna find you when you're stolen
And who will always love you
I'll be around for a while

And who's gonna shield you when it's rainin'
And who's gonna kneel with you when you're prayin'
Who's gonna feel for you
Well I will, I'll be around for a while

Who's gonna help you when you're tryin'
And who's gonna hold you when you're dyin'
Who's gonna beg you

Steve Vai,"Everybody's a dreamer
And everybody's a star
And everybody's in movies
It doesn't matter who you are

There are stars in every city
In every house and on every street
And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Their names are written in concrete

Don't step on Greta Garbo
As you walk down the Boulevard
She looks so weak and fragile
That's why she tried to be so hard

But they turned her into a princess
And they sat her on a throne
But she turned her back on stardom
Because she wanted to be alone

You can see all the stars as you
Walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognize
Some that you hardly even heard of

People who worked and suffered
And struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some
Who suffered in vain

Rudolph Valentino looks
Very much alive
And he's lookin' up ladies' dresses
As they sadly pass him by

Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi
'Cause he's liable to turn and bite
But stand close by Bette Davis
Because hers was such a lonely life

And if you covered him with garbage
George Ganders would still have style
And if you stamped on Micky Roonie
He would still turn around and smile

But please don't tread on our dearest Marilyn
'Cause she's not very tough
She should have been made of finer steel
But she was only made of flesh and blood

And you can see all the stars
As you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognize
Some that you hardly ever heard of

People who worked and suffered
And struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some
Who suffered in vain

Everybody's a dreamer
And everybody's a star
And everybody's in movies
It doesn't matter who you are

And those who are successful
Be always on your guard
Success walks hand in hand
With failure along Hollywood Boulevard

I wish my life was a non-stop Hollywood movie show
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain
And celluloid heroes never really die

And you can see all the stars
As you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognize
Some that you hardly ever heard of

People who worked and suffered
And struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some
Who suffered in vain

La la la la [unverified]
Celluloid heroes never feel any pain
And celluloid heroes never really die

I wish my life was a non-stop Hollywood movie show

And celluloid heroes never really die

Je sais je n’ai pas appelé assez souvent
Ni avant de débarquer un soir de semaine, ridé
J’avais seulement envie de t’entendre me raconter
Que dans ton temps le ciel était plus bleu qu’aujourd’hui
Que le bonhomme 7 heures faisait sa ronde à minuit
Que tout le monde se tenait pour le meilleur, pour le pire

Steve W. Mauldin,"Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone.
Let's pretend that we're together, all alone.
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low,
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go.

Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true,
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man,
If you want me, answer ""yes"" or ""no,""

Steve W. Mauldin,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.
 
Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a guy with a drink in his hand. 
He had bay blue eyes, coal black hair 
And a smile that a girl understands. 
Then he came and sat down at my table,
And as he placed his hands over mine,
I found my self wanting to kiss him 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and he whispered, ""I need you!""
""Let me take you away and be your man.""
Then I looked into his eyes and I saw it:

Steve Walsh,"Well they called the flat plains Kansas a long, long time ago
When they'd seen the gates of glory and the fire down below
The many great decisions of the people in this place 
You could tell the strength within them, you could see it their face

Well it's been 9 or 10 years since I started my ramblin' round
And from hand to mouth I was livin' playing every bar in town
Though a dollar a day didn't go too far I could never deny my pride
I couldn't lay back and be taken care of while the world went by outside 

So I went to school to learn but I didn't like what they'd teach
And I went to church to pray but I didn't like what they'd preach 
I was hard-headed, young and angry, and I felt I could take the heat 
And I had to find out my own way how to live out on the street 

So I packed my bags and I left here to peruse the streets alone 
And I saw that side of midnight where the beggars howl and groan 
Places filled with desperation where the future ain't so bright 
But I remember back in Kansas when we sang a song at night 

We sang every step of the way 
Though your dreams can be real don't let them slip slide away 
Doesn't matter at all, let them do as they will 
Someday you'll hear them call for you

Goin'  around and round from town to town I tried to make my way 
I believed that all my searching and struggling would payoff bug some day 
As a teenager I was rowdy and I played for good and bad
Though I knew my songs had meaning at times it made me mad

And I'd fight the wars of nations if it brought somebody peace
Yes I'd fight the wars of madmen if I knew the fight would cease
But this ol' world never stopped turning when my mind was full of doubt
So I went on and played for a dollar a day and I sang  this song straight out 

Hey hey, every step of the way 
Though your dreams can be real, don't let them slip slide away 
Doesn't matter at all, let them do as they will 
Someday you'll hear them call for you
Oh yeah , for you
When they call out your name say it loud and clear 
Come on, come on 

You must have seen me traveling' around you must have seen me there
Tryin' to find out where I was heading you could have tossed to care 
Well, I had all the questions, I wanted the answers 
I knew in my heart it was all part of the game 
But every step was so much harder,  every step of the way 
I knew that time would beat me someday 

Hey hey, every step of the way 
Though your dreams can be real, don't let them slip slide away 
Doesn't matter at all, let them do as they will 
Someday you'll hear them call for you
Oh yeah, for you",Every Step of the Way

It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue.

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

I am so awfully misunderstood

It's ten stories to my desk in the smoggy sky
But after five, I'm headed home to heaven
To an easy world
There ain't nothin' like the love of a small town girl
Hot coffee and the sound of her sweet voice callin
Country station on the kitchen radio
That's how I know
There's still a little magic
In this crazy world...
There ain't nothin' like the love of a small town girl
She makes love to me in real close two part harmony
She makes the city feel like walks in the cool country rain
No traffic and the sound of the street is quiet
Fifth avenue is dressed in a foot of snow
No where to go but underneath the covers
Lovers while the snowflakes swirl

Yes, I knew all along, But that's not enough

There was somebody's car parked outside.
Damn my eyes, Damn this heart of mine.

She'll be easy to see.

Steve Wariner,"For so long I was looking
For a reason to make living worthwhile
I found that reason
When I first saw you smile
There was no question you were the answer
For a partner with no dancer or no song
You set my life to music
The day you came along

And there for awhile
All of my dreams came true
There for awhile
There was nothing I couldn't do
Yes, there for awhile
The future was finally clear
'Cause there for awhile
There for awhile, you were here

I guess I never asked you
Afraid of what the answer might be
Would you love me forever
Never wanting to be free?
I had no way of knowing
Just how soon you'd be going away
Would it have made a difference
If only I'd asked you to stay

Now I don't know
What my life could hold for me
'Cause I know that I had it all
When you were holding me

Yes, there for awhile
The future was finally clear
'Cause there for awhile
There for awhile, you were here

There for awhile, you were here

L.A. looks like heaven with its ever open arms
My mama said to watch yourself like mamas always do
Daddy said those city girls will walk all over you
So I hit the pavement running down on Hollywood and Vine
I got to town by seven and I fell in love by nine
She was a California angel wearing alligator shoes
She had that something that a poor boy can't refuse

She was incredible, she was 
A crash course in the blues
Now we're screaming down the freeway 
In this fancy foreign car
Headed for another party 
Never seen so many stars
Just when I thought I'd make my move 
And ask her to be mine
She takes off with somebody else 

And kisses me goodbye
She was incredible, she was 
A crash course in the blues
Well she was way too hard to handle 
For a country boy like me

One spark from that fiddle bow could set this place on fire
It's so cool to be here
In the hottest place in town
Feels so right
It's Saturday night
And we're burnin' the roadhouse down

[Chorus]",Burnin' the Roadhouse Down
Steve Wariner,"Mississippi rain comin' down on me
Thirty more miles I'm back in Tennessee
I keep watchin' that clock but the hands don't move
The road gets longer the closer I get to you

Wind sheild wipers slappin' out the time
Radio on tryin' to ease my mind
Lonesome song tellin' me the truth
The road gets longer the closer I get to you

This ol' pickup truck ain't fast enough
I've been gone too long
I've got the pedal down to the floor
But it's my heart that's racin' on
I ain't far from heaven
But one thing that is true
The road gets longer the closer I get to you

This ol' pickup truck ain't fast enough
I've been gone too long
I've got the pedal down to the floor
But it's my heart that's racin' on
I ain't far from heaven
But one thing that is true
The road gets longer the closer I get to you",Closer I Get to You
Steve Wariner,"It's an old-fashioned feeling
In a world that's gone wild
It's a walk by the river
On a slow summer night
It's the rhythm of love
Everywhere I go
It's the sound of her voice here in my soul

[Chorus:]
Every little whisper, every little sigh
Every time I hold her I think I'm gonna die
Every time her heart beats I know that I'm alive
With ever little whisper, every little sigh

There's this thing that she does and she don't even know
I don't say a word, man I just let her go
There's a smile that she saves when she lets her hair down
Deep in the night there is only one sound",Every Little Whisper
Steve Wariner,"One day shy of eight years old,
When grandma passed away.
I was a broken hearted little boy,
Blowing out that birthday cake.
How I cried when the sky let go,
With a cold lonesome rain.
My mom smiled, said: ""Don't be sad child.
""Grandma's watching you today.""

""'cause there's holes in the floor of Heaven,
""And her tears are pouring down.
""That's how you know she's watching,
""Wishing she could be here now.
""An' sometimes if you're lonely,
""Just remember she can see.
""There's holes in the floor of Heaven
""And she's watching over you and me.""

Seasons come and seasons go,
Nothing stays the same.
I grew up, fell in love,
Met a girl who took my name.
Year by year, we made a life,
In this sleepy little town.
I thought we'd grow old together,
Lord, I sure do miss her now.

""'cause there's holes in the floor of Heaven,
""And her tears are pouring down.
""That's how you know she's watching,
""Wishing she could be here now.
""An' sometimes if you're lonely,
""Just remember she can see.
""There's holes in the floor of Heaven
""And she's watching over you and me.""

Well my little girl is 23,
I walk her down the aisle.
It's a shame her Mom can't be here now,
To see her lovely smile.
They throw the rice, I catch her eye,
As the rain starts coming down.
She takes my hand; says: ""Daddy don't be sad,
'cause I know Mama's watching now.""

""'cause there's holes in the floor of Heaven,
""And her tears are pouring down.
""That's how you know she's watching,
""Wishing she could be here now.
""An' sometimes if you're lonely,
""Just remember she can see.
""There's holes in the floor of Heaven
""And she's watching over you and me.""

Watching over you and me.

Watching over you and me.

Watching over you and me.",Holes in the Floor of Heaven
Steve Wariner,"She brought some perfume from Paris
And I bought some brand new cologne
She made a candlelight dinner and I put some soft music on
We sat by the fire waiting for desire
To lift us up and take us far away
But she started getting sleepy
I turned on the tv
One more night of love just went to waste

[Chorus:]
Well it's broke and I don't know how to fix it
There's not a day goes by that I don't miss it
Yeah, love jumped the track and we just can't get it back
I still love that woman so
But it's broke and I don't know how to fix it

She said a change of scenery
Might just be the very thing we need
I said, ""What about Las Vegas?""
She said, ""What about Miami Beach?""
We ended up in Denver
But I never did convince her
That we'd reached the perfect compromise
She said, "" I hate cold weather""
I said, ""But we're together"" 
And she said, ""Yeah that's where the problem lies""

Well love doesn't come with blue prints, instructions or plans
I wish love had a road map so I could find where I am

[Chorus]",I Don't Know How to Fix It
Steve Wariner,"Back when we let the good times roll
You held on to me heart and soul
It wasn't really very long ago
Let's go back again

Reach out and turn the TV off
Slow down and let the world get lost
Slip into something nice and soft
And lie here in my arms

[Chorus:]
Love me like you love me
Do it like you mean it one more time tonight
Hold me close and love me like you love me

Take all your dreams and shattered hopes
Every angry word we ever spoke
And trade 'em for a couple cherry cokes
Lay here for a while

There are no questions that we need to ask
Every precious kiss could be our last
There is no future and there is no past
All we've got is now

Don't you know that I'll always love you
So show me that you feel it too",Love Me Like You Love Me
Steve Wariner,"Feed the cat, grab the road map
Put the house key under the mat
Don't forget to leave the kitchen light on

Pack your bags, hit the trail
Tell the neighbors to pick up the mail
The nice couple down at the end of the street
With the pink flamingo 'neath the willow tree

[Chorus:]
Put your silver key into my cold ignition
Burn a little rubber with me
Road trippin'
Head for the nearest beach
Do a little skinny dippin'
Gonna get wild and free
Road trippin', Road trippin', Road trippin' with me

We're headin' south swerving about
Cause I'm tastin' that crawdad in my mouth
Cakey cornbread and sippin' on sweet tea

We got the fuzzy dice, the bobbin' dog
The little pine tree freshener and the radio on
It doesn't get any better than this

Steve Wariner,"This morning if someone had asked if you're gone
I would've managed a smile and said we're still hanging on
But if they pressed me I could've honestly said I don't know
Oh but that was a phone call and a six pack ago

I knew we were fading but I avoided the truth
And for my fool mistakes I had no excuse
I kept telling myself I couldn't break 'neath the load
Oh but that was a good-bye and a six pack ago

[Chorus: x2]
Yes I loved you but I lost you now it's all coming down
It's our fate and it's too late to turn things around
I was convinced I could somehow just let it go
But that was a jukebox and a six pack ago

I was convinced I could somehow just let it go
But that was a fist-full of quarters and a six pack ago",A Six Pack Ago
Steve Wariner,"Lately you say he's been callin'
Saying that he wants you back
I hope and pray you're not fallin'

It's just smoke from an old flame
And smoke disappears in the wind
It's just smoke from an old flame
He'll look in your eyes and tell you more lies
And, girl, then he'll burn you again

I love you but I'd never keep you
From leaving if you want to go
It hurts me but, girl, I'll release you
If that's what you want
But I hope you know

The lights are turned way down low

How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight

By now she thinks I really miss her
But I've hardly noticed she was gone

And any minute now that phone is gonna ring
She'll say let's work it out somehow
But time keeps dragging on, what's taking her so long?
I should've heard from her by now

By now she's slipped into her night gown
She's letting down her soft brown hair
By now she needs someone to hold her
And I know she's wishing I was there

And any minute now that phone is gonna ring

Lonely women make good lovers 
They all have mercy for good lookin' smooth talkin' men

With no thoughts of evil on her mind 
She don't try to flat that seat 
Lord knows there's something every woman needs 
Friendly smile will do it, every time

Once a woman's tasted love, she can't do without 
She'll search for something more 
When she gets cold 
And if her lips are wet with wine 
When it comes to lovin' time 
She'll trade her pride for something 
Warm to hold

Burning holes in the heart of the night
Once the flames are burning bright

And dig out those old memories that's hidden in my heart

Am I blue, my oh my
You could've said you loved me, you could have even lied

Yesterday you walked away and didn't even cry
And as I sit alone tonight and think of all we had

Steve Wariner,"Jimmy was a shadow the youngest of three boys
How he longed to feel the light
Jimmy's older brothers sure could make some noise
So he became the quiet type

But deep inside he had some powerful dreams
He'd think about them then he'd smile

And he was gone, gone to somewhere far beyond
Where he was strong, strong, shining in the sun
They say that someday the meekest heart will sing
There was Jimmy waiting in the wings

Susie was a waitress morning, noon and night
But she never did complain
Jimmy'd stop for lunch there at least a thousand times
But one Monday something changed

She leaned across him with some chocolate pie
Then he looked into her eyes

And he was gone, gone to somewhere far beyond
His heart beat strong, strong, he knew she was the one
They say that someday the meekest heart will sing
Love found Jimmy waiting in the wings

And when he held her for the very first time
He found the one thing he'd been missing all his life

And they were gone, gone, to somewhere far beyond",In a Heartbeat [#]

Before you fall
You say love's definition is not
The same for us all
Well I can understand why you're afraid
And just so we're both on the same page
Let me try and make this whole thing clear

[Chorus:]
I'm talkin' pure devotion
A won't-be-denied emotion
Deeper than the ocean
Well that's love for you
It's unexplainable uncontainable irreplaceable
Well you know that it's true
That's love for you

You'll see my interpretation of love
Is right on the mark
If you'll give me half a chance
And follow your heart
Forever's what I've got in mind
So let me say this one more time
And make it as simple as I can

[Chorus: x2]",That's Love for You
Steve Wariner,"Two teardrops were floatin' down the river
One teardrop said to the other
I'm from the soft blue eyes of a woman in love
I'm a tear of joy she couldn't carry
She was so happy she just got married
I was on her cheek when she wiped me away with her glove
I could tell from the look on her face she didn't need me
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea

The other tear said we've got a connection
I'm a tear of sorrow born of rejection
I'm from the sad brown eyes of her old flame
She told him they would be lifelong companions
Left him with questions and not any answers
I was on his cheek as he stood there calling her name
I could tell he had a lot of my friends for company
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea

Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
And someday they'll be teardrops again
Released in a moment of pleasure or a moment of pain
Then they drift on down and ride to the sea again

Last night I sat in the waiting room
The nurse walked in and gave me the news
It's a baby girl and they're both fine
An old man sittin' not 10 feet away
Just lost his wife and he said to me
You've got a brand new angel and I've lost mine
I guess the good Lord giveth and the good Lord taketh away
And we both wiped a teardrop from our face

Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
A whole new circle of life begins
Where tears are a part of the pleasure and part of the pain
'Til they drift on down and ride to the sea again

Two teardrops floatin' down the river
Two teardrops floatin' down the river",Two Teardrops
Steve Wariner,"The competition's getting tough
Good enough ain't good enough
Lately I've been workin' way too hard

Go ahead and take my hand
Forget about the rainbow's end
I'd have it all if you were in my arms

So you be my everything
And I'll be the one who loves you
I don't want you to just wear my ring
I want you to be my everything

When you wish upon a star
What you dream is what you are
You've got to find your true identity

I don't want no quick success

What I need is you right here with me

But it's hard to keep your balance when your running into walls

I am blinded by the light of your love
I don't know where I'm going or which way is up
I've never been lost and liked it so much
I am blinded by the light of your love

It's difficult to focus when it's right beneath your nose

But you'd shine again like brand new 
I've got that much faith in you

If ever the lights were to go out between us 
If ever the raindrops should start to fall 
Should the winds of distrust ever rock our foundation 
I know we could weather it all 
I might not know what to do 
But I do know we'd make it through 
I've got that much faith in you

And if you were the moon 
And one night a big black cloud 
Came and covered your face 
I'd stand in the rain 
Like a statue tall and proud 
Till the clouds blew away 
I might not know what to do 
But you'd make the rain roll on through 
I've got that much faith in you

Then rewinding the tape

In a box of paints
I've been saving my poetry about you
On a written page
Now it's time to come on outÂ¡Â­no I can't wait

[Chorus:]
It's high time you knew
Everything you mean to me
What I feel for you
Coming up from underneath soul deep
I am breaking through this shy little boy
Inside of me
It's high time you knew (you saw)
Everything you mean to me

I can see you in the morning
Gentle in my arms
Or fillin' jars with lightning bugs
Chasing shooting starsÂ¡Â­
Clinging to me like a promise
Around me like a ring
I can see it so clearly my heart soars and sings

Or make the sunshine not kiss the ground  
And I can't tell this broken heart to stop loving you

Thinkin' about my life
Train rumblin' through our town

You don't hear the whistle's sad cry 
You don't see the tears in my eyes

I wish I were a train rolling on a track
With three choices 
Stop on a dime move ahead or go back 
But I can't go back and face the pain 
So I lie here and wish I were a train 

Baby once we had it all 
This ain't nobody's fault 
Seems like everything changed

Steve Wariner,"You say you're scared what if your heart breaks 
Well that's just a chance you're gonna have to take 
Cause if you want to fly you've got to spread your wings 
Take a leap of faith and see what it brings 

[Chorus:]
It wouldn't be love 
Baby if we didn't need it so much 
Or if it were that easy to give up 
If we didn't stand to lose it all 
And if it didn't hurt so much to fall 
You know it wouldn't be love 

Love can move mountains make right what is wrong 
Nothing's as gentle yet quite so strong 
And when the road gets rocky we'll be just fine 
if we always remember and keep this in mind

Tappin on the floorboard bangin' on the wheel
Punchin' every button on the radio

Only two times she gets that rush

But by the way I'm carrying on
You'd think I was you'd think I'd lost my mind
Since you've been gone
Why can't I just walk away
You know people do things a lot harder every day
And somehow they make it look so easy

Mark McGuire does it with a baseball bat
Dale Jarret does it on the race car track
Tom Hanks sure knows how to act
And he makes it look easy
Dan Rather does it on the evening news
Ray Charles does it when he's singing the blues

I've got a secret and I want to keep it
So I try to be cool
I don't want to show want no one to know
That I'll always be your fool
I wish that I could just walk away

Michael Jordan did it and he carried the team
Spielberg does it on the movie screen
Oprah she's the TV queen
And she makes it look easy
Tiger Woods does it with a little golf ball
Seems like Elway did it every fall
The great ones do it any time they choose
So why can't I forget you
And make it look easy

Princess Di she did it with class
Leno knows the right questions to ask
Nolan Ryan did it with a pitch so fast

Steve Wariner,"I remember back when I was just a kid
A little schoolyard fight
And I'd come running home again
I'm not really sure what I wanted her to do
But my Momma's words would comfort me I knew
And she'd say

It's another turn in the road
It's another step along the way
You can count on me every minute night or day
Cause if you have someone there for you
There is nothing that you can't get through
I will help you carry your load
When you come to a turn in the road

Those high school days when I thought I was a man
Not much time for her but Mom would always understand
And when I came home broken cause I'd been given back my ring
She said a little time son it heals everything

[Chorus]

Now the tables turned and Mom is on her own
Yes it's been real tough on all of us since Daddy's gone
And when she says she can't go on missing him for one more day
I just hold her close close to me and say

Steve Wariner,"Jimmy was a shadow the youngest of three boys
How he longed to feel the light
Jimmy's older brothers sure could make some noise
So he became the quiet type
But deep inside he had some powerful dreams
He'd think about them then he'd smile

[Chorus]
And he was gone, gone, to somewhere far beyond
Where he was strong, strong, shining in the sun
They say that someday the meekest heart will sing
There was Jimmy waiting in the wings

Susie was a waitress morning noon and night
But she never did complain
Jimmy'd stopped for lunch there at least a thousand times
But one Monday something changed
She leaned across him with some chocolate pie
Then he looked into her eyes

[Chorus]

And he was gone, gone, to somewhere far beyond
His heart beat strong strong he knew she was the one
They say that someday the meekest heart will sing
Love found Jimmy waiting in the wings

And when he held her for the very first time
He found the one thing he'd been missing all his life

And they were gone, gone, to somewhere far beyond

And when she smiled how his heart did sing

Steve Wariner,"Daddy always said he'd come back when the first snow came
Bringing treats like Santa Claus on Christmas day
Momma always said son don't you get your hopes too high
Daddy he's a dreamer reaching for the sky
Still I waited by the window at Christmas time
And I sat on the front steps as Easter rolled by
Then we moved to Arizona 'round the 4th of July
But Daddy never came I waited just the same

[Chorus:]
And they say it never snows in Arizona
But I never stopped believing that it would
And before I'd go to sleep at night I'd look up at the desert sky
Close my eyes the same ole prayer again
I'd wake up and see the snowfall on the sand

Part of growing up for me was learning way too soon
The difference between fantasy and cold hard truth
Momma liked to say accept those things you cannot change
She was scared I 'd be like Dad and dream my life away
But in a corner of my mind I kept a place for him
Cause a promise lasts forever when you're just a kid
Yea he told me in a season he'd be back again
But Daddy never came I waited just the same

[Chorus]

Last night my Father's sister called me on the phone
Said today your father passed away I thought that you should know
You were the one that he thought of as he left this world behind
He said tell my boy I'm goning to find a way to
Come and say goodbye

And they say it never snows in Arizona
But I'm looking out my window and it is
And I swear I can't believe my eyes to see the desert painted white

As I see the snowfall on the sand",Snowfall on the Sand

Wrapped up so the world won't find us
Alone and far away

But it can also be a dark and lonely time
And if you don't spend it with those you truly love
Well it can feel just like any other day
So this is a prayer for the lonely
Especially those children all around the world
Whose hearts have been torn apart this year

[Chorus:]
So pardon my tears things are different this year
There's a cry I can't ignore
I've thrown out my list and instead of a wish
I'm praying this Christmas prayer
That wherever you are may the bright morning star
Lead you to someone who cares

Well, Jimmy Stewart's on my screen again
Man I miss those simple black and white days
Then someone hits the remote and I see the sad dark eyes
Of a young girl on the other side of the world
And I think about the things she's had to see
Things my children can't even imagine

So whoever you are know that God's shining star
Always leads you to someone who cares",This Christmas Prayer

Steve White,"Took a walk down paramount
(I've seen better days)
Left behind a friend of mine
(I've seen better days)
Passed by a statue of saint Augustine in prayer
Said for one, the only one
I turned my back at her

The elevator rose to the eleventh floor
(I've seen better days)
Her trench coat hangs inside her door
(I've seen better days)
A leaky window welcomed rain and left me standing here
A black-haired girl who taught me truth
I turned my back on her

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days

Made love in the toronto rain
(i've seen better days)
From hamilton i look the train
(I've seen better days)
What you regret, you softly said are things you never do
I regret i didn't turn
And run back home to you

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days, better days

Now i stand in sympathy
Not for her but for me
I could have turned i could have stayed
But i just walked away
I could have done a lot of things
In my better days

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days, better days",Better Days
Steve Wiest,"I had all but given up on finding
The one that I could fall into
On the day before you
I was ready settled for
Less than love and not much more
There was no such thing as a dream come true
Oh, but that was all the day before you

Now you're here and everything changes
Suddenly life means so much
I can't wait to wake up tomorrow
And find out this promise is true
I would never have to go back to
The day before you

In your eyes I see forever
Makes me wish that my life never knew
The day before you

The Heaven knows those years without you
Shaping my heart for the that day I found you
You're the reason for all that I've been through
Then I'm thankful for the day before you

Steve Wiest,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You
Steve Wiest,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Steve Wilkerson,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be.

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

If I had to take the choice between the deaf man and the blind

I turned around and knocked them down and walked across the sea

Hadn't traveled very far, when suddenly I saw
Three small ships are sailing out towards a distant shore
So lighting up a cigarette, I followed in pursuit
And found a secret cave, where they obviously stashed their loot

Filling up my pockets, even stuffed it up my nose
I must have weighed a hundred tons between my head and toes
I ventured forth before the dawn, had time to change its mind
And soaring high above the clouds, I found a golden shrine

Laying down my treasure before the iron gate
Quickly rang the bell hoping I hadn't come too late
But someone came along and told me not to waste my time
And when I asked him, who he was, he said, ""Just look behind""

So I turned around and forty thousand headmen hit the dirt
Firing twenty shotguns each and man it really hurt
But luckily for me they had to stop and then reload
And by the time they'd done that I was heading down the road

Heading down the road, forty thousand headmen
Going around the lane, going around the lane, around, around the lane
Forty thousand headmen on my trail, oh",Forty Thousand Headmen

Playing with children, acting as stars

Guiding your visions to heaven
And heaven is in your mind

Take extra care not to lose what you feel
The apple you're eating is simple and real
Water the flowers that grow at your heel

Guiding your visions to heaven
And heaven is in your mind
",Heaven Is in Your Mind
Steve Winwood,"Well, my pad is very messy
And there's whiskers on my chin
And I'm all hung up on music
And I always play to win

I ain't got no time for lovin'
'Cause my time is all used up
Just to sit around creatin'
All that groovy kind of stuff

But I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so

But I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so

Well, if I had my choice of matter
I would rather be with cats
All engrossed in mental chatter
Movin' where our minds are at

And relatin' to each other
Just how strong our wills can be
I'm resisting all involvement
With each groovy chick we see

Well, I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so

But I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so

I got to keep my image
While suspended from a throne
That looks out upon a kingdom
Full of people all unknown

Who imagine I'm not human
And my heart is made of stone
I never had no problems
And my toilet's trimmed with chrome

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so, no no

I'm a man, yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so",I'm a Man

To make you understand
Oh yeah, I'm gonna be your man.

Hey, hey, hey
Everyone is talking about me
It makes me feel so sad.
Hey, hey, hey
Everyone is laughing at me,
It makes me feel so bad,

Steve Winwood,"Well you think you had a good time
With the boy that you just met
Kicking sand from beach to beach
Your clothes all soaking wet
But if you look around and see
A shadow on the run
Don't be too surprised if its just a paper sun

Ahh paper sun, ahh paper sun

In the room where you've been sleeping
All your clothes all thrown about
Cigarettes burn window sills 
Your meter's all run out
But then again its nothing
You just split when day is done
Pitching lips to nowhere, hung up on the paper sun

Standing in the cool of my room
Fresh cut flowers give me sweet perfume
Too much sun will burn!

When you're feeling tired and lonely
You see people going home
You can't make the train fare
Or the six pence for the phone
And icicles your crying 
From your cheek have just begun
Don't be sad, good times are had
Beneath the paper sun

Daylight breaks while you sleep on the sand
A seagull is stealing the ring from your hand
The boy who had given you so much fun
Has left you so cold in the paper sun",Paper Sun
Steve Winwood,"Following the shadows of the skies or are they only figments of my eyes?
And I'm feeling close to where the race is run
Waiting in our boats to set sail, sea of joy
Once the door swings open into space and I'm already waiting in disguise
Or is it just a thorn between my eyes?
Waiting in our boats to set sail, sea of joy
Having trouble coming through, through this concrete, blocks my view
And it's all because of you
Or is it just a thorn between my eyes?
Waiting in our boats to set sail, sea of joy",Sea of Joy
Steve Winwood,"Do yourself a favor
Wake up to your mind
Life is what you make it
You see but still your blind
Get yourself together, give before you take
You'll find out the hard way
Soon you're going to break

Smiling phases, going places
Even when they bust you
Keep on smiling through and through
And you'll be amazed at the gaze on their faces
As they sentence you

You don't need a lawyer
When you're in a fix
Someone gets the pay off
You're friends are full of tricks
How could you love something
That you just can't buy?
Own up to the truth girl
Your mother's gone on by

Your companion, brings you flowers
You just hang him up
And keep him waiting there for hours
And you should just see the look on his face
As you slide down the rail

Steve Winwood,"Struggling with confusion, disillusionment too
Can turn a man into a shadow, crying out from pain?

Through his nightmare vision, he sees nothing, only well
Blind with the beggar's mind, he's but a stranger
He's but a stranger to himself

Suspended from a rope inside a bucket down a hole
His hands are torn and bloodied from the scratching at his soul
",Stranger to Himself
Steve Winwood,"Tell me how you want me to be, then look again and you will see
That I'm still the same love
Think me into any shape, your twisted mind has no escape
But don't be ashamed, love, it's just a game, love
But don't be ashamed, love, it's just a game, love
You can learn how to play
Born like you were in a terrible mess, didn't know what it was to have a new dress
You just wanted to scream out my name
Till somebody said, 'let me take you to bed'
And with money and lies they filled up your head
You were barely thirteen, a child from the villages
So fresh on the scene

And it seems to me
There ain't no [special crime? sense in crying?] in heaven above

There's something about you, I don't know what you got

Where they led us we followed
Two for love-wandering
I look back-here's what I see
We were outside-there was Paris it was raining
And we felt everything
In a crowded street in London happiness
And we were so alive
And your soul was a wide and deep blue sea
I would drown, and you'd rescue me
And we lived our life like a story
Clear to the ending

It was happiness-so clear-happiness
Happiness-no tears-happiness

Can't keep time from its running
Soon the best times are over
Photographs-hold me
And I see how good we were

With no clothes in the sun
In a crowded street in London-happiness

They've plowed, they've sown, they've harrowed him in
Threw clods upon his head
And these three men made a solemn vow
John Barleycorn was dead

They've let him lie for a very long time, 'til the rains from heaven did fall
And little Sir John sprung up his head and so amazed them all
They've let him stand 'til midsummer's day 'til he looked both pale and wan
And little Sir John's grown a long long beard and so become a man
They've hired men with their scythes so sharp to cut him off at the knee
They've rolled him and tied him by the way, serving him most barbarously
They've hired men with their sharp pitchforks who've pricked him to the heart
And the loader he has served him worse than that 
For he's bound him to the cart

They've wheeled him around and around a field 'til they came onto a pond
And there they made a solemn oath on poor John Barleycorn
They've hired men with their crabtree sticks to cut him skin from bone
And the miller he has served him worse than that 
For he's ground him between two stones

And little Sir John and the nut brown bowl and his brandy in the glass
And little Sir John and the nut brown bowl proved the strongest man at last
The huntsman he can't hunt the fox nor so loudly to blow his horn
And the tinker he can't mend kettle or pots without a little barleycorn",John Barleycorn
Steve Winwood,"If you see something that looks like a star
And it's shooting up out of the ground
And your head is spinning from a loud guitar
And you just can't escape from the sound

We were children once, playing with toys
And the thing that you're hearing is only the sound of

By a gun that didn't make any noise
But it wasn't the bullet that laid him to rest was

Steve Winwood,"I bought a sequined suit from a pearly queen
And she could drink more wine than I'd ever seen
She had some gypsies' blood flowing through her feet
And when the time was right she said that I would meet
My destiny

I traveled round the world to find the sun
I couldn't stop myself from having fun
And then one day I met an Indian girl
And she made me forget this troubled world

I had a strange dream. In my hair
I saw a pearly queen lying there
And all around her feet flowers bloomed
But they were made of silk and sequins two by two",Pearly Queen

Where an elephant's eye
Was looking at me
From a bubblegum tree
And all that I knew
The hole in my shoe
Was letting in water (letting in water)

I walked through a field
That just wasn't real
Where 100 tin soldiers
Would shoot at my shoulder
And all that I knew
The hole in my shoe
Was letting in water (letting in water)

(I climbed on the back of a giant albatross
Which flew through a crack in the cloud
To a place where happiness reigned all year round
Where music played ever so loudly)

I started to fall
And suddenly woke
And the dew on the grass
It stuck to my coat
And all that I knew

Steve Winwood,"Forty thousand headmen couldn't make me change my mind
If I had to take the choice between the deaf man and the blind
I know just where my feet should go and that's enough for me
I turned around and knocked them down and walked across the sea

Hadn't traveled very far when suddenly I saw
Three small ships a-sailing all towards a distant shore
So lighting up a cigarette I followed in pursuit
And found a secret cave where they obviously stashed their loot

Filling up my pockets, even stuffed it up my nose
I must have weighed a hundred tons between my head and toes
I ventured forth before the dawn had time to change its mind
And soaring high above the clouds I found a golden shrine

Laying down my treasure before the iron gate
Quickly rang the bell hoping I hadn't come too late
But someone came along and told me not to waste my time
And when I asked him who he was he said, Just look behind

So I turned around and forty thousand headmen bit the dirt
Firing twenty shotguns each and man, it really hurt
But luckily for me they had to stop and then reload
And by the time they'd done that I was heading down the road

And that emotion is healing
And we can fly...

I'll never be that man who threw it all away

Wherever it may take me, I will follow you
There's an answer to all the rain

As we face the day...

So the time has come but I will say a prayer
As the day break, I know I will meet you there
By the shoreline ever-changing
I give my word to you, you gave your word to me

Held you down until you liked the view
Strangers on the street, they mock you
Phantoms in your sleep might shock you But I don't want to be the one to hold you down
I don't want to be the one to turn away
I don't want to play wolf when you call
Cause tears won't help at all Oh, Delilah is the message clear?

Never said I was a saint
The whiskers they betray the greasepaint But I don't want to be the one to hold you down
An d I don't want to be the one to turn away
I don't wanna be the wolf when you call
Cause tears won't help at all (4 times this line) Oh the answer to my greatest fears
Oh the reason for the wasted years
So in love with your own pain
You stay inside and pray for rain
Where losers always win the game
You fall in love with your own shame But I don't want to be the one to hold you down

Steve Wynn,"Everybody's talking about Jesse James
The way he lived and the way he died
But in love, even crime can draw a tighter bind
This is the story of Bonnie and Clyde
In his life, Clyde dreamed of the perfect lover
Until one day his prayers came true
Drawn together like a bow and arrow,
Enter Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow
Passion levels all that it encounters
Like a drug, it needs no rhyme or reason
Blood was spilt and lives were torn asunder
Clyde and Bonnie filled the land with wonder
Fantasies of years they'd spend together,
Shattered by a politician's pledge
Always one step before the gallows
A lust for crime that wouldn't let them rest
Headlines scream
POLICEMAN DEAD IN DALLAS
The long arm of the law was not amused
Brighter shades of love were turning darker
Curtains for Barrow and Bonnie Parker
The thrill is gone and panic takes its place
Hope is growing dimmer by the hour
Flashes of light against the black
Carefully take aim and then attack-tack-tack
The final flickers of a dangerous life
Clyde sees the blood run from his dying wife
Bonnie breathes her last breath in despair
A vision of the corpse of Clyde Barrow
They laid them in the ground before the morning came
To stay together till the end of time
No coffin, no headstone and no marker
The end for Barrow and Bonnie Parker
Bonnie and Clyde, Bonnie and Clyde",Bonnie and Clyde

Steve Wynn,"They say that LA will drop into the sea
Tumbling down where the coastline does curve
The east coast, they look down upon the west
Say the bastards will get what they surely deserve

From fourteenth street to the upper west side
This city could drop in a minute or two
Stunned and surprised but one hell of a ride

When I left LA I was thirty four
Leaving trouble and uncertainty behind
The errors and pitfalls of my youth
To the present, they'd made a neatly drawn line

Which means a rough adolescence can't be far behind

To sneak out and leave by the end of the day
Allegations and confrontations they were hardly feared
We'd just run out of things to say

You'd think at a certain point in your life
You've learned everything that you ever gonna learn
But sparks lead to fires and fire lead to the ashes
At least you know for sure when you've really been burned

I can feel righteous and I can feel nothing but shame
But what does it matter when I end up alone?

Steve Yeager,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Soon begins bewitching me

Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

I met her in a hotel lobby

She said how'd you like to waste some time 
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind

Ahh!

Or maybe it was my brain

But my body will never be the same

Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sho' 'nough sho' 'nough show you how to grind

Was a phone number on the stairs

It's my man

And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me

He isn't good, he isn't true

But I don't care

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

I sing what's in my heart while the music plays;

From this little room to your heart. 
I close my eyes imagining your faces; 
I see the smiles, the tears, the joys, the pain. 
We may be strangers but I can give this song to you, 
Because the One who gave me this song knows your name, 
He knows your name, He knows your name.

Living for the moment letting hours pass right by;
Its gonna take forever to discover all that Jesus has in store,

Sometimes we reach the very top,
We like the feeling of the moment.

Sometimes that's where wed like to stop,
But we've been given these moments
To encourage us along the way.

Whispering a prayer as the people wander in,

But time has stained the windows till no light is shining through;
Those on the outside pass right by,
Lost on a dark endless highway.

Reminding them that Jesus said 'Go into all the world';
They need the Spirit wind to blow again
And fan the flame of concern,

Are blowing this ship so I'll pray again.

Where's the hope you once knew so well?

Look above and beyond what you can see to find a view of all that this life can
Be.

And show you scenes of His mighty strength.
As you rise high above all the riches that this world could give,
You will find the depth of His love,
And His grace that is lifting you up to live.

Because of the love He has shown
And because He has called us to go

Show yourselves to be the ones who follow Me
By the evidence you leave along the way
They'll know that you are mine like the branches on the vine
If you show yourselves to be following me

Faith joins our heats to Him, it's not a result of anything we do
But if we are part of Him, there will be reasons to believe it's true
The fruit cannot help but grow if the branch is joined into the tree
And love cannot help but show in the one who goes where Jesus leads

[Chorus]

Planted in the fertile soil of quiet times
Watered by the rains of trouble, growing toward the sun that shines
They'll know that you are Mine like the branches on the vine
If you show yourselves to be following Me",Show Yourselves to Be
Steven Curtis Chapman,"Anybody in their right mind
Would've given up their preaching and headed for home
They've been warned a hundred times
But something inside them keeps giving them hope
And just when you think they'd be crying
Instead of the tears, there's joy in their eyes

[Chorus]
What kind of joy is this
That counts it a blessing to suffer
What kind of joy is this
That gives the prisoner his song
What kind of joy could stare death in the face
And see it as sweet victory
This is the joy of a soul that's forgiven and free

Anybody else with his pain
Would want to shake their fist at heaven
And give up the fight
'Cause trouble had been Paul's middle name
Ever since he'd been captured by God's blinding light
But just when his hope should be dying
If you listen you'll hear him singing a song

[Chorus]

What kind of joy is this
The Father has promised his children
What kind of joy is this
That Jesus has come to reveal
What kind of joy could give hope in this world
To someone just like you and me
This is the joy of a soul that's forgiven and free
I've found this joy for my soul is forgiven and free",What Kind of Joy

I will go with you into the battlefield
And when the arrows start to fly
Take my hand and hold on tight
I will be your shield, cause I know how it feels
When you are a soldier

When you're tired from running 
I will cheer you on
Look beside you and you'll see you're not alone
And when your strength is all but gone
I'll carry you until you're strong

Steven Curtis Chapman,"I saw you staring out your window
Watchin' the people passing by
Taking some notes on what you saw out there
So you would know how hard you need to try

I heard you asking lots of questions
How in comparison you stand
Please let me warn you to be very careful

You know better than, better than that
You should know better, truth is the only measure

And if you're feeling like I do
Maybe it's time we open up the Holy Bible

This is my heart's cry 
This is my heart's cry 
Much more than just a great desire - it's like a fire in me 
I hear my heart cry each time I think about the cross where Jesus died 

The cross should have been mine but His love broke through time 
And heard my heart's cry - he heard my heart's cry 
Now every other hope and dream is lost inside of this one thing 
To know the one who died for me and live my life for Jesus Christ

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Maria, she's too young to understand
But old enough to feel the pain
Of living where no love can grow
With no hope for change

Maria, her world is an angry place
But she makes sure that scars don't show
And with every hurt
Her tender heart is growing cold

Who, who's gonna love Maria
Who, who's gonna touch her
With the tenderness she longs for
Like a desert longs for rain

She's got a hunger deep inside
With every tear she cries
She wonders if there's
Someone out there, somewhere
Who's gonna love Maria

She looks in the mirror now
And the little girl is gone
But still the search for
Someone's love goes on and on for Maria

But does anybody care
Or even notice her at all
Is anyone listening close enough
To hear her call

And who, who's gonna love Maria
Who, who's gonna touch her
With the tenderness she longs for
Like a desert longs for rain

She's got a hunger deep inside
And with every tear she cries
She wonders if there's someone out there

Maria if you can hear me
Please know that you're not forgotten
Somebody's trying to get to you

Who's gonna love Maria
Who, who's gonna touch her
With the tenderness she longs for
Like a desert longs for rain

She's got a hunger deep inside
And with every tear she cries
She wonders if there's
Someone out there, somewhere
Who's gonna love Maria

Who's gonna love Maria
And who's gonna take her time to hear her calling
And wipe away the tears that falling for Maria
Who's gonna love Maria

Steven Curtis Chapman,"A gentle breeze was blowing
The air was heavenly sweet
Life was so complete
In a picture perfect garden
While the sun went down
You could hear the sound

Of a man and woman crying
Saying what have we done
We made our choice and now we're dying
And we've got to leave this place
And hide from God's face

But this is where we belong
Where you and I were meant to be from now on
Made by the Father to live in His love
It's the purpose and plan for the heart of man
This is where we belong

The warm winds of change were blowing
After years and years of hopeless tears
One man became the doorway
That would lead back to
The place where life was new

A place just like the garden
Where we walk and talk with God
The way creation started
Where each heart and soul
Can come and be whole

This is where we belong
Where you and I were meant to be all along
Made by the Father to live in His love
It's the purpose and plan for the heart of man

Like a fish belongs in the water
Just like children you and I

Steven Curtis Chapman,"In the spring of 1519 a Spanish fleet set sail
Cortez told his sailors this mission must not fail
On the eastern shore of Mexico they landed with great dreams
But the hardships of the new world make them restless and weak

Quietly they whispered, ""Let's sail back to the life we knew""
But the one who led them there was saying

""Burn the ships we're here to stay
There's no way we could go back
Now that we've come this far by faith
Burn the ships we've passed the point of no return
Our life is here so let the ships burn and burn""

In the spring of new beginnings a searching heart set sail
Looking for a new life and a love that would not fail
On the shores of grace and mercy we landed with great joy
But an enemy was waiting to steal, kill, and destroy

Quietly he whispers, ""Go back to the life you know""
But the one who led us here is saying

""Burn the ships we're here to stay
There's no way we could go back
Now that we've come this far by faith
Burn the ships we've passed the point of no return
Our life is here so let the ships burn and burn""

Nobody said it would be easy
But the one who brought us here
Is never gonna leave us alone

Never gonna leave, never gonna leave
Never gonna leave, never gonna leave
Never gonna leave

Burn the ships we're here to stay
There's no way we could go back
Now that we've come this far by faith

I'm just givin' my opinion with a rhythm and a clever rhyme
I don't want these words to sound
Like I think I've got it all figured out

I know there's a God who knows my name
And a Son who died to take the blame
I believe that Jesus is coming back

Just keep it loose, you're free to choose

Kind and good and full of faith
Self-controlled and gentle
Oh the heart of heaven beats this way

I pulled up to the stop sign and I saw him standing there
The cardboard sign he held said he was hungry

As if to say, I'd help but I'm in such a hurry
These are the moments of truth
What would love have me do

Oh, heartbeat of heaven, I want my life to show
The kind of love that comes and goes

I know at times this heart of mine beats only for itself
Full of thoughts and dreams, plans and problems
But this heart beating here in me belongs to someone else

With too many irons in the fire and too much on my plate

What I see is telling me I'm going crazy, but
What is real says God's still on His throne
What I need is to remember one thing
That the Lord of the gentle breeze is Lord of the rough and tumble
And He is King of the Jungle Yes he is

People say this world's a jungle and sometimes I must admit
I'd be scared to death if I did not know who was king of it
But the truth is God created this whole world with His own hand
So everything is under His command

That heartsick look in your eyes
You hide it very well, but I've got the same disguise
I know from all you see around you
You feel worth a very small price
So plain and ordinary, but there's a pearl inside

And if you look in the mirror in the light of the truth
You'll see there's really nothing you could say or do
To make you worth more to the One who made you

CHORUS
Your are a treasure
Worth more than anything under the sun or the moon
God's greatest treasure
Is the treasure of you

The rich man treasures gold and silver
The wise man, his knowledge of truth
Some will hold to memories and some will cling to youth
But the one who carved out the oceans
And painted the stars in the sky
You are His prized creation, the apple of His eye
There's no one else in the world who could take your place
Just the thought of you brings a smile to His face
God loves you with amazing grace

God made everything and everything He made
More than anything He treasures you and me

The will ever make God care more than He does for the treasure

Steven Curtis Chapman,"In a one bedroom apartment
On the humble side of town
There stands a little Christmas tree
It looks a lot like Charlie Brown's

And underneath there's one little gift for him
And one little gift for her

After six months on the new job
They're still barely getting by
So in the way of decorations
There's nothing there to catch your eye

But both of them would be the first to say
We're together, we're gonna have the merriest Christmas anyway

'Cause Christmas is all in the heart
That's where the feeling starts
And like a fire inside, it touches every part
Christmas is all in the heart

And even if no white snow falls
Well, that's all right because
The joy can still be found, wherever you are
Christmas is all, all in the heart

Two little blond haired boys with big dreams
Tried to sleep but sleep wouldn't come
And we'd be tearing into presents
Long before the break of dawn

With mom and dad and cameras making sure
We'd never forget that day, no, no, no

Now I'm the one who's taking pictures
In the middle of the night
Of my own little dreamers
That just can't wait until daylight

And in my sleepy eyes the spark still glows
Well, I guess there's just some things a kid never outgrows

'Cause Christmas is all in the heart
That's where the feeling starts
And like a fire inside, it touches every part
Christmas is all in the heart

And even if no white snow falls
Well, that's all right because
The joy can still be found, wherever you are
Christmas is all, all in the heart

No, it's not in the snow that may or may not fall
And it's not in the gifts around the tree
It's in the love Heaven gave, that night our Savior came
And that same love can still be found wherever you are

'Cause Christmas is all in the heart
And the joy can still be found, wherever you are
'Cause Christmas is all, all in the heart
It's all in the heart

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Her house was where the family gathered every Christmas eve
A feast was set on the table and gifts were placed beneath the tree
Everything was picture perfect, Grandpa would laugh and say
That woman spends the whole year getting ready for this day

One year the leaves began to fall and her health began to fade
We moved her to a place where they could watch her night and day
But she kept making plans for Christmas from her little room
She told everyone, I'll miss you but I'll be leaving soon

I'm going home for Christmas and I'm going home to stay
I'm going home for Christmas and nothing's gonna keep me away
I'll be with the ones I love to celebrate the Savior's birth
This gift will be worth more to me than anything on earth
I'm going home, home for Christmas

All the leaves outside have fallen to be covered by the snow
The family comes with food and gifts and Grandpa comes alone
There's a sadness in our silence as the Christmas story's read
And with tears, Grandpa reminds us of the words that Grandma said

I'm going home for Christmas and I'm going home to stay
I'm going home for Christmas and nothing's gonna keep me away
She'll be face to face with Jesus as we celebrate His birth
And this gift will be worth more to her than anything on earth
'Cause she'll be home

And as we sing 'Joy to the World' I can't help thinking
Of the joy that's in her eyes right now
And though our hearts still ache, we know that as we celebrate
She's singing with the herald angels and heaven's glowing on her face

And now she's home for Christmas and now she's home to stay
She's home for Christmas, and nothin' could've kept her away

And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Oh what a gift of love;
An angel tells a virgin that
She's gonna have a son.
And though it's a precious promise,
She wonders how can this be;
What will the people say
And what if Joseph can't believe.
And her questions and her fears
Are met with an overwhelming joy
That God has chosen her.
Oh what a precious promise;
Mary waits as heaven comes to earth.

Oh what a precious promise,
Oh what a gift of love;
Joseph makes his choice to do
What few men would have done:
To take Mary as his bride,
When she's already carrying a child
That isn't his own.
Oh what a precious promise;
Mary and the child will have a home.

And shepherds stand on a hillside,
Their hearts racing with the news the angel told them;
A star's light fills up the dark sky,
As the night of precious promise is unfolding.

Oh what a precious promise,
Oh what a gift of love;
The waiting now is over and
The time has finally come.
For the God who made this world
To roll back the curtain
And unveil His passion for the heart of man.

Did all the things that babies do;
He rocked and He napped on His mother's lap,
And He wiggled and giggled and cooed.
There were the cheers when He took His first step,
And the tears when He got His first teeth;
Almost everything about this little baby
Seemed as natural as it could be.

But this baby made the angels sing,
And this baby made a new star shine in the sky.
This baby had come to change the world.
This baby was God's own son, this baby was like no other one.
This baby was God with us, this baby was Jesus.

And this baby grew into a young boy,
Who learned to read and write and wrestle with dad;
There was the climbin' of trees and the scrapin' of knees,
And all the fun that a boy's born to have.
He grew taller and some things started changing,
Like His complexion and the sound of His voice;
There was work to be done as a carpenter's son
And all the neighbors said He's such a fine boy.

But this boy made the angels sing,
And this boy made a new star shine in the sky.
This boy had come to change the world.
This boy was God's own son, this boy was like no other one.
This boy was God with us. This boy became a man,

And love made Him laugh and death made Him cry.
With the life that He lived and the death that He died,
He showed us heaven with His hands and His heart,
'Cause this man was God's own son.
This man was like no other one,
Holy and human right from the start.

The sun was beating down inside 
The walls of stone and razor wire
As we made our way across the prison yard
I felt my heart begin to race 
As we drew nearer to the place
Where they say that death 
Is waiting in the dark
The slamming doors of iron 
Echoed through the halls
Where despair holds life 
Within its cruel claws 

But then I met a man 
Whose face seemed so 
Strangely out of place
A blinding light of hope 
Was shining in his eyes
And with repentance in his voice 
He told me of his tragic choice
That led him to this place 
where he must pay the price

But then his voice grew strong 
As he began to tell
About the one he said 
Had rescued him from Hell, he said

I'm free, yeah, oh, 
I have been forgiven
God's love has taken off my chains, 
And given me these wings
And I am free, yeah, yeah 
And the freedom I've been given 
Is something that not even 
Death can take away from me
Because I'm free

And tears began to fill my eyes
As I stepped back out into the blinding sun
And even as I drove away I found 
That I could not escape 
The way he spoke of what 
The grace of God had done
I thought about how sin 
Had sentenced us to die
And how God gave His only Son 
So you and I could say

I'm free, yeah, oh, 
I have been forgiven
God's love has taken off my chains, 
And given me these wings
And I am free, yeah, yeah 
And the freedom I've been given 
Is something that not even 
Death can take away from me

Oh if the Son has set you free
Than you are free indeed, 
Oh, you are really free

If the Son has set you free
Oh if the Son has set you free
Than you are free, really, really free, oh

We're free, yeah, 
Oh we have been forgiven
God's grace has broken every chain, 
And given us these wings

And we're free, yeah,

Steven Curtis Chapman,"I have come to this ocean
And the waves of fear are starting to grow
The doubts and questions are rising with the tide
So I'm clinging to the one sure thing I know

I will hold on to the hand of my Savior
And I will hold on with all my might
I will hold loosely to things that are fleeting
And hold on to Jesus, I will hold on to Jesus for life

I've tried to hold many treasures
They just keep slipping through my fingers like sand
But there's one treasure that means more than breath itself
So I'm clinging to it with everything I am

I will hold on to the hand of my Savior
And I will hold on with all my might
I will hold loosely to things that are fleeting
And hold on to Jesus, I will hold on to Jesus for life

Like a child holding on to a promise
I will cling to His word and believe
As I press on to take hold of that
For which Christ Jesus took hold of me

So I will hold on to the hand of my Savior
And I will hold on with all my might
I will hold loosely to things that are fleeting
And hold on to Jesus for life
I will hold on to Jesus for life
I'll hold on to Jesus, I will hold on to Jesus for life

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Let Us Pray
1 Thess 5:17, Col 4:2, Eph 6:18, Heb 4:16, Rom 12:12

I hear you say your heart is aching
You've got trouble in the making
And you ask if I'll be praying for you please
And in keeping with convention
I'll say yes with good intentions
To pray later making mention of your needs
But since we have this moment here at heaven's door
We should start knocking now, what are we waiting for?

Let us pray, let us pray, everywhere in every way
Every moment of the day, it is the right time
For the Father above, He is listening with love
And He wants to answer us, so let us pray

So when we feel the Spirit moving
Prompting, prodding and behooving
There is no time to be losing, let us pray
Let the Father hear us saying
What we need to be conveying
Even while this song is playing, let us pray
And just because we say the word, ""Amen""
It doesn't mean this conversation needs to end

Let us pray, let us pray, everywhere in every way
Every moment of the day, it is the right time
Let us pray without end and when we finish start again
Like breathing out and breathing in, let us pray

Let us approach the throne of grace with confidence
As our prayers draw us near
To the One who knows our needs
Before we even call His name

Let us pray, let us pray, everywhere in every way
Every moment of the day, it is the right time
For the Father above, He is listening with love
And He wants to answer us, so let us pray

Steven Curtis Chapman,"On the bank of a Tennessee River
In a small Kentucky town
I drew my first breath one cold November morning
And before my feet even touched the ground
With the doctors and the nurses gathered 'round
I started to dance
I started to dance

A little boy full of wide-eyed wonder
Footloose and fancy free
But it would happen, as it does for every dancer
That I'd stumble on a truth I couldn't see
And find a longing deep inside of me, it said

I am the heart, I need the heartbeat
I am the eyes, I need the sight
I realize that I am just a body
I need the life
I move my feet, I go through the motions
But who'll give purpose to chance
I am the dancer
I need the Lord of the dance

The world beneath us spins in circles
And this life makes us twist and turn and sway
But we were made for more than rhythm with no reason
By the one who moves with passion and with grace
As He dances over all that He has made

I am the heart, He is the heartbeat
I am the eyes, He is the sight
And I see clearly, I am just a body
He is the life
I move my feet, I go through the motions
But He gives purpose to chance
I am the dancer
He is the Lord of the dance

Lord of the dance
Lord of the dance

And while the music of his love and mercy plays
I will fall down on my knees and I will pray

I am the heart, You are the heartbeat
I am the eyes, You are the sight
And I see clearly, I am just a body
You are the life
I move my feet, I go through the motions
But You give purpose to chance
I am the dancer
You are the Lord of the dance

I am the eyes, You are the sight
And I see clearly, I am just a body

He gave thirty years to the lumber yard
Loving his family and working hard
Got a faith like a solid rock
He's just doing the walk, yeah

I've got a friend named Larry
He sends me letters from a foreign land
He moved there with his kids and his pretty wife Mary
To answer the holy call
He's just doing the walk

You can fly with the eagle
You can jump through all the hoops
And climb the ladder to the top
But when it all comes down
You know it all comes down to the walk
It all come down to the walk

Now there's a man I know
He said He'd come to show us the way
He died on a cross and He rose from the grave
And proved He was more than talk
He taught us the walk, yes He did

And now I'm singing my songs
Standing up on a big and bright stage, yeah
And I do my dance while the music plays

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Another case of I wish I wouldn't have;
Another promise not to let Him down again.
Fighting battles in a war I thought was over;
The old man of sin died a long time ago,
But left behind a sinful nature deep within,
So if I want to win this fight,
There's a part of me that must die,
But I'm not gonna cry.

[Chorus:]
'Cause I'm dying to live,
Live for Jesus.
Dying to give myself to Him,
And the life that He gives will be mine
If I am dying to live.
Dying to live,
Live for Jesus.
I want to give myself to Him;
Gonna give up - from now on I'm dying to live.
Giving up what I can't keep anyway,
To gain something that I know I'll never lose,
Trading in the temporary for the eternal,
And though it's settled, I'm reminded everyday;
To live or die to self - it's up to me to choose,
So if I want to win the fight there's a part of me
That must die.
Well I've said my goodbyes.

[Chorus]",Dying to Live

And I need to find a shelter
Before it starts to rain,
So I turn and run to you Lord;
You're the only place to go,
Where unfailing love surrounds me
When I need it most.

[Chorus:]
You're my hiding place;
Safe in your embrace,
I'm protected from the storm that rages
When the waters rise,
And I run to hide;
Lord, in You I find my hiding place.
I'm not asking You to take away
My troubles, Lord,
'Cause it's through the stormy weather
I learn to trust You more.
So I thank You for Your promise;
I have come to know
Your unfailing love surrounds me
When I need it most.

While You may be found,
'Cause You're our only refuge

My Redeemer is faithful and true. 
Everything He has said He will do, 
And every morning His mercies are new.

I know someday I'll see my Lord face to face,

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Strolling past temptation avenue, 
You hear so many voices calling you; 
Maybe you'll step in and take a quick look around. 
Try to walk through it, 
And you're gonna fall down. 

[CHORUS ]
You've gotta run away, 
Turn around and run the other way; 
Don't even look in the direction 
of a thought you should not entertain. 
You've gotta run away, 
It's a prison that is calling your name; 
You just can't win if you play, 
So run away. 
There comes a time when you must stand and fight, 
When the darkness tries to overcome the light; 
But sin that is dressed up in the color of gray, 
Is only defeated 
When we run away. 

(chorus) 

Don't put yourself in that position 
Where sin can make it's proposition; 
And if you find that you have fallen, 
You gotta get up, get ready to run 
Next time sin comes calling, calling.

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Another rainy Monday, 
Looks like I'm gonna be late again; 
Why does the race I'm runnin' never seem to have an end. 
A day away from Sunday, 
Feels like I'm already losing ground - 
Funny sometimes how quickly my emotions get turned around; 
They're letting me down. 

[CHORUS] 
I gotta keep my eyes on Jesus 
Through the weak days; 
In a world where we really don't belong, 
I've discovered if I keep my eyes on Jesus 
Through the weak days, 
Then even on the weak days He'll make me strong. 
The spirit is so willing 
When the fellowship is so sweet; 
How soon all the good intentions 
Find the flesh is weak. 
But there's a power waiting, 
With no limits to times or space; 
All of our doubts and fears disappear without a trace 
When we look on His face. 

(chorus) 

And when we keep our eyes on Jesus, 
We'll gladly follow where He leads us.

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Jimmy and Mary were quite a pair back in their younger days
They met a married in six weeks time and
That was sixty years ago this May
Four kids made a house a home and a love for Jesus kept them strong
Now every morning at eight A.M. Jimmy takes a drive through town
He spends his days at Mary's side In a home for the old and broken down
With a cane in his lap and a Bible in his hand He reads her stories about the promised land
And with tears in their eyes they dream of a place Where everything changes in the light of Jesus' face and

CHORUS
That's paradise... Hey, that's paradise...
When the life breaks through and the old's made new And the joy will never die, that's paradise

In another corner of this world, met another man named Jim
Told me how twenty years of running from God Had finally gotten the best of him
He said all hope was gone and he wanted to die 'Cause what could God do with such a messed up guy
So we talked about Jesus, God's love and His plan And when Jim walked away he was a brand new man

(Chorus)

Now listen, Well I know the best remains to be seen In a place that's far beyond our wildest dreams
But until we see heaven we've got Jesus' world That He'll never leave us and each prayer will be heard

Steven Curtis Chapman,"I didn't come lookin' for trouble
And I don't want to fight needlessly
But I'm not gonna hide in a bubble

I can feel my heart beating faster
I can tell something's coming down

Let the lightning flash, let the thunder roll, let the storm winds blow
Bring it on
Let the trouble come, let the hard rain fall, let it make me strong

Now, maybe you're thinkin' I'm crazy
And maybe I need to explain some things
'Cause I know I've got an enemy waiting
Who wants to bring me pain
But what he never seems to remember
What he means for evil God works for good
So I will not retreat or surrender

Now, I don't want to sound like some hero
'Cause it's God alone that my hope is in
But I'm not gonna run from the very things
That would drive me closer to Him

And I keep looking for a way to fix it all
But we know we're at the mercy of God's higher ways
And our ways are so small

But I will carry you to Jesus
He is everything you need
I will carry you to Jesus on my knees

It's such a privilege for me to give this gift to you

Is to know that you'll be there to do the same for me

And if you need to cry go on and I, I will cry along with you, yeah

Just like a dead man who's been given breath again
And though this path can still grow 
Dark with tears and sorrow
I know he will never leave me

I will look into his face
And then I'll look for you

On the things I once called certain
And I have to say the words I fear the most

And the questions without answers
Come and paralyze the dancer
So I stand here on the stage afraid to move
Afraid to fall, oh, but fall I must
On this truth that my life has been formed from the dust

God is God and I am not
I can only see a part of the picture He's painting
God is God and I am man
So I'll never understand it all
For only God is God

And the sky begins to thunder
And I'm filled with awe and wonder
'Til the only burning question that remains
Is who am I

Can I form a single mountain
Take the stars in hand and count them
Can I even take a breath without God giving it to me
He is first and last before all that has been
Beyond all that will pass

How unsearchable for to Him and through Him and from Him are all things

Steven Curtis Chapman,"6:30 Monday morning
I'm here hiding in my bed
A song plays on my alarm clock
As I cover up my head
But somewhere in the distance
I remember yesterday
Singing ""Hallelujah""
Full of wonder, awe and grace
But now I'm just wondering
Why I don't feel anything
At all

This is a moment made for worshipping
Cause this is a moment I'm alive
And this is a moment I was made to sing
A song of living sacrifice
For every moment that I live and breathe
This is a moment made for worshipping

When I'm praying with my children
As they're running off to school
When I kiss my wife good morning
Just to say I still love you
When I'm feeling love and happy
When I'm feeling all alone
When I'm failing to remember
All the love that I've been shown
Every single beat of my heart
Is another new place to start
To know

This is a moment made for worshipping
Cause this is a moment I'm alive
And this is a moment I was made to sing
A song of living sacrifice
For every moment that I live and breathe
This is a moment made for worshipping

Every single beat of my heart
Is another new place to start
Right now

This is a moment made for worshipping
Cause this is a moment I'm alive
And this is a moment I was made to sing
A song of living sacrifice
For every moment that I live and breathe
This is a moment made for worshipping

From the rising of the sun
To the setting the sun
The name of the Lord is worthy to be praised



",Moment Made for Worshipping
Steven Curtis Chapman,"Deep in the jungle, up in a tree
In Indiana 1983
Living on pizza and too little sleep
Just me and my animal friends
Then in the distance I saw through the leaves
Creature of beauty like none I had even seen
The trouble started when you smiled at me
And our two worlds came crashing together
And true love slowly began

I am Tarzan, You are Jane
I am the night, and you are the day
We're like sunshine and rain
We're so different from each other
You are a woman, I am a man
You're the sea, and I am the land
And I would not be who I am
If I didn't have you

I know that somedays we both wonder how
We got together, we're still so different now
But I can't imagine my life without you
Cause all those things that make us so different
Are just what make us all that we are

I am Tarzan, You are Jane
I am the night, and you are the day
We're like sunshine and rain
We're so different from each other
You are a woman, I am a man
You are the sea, and I am the land
And I would not be who I am
If I didn't have you

We belong together



",We Belong Together (Tarzan and Jane)
Steven Curtis Chapman,"I've watched the sunrise in your eyes
And I've seen the tears fall like the rain
You've seen me fight so brave and strong
You've held my hand when I'm afraid

We've watched the seasons come and go
We'll see them come and go again
But in winter's chill, or summer's breeze
One thing will not be changin'

We will dance
When the sun is shining
In the pouring rain
We'll spin and we'll sway
And we will dance
When the gentle breeze
Becomes a hurricane
The music will play
And I'll take your hand
And hold you close to me
And we will dance

Sometimes it's hard to hold you tight
Sometimes we feel so far apart
Sometimes we dance as one
And feel the beating of each others hearts

Some days the dance is slow and sweet
Some days we're bouncing off the walls
No matter how this world may turn
Our love will keep us from fallin'

And we will dance
When the sun is shining
In the pouring rain
We'll spin and we'll sway
And we will dance
When the gentle breeze
Becomes a hurricane
The music will play
And I'll take your hand
And hold you close to me
And we will dance

The music will play
And I'll hold you close
And I won't let you go
Even when our steps
Grow weak and slow
Still I'll take your hand
And hold you close to me
And we, will dance



",We Will Dance
Steven Curtis Chapman,"(verse 1:)

Well, I still remember the first time
I felt the power of your kiss
It hit me like a bolt of lightning
I said, ""I never will recover from this""
And like the words from the mouth of a prophet
I have lived to see those words come true
Just look at me now, I'm still reeling

Chorus:

With every little kiss I'm reminded
How wonderful it is to be in love with you
With every little look
With every little touch
With every little kiss

(verse 2:)

Like a moth being drawn to a candle
This is something that I can't resist
I guess you could say I'm addicted
'Cause I keep coming back again and again
And after all of the storms that we've weathered
All the seasons of change we've been through
Somehow the flame keeps getting brighter
You give me just a little taste of heaven
Just one more good gift that God has given
I don't want to miss one single little kiss



",With Every Little Kiss
Steven Curtis Chapman,"One day you've got me laughing
One day you've got me crying
One day you've got me thinking
I'm going out of my mind
But one thing is true
The one thing that never changes
Is that you've always got me ...

On a Monday, on a Tuesday, on a Wednesday
All the way around 'til Sunday
You've always got me on the good days
And the bad days and the mad days
The happy and the sad days
You've got me every day of my life

One night you've got candles burning
One night your head is aching
Most night you've got several hundred things
Still on you list to get to get done
One thing stays true
One thing that you can know for certain
Is that you've always got me

On a Monday
On a Tuesday
On a Wednesday
All the way up to Sunday
You've always got me
On the good days
And the bad days
And the mad days
The happy and the sad days
You've got me every day of my life

You've always got me
You've always got me by your side
You've always got me
Every single day of my life
You've always got me
You've always got me by your side
You've always got me

One thing stays true
One thing that you can know for certain
Is that you've always got me



",You've Got Me
Steven Curtis Chapman,"So here we are we're standin' face to face
And yet we seem to be a million miles apart
This world can feel like such a lonely place
It all depends on what you see from where you are
So please, please tell me what you can
'Cause I want to understand

How does it look from your side?
How does it look from where you are?
How does it look from your side
From your side of the world?

So tell me the color of your sky above
Paint me a picture of the things that make you smile
Show me your fears and what you're dreaming of
Take me to where my heart can see across the miles
And please, please tell me what you can
'Cause I want to understand

How does it look from your side?
How does it look from where you are?
How does it look from your side
From your side of the world?

Don't be surprised to find I'm not too far away
'Cause what we are both in search of is one and the same
So please, please tell me what you see
'Cause I really want to be the one who understands



",Your Side of the World
Steven Curtis Chapman,"You spoke and made the sunrise, to light up the very first day 
You breathed across the water, and started the very first wave 
It was You 
You introduced Your glory, to every living creature on earth 
And they started singing, the first song to ever be heard 
They sang for You 

You make all things new 
You make all things new 

Then the world was broken, fallen and battered and scarred 
You took the hopeless, the life, wasted, ruined and marred
And made it new 

You make all things new

You redeem and You transform 
You renew and You restore 
You make all things new

And forever we will watch and worship You 

You turn winter into spring 
You take every living thing 
And You breathe Your breath of life into it over and over again 

You make the sunrise, day after day after day 
But there's a morning coming, when old things will all pass away 
And everyone will see

And did He cry about the flood?

To show me things the angels long to look into
And I know things the Angels only wish they knew

I've felt loneliness and shame
And I have watched the blinding light of grace

So many dreams to get to this moment 
Now this is where we stay 
While you go change the world

A song the very God who made you 
Has been singing all along

Watching o'er your flocks by night,

Yonder shines the infant light

Come and worship, Christ the newborn king.

Come and worship, Christ the newborn king.

Sinners, wrung with true repentance,
Doomed for guilt to endless pains,
Justice now revokes the sentence,
Mercy calls you, break your chains

Come and worship, Christ the newborn king.

Though an Infant now we view Him,
He shall fill His Father's throne,
Gather all the nations to Him;
Every knee shall then bow down:

All creation, join in praising
God, the Father, Spirit, Son,
Evermore your voices raising
To th'eternal Three in One.

But the song that You give?
I have nothing to bring
That did not come from Your hands

So here I am with all I have

And I'm giving it all back to You
All back to You, I surrender
Yeah, I'm giving it all back to You
All back to You, this is my surrender

Steven Curtis Chapman,"He's got a Bible and a megaphone standing on the corner
And everybody's saying he's crazy
Well, does he really think anybody wants to hear
What he has to say?

He's not screaming at anybody, in fact it's as if it's a love story
That he's trying to tell them
And he knows it may look a little strange
But he just smiles and says, ""That's okay
'Cause you know sometimes love makes you act that way?

And it's crazy when love gets a hold of you
And it's crazy things that love will make you do
And it's crazy but it's true, you really don't know love at all
?Til it's making you do something crazy

I know a lady in Uganda, forty kids call her momma
And everybody thought it was crazy
She used to drive a Beemer but I've never seen her
Any happier than she is now

I've met them all around the world, they're the boys and the girls
Filled up with the love of the Father
And they know it may look a little strange
But they just smile and say, ""That's alright
?Cause love puts everything in a different light?

And it's crazy when love gets a hold of you
And it's crazy things that love will make you do
And it's crazy but it's true, you really don't know love at all
?Til it's making you do something crazy

Crazy
Crazy when love gets a hold of you
Crazy, crazy
Crazy thing that love will make you do, crazy

Well, some might say it's a crazy thing
To believe in a man who would say He came
From Heaven down to earth because of love
But I just smile and say, ""That's okay
?Cause you know sometimes love makes you act that way?

And it's crazy when love gets a hold of you
And it's crazy things that love will make you do
And it's crazy but it's true, you really don't know love at all
?Til it's making you do

Crazy when love gets a hold of you
And it's crazy things that love will make you do
And it's crazy but it's true, you really don't know love at all
Until it's making you do something crazy

Steven Curtis Chapman,"I walk the streets of London
And notice in the faces passing by
Something that makes me stop and listen
My heart grows heavy with the cry

Where is the hope for London?
You whisper and my heart begins to soar
As I'm reminded
Every street in London in Yours, oh yes, it is

I walk the dirt roads of Uganda
I see the scars that war has left behind
Hope like the sun is fading
They're waiting for a cure no one can find

And I hear children's voices singing
Of a God who heals and rescues and restores
And I'm reminded
That every child in Africa is Yours

And it's all Yours, God, Yours, God
Everything is Yours
From the stars in the sky
To the depths of the ocean floor

And it's all Yours, God, Yours, God
Everything is Yours
You're the Maker and Keeper
Father and Ruler of everything, it's all Yours

And I walk the sidewalks of Nashville
Like Singapore, Manila and Shanghai
I brush by the beggar's hand and the wealthy man
And everywhere I look I realize

That just like the streets of London
For every man and woman, boy and girl
All of creation
This is our Father's world

And it's all Yours, God, Yours, God
Everything is Yours
From the stars in the sky
To the depths of the ocean floor

Steven Curtis Chapman,"Sometimes you wanna laugh, sometimes you wanna cry;
You're just not good enough no matter how hard you try,
So you go on, but do you know something's wrong.
You meant it when you asked Him in down on your knees;
Somehow you lost the thrill and thrills are what you need,
To let you know where you're gonna go.
You struggle on trying to earn what He's given you.
You struggle on; He died to give it, what more can you do.

CHORUS
So consider it, consider it done;
The prize you're fighting for is already won.
So consider it, consider it done;
You'll find His work's just begun
When you consider it done.

God helps the ones who help themselves, some people say,
But are we helping out or getting in His way.
He wants our best and Hell do the rest;
It's by His grace we're saved,
Not by the things we do,
So we've got to serve Him with a thankful attitude
And let Him know where He leads we'll go.
From this day on our hope's in Jesus and His work's complete.
From this day on, He makes His experience our history.

Steven Curtis Chapman,"The long awaited rains
Have fallen hard upon the thirsty ground
And carved their way to where
The wild and rushing river can be found
And like the rains
I have been carried here to where the river flows

My heart is racing and my knees are weak
As I walk to the edge
I know there is no turning back
Once my feet have left the ledge
And in the rush I hear a voice
That's telling me it's time to take the leap of faith

And it may feel like 40 long days in a hard driving rain
Or 40 years in a dry desert sand
But when He’s finished we will SEE
A beautiful tapestry
And know that nothing has been wasted in the end
Oh, and God will, He will finish what He started
No thread will be unwoven
Nothing will be left undone
Every plan and every purpose
That He has will be accomplished
And God will finish what He’s begun
And we’ll stand as the ones completed
By the miracle of His love
We’ll sing of His goodness and sing to His glory
As we tell the story of how
God has, He has finished what He’s started
Not a thread will be unwoven
And nothing will be left undone

And God will finish what He’s begun

Steven Curtis Chapman,"There’s a little boy looking at me in the mirror
He’s asking where the time has gone
Was it here just long enough to draw these lines on my face?
Well I’m not sure I’m much wiser
But some things are clearer
And it’s getting clear that I’m not here for long
So what am I to do with my few minutes here in this place?
And we hear the world sigh with its aches and its pains
We see the grass wither and watch flowers fade

But oh, there’s a day that is coming
When everything will be new
And oh, God will dry every tear
And everything sad will be made untrue
And oh, it’s gonna be a celebration
All of creation longs for
And while we’re waiting for that day to come
We’ve got a little more time to love

There are little ones hungry for love of a family
So many hungry for bread
On the left and the right surrounded by the last and the least
And just down the street and just across the table
Hungry hearts are waiting to be fed
‘Cause deep in our soul we’re all longing to be at The Feast
But until we sit down where there’s more than enough
Let us give as we’ve been given and love as we’ve been loved

There’s a day that is coming
When all the last will be first
Every orphan will be home
And all will be filled who hunger and thirst
It’s gonna be a celebration
All of creation longs for
And while we’re waiting for that day to come
We’ve got a little more time

To do justly and love mercy
And show the love we’ve been shown
For we can only be the hands and feet of Jesus ‘til 
He leads us home
He will lead us home

There’s a day that is coming
A day that never will end
There in the light of His glory
Everything broken will be whole again
And this will be the celebration

There is music in your laughter the world has never heard before
You came and brought a melody
The way you say it the way you see it

All these gifts only you can bring
Still I know that right now everything that you feel says it’s just not true

And here we are living in the middle of it all

Steven Davis,"If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy

Nothing else would matter in the world today
We could go on loving in the same old way
A garden of Eden, just made for two
With nothing to mar our joy

I would say such wonderful things to you
There would be such wonderful things to do
If you were the only girl in the world
And I were the only boy

Steven Davis,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When
Steven Delopoulos,"Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a slow torch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning

So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

[Chorus]
Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded
Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just drownin' in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

Everything is cut and dry
Day and night, earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

[Chorus]

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughin' at the rain
Little out of touch, little insane
Just easier than dealing with the pain

Runaway train never comin' back
Runaway train tearin' up the track
Runaway train burnin' in my veins
Runaway but it always seems the same",Runaway Train
Steven Falcon,"How can I just let you walk away,
Just let you leave without a trace?
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Take a look at me now

Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face, oh

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And it's what I've got to face
Take a look at me now",Against All Odds
Steven Halpern,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window 
Staring at a son that she just can't touch.
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side, 
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all, 
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,
Another body laying cold in the gutter.
Listen to me.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation, 
But he just can't see.
She give him loving that his body can't handle, 
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me.""
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror, 
But he doesn't recognize his own face.
His health is fading and he doesn't know why.
Three letters took him to his final resting place.
Y'all don't hear me.

I seen rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.

Steven Kowalczyk,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

And left me hear behind, what happened to the time
We used to share? I thought you'd always be there
I can't get you off my mind

My heart's in pain but no one seems to care
I called you on the telephone, hoping you'd be there

Broken hearted, I'm left with a broken heart
You tore my whole life apart, I can't live without you
Broken hearted, I'm left with a broken heart
You tore my whole life apart, I can't live without you

Tell me what am I supposed to do?
My whole life has been just you
Now, it seems it's over
Tell me was I the one to blame

This is driving me insane
Now, that you got another lover
I can't believe this is happening to me
I can't let go my love for you, now, can't you see?

Broken hearted, I'm left with a broken heart
You tore my whole life apart, I can't live without you

When I opened my eyes
And there you were
You were more than a dream

I could reach out and touch you girl
That was long ago
There are some things
That I guess I'll never know

When you love someone
You gotta learn to let them go

When I dream about you
That's when everything's alright
You're in my arms, here next to me, forever
When I dream about you, girl you never go away
Just close my eyes, wait for my dreams
'Cause I still love loving you.

How can I get you to see
That I'm falling apart
Since you've been gone
I can never be sure
I could ever let go

Stevie B,"My love
When I think I think of all the
Good times that we shared
Many places, many promises we had
And now it seems it's over and I know
Feeling that you're never coming home
And I'll be going on without you in my world

I know we never planned for love
To turn out quite this way
The way we started out that
One September day

The first time that I ever saw your face
My lonely heart was
Searching empty places
I miss your warm embrace
I need you here today

And this is my prayer for you

No matter how much you think it's over
And this I will swear to you
That I will be loving you forever
And I know you have to go on your own
To find your way back home

If my love had the power
To turn back the hands of tie
I would cherish
Every moment you were mine
And now it seems it's over and I know
I didn't know how much I loved you so
Now I'm so all alone without
You in my world

Today I though of you and me and
I began to pray
I prayed Allah would bring you back
To me someday
And you will stay forever in my heart
No matter where you are,
Now matter how far
I'll come running back to you
I'm so in love with you",Prayer
Stevie Brock,"Yeah
Love found me then
I found you

I woke up from my bed about 7 AM
It was Saturday but I couldn't sleep in
I was up all night
So many things on my mind
Learned a lesson about love 
Learned a lot about life
Didn't think I was ready
But you came my way
My first instinct was to run away
Never believed about love at first sight
When I took a second look I was frozen in time

No one told me love could sneak right up on you
Take over you like an arrow going through
I wasn't ready cupid hit me way too soon
Love found me then I found you
All I know is that you took me by surprise
Couldn't get away cause you caught my eye
I got you so I know I didn't lose
Love found me then I found you

See I was think bout what I like
Cause when it clicks right before my eyes
We could be together for the rest of our lives
Turn a magic time to an endless night
Love won't ever let us be alone again
Cause love came down heaven sent
To let you slip on by just wouldn't be right
Couldn't let you go even if I tried

No one told me love could sneak right up on you
Take over you like an arrow going through (through going through)
I wasn't ready cupid hit me way too soon
Love found me then I found you
All I know is that you took me by surprise
Couldn't get away cause you caught my eye
I got you so I know I didn't lose
Love found me then I found you

No one told me love could sneak right up on you (yeah yeah)
Take over you like an arrow going through
I wasn't ready cupid hit me way too soon
Love found me then I found you (then I found you)
All I know is that you took me by surprise
Couldn't get away cause you caught my eye
I got you so I know I didn't lose
Love found me then I found you

Girl you came along and rescued me
I was thinking love could only happen in a dream
Now I know it's real I feel it deep in me
When I look into your eyes
I'm hypnotized
The search is over and forever has begun
I know in my heart that you're the one I want
Destiny led me right into your arms
And from that day to this day
I love you even more

No one told me love could sneak right up on you
Take over you like an arrow going through
I wasn't ready cupid hit me way too soon

Stevie Hoang,"Since you went away
(it's been) one year two months
But it just dun seem like yesterday (we were) we were still together
Time has passed and things have changed so
Why do I feel this way
'cause you're with somebody else
And I'm with somebody else but

Whenever I think about the love we had
It hurts so bad
Whenever I think about the love we made
I said that I'd be strong
Girl I really thought that I'd move on
But still I find myself asking

Do you still think of me like I think about you
Do you still dream of me 'cause I can't sleep without you
Tell me if time should make a change
Then why do I feel the same
Your love has got me addicted
Said I don't know
When I'm with a chick and hittin it girl I call your name
Said I don't know
When I be with somebody else I push them away
Tell me if time should make a change
Then why do I feel the same
I know I gotta move on but I'm so addicted to you

It's been long enough don't know why I'm still holding on
If I had a wish babe I would turn back the hands of time
'cause you don't know what you got until it's gone (till it's gone)
It's the reason why I'm writing you this song
Girl I'm slippin and I don't know what to do
Girl I admit it, I'm sick over you
Damn I realised my mistake, my pride got in the way
I should have begged you to stay

Do you still think of me like I think about you
Do you still dream of me 'cause I can't sleep without you
Tell me if time should make a change
Then why do I feel the same
Your love has got me addicted
Said I don't know
When I'm with a chick and hittin it girl I call your name
Said I don't know
When I be with somebody else I push them away
Tell me if time should make a change
Then why do I feel the same
I know I gotta move on but I'm so addicted to you

If you ever lost someone you truly love
Let me hear you say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah, let me hear you say
And if you lost someone you truly need
Let me hear you say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)

Do you still think of me like I think about you
Do you still dream of me 'cause I can't sleep without you
Tell me if time should make a change

While the world lies in slumber

When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you

""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

That Sunny Skies hasn't a friend

Was it

One fallen leaf
Like the feather that it was
Was freedom by choice
Or baby was it love
Was it a thorn in your side
Something that you hide
Something you don't touch
Because it hurts too much
Oh

Well have you come to see
That my face is not seen
Oh outside my frost covered windows
Oh and just how deep
Do you hold that dream
In your hands each night this time
In your hands each night this time

Oh was it you
I heard calling which voice
Well I know that you are going
Which voice
Did I force you to remember
In the sacred name of love

To be brave save the stranger

You say you don't believe
Well could you just look at me
Look deep into my eyes my love
Well have you ever been in love
Have you touched the soul of someone
Did the fear inside you make you turn and run

I'll take off my cape for you
I'll take down my hair for you
Anything you want me to do my love
Well, I'll sit home and wait for you
Oh darling there's nothing that I'd rather do

She says to him why do you stay

I hate to see you
I hate to see you cry

Well, you can get her
But you can't keep her
And you can't catch her fall
She will call you
When she needs you
You know where she lives

She sits across the table the same glass table
Cries to her friend why am I so alone
He says, wo baby, baby, baby, baby
This is the path you have chosen
She probably goes under another name
Well, that's a good idea

So, you can get her
But you can't keep her
And you can't catch her fall
Well, she will call you

Stevie Nicks,"Thrown down through the arms of sleep
She fell through the ivory morning
Deep into the waters
Of the one she called love
She paled in the wake
Of what some call a dream
But, you cannot know a dream
Till you've known the nightmare

When I stood with you against the storm
And I tried once again
Well, I said, ""I'd like to leave you
With something warm""
How many times
Drowning in the sea
Drowning
That was when the dream took her prisoner
And she knew the dream was over
But, the nightmare was not over
Still some call that a dream
The nightmare... the nightmare

Well, you cannot know a dream
When you turn away
You don't know
You'll never care
The night is not your friend
And you have not had her
And when the nightmare ends
But, you never understand
When you're gone
She wakes up calling out
Oh, calling out
As children may cry as she will

Anytime, oh, anywhere
Blinded by the light of the day
She has known the nightmare

So about the moon and her sisters
How dare he take them prisoner
Well, if she had flung out her heart against him
Then in all of her wisdom
Oh, well that was a mystery

That was when the dream took her prisoner
And she knew the dream was over
But the nightmare was not over
Somewhere in her ancient ways
She walks through the night
And then she tries to get through the day
Some will never know
Or share any kind of dream

The nightmare
This is not the world
This is not the world
This is not the world
The nightmare
She wants him to fight, anytime, anywhere
She wants him to stand up
She wants him to win
This is not the world
This is not the world
This is not the real world

Well, I think you will like Sister Honey
She will help you
Make up your mind
Even if you don't need her
Tell her you need her
She needs you brother

Some kind of temptation
To know Sister
Never having allowed yourself
Do you understand the word, pleasure
Well, you say it's just never crossed your mind
And she believes you

Can we still be friends
The answer's always yes
Even best intentions turn around one day
Saying

Nobody's right, baby
All the time
And a fool never knows what he's leaving behind
So take some time to know the real story
Cause a soul that's true is your ride to glory
Don't let that golden hair get in your way , baby

Can we still be friends
The answer's always yes
Even best intentions turn around one day
Saying

Come back solemn stranger
It's your last chance
She's almost gone, now
And she'll go fast like a jet plane
And then fast like a star stream
She'll hit you with a fury
Whispering the words one more time, baby
One more time
And she says don't let that golden hair
Get in your way now",Sister Honey

It happened like a hurricane
I could never really tell you what this did to me
I could never make it better for you

Thing is
Time was
Part of me used to love you
Part of me still does
This light here
Some become strangers

Did it have to be so easy to live without it?
I was hoping to remember you with just a smile
Now the memory of giving you is giving out
Well, I could say that I knew it all the while

Didn't want to be the one to
Say goodbye
In a stranger's eyes
Look how we've changed

I don't really need this in my life
Why don't we forget about it?

Talk to me, talk to me
I can set your secrets free,baby

Though we lay face to face and cheek to cheek
Our voices stray from the common ground where they could meet
The walls run high, to veil a swelling tear
Oh,let the walls burn down,set your secrets free
You can break their bounds, cause you're safe with me
You can lose your doubt,cause you'll find no danger not here

I can see you running all the way back home

Like Alice through the Looking Glass 
She used to know who she was
Call out my name like Alice through the Looking Glass
But I get no answer she used to know who she was
And she prays for the world that she comes from

Each had their own charm 
Buried beneath a solid piece of armour or a steel plated vest
Some carry a stiletto in their garter along with everything else
That they carry oh, call my name 

Like Alice through the Looking Glass
She used to know who she was
Call out my name like Alice through the Looking Glass

In my way...disaster was the only thing that I could depend on...

And her eyes grew strangely bright
She turned around in her room 
What could she take and still survive the fire
But then again, there was a window
You know it's an illusion 
There is no fire burning just a soul crying

So cry for me take a little time and then stop
It's just something that you cannot see so stop
She swings around on the second story 
I'll get down she says
Well there is no fire burning just a soul crying

I will you know
So I take it to the limit
I will you know as I always have
I understand your position 
I withdraw my decision
Well I've got no more information for you

So still there is a fire that no one sees
She doesn't even see it either

And the ghost of the past that you live in

It's just the ghost of what you really want
And it's the ghost of the past that you live in
And it's the ghost of the future you are frightened of
So you look to your guardian angel

So long ago I was an innocent 
It had nothing to do with age
One day they were lovers one day they were friends
There was nothing else to say

Well just the ghost of what you want to be
And the ghost of the past that you live in
It's the ghost of the future that you're so frightened of
So you turn to your guardian angel

And a few of them were all that you really dreamed of
Love was the thing 
So the silver-haired girl looks for escapism

To feel the empty spaces she's feeling
She depends on her music like a husband
And she knows it's no good to fall in love again 
One day they were lovers one day they were friends
There was nothing else to say

It's just the ghost of the past of what you want to be
And the ghost of the past that you live in
Ghost of the future that you're so frightened of

Well, you're back out on the road again

And you try to tie together some connections 
You get some ribbons and some bows
And get back out on the road again

So you found a queen without a king
Oh yes, and everyone here loved her
No one was wrong

But you're a little bit like her
You're just a little bit like her
A little bit like her, a little bit like Juliet

Well, it's a heartless challenge
You pick your path and then you pray

You wake up in the mornin'
You see your sunrise, loves to go down
Lousy lovers, they pick their prey
But they never cry out loud, no, they don't cry out

Well, did she make you cry, make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love?
Is it over now ? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

Rock on, ancient queen, follow those who pale in your shadow
They say 'Rulers, they make bad lovers'
You better put your kingdom up for sale
Well you better sell it, sell it

Did she make you cry, make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love?
Is it over now? Do you know how?

Stevie Nicks,"Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover

All your life you've never seen
A woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven
Will you ever win

She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless

Would you stay if she promised you heaven
Will you ever win

There's something I've got to say to you tonight
It's time you took a look at me
Cause there's so much more to me
Than meets the eye

Well, there's more to love than makin' time
The harder you look the more you'll find
It's never easy no matter what they say

Love's a hard game to play
The heart's the price you pay
Love's a hard game to play
No matter what they say
Win or lose, no matter what they say
Love's a hard game to play

The problem here is not my fear
The trouble is you can't convince yourself
For tonight, let's lose the past
Make love last
Put our worries up on the shelf

We've been through thick and thin, and back again
And we can endure love's sweet pain
Remember, starting the fire is easy
The hardest part is learning how to keep the flame

Love's like walking a real fine line
You get too close and you'll go blind
Let go too long and it will all drift away

Just when I feel like I'm losin' you
I hear them voices call
They say it's better to have lost at love
Than never to have loved at all
Lose or win, stand or fall

Well, there's more to love than makin' time
The harder you look, the more you'll find

Stevie Nicks,"Well I've run through rainbows and castles of candy
I cried a river of tears from the pain
I try to dance with what life has to hand me
My partner's been pleasure, my partner's been pain

There are days when I swear I could fly like an eagle
And dark desperate hours that nobody sees
My arms stretched triumphant on top of the mountain
My head in my hands, down on my knees

Sometimes it's a bitch, sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes love's blind, and sometimes it sees
Sometimes it's roses, and, sometimes it's weeds
Sometimes it's a bitch, sometimes it's a breeze

I've reached in darkness and come out with treasure
I've laid down with love and I woke up with lies
What's it all worth only the heart can measure
It's not what's in the mirror, but what's left inside

Sometimes it's a bitch, sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes love's blind, and sometimes it sees
Sometimes it's roses, and, sometimes it's weeds
Sometimes it's a bitch, sometimes it's a breeze

You gotta take it as it comes
Sometimes it don't come easy

I've run through rainbows and castles of candy
And I've cried a river of tears from the pain
I tried to dance with what life had to hand me
And if I could, I'd do it all over again

Sometimes it's a bitch, sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes love's blind, and sometimes it sees
Sometimes it's roses, and, sometimes it's weeds
Sometimes it's a bitch, sometimes it's a breeze
Sometimes the picture just ain't what it seems

I pick up the phone you're on the other end
Sometimes to talk to you is all I need

And I understand it's not how we planned
But we'll make it
Just call me inspiration
I remember your voice at the station
You whispered to me at the station
Just call me inspiration

Your distant world has somehow pulled me in.

Maybe love will make it clear.
Oh, what words would keep you here?
Maybe love will reach your heart, thought I saw it in the dark.
Maybe love will change your mind, maybe this time.
 
A look, a touch just because I wanted them to mean so much.
You might not feel the same.
The day would end, but you'd go back to where you've been.
A kiss for luck, I wish you could have stayed.

You take me somewhere.
You show me your lifeline, reveal your other side.
I would say but the words won't come.
I'd just come undone.

I wonder what Greta would say 

Another lady another time 
Another heartbroken state of mind
Alone in her chambers she dreams of her home
Outside she's got a movie star view
Outcries well where will the kings go 
Where will the kings go now
She's got her eyes wide open 
And she's ready to stare you down
She says in words unspoken she's from out of town
Well some cry well I really don't dance down
Stormy weather it cuts like a knife

She's got her bags packed 
And she's off to the valley where the
sun meets the sea
You understand that 
She wants to live by the ocean 
And no one is pleased
She gets a house in the mountains 
The next day the next day she leaves the station

Do you really want to change her 
Or is it your right

Ooh alone in her chambers she dreams of her home
In a very real way she's the purist art form

She doesn't have five minutes

But what's worse is this pain in here
I can't stay in here

That I just don't fit?

We rode on horses made of sticks
I wore black and she wore white

Bang bang she shot me down
Bang bang I hit the ground
Bang bang that awful sound
Bang bang my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
I grew up, I called her mine
She would always laugh and say

Bang bang I shot you down

Girl I've been cryin' ever since you left
My mama told me get a hold of yourself
And be cool, calm and keep yourself together
She said be cool, calm and keep yourself together, ha ha ha, ha

Sugar plum you're really gold
And it just don't help to cry
So I wiped my tears away the other day
And strung my handkerchief up to dry
Then I changed my style puttin' on a smile
And went out to face the world

But I still get that old yearnin'
Can't be cool when my heart is burnin'
I still get that old feelin'

I say mother dear see here, see here
Tell me now what shall I do
Can't have that girl and I love her true
She said when things give up be manly
Now to be cool, calm, and keep yourself together
That's what my mama said

Sugar pie you said goodbye
And I cried myself to sleep
That's when my mother said don't lose your head son
It just don't help to weep
Now I'm the great pretender
I don't surrender to what I feel inside
I'm the life of the crowd, and ha, I left my blood
But it's all a fake disguise
'Cause I still hear my heart poundin'
Hard to be cool when you come around me
I still feel my heart purrin'
Hard to be calm when my insides stirrin'

I say mother dear see here, see here
Tell me now which way to go
Can't have that girl and I love her so

See how nice Mickey Mouse sleeps now?

Sled, and a big bag of toys, and he'll come to your house this year, too.
But sometimes, just sometimes, he doesn't have enough time 
To see every little boy and girl, because the world is so big.
So maybe we should sing a song for all the children that Santa didn't visit.

Bless the child who has no tin soldier;
No brass drummer boy to put to bed.

A shepherd who believed
That peace could come to any man
Made a promise to a star above
The day that love began.

""I will give to Him my lamb,
A shepherd's all I am.""
And so he walked the lonely sand
To find the place his heart was dreaming of
The day that love began.

Over meadows, over mountains
They came from valleys and from streams.
Every poet and every king
And one little shepherd with a dream.

But as the shepherd knelt to pray
His lamb just ran away
And teardrops filled his empty hand.
He broke his promise to a star above
The day that love began.

Then the smiling face of Mary
Beckoned the shepherd to her side
""Today you gave Him the best gift of all
The moment that you cried.""

When the two of us are far apart,
And one of us has a brok, en heart.

Now and then I call your name,
And suddenly your face appears,
But it's just a crazy game, when it ends, it ends in tears.

Darling, have a heart, don't let one mistake keep us apart.
I'm not meant to live alone, turn this house into a home.
When I climb the stair and turn the key,
Oh, please be there, still in love with me.",A House Is Not a Home
Stevie Wonder,"They say, Ruby you're like a  dream
Not always what you seem
And though my heart may break when I awake
Let it be so
I only know, Ruby, it's you
 
They say, Ruby you're like a song
You don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heart aches for me
But from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you
I hear your voice and I must come to you
I have no choice what else can I do? 
 
They say, Ruby you're like a flame
Into my life you came 
And though I should beware
Still I don't care you thrill me so

But you pass by me and pretend that you don't even see me.
But I want you to know: 
If one day you decide to smile and say hello, and I say goodbye;
Don't wonder why, my baby.  (No.)  Don't wonder why, my baby.

When I think of how you hurt me, it brings the tears to my eyes.
I just can't seem to make you happy no matter how hard I try.
I wonder why?
Seems like no matter what I do, it's never good enough for you.
My pain - it shows loud, but it still can't let go now, but I want you to know,
Now: nights grow old, and winds blow cold, so old if my loves grows cold,
And I don't wonder why, my baby.  (Woooo,) baby, don't wonder why.
Oh yeah!

(Yeah,) seems like no matter what I do, I'm never, never, never, never, 
Never, good enough for you.
My pain - it shows loud; oh, you know I still, just no matter, I just can't let go,
Now, but I want you to know:
Love me, baby.
Nights grow old, and winds blow cold, and so old if my love grows cold,
And I've... don't wonder why, baby.
No, no, no, no, don't wonder why, my baby.
Baby, don't wonder why; don't wonder why, my baby.
Don't wonder why, my baby.
No, no, no, no, don't wonder why, my baby. (Ooohhh.)
Don't wonder why, my baby.
Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?",Don't Wonder Why
Stevie Wonder,"[Chorus]
I can't let my heaven walk away;
Just can't let my heaven walk away.
Just gotta find a way to make her stay.
I don't know what I've done wrong.
Look up and find my heaven gone.

Called her name, but I called in vain.
I know she can't answer from a picture frame.
Only an hour ago, I held her in real flesh and blood.
She just grabbed her coat and said: ""please, I've had enough.""
She kept me well like a Sunday prayer.
Just like my own right hand, the girl was always there.
To every man but me, her eyes were blind.
I was in the promised land long before my time.

[Chorus]

I accused my baby of being a liar.
I said the flesh is weak in God's key trial.
I only asked her to hear her tell me no,
But my question back-fired; I didn't expect her to go.

[Chorus x 2]",I Can't Let My Heaven Walk Away
Stevie Wonder,"You can bet you're sweeter than ever,
And your love is making it better.
I can feel it in my bones,
Oh, each time we're alone,
Cause I live in ecstasy,
And my soul refuses sleep,
Cause joy, joy, takes over me.
Through thick and thin I'll stand,
Loving you always.
Yes, I need you, mama,
To take the heartache away.
I know the sun's gon' shine,
And as long as you're mine:
It's joy, joy, joy, I feel inside.
Your love's potion
Gives me the notion
To shout out loud.
Oh, baby, baby, baby, babe.
Like a spinning top,
I can't stop,
Just loving you.
You know Stevie loves you;
Needs you, baby, oh yeah.
You know my love is sure to live;
Ain't goin' nowhere.
And I do believe, girl,
You were meant for me,
Cause I live in ecstasy,
And my soul refuses sleep,
Cause joy, joy, takes over me.
Oh, baby, joy,
Joy, joy, joy, joy,
Joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy...

Takes over me.

The way you need me;

You have me, and I have you.

Well, there is something that I think you ought to know.
There are people who will say our love won't grow, oh no;
It's important that you face them with a smile, girl,
And you tell them.
Honey, maybe someday lovin' just might be worth while,
Whoa, yeah.
Well, there is something that I'd like to say,
And there is something that we can do today,
And there is one thing that I know has come our way.
Oh baby,
They can't hurt us though I know they'll try,
And it will work out,
But they won't know why.

Hey, I practice looking bored so you can feel ignored,
But that don't mean that I'm not really caring.
Yeah, 'cause you can't judge a book by it's cover,
And you can't judge a book by it's lover.
Maybe my coldness is a mask; maybe your loving will last,
But can't judge a book by it's cover.

Somewhere beyond the skin; somewhere deep within,
We may find that love is there to test us, yeah,
But we've got to have the nerve to give it all it deserves,
And maybe we'll find something precious.
Yeah, 'cause you can't judge a book by it's cover.
Only time it's gonna show; only time will let us know.
Cause you can't judge a book by it's cover,
And you can't judge a book by it's lover.
We've got to search each other's minds.
We've got to read between the lines.

On the road to my horizon

And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'

Stevie Wonder,"Lady love and lady cared
But lady went away
And left me all alone to suffer

And now I feel it's not fair
For me to fall in love
The truth is the real me you must uncover

Seems so long, since I've heard the sound
It's been so long, since I've trusted in someone else
Had to see it all for myself
It's been so long, that the world seems cold
But I think it's time in my life to find myself again

Lady loved and lady stayed
Until she was too pleased
She knew I wouldn't leave for her to suffer
I'd never make her suffer

I believe you're just like me
In that you understand
You want me for your man to always love me

You can believe it's seems so long, since I've touched a wanting hand
Oh, it seems so long, since I've trusted in someone else
Had to see this world for myself
And it's been so long that the world seems cold
Now I think I've found someone to make me trust in someone again

I believe that I can trust in you",Seems So Long

Stevie Wonder,"Your name is big brother
You say that you're watching me on the tele,
Seeing me go nowhere,
Your name is big brother,
You say that you're tired of me protesting,
Children dying everyday,
My name is nobody
But I can't wait to see your face inside my door ooh

Your name is big brother
You say that you got me all in your notebook,
Writing it down everyday,
Your name is I'll see ya,
I'll change if you vote me in as a pres,

Da da da da da, do do do, do do
Do do do do do do, do do

I live in the ghetto,
Someday I will move on my feet to the other side,

My name is secluded, we live in a house the size of a matchbox,
Roaches live with us, wall to wall

You've killed all our leaders,
I don't even have to do nothin' to you,
You'll cause your own country to fall",Big Brother
Stevie Wonder,"Where has my love gone?
How can I go on?
It seems dear love has gone away

Where is my spirit?
I'm nowhere near it
Oh yes, my love has gone astray

But I'll blame it on the sun
The sun that didn't shine
I'll blame it on the wind and the trees

I'll blame it on the time that never was enough
I'll blame it on the tide and the sea
But, my heart blames it on me

Who poured the love out?
What made this bitter doubt?
Is peace not here for me to see?

Wish I could tell you
What I am feeling
But words won't come for me to speak

Oh, but I'll blame it on the sun
That didn't fill the sky
I'll blame it on the birds and the trees

I'll blame it on the day that ended once too soon
I'll blame it on the nights that could not be
But, my heart blames it on me

Yeh, yeh, yeh, ooh
Your heart blames it on you this time",Blame It on the Sun
Stevie Wonder,"Never tears or sorrows came before me in my mind
I had no problems, never a problem in my life
Never a worry on my mind
All my days before today were happy

And secure until your phone call
You were tellin' me goodbye
Now I'm lookin' for another love
I'm lookin' for another pure love in my life

Oh
And I'm lookin' for another love
I'm lookin' for another pure love in my life
Now the wheel of fate has turned
I'm worried 'bout the new love you've discovered

He is a problem in my life
I have a problem on my mind
Things you cherish most in your life
Can be taken if they're left neglected

Leavin' a problem in your life
'Cause now I'm lookin' for another love
I'm lookin' for another pure love in my life, ooh

And now I'm lookin' for another love
I'm lookin' for another pure love in my life, ooh

Stevie Wonder,"I'm feelin' down and some kind of lonely,
'Cause' my baby done left me here,
Heart is blazing like a five alarm fire
And I don't even give a care

I feel like the world is turnin' on me,
My dreams turn to ashes right in front of my face,
And I'm gettin' kind of worried,
And I feel so out of place,
Maybe your baby done made some other plans, ooh
Maybe your baby done made some other plans

I feel like cryin', yeh, yeh
Maybe baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

In the mornin' when I've got heartache,
I can't call up the doctor for help,
'Cause the only person that could ever do me any good,
Is steppin' out with my best friend

I feel like I'm slippin' deeper,
Slippin' deeper into myself,
And I, I can't take it,
This stuff is scarin' me to death, I

Maybe your baby done made some other plans,
Kinda makin' me worried,
Maybe your baby done made some other plans

Little Sally Walker, sittin' in a saucer,
Checkin' out the guys that are passing by

By, by, by, by, by
Maybe your baby done made some other plans

Maybe your baby done made some other plans,
Not includin' future plans,
Maybe your baby done made some other plans,
Maybe your baby done made some other plans,
Maybe your baby done made another plan

Stevie Wonder,"Tuesday heartbreak seem to be unfair,
'Cause you say that you found another man,
Tuesday break heart, guess you just don't care,
'Cause you found you another man

I want to be with you when you're all alone,
I want to be with you when you feel you got, got another man,
You see oh, baby, all alright

I want to be with you when the night time comes,
I want to be with you when the daytime comes,
I want to stay, oh baby, lemme, baby with you

Tuesday heartbreak seem to be a drag,
When you know that you love her especially,
Catch up baby, catch up with my dreams,
Maybe then I could see you all the time

But I want to be with you till the night time comes,
I want to be with you till daytime comes,
I want to stay and never go away,
Oh baby, it's alright

I want to be with you till night time comes,
I want to stay with you till the morning runs,
I want to, baby, baby, baby, baby oh baby it's alright

I want to be with you till night time comes,
I want to be with you till the daytime comes,
I wanna stay, oh baby, get away, it's alright
I want to be with you till daytime comes",Tuesday Heartbreak
Stevie Wonder,"When you believe in a feeling,
It's holding you back from my love,
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

When you insist on excluding
The tenderness that's in my kiss,
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

If you try to display an emotion,
That will contradict itself,
You will find your heart just sitting
Like a statue on a shelf, on a shelf, on a shelf

Should you depend on an outlet,
Through which an escape can be found,
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

If you don't see there's no way out,
Just no way of getting around me,
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

Yes, you know the plans I am making,
Are intended to capture you,
So you practice false reactions,
To delay the things I do, the things I do,
Things I do, foolish you, hey

You've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl, mmm mmm yeah yeh
You've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

There's no reward in detouring
My deep sincerity
Especially since what you're feeling,
Is perfectly clear to me, clear to me, clear to me

Before you discover the feeling,
You've tried very hard to hide,
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

But when you can find just a small space,
To let my love live in your mind,
Then you'll have it good girl, you'll have it good girl
You'll have it good girl,
You'll have it good, you'll have it good, you'll have it good, you'll have it good girl
You'll have it good girl, have
Have it good, have it good, you'll have it good, you'll have it good, baby baby",You've Got It Bad Girl
