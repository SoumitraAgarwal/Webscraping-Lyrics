Fair Warning,"I see you smile - such a silent smile
A bittersweet emotion -
From deep inside your eyes

And sometimes in the night -
As you whisper in your sleep
You reach out like you used to
And then it cuts so deep

For the love that I am sending -
Now it's drifting with the wind
And the faith I'm still pretending -
It's a fight my heart can't win

Just tell me I'm wrong -
Just tell me this love ain't gonna die
Just tell me I'm wrong -
Whatever you need I'll make it right
Just don't keep me hanging on, girl -
To a dream your heart can't find
Don't you know - it's breaking mine

I roam the streets -
Trying to read your mind
A drifter going nowhere -
For now these eyes are blind

But somewhere in that night -
There's a dream that drives me on
No matter what it takes now -
'Cause still it seems so strong

But the love that I am sending -
Now it's drifting with the wind
And the doubts they're never ending -
It's a fight my heart can't win

Just tell me I'm wrong -
Just tell me this love ain't gonna die
Just tell me I'm wrong -
Whatever it takes I'm gonna try
Just don't keep me hanging on, girl -
To a dream your heart can't find
Don't you know - it's breaking mine

Just tell me I'm wrong -
Just tell me this love ain't gonna die
Just tell me I'm wrong -
Whatever you need I'll make it right
Just don't keep me hanging on, girl -
To a dream your heart can't find
Don't you know - it's breaking mine




",Tell Me I'm Wrong
Fair Warning,"As the night's coming slowly -
In endless space and time
I can feel through the silence -
There's something out of line
There's a force in the distance -
That pulls me on too strong
To a hole in the system -
I can't resist for long

Through the oceans - of the night
Distant starlight - shining bright
Lost in silence - my fuel's down -
Getting low
I can't get on - I can't get back -
There's just one way to go

Through the fire - through the fire -
Through the fire - through the fire -

In the heart of the moment -
I feel my heartbeat rise
As a stargate to heaven -
Unfolds before my eyes
There's a light in the distance -
I now I can't be late
If you just could excuse me -
I must be on my way

Through the oceans - of the night
Distant starlight - shining bright
Out from nowhere - a thunder -
Blinding blow
I can't get on - I can't get back -
There's just one way to go

Through the fire - through the fire -
Take me higher - through the fire -

Through the fire - through the fire...

Fair Warning,"Dreamin' of the summer wind
Talking to the night
Silence left me over on my own

The memories of you and me
They keep me warm inside
For days are getting shorter now
And colder since you're gone.

And somewhere in that night, I see you cry
I wish, I could have wiped away, the pain you felt inside

All of my love to you
All of my hope and my faith in this life
May all of your dreams come true
Forever you shall stay in this heart of mine

Summer came and summer went
't was love on borrowed time
It feels like an illusion long bygone

And still I wonder, why we lost our way
I wish, I just could hold you now, I wish you would have stayed

All of my love to you
All of my hope and my faith in this life
May all of your dreams come true
Forever you shall stay in this heart of mine

All of my love to you
All of my hope and my faith in this life
May all of your dreams come true
Forever you shall stay in this heart of mine",All Of My Love
Fair Warning,"Girl, I've been lonely
I've been lost in the shadows
I found my way a thousand times

But this time it's different
?Cause my heart's been so empty
There's desperation on my mind

I sailed the ocean ? now my ships wrecked at the shore
The stars I followed ? I can't see them anymore

Angel of the dawn ? night is coming on
Won?t you heal me, save my soul
Open up my heart ? take me through the dark
?Cause tonight, I cry ? for my soul

You know, I've been loving

I've been hurting and healing
The ways of life ? I've seen a few

But time is a teacher
And I fear that I'm changing
Now I'm just longing to be true

The road I travelled ? now it?s washed into the sea
The tide is rising ? won?t you come and set me free>

Angel of the dawn ? night is coming on
Won?t you heal me, save my soul
Open up my heart ? take me through the dark
?Cause tonight, I cry ? for my soul",Angel of Dawn
Fair Warning,"So here you go again, all on your own
The roads you used to know
Turned into deserted land
Lost in your memories
A place called home
It's now you realize
All your hope was build on sand

When life's got you down
Then life can bring you rught up
Cause no one can steal your dreams

Don't give up
Whatever may come
There still shines a light
Keep your dreams
When the walls come tumbling down
Just stand up and fight

Sure there've been better days
For you and me
But you've made up your mind
To walk alone on lonely streets
Though sadness fills my heart
Since you've been gone
May all your dreams come true
May you trust the ones you meet

When life's got you down
Then life can bring you right up
'Cause no one can steel your dreams

Don't give up
Whatever may come
There still shines a light
Keep your dreams
When the walls come tumbling down
Just stand up and fight

When life's got you down
Then life can bring you right up
'Cause no one can steal your dreams

No one can steal your dreams
I said no one can steal your dreams
Oh ...no...
Keep them
You have to keep them
Cause there still shines a light
So stand up and fight
And fight, and fight
So don't give up
Never give up
So don't give up

Don't give up
Never give up
Don't give up

Keep your dreams

I resisted and I can be stubborn

Days turned to years and went by

Fairground Attraction,"Jazz in a basement bar, the moon's on the rain 
Drunk too much, spent too much, penniless again 
Oh sweetheart where are you tonight 
I remember when we used to walk by the Thames 
The lights on the embankment like jewels on chains 
I'll never forget what you said at the start 
You said â??I'll put a string of lights 'round your heartâ?? 
 
I've got your photograph, the one that you signed 
Tucked in my pocket, all tattered by time 
Oh sweetheart who's with you tonight 
Are you there at the roundabouts, down in the park 
Where you sneak through the railings, when it's locked after dark 
Is she learning the song you taught me at the start 
The one the bells and the banjos played on our hearts 
 
Now the bars are all empty, everybody's gone home 
Perhaps I'll walk down the embankment alone 
Oh sweetheart I'm glad that we met 
And that there's jazz in the basement bars 
And jewels on chains

And spent too much 
But there's moon on the rain",Moon on the Rain

Just stepped out into the world
White cotton summer dresses, hair tied in lace

In her China dream house, with confetti in his pocket
And ice in his heart he tore that little girl's world apart

With some worn out line from a film that you saw
No don't waste your time and your trouble you'll see

And she's known witchcraft on nights like this

Like when Aunt Mary took her to O'Riley's caff

So don't go coming back
So she took to painting pictures 
Such a promising child 
But sometimes the pictures she paints 
Are ugly and wild 
She doesn't exactly understand 
But it's something to do with the war 
 
So she prays to the statues on Sundays

Young men kill tin ducks in sharp shooter poses
The laughter of the lovers on the rickety stairs
The rumble of the diesel and the sounds of the fair

Took my hands in hers and told me their secrets
“Your heart is a fire and his love is an ember
You must forget what you’ll always remember”

With uniforms round him, the hound and the fox can be seen
A willow tree leaving its branches to ground
Is breathing in time to a bell's hollow sound

Dream, dream
Dream, dream
Nature, their numbers have swelled

The sun in the east is the lord of the feast to be held
The doomed and the dutiful tread on the dew
With frost on their faces and shine on their shoes

Dream, dream
Looking to earth and to sky
John stares at John walking slowly along with a sigh
The hand of a stranger takes hold of his arm
A voice in his ear says ""They'll do you no harm""

Be kind to yourself when you're tired of yourself
Don't go mixing the reds along with the blues

The reins to his hands they are tied

Learn to slow down and drift with the tide

One morning in the month of June,
While feather'd warbling songsters
Their charming notes did sweetly tune,
I overheard a lady

Lamenting in sad grief and woe,
And talking with young Bonaparte
Concerning the bonny Bunch of Roses, O.

Thus spake the young Napoleon,
And grasp'd his mother by the hand:-
""Oh, mother dear have patience,
Till I am able to command

I'll raise a numerous army,
And through tremendous dangers go,
And in spite of all the universe,
I'll gain the bonny Bunch of Roses, O.""

Oh, son, speak not so venturesome
For England is the heart of oak
Of England, Scotland, and Ireland,
The unity can ne'er be broke.
And think you on your father

In the Island where he now lies low,
He is not yet interred in France,
So beware of the bonny Bunch of Roses, O.

Your father raised great armies,
And likewise kings did join the throng,
He was so well provided.
Enough to sweep the world along.

But when he went to Moscow,
He was o'erpower'd by drifting snow,
And though Moscow was blazing
He lost the bonny Bunch of Roses, O.

""Oh, mother, adieu for ever,
I am now on my dying bed,
If I had liv'd I'd have been brave
But now I droop my youthful head.

And when our bones do moulder,
And weeping-willows o'er us grow,
Its deeds to bold Napoleon
Will stain the bonny Bunch of Roses, O.""",The Bonny Bunch of Roses

And the moon rose over the field

She was safely gathered in my arms when from the barn
Drifted the sound of a violin and we hurried back to the farm,
And all were dancing in the lantern light and music filled the air,
And I thanked my stars for the harvest moon and the girl from the hiring fair

Fairport Convention,"There were three men come out of the west, their fortunes for to try
And these three men made a solemn vow, John Barleycorn would die
They've ploughed, they've sown, they've harrowed, thrown clods upon his head
Till these three men were satisfied John Barleycorn was dead

There's beer all in the barrel and brandy in the glass
But little Sir John, with his nut-brown bowl, proved the strongest man at last

They've let him lie for a long long time till the rains from heaven did fall
And little Sir John sprang up his head and so amazed them all
They've let him stand till midsummer's day and he looks both pale and wan
Then little Sir John's grown a long long beard and so become a man

There's beer all in the barrel and brandy in the glass
But little Sir John, with his nut-brown bowl, proved the strongest man at last
There's beer all in the barrel and brandy in the glass
But little Sir John, with his nut-brown bowl, proved the strongest man at last

They've hired men with the sharp-edged scythes to cut him off at the knee
They've rolled him and tied him around the waist, treated him most barbarously
They've hired men with the sharp-edged forks to prick him to the heart
And the loader has served him worse than that for he's bound him to the cart
So they've wheeled him around and around the field till they've come unto a barn
And here they've kept their solemn word concerning Barleycorn
They've hired men with the crab tree sticks to split him skin from bone
And the miller has served him worse than that for he's ground him between two stones

There's beer all in the barrel and brandy in the glass
But little Sir John, with his nut-brown bowl, proved the strongest man at last

Fairport Convention,"A holiday, a holiday, and the first one of the year 
Lord Donald's wife came into the church, the gospel for to hear 
And when the meeting it was done, she cast her eyes about 
And there she saw little Matty Groves, walking in the crowd 
""Come home with me, little Matty Groves, come home with me tonight 
Come home with me, little Matty Groves, and sleep with me till light"" 
""Oh, I can't come home, I won't come home and sleep with you tonight 
By the rings on your fingers I can tell you are my master's wife"" 
""But if I am Lord Donald's wife, Lord Donald's not at home 
He is out in the far cornfields bringing the yearlings home"" 

And a servant who was standing by and hearing what was said 
He swore Lord Donald he would know before the sun would set 
And in his hurry to carry the news, he bent his breast and ran 
And when he came to the broad millstream, he took off his shoes and he swam 

Little Matty Groves, he lay down and took a little sleep 
When he awoke, Lord Donald was standing at his feet 
Saying ""How do you like my feather bed and how do you like my sheets 
How do you like my lady who lies in your arms asleep?"" 
""Oh, well I like your feather bed and well I like your sheets 
But better I like your lady gay who lies in my arms asleep"" 
""Well, get up, get up,"" Lord Donald cried, ""get up as quick as you can 
It'll never be said in fair England that I slew a naked man"" 
""Oh, I can't get up, I won't get up, I can't get up for my life 
For you have two long beaten swords and I not a pocket knife"" 
""Well it's true I have two beaten swords and they cost me deep in the purse 
But you will have the better of them and I will have the worse 
And you will strike the very first blow and strike it like a man 
I will strike the very next blow and I'll kill you if I can"" 

So Matty struck the very first blow and he hurt Lord Donald sore 
Lord Donald struck the very next blow and Matty struck no more 
And then Lord Donald took his wife and he sat her on his knee 
Saying ""Who do you like the best of us, Matty Groves or me?"" 
And then up spoke his own dear wife, never heard to speak so free 
""I'd rather a kiss from dead Matty's lips than you or your finery"" 

Lord Donald he jumped up and loudly he did bawl 
He struck his wife right through the heart and pinned her against the wall 
""A grave, a grave,"" Lord Donald cried, ""to put these lovers in 
But bury my lady at the top for she was of noble kin""",Matty Groves

Fairport Convention,"Red and gold are royal colors
Peasant colours are green and brown
Green is the corn in the brown earth when it's growing
Red and gold when the harvest is cut down.

Through Cropredy in Oxfordshire the Cherwell takes its course
And the willows weep into its waters clear
My name it is Will Tims and it's here that I was born
And raised in faith my King and God to fear.

In 1644 the King in Oxford Town did dwell
Though we'd heard that Cromwell's army was nearby
It did not occur to me that little Cropredy
Could be witness to the meeting of both sides

On June the 29th that year I was about my work
Cutting hedges in the meadow by the stream
My blade slipped, I cut my hand and my own dear blood did flow
Upon the brown earth and the corn still green

Now it did distress me so to watch my own blood flow
And quickly soak into the greedy ground
In red and gold my colors swam and sweat broke on my brow
And faint I knew that I must lay me down

At first I thought the thundering was just inside my head
So I raised myself above the hedge to see
And I watched as in a dream as the armies fought downstream
The battle for the bridge at Cropredy

Now the King's men fought in red and gold though
Cromwell's men were plainer
The blood they spilled was coloured just the same
Through the hedgerow's fragile cover I saw brother killing brother
And all of this was done in Jesus' name

All that day and all the next the battle it was raging
Though when darkness came I slipped away
But the crying of the dying kept me wakeful and just lying
In my bed until the dawning of the day

And the dreams I had were red and gold
And the little stream became a flood
From all my brothers killing one another
Till waking I realised it was all my own dear blood

Some were buried in the church and some just where they fell
With no markers to declare their place of rest
But the poppies they do grow where they were never sown
And to my mind they do declare it best

And each year when the green corn once again turns into gold
And the poppies in the field again remind me
Like the scar upon my hand and the blood spilled on this land
And the hungry earth so eager to confine me

For read and gold they are the colours
One is blood and one is power
Though I may find my rest in Cropredy Church
In golden fields forever will spring the poppy flower

By Cropredy the Cherwell is still bidden to keep flowing
And the willows by its side still gently weep
But still in restless dreams by this most peaceful stream
The poppies wake me from my rightful sleep

And the dreams I have are red and gold
And the little stream becomes a flood
From all my brothers killing one another
Till waking I realise it's all my own dear blood",Red and Gold

**This song is Bob Dylan's 'If You Gotta Go, Go Now'. Here's the original:

 Listen to me, baby,
 There's something you must see.
 I want to be with you, gal,
 If you want to be with me.
 
 But if you got to go,
 It's all right.
 But if you got to go, go now,
 Or else you gotta stay all night.
 
 It ain't that I'm questionin' you.
 To take part in any quiz.
 It's just that I ain't got no watch
 An' you keep askin' me what time it is.
 
 But if you got to go,
 It's all right.
 But if you got to go, go now,
 Or else you gotta stay all night.
 
 I am just a poor boy, baby,
 Lookin' to connect.
 But I certainly don't want you thinkin'
 That I ain't got any respect.
 
 But if you got to go,
 It's all right.
 But if you got to go, go now,
 Or else you gotta stay all night.
 
 You know I'd have nightmares
 And a guilty conscience, too,
 If I kept you from anything
 That you really wanted to do.
 
 But if you got to go,
 It's all right.
 But if you got to go, go now,
 Or else you gotta stay all night.
 
 It ain't that I'm wantin'
 Anything you never gave before.
 It's just that I'll be sleepin' soon,
 It'll be too dark for you to find the door.
 
 But if you got to go,
 It's all right.
 But if you got to go, go now,
 Or else you gotta stay all night.",Si Tu Dois Partir

To travel to Carter Hall for young Tam Lin is there 

None that go by Carter Hall but they leave him a pledge 
Either their mantles of green or else their maidenhead"" 

Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee 
And she's gone to Carter Hall as fast as go can she 

She'd not pulled a double rose, a rose but only two 
When up there came young Tam Lin says ""Lady, pull no more"" 

""And why come you to Carter Hall without command from me?"" 
""I'll come and go"", young Janet said, ""and ask no leave of thee"" 

Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee 
And she's gone to her father as fast as go can she 

Well, up then spoke her father dear and he spoke meek and mild 
""Oh, and alas, Janet,"" he said, ""I think you go with child"" 

""Well, if that be so,"" Janet said, ""myself shall bear the blame 
There's not a knight in all your hall shall get the baby's name 

For if my love were an earthly knight as he is an elfin grey 
I'd not change my own true love for any knight you have"" 

Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee 
And she's gone to Carter Hall as fast as go can she 

""Oh, tell to me, Tam Lin,"" she said, ""why came you here to dwell?""

And at the end of seven years she pays a tithe to hell

Those that would their true love win at Miles Cross they must buy 

So first let past the horses black and then let past the brown 
Quickly run to the white steed and pull the rider down 

For I'll ride on the white steed, the nearest to the town 
For I was an earthly knight, they give me that renown 

Oh, they will turn me in your arms to a newt or a snake 
But hold me tight and fear not, I am your baby's father 

And they will turn me in your arms into a lion bold 
But hold me tight and fear not and you will love your child 

And they will turn me in your arms into a naked knight 
But cloak me in your mantle and keep me out of sight"" 

In the middle of the night she heard the bridle ring 
She heeded what he did say and young Tam Lin did win 

Then up spoke the Faery Queen, an angry queen was she 
Woe betide her ?ill-fought? face, an ill death may she die

I have looked him in the eyes and turned him to a tree""",Tam Lin

Primroses pale on a velvet green hue,
Warm summer days by cool waterfalls,
Like the music we hear,
Those things we'll always hold dear,
Like an old fashioned waltz.
When the moonlight shines down
On the Hollywood world,
And the heroine waits 
For her beau to return,
And violins play 
From behind garden walls,
How I'd love to remain 
With the silver refrain
Of an old fashioned waltz.

As they dance round the floor,
And there's no-one else there,
And the world is no more 
And there's never a care,
By the perfect lagoon 
Where the nightingale calls,
With only the moon 
And the nostalgic tune
Of an old fashioned waltz.

Roses are red and violets are blue,
Primroses pale on a velvet green hue,
Warm summer days by cool waterfalls,
Like the music we hear,

Whe people talk of your success in city life
But I could never tell if she heard them talk as well

But now I always hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go

There's ways you know to turn her pretty head
Well its all that I can do when me' working day is through
To let her heart beat me to sleep each night in bed

She's like the river that never runs dry.
She's like the sunshine on the lee shore,
I love my love and love is no more.

'Twas down in the meadow this fair maid bent
A-picking the primrose just as she went.
The more she picked and the more she pulled,
Until she gathered her apron full.

She climbed on yonder hill above
To give a rose unto her love.
She gave him one, she gave him three
She gave her heart for company.

And as they sat on yonder hill
His heart grew hard, so harder still.
He has two hearts instead of one.

To think I love no one but thee.

In the middle of the night she heard the bridle ring 
She heeded what he did say and young Tam Lin did win 

Then up spoke the Faery Queen, an angry queen was she

I have looked him in the eyes and turned him to a tree""",Tamlin

Fairport Convention,"Across the evening sky, all the birds are leaving
But how can they know it's time for them to go?
Before the winter fire, I will still be dreaming
I have no thought of time
For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?
Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time
For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?
And I am not alone while my love is near me
I know it will be so until it's time to go
So come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again
I have no fear of time
For who knows how my love grows?
And who knows where the time goes?

Fairport Convention,"Calling all olive branches and laid off doves
There is work to do before we say goodbye
But who can see them turning to the face of love
Though I hear them pleading with me, don't let us die

As I sit I can see their troubled souls wander by
And I feel them leaning on my shoulder to cry
Oh, one more chance
Naked tree of winter seems to stand so proud

Lording the poor mortal as he goes
And the tears which well beneath his somber shroud
Will they fall with the shame of somebody who knows
He can never be like the thought of a rose

Whose beauty remains, even when the bloom goes
Oh, oh, one more chance
Or is it too late to change the ways we're bound to go

Is it too late, there's surely one of us must know
Is it too late to change the ways we're bound to go
Is it too late, there's surely one of us must know

Fairport Convention,"As gentle tides go rolling by,
Along the salt sea strand
The colours blend and roll as one
Together in the sand.
And often do the winds entwine
Do send their distant call,
The quiet joys of brotherhood,
And love is lord of all.

The oak and weed together rise,
Along the common ground.
The mare and stallion light and dark
Have thunder in their sound.
The rainbow sign, the blended flower
Still have my heart in thrall.
The quiet joys of brotherhood,
And love is lord of all.

But man has come to plough the tide,
The oak lies on the ground.
I hear their tires in the fields,
They drive the stallion down.
The roses bleed both light and dark,
The winds do seldom call.
The running sands recall the time
When love was lord of all.",Quiet Joys of Brotherhood
Fairport Convention,"Love is but a song we sing,
Hear a way we die.
You can make the mountains ring,
Hear the angels cry.
Tho' the dove is on the wing
You need not know why.

Hey, people now,
Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

Some will come and some will go,
We shall surely pass.
When the wind that left us here,
Returns for us at last.
We are but a moment's sunlight,
Fading on the grass.

Hey, people now,
Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

Men await their freedom call from a crimson tide
We've got a remote chance, we will try with all we've got

Fairyland,"My love I Hail you from a faraway place,
The words that I lay down are painful to write. And now I'm done,
I'll be leaving to a forsaken land... and my life will come to an end.

I've marched with my brothers for a long, long time, we carry the hope for those
Days to come. But still I long the embrace of the one I call mine
That's the only thing I'll miss when I die...

So far away from this place of mine, so long overdue is a kiss to my love
Feeling her skin under this roof of mine, I wish I had more time

I see the old days in the ripening fields, the joy to be with you and become as one
But now it's gone, though I'm sure we will meet again
In this world or the next

So far away from this place of mine, so long overdue is a kiss to my love
Feeling her skin under this roof of mine, I wish I had more time

To be with you, I'd give it all. To grow old with you, I'd give it all
Fate has decided otherwise, my sister of the Light

My love I Hail you from a faraway place.
""Remember by face""
Words that I lay down are painful to write.
""Don't fear, my love""
And now I'm done I'm entering a forsaken land...
""I will always be there""
My life will come to an end.

So far away from this place of mine, so long overdue is a kiss to my love
Feeling her skin under this roof of mine
I wish I had more time

Now as I stand on the battle field my hopes are all going to our only son
He shall be strong and never yield, he is what the future will bring...

That their time has just begun
I have suffered for my anger
There are wars that can't be won

Father father please believe me
I am laying down my guns
I am broken like an arrow
Forgive me
Forgive your wayward son

Everybody needs somebody to love
(mother, mother)
Everybody needs somebody to hate

Everybody's bitching
'cause they can't get enough
And it's hard to hold on
When there's no one to lean on

Lord you got to keep the faith
Faith: don't let your love turn to hate
Right now we got to
Keep the faith

Tell me baby when I hurt you
Do you keep it all inside
Do you tell me al's forgiven
And just hide behind your pride

Everybody needs somebody to love
(mother, father)
Everybody needs somebody to hate
(please don't leave me)
Everybody's bleeding
'cause the times are tough
Well it's hard to be strong
When there's no one to dream on

Of society's lies

Sometimes I wish that I was blind
Sometimes I wait forever

So no one sees me cryin'
Trying to wash away the pain

There's things I've done I can't erase
Every night we fall from grace

It's hard with the world in yours face

How come it hurts so babe 
Why does it feel so sad 

To fall in love was something that my heart was dreaming of 
And then there came the day when I found you 
And heaven came to earth and you were my angel 
I fell in love with you 
No one but you 

Suddenly I saw the change that came into your eyes 
I feel you were afraid to tell me why 
I thought the thing called love would be forever 
Thought our love was true 
And now the pain of losing you 

If you never know just what you mean 
You are my first love 
If you never know 
You're everything 
You are my first love 

Tell me how a thing that brings such joy can bring such pain 
And how could something so wrong seem so right 
We never had the chance to make it get better 
We never said goodbye, no 
I never wanna feel the pain of losing love again 
'Cause love just has a way of breaking down 
Next time I'm gonna pray that things will be better

To make you feel I'm down with

I love you
I want you
You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it any more

My heart just erased
All the guys I knew before
You walked into my life
I was the type to never want for nothing

That made it plain for me to see

And every mother's child is gonna spy

a shepherd who believed 
that peace could come to any man 
made a promise to the star above 
the day that love began 

i will give to him my lamb 
a shepherds all i am 
and so he walked the lonely sand 
to find the place his heart was dreaming of 
the day that love began 

over meadows over mountains 
they came from valleys and from streams 
every poet and every king 
and one little shepherd with a dream 

but as the shepherd knelt to pray 
his lamb just ran away 
and tear drops filled his empty hand 
he broke his promise to the star above 
the day that love began 

then the smiling face of mary 
beckoned the shepherd to her side 
today you gave him the best gift of all 
the moment that you cried 

once upon a christmas eve 
a shepherd who believed 
that peace could come to any man 
found the place his heart was dreaming of 
and he kept his promise to the star above

Giving the tree the trim
You’ll hear voices by starlight
Singing a Yuletide hymn

Very God begotten not created

Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation
Sing all ye, citizens of heaven above
Glory to God in the highest
O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord

See how the Shepard's summoned to his cradle
Leaving their flocks, draw nigh with lowly fear
We too will thither hend our joyful footsteps

No matter what I do 
Even if I try I, I can't get over you 

I can remember calling your phone and hanging up
Cause I was to afraid to talk, if by chance you picked it up
But now that I done thought about it, 
I'd feel better if we talk about it
And let you know what's on my mind
See I want to try to make things right.


No doubt about it I'm sorry for the way things worked out
If I could change it I would change it but I don't know how
(No I can't ain't no need to cry when I know the reason why)
You chose to leave me but I still wish you were here with me

Its true I can't get over you 
No matter what I do 
Even if I try I, I can't get over you 

Lately I've been doing some reminiscing
I'd be lying if I said that I don't miss you
I have feelings from deep in the past
Cause now I need you back
It wasn't so bad

Its true I can't get over you 
No matter what I do 
Even if I try I, I can't get over you 

Its true I can't get over you 
No matter what I do 
Even if I try I, I can't get over you 

I can't get over you
I can't get over you
No I can't get over
Said no way I can't get over
I can't get over you
Alright yea yea",Get Over You

You probably think it's my girls
But when you got the love
It's not like you ain't calling home

Last night, I thought about if this should end
I should be starting a new life
So tonight, I'm hanging wit my girlfriends
And I'm starting a new life

If you know they just copped Shaq, you got the floor seats

BAPE, BBC, Three Dots and all that there (what?)
I spent green mayne on that bling chain
Make ya scream like the silly nigga from Ying Yang (HAAH!)

Faith Evans,"I knew from the start you were running game
You'd fade away like Jordan then cross me over when you come back again
I'm not superwoman so I can't see what's going on in your mind
It's been so long that I strung you along
So many dates, so many hours on the phone
And I know you getting tired of playing the game of cat and mouse
I wonder if I let you catch me, would you run your mouth
So I'm not sure if I want to

Stop
Go
Just move slow
Let
Go

We're in the first quarter and I feel I want to but I know we oughta not
'Cause if I pass it to you there's a chance that you might mess around and drop the rock
So you better make sure in the court you're the best I've ever seen
'Cause I would hate to have to trade you to another team
It's been so hard playing my emotions off
Knowing that I want to give in but too afraid to go too far
And I know you're getting tired of playing the game of hard to get
But I wonder if I let you in would you tell your friends
So I'm not sure if I want to

Stop, go
Just move slow
Let go
And enjoy the moment
Stop, go
So confusing that I
Don't know
I feel I want to explode

My heart, says yes
My mind, says no
'Cause I don't know if I want to break down and let go
My heart, says yes
My mind, says no
'Cause I know if I'm ready now I'll be wanting more
More this, more that
More time, to chat
And I'll be wanting a commitment from you and much more attention

That's why I'm so confused
When it comes to loving you

That's how long we've been havein' this thing
We've got every moment hasn't been perfect
But still when it's perfect it feels
Like we're the only people who have somethin' real
Now 3 years two weeks
That's how long we've been raisin' our family
And I wouldn't go tradin
The love we got
So don't go changin'
I love you just the way you are

It's true love
When you say I need me like the way i need you
And you can't be without me
Like I can't be without you
It's true love
When we spend time talking on the phone
Cause when we're not around each other you don't want to be alone
It's true love, love, love, love
Don't you know it's good to be in love, love, love, love
Just believe me truthfully cause
Love is never ever makin you cry
Before I tell you a lie
I'll give you my life
Cause that true love

Now when the love is right
Somehow you just know
Because you hold it tight
And you don't want to let it go
And it's so deep inside of you that
You just can't take it cause it fills up your heart
And you just, you can't replace it alone
Somebody's makin love
Non-stop tonight
And And they can't make enough
I know what it feels like
Grab your lover by the hand
Say that you understand
How love really works
So good that it hurts

Cause I don't need nobody but you in my life oh baby
Those of you who understand what I'm sayin'

Faith Evans,"Love was just a four letter word
Misused to entrust the heart of followers

Then you curved my whole attitude

See really what I'm tryin' to say is I like what I'm feelin' 
And I hope you never take it away

I never gave my heart to love
I never gave my time to love
I never even cared for love
Until you came

I never gave my time to love
I never even cared for love
And then you came, baby I

I can't believe you walked through my defenses
And made me smooth out my rough ends and
You got me open and I'm hopin' that this ain't no act
'Cause I don't want no parts of that
Matter fact, I really hope that you're true
'Cause I want to invest my time in you
And all my childish dreams with all my conversations

I just don't trust you. But my mama said work with it, you know what I mean?
It's like I've been going through all these emotions
And I'm dealin' with stuff I've never dealt with before

Never took the time to know you
Nothing that you say ever gets through
Listening but they don't hear you

I was gone already
I was gone already
Understanding now you're ready
But I already been gone
Gone already
Gone already
Nothing that you can tell me
'Cause I already been gone

I was feeling like a dead man walking
Numb from all the pain you're causing
Hoping that things would change
But you never gave me that option
There's so many things that you don't
Do to make me overlook the wrong

This is not the way that love should be
Guess you're not the man for me

I was gone already
I was gone already
Understanding now you're ready
But I already been gone
Gone already
Gone already
Nothing that you can tell me

Packed my bags made up my mind
Left the keys behind
Hoping I could make it disappear
I could be a million miles from here
Obligation made me stay
As long as I did that's my mistake
Boy just holding on when
When I know that I

I was gone already
I was gone already
Understanding now you're ready

You still knock me of my feet,
It feels like day one is on repeat.
I still love you, you're still fond of me,
Still make me laugh; you put a smile on me.

Baby you're the only one that makes me feel this way!
Feels just like the beginning, I hope there is no ending,
You're my lover friend!

And I deserve to dance the night away
Let it go and let the music take you
'Cause we came in through all night until the day
Are you feeling what the beat does to you?
Just let it through you
Send a message to the DJ

'Cause I know that you came to party
So move your body to the floor
Get you back up on the wall
'Cause I know that you came to party
So move your body to the floor
Get you back up on the wall

It's Friday night let the party begin
Leave your stress out at the door
Have no worries on the dance floor
DJ want you please play my favorite song?
Nothing can go wrong

So move your body to the floor
Get you back up on the wall

One time two times STOP
I came to party
I'm a G male
Tell you female
I just parked up in a hot Ferrari
Look it mummy she likes my style
How's to party how I keep down
Kick your booty then I skip town
Go ridiculous go get drawn
I'm a hot male now
Too hard to handle
Back in the party in a limo
Jimmy shoe tattoo on the sandal
Race on in a bake it's just a gamble
Yeah we're famou' and we get it in
Stand in the mirror acting like skin
Boy when I spin I blow the

I knew that I wanted to
Take a chance on something new
I remember how I felt on that day
When you took my breath away
Words could not explain

And I knew from the start, 
From the beat of my heart, it was true
I had to have you
I don't know if it's real, 
But I know how I feel about you
There's somethin' bout the way you move
Somethin' 'bout the way you move
You're style is crazy sexy baby, I really like it
I been holding back so long 
But this feeling's getting stronger
There's something bout the way you move

When I see you I can't even lie, 
You always blow my mind
And I start to feel those butterflies
Like a little kid in a candy store, 
I want it more and more
It's just a matter of time before I make you mine

Can you hear me now? Tell me, tell me how you like it
I'll stay with you if you stay with me
I got faith in you, you got faith in me?
We'll take flicks together, two steps together
Dancin', glancing, takin' chances
I'm chillin' like feelin' like this is
The one that I'm gon' make my Mrs
We're high when we touch ? tough
We lie in the cut, I don't do much
Being wit you, being wit me
Seeing it through, faithfully
I'll wait for you if you wait for me, gracefully, patiently

What you and your man do in the bedroom
Might feel good when you in it
And you probably want to admit it
But it ain't nobody business
Number two, gotta be a pretty girl all the time (take it from your highness)
Gotta build him up and make him strong
You gotta be the only one he want

Tell him you love him before he step out the door
Number five, gotta let him wear the pants
You be a lady and you let him be the man
Number six, know how to put it down in the kitchen
When he bring it home you gotta have a good meal fixed
Seven, this rule is so underrated, gotta keep your feelings and your money separated
It's okay to let him have control
But girl, you gotta have your own
Do your own thing
Number eight, gotta keep your head game straight
Number nine, shoulda been number one to me
Gotta take care of the family

And it caught me by surprise
But it was only for a moment
And just around the eyes
 
Something in your touch
Took me back a long way
And made me say the wrong name
I wish I could explain

But if I had to tell you
Where a small resemblance lies
It's something in your touch 
And just around the eyes

I'm over him completely
I rarely think about him at all
So when I look at you
Tell me, what should I do
With the little bit of him that I saw
 
Only when you smiled
You could have bowled me over
A memory out of nowhere
That came and went so fast

Don't tell me I still love him
That has to be a lie
It's just something in your touch
And only when you smile

And only for a moment

She taught her early how to smile that smile and wave from the parade
It took a whole lot of years and tears
For her momma to finally admit
No matter how many stitches and pins
That old dress was never gonna fit

She was daddy's little girl
Momma's little angel
Teacher's pet, pageant queen
She said ""All my life I've been pleasin' everyone but me,
Living someone else's dream""

Her daddy used to say, ""You'll make a lovely bride someday
He'll ride up on big white horse and just carry you away""
It took twenty-five years and some broken vows
Before they'd finally see
There's a little more to love and life
Then fairy tales and hand me down dreams

She said ""All my life I've been pleasin' everyone but me,

I've been stripped down, bare, 'til I break
Still the wheel keeps turning

Had me a sweet one, I tell no lie
Summer nights in the cornfields
When the corn gets so high
We traveled clear across Wichita, headin' north
Leavin' civilization

And there were highways to get across
And places far from here
And I was his lonesome prairie
And he was my wild frontier

Harvested peaches in a small border town
Saved all our wages
Put ten percent down
I never thought I'd see the world through a child's eyes
Until early December

Then one Calgary morning
Still as glass
While my baby lay sleeping, an angel slipped past
And with one breath said I'm taking him back
To his Father in Heaven

Through gravel and ice and new fallen snow
I held him through my tears
Because I was his lonesome prairie
And he was my wild frontier

Get along, get along, get along
Get along, get along, get along
Oh, oh, oh
Get along, get along, get along
Get along, get along, get along
Oh, oh, oh

And sometimes at night
I swear I can hear him
Calling out so clear
He says, ""You were my lonesome prairie
And I'm still your wild frontier""

Get along, get along, get along
Get along, get along, get along
Oh, oh, oh
Get along, get along, get along
Get along, get along, get along
Oh, oh, oh

Faith Hill,"Couple of guys sittin' around drinkin'
Down at the Starlight Bar
One of 'em says, ""You know I've been thinking""
Other one says, ""That won't get you too far""

He says, ""This is your life, and welcome to it
It's just workin' and drinkin' and dreams
Ad on TV says ?Just Do It'
Hell if I know what that means""

The secret of life is a good cup of coffee
The secret of life is keep your eye on the ball
The secret of life is a beautiful woman
And Marilyn stares down from the barroom wall

""You and me, we're just a couple of zeros
Just a couple of down-and-outs
But movie stars and football heroes
What have they got to be unhappy about?""

So they turn to the bartender, ""Sam, what do you think?
What's the key that unlocks that door?""
Sam don't say nothin', just wipes off the bar
And he pours them a couple more

'Cause the secret of life is in Sam's martinis
The secret of life is in Marilyn's eyes
The secret of life is in Monday Night Football
Rolling Stones records and Mom's apple pie

Sam looks up from his Sunday paper
Says, ""Boys, you're on the wrong track
The secret of life is there ain't no secret
And you don't get your money back""
Hey

The secret of life is gettin' up early
The secret of life is stayin' up late
The secret of life is try not to hurry
But don't wait
Don't wait

The secret of life is a good cup of coffee
The secret of life is keep your eye on the ball
The secret of life is to find the right woman
The secret of life is nothin' at all
Oh, it's nothin' at all

And every tear He'll wipe away
The darkness will be gone,the weak shall be strong

Innocence is lost, and hopes are shattered
The old are forgotten, the children are forsaken

You pulled the wool over my eyes
Should've seen it coming baby
Now all I see is a cool love dying

Honey I don't want to hold you down
Why you gotta own the lock and the key
Oh tell me baby
Good things just don't come around

And you can't have them for free
No not me
You've been a river of give
And an ocean of take
Darlin' for heaven's sake

You've got me up and down and in between
Acting nice then being real mean
Hey
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back

Who could deal with that
You say you want to work it out, boy
Tell me what's in it for me

You're living in your own world
You act like I'm just passing through
Oh yeah
Don't you want to be happy

Don't you know how good I could be
Seems everybody's telling you something
That they know you just want to hear
Oh but you ain't gonna hear it from me

You've been a valley of love
And a mountain of need
Baby, it's time you see

You've got me up and down and in between
Acting nice then being real mean
Hey
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back

Who could deal with that
You say you want to work it out, boy
Tell me what's in it for me

Up and down and in between

Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush

I lie in bed and watch the shadows 
Dancing across the wall
Nothing to do but think of you 
And count the tears that fall

Oh, how I wish it was real
I wish I could feel you holding me close
The only thing I know for sure 
Is I should've never let you go

I would walk the world across the sea
Journey beyond the moon 
I try anything, go anywhere 
To find my way back to you
 
I still don't understand the reason
I think I was just afraid (what can I say)
All I can do is face the truth 
And deal with the mess that I made

Now all I want is the chance to take it back 
And go on like this
Because ever since we said goodbye 
I've been lost in loneliness
 
[Chorus]
 
Now baby I was wrong 
Now that you're gone 
The only thing left to do
Is spend every day 

Stray every way 
To find my way back to you
 
I know that I was a fool 
To push you away
And if you let me back in your life
Baby, I swear all my heart 
And in your arms I will stay

It's like everything I've ever known is a lie

Like you're touching the wings of a butterfly
I wish we could just lock ourselves away in a room
Where there was no such thing as time

I've never let anyone get this close
I've always been afraid
But you break down every wall 
And I feel so safe
 
Every part of who I am
Is so in love cause what I have is beautiful

Faith Hill,"If I had just one tear running down your cheek
Maybe I could cope maybe I'd get some sleep
If I had just one moment at your expense
Maybe all my misery would be well spent

Could you cry a little?  Lie just a little?
Pretend that you're feeling a little more pain?
I gave, now I'm wanting something in return
So cry just a little for me

If your love could be caged, honey I would hold the key
And conceal it underneath the pile of lies you handed me
And you'd hunt and those lies, they'd be all you'd ever find
That'd be all you'd have to know for me to be fine, yeah

And you'd cry a little
You'd die just a little
And baby I would feel just a little less pain
I gave, now I'm wanting something in return
So cry just a little for me

Give it up baby
I hear you're doing fine
Nothing's gonna save me
I can see it in your eyes

I don't want pity
I just want what is mine

Faith Hill,"I had it tough when I was just a little kid
It didn't matter what I thought
It didn't matter what I did

I felt the doubt for what I lacked
Right from the start
It did a number on my head
But it could never touch my heart

'Cause I had just enough imagination
Just enough to keep the faith
That somehow I would think of what to do
When I get lost in a momentary weakness of emotion
Honey angels came around to help me through

Life pulls fast changes
Winds blows past pages
All I see is I don't need this
High-strung tight rope walk
Ticking time bomb clock
Scratch my name
Cut these chains

I'm free
Kicking out of that prison
I am free
Singing those words of wisdom
Let it be
Nobody gonna put the blues inside of me

I've been stressed to be the best, 
I've done it all
I've slammed the doors, I've jammed the locks
I've paved the bricks, I've built the wall
No one could tell me back then
What joy eluded me
Kept bumping into that misery
Locked up deep down inside of me

Took that rage and I
Turned that page and I
Packed my tools, went back to school
Yeah, and I passed my graduation
And I hold my PhD in
Crash test blues, 
I've paid those dues

I'm free
Kicking out of that prison
I am free
Singing those words of wisdom
Let it be
Nobody gonna put those blues inside of me

And paper scraps and songs
Here I stand in ruby slippers
Three taps take me home

I'm free

I'm free
Kicking out of that prison

I am free
Singing those words of wisdom
Let it be (let it be!)

Ain't no reason to believe
But don't worry baby
Don't you worry
Maybe this is what we need

A little bruising, a little bleeding
Some space that we can breathe in
Some silence in between

So cry for me baby, and I'll cry for you
And we'll both break down and we'll both break through
We'll find our way and we'll face the truth
We both will be stronger
And we'll lie down in our loneliness
And wake up with our sad regrets
Even though we don't know it yet
We both will be stronger
We both will be stronger

I can't believe you're really gone now
But I know it's for the best
And I know that we weren't right
But I still reach for you each night
And man that hurts like hell

So cry for me baby, and I'll cry for you
And we'll both break down and we'll both break through
We'll find our way and we'll face the truth
We both will be stronger
And we'll lie down in our loneliness

For the drop of the name, the parties, the pills

When the lights go down
When the lights go down

At the end of the day when this game that I play
Has gone another round
As I lay there alone on this big empty bed
With nothing but thoughts of you in my head
I think of the things that I wish I had said
When you were still around

When the lights go down and there's nothing left to be
When the lights go down and the truth is all you see
And I wonder if all my life's about the sum
Of all my fear and all my doubts
When the lights go down

[Chorus]",When the Lights Go Down
Faith Hill,"Thought I saw you today
You were standing in the sun then you turned away
And I knew it couldn't be
But my heart believed

Oh, it seems like there's something everyday
How could you be so far away

When you're still here
When I need you, you're not hard to find
You're still here

I can see you in my baby's eyes
And I laugh and cry
You're still here

I had a dream last night
That you came to me on silver wings
And I flew away with you on a painted sky
And I woke up wondering
What was real
Is it what you see and touch
Or what you feel

'Cause you're still here
Oh, you're everywhere we've ever been
You're still here

I heard you in a stranger's laugh
And I hung around to hear him laugh again
Just once again

You were standing in the sun then you turned away

Let down the guard that you hold so high

Uncover your secrets

Give me your trust
Oh, my love is strong enough

The ghosts that you fight with the lone at night
The fears that confront you

Faith Hill,"Good mornin' dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To watch two people we know
Make a big mistake
They'll stand up at the altar
And solemnly swear ""I do""
They'll be together forever
'Til they find somebody new

Her daddy's in the front row
Mutterin' ""Oh no, here we go again""
They had a couple dates
Now she's three months late
And it's twenty bucks a plate I spent, oh

Good mornin' dearly beloved
I'd like to welcome y'all
To see the side effects
Of sex and alcohol
Please bow your heads and join me
In a prayer for these two
Who'll be together forever
'Til they find somebody new

The bride is a flirt and the groom is worse
As he's putting the ring on her
He's checkin' out the bridesmaids
Thinkin' that he might take
The maid of honor's honor, oh

Welcome dearly beloved
We are here this afternoon
To throw rice as these two
Drive down the road to ruin
With cans tied to the bumper
And a draggin' muffler too
They'll be together forever
'Til they find somebody new

So raise your glass and join me
Here's to the bride and groom
They'll be together forever
'Til they find somebody new",Dearly Beloved
Faith Hill,"Before you met me I was a fairy princess
I caught frogs and called them prince
And made myself a queen
And before you knew me I'd traveled 'round the world
And I slept in castles
And fell in love
Because I was taught to dream

I found mayonnaise bottles and poked holes on top
To capture Tinker Bell
And they were just fireflies to the untrained eye
But I could always tell

'Cause I believe in fairy tales
And dreamer's dreams
Like bedsheet sails
And I believe in Peter Pan
And miracles, anything I can to get by
And fireflies

Now before I grew up I saw you on a cloud
And I could bless myself in your name
And pat you on your wings
And before I grew up I heard you whisper so loud
Well life is hard and so is love
Child, believe in all these things

I found mayonnaise bottles and poked holes on top
To capture Tinker Bell
And they were just fireflies to the untrained eye
But I could always tell

'Cause I believe in fairy tales
And dreamer's dreams
Like bedsheet sails
And I believe in Peter Pan
And miracles, anything I can to get by...
And fireflies...

Before you met me I was a fairy princess
I caught frogs and called them prince
And made myself a queen

As you did last night
Underneath the city lights
There, walking with your friend
Laughing at the moon
I swear you looked right through me

How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye?

Did you forget the passion?

Well, it's a long way from Star, Mississippi
To the big stage I'm singing on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight

That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
That I've really always been

They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from
That's just me chasing dreams

Faith Hill,"The train pulled into Paris
Like a rocket to the moon.
The station's like a circus

Every face is a cartoon.
And everyone's stoned on pride
And drunk on cheap champagne.

Tonight this joie de vivre
Sure don't live up to its name.
Now all I can say is

I'd give this world to you
Every rock and every stone
Every masterpiece in Rome

And if you'd ask me to
I'd steal the Mona Lisa
Tear it up in little pieces

And lay them at your feet
For all the world to see.
But tonight I can't give you Paris.

Aristicats are everywhere
And the air is as thick as thieves.
She'd like nothing better than to

Steal the breath from me.
And the tower's lights ain't shinin'
As it hangs its head in shame

At the sight of American blood
On the streets of St. Germain
Washin' up into the Seine

And I'd give this world to you
I'd steal the crown and kingdom
From the Queen of England

And if you'd ask me to
I'd take this city in my hands
Break it down to grains of sand

And lay them at your feet
For all the world to see.
But tonight I can't give you Paris.",Paris [*]

Hey that's the way we like it

Says, ""Boys, you're on the wrong track
The secret of life is there ain't no secret
And you don't get your money back""

Faith Hill,"They said change your clothes,
She said no I won't,
They said comb your hair,
She said some kids don't,
And her parents dreams went up in smoke.

They said you can't leave,
She said yes I will,
They said don't see him,
She said his name is Bill,
She's on a road and its all uphill.

[Chorus]
She's a wild one,
With an angel's face,
She's a woman child in a state of grace,
When she was three years old on her daddy's knee,
He said you can be anything you want to be,
She's a wild one,
Runnin' free.

She loves rock and roll,
They said it's Satan's tongue,
She thinks they're too old,
They think she's too young,
And the battle lines are clearly drawn.

She has future plans,
And dreams at night,
They tell her life is hard,
She says that's all right, yeah,

No crib for His bed

But little Lord Jesus
No crying He makes

I love Thee, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my side

A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight

Gone away, is the bluebird
Here to stay, is the new bird

Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?""
We'll say ""No man""
You can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream, by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman

Cause' I keep lookin' and huntin' just like a lion
Let the sucka' know that it's them that be dyin'
I show no remorse to the source of the tales
And if they tell then the hungry better battle

Aw I keep it comin' and comin' across the table
And if I miss, I never miss, 'cause I'm able
I'm lookin' forward and I'm lookin' over my shoulder
And I'll make a simple sin to make the bonus
But I'll never bless the rest, so never cease
I'll do a motherfucker with this restin' piece
Cause' what they saw they never seen or even heard of
And if they live, it's just another body murdered....
.....another body murdered....

(patton)

I'm makin' deals for deals that make a kill
And anyone looking gonna' get that ass killed
I'm livin' like a criminal and criminal I be
And I'm respected in the hood like a 'g'
But if they think I'm blasted then they gone
I'm takin' off they're head with a motherfuckin' chrome
I gotta pay the play the pay ta' get crooked
And I ain't 'boo' til' I dump another fool
I see the fool runnin' and runnin' but where they goin' ?
Had to witness my murder now they knowin'
What they blast so blast so at the pad
I'll have the thing fixed...my life was goin' in a flash....if I went to say
---- that'd be my ass
Searching for these fools while stepping cross the squares
Cause they can't hide and hide and that's real
And what you just witnessed with your eyes got ta' kill....
.....another body murdered.....

Bang your head to this....turn me up!....another body murdered

(once again, mr. patton)

...faith no more....
I had to get it together to watch a body get murdered, ehh...boo-yaa
T.r.i.b.e...

I have to get it together to watch a body get murdered

Bang your head...come on...bang your head....
....bang your head.......bang you head to this....

(more patton)

I see a fool an' I try an' test the fool
I testify that the fool will have to lose
Boo-yaa t.r.i.b.e. gotta keep it low
Cause the brother that was shot with my motherfuckin uz..ooooh...
As I bail with my head up
Round they crowd someone kicks my luck and then I get up
All these busters on my trail
Well they get where I'm at, but the fail cause' they can't bail
I keep bailin' I been stickin' my shit ever since they've had me jailed in
But it ain't all about servin' time...
It's about breakin' down the verd(ict) and servin' mine....

Another pass or passive
You wanta' play it by the ridd did the king start blastin'
All these fools goin' up they sigh
They try to test mine
They never get to know why
Oooh how long can you live when a gangster like the ridd keep smokin' that
Ass.....

Recently Mama's crying all the time 
Is it because of me or my younger sister, 
Even Dad was weeping when he kissed her.
Face all puffy like a blister, 
Crying like he missed her. 
Since we moved away from the house,
Where we used to play.
They say I'll understand on day but I doubt it, 
Mama never say nothing about it. 
How'd it get to be so crowded.
I found it a strain, everywhere I look I see pain.
And I can't escape the feeling, 
Maybe I'm to blame. 
So I strain to listen, 
Praying for a decision, wishing they where kissing.
This feels like extradition or exile, 
Mama finds it hard to smile
So I make pretend cups of coffee in her favorite style.
She says child I'm working so there's nothing you lack.
But she know I want my Dad I want my family back.

I'm on Lonely Street, age forty three.
Couldn't gauge when to quit so my wife quit me.
Took offense, took the kids,
I wish that was the end.
But before she took her leave 
She took care of my best friend.
Working all the hours. 
God send was not the tactic
You see, because after ten years I'm
? Wanted to make the cash
Quick so I had to work real late. 
Bad sex, my woman's vex, even if I stay awake.
And if I'm honest, I had a little cake at the office.
I was eating. We'd do our cheating over coffees,
Making tea for the bosses. 
Making free with me,
And I agree I got sleazy too easily.
But I'm forty three, 
This doesn't usually happen to me.
Now I'm lonely, 
I wonder what my son's doing today.
Suddenly I'm blinking like the screen 
On my computer display. 
And I'm drinking.
Concerned about what's down the track 
If I don't get my family back.

But yo it gets busy at night, People creeping.
Derelicts sneaking to fix. Speaking.
On the way my timbers creaking,
Roof leaking. And bricks coming loose, 
Knee high in refuse.
But even though I'm a slum,
I'm still of some use.
There was a time when my walls where decorated.
And under my roof children where educated.
But now paint's faded, windows are all smashed,
A crash in the economy robbed me of my family.
And no strategy, combats negative equity,

To come meet me in the twilight zone
Leave your mobile phone at home and come alone

Identified by the dying ring of her goodbye

Trust me, nothing ever moves but the dust,
There's just us and I'm here to torment and tease
And that's how it was for centuries

Took the couple of Saturdays
I moved in runnin' from tragedies and boozing
Seven hundred years since I came here
You appear, same hair, same quizzical stare
I couldn't get near,
And the sheer frustration was more than I could bear
I was really cursed, thought I'd been through the worst part

That was just the first part, just the start
Every night I'd be sittin' with dread pickin' my heart
In case the man she'd been chasin' gets to first base
An' I just can't escape, I'm in bad shape
You making love to someone else is more than I can take
And so I make all the movement I can to no avail

J, I'm going insane with shame
I dream and watch her makin' love over and over again
With what I call a farmer's swain
Unintelligent, pea-brained retard who's dick is always hard
Oh God, of course I'm jealous, fellows,
Oversexed flexing his pec's
Jesus, what's he going make her do next?
I'm mad vex, the way she gently scratches his chest
You used to do that to me back in 1253
Pity me, while you lie with your lover
I stare and suffer in despair while you ruffle his hair
Unaware of who else is there
I move quick, I want to try my trick one last time
You know it's possible to vaguely define my outline
When dust move in the sunshine
So I'm tryin' to change, vibrate myself to near-human pitch
Which reminds me how I used to come unstitched
And switch 'round the house in a blind rage
It took years and an ocean of tears to find the key to this
Cage
And write another stage into a new age,
It's difficult to gauge
But I know that I'll see you again, on that you may depend
I just don't know how or when
Sleep on, my lost love on gone

Faithless,"I'm on lonely street age nearly three
Recently Mama's crying all the time 
Is it because of me or my younger sister, 
Even Dad was weeping when he kissed her.
Face all puffy like a blister, 
Crying like he missed her. 
Since we moved away from the house,
Where we used to play.
They say I'll understand on day but I doubt it, 
Mama never say nothing about it. 
How'd it get to be so crowded.
I found it a strain, everywhere I look I see pain.
And I can't escape the feeling, 
Maybe I'm to blame. 
So I strain to listen, 
Praying for a decision, wishing they where kissing.
This feels like extradition or exile, 
Mama finds it hard to smile
So I make pretend cups of coffee in her favorite style.
She says child I'm working so there's nothing you lack.
But she know I want my Dad I want my family back.

I'm on Lonely Street, age forty three.
Couldn't gauge when to quit so my wife quit me.
Took offense, took the kids,
I wish that was the end.
But before she took her leave 
She took care of my best friend.
Working all the hours. 
God send was not the tactic
You see, because after ten years I'm
? Wanted to make the cash
Quick so I had to work real late. 
Bad sex, my woman's vex, even if I stay awake.
And if I'm honest, I had a little cake at the office.
I was eating. We'd do our cheating over coffees,
Making tea for the bosses. 
Making free with me,
And I agree I got sleazy too easily.
But I'm forty three, 
This doesn't usually happen to me.
Now I'm lonely, 
I wonder what my son's doing today.
Suddenly I'm blinking like the screen 
On my computer display. 
And I'm drinking.
Concerned about what's down the track 
If I don't get my family back.

I want my family back

I'm on Lonely Street, number fifty three.
Boarded up property, 
I'll probably get pulled down.
Litter all around inside there's 
No sound and no light.
But yo it gets busy at night, People creeping.
Derelicts sneaking to fix. Speaking.
On the way my timbers creaking,
Roof leaking. And bricks coming loose, 
Knee high in refuse.
But even though I'm a slum,
I'm still of some use.
There was a time when my walls where decorated.
And under my roof children where educated.
But now paint's faded, windows are all smashed,
A crash in the economy robbed me of my family.
And no strategy, combats negative equity,
So that's it. Like violence it's drastic.
I'm freaking, and seeking to be 
More than just a house for crack.

Unsung champion, reason, like seasoning

Think what I think with my prayers. It's nice. My world is everything I've become
Contained in the hum between voice and drum
I'm coming from the same place I'm still running from
But even sitting in the garden one can still get stung",The Garden (End of Summer Intro)

The sky is victorious but here comes the rain
Friday is taking me home again,
And I've nothing but you on my mind.

Grass is greener without the pain,
I think that I'm changing but I'm just the same
My sun is a ascending again
And I've nothing but you on my mind

Sometimes I feel like I'm glad to be free,
Sometimes I still want your arms around me
Sometimes I'm glad to have left you behind,
The Crazy English Summer has put you back on my mind.
Life's a riot a lover a friend,
Pity the day that it has to end
Friday come speed me home again,
I've nothing but you on my Mind.

Sometimes I'm weak and the past is my guide,

Today i woke up feeling sad
I know that you said,
That one day i would be glad
Hold the choirs of winter,

The birds are calling to me and
All the leaves i came to love are falling
Ribbons on evergreen, owls that pull them apart
I can hear you singing my funny valentine
Oh you know that breaks my heart
Hold the choirs of winter,
The birds are calling to me and
All the leaves i came to love

Oh you know that breaks my heart
Oh you know that breaks my heart

Running with my rain face on
No idea of what to say
No idea of who to do
In this fear that never goes
Waiting for all my dreams
Oh you know it breaks my heart

All the leaves i came to love

Faithless,"""Do what I have to""
Remember Emily?
""That's a long time"" [2x]
In a long dress one summer day she said yes
Now every special request requires another
So many times it feels endless, a big yes
Branded red on each breast
But she selfless out there
Doing her best strangest thing
Nobody seemed to be impressed.
The more she do for this fool
The more she behind schedule
Had no fun for so long
Old records turned her onto High School flings
And she was full of daring

Colourful hair, used to wear thirteen rings
Now she staring drudgery
Full in the face and accepts it as her place
And just in case there's anything she missed,
She recheck the list
Does it over again,
To make sure it's spotless.

Jimmy longed for how it used to be,
She was viscous and volatile
She was feisty, iced tea was the tipple never asked nicely,
Her lips used to curl down ever so slightly, impolite,
Fire burned bright behind the Oakleys,
He just had to get to grips.

After a few long sips juice begin to lose flavour,
She no longer gets to savour being consumed.
Jimmy asleep drunk in the other room still in his shoes
Escaping headlong into the booze,
The whole house vibrating with the changes of moods.

From feisty she turned into ""be nice to me""
In the old days he'd 've been wearing Ice T,
Jimmy prayed those times times returned,
She was fine and so beautifully unconcerned.

Jimmy told her, on the day he quit
""You don't love me you love the relationship""

Me?
I'm the progeny product of Misogeny,
Jimmy and Emily's homogeny
They promised me nothing but honesty,huh,
And that's all I got,
I could never be the cement in their destiny,
They still haven't forgiven me,
You know my own woman's leaving me
Said she stopped believing me,
Can't even see what she saw in me,
I told my woman she was beautiful,
She didn't believe,
Convinced herself I was preparing to leave,
so she took my son and left the world to freeze.

I told my woman she was beautiful Ten Times a Day,
Ten Times a Day she'd Smile, and look away.

I end up throwing my love down a bottomless pit.
And giving myself away...",Giving Myself Away

You won't do what you'd like to do.
Lay back and let me show you another way.
I'll kill what you want me to,
Take what's left and eat it.
Take all or nothing.
Life's just too short to push it away.
Take it all.
Take it all in.
All the way in.
Let it go.
Let it go in.
You won't feel what you'd like to feel.

Knock you down,

Here we go

In these struggled times

And bring people together with strength of feeling

Born to fly but we stay grounded and I don't know why
We have a powerful tool, no need to cry
With it you separate the truth from a lie

The point I want to make
Is you could never escape from your fate
The mistake is to take without giving
So, break the tradition

Make a decision, cause no matter how hard you try
You're still in prison
If ya born with wings and you never fly
Listen, you don't stop

To a three room nest, eats and sleeps

Goes to school, learns to read an write
Probably follows a team with his friends
And gets to ride the train
Probably fall in love
Probably get to fly on a plane
Get to work all week and spend what he earns
On the high street

He's got doctors, nurses, fireman, churches
Kindergartens, wedding bells and jet black hurses
Passport, bank card, maybe his own yard
Locks and alarms, trinkets and charms
Maybe a baby in his arms.


My baby was born on his knee, one of poverty's offspring
Can into the world coughing, already full of mama's disease
Went back to a flat with no gas, no cash
Wrapped in a duvet full of cigarette ash
Mama can't get no sleep
Baby never quiet enough to eat

Goes to school, learns to steal and fight

Go steam those trains

On a far and distant shore
Of which, when sold, could feed a good few
Hey mister rich - Why don't you help the poor

Finally Fatty Boo you stood with me in '73
Saturday night playing the music at my father's party
Six records on the changer often with Dan Settee
Still your gram six years old and I'm the man

Steady with calypso to start then play reggae
One thousand bolts of holts, huh, for everybody
In the days when R&B meant Arthur Conroy
Otis Reading, Booker T and the MG's

Every, little piece of attention as we tried to squeeze
From the father, his friends and their families
Sometime deliberately tease with the tune that won't please
And the whole room reaction set my young heart at ease

It used to be black suits and shirts with skinny ties
And they was wise and funny and funny and wise
Staying up late and playing the music
With grown ups was my prize

How you light your cigarette
Head on one side as you pull, you look almost regal.

Wearing one of my shirts and what some call panty hose

Long legs like an antelope

Together thirteen outta twenty four

It's been a long time coming
But its well worth waiting
And I raise my hands
And ask for nothing more

If we are of the same mind, finally
It was worth the calamity of you being mad at me
You know I've got feelings too they come stealing through
And batter me properly revealing my sensitivity
We don't get this time for free
Take my hand and promise me your love and honesty
And this soliloquy would not have been in vain
On our journey of life lets take the slow train

Briefly, this is my testimony
I see genius in everybody
To perceive it in yourself is the difficulty
Where you come from really makes no difference to me
Whether country or just another lonely city
Like a lotus you process the ability
To produce flower and fruit simultaneously

[Chorus: x3]
So drop your pebble in the mainstream
Start a ripple
It will buzz you like a tweak on your nipple
Tickle your sensibility speak just a little
The words have enough weight to turn rock to metal

Like a tweak on your nipple

I see genius in everybody
To perceive it in yourself is the difficulty
But your individuality overflows with quality
It manifests solidly
If you believe
A rich creativity, fever pitch energy
And crazy synchronicity
If you believe

And make my way to the refrigerator
One dry potato inside, no lie
Not even bread, jam
When the light above my head went bam

I can't get no sleep

I can't sleep something's all over me
Greasy, insomnia please release me
And let me dream about making mad love on the heath

Tearing off tights with my teeth
But there's no relief
I'm wide awake in my kitchen
It's black and I'm lonely
Oh if I could only get some sleep
Creaky noises make my skin creep
I need to get some sleep

Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear

Der Lorbeerkranz, ein neuer Tanz
Schwingt Rhythmus in die Hüften der Stadt
Man sieht und kennt und sagt sich
Was diese Nacht zu sagen hat

Fragt nicht nach neuen alten Werten
Seht weißes Licht, seht nur Gefühl
Die Nacht gehört uns bis zum Morgen
Wir spielen jedes Spiel

Lass diese Reise niemals enden
Das Tun kommt aus dem Sein allein
Allein aus Dimensionen, die
Illusionen und Sensationen lohnen

Give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more

Junge Römer - tanzen anders als die anderen
Sie lieben ihre Schwesternliebe lieber als den Rest der Welt
Frag junge Römer - „kennt ihr die Sonne noch?
Sie kennt die Sorgen“
Junge Römer - die Nacht ist jung wie ihr
Vergesst das Morgen

Un ballo nuovo porta ritmo nei fianchi della città
Ci vendiamo, trovimo, chiediamo che cosa si fa
Ma non cercate dei valori, e magari sensazioni
La notte è nostra fino al mattino abbiamo illusion
Non è la fine del viaggio, no, c'è sempre un domani e
Ci sono dimensioni, con illusioni e sensazioni

Give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more, give me more

Und so ein Wunder konnte doch auch niemals sein
Der Tag danach ist da, wir fallen aus den Wolken

Kann, kann es auch mal Liebe sein

Kann, kann es auch mal Liebe
Kann es auch mal Liebe sein

Am Tag danach ist Vollbetrieb auf allen Sternen
Du siehst mich an und denkst es konnte niemals sein
Der Tag danach wir fliegen hoch in weißen Wolken
Man trägt Gefühl, die Zukunft holt uns heute ein

Dann und wann
Kann, kann es auch mal Liebe sein

Und auf eine Art und Weise ist das Spiel der Kinder weise
Wenn sie die Politik des Schwebens zelebrieren
Und die Fußbank zum Aeroplan wird
Nur weil auf Wolke sieben kein Platz zu kriegen war.
Und wir alle sind uns darin einig
Daß das ernste Spiel der Kinder mir der Imagination so dicht ist
So dicht
Daß man nicht mehr hinsehen kann
So dicht
Daß es fast Dichtung ist.

Planted on their columns now that bind me

When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads

Der Mensch, der mir am nächsten ist, bin ich, ich bin ein Egoist
Die ganze Welt dreht sich um mich  

Ganz oben auf der Liste, ja, da stehe ich
Do musst mir schon verzeihen, aber ich liebe mich
Das obwohl übermaßend durchaus kritisch bin,
Hab ich den ganzen lieben Tag nur mich im Sinn 

Ich habe über meinem Bett 'nen Spiegel angebracht,
Damit mein eig'nes Spiegelbild mir meinen Schlaf bewacht
Ich will niemanden wollen, nein, ich will, daß man mich will,
Bis ich kriege, was ich brauche, halt ich niemals still 

Die ganze Welt dreht sich um mich,  

Liebe kommt von Lieben und ich fange bei mir an,
Mit ein bisschen Glück bist eines Tages du 'mal dran
Ich gebe meinem Ego täglich die spezielle Kur,
Nur meisten geb ich mir gleich alles und am liebsten pur - shure 

An jedem Tag an dem es mein Weltbild länger gibt,
Erkenne ich mich selbst und ich bin neu verliebt
Die Sterne schreiben meinen Namen in das Firmament,
Damit er hell in euren Augen brennt 

Die ganze Welt dreht sich um mich,  
Wos is er denn, wos hat er denn, was kann er denn,
Wos mocht er denn, wos red er denn, wer glaubt er, dass er is

Where the royal crown is to be found,
Promising rewards in silver, gold and pounds

When the kind returns from the crusades
There is no big welcome on the shore.

No crystal-ball mange to find

One day they will return, come spring again that's when.
But we will never see our native country again. 

At first we traveled through the English countryside
On tracks and on wagons as quickly as birds would fly.
It was a lovely sight to see the land at last
But all the glorious sights kept flashing by too fast. 

And later when we came to Liverpuddlian Bay
The tears of regret finally started to have their say.
The hearts then started burning in each and everyone
We only talked of Sweden that used to be our home. 

We all were packed together in one unhealthy cave
It was as if we'd stepped into an open grave.
The food that we had brought from blessed Swedish land
Was suddenly forbidden and taken from our hand. 

And when we had been sailing for just a week or two
A horrid kind of darkness was clouding our view.
We couldn't see each other and hardly breathe or walk
It was a gruesome anguish for all people aboard. 

The air was filled with hunger and drenched in wretched cries,
The howling and the noises would pierce right through the skies
And death became the ruler that forces us to our knees.
The dead were buried in the horrid fathom of the seas.",We Sold Our Homesteads

Calling my name all day

Through thunder, storm and rain
On a mission to quell the snakes.

You will search every hole
And turn every stick and stone.
Bring them out to light.

The hooves were pounding over the northland
While the battle cries rise high,
Shaking up the distant skies.
The reaper had them close at hand
Not losing them out of sight
From early morning until the night.

From the southern realm they marched
To gaze into their eyes
Illuminate all the lies

No mercy will be shown
To stop their reckless minds
Burn them out and make them blind

a darker temper started to intrude.

This night of infamy
I will never forget
nor will my brothers,
the vengeance I'll get.
I'll leave you restless,
I'll leave you blind
until one night:
A stab from behind.

Although my eyes beheld cheap
I should not have mistaken the wolves' scent.

Their souls awaits nocturnal domains
their sweet taste of victory is only lent.

Locked behind steel and stone,
locked away by infamy.
Listening to my reflections of life.
Starving us to skin and bone,
leaving us to agony.
Seeing signs too late of their strife.

",The Spectre of Deception
Falconer,"Soaked in the silver rain
They rode through the woods.
Crossed the mountains
And crossed the rivers so deep.
They came at dawn
With fire and steel,
Left at dusk, a trail of flames.

Reach up high to touch the sky,
Brothers in arms side by side.
In defiance we unite
For the glory and victory
And for the times soon to be.

Erik and Valdemar:
The trail of flames will be our harbinger.
Let the fire mark our words.
The trail of flames
Our messenger on black wings,
Let our answer be heard.

Erik:
Ride on for me my friends
And fear no more.
Ride for freedom
And ride for the truth.
We'll come at dawn again
With fire and steel
Leaving nothing but ashes behind.

Valdemar:
Although we're bonded by blood
We're divided by the Lord's pride.
Dishonouring we will not stand
Nor will God who stands by our side.

Falconer,"They burst through the gates
With swords in hand they made their way
Cross the hall of the high lord.

As long as that man lives
Peace will never propagate
Between me and my brothers here
So yield yourself to your fate!

The king stood still in the back,
Grey in face and without will
Not knowing wrong from right.

You have brought shame and disgrace
To soil your fathers' name
And heaven will not easily
Forget the game you've played.

The limbs of the lord was chained,
He was bound to a horse then they rode away
Through a cold winter storm.
Travelling night and day
Through a kingdom of snow
And finally arriving at
The castle of his foes.

He was shackled to the wall,
In the tower high above the ground
He was kept like a common thief.
And meanwhile the brothers three
Feasted into the night
And toasted time after time
Until the morning light.

He was sentenced to death by the blade.
In the name of high treason
He died under the sword.

You have to try to break these chains,
annihilation will grab onto your bone.

Look around, do you see
The beast in you and me?

Take a step into the wild,
Horrific creatures will hide.
You're the terror well disguised,
You're the fear that locks itself inside.

Embrace the untamed
See the grandeur under the grime.

I'll shed no tears for strangers.
Save my crying until another day.
Maybe sorrows are coming my way.

In palest glow the dreams descend.

Don't have the time, I don't feel sad

please wake up.

Falconer,"You grasped a pot of gold,
Now it looks like led.
On your path of hunger
The gold lies still ahead.

At the end of the rainbow
Another rainbow starts.

Try to catch the shadows
And run until you fall.
Strain your nerves to follow
The temptations of them all.

The prizes fade with time
As day fades into night.
The state of satisfaction
Is a slowly dying high.

As sun descends in the sky
The hunt is on for the dawn.
Chasing tricks of the day through the night.

The scent of dawn is so sweet
But it is spoiled with each bite.
Losing pace among all of the treats.

Adorned his cape by thirty runes of gold
Of whom the tales since ages unknown told

The man arrived at the shore of sea
And gazed onto the nightly sky,
His ears could hear and his eyes could see
Two ravens dark as night passing by

In a distance far the thunder sounds
And lightnings reached the frozen grounds,
His breath ran fast, his heart pounded strong
As the day now came, awaited oh so long

Tears will fall and blood will soon be shed
When the dawn heralds the twilight of the day
Then into battle they will ride with their swords in hand
For a heathenish foray

Countless miles he rode through ice and knee-deep snow
Over mountains 'till the landscape changed its face
So he at last arrived where winds blew strong and chill
Like a welcome to all those who trod this place

He in cape was wrapped, and with his hammer 'round his neck
He forced his way though he didn't saw the path,
But he did not rest, 'till he had crossed this land of chill
And the storm had calmed, when he stood alone on hill

His eyes could see the forest shining bright
And it's trees reflected solens golden light,
The sound of horns then reached his ears
To welcome him and take away his fears

From all their lands the kings, they came
With their retinue of countless men,

Peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying ""No once in a while""
""Oh once in a while""

Take your taste, back
Peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying ""No once in a while""
""Oh once in a while""

And did you hear the news?
I could dissect you
And gut you on this stage,
Not as eloquent as I may have imagined
But it will get the job done
And you're, done

Every line is plotted and designed
To leave you
Standing on your bedroom window's ledge
And everyone else
That it hits, that it gets to
Is nothing more than collateral damage

Take your taste, back
Peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying ""No once in a while""
""Oh once in a while""

Take your taste, back
Peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying ""No once in a while""

Fall Out Boy,"Yeah, what you critics said would never happen
We dedicate this album to anybody
People who said
We couldn't make it
To the fans that held us down
Till anybody came around
Welcome... It's here

Last summer we took threes across the board
But by fall we were a cover story
""Now in stores""
Make us poster boys for your scene
But we are not making an accepting speech
I have found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes
Every dot com's refreshing for a journal update

So long live the car-crash heart
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45

So long live the car-crash heart
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45

I can take your problems away
With a nod and a wave
Of my hand
Cause that's just the kind of boy that I am

The only thing I've haven't done yet is die
And it's me and my plus one at the afterlife
Crowds are won and lost and won again
But our hearts beat for the diehards

So long live the car-crash heart
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45

So long live the car-crash heart
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45

Long live the car-crash heart
So long live the car-crash heart

So long live the car-crash heart
Cry on the couch alll the poets come to life
Fix me in 45",Thriller [Live]

In the truly gruesome do we trust
I will always land on you like a sucker punch

Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare

If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sing at you
You would never sing along
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures

Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I'm just numb
And now I'm just numb
Don't mind me, I'm just a son of a gun
So don't stop, don't stop 'till your heart goes numb
And now I'm just numb
I don't feel a thing for you

I'm just a problem that doesn't wanna be solved
So could you please hold your applause
Take this sideshow and all its freaks
And turn it into the silver screen dream

Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare

If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sing at you,
You would never sing along
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures

Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I'm just numb
And now I'm just numb
And don't mind me, I'm just a son of a gun
So don't stop, don't stop 'till your heart goes numb
And now I'm just numb
I don't feel a thing for you

I said one day the bell is gonna swallow me whole
And I feel like a photo that's been overexposed

Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I'm just numb
And now I'm just numb
Don't mind me, I'm just a son of a gun
So don't stop, don't stop 'till your heart goes numb

And I can just die laughing on your spiral of shame

And took you places a basic bitch, she'll never go
Now you running around showing off your camel toe
Got you singing a sad song, call you Satchmo
Then go home and tell your momma about us and we fuss
She called my phone and question me like we love her, she bugging
I think it's better that we end our days and split our ways
Know you like them red bottles, put you right back in them Js
When we go shopping we cop it right then and never wait
When we depart, go put that merchandise on layaway

Well I apologize about last night
I really did not mean to disrespect you

You better be alone
No I'm not obsessed
But if I catch you with somebody else
You know that I'm gonna be upset

I truly believe that the reason I'm here
Is to tell you the truth that your ending is near
One day you must look at yourself in mirror
I still don't think you are hearing me clear
You must understand that our friendship is done
Justified by the person that you have become
And because of the fact that enough is enough
Now I'm the one that is holding the gun!

Because the cops are knocking on the door
They're gonna wanna know what's up!
Better tell them that you fell
Cause when they see the bruises on my face
They're probably taking both of us to jail

I'm sick and tired of fighting each other
The lying, the crying, the calling your mother
The calling of names, I'm bothered and smothered
We kiss and make up, get under the covers
A dangerous cycle I don't understand
The kicking and screaming, the breaking of limbs
I'll be damned if I see you with some other man
If I cannot have you, then nobody can

Whoa
This will be the end of us
I have tried way too many times to heal
I have loved you so much it hurts me dear
And this, this will be the end of us

Death do us part
I thought you would never go straight

Falling in Reverse,"I was born one morning in December
On the coldest day
Abandoned by my mother
By my father I was raised
My father raised my brother and I
With a stubborn heart
My mother left me her good looks and confident charm

Well I spent most of my teenage years
Searching for her love
I could not find it anywhere
So I turned to drugs
And after all the smoke had cleared
And it was said and done
I found myself addicted by the age of twenty one

I tell the truth
I've been beaten
I've been bruised
I was left for dead as well
I was wrongfully accused
You left me locked inside a cell

I've been cheated
I've been sued
But I have lived to tell
The more you kick me when I'm down
The more it truly helps

I feel the madness creeping slowly
Loved by many, I'm still lonely
Paid the price for your mistake
The music died the day I walked away

No, I won't let you win
Not this time my friend
You know that I'm better in the end
No, you won't take my pride
I'll keep my head held high
'Cause I know that I'm better in the end

Woah,
I know you're jealous
And you wish you could be me
I'm so smart and clever with my lyrics can't you see?
There's nobody better in this music industry
And in case you think you are, go ahead, give me a ring

Woah
I deserve a purple heart
From all my fucking wounds
Lacerations to my ego
Pride that I consume

And in your final hours
When you are looking back
You'll find that I'm the best at what I do
And that's a fact

No, I won't let you win
Not this time my friend
You know that I'm better in the end
No, you won't take my pride
I'll keep my head held high
'Cause I know that I'm better in the end
And all got to say

Do do do do do do do do, la la la la la la)

Take it or leave it
But you best believe me it's true
There's no mistaking, please stop thinking I'm through
You know I'm better than you

I've had so many times where I slipped off the beaten path.
I took the time to see the picture in for what it's worth.

Family,"Weaver of life, let me look and see
The pattern of my life gone by
Shown on your tapestry
Just for one second, one glance upon your loom
The flower of my childhood could appear within this room
Does it of my youth show tears of yesterday
Broken hearts within a heart as love first came my way

Did the lifeline patterns change as I became a man
An added aura untold blends as I asked for her hand
Did your golden needle sow its thread virginal white
As lovers we embraced as one upon our wedding night

Did you capture all the joys, the birth of our first son
The happiness of family made a brother for the one
The growing of the brothers, the manliness that grew
Is it there in detail, is it there to view
Do the sparks of life grow bright as one by one they wed
To live as fathers, husbands, apart from lives they've led

Are my lover's threads cut off when aged she laid to rest
My sorrow blacking out a space upon our woven crest
A gathering for the last time as her coffin slowly lain
Ash to ashes, dust to dust, one day we will regain
Does it show the visits when grandchildren on my knee
But only hearing laughter when age took my sight from me

Lastly through these last few years of loneliness maybe
Does by sight a shooting star fade from your tapestry
But wait, there in the distance your loom I think I see
Could it be that after all my prayers you've answered me
After days of wondering I see the reason why
You've kept it to this minute for I'm about to die

The pattern of my life gone by upon your tapestry",The Weaver's Answer

My disconnection is now the issue.....

I miss my 1st love bad and its driving me mad 
Just Like a mixed up crazy person out of his head 
Its been a long long time I've been on the decline 
I do an a-bout face so I can be replaced. 180

Yes, I keep pursuing like a stalker

We used to talk a lot but now she's seemed to disappear

What's going on
About my girlfriend not calling me up on the phone
And if it's gonna be like this everyday I cannot see-cope
So where do I go from here
I found out that she's calling up my best friend
Who said he'd never ever ever go and do this again
I think I'm g'on take this knife outta my back and give it back to him
She just became my Ex-girlfriend

Ok, she kept it on the down-low
So tell me what's the deally-yo
I can't believe she did what she did to me
Alright, now bring me back my things gurl
You're no longer in my world
I don't think that you need to be talking to me
All about how you said you love me
You miss me terribly

Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.
 
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.

Fancy,"Let's not be the ones outside 
Looking at the world go by saw you standing all alone 
Wasted time has gone for good 
Play no more, its understood 
Come to the twilight zone, let me feel your secret hand 
Like a feather on the sand. Only made of gold 
You can make me feel a king 
And surrender everything. A fire can't control 

Hold me in your arms again 
Strangers down a lonely lane 
We can still survive, driftwood on the stream of life 
Hold me in your arms again 
Let me touch your velvet skin 
No more lonely nights on the way of no return 
Play me the bolero 

See your mystery in your eyes 
And the emotion in your lies 
I feel the magic in your touch 
Cause the voiting is too much",Bolero (Hold Me in Your Arms Again)
Fancy,"Once upon a time there was a love
It wasn't meant to be given up
Forever free to shine.
Once it found a way in time and space
Turned our darkness into craze

For life's a lonely lie
No way to lose what I found and silent rain is falling down -
Whenever fools cry

A secret journey
My crusade
A sane and daring masquerade
I'm holding on to you.

Lifetime's another moment with you
Tender and wild
Then a tear of a fool shatters the crystal - why do fools cry ?
