Jim O'Rourke,"Nothing makes me want to disappear
As when someone opens their mouth

It's just my luck
I get hit by a car
While carrying a cake

Dripping cherries
Onto pavement
Bride and groom on my face

I'm not there like a ghost ship in a storm

It only figures
That I'd ride my bike
Into wet cement

And as I'm sinkin'
The last thing that I think
Is did I pay my rent

I ride through like a ghost ship in a storm",Ghost Ship in a Storm
Jim O'Rourke,"I'm going to a place
Where the women have nothing on
But the radio
Turned up to 10
Too loud for me to think
I'm hoping if I blink
I don't wake up here

One of life's greatest sins
Is that you're over when it begins
Goodbye mouth canyon
You were very much to see
But I only came to leave",Happy Holidays
Jim O'Rourke,"There's that word again
Pride
Do you pride yourself on being
Polite?
Do you feel pride when you're alone?

Does the mirror say good day, today?
Does your family make you feel pride?
Do the pictures keep you warm?
Is your smile so easily worn?
Worn away
Do you feel proud?",Movie on the Way Down
Jim O'Rourke,"Like a grain of sand
That wants to be
A rolling stone
I want to be the man
I'm not,
And have the things
I really haven't got
And that's a lot

There'll be joy
And there'll be laughter.
Something big is what I'm after now
Yes, it's what I'm after now

After taking, take up giving,
Something big is what I'm living for
Yes, it's what I'm living for
Living for

Why must I go on
And fill my life with little things
When there are big things I must do
And lots of dreams
That really should come true
Before I'm through",Something Big
Jim O'Rourke,"What you call a pain
I call weeding out
And what you call the rain
Comes out of my mouth

Fuzzy sun
Gets you one by one
Fuzzy sun
Gets the job well done

Rolling drunks for their cigarettes
Frightening babies that aren't born yet

You feel I've passed you by
You feel that you've been robbed
Well nothing will feel worse
Than dying on the job

Fuzzy sun
When you have come undone
Fuzzy sun
A boy must have his fun

A cigarette to brand a baby's arm
A bit of ash in his face keeps him warm",Fuzzy Sun
Jim O'Rourke,"I used to have none
Now with you, I've got one
If I could get just one more
Then you know what you're in for

You ain't getting any sleep tonight
I hope that you girls don't fight
And I hope that you won't run away
'Cause I'm halfway to a threeway

I tried again and again
To indulge in just one sin
All you have to do is lie there
While I push aside your wheelchair

And I do everything it takes
To change your mind and apply your brakes
So I know that you can't roll away
'Cause I'm halfway to a threeway

Can't wipe the smile off my face
When you strut by in your leg brace
You just can't climb the stairs
And you ain't got any hair

I just can't get you to sit
You and your stupid epileptic fits
And I know that you can't run away
'Cause I'm halfway to a threeway

As I lay you down on my bed
It don't matter that you're brain dead
I can get so you close to ya
Now that you're in a coma

I'll make it sweet but short
When I pull out your life support
And I know that you'll just fade away
Now I'm halfway to a threeway
And I know that you'll just fade away
Now I'm halfway to a threeway",Halfway to a Threeway
Jim O'Rourke,"Women look good in, with their suits on
It suits them
Men look good in, with their suits on
It befits them

Women look good in, with men's clothes on
It contains them
Men look good in, with women's clothes on
It betrays them",The Workplace
Jim O'Rourke,"Don't believe a word I say
Not that you would anyway
I may be insincere
But it's all downhill from here

If I seem a bit remote
You'll feel better if you say I'm a misanthrope
Or whatever floats your boat
As for me, I'd rather sink my own

Even though I'm here, you should feel all alone
Maybe the point of this you've just outgrown
There are names for me that are better known
Just draw a line and I'll add my own",All Downhill from Here
Jim O'Rourke,"Get A Room

It's always me in the only seat
That has a canopy
There to screw up the best laid plans
Of those with company

I'd like nothing more to do
Than to watch the desperation on your face
I might send you straght to hell
Like it's worse to end up in this place

If I gave you, one night to live
Would you know who to choose to take home
And if she falls asleep before the night is through
Because she has to go to work
And you don't

And the night's getting longer
And your skin's getting colder
And you won't get much older

And you try to move towards her
But you can't move your shoulder
And you're sight's getting dimmer
Maybe if you kick her
But your leg's getting weaker
And she's such a deep sleeper
And you would get a snorer
To share your last hour
You sure picked a winner
And time's seeming slower
And now you can't see her
All you see is a timer
Moving backwards and forwards
And the night's getting longer
And your skin's getting colder",Get a Room
Jim O'Rourke,"I may be dressed as a doctor dear,
But I'm not, I'm just acting up
Got high hopes, a passing thought

I may act like a bombardier
But don't be fooled, cause my aim is off
No need for alarm, I'll catch you next time

I'd like to raise the Titanic here
Take a walk, through it's molding streets
And feel right at home, 'cause the dead don't talk

It'd be so nice, if you weren't here
Empty air, where you used to stand
Like an empty plate, that gets bussed away",Good Times
Jim O'Rourke,"I'm still waiting
For a sign
That describes
How it's all gonna end
And arrives
At a time
When it seems like
It had failed me

Failed
Once again
Like a friend
Who needs you

Like a house
Needs a floor
To know
When it's been walked on

To know
How it feels
To wait
To be lived in

It would be easy
To stay
This way
If it weren't for
A little problem
That I see
Underneath
Beneath my complaining

Like a wheel
That needs oil
Like a plant
That needs reminding

That it's nothing
Without soil
Although
Then it's stuck there

Like a crumb in bread
Like the seeds in an apple

(Everything
That you felt
Was someone else
Giving you something/
It's never too late
To start to regret
Every step
You've taken
Every word
You've said)",Insignificance
Jim O'Rourke,"You used to be quite content with your shower cap
I guess now I know you feel more at home
With a case of Handi-Wrap

You'd hold your own if you thought that it was clean
At least give me some gloves to wear
Or a picture of St. Augustine

If I were to die with these things on, can't say I didn't try

I'd think that you would try to find something to do
With my old school tie
That doesn't turn my skin blue

Is it hot in here, or do I feel a little draft
From these pants that you brought for me to wear
The ones that have no back

If I were to die with these things on, you might want to try
Another size

I'd take your name, if I thought it'd do me good
If it's all the same to you
I'll just take a look under your hood

If you were to die with this thing on
You coulda chose a better style

And now that you've gone off
And all of this has passed
I don't recall your face no more
But you left behind your mask

If I were to die with these things gone
I'd be frozen with a smile",Life Goes Off

Jim Palmer,"I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didn't run, you didn't hide
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life

My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words they seem to slip away

When I get near you

I'll make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things
I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time

Sometimes I wish I knew you well

When you sigh my inside just flies, (butterflies). 
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you.

It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do.
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you.

Is it right that you and I should fight, (every night)
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright, (very bright)
Haven't I the right to make it up girl.

Why should I feel the way I do.

Jim Penfold,"Your butterfly love just flutters around
From flower to flower, drops their heads to the ground
There're leaves that fall and wither and die
When your butterfly love comes drifting by

I found out just what it is that you like most of all
To take a little honey then let our poor hearts fall
How I got mixed up in this I guess I'll never know
I would like to clip your wings and then tell you no

Your butterfly love just flutters around
From flower to flower, drops the leaves to the ground
There're leaves that fall and wither and die
When your butterfly love comes drifting by

I'm just one of a hundred flowers waiting for your butterfly love

I grew here in a garden with a hundred more or so
I've never dreamed my face would come from a love as pure as snow
Every time I see your wings a floating in the breeze
I know I'm helpless and you come and go just as you please

Your butterfly love just flutters around
From flower to flower drops the leaves to the ground
There're leaves that fall and wither and die
When your butterfly love come drifting by

I'll need a net to catch you and when I finally do
I'll make you taste a bitter love the kind I got from you
I'll take a hundred others and love them one by one
And you can watch just like I did then I'll have all the fun

Jim Penfold,"When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn


And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am",Paradise

Jim Pepper,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Jim Peterik,"There's a story in my eyes
Turn the pages of desire
Now it's time to trade those dreams
For the rush of passion's fire
I can feel you tremble when we touch
And I feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us
I've been holding back the night
I've been searching for a clue from you
I'm gonna try with all my might
To make this story line come true
Can ya feel me tremble when we touch
Can ya feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us
This love affair can't wait

I can't hold back, I'm on the edge
(I can't hold back)
You voice explodes inside my head
I can't hold back, I won't back down
Girl it's too late to turn back now

Another shooting star goes by
And in the night the silence speaks to you and I
And now the time has come at last
Don't let the moment run too fast

And I feel the hand of fate reaching out to both of us

For one moment, now you're all I know that I need

Just when I thought you were there to depend on
Don't you know that I've tried everything I know to do
I would lie or die for you - I just want to know why, 'cause

I've got a lot to learn about love, oh yeah
The only girl I care about is gone, she's gone, teach me about love

And now, now that you're gone, I'm here with my emotions and now I'm alone

Jim Peterik,"How can I convince you what you see is real
Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Can we last forever, will we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, these questions of the heart
You followed me through changes, and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses, through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me loves that I have lost

Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally stuck like lightning from the blue
Every highway leading me back to you
Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain the man I really am

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,

Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

The more I see you as years go by

From a place I rode my pony through the drove
Where the oak and blackjack trees kiss the playful prairie breeze

I used to play till evenin' shadows come
Then windin' down that old familiar pathway
I'd hear my mother call at set of sun

Come home, come home it's supper time
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home it's supper time
We're going home at last

Some of the fondest memories of my childhood
Were woven around supper time
When my mother used to call
From the backsteps of the old homeplace
""Come on home now son, it's supper time""

Ah, but I'd love to hear that once more
But you know for me time has woven the realization of
The truth that's even more thrilling and that's when
The call come up from the portals of glory
To come home, for it's supper time

When all of God's children
Shall gather around the table
Of the Lord himself
And the greatest supper time of them all

Come home, come home, it's supper time
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home, it's supper time

Guess I'm always sentimental 'round this time
Pardon me if a tear falls among my Christmas cheer

You know, I don't know why I get to feeling sentimental
About this time, every year
But every time I see a Christmas card
I somehow can't help reminiscing

About the very first Christmas that you and I spent together
What a beautiful Christmas card you gave me that year
Why I know you must have looked through thousands of cards
To find that wonderful poem that still brings a tear to my eyes

With her dark and sparkling eyes

There with a beautiful lady 
That I'll love the day that I die

Her parents were rich Estenaciaros 
And I was just one of the hands
Who hearded their ten thousand cattle
On their ten thousand acres of land
But I was a very poor cowboy 
And we lived in worlds far apart
So how could I tell her I loved her 
Or speak of the love in my heart

The lady I loved never loved me 
The lady I loved never knew
The day that she married another 
A poor cowboy's heart broke in two
And I know that she'll never miss me 
Or notice that I'm even gone
The cowboy who saddled her pony 
Now rides through the dark night alone

Jim Reeves,"There's a new moon over my shoulder
And an old love still in my heart

I remember now that I'm older
What you told me the day we had to part
You promised with the new moon
You'd be coming back to me

Many moons have passed
Still I'm waiting patiently

There's a new moon over my shoulder
And an old love still in my heart

There's a new moon over my shoulder
And an old love still in my heart

Now I'm wishing I had been bolder
Then perhaps we wouldn't be so far apart
You promised you would write me
But so could not a line

Still I wait and make believe
That some day you'll be mine

And an old love still in my heart

Jim Reeves,"I know that I'm a fool
To keep on loving you so hopelessly
Someone else is in your heart
So what's in it for me?

Why do I dream of you
When I'm just dreaming of what used to be
There's no future in the past
So what's in it for me?

But I can't help it
I can't seem to break the ties that bind
These ties of love are wound too tight
Around this heart of mine

I know that it's a sin
To wish my life could end and cease to be
But what's life without your love
What's in it for me?

But what's life without your love
What's in it for me?

A little bit of heaven they call Ireland where an angel waits for me

Jim Reeves,"When you were a little girl
And lived across the street 
We would walk to the candy store
And I would always treat
Little big-hearted candy boy
The candy man would say
When I bought you candy bars
To steal your heart away

Just a nickel piece of candy
Used to make your dreams come true
You'd hold my hand and tell me
Someday I'll love you

Through the years of growing up
I thought your love grew too
'Til your heart longed for the things
I couldn't buy for you
Slowly I could feel your love
Begin to fade and die
Then you found another
Much wealthier than I

Just a nickel piece of candy
Used to make your dreams come true
You'd hold my hand and tell me
Someday I'll love you

Little girl with golden curls
And eyes for diamond rings
You grew up and soon forgot
So many simple things
But I wonder if you're happy now
'Cause when you pass me by
I think I see a teardrop
In the corner of your eye

Jim Reeves,"Somewhere along the line I lost my love for you
I can't explain just why I feel the way I do
I only want to know what made my love grow cold
What made me change my mind somewhere along the line
The happiness I've known no longer lives with me
I hold a passion more the yearning to be free
Whatever caused the change has left this mark so strange
My eyes for love went blind somewhere along the line
Well it might have been the night you tossed your wedding rings away
And it could have been the many little things I meant to say
A mystery I know I can't define for I lost my love for you somewhere along the line

Each time you foul and then step out on me

I missed the sweet kiss that was mine for so long
Were you happy with new arms wrapped around you so tight?

Like a different car parked in your drive for a change?
Did they watch as he kissed you beneath the porch light?

He's got more fun than anybody's had
Don't got no worry, don't got no dough

Leads all the women around on a string
When they go out they get a million thrills

Sun shining down on Mexican Joe

He makes the night spots all along the bay
People want to see him when he comes their way
He spreads so much joy everywhere
He goes everyone shouts Viva la Mexican Joe

He likes to gamble at poker, he's an ace
He's always lucky with the cards at ever face
At winnin' the money, he is sure a whiz
But when they win they don't collect
'Cause they don't know where he is

Dancin', romancin', always on the go

He don't got no income tax 'cause he don't got no dough
Still he gets along just fine how we'll never know
He's got everything he wants, a girl, a song
If we use his formula we surely can't go wrong

His favorite playground is anywhere there's girls
He's got that something that sets their hearts a whirl
It couldn't be his money 'cause he ain't got a peso
But when he wants a kiss all he's got to do is say so

You've been acting funny for so long
It hurts to think that you think you're above me

Maybe they will help speed up time's crazy crawl
Might as well go around and join the winos ain't it funny how pride goes before a fall
Yes pride goes before a fall I've got a feeling

That I'm gonna seek much more than them all
When we first met I lived way above the city
Ain't it funny how pride goes before a fall

Dance with every Sue and Betty that's around
Take her out and try your luck that's what's expected

Jim Reeves,"That kiss you gave me this morning was just the calm before the storm
I know in my heart that you're leaving me for someone else's own
The storm sometimes comes without warning so I'm thankful that I was forewarned
It gives me a chance to speak to my heart and to brace myself for the storm

The storm is coming I can feel it and soon we'll be driven apart
You'll rush to the arms of your new love deserting a broken heart

Just once more before I leave town

I might do something I'd be sorry for later
So I won't come in while he's there
Does he know my whole world is in there with him

Two hearts lie in shambles and oh how they've cried

Somehow the dreams we planned have gone astray

And when he finds that she is gone
I guess I'll hear him sing this song

Home, where the trees grow tall

My eyes would get big, and his chest would swell

In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden there lived whom you may know

And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me
I was a child and she was a child
In this kingdom by the sea

But we loved with a love that was more than love
I and my Annabel Lee
With a love that the winged seraphs of Heaven
Coveted her and me

And this was the reason that long ago
In this kingdom by the sea
A wind blew out of a cloud chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee

So that her high-born kinsmen came
And bore her away from me
To shut her up in a sepulcher
In this kingdom by the sea

The angels not half so happy in heaven
Went envying her and me
Yes, that was the reason as all men know
In this kingdom by the sea

That the wind came out of the cloud by night
Chilling and killing my beautiful Annabel Lee
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we
Of many who were wiser than we

And neither the angels in heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul
From the soul of the beautiful Annabel Lee

For the moon never beams without bringing me
Dreams of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee

I can't resist these silly things
I do can't rule my heart anymore
If I can't hold your hand in mine once again
And have those goodnight kisses we shared at your door

Wishing love could be renewed
If I must be tortured by days gone by

Jim Reeves,"Alone and so lonesome bored and so blue
I got the urge to ramble so I took a drink or two
It tempted me to trifle then my true heart went astray
So I wandered in dark water and just threw my life away
I know that it was wrong to fool around this way so long
Someone was sawing on the limb that I was sittin' on
I looked down and I found I could drown in deep dark water
So I cried when I realized I couldn't swim
A fool and his money calls for whiskey and for gin
Filled to the gills and falling for the weaknesses as a man
From one fool to another wrong is never right
I ignored advice from mother and brother look at me tonight
Unsteady as I go with deep dark water down below
They keep sawing louder on my limb and soon I'll have to go
Life's been small hear my call as I fall in deep dark water
Don't be a would-be king and tumble from your throne",Deep Dark Water

There was laughter in your voice a smile upon your face

I don't believe what my friends told me I can't believe that you would be untrue
I know your heart beats for me and no other still I wonder darling did you

Did you return to the arms that held you tightly
To the lips that whispered words untrue
I love you too much to believe a careless rumor still I wonder darling did you",Did You Darling

Jim Reeves,"While resting the other evening by the side of the road
I saw an old farmer in the field that he just hold
His face was all brown and wrinkled from the sun and the wind
And he was talking to the Lord just like he'd be talking to a friend

Well sir he said with his voice calm and quiet
Them corn tassels need suckin' I got no strength to tie it
Had no rain in so long that the fields are mighty dusty
And it's been so unbearable hot that the kids were even gettin' fussy

Now that grass down and the pasture it should be knee high
If we could just have a little shower Lord it might keep the calf from going dry
Oh but listen to me talking you'd think I wasn't grateful
Why if you didn't know me so well Lord you'd think I was down right hateful

You'd think I forgot about that new calf that you sent
And the money in the mail that took care of the rent
Mama's cough's better and Johnny's home from the navy
And that good Sunday dinner of hot chicken and dumplings and gravy

And that new preacher you sent us Lord he's sure a fine young man
Why he's just convertin' them sinners to beat the bad
Well guess I'll mosey on home now Lord I won't take no more your time
Guess there's plenty folks here about waitin' to ring your line

Evening to you Lord and watch us over tonight
And don't you worry about us now Lord cause everything is gonna be all right",The Farmer and the Lord
Jim Reeves,"As I write this letter to you darlin'
I can't hold the teardrops from my eyes
For at sundown I will lay a-dyin'
At the door of the Fool's Paradise

Rode into this cattle town this mornin'
Left my burro to check the market price
And I walked into the nearest barroom
They call it the Fool's Paradise

There the crowd was gay and girls were dancin'
And the men were playin' cards and dice
So I stepped up to the bar to join them
What a grand place this Fool's Paradise

It was then I showed to them your picture
I passed it around once or twice
Then a man insulted your sweet honour
At the bar of the Fool's Paradise

So I slapped his face and I told him, I says
""You eat them words Mister, or draw, that's my advice""
And he said, ""Well, somebody might get hurt inside
But I'll be glad to meet you in the street at sundown
At sundown in front of the Fool's Paradise""

Jim Reeves,"This is the story of love that came undone
This is the story of two men
And a gun of two men and a gun

A man that I'd never met stole my wife and son
But that's been nearly three years now
And it's over with and done

At first I'd stare out into space
While hate consumed my soul
Hate was the creed by which I lived
And revenge my only goal

But the road to happiness isn't paved with hate
I'm glad I learned how to forgive before it was too late

Now here's the way the other man
Paid for what he'd done
I heard it from the man's own lips
Who took my wife and son

I didn't really know this man but I'd seen him 'round
He's a new guard at the factory
Where I work, west of town

This fellow swung into step with me and said I've got to talk
I listened spellbound at his words
As we stood on the walk

You, the guard said hoarsely
Are a kind man, I surmise
As he stood there with his handkerchief
Wiping in his eyes

Three years ago I wronged a man
I stole his wife and son
I didn't realize then the terrible thing that I had done

This thing gets hold of me at night
And I can't sleep or rest
Forgive me, sir, but telling it
Seems to get it off my chest

When my past looms up like this
It kinda helps me to unload
I'm one man, sir, who knows for sure
That you reap just what you sow

I sure appreciate your listening, it helps me a lot
You know to have that man's forgiveness
I'd give everything I've got

Well, I feel much better now I, I didn't get your name
More why that was my wife's name before we wed
It's odd your name's the same

You know I'd kill a man
Who'd do to me the thing that I've done
And when the truth got through to him
He handed me his gun

As I gave the weapon back
I said what's done is done
All I ask is just be kind to Jenny and my son

",The Gun
Jim Reeves,"Oh, Gypsy heart when you hear the whistle of a train
You forget the promise that you made down in lover's lane
You forget the kisses warm
The way you held her in your arms
You forget the way you thrilled her heart with all your gypsy charms.

Oh - oh - ohhhhhhhhhhh
Hear the whistle blow
Oh - oh - ohhhhhhhhhhh
Away, away you go
Gypsy heart you want love but not the settled kind
You'll be the death of love for me oh gypsy heart of mine.

I met a girl Birmingham with eyes so big and blue
I loved her since she said I cannot roam my dear with you
She said I want a little home
A heart to love and not roam
I'm sure someday you'll find your own a gypsy heart like you.

Oh - oh - ohhhhhhhhhhh
Hear the whistle blow
Oh - oh - ohhhhhhhhhhh
Away, away you go
Up till now the girls you've loved have all been very smart
They know even the change of love can't bind your gypsy heart.

Gypsy heart the wind that blows so far across the sea
Most of you will come along there's pretty things to see
In Ireland there are fair colleens
And songs of long ago
And the lovely ladies down in Spain oh gypsy heart let's go.

Oh - oh - ohhhhhhhhhhh
Hear the whistle blow
Oh - oh - ohhhhhhhhhhh
Away, away you go
You've been doin' everything since Noah sailed his ark
So let's keep rolling 'til we find another gypsy heart.

The couples were happy as they swayed to and fro
But my heart was heavy with love I had lost
As we danced to the hillbilly waltz

Tells a story of love that was false
I'll always remember as long as I live

The girl in my arms seemed so happy and gay
But she knew I was dreaming of my yesterday
Hoping that somewhere our pathway would cross

I'm waiting for ships that never come in.
I wonder where they can be?

Life is only a game of poker
And happiness is the partner
They deal you five cards in the cradle
And you play wether your like it or not.

Some get a pat hand to start with
And the game doesn't seem on the square
When you look at your hand and discover
You were born without even a pair.

But there's no use in kicking or squawking
Just pick up your cards and begin
To figure and plan and puzzle
While fate looks on with a grin.

Some take a chance at bluffing
And stake everything they've got
On a little dinky little poor flush
And sometimes that wins a plot.

Others will break up openers
To draw for a middle straight
They know what a chance they're takin'
And they learned their mistake, too late.

Some can't play crooked
Against all good advice
But they seldom get away with it
And in the end they've paid the price.

The most of us play straight poker
But I'll tell you boys it's hard
When you're there with both ends open
And you can't draw the winning card

Now, I've always been a loser
It seems that I never can win
And I'm just a dreamer who's waiting
For ships that never come in.

You have no right to be the judge to criticize and condemn
Just think but for grace of God it would be you instead of him
One careless step a thoughtless deed and then the mystery starts
And to those who weep death comes cheap these men with broken hearts
Oh so humble you should be if they come passing by
For it's written that the greatest men never get too big to cry
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts
And with hope all gone they walk alone these men with broken hearts
You've never walked in that man's shoes or seen things through his eyes
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies
Some were beggers some were kings and some were masters of the arts

Tige now I miss you you were my best friend)
Three years of Army Service done and I was headin' home at last
I got to thinking bout my dog and things long gone and passed
How old Tige pulled me from the creek when I had no pulse or breath
How he saved me from the chargin' bull that gored my Dad to death
As a kid I'd dream of bears and tremble to my toes
Till old Tige come up to my bed and nudge me with his nose
Then my fears would melt away and Tige would go lie down
I'd drift on back to sleep without another sound
The big bus stopped I got off it was awful dark and thick with fog
Then something gently nuzzled me and there stood Tige my dog
I wondered if my faithful dog had met the bus each day
And all the dreary winter nights since I'd been away
Have Tige meet me here like this I was I was really glad
Cause I hadn't needed Tige so much since the day they'd burried Dad
Two long miles still lay ahead but what I didn't know
A giant Dam was being built where the old road used to go
I thank the Lord for sending Tige and I followed where he led
Knowing well without his help that I'd be good as dead
Tige inched along this way and that going rough and slow
And I could hear the water lappin' at the ledges far below
Then through the mist I saw a light and mother in her chair
And I reached down to pet old Tige but he wasn't there
I'm thankful Mom you had old Tige these three lonely years
I owe my life to him tonight I couldn't help my tears
You say you wrote me bout the Dam well God was sure with us

Jim Reeves,"You say to send your letters back
To find and enclose my ring
You want a clean break with the past
But that won't change a thing

I know your letters all by heart
I read them everyday
They seem as easy to erase
As words are to unsay

Oh, send me back my lovers moon
And stars that shine above
Send me back, please, send me back
Send me back my love

Oh yes, I'll send your picture back
You mentioned up above
But there's no way I can send back
The magic of your love

Would I enclose the color film
Or just tear it apart
But your letter don't say what to do
With the pictures in my heart

How can I send back our dreams
Our kisses warm and real
The times I've held you in my arms
The way it made me feel

I can't send the love waves back
That fills my soul with bliss
Or send back the way I'm longing for
Just one more sweet kiss

Oh, send me back my lovers moon
And stars that shine above
Send me back, please, send me back

Jim Reeves,"Seven days can be a long long time my friend
When you dream about the cold black chair with straps for both your hands
If you wonder what it's like to know your life will soon be gone
Your thoughts are mostly bout the things you wish you'd never done

Your face is there in the darkest night so clear upon my wall
Yet soon I know I'm to face the darkest night of all
For on my head they'll place the thing that brings eternal peace
Then death will be the way to make this ache inside me cease
A stolen kiss a warm embrace a secret rendezvous

They didn't seem so wrong that night when first I met you
Then there he was insane with rage to see you held so tight
I didn't mean to kill him when we had that awful fight
Seven days I've sat here thinking bout our sin
Seven days to realize the trouble that I'm in

Seven days to weigh the price the man will make me pay
Seven days to think bout the night you ran away
Then you were gone and he lay dead a smile upon his lips
He knew this was the last time you'd give him the slip

Knew too the price for stolen love was just too much to pay
Perhaps I too can smile like him when my life ebbs away
He's coming out to lead me on to that little cell-like room
I fancy your face is smiling as we walk through the gloom
Perhaps you've found another who wants a rendezvous

But I'll I'll bet he can't imagine the price of loving you

Sometimes the name you whisper isn't mine
I've tried not to believe it but in my heart I know

I saw a young cowboy all dressed in white linen
Dressed in white linen as cold as the clay
So beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
Play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the green valley they'll lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong
Once in a saddle I used to go dashing once in a saddle I used to go gay
First to the courthouse and lay down the roses
But I'm shot in the breast and I'm dyin' today

Jim Reeves,"Too many parties and too many pals
Will break your heart someday
Too many boyfriends and sociable sals
May drive your sweetheart away

Gentlemen of the jury
The judge's speech began
The scene was a crowded courtroom
And the judge a stern old man

This prisoner here before you
Is a social enemy
A lady of the evening
And you know the penalty

Her eyes reflect the nightlife
Her cheeks they're red with paint
But I knew her mother, gentlemen
Why her mother was a saint

Now I know that she's not like her
And yet she might have been
If it hadn't been for pettin' parties cigarettes and gin
We took the night life off the streets
And brought it in our own homes

While girls beguiled with lipstick
Danced to saxophones
We opened up the underworld
To the ones we loved so well

So tell me gentlemen is it right
To send her to a cell?
If she drinks while you taught her
And if she smokes you showed her how

So gentlemen do you think it's right
To condemn her now
And when you're in that jury room
Just remember there and then

That for every fallen woman
There's a hundred fallen men
And before you render a verdict
On what this girl has done

Just remember there's a man to blame
And that man might be your son
Now gentlemen that's my story
My testimony stands

This girl is my own daughter
And the case is in your hands
Those Broadway roses and prevalent
Sounds at too many parties and too many pals

They make me realize
Darling that you don't want me
Guess you've been telling me lies

I have no love at all no peace of mind

Jim Reeves,"It was a stylish congregation you could see they'd been around
And they had the biggest pipe organ of any church in town
But over in the Amen Corner of that church sat Brother Ayer
And he insisted every Sunday on singing in the choir
His voice was cracked and broken age had touched his vocal chords
And nearly every Sunday he'd get behind and miss the words
Well the choir got so flustered the church was told in fine
That Brother Ayer must stop his singing or the choir was going to resign
So the pastor appointed a committee I think it was three or four
And they got in their big fine cars and drove up to Ayer's door
They find the choir's great trouble sittin' there in an old arm chair
And the summer's golden sunbeams lay upon his snow white hair
Said York we're here dear Brother with the vestries approbation
To discuss a little matter that affects the congregation
Now it seems that your voice has interfered with the choir
So if you'll just lay out are you listening Brother Ayer
The old man raised his head a sign that he had hear
And on his cheek the three men caught the glitter of a tear
His feeble hands pushed back the locks as white as silky snow
And he answered the committee in a voice both soft and low
I wonder if beyond the tide that's breaking at my feet
In that far off heavenly temple where my Master and I shall meet
Yes I wonder if when I try to sing the song of God up higher
I wonder if they'll kick me out of there for singing in heaven's choir
A silence filled the little room and the old man bowed his head
The committee went on back to town but Brother Ayer was dead
The choir missed him for awhile but he was soon forgotten
A few church goers watched the door but the old man entered not
Far away his voice is sweet and he sings his heart desire
Where are there no church committees and no fashionable choirs

Which can't feel good 'cause of feeling low
I don't worry if I'm broke no more
I ain't rich so I must be poor

Makes no difference if they're right or wrong

To ride around and they puff cigars
Give me a rattle trap model T

The house grows cold and steps on a flea
The flea yells fellas there's a house on me

I love you not only for what you've made of yourself
But for what you're making of me
I love you for ignoring the possibilities of the fool in me
And for laying firm hold of the possibilities for good in me
Why do I love you I love you for closing your eyes to the dischords
And for adding to the music in me by worshipful listening
I love you because you're helping to make of the lumber of my life
Not a tavern but a temple
And out of the words of my everyday not a reproach but a song
I love you because you have done more than any creed to make me happy
You have done it without a word without a touch without a sign
You have done it just by being yourself and after all perhaps that's what love means",Why Do I Love You?

Is it lost forever, will it live again someday?
How can a broken heart live on with more than its share?
When it knows the game is lost and it's hopeless to care
When a heart has taken 'bout all it can stand

Is it then protected with God's loving hand?
Where does a broken heart go when it dies of pain?
Is there a heaven for broken hearts, will it live again?

I'll cease this wild weeping, drive sorrow away.

That his name made me tremble and my pale cheeks to glow.

I'll charm every heart and the crowd I will sway.

When he won, then neglected the frail wildwood flower.

He told me he loved me and promised to love
Through I'll and misfortune all others above.
Another has won him, ah misery to tell
He left me in silence, no word of farewell.

It's the end of the 70's
It's the end of the century

Do you remember lying in bed
With your covers pulled up over your head?
Radio playin' so no one can see
We need change, we need it fast
Before rock's just part of the past
'Cause lately it all sounds the same to me
Oh, oh

Jim Rome,"Up all night
Ooh za za
Ooh staying up all night

African jungle
Big city street
The only real difference is in
The people you meet

Up all night
Ooh za za
Ooh staying up all night

It's an agreeable town
It's neat and sedate
Why even the muggers are off
The streets by eight

Up all night
Ooh za za
Ooh staying up all night
Say it ain't so Joe, say it ain't so Joe

Polite and well spoken
Well heeded and well sane
They know they're alive
When they start to feel pain

You're staying up all night
Ooh za za
Ooh staying up all night

Ooh staying up all night
Say it ain't so Joe, say it ain't so Joe

Jim Rome,"Welcome to the jungle we've got fun and games
We got everything you want honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find whatever you may need
If you got the money honey we got your disease

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knnn knne knees, knees
I want to watch you bleed

Welcome to the jungle we take it day by day
If you want it you're gonna bleed but it's the price to pay
And you're a very sexy girl that's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights but you won't get there for free
In the jungle welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine
Ooh, I want to hear you scream

Welcome to the jungle it gets worse here every day
Ya learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play
If you hunger for what you see you'll take it eventually
You can have everything you want but you better not take it from me

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knnn knne knees, knees
I want to watch you bleed

And when you're high you never ever want to come down
So down, so down, so down, yeah

You know where you are?
You're down in the jungle baby, you're gonna dieee

Watch it bring you to your knees, knees

Out where there's a hillside of heather curtseyin' gently in the breeze
That's what I'd like to do; see the heather but with you.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder,there's lazy music in the rill,
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.
There may be other days as rich and rare,
There may be other springs as full and fare,
But the won't be the same, they'll come and go
For this I know;
That when the mist is in gloamin'
And all the clouds are holdin' still,
If you're not there I won't go roamin' through the heather on the hill,

Jim Self,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet

Jim Self,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?

And to think that
You are mine alone.

Where god paints the scenery

I'll search for wood,
So you can cook... while i stand look-in'

Are we a pair?

Jim Snidero,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free

Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping

Lies a sleepy little Okeechobee town
Talk of swamp witch Hattie lock you in when the sun go down
Rumors of what she'd done, rumors of what she'd do
Kept folks off the track of Hattie's shack
In the back of the Black Bayou

One day brought the rain and the rain stayed on
And the swamp water overflowed
Skeeters and the fever grabbed the town like a fist
Doctor Jackson was the first to go
Some say the plague was brought by Hattie
There was talk of a hangin' too 
But the talk got shackled by the howls and the cackles
From the bowels of the Black bayou

Early one morn 'tween dark and dawn when shadows filled the sky
There came an unseen caller on a town where hope run dry
In the square there was found a big black round 
Vat full of gurgling brew

Whispering sounds as the folk gathered round
""It came from the Black Bayou""
There ain't much pride when you're trapped inside
A slowly sinkin' ship
Scooped up the liquid deep and green
And the whole town took a sip
Fever went away and the very next day the skies again were blue
Let's thank old Hattie for savin' our town
We'll fetch her from the Black Bayou

Party of ten of the town's best men headed for Hattie's Shack
Said Swamp Witch magic was useful and good
And they're gonna bring Hattie back
Never found Hattie and they never found the shack
Never made the trip back in
There was a parchment note they found tacked to a stump 
Said don't come lookin' again.",Swamp Witch

Jim Steinman,"Hey! Listen now it's coming so close
I'll let the rhythm surround me
I'm getting itchy and I'm ready to move
I'm mighty glad that you found me
There's a drummer going at it way down in the core of my soul
There's no escaping the music and I'm psyching up my feet
And they're telling me we're ready to roll

There are times when I can fight it but now's the time I want to give in
Sooner or later we'll get around to love
But now's the time to shake it
Oh Baby let the party begin
Baby let the party begin

When I woke up this morning and I looked out my window
I could see the sky was cloudy and gray
There was a chill in the air and a pain in my heart
And the thunder it was coming my way

Oh, it was looking pretty bad and I was so alone
And there was any place to go
But now I'm out of the blue, I know what I got to do
And something in me's starting to grow
I can feel it in me starting to grow...grow...grow...grow...

I got dance in my pants
Every time I feel the power in a radio wave
I turn it up all the way
I got dance in my pants
Every time I see the glory of a good-looking face
Well I just got to say:""Hey now, don't you worry baby, everything'll be fine
We got nothing but the best and we got nothing but time
And there'll always be a time when they'll be waiting in line

I remember everything!
I remember every little thing as if it happened only yesterday
I was barely seventeen, and I once killed a boy with a Fender guitar
I don't remember if it was a telecaster or a stradacaster
But I do remember that it had a heart of chrome and a voice like a horny angel
I don't remember if it was a telecaster or a stradacaster
But I do remember that it wasn't at all easy
It required the perfect combination of the right power chords
And the precise angle from which to strike
The guitar bled for about a week afterward
And the blood was ugh dark and rich, like wild berries
The blood of the guitar was Chuck Berry red
The guitar bled for about a week afterward, but it rung out beautifully
And I was able to play notes that I had never even heard before
So I took my guitar, and I smashed it against the wall
I smashed it against the floor
I smashed it against the body of a varsity cheerleader
Smashed it against the hood of a car
Smashed it against a 1981 Harley Davidson
The Harley howled in pain, the guitar howled in heat
And I ran up the stairs to my parents' bedroom
Mummy and daddy were sleeping in the moonlight
Slowly I opened the door, creeping in the shadows
Right upto the foot of their bed
I raised the guitar high above my head
And just as I was about to bring the guitar crashing down
 upon the centre of the bed, my father woke up, screaming ""Stop!""
""Wait a minute! Stop it boy! What do ya think you're doin'?
That's no way to treat an expensive musical instrument!""
And I said: ""God dammit daddy!
You know I love you, but you got a hell of a lot to learn about rock an' roll""",Love and Death and an American Guitar

And you were looking so restless and reckless and lost

Jim White,"Well I was shacked up down in Mobile 
With a girl from New York City.
She woke me up one night to tell me 
That we weren't alone.
She said she saw the ghost 
Of a woman staring at me.
I told her not to worry, 
But in the morning when I woke up, she was gone.

So I headed on to Florida where 
I tangled with some sailors.
And as I lay bloody on the wharf, 
I cursed the ship they sailed on.
Wouldn't you know, twenty four hours later 
That ship sank into the ocean
Disappearing like an unwanted memory 
Beneath the waves.

I guess it's 'cause, still waters run, 
Run deep in me
'Cause I got this crazy way
Crazy way I'm swimming in still waters.

And I was woke up just before dawn 
By an old man crying in the rain.
He was drunk and he was lonely 
And as he passed by he sang a hymn.
And as I lay there listening, 
Well I almost joined him in that song
But instead I just held my peace, 
And waited 'till that old man moved along.

Then later on that day about 
A quarter mile out of town,
I found his body hanging in 
A grove of pines, swaying in the wind.
And as he swang that rope sang another hymn 
To Jesus,
And this time though I don't know why, 
I somehow felt inclined to sing along.

I guess it's cause, still waters run, 
Run deep in me
'Cause I got this crazy way
crazy way I'm swimming in still waters.

Yes and there are projects for the dead 
And there are projects for the living
Thought I must confess sometimes 
I get confused by that distinction
And I just throw myself into the arms 
Of that which would betray me.
I guess to see how far Providence 
Will stoop down just to save me.

And it's all because, still waters run, 
Run deep in me

Now, 24/7 in the end my friend, gotta go at God's speed, no never relent, lest the soul-sucking, sneaky-deaky, belly-aching past like a ssssnake in the grasssssssss ssssstrike and bury your assssssss. So keep your eyes on the prize on the distant horizon. Be wary of the wind and the bad moon rising. Knowing in your going, somehow, some way, that you'll out-run your shadow...yes you will, one fine day. 'Cause you're traveling faster than the speed of regret. What I was born knowing I was bound to forget. In the blindness of being what I was born seeing I was just plain bound to forget, yes I was just plain bound to forget.



",Bound to Forget
Jim White,"Where in the world did you come from my dear? 
Did some mysterious voice tell you I'd still be here? 
I bought this ticket to Mobile, but I been stranded all day
P.a. said the bus broke down ten miles away from the station.

[Chorus]
So seldom a door, so seldom a key, so seldom a hit like the hurt you put on me. 
But seldom comes happiness without the pain of the devil in the details 
Since I saw the smile on your face 
As I was crying in a Greyhound station on Christmas Day, in 1998. 

The burden of love is the fuel of bad grammar. 
You stutter and stammer--what a bitch to convey the crux of the matter, 
When the words you must utter are hopelessly tangled 
In the memories and scars you show no one. 

[Chorus]

I remember quite clearly, a bad Muzak version of James Taylor's big hit, 
Called ""Fire and Rain"" was playing as you crouched down and tearfully kissed me, 
And I thought, ""Damn, what good fiction I will mold from this terrible pain."" 

[Chorus]

Amazing grace, how sweet the smile upon the face I never thought I'd see you again
Especially here in this Greyhound station
On Christmas Day
In 1998.",Christmas Day

To the ghosts dancing in the breeze?
Blowing through my mind.
Got a Corvair in my yard. 
It hasn't run in fifteen years.
It's a home for the birds now. 
It's no longer a car.
Last night I dreamed that I was swimming in a sea.
Like always, with everything I went in too deep.
Got a Corvair in my yard. 
It hasn't run in fifteen years.
It's a home for the birds now.

Kick the rusted scrap-iron of my memories and dreams. 
Yeah, here's a busted compass...look, the needle's standing still.
Much as some folks hate to lose their way, me, I pray to God that I will. 
I got a confession; I never ever had no appetite for pain.
So it's a mystery to me why I like walking in the ghost-town...ghost-town of my brain.
I'm on a coal train headed south, guess we're bound for Birmingham.
Thick as thieves with a black girl twice as messed-up as I am.
The smile upon her face betrays the sorrow in her heart.
Like the testimony of a fun house mirror that some fool broke apart.

Girl listen here; you're just a leaf caught in God's secret hurricane.
And on this cold and dark wild midnight you are dancing in the ghost-town...ghost-town of my brain.
Feel them magnets in the shadows?
Hear the voice of tranger virtue?
Take no comforts with them specters 'cause you know that they can hurt you.
Sweet mother load of secrets, feed my wild and endless hunger.
Seek the misty trail beyond the veil where the world gets torn asunder.
Gimme needles in the haystacks, Lord and riddles in the rain...

If it was God that saved the miracle child from the peril of the fiery flame,
Well then it musta been him that killed the two hundred others just to glorify
His name

My girlfriend blows a boozy good-bye kiss.
I see flying squirrels and nightmares of stigmata.
Then awakening to find my Trans-Am gone.
Still, I'm feeling pretty good about the future.
Yeah, everything is peaches but the cream.
I'm handcuffed to a fence in Mississippi,
Where things is always better than they seem.
Things is always better than they seem.
I see the guitar that my cousin played in prison,
Floating with the tv in the swimming pool.
I'm calling for the owner of the motel,
Then noticing the bloodstain on the door.
I'm reaching for the shoes under the bushes,
Just in time to hear the sirens sing.
I'm handcuffed to a fence in Mississippi,
Where things is always better than they seem.
Things is always better than they seem.
You know freedom's just a stupid superstition,
'cause life's a highway that you travel blind.
It's true that having fun's a terminal addiction.
What good is happiness, when it's just a state of mind?
For in the prison of perpetual emotion,
We're all shackled to the millstone of our dreams.

I hocked my tools...to buy my brain...a funeral wreath...from the FTD
Blank billboards on the highway of life. Counterfeit bills in the neon lights.
This stick-shift driven saw-dust dream, show-biz sho' ain't what it seems.
Little hipster dufus with the guitar in a coffin. I been copping his licks about every so often.
Then I flip-flop, go the other way...
I rip off the dude where the colored girls say; doo-doo-do-doo-doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-doooo-dooooo
See, I cut my teeth on the white lines of life's endless lonesome highways.
Taking stock in the horizon... shouting at every fool that come my way---

""HEY! Can you gimme a ride? Are you going my way?""
""HEY! Can you gimme a ride? Someone gimme a ride!""
But ain't no one going my way.
Now downtown they got the prison of shame.
See the castaways of the Hollywood game?
Tricked out whores with invisible pains.
Cardboard people, dancing in the rain...
To the same old tune, circling like a vulture with the busted juke-box of the popular culture.
If it ain't got a beat, they won't put you on the street.
Heavy on the bass, light on the feet.
I meet the street poets in the bummed out bars.
I hum my single as I jingle down the
""Walk Of Stars""
With the geeks and the freaks and the crooks and the hookers---
The burn-outs of life's pressure cookers.
Now, these are my people, my church without a steeple,
And though I never waste a tissue on an incidental issue,
Still I sympathize, 'cause I realize when I see the sorrow in their eyes.
'Cause I cut my teeth on the white lines of life's endless lonesome highways.

""HEY! Can you gimme a ride? Someone gimme a ride!""
But ain't no one going my way.
Now in the field of my mind
I'm plowing the topsoil of my memory.
Digging up bones and skeletones--- rusty relics from my past.
Gotta put a new shine on the twists of time, redefine this old cemetery...
Clear out the weeds, sow new seeds, sure I'm scared, but still I'm gonna carry on.
'Cause never did a body find their way home without showing first firm as a stone
The conviction, the strength the courage that it takes to make a journey start
For you got to be true, you got to be strong,
'specially when the long road home
Leads smack through the smoking ruins of your broken heart.And I know.

Sweetly do I whisper your name
Lonely solo taxi ride to a cheap motel

On the wrong side of the tracks
The facts are tricky to explain
Cold front bearing down
Blowing in from Birmingham

By dawn the window's wet with icy rain
Behind fourteen doors
A sad parade of paramours are throwing little
White rocks at sorrow's window pane
Me, I've found someone to love more than the rain

Salvation Army ringing bell
Kingdom come and wishing wells
Hey Santa Claus I see your junkie eyes
It's the devil and the deep blue sea with old friends

I hope I never see again all tangled up
With misery and lies
The lonely hiss of passing cars
Feeds the ache of ancient scars
Like ghosts beneath my bed rattling chains

No good luck charm or remedy ever
Proved to soothe my sanity
Nor bad medicine served to ease my pain
Had to find someone to love more than the rain

Now, old habits will die hard
This pile of junk setting in my yard
Souvenirs from the wrecking ball of dreams
You spend a lifetime tearing temples

Down, it gets to feel like
Hallowed ground is a shallow grave
Where ne'er the bluebird sings
Last time home when I played this song
You said, ""Dad, it's sad, and way too long""

And I pulled you close and held you in my arms
Yes, salvation wears a thin disguise

And I thank God them years

Take a soul where it wants to go

These dreams are familiar
These are places we've been before
Somewhere in the wild blue yonder
Lies a path where blindly we go

Jim White,"How we get lost
Going from here to there
Counting numbers in the air
Cheekbone to a cool stone wall

See the fireflies in this mason jar
Light my smile like a faded scar
We used to wonder who we are
These days we don't care

How we get lost, how we get lost
Going here to there
How we get lost, how we get lost
Counting numbers in the air

And at times
It seems like we've been here
Before but can't recall
The old familiar signs have disappeared

As in time we conjure from thin air
Maps we pray will carry us
Far away from fear
To some grace we engineer

How we get lost, how we get lost
Going here to there
How we get lost, how we get lost
Counting numbers in the air
Counting numbers in the air

Our life's a song like an old 45
Start to skip in the groove just to stay alive
But when you close your eyes what do you see?

Do stars align to light the way?
As the twilight fades to gray
Will you rise and shine away
Or will you simply one day disappear?
Or will you simply one day disappear?

How we get lost, how we get lost
Going here to there
How we get lost, how we get lost

Jim White,"It's the twilight hour
As the sun goes down
I see a flatbed Ford with a scrapyard load
Rattle off through town

The railroad crossing lights flash on
There ain't no train in sight
A crescent moon will soon ascend
As day gives way to night

And I feel home
And I think how far away
I got from home
Back in the bad old days
But I'm done turning diamonds to coal

Now just before dinner time
This old drunk comes knocking on my door
Say he's looking for some girl who lived here
Twenty-seven years ago

The radio in the kitchen is playing
'Papa Was A Rolling Stone'
And as he strolls away into the night
And the streetlights flicker on

I get to thinking about home
And how sometimes there come a day
When I try to get back home
But all you can do is run away
But I'm done turning diamonds to coal

In love we find out who we are
In sorrow we abide
Our strength's revealed by what we build
From the broken things inside

But a day will come when you will know
Which way you must choose to go
To travel on and live alone
Or turn yourself around and try to get back home
Try to get back home

And now way up high two jet planes
Weave spider webs across the sky
As that flatbed Ford has dropped his load
Now there he goes swinging by

And the silence gathering 'round this house
Makes such a lovely sound
That I know for sure that I am cured
From turning diamonds, from turning diamonds to coal

'Cause I feel home and I'm done turning diamonds to coal
Yes, I'm done turning diamonds to coal
Yes, I'm done turning diamonds to coal
Yes, I'm done turning diamonds to coal
Yes, I'm done turning diamonds to coal

Jim White,"That's how they found him
He was howling at the moon
He's sitting right there on the railway tracks
And the train was coming

There was a string of wild flowers
Draped around his collar
And when he saw the men were coming for him
Well, he began to holler

He cried, ""Take me away, take me away""
But the men could not be sure
If he was talking to them or talking to the oncoming train

Now his mama she watched religion on the TV
Each day from dawn to dusk
And at night when she'd hear him howling
Well, she'd cried to Jesus

For years she begged the Sweet Redeemer
To heal her crazy son
Until finally she just gave up on miracles
And called the men to come

She told them, ""Take him away, take my son away
'Cause after 20 long years
I've simply run out prayers to pray""

But as he stood to fight the men
From the other side of the railway bed
He thought he heard the calling voice
Of an old friend he thought long dead

But when he turned away from the men
He found it was a stranger calling him
And as if he knew that man
He smiled and raised his hand

As he stepped into the golden sun
Of the headlight of the oncoming train
And as he did he locked eyes with that stranger
He cried out one last time
He cried, ""Take me away, please, take me away""

And to this day in this little town
Not a soul knows what he was trying to say
All them years of shouting take me away
No, no one knows what he was trying to say
Or who that stranger was",Take Me Away

Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?

So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

And the day is, too
There's nothing left here to meet me
But the velvet moon
All my loneliness I have felt today
It's like a little more than enough
To make a man throw himself away

And I continue
To burn the midnight lamp
Alone

Now the smiling portrait of you
Is still hangin' on my frowning wall
It really doesn't, really doesn't bother me too much at all
It's just the ever falling dust
That makes it so hard for me to see
That forgotten earring layin' on the floor
Facing coldly towards the door

I continue
To burn the midnight lamp
Lord, alone

Loneliness is such a drag

So here I sit to face
That same old fire place
Gettin' ready for the same old explosion
Goin' through my mind
And soon enough time will tell,
About the circus in the wishing well
And someone who will buy and sell for me
Someone to toll my bell

And I continue

Jimi Hendrix,"Anger, he smiles,
Towering in shiny metallic purple armour
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground

Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted,
They quietly understand
Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready,
But wonder why the fight is on
But they're all bold as love, yeah, they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
Just ask the axis

My red is so confident that he flashes trophies of war,
And ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young, full of daring,
But very unsteady for the first go round
My yellow in this case is not so mellow
In fact I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from, eh,
Giving my life to a rainbow like you
But, I'm bold as love, yeah, I'm bold as love
Yeah, yeah
Well I'm bold, bold as love (hear me talking, girl)
I'm bold as love
Just ask the axis (he knows everything)

Suzy was in pig tails

My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her""
Yah! Hey, hey, hey

Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her

'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah!

Jimi Hendrix,"Anger, he smiles,
Towering in shiny metallic purple armour
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground

Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted,
They quietly understand
Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready,
But wonder why the fight is on
But they're all bold as love, yeah, they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
Just ask the axis

My red is so confident that he flashes trophies of war,
And ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young, full of daring,
But very unsteady for the first go round
My yellow in this case is not so mellow
In fact I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from, eh,
Giving my life to a rainbow like you
But, I'm bold as love, yeah, I'm bold as love
Yeah, yeah
Well I'm bold, bold as love (hear me talking, girl)

While I've got money to spend
Tomorrow might be Monday 
And I'd neither have a dollar nor a friend 
Well I've got plenty of money in my pocket
My good time friends are around 
But as soon as my pocketbook is empty
Not a friend on this earth can be found 
I wrote my little woman a letter good people
And I told her I was in jail
She sent me back an answer
Sayin honey I'm a coming go your bail
But I'm still walking round 
This old jail house this evening
Forty dollars won't pay my fine
Corn whiskey has surrounded my body poor boy
And my woman is troubling my mind
Lord my daddy told me a pretty good people
And my momma she told me more
Said son if you don't quit your rowdy ways
You'll have trouble at your door
If it wasn't for heartaches and trouble good people
Lord I would not be here today
I will ramble this whole world over
At home I cannot stay
Give me corn bread
On the table when I'm hungry
Something tall and cool when I'm dry
And a true loving woman to stand by me
Sweet heaven when I die
Go dig a hole in the meadow good people
Make it deep in that cold cold ground
Then gather around all you kind friends 
And see this poor rounder go down
And when I'm dead and they buried me
With my pale face turned to the sun
Will you stand around and moan little woman
And think of the way you have done

Seems our freedom's up
Against the ropes

Is it East versus West
Or man against man
Can any nation stand alone

An unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night

In the warrious code
There's no surrender
Though his body says stop
His spirit cries, never!
Deep in our soul

Know it's you against you
It's the paradox
That drives us on
It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack
It's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone

He brought no flowers
And she never asked him why
Although she shared his love of duty

He chased the wind in search of glory
She went beside him
Till he tried to reach the sky
Then she would wait to hear his story

And love was all that stayed between them
Music always played between them
Only gifts relate between them
But they could not see them for each other
Lovers for a sister and a brother

And then at last they found the real one
When she grew tired
He held her hand and made her strong
When a treasure is yours no need to steal one

And now the children are growing
She sometimes understands
The past can't last this long
The journey is worth the price of going

And love will always stay around them
Music always play around them
And the gifts that lay around them

Jimmie Dale Gilmore,"I was the one who taught her to kiss
The way that she kisses you now
And you know the way she touches your cheek
Well I taught her how

I was the one who taught her to cry
When she wants you under her spell
The sight of her tear drives you out of your mind
I taught her so well

And then one day I had my love
As perfect as could be
She lived, she loved, she laughed, she cried

And with your word unspoken
You made me whole and showed me how to fly

And I take all your troubles I can find

Now your tears come falling, just as pure as rain

I'm not even trying, it won't be the same

And I'll run from you, oh, in the morning time
I know you'll need me when the sun comes softly
You'll want me by your side

Baby Leonardo must have held his hammer heavy
As he cast a shadow, straight into stone
Maybe wisdom comes to those who wait though being weary
I know for myself though, I'll just walk on

And I'll run from you, oh, in the summertime
I know you'll need me when the warm breeze is blowing
You'll want me by your side

I have often thought you were all that I saw clearly
When babe like me, you were trying too hard to be free
Maybe now it's time for us to look where we have come
Though you think you're hiding form me
I'm not the one you're hiding from

And I'll run from you, oh, in the winter time
I know you'll need me when the snowflakes are flying
You'll want me by your side

I would wait for you, but my feet just keep on walking
And like a laughing stream my thoughts come quick, cool and clear
Something echoes now and then, but I don't hear
And on a winding road I'm well on my way with nothing to fear

And I'll run from you, oh, in the evening time
I know you'll need me when the moon is a burning
You'll want me by your side

On a hill where the wind only carried the sound

All the flowers were dancing
One by one they all told me of the time

And I was thinking about you

I walked on down by the river
Saw the sails on the ships that were leaving
For places I could only dream of

I walked through the market and stared 
at the harbor lights

And the one I left behind
To do this rambling 'round.
Tonight I'm drinking while I'm thinking
Until the beer joints close
And I'm thinking of someone
I called my Georgia Rose.

It's on dusty streets we walked
And talked of things to be
And she never laughed or mocked
My wanting to be free Tonight I'm free
To walk these streets
While the wind cuts through my clothes.
And I'm free to dream forever
About my Georgia Rose.

Blooming among the pines

And they lead his heart somewhere
Sometimes he follows certain voices
And he don't seem to care.

Down on the Eastern coast
And I love that pretty girl

Perhaps they're better left unsung

When there is no pebble tossed nor wind to blow

Reach out your hand if your cup be empty
If your cup is full, may it be again
Let it be known, there is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men

And there's a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night

That path is for your steps alone

Jimmie Dale Gilmore,"Did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night?
Well Dallas is a jewel, oh yeah, Dallas is a beautiful sight.
And Dallas is a jungle but Dallas gives a beautiful light.
Did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night?

Well, Dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you're down.
But when you are up, she's the kind you want to take around.
But Dallas ain't a woman to help you get your feet on the ground.
Yes Dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you're down.

Well, I came into Dallas with the bright lights on my mind,
But I came into Dallas with a Dollar and a dime.

Dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eye.
A steel and concrete soul with a warm hearted love disguise.
A rich man who tends to believe in his own lies.
Dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eyes.

Jimmie Dale Gilmore,"Well I'm your Ramblin' Man and I can lift your latch 
I could stay here, Mama, but I got me some trains to catch.

When that cold north wind stops blowing 
I'll still be walking the line 
You ever see me laughing little lady, 
I'm laughing just to keep from crying 
I'm your Ramblin' Man and some Christmas time 
Won't you hang my holy socks on a midnight line.

Well that mountainside's just gonna sit there 
That river's gonna rush on by. 
But don't ask me to hang around 
I couldn't stay here if I tried
I'm your Ramblin' Man and I can go where I choose 
And if you sing me a song, Mama, make it a midnight blues.

Well don't that moon look beautiful, Baby, 
Climbing up through the sky? 
Well it looks like I'm gonna chase that moon
Mama, 'til the day I die 
I'm your Ramblin' Man and there ain't no doubt 
I'm gonna hang out late, Mama, with the midnight crowd

Where the silver starlight glistens 
On the green mossy banks of time
I'm gonna spend my long nights listening 
And looking for a star that's mine 
I'm your Ramblin' Man, and 'til I come home 
Won't you hang my midnight mail on a rolling stone

Jimmie Dale Gilmore,"I'll look for you tonight out on that hardwood floor
I know I know you less and yet I need you more
I know I can't know what tomorrow holds in store
So I'll look for you tonight out on that hardwood floor

It's easy for a man to let his memories down
Sometimes he just holds on by letting go
But when he's caught between what he has lost and found
He's the first to feel like he's the last to know

I'll look for you tonight out on that hardwood floor
I know I know you less and yet I need you more
I know I can't know what tomorrow holds in store
So I'll look for you tonight out on that hardwood floor

In ribbons and reflections I have seen your face
In secret songs I've sung I've seen my own
But face to face, these disappear with out a trace
And set me free to dance with you alone

I'll look for you tonight out on that hardwood floor
I know I know you less and yet I need you more
I know I can't know what tomorrow holds in store
So I'll look for you tonight out on that hardwood floor

I'll look for you tonight

Jimmie Dale Gilmore,"My Grandpa farmed for a livin',
Content to live the simpler kind of life.
My Grandma worked in the kitchen,
Awfully proud to be that farmer's wife.
They used to say that they'd got everything that they need,
Each mornin' they wake up:
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.

Here I am, ring on my finger:
Grandpa's little grandson, all grown up.
I found my rock and I plan to keep her.
I wish they were here to see the two of us.
They'd proud to know we've got everything that we need,
Each mornin' we wake up:
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.

With the highway twice as wide,
And the farmland sub-divided.
It's good to know that some things never change.
I'm still lovin' an I'm still livin',
By those simple words of wisdom:
Life an' love come down to just four things.

My Grandpa, Lord knows, I miss him,
An' the way that he and Grandma looked at life.
And each day, I count my blessings,
To have that kind of love here by my side.
No matter what, we know we've got everything that we need,
Each mornin' we wake up:
Four walls, three words, two hearts, one love.

Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms

A paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Jimmie Noone,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

You're down and out, you say
At first I thought I would tell you
To travel on the other way

But in my memory lingers
All you once were to me
I'm going to give you another chance
To prove what you can be

Any old time you want to come back home
Drop me a line and say, no more you'll roam
You had your chance to play the game fair
And when you left me, sweetheart you only left a load of care

Now that you're down I'm going to stick by you
If you will only say your roaming days are through

You'll find me here like the day you left me alone
Any old time you wanna come back home

You'll find me right here like the day you left me alone

Kiss Susie Jane goodbye at the fountain
I'm going, said I, to the land of the sky
Away out on the mountain

Where the wild sheep grows and the buffalo lows
And the squirrels are so many you can't count them
Then I'll make love to some turtle dove
Way out on the mountain

When the north winds blow and we're gonna have snow
And the rain and the hail comes bouncing
I'll wrap myself in a grizzly bear coat
Away out on the mountain

Where the snakes are vile and the zebras? wild
And the beavers paddle on walking canes
Then I'll send my boots with a buffalo hide
Away out on the mountain

Where the whippoorwills sing me to sleep at night
And the eagle roosts on the rocks of spontan
I'll feast on the meat and the honey so sweet
Way out on the mountain

I've been from several places
And I'm going to be from here

Seems there's something missing
There's feelings in my breath

He's in the jailhouse now. 

He played a game called poker
He knuckled with Dan Yoakum
But shootin' dice was his greatest game
Now he's downtown in jail
Nobody to go his bail
The judge done said that he will pay the fine.

I went out last Tuesday
Met a girl named Susie
I told her I was the swellest man around
We started to spend my money
Then she started to call me honey
We took in every cabaret in town.

Jimmy Barnes,"Make sense of the world when it’s upside down
Spinning so fast, but for some it just ends
Keep moving on quiet as kept
It hasn’t been long, hasn’t sunken in yet

Then I fall into pieces
I’m here and you’ve left
Fall into pieces
I’ll never see you again
Separate like a puzzle floating in space
So lost in this galaxy of life
So lost

There’s so many things we haven’t said
There’s so many places never went
Wish you could visit every now and then
Oh I keep pretending like I understand
Was it something that I could prevent?
Oh I miss you like a piece is gone
So lost

Cause I fall into pieces
I’m here and you’ve left
Oh I fall into pieces
Never seeing you again
I separate like a puzzle and I’m floating in space
So lost in this galaxy of life

So I rise and fall like the tide
And I’m so full and empty inside
All those memories linger in my mind
Wish you were here with me

I said I fall into pieces
I’m here and you’ve left
Oh I fall into pieces
I’ll never see you again
I separate like a puzzle and I’m floating in space

Jimmy Barnes,"Well he's following the broken lines
Living on borrowed time
Motel rooms and broken hearts all left behind
You swear he couldn't close his eyes
As he shifts into overdrive
He's been up and down this road so many times

The man of his own
And searching just keeps him proving
That only the road
Can tame the rebel in his soul

It's the rhythm of the highway
As he rolls on down
And city lights as they fade from sight
Drives the man behind the driving wheels

Like a cowboy in a rodeo
Riding hard but never letting go
You'll be wand'ring through the twilight of his life
Waylon Jennings on the radio
Country music and engines roar
Like a shooting star across a desert sky
And he's got a home
But it's out on the blue horizon
Heaven only knows
There's still a rebel in his soul

It's the rhythm of the highway
As he rolls on down
And city lights as they fade from sight
Drives the man behind the driving wheels

And chasing southern lights
In the distant sky
And open plains with the mountains high
Drives the man behind the driving wheels

Well he's thought about settling down
A little diner on the edge of town
But in this world of push and shove
He's still got freedom in his blood

It's the rhythm of the highway",Driving Wheels
Jimmy Barnes,"Pushin' ever westward, across the great divide.
Beyond the darling river,
Towards the outback sky.

The lawless and the brave, searching for a dream.
When all they found was sand and stone,
Where rivers once had been.

They tried to follow nomads, like ghosts in desert dreams,
And suffered in a sunburnt land,
Down in the last frontier.

[Chorus]
And they sent them from the motherlands,
Into the greatest fear.
To live and die for freedoms cry,
Down in the last frontier.

A drover rides in search of work, across the sweeping plains.
A farmer kneels in a hungry church,
As his children pray for rain.

Back in a land across the sea,
They found another war.
They asked the Anzacs to believe,
In what their fighting for.

[Chorus]

And they sent them to another land,
Into the greatest fear.
To fight and die for freedoms cry,
And for the last frontier.

People in the luckly land, who searched for paradise,
Are reaching out for something more,
And they don't believe their lies.

The promises of hope and work, still ringing in their ears.
The hungry and the homeless cry,
Down in the last frontier.

[Chorus]

And they sent them to another land,
Into the greatest fear.
To live and die for freedoms cry,
And for the last frontier.

Down in the last frontier.
The last frontier.

Jimmy Barnes,"Oh Yeah

I heard about a person who had a broken heart
With nothing to drive him on, no hope no spark no flame
He couldn't see at all tears they were blinding him
He kept it all inside, the guilt and all the pain
You know I say I tried to warn him
They had him backed up against the wall
I hope I'm not too late

No one can tell you exactly what you have gotta be
You've got to stand your ground and fight to save your life
It may be hard but ooh ooh it's the only way
Always remembering there ain't no second prize
There ain't no second prize

You know I say I tried to warn him
They had him backed up against the wall
Why can't I stand up and try to tell him
They've got me backed up against the wall
I hope I'm not too late

No one can tell you exactly what you have gotta be
You've got to stand your ground and fight to save your life

Jimmy Barnes,"You walked in my life, with an angel's smile
How could I have known. The hunger locked inside
We can start a fire, but we can't control the flame
Now I just can't wait, to feel that heat again
And in the middle of the night you cry

Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
I got a burnin' heart
Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me

Just seems like yesterday, I was runnin' alone
I turned my back on love, but baby I was wrong
Do I miss your touch, do I tell myself a lie
Can't get enough, when I'm lyin' my your side
And in the middle of the night I cry

Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me
I got a burnin' heart
Too much ain't enough love to satisfy me

Slowly we begin to fall

Jimmy Barnes,"Hard as a rock, you have made your heart
And you're so sure that its me to blame
How can you lose when you hold all the cards
But who can win at a losers game
You told me that I had to live without you
Hey loneliness is no stranger to my life
And I know you'll get by

I've been waiting for the heartaches to come
I've been waiting for the tears to start to flow
I've been waiting for the heartaches to come
But it don't come at all
No it don't come at all

I'm wide awake but I feel no pain
Lying alone in this bed of thorns
Headlights scream across these walls likes flames
Is this the calm just before the storm
I thought that I could never live without you
Funny how things change when life says jump
You're not the only one

I've been waiting for the heartaches to come
I've been waiting for the tears to start to flow
I've been waiting for the heartaches to come

It don't come at all

I thought that I was headed for a broken heart
But a heart can fall so far and not apart
I'm lying in the dark

I've been waiting for the heartaches to come
I've been waiting for the tears to start to flow
I've been waiting for the heartaches to come
But it don't come at all
I'm not reaching out for you in the night
But something deep inside me says it's alright

So many times that my memories are worn

Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking

Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

I've been thinkin about you night and day
Sure been restless since you went away
You took something from me against my will
Touched a nerve in me that's tingling still
You just snuck up behind me
When my resistance was low
And nows a hell of a time to find I can't let you go
Got your first letter just the other day
Since I got it I can't put it away
I just sit and read it over and over and over again
As if the words that you wrote could bring this hurt to and end

Well you just left me here waiting
Left a wound that won't heal
God your so far away you don't know how I feel
So say you'll take a chance on this heart of mine
Don't make me the one that you left behind
And I'm not saying anybody's wrong or right
Just know I'd die to be with you tonight

I count the hours each time till your gone
I don't have to let you leave me
It makes no sense at all
If I have to follow you all around the world
I'd be willing to do anything to get to you girl

Jimmy Barnes,"Like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.
Like a worm on a hook,
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.

I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you.

Like a baby, stillborn,
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.

He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

Not for a year but ever and a day

May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay

Jimmy Bruno,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

I'd be rich as Rockefeller

And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile

When you awake you will remember ev'rything, 
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe, 
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

You can take to the left or go straight to the right,
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

Wash my hand in lye water, 
I got a date with the captains daughter. 
You can go and tell your brother.

I ain't gonna worry all day long.

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite,

At the armory

Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Where she'd bring the paper to me
And sit down on my knee and whisper oh I love you

And this old house will never be the same

Straight ahead that's the bed
Where we lay and love together
And Lord knows we had a good thing going here
See her picture on the table
Don't it look like she'd be able
Just to touch me and say good morning dear

There's her rings all her things
And her clothes are in the closet
Just like she left them when she tore my world apart
As you leave you'll see the nursery
Oh she left me without mercy

His vice was reading plays
While other children starved and fought

Jimmy Buffett,"I once knew a poet who lived before his time
He and his dog Spooner would listen as he'd rhyme
Words to make you happy and words to make you cry
And then one day the poet suddenly did die. 

But he left behind a closet filled with verse and rhymes
And through some strange transaction
One was printed in the Times
And everybody's searching for the king of underground
They found him down in Florida with a tombstone for a crown. 

And everybody knows a line from his books that cost $4.99
I wonder if he knows he's doin' quite this fine. 

'Cause his books are all best sellers and his poems were turned to song
They had his brother on a talk show though they never got along
And now he's called immortal, yes, he's even taught in school
They say he used his talents, a most proficient tool. 

But he left all of his royalties to Spooner his old hound
Growing old on steak and bacon in his doghouse ten feet 'round
And everybody wonders did he really lose his mind
No, he was just a poet who lived before his time
Yes, he was just a poet who lived before his time.",Death of an Unpopular Poet

Crazy old uncle and aunt.
They lived in a big house Ante Bellum style,
And the wind would blow across the old bayou,

Yeah, me and my cousin' Baxter
In our pup tent with a lamp.
And in a few days Baxter went home,

And I knew that I'd stay, it was better that way,
And I could get along without any help.
Life was just a tire swing. 

And I've never been west of New Orleans
Nor east of Pensacola.
My only contact with the outside
World was a n RCA Victrola.
Elvis would sing and then I'd dream about
Expensive cars, and who would've figured twenty
Years later I'd be rubbing shoulders with the stars.
Life was just a tire swing. 

'Jambalaya' was the only song I could sing.
Chasin' after sparrows with rubber tip arrows,
Knowin' I could never hurt a thing,

I fell asleep at the wheel,
But was quickly wakened up by a 'Ma Bell'
Telephone pole, and a bunch of Grant Wood
Faces screaming, 'Is he still alive?'
But through the window could see
It hangin' from a tree, and I knew
I had survived.

Jimmy Buffett,"Look'in back at my background tryin' to
figure out how I ever got here.
Some things are still a mystery to me
While others are much to clear.
I'm just livin' in the sunshine,
Stay contented most of the time.
Yeah, listenin to Murphy, Walker and Willie,
Sing me their Texas rhymes. 

Now most of the people who retire in Florida
are wrinkled and they lean on a crutch.
And mobile homes are smotherin' my keys;
Well I hate those bastards so much.
I wish a summer squall would blow them
all the way up to fantasy land.
They're ugly and square, they don't belong here.
They look a lot better as beer cans. 

[Chorus]
Yeah, That's why it's still a mystery to me,
Why some people live like they do.
So many nice things hap'nin out there,
Never even seen the clues.
Whoa, but we're doin' fine, we can travel and rhyme.
I know we've been doing our part.
Got a Caribbean soul I can barely control
and some Texas hidden here in my heart. 

Well now, I might have joined the merchant marine,
If I hadn't learned how to sing.
And on top of that I got married too early,
And it cost me much more than a ring.
But those crazy days are over,
You've just got to learn from
the wrong things you've done.
I came off the rebound, started looking around,
Figured out it's time to have a little fun. 

[Chorus]

Well now, if I ever live to be an old man,
I'm gonna sail down to Martinique.
I'm gonna buy me a sweat stained Bogart suit
and an African parakeet.
And then I'll sit him on my shoulder
and open up my trusty old mind.
I'm gonna teach him how to fuss,
Teach him how to cuss,
And pull the cork out of a bottle of wine.

Yeah, I got a Caribbean soul I can barely control
and some Texas hidden here in my heart.",Migration

Hustle on down to the bars.

That's cause everyone here is just more than

Right foot has traveled down to the

Jimmy Buffett,"Mother, mother ocean, I have heard you call
Wanted to sail upon your waters since I was three feet tall

Watched the men who rode you switch from sails to steam
And in your belly you hold the treasures few have ever seen
Most of them dream, most of them dream

Yes I am a pirate, two hundred years too late
The cannons don't thunder, there's nothing to plunder
I'm an over-forty victim of fate
Arriving too late, arriving too late
I've done a bit of smuggling, I've run my share of grass
I made enough money to buy Miami, but I pissed it away so fast
Never meant to last, never meant to last

And I have been drunk now for over two weeks
I passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks
But I got stop wishing, got to go fishing, down to rock bottom again
Just a few friends, just a few friends

I go for younger women, lived with several a while
Though I ran them away, they'd come back one day
Still could manage to smile
Just takes a while, just takes a while

My occupational hazard being my occupation's just not around

I knew it wouldn't last long
So all alone I walked back home
Sat on the beach and there I made up this song

Fifty knots or there abouts
There's white caps on the ocean

Jimmy Buffett,"Well, like to explain to you all before,
I ain't no drinkin' man
I tried it once and it got me highly irregular
And I swore I'd never do it again
I promised my brother in-law that I'd go up watch his still

While he went in to town to vote
It was right up on the mountain 
Where the map said it would be
Friends let me tell you one thing,
Tho it wasn't no ordinary still
It stood up on that mountainside 
Like a hugh golden opal

God's yeller moon shinin' on the cool clear evenin'
God's little lanterns twinklin' on and off in the heavens
Like I explain'd to you once before I ain't no drinkin' man
But temptation got the best of me
And I took a slash
That yella whiskey runnin' down my throat 
Like honey dew vine water
And I took another slash, 
Took another'n an another'n an another'n
For you knew I'd downed one whole jug of that shit
And commenced to gettin' hot flashes

Goose pimples was runnin' up and down my body
And a feelin' came over me 
Like somethin' I'd never experienced before
It was like, like I was in love

In love for the first time, with anything that moved
Animate, inanimate it didn't matter
It's like there's a great neon sign flashin' on an' off
In my brain sayin' ""Jimmy Buffett there's a great day a comin'""
'Cause I was drunk
I wasn't knee crawlin', slip slidin', Reggie Youngin'
Commode huggin' drunk
I was God's own drunk and a fearless man

And that's when I first saw the bear
He was a Kodiak lookin' fella 'bout nineteen feet tall
He rambled up over the hill 
Expectin' me to do one of two things,
Flip or fly, I didn't do either one
It hung him up

He started sniffin' around my body tryin' to smell fear
But he ain't gonna smell no fear 'cause
I'm God's own drunk and a fearless man
It hung him up

He looked right in my eyes, and my eyes 
Was a lot redder than his was
It hung him up

So I approached him, I said ""Mr. Bear, I love
Every hair on your twenty-seven acre body
I know you got a lot of friends over there
On the other side of the hill

There's ole' rare bear, tall bear, Freddy bear, Kelly bear
Really bear, smelly the bear, smokey the bear, 
Pokey the bear

I want you to go back over there tonight 
And tell them I'm feelin' right
You tell them I love each and everyone of them 
Like a brother and a sister

But if they give me any trouble tonight
I'm gonna run every God damn one of them off the hill""
He took two steps backwards and didn't know what to think
Neither did I but bein' charitable and cautious 
Well hell I approached him again

I said ""Mr. Bear, You know in the eyes of the Lord
We're both beasts when it comes right down to it
So I want you to be my buddy, Buddy bear""
So I took ole' buddy bear by his island size paw
And I led him over to the still
He's a sniffin' around that thing cause
He's smellin' somethin' good
I gave him one of them jugs of honey dew vine water
He downed it up right

Looked like one of them damn bears in the circus
Sippin' sasparilly in the moonlight
I gave him another'n an another'n an another'n
For I knew it he downed eight of them
And commenced to doin' the bear dance
Two snips, a snort, a fly turn, and a grunt
It was so simple like the jitter bug 
It plum evaded me

We worked ourselves into a tumultuous uproar
And I was awful tired and went over to the hillside
And I laid down and went to sleep
Slept for four hours and dreampt me some tremulous dreams
When I woke up, there was God's yeller moon
Shinin' on the clear cool evenin'
God's little lanterns twinklin' on and off
In the heavens

Nothing's changed at all
And Livingston's gone to Texas
They say he had a ball

They say he learned to be cowboy
They say he learned to rope and ride
But I wonder if he ever
Thinks about the tears his woman cried

Now Holly, won't you let me
Try and make you smile?
You loved him as if he were your husband
Now he'll be gone a while

Wrote he had to see the country
On starry nights he wish that you were there
And so it shows wherever he goes
Deep inside you know he really cares 

It's crazy and it's different
But it's really being free
And reasons the world would want to question
Makes sense to you and me

Jimmy Buffett,"Down to the Banana Republics
Down to the tropical sun
Go the expatriated American
Hopin' to find some fun 

Some of them go for the sailing
Brought by the lure of the sea
Tryin' to find what is ailing 
Living in the land of the free
Some of them are running to lovers
Leaving no forward address
Some of them are running tons of ganja
Some are running from the IRS 

Late at night you will find them
In the cheap hotels and bars
Hustling the senoritas
While they dance beneath the stars
Spending those renegade pesos 
On a bottle of rum and a lime
Singin' give me some words I can dance to
Or a melody that rhymes 

First you learn the native custom
Soon a word of Spanish or two
You know that you cannot trust them
Cause they know they can't trust you 

Expatriated American feelin' so all alone
Telling themselves the same lies 
That they told themselves back home 

Down to the Banana Republics
Things aren't as warm as they seem
None of the natives are buying
Any second hand American dreams 

Late at night you will find them

Jimmy Buffett,"In the shelter, in the morning as 
The sun was brightly gleaming,
I heard her crying out,
""What is it all about? I just don't know,
But I can't go back home."" 

Lonely princess, all the days out
On your own are growing empty.
Nothin' is goin' well, if you
Could only tell them how you feel.
But they're too real to understand. 

Too many trite expressions ending in
Forced rejection long ago.
Too many innocent faces in too many
Far-out places, something's wrong. 

Let me tell you that something's wrong.
It's been that way so long, and it's a shame. 

On the street car to the city, 
Where she knows that she may lose it all,
Riding for just a dime,
Takin' her own sweet and knowing well
That this could be her final fall,
Past the boutique, down the alley,
To the river, people pass her by.
She sits on the big gray rocks,
Takes off her boots and socks,
Not knowing what she will do next,
Just starts to cry. 

To many small suggestions ending in 
Angry questions from her dad.
To many TV dinners, ah, everyone
Loves a winner, but she has lost.
No ones knows the trials she had. 

In the shelter, in the morning as 
The sun was brightly gleaming,
I heard her crying out,
""What is it all about? I just 
Don't know, but I can't go back home.""
Hell, I just don't know, but
I can't go back home.",In the Shelter
Jimmy Buffett,"Now what do they do if I just sailed away
Who the hell really compelled me to leave today
Runnin' low on stories is what made it a ball
What would they do if made no landfall 

I lived half my life in eight by five room
Just crusin' to the sound of the big deisel boom
It's not close quarters that would make me snap
It's just dealing with the daily unadulterated crap 

Sail away for a month at a time,
Sail away I've got to recharge mind
Then you'll find me back at it again 

Oh I love the smell of fresh snapper fried lite
What'd you say, pouilly fuisse could round out the night
The mid morning watch is the best time to look
Oh what would they do if I wrote the big book 

'Cause I've seen incredible things in my year
Somedays were laughter, others were tears
If I had it all to do over again
I'd just get myself drunk and I'd jump right back in 

Sail away, that's the way I survive
Sail away, that's just no shuck and jive
It just makes my whole life come alive 

The wind whistled threw the cool rigging at night
Crazy crowds boogie to the sound and the lights
Down in he's just havin a ball
What would he do on another landfall
What would they do if I made no landfall
Oh what would they do if I flew to Nepal
What would I do if I met Lucille Ball
Tryin' to make a little sense of it all
Just tryin' to make a little sense of it all",Landfall
Jimmy Buffett,"I guess it all blew up in Missoula
There just was no other way
After months of going crazy
There was nothing left to say
But when the dust had finally settled
And the air had quickly cleared 
Things were better off than I had feared 

And I miss you so badly
Girl I love you madly
Feelin' so sad now since I been gone
Gone, gone
And it gets quite confusin'
It seems that I'm loosin' track of 
The long days since I been home 

Were stayin' in a Holiday Inn full of surgeons
I guess they meet there once a year
They exchange physician stories 
And get drunk on Tuborg beer
Then they're off to catch a stripper
With their eyes glued to her G
But I don't think that I would ever let them cut on me 

And I miss you so badly
Girl I love you madly
I think I been had tho, for stayin so long
Long, long
And I'm just watchin' the Gong show
Waitin' for Zorro
Loosin' the long day since I been home 

I got a head of full of feelin' higher
And an ear full of Patsy Cline
There is just no one who can touch her

Oh crazy how things happen
It's incredible but true
Oh the longer I'm gone the closer I feel to you

Jimmy Buffett,"Years grow shorter, not longer,
The more you've been on your own.
Feelin's for movin' grow stronger'
So you wonder why you ever go home,
Wonder why you ever go home. 

People are movin' so quickly.
Humor's in need of repair.
Same occupations and same obligations;
They've really got nothing to share,
Like drivin' around with no spare. 

River gets deeper not shallow,
The further you move down the stream.
Wonderin'if I can keep her as I
Race to keep up with my dreams.
How they shine and glitter and gleam. 

Years grow shorter, not longer,
The more you've been on your own.

I've given my life for songs that I sing
As a matter of fact, I've given everything
But time has come to not make a sound
Time has come to lay my burden down
Ohhh wo, ohhh wo
It's come from behind, 
Now is the time for the last line. 

I've managed to keep some friends on my side
And lived through the time of rumors and lies
But now is the time to rest my heart
Let some other innocent fool take my part

Jimmy Buffett,"He went to Paris
Looking for answers
To questions that bothered him so

He was impressive
Young and aggressive
Savin' the world on his own
But the warm summer breezes
The French wines and cheeses
Put his ambition at bay
His summers and winters
Scattered like splinters
And four to five years slipped away

Then he went to England
Played the piano
And married an actress named Kim
They had a fine life, she was a good wife
And bore him young son named Jim
And all of the answers, and all the questions
He locked in his attic one day
'Cause he liked the quiet
Clean country livin' and
Twenty more years slipped away

Well, the war took his baby
Bombs killed his lady
And left him with only one eye
His body was battered
His whole world was shattered
And all he could do was just cry
While the tears were falling and he was recalling
Answers he'd never found
So he hopped on a freighter, skidded the ocean
And left England without a sound

Now he lives in the islands
Fishes the pilings
And drinks his green label each day
Writing his memoirs
Losin' his hearin'
But he don't care what most people
Through eighty-six years of perpetual motion
If he likes you he'll smile, and he'll say,
""Jimmy, some of it's magic, some of it's tragic
But I had a good life all of the way.""

And he went to Paris
Lookin' for answers to questions
That bothered him so",He Went to Paris [Live (1978 Version)]

Dodging those deadly harpoons
Spawning their young as their ancestors done 
In the depths of her hidden lagoons

And times I feel as they do
We're on a similar course it's just a different source
But I'm in danger of extinction too

Women got 'em so confused
They don't talk about their lives as such

Some people say your half way gone

Is not unlike my own
Island they say no man is like you
They say you stand alone

Heart and soul accompaniment
That seems to make me different from you

Well I tried to book passage, but you have no ports
And I tried to sail in but your wind and waters

Silhouettes of ships in the night
Just make me long that much more

Jimmy Buffett,"In the middle of late last night I was sittin' on a curb
I didn't know what about but I was feeling quite disturbed
A street sweeper came whistlin' by
He was bouncin' every step
It seemed strange how good he felt
So I asked him while he swept

He said ""It's my job to be cleaning up this mess
And that's enough reason to go for me
It's my job to be better than the rest
And that makes the day for me""

Got an uncle who owns a bank he's a self made millionaire
He never had anyone to love never had no one to care
He always to seemed kind of sad to me
So I asked him why that was
And he told me it's because in my contract there's a clause
That says ""It's my job to worried half to death
And that's the thing people respect in me
It's a job but without it I'd be less
Than what I expect from me""

I've been lazy most all of my life
Writing songs and sleeping late
Any manual labor I've done purely by mistake
If street sweepers can smile then
I've got no right to feel upset
But sometimes I still forget
Till the lights go on and the stage is set
And the song hits home and you feel that sweat

It's my job to be different than the rest
and that's enough reason to go for me
It's my job to be better than the best
and that's a tough break for me
It's my job to be cleaning up this mess
and that's enough reason to go for me

It's my job to be better than the best
and that makes the day for me",It's My Job

The time you set sail
The crowd was steamin', streamin' and leanin' on the rail
Then the big whistle blew
And I lost my place
Next thing I knew
I could not find your face 

I can see myself dramin'
The time you came home
Your face was beamin', seemin'
To stand out alone 

The dinner bell chimed
And I found my seat
When your eyes met mine
Your smile was so sweet 

I remember that river
First time we made love
Oh I still kinda shiver a little
At what I'm thinkin' of
How your dress it just floated
All down around your knees
And I held my breath my God, my girl

But most of all it's that steamer

And the crowds always steamin', streamin' and
Leanin' on the rail

I cannot find your face",Steamer
