Hey Rosetta!,"Long we were searching
These serpentine streets for the signs of a spark
Fucking around in the dark
Then long we were held
In the thrum and the desperate heat of the clubs
Drinking deep from that cup

We'd drink it up

Each step was something
The beat in the blood and the heat in our hands
Of twelve regular men
So when we come down cathedral street
Hollow and beaten, to the room that I rent
I'm going back up again

I'm going up

But while everything is blooming
You know the wilting always waits
To steal away your body, to steal away your brains

Oh man I hate this part,
When the car sails off the bridge
Am I the knuckles white inside? or am I the water rushing in?

Am I rising up?
Singing:

Silent night, holy night
Take my eyes, take my mind and lay me down!
Oh! sweet winter kiss on these heavy lids!
Sweet winter gift of dreamless sleep, lay me down! draw me out!
No!

Doctor unbandage my eyes
I feel the light and I'm ready to be out in it
Doctor uncover my ears
I hear the chorus weeping, I see the people singing:
Doctor unbandage my eyes
I feel the light and I'm ready to be rising!
Doctor uncover my ears!
I hear the chorus weeping! I see the people singing:

Let the loser up.
Let's get him up.",Yer Spring

Hey Violet,"This guy at my school
And he looks pretty good
Always asking me when we can kick it

Well my friends think I'm wrong
But he's not what I want
'Cause he's constantly begging for pictures

And when there's cute things he'd say
I bet he stole 'em from Drake
And did I mention he wears his mom's earrings?

I know he's tall and he's fit
But I won't fall for it
Don't want his hands or his lips coming near me

'Cause he's a fuckboy
And they're all the same
Like a stain on your heart's reputation
Yeah you're a fuckboy
I've been through it before
I'd rather cut out my tongue
Then let you kiss me with yours
'Cause you're a
'Cause he's a

There's this cute guy down my street
I always wanted to meet
So I went creeping around on his socials
In all the selfies he takes
His head is tilted the same way
And his favorite hashtag is beastmode

'Cause he's a fuckboy
And they're all the same
Like a stain on your heart's reputation
Yeah you're a fuckboy
I've been through it before
I'd rather cut out my tongue
Then let you kiss me with yours
'Cause you're a
'Cause he's a

Alright listen up people far and wide
There is a growing epidemic
And it does not just affect America but the whole world
Keep your families inside, keep them safe
We must eliminate these people
And if you elect me president
I will exterminate each and every one of them!

Don't want no fuckboy
'Cause they're all the same
Like a stain on your heart's reputation
Yeah you're a fuckboy

Hey Violet,"First time I met you
Knew you would be trouble
I knew that you would break me
Turn my world to rubble baby
While you were sleeping
I swear I heard you mumble
What's her name where'd she come from
And how'd you get her number baby

You pulled the trigger
You dug the grave

All bets off
Once the gun goes off
'Cause you can't take back
Can't take back the bullet
Washed my hands
Of your bloodstained love
'Cause you can't take back
Can't take back the bullet

If you wanted out
You know you could've told me
You know you could've called
I really would've listened baby
Now that it's over
You know I'm feelin' better
Why can't you stop your beggin'
You're lookin' so pathetic baby

You pulled the trigger
This can't be saved

Love me when you sweet talk
Love her when you sleep walk",Canât Take Back the Bullet
Hey Violet,"I've got your number
I don't know how long I can wait
To call you over
So we can waste the night away
When the lights go out

We go where we go

Do what we want
We'll be the colour in all this black and white
 
Are you feeling what I'm feeling?

Don't wake me if I'm dreaming

I can feel it coming true
I can feel it, I can feel it
When I'm looking at you

Are you feeling what I'm feeling?

I can feel it, I can feel it
When I'm looking at you
 
My head is spinning
I don't know how much I can take
No fortune teller

You were my cure and I was your dark angel

Fights are meant to warn us

Else did not

Hey Violet,"I see you watching me
Eyes on your target
Mix drinks and smoke rings
It's already started
It won't be too long before me and you
Are doing what lovers do

Clothes on the floor
We're exploring our bodies
Getting you off is my new favorite hobby
Lipstick on your neck brands like a tattoo
Cause that just how lovers do

Oh, love is just another four letter word
But that never stopped nobody
Oh, either way we lose
Just like lovers, just like lovers do

His and hers closets are perfect for skeletons
Hiding resentment and shared infedelities
Cheers to regret, wash it down with some booze
Drinking like lovers do

Oh, love is just another four letter word

Oh, either way we lose
Just like lovers, just like lovers do

Hi Tide,"I was tired of my lady, we'd been together too long.
Like a worn-out recording, of a favorite song.
So while she lay there sleeping, I read the paper in bed.
And in the personals column, there was this letter I read:

""If you like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
If you're not into yoga, if you have half-a-brain.
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape.
I'm the lady you've looked for, write to me, and escape.""

I didn't think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean.
But me and my old lady, had fallen into the same old dull routine.
So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad.
And though I'm nobody's poet, I thought it wasn't half-bad.

""Yes, I like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
I'm not much into health food, I am into champagne.
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon, and cut through all this red tape.
At a bar called O'Malley's, where we'll plan our escape.""

So I waited with high hopes, then she walked in the place.
I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face.
It was my own lovely lady, and she said, ""Oh, it's you.""
And we laughed for a moment, and I said, ""I never knew"".

""That you liked Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain.
And the feel of the ocean, and the taste of champagne.
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape.
You're the love that I've looked for, come with me, and escape.""

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see

And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Hi-C,"[ VERSE 1: Hi-see ]
Bullshit, that's the title of this shit
And when you hear bullshit, you say that shit hit
Now quit, don't try to fuck with this
I just drunk some gin, I gotta take a piss
Mmh... Ahh... what a relief
All up in a girl I just released my beef
I keep huffin and puffin until I come
Yo bitch, give up the pussy and don't play (dumb)
For your body you know I been cravin
The last couple of weeks my lunch money I been savin
To get your ass in a motel
My dick is steady poundin and you're the scale
So weigh me, wait, I'm about to strip
Take off them clothes, so I can rip
That coochie, I know you want to give it to me
But hey hoe, don't try and do me
I'm cool and patiently I been waitin
Skanless stuck-up bitches, them's the ones I be hatin
And when it's time to get a dick-pack
They always come with that shitty act
(I'm sorry Hi-see, we can't go out tonight)
Fuck that shit, y'all make a nigga want to fight
So hey what's up, it's gon' be like that?
I ain't gon' ask you no more, I'm about to jack
Now take off your clothes and lay down flat
Cause that big fat pussy I got to crack
She took off her jeans, body lookin real pretty
I made a mistake when I asked to see the titties
She ripped off her bra, didn't have no fear
That shit was slappin, clappin, flappin like elephant ears
I said ""Damn"" they big as fuck
A little bit too big for Hi-see to suck
So I thought for a minute without makin a sound
It'd take at least ten minutes for me to wrestle 'em down
Threw back on her bra, tied it up in a knot
Slapped her on the padlock and said, ""Now let me see your cock""
She said, ""Ah-a, stop boy, that's enough, I quit""
Now how would you feel if I just slapped you, bitch?
I'm hittin harder than a bullet, my rhymes don't quit
I'm Hi-see, hoe, so stop poppin that bullshit

(Come on y'all, say it
Bullshit)
Yeah

The bullshti I write is the ultimate
Not the counterfeit, but the legit shit
Now trip, I'm the writer of this script
It'll make ya hop because it's so damn hip
Bullshit is like a thief, it'll run from your ass
It's sort of like diarrhea, just splishedy-splash
Bullshit is bad, it'll rough you up
Like a bitch with the drips it'll fuck you up
But then again it's tasty like beef
Like a bitch suckin your dick without no teeth
Feel good, now don't you want that feelin?
Big bullshit, that's the stuff that I'm dealin
When I'm bullshittin, here's what I do
Roll up a fat joint, grab a 40 or two
Crack open a bottle and get to down that shit
I turn on the TV, watch some nasty flicks
Now when you bullshit you're not similar to Crawf
You're locked up in the bathroom jackin off
With a goddamn nasty book inside your hand
That bullshit is for the average man
The men I know, hey, they like to fuck
Like to lick on some titties or get they dick sucked
That type of shit goes on in life
Where you bust a couple fo kids go get you a wife
I'm the hip-hop hazard Hi-see
And I will never quit, that's just the itsy-bit
Of the bullshit

Yeah
You know how I'm doin it
y'all niggaz can't fade this
Haha
Steady rollin with the punches
You know what I'm sayin?

You got it going on
I know you're makin money now
With your cute self
Ahm, just let me know what you want me to do for you?)

[ VERSE 3: Hi-see ]
I want you to fuck me and suck me and never stop lickin
(Ah-a, I ain't finna do all that) Nah, I'm just bullshittin
Cause deep down I really love ya
Hey girl, I ain't lyin, I put that on ( ? )
Now what I say might sound like drag
But I hope this bullshit don't make you mad
I know I promised you some money for you to fix your nails
But it always seem like we goin to the motel
But hey baby, I can handle this
All my homeboys say I'm so muthafuckin skanless
That it's a goddamn shame
And young girls shouldn't be allowed to mention my name
So what, I don't care, I don't give a fuck
Cause when it comes to pussy I just line 'em up
I fuck one, then I say who's next
Hi-see get mo' pussy than a goddamn Kotex
A Rough Rider when I'm fuckin a hoe
I drop my dick like Macho Man dropped the elbow
There's no age limit that I fuck
But I prefer you to be 13 on up
I been servin bullshit, now have you got your share?
Quik, tell me was it funky? (Aw, fuck yeah)

Yeah
Haha
And we just bullshittin

Threw on a beanie, 'bout 12:37
With thoughts on my mind of a 211
Threw on my fresh socks and my stomping boots
A brand new pair of brownies and my khaki suit
So I said to myself it's time to go jack
I grabbed a couple clips, loaded up the gat
I ran out the house, jumped in the Cutlass
Tired of bein broke, damn, fuck this
Hopped on the freeway lookin for the area
Showin no mercy and I'm not gonna spare ya
Searchin like a eagle but I ain't found shit
But just as the moment I was about to quit
Out jumps this Mustang doin 'bout 50
Driver bumpin sounds, he's rollin real swiftly
Now when I seen him I punched the gas
But I couldn't catch his ass cause he goin too fast
But hell yeah, I'ma get him tonight
I never wouldn'ta caught him but thanks to the red light
I'm in the left lane and he's on the right
Hey homeboy, you better check your taillights
Man, them muthafuckas don't work

He hopped out his car and walked to the back
Then I drew down with my gat, I said, ""Punk, this a jack
Empty your pockets and drop your keys""
His girl screamed out, ""Don't take his car, please""
I said, ""Bitch, get your ass out
You know what I'm about, I'll knock your ass out""
Grabbed her ass by the hair and drug her out the window
Pushed out the car while I fired up the Indo
So watch out, fool, don't let me catch ya slippin

They got to wavin, so I said fuck it
I ain't wavin back, they jumped in they bucket
Lookin in my mirror it's niggaz all on my ass
So I said to my girl I'ma have to blast
So I bust a turn on [Name] Street
Then I pulled a muthaufckin .357 out the seat
Them niggaz jumped out 12-gauge ( ? )
Give me the keys to your shit, or get shot in the rump
My girl got out first, they said (Ooh, look at that)
Not knowin my bitch had the big, big gat
I got out and just threw 'em the keys
Then my girl said (Don't take his car, please)
Looked at my girl and gave her the sign
The girl whipped out the gat and she blast three times
1 nigga laid dead
The other cocked back the gauge and shot her in the leg
""Don't shoot my girl,"" I begged and begged

Didn't know who he was, he musta lost his brain
He's ready to get beat and stomped on
A kid from Oakland tryina roll through Compton?
There's a bitch on the block named Sue
A hoe in the hood everybody been through
I didn't have to guess cause I already knew
That that's the fuckin house that he's gonna stop to
He was rollin a clean-ass Lac
On Daytons and 20s, a bumper kit in the back
I said damn, now who in the fuck is that?
He had diamonds on his hands and his chains was fat
He went in Sue house, I don't know what they was doin
But me knowiin Sue they was probably screwin
Now this nigga musta been on crack
So I rushed into my house, broke out the bumper jack
Stripped his shit and left it sittin on bricks
Fool-ass fag was in a hell of a fix
He was ready to leave the house
So I crept up to the door when I heard his big mouth
He kissed Sue and said good night
I threw my left hands on the chains, I bombed with the right
You know Sue, the stupid ass bitch
The hoe in the hood done turned into a snitch
Police pulled me over, I said what the fuck I do?
""I'm Crawf, officer, it wasn't me
""Shut up, nigger, don't they call you Hi-see?""
They turned they back, then I broke down the street
I almost got away till a K9 creeped
But it caught me and almost chewed my ass to death
I was almost dead, I had one thing left
Grabbed a 40 bottle, bust the dog in the head
Police stopped, check to see if he was dead
But by that time I was down the street
Sayin, ""Ha, you silly muthafuckas can't catch me""

Had a waist like a bass, her thighs like thunder
And her lips hot enough to suck the skin off a cucumber!
Made me wonder was she keepin it true?
Hey boo - how many niggaz you done done this to?
Keep it real, don't lie, you can tell me the truth
You've been trickin superchicken and I got proof

Stars in the night, blazing their light can't hold a candle;
To your razzle-dazzle.

Full of butterflies inside.

My rhymes is like droppin your head on cement
Crackin it open hopin to make a dent; I'm hell-bent on
resurrection, per-fection
Lesson #1: rekindle the essence
Rap ain't about bustin caps and fuckin bitches
It's about fluency with rhymin ingenuity
All of this is new to me, see I peep rhymes
with scrutiny, under a microscope I walk a tightrope
A thin line between insanity and sanity
mixed with a little vanity, boostin the morality
with Hiero hospitality, soon to strike it rich
like calories, salaries, ahh sounds like a plan
And, I will expand hip-hop as well
Might even kick a little impromptu, to stomp you
weaklings, speaking things foreign to the human ear
that, you will fear now, whether you like it or not
Blood clots on your little life on the situation
and on the stipulations... the shit you wastin
time on you pawns, it was planned like that
But we can fight back, like David Horowitz
and say we want no more of this
and put it in a cyrogenic status
Replace it with the latest in technology

Olly olly oxen free, get off of me

to come back in then the same old skit happens
You say you rappin but you don't know the essence
Just hoe slap and bustin caps is your message
Plus every time I put some scrill down, you steal it
If that's your way of teachin me a lesson I don't feel it
Your raps reflect your life and that's a shame
cause the way you're soundin, you must think that it's a game
I can see if you came from the ghetto, but you came
from the Meadow -- you really need to let that go
You got no respect for hip-hop, and you tryin to rhyme
Biding your time and I find it a crime
I even tried to bury the hatchet man
Cause we all African, you want to be a rapper
start practicin, you can't even flow right
Spend most of your time fuckin hoes, getting in fights
Hangin out, with no mission in life
And you're missing your life, and you'll be missing out on life

Crescent moon attack stance if you glance at the mic

They need vitamins and ginseng
If you fencing with these you get stabbed in the heart

Tapping the soul of my enemies, capturing their energies
Disappear from the stage like the vanisher
Grabbin the mic and drive a spike right through the center
For these niggaz all sequenced up like the spinners
I get the crowd high like paint thinners
And watch me cruise, crackle and splinter
They can't tackle the impenetrable sound
Sciences of Hieroglyphics even with assault rifles
And silencers, M-16s ain't hitting nothing
When we corrupting rappers
Togetherness like alpha flight when we write 
The unmistakable interaction in your ears, outta sight
Fightin in a circle, we workin the mic 2 deep
Pass that mothafucka so I can sink my teeth in
Center myself, then I walk through the flames
AKA The Mangler, feelin no pain
No stranger to the danger room I'm into
Meditation, blood coursin through my veins
So the thoughts came interlaced with the taste of victory
I'm slippery, rippin these niggaz apart
From start to finish...and it don't stop (Keep on)

Put Toure on the mixer, smooth as an elixir plus
The meritorious flows of us
Get a glorious response you're boring next to John
I'm the only individual not capable of having a prime-time
Can't capture this rapper from this present day backwoods
To the depths of antiquity no one can get with me
I used to battle Socrates rockin these same styles
Inventor of math and science, holdin my style
Showin defiance to the gangsta jargon you barkin
Metaphysically sparkin in psyche when mic's in my face
Compile salt-peter to blow up the place

Manifested by the northwestern regions

Replenishing with my menacing sentencing
Up inside this, oblige with guidance
From the funk expanding verb triton
I glance upon the multitudes of weak and seek
To organization concentration camps so they can get lobotimized
Fuck so bad, you feel sodomized
Time for words to be colonized
To keep regards tall in size
Erecting the best things in life
My flows composed of foe-sas
My enemies cheese in my face and embrace my palm
I hella spurn, but my face is calm
Keeping the hip-hop scene vibrant
I come alive with good tide, it's fine, and MC's silent
Milestones in Hiero history
Led you wishin' we was never released, at least
Even if our demo tapes add to the myth of Hiero's gifts
Those that don't agree is just pleading the Fifth
Proceeding to enscript the code

Too much imagination got you facing defeat

And logged to augmentated tales that keep you mind tensing

The coldcuts
Make the whole planet panic and when it blows up
I hit'em again and again

I rather let it just crank when niggas be on the dick like a nympho
I murder'em like hurdling obstacles
It cause holocaust, all I got is word and balls
I'm hot pepper, that you don't want to taste to see
So just watch me lace the beat gracefully
And ain't a nigga got a thang to say
My broken language slay niggas that came this way
Aimlessly
My automatic's spray reck havoc and mayhem
If you got something to say, come to bay
And get it off your chest
Then put it to rest
Another competitor bested
Ready to, just shut the hell up
Develop your skill, and get enveloped still
With my nigga Del up, to bat turn, yellow belly, and lilly livered
We delivered the russian roulette
You never know it might get you wet
I'll make a issue out of that bitch, you turned to diss (WHO)
Thee invincible, Hieroglyphics crew,
I'll grab that ass by that braid and shock you like Raiden
Wash you mouth out with dick, and keep skating pass
The irrelvant punk that pump fiction
But no, he don't want no friction
I got a mic addiction that I don't want to kick
Mine's are original rhymes that are three-dimensional
Inching up to the pinnacle and cranking my engine up
And then I'm out with the middle finger up
And a perpetual ""S"" on my chest, just to let you know
We still the best

Is in Jamaica, the heart-breaka lyrics
Like a stake through your left pectoral your shit is horrible
I'm clean, like brand new Mo-Mo's on a Porsche
And your shit is sittin on rims, let me begin
To elaborate, rings on his hands like each finger was Saturn
And the latest fashions but the same patterns
Kept flashin up in his rap, concerned with, glamorous
Tales of fatalities like he was Tarantino
The analogy is that we know that Quentin write Fiction
Fantasies, woven intricately, while I'm predicting
Every motion, them slight changes in your tone of voice
Is a toast to your parasitic choice of speak
Leakin cold blood out the arteries if you bit

Cause and effect, pause for respect collection

With top secret floppy disk and battle armor and mega

Electri-fying, defying laws of gravity (what?)
Avidly rapidly firing lyrics I'm shattering
The abdominal cavity, then I'm travelling out the spinal
Finalizing your paralysis on the microphone (what?)

Ain't no MC hurtin me, matter of fact you work for me
Havoc stricken palladiums made me numb
To anything you speak to desecrate the great Hieroglyphics
And with it goes the flows that chop egos, to segments
Behind the decimal points, I point backwards
When you lack words you toil but boil I coil clowns
All around, repellin sellin statues of wack groups
Statues for Hieroglyphic travellers
Any lackluster MC's I mallux ya, right on your cranium crack it
Bust your teeth through your limbs and then tip you over
If you know of Del, well then
I ill constantly with consonants, followed by nouns and make
Mounds of manuscripts to whip challengers, that ain't
Too talented, so before I reach my destintation
Let's waste some MC's for fun (yeah)
I understand the fans needs so I feed em smorgasboards
So they can gorge and MC's can gouge they eyes out, from the teargas
Emitted from my tongue, leaving fans sprung
And for the crews who high-strung, eat dung (ewww)
They just gnats and ticks, bugging me (bzzzzzzz)
Hugging me nuts in a cuddly clutch, my
Hieroglyphic theory is validated by facts
Dilated the tracks, so they wide and fat
Violated the wax, but colonized the wise words
With more enzymes ten times nutritional
Unintentional, my flows just go there, yeah

Illuminating the land with liberation
And mysterious, ferociously, serious black man
Experience the urban warfare of fully strapped assault
As an angel hoping my benevolence will change you
Singing folklore of the poor
Natural born warrior
Since the days of Spain was ruled my the Moors
Then again, before your existence
Imhotep
The presenter of the mystics
Geometry, trigonometry statistics
It's simplitics embedded in my bloodline
Just like the pain of my forefathers
The chains of slavery remains
Behaviors we obtained in days that we were slained and tortured
Tormented and scorned
Shackles on my feet, feeding me pork
Lashes on my back, lost my family
Not to belittle the middle passage calamity
I gotta make decisions
Cause I keep havin' visions of flight bombing politicians
On some midnight marauder missions
It gets harder
They shut down your energy, cut off your water
Close the gas station, food supply shortened
Dying of starvation and smoke ventilation

You know what, I'ma tell as I'm sipping on this brew
You know it's wrong and true
So what you gonna do?
The truth is long overdue 2X

[Tajai]
I'm talking bout
Demolitions, ammunition
No more propositions or petitions
Seditions met with lynchings and whippings
But they won't crush my wishes into submission
Foresight courtesy of 3rd Eye Vision
Tells me hit 'em
Get 'em before they first force strike
Meet in the black of the night
Dodging ghetto pterodactyl lights
Bring the full gats and precious metals if you true dat
Get wise with medical supplies
Conceptualize and plan
Or get caught with your ass wide open
And not get to ask
""Why"", I'm hoping you hear
And I'm hoping your here
For the millennium season opener
I keep ample degrees up my sleeve
For brothers who no longer breathe
No reprieves
Nothing but memories to retrieve
Black babies disease
Stomachs distended, arms out stretched
For any care extended
This is the flock to which I am attended
But I'll do it
I'm committed, commending
All commandants vowing to be uncommon
Fuck the promenade
Underground and granite-strong, granted
The path is jagged and long
And we look raggied
But I want more than this wall at my back in days
Back we would have been mobile
It's time to make power moves
And put the all in all-powerful, all in all
I can't close my eyes
And I would be a coward too
And so would you, so sir
Are yor scared?, no sir
I see answers to irradiate
Eradicate this cancer
They won't catch me playing patty cake with hands up
You might catch me spraying
But I think you better get them flight masks up

I'm ready

Yeah, ah huh

Tell me this are you prepared to live?

[Pep Love] 

I'm about as swift as lightning greased 

[Opio] 

And I'm cold like Sub-Zero feel the deep freeze 

[Both] 

We the ones that make you feel right 
You need to open up your eyes and see delight 

[Opio] 

I'm at ease when I'm next to my keys 
Not the narcotic 
The Ensoniq ASR-X is my symphonic weapon
Stepping to these creations is like attempting to scale the Appalachian 
Mountains 
It's damn near impossible 
Without rigid preparation and lots of pull 
Delight 
Profound lyrics spit into mics 
Irresistible to bite on stage 
The instrumental incites the freestyle 
Fake MC's bust written raps 
Pupils dilatin 
Agonizing forgetting raps 
While I'm shining intensely 
Reflecting off the Hieroglyphic shield 
For real 
Reinventing hip hop 

[Pep Love] 

Open up your eyes and see delight [delight fades] 
You better open up your eyes and see delight [delight fades] 

[Pep Love] 

It go, Cancer the crab is my zodiac sign 
F.L. is the crew, I'ma let my light shine 
We multi-faceted, feel good pharmacist at this 
Now listen to the lyricist cease 
And desist so we can leave em deceased
If not stressed till they suicidial 
I ingest the mic 
Just a test of sound 
If I impressed, see delight on my face 
In the place of mess 
First Light 
The recipe for Saucee, serves you right 
You can ask Martini and Rossi 
You don't want to grapple with that bullshit 
I'll pull a rabbit out my hat if I wanted trick 

[Pep Love] 

Open up your eyes and see delight [delight fades] 
You better open up your eyes and see delight [delight fades] 

[Opio] 

What are you doing? 
You're confused like a hermaphrodite 
Rapping like this one or that one won't get you capped at night 
Or shanked in the morning sun 
At the venue 
If you continue to disregard these warnings 

[Pep Love] 

Running into some problems 
Mic to mic, you must resuscitate 
Life in your mental state 
Trife when we infiltrate 
Tonight the light is felt 

[Opio] 

Like encountering an asteroid belt 
You gets pelted, welted up 
Face is green like a Celtic or Wimbly stadium 
Center court 
No back support 
You just a gelatin skeleton 
Lyric like a elephant tranquilizer 
Impeding your development 

[Pep Love] 

I'm runnin amuck, dumb fucks
And gunning 'em up 
They awe-struck by the light like deer
Game for the hunter, predator 
Ready to taste blood 
So blaze up a blunt and pass that shit here 

[Opio] 

Yeah, they need light like photosynthesis 
Biting sentences 
Witness to thee inventiveness 
That you can't resist 
Painful like a pistol whipping 

[Pep Love] 

Niggas is tripping they get dissed 
I mind my business which is this 
Ripping microphones 
Scratching suckers off my list 
With speed 
A level that you can't exceed 
I give the people what they want 
You need to take heed

Life is a blast when you know what you're doin'
Best to know what you're doin' 'fore your life get ruined
Life is a thrill when your skill is developed
If you ain't got a skill or trade, then shut the hell up

My rhymes is like droppin your head on cement
Crackin it open hopin to make a dent; I'm hell-bent on
resurrection, per-fection
Lesson #1: rekindle the essence
Rap ain't about bustin caps and fuckin bitches
It's about fluency with rhymin ingenuity
All of this is new to me, see I peep rhymes
with scrutiny, under a microscope I walk a tightrope
A thin line between insanity and sanity
mixed with a little vanity, boostin the morality
with Hiero hospitality, soon to strike it rich
like calories, salaries, ahh sounds like a plan
And, I will expand hip-hop as well
Might even kick a little impromptu, to stomp you
weaklings, speaking things foreign to the human ear
that, you will fear now, whether you like it or not
Blood clots on your little life on the situation
and on the stipulations... the shit you wastin
time on you pawns, it was planned like that
But we can fight back, like David Horowitz
and say we want no more of this
and put it in a cyrogenic status
Replace it with the latest in technology
Hip-Hop policies that demolish ya follies
Olly olly oxen free, get off of me
You can't see this, your defeatist attitude'll
get you nowhere fast, I tend to my task cause

Life is a blast when you know what you're doin'
Best to know what you're doin' 'fore your life get ruined
Life is a thrill when your skill is developed
If you ain't got a skill or trade, then shut the hell up

Life is a blast when you know what you're doin'
Best to know what you're doin' 'fore your life get ruined
Life is a thrill when your skill is developed
If you ain't got a skill or trade, then shut the hell up

Don't even start on the next man, let's scan
your situation, you still have no patience
Flip on niggaz, rob niggaz, even family
All the way up to your moms -- you can't stand to be
in the house, but when you kicked out you beggin
to come back in then the same old skit happens
You say you rappin but you don't know the essence
Just hoe slap and bustin caps is your message
Plus every time I put some scrill down, you steal it
If that's your way of teachin me a lesson I don't feel it
Your raps reflect your life and that's a shame
cause the way you're soundin, you must think that it's a game
I can see if you came from the ghetto, but you came
from the Meadow -- you really need to let that go
You got no respect for hip-hop, and you tryin to rhyme
Biding your time and I find it a crime
I even tried to bury the hatchet man
Cause we all African, you want to be a rapper
start practicin, you can't even flow right
Spend most of your time fuckin hoes, getting in fights
Hangin out, with no mission in life
And you're missing your life, and you'll be missing out on life
I won't sweat you for that G you stole
cause if you're still alive, I'll be there to see you fold
Told ya!

Life is a blast when you know what you're doin'
Best to know what you're doin' 'fore your life get ruined

Life is a blast when you know what you're doin'
Best to know what you're doin' 'fore your life get ruined
Life is a thrill when your skill is developed
If you ain't got a skill or trade, then shut the hell up

You could be a rapper an actor a gun clapper
A comedian providing laughter as a bachelor
A pastor of a chapter, a doctor, a lawyer
A fireman, a hired hand, whether boy or girl
it's your world your future you control it
Whatever you do, early on, is how you mold it
I record it, sold it, told it to you
Mr. Del wouldn't tell you nothin that ain't true, because

Life is a blast when you know what you're doin'
Best to know what you're doin' 'fore your life get ruined
Life is a thrill when your skill is developed
If you ain't got a skill or trade, then shut the hell up

It's not a wrong thing
To be addicted to the microphone like a heroin fiend
I'll tell you one thing
You'll never catch me fronting
As I proceed to give the people what they wanting
You're making some green
But not for glamour or fashion
I'm stacking cash until I can get moms a mansion
All from rapping?
Nah, man, there's many plans
Like investing in land
It started all from impressing the fans
With brand-new flows
And you know
All the way from gangsta clones to weirdos
Fools used those
But we ain't tripping
Give respect when you see this
You need us
Or your rhymes underdevelop like a foetus

Those that know, not doze
And it shows
When we broke out the knock
Hoes hopped out they clothes
That's positive feedback
Yep, The prose
I'm poised, we never pose, you'll never know
From ninety-three 'till infinity, we've been inventive
Creating the bump is our only incentive
And it's been a long time since I feel I've been felt
But the only thing I fear is fear itself
So you know what we gots to do
Maybe could we keep it within the crew
Like it should be?
Never givin' out
We're livin' out our dreams
If there's something I can't live without

Onto the next stage, while emcees need aid
Stay paid, I'm still grade-A
None of that tomfoolery
As you can see, this shit ain't nothing new to me
Utterly hovering over other things material
You're stuck in the here and now
Plus you're sweating profusely, here's a towel
Your fears are now reality
When I take your dream states
And elaborate on how your team's fake
Like phony IDs, but sometimes I feel like
Only I see through the charade you've made
In today, but hey, tomorrow it's played
And then they got a new fool in your place to be okayed

Rekindling in ways that many thought was lost
In this contemporary maze of methods to floss
We finding trees and trails to blaze
Boundaries to cross
We can be found beyond the bounds of reason
Or earthbound, heatin' up the Coliseum

They rushed the stage full-throttle in Chicago
Our brains interlocked
Where fakin' emcees get caught with the forty-bottle
Or get their chains snatched, pronto
We unstoppable, droppin' flows in Toronto
Maneuverin' through Vancouver and on to Japan
Where they put major grands in my hand
Follow

Gimme 6 lines...6 lines...that's all I need

[Pep Love]
Alright, ok
I write in the light of day and in the night for pay, nigga!
You my main motherfucker, right?
You duck and hide when Pep Love touch a mic
Out the back door
If you ain't got that dough
I'll click clack blow and kick down doors
I roll backwood trees with that emerald green
When I'm on the scene, chillin with my nigga Rolls gettin blown
Watchin ladies with them pretty eyes and straight teeth
Sittin' in my ride, playin make belief
Like that's my car!
That's my girl!
I'ma go up to my house in the hills after I burn one
I write rhymes for the fun of it
But give me all my money or your gonna be facin capital punishment
I'ma soldier of fortune
My style is extortion
And I'm gorging more than a portion


[Tajai]
Take an excoursion, oceanography odyssey-D
Ballin' 3-D
You don't want to see me, not for one second!
Not for one bar on one record
You think you come hard, then come test it
I'll turn a threat into a confession
I'll turn a mic into a blunt weapon
Make you forget what you was once reppin'
See I'm a bass drum beater
Mad high hatter
Ensnare the snare with this here
Choke the life out 'it
Revive it and vitalize 'it
Prop it up proper so you guys'll idolize it
I'm not at all surprised that you're modelled after my shit
The masterminds is ahead of whatever the times is!

You niggaz saps...maple leaf
All your raps is make believe
I get an eighth and breathe like I'm Toni Braxton
Get up on the action...you gettin no reaction
Slowly stogie packin'
Lean back one foot up
Your style is put up
My turn to burn good up
You're boring...I'll suffocate you while you're snoring
'Kill 'em Softly' like Lauren
You spit and I'm pouring
My flow's adequately hydrated
And I waited to vibrate it
It's live ain't it!
Fuck with me, get stuck with cutlery
Luxury, I'm living luckily!

[Opio]
Music is my sanctuary (it's my life!)
They shootin blanks
My every round is a live one
Surviving the mind numbing propaganda
Eyes closed with blindfolds
Handcuffed and ambushed, struck by the lightning bolt (oh shit!)
I'm comin out your plasma screen like 'The Ring'
Make excellent cadavers of your fascist regime
Cause I grab the mic and niggaz couldn't understand
Why I'm fuckin' up your summer jam like the son of sam
And punishin'
Dressed in black with a skull on chest
And holdin' my nuts exposin my 5-star general
That's spittin flow...unpredictable
Ricochetin'

Vindictive with voodoo
Valiantly save the virgin from the viper
Vanglorious vide vorld of volcanic violence

Void your vibration

Reverberate for your convertible

Yeah...yeah
Hard nose in the contest like Ron Artess
The con artist
Bombard 'em and start 'em in Vangar (?) shit
Get serious...grown from expeirence, and our shit
A lyricist to the tissue...bones and cartilage
My fare for the hair raising
Razor sharp with rare phrasing
Perfectly scripted like Scorcese's 'Raging Bull'
Lanky like Hiralanko (?)
Paid in full
I skipped grades in school
Exhume verb and further with no sherm (?) on the burner
Mostly Turkish hash on the purple grass in the sterling
Wave your checkered flags, I'm world class in the derby
Paragraphs off the flow chart topsy-turvy

Yeah...every day A respresent
With a weed habit affecting the trade defecit
They ain't never met...nobody like me
Til they comin' in from work...see me holdin they wifey
In the 80's, I was spoken ice
Not from diamonds, but rhymin' and flowin precise
Type of nigga that get ya scolded politely
It really wouldn't show if I was holdin'
That's why no one would fight me

Kept his eyes on the road and his fists clinched tight
It was all over something that didn't matter at all
But he just had to tell her that she was wrong

Then a car swerved, his life flashed right before his eyes
And as he slammed on those brakes a voice whispered inside

If the last thing you did was the last thing you do
If the last word you said was the last breath you drew
Would you be o.k. with the way they remember you
If the last thing you did was the last thing you do

Then a thousand regrets ran through his mind
Like his sons baseball game that he missed last night
All those times he worked late, now he wondered why

Oh and leaving this morning with no goodbye kiss

He pulled his car on the shoulder wiped a tear as he picked that phone up
And he told her how much he loved her and now he can't say it enough",The Last Thing You Do

And a hot homemade apple pie in the passenger seat
She said ""you'll always be my baby""

And I realized as I look back... that

They weren't just saying goodbye
They weren't just seeing me off
They were just making sure I don't forget where I'm from
Momma loved and daddy worked
They lived their lives just to make sure I know
My way back home

I can still smell momma's kitchen
Feel every single prayer she says for me
I can point these wheels towards that sunset
Without a fear, without a doubt, daddy said ""go get that dream""
I left behind a pie crumb trail just in case I get lost, fall flat or fail
And if the wind should lead my sail

To the love that's always waiting after being good too long

We pull him out when we need him

Highwater Rising,"She could climb from her window over to my house
We would hide up in my room
Where she'd feel safe for awhile
And keep the windows open for the blue skies she'd say
Even when it rained
She kept her ears wide
In case her parents ever called her name
And she owned and told me the truth when
We were on the phone
She'd like to change her name
She'd like to think of stories about places she'd never been
She knows, she made me believe
I loved everything about her and she was in love with me
But she had to go

Mother was too good for her
Daddy wasn't ever good enough
Through the years of fighting
He never noticed how much she grew up
When I last saw her at the corner of two streets
She looked tired
Like she might do something right
She got a job, saves money on a car she never loved
She never looked back
And I always thought that I could be the one
To make her stay
She liked to stay out late, drinking and acting crazy
She was just waiting
I tried to hold her hand
I understood but I could never understand
Why she had to go

I heard her mother's doing her good
I heard her father died last spring
They sold her house last week
And no she still hasn't heard a thing
But I don't think that I'll be the one to tell her
She'd like to change her name
She'd like to think of stories of places she'd never been

Highway 101,"There is a young cowboy, he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me

Hikaru Utada,"Let's hide the truth with the best lie
Let's decieve the reality with the greatest dream
Even though we're such a couple
I don't want to lose you
Say, why are you so uneasy?
I don't want anything like a stable love

Let's throw off our shoes together
And run off barefooted
-I'll never let go-
Swimming in the apathy
I've gone running in the doubts
-I'll never let go-
Let's throw off our shoes together
And run off barefooted
-I'll never let go-
Even if your eyes are blinded by the sun
Don't let go your hand
-I'll never let go-

Let's entrust our sadness to the gentle rain
And recall happiness
I can't see where we're going
But I'm not afraid
Where are our tomorrow selves?

Let's throw off our shoes together
And run off barefooted
-I'll never let go-
Swimming in the apathy
I've gone running in the doubts
-I'll never let go-
Let's throw off our shoes together
And run off barefooted
-I'll never let go-
Even if your eyes are blinded by the sun
Don't let go your hand
-I'll never let go-

Hikaru Utada,"Poets often use many words
To say a simple thing
It takes thought and time and rhyme 
To make a poem singing

With music and words I've been flying
For you I have written a song
To be sure that you'll know what I'm saying
I'll translate as I go along

Fly me to the moon, 
And let me play among the stars
Won't you let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars
In other words: Hold my hand!
In other words: Darling, kiss me!

Fill my heart with song, 
And let me sing forever more
You are all I long for all I worship and adore
In other words: Please be true!
In other words: I love you!

In other words: Please be true!
In other words: I love you!

Com'on, just take me to the moon... yeah

By the door you said you had to go

So I kept on staring out the window

Calling you, calling you home
You, calling you, calling you home

I am a natural entertainer, aren't we all
Holding pieces of dying ember
I'm just trying to remember who I can call
Who can I call

Home, calling you, calling you

I run a secret propaganda
Aren't we all hiding pieces of broken anger
I'm just trying to remember who I can call
Can I call

Hikaru Utada,"Late at night I think about you sometimes
I don't cry, I wonder if you're alright
Late at night, I think about you sometimes
Wonder why I wonder if you're alright
Thinking of the love we made
Ran around, out of town, now you're back again
Confusing true love and pain
Threw it down, now I'm back on my feet again

Are you asleep
Or are you still afraid of the dark
Hugs and Kisses, pictures and romances
Things that I wish I could do without

How many nights did I wander in the dark
Counting secrets of my heart
Now and then I wonder 'bout
Who's eating, sleeping with you now
How many times did I kiss you in the dark
Watching memories depart
Then again I wonder 'bout
But I don't give a damn about you

Take a bite; the pleasure is all mine
Keep in mind I'll think about you sometimes
I'm alright; I'll think about you and I'll
Turn this plight into a singer's delight
Living in a house of pain
Ran away, and I'm glad that I ran away
Rather be out in the rain
Now I understand why my mother ran away

No use asking
When did I start acting like such a jerk (you too)
Washing dishes, birthday wishes, watching baseball matches
The other future that I wonder 'bout
So many things I wish I didn't wonder 'bout

How many nights did I wander in the dark
Counting secrets of my heart
Now and then I wonder 'bout
Who's eating, sleeping with you now
How many times did I kiss you in the dark
Watching memories depart
Now and then I wonder but I betcha
I betcha don't give a damn about

How many nights did I wander in the dark
Counting secrets of my heart

I wish I knew you place no one above me

Hikora,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Hikora,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Lovely one, so radio, let's do it
Can you feel it? I know you feel it
I know you feel of that

Let me talk to you, baby, I'm digging your style
The way you lick your lips is like hmm, oww
You driving me wild with your sexy self
Your pretty little face got me hypnotized

All I wanna know, is you down to ride
I can open up the door and you could come inside
I could show you what life could be
I could show you it's just you and me

We can go to the mall, you can have it all
I can tell you're impress by the way I ball
One shot with you and I will trade it all
The girls in the shows, I talk about everything

Your touch is a beautiful thing
We can shine together like a diamond ring
I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life and make my dreams come true

All I ever wanted was a girl like you
Someone I can give my heart to
All I ever needed was someone like you
Someone I can give my heart to

[Incomprehensible] papi, if I put you to the test
Would you differ from the rest
Or you wanna be my homey that owns me
And holds owns me only when you lonely, lonely ?

I'll inform you when I'm looking for a friend
Until then, I need a man to take a stand
Hold my hand, I'm just scared of situation, temptations
No hesitation when it comes to us

I got it with single touch
Doesn't take much, so baby, just hush
Trust, everything's gonna be okay
If you do it my way, my way

Hey, you wanna be with me
I'll fulfill all your fantasies, be the girl of your dreams
Holding you tight all through the night
You'll even love when we fight

All I ever wanted was a girl like you
Someone I can give my heart to
All I ever needed was someone like you
Someone I can give my heart to

We can do them things that lovers do
Or we can be friends and keep it cool

Go ahead, baby with yo' bad self
Looking all fine, lollipop in your mouth
Standing on the curve with yo' bad ass curve
One look, whoa and I had to observe

I let my eyes finesse you, my mind caress you
Booty like a tenderoni
If I could make you mine, you'll be my one and only
You make me say oh like Mister Capone

Just one look is all it took
Got me lost in your eyes
And you mesmerized by my lips
Hips and thighs, oh my, oh my

I'm riding by your side, high
Taking my time when I'm working that body
So [Incomprehensible] got you talking naughty
Oh yeah, can you feel it? Oh yeah

All I ever wanted was a girl like you
Someone I can give my heart to
All I ever needed was someone like you
Someone I can give my heart to

Can you feel it? I know you feel it

The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from missouri never incensed me
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned

How many, many times the worm had turned

They all laughed when edison recorded sound
They all laughed at wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly

They told marconi

They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through

Ford and his lizzie

Hilary Ann Feldman,"I went home for Christmas
To the house that I grew up in
Going back was something after all these years
I drove down Monterey Street
And felt a little sadness
When I turned left on Laurel and the house appeared
And I snuck up to that rocking chair
Where the winter sunlight slanted on the screened-in porch
And I stared out past the shade tree
That my laughing daddy planted on the day that I was born

And I let time go by so slow
And I made every moment last
And I thought about years
How they take so long
And they go so fast

Across the street the Randol's oldest daughter must have come home
Her two boys built a snowman by the backyard swings
I thought of old man Randol and his Christmas decorations
And how he used to leave them up till early spring

And I though of all the summers
That I paced that porch and swore I'd die of boredom there
And I thought of what I'd give to feel another summer linger
Where a day feels like a year

And I let time go by so slow
And I made every moment last
And I thought about years
How they take so long
And they go so fast

Then the door flew open, and my mother's voice was laughing
As she called back to my daddy, ""Come look who's here""
And I thought about years

And I let time go by so slow
And I made every moment last
And I thought about years
How they take so long
And they go so fast",Years

To static on the radio

Then a voice said

Where Christmas is always snowy white
On my list, is just one wish that it would snow tonight}

When the snow comes down in Tinseltown
There'll be dancing in Hollywood
Slippin' and slidin' and
Sleigh riding all over the neighborhood

You'll be rocking with a stocking on your head
So the cold won't get to you
On Christmas eve you can believe
That wishes do come true

Oh, when the snow comes down
Oh in Tinseltown
On Christmas eve
You will believe
When the snow comes down
In Tinseltown

You close your eyes, and to your surprise
You see the Reindeer fly
It's choir singing fa la la la la
Go walking by

Singing and ringing ride along
And Church bells in the air
It seems so real, that you can feel
The snowflakes in your hair

Oh, when the snow comes down
Oh in Tinseltown
On Christmas eve
You will believe
When the snow comes down
In Tinseltown

In the morning, when you awake
Your face all shining bright
And when you look outside
You see the palm trees dressed in white!

{Dear Santa thank you, thank you
For that perfect Christmas day
Gliding down the streets of Hollywood
In a one horse open sleigh}

Oh, when the snow comes down
Oh in Tinseltown
On Christmas eve
You will believe
When the snow comes down
In Tinseltown

Oh, when the snow comes down

Hilary Duff,"What wishes will you make when the season is near,
Will your dreams be the same as they were last year,
Will you ask for a little,
Will you ask for a lot,
And when you make your list,
Will there be something you forgot

How bout peace on earth,
It can't be bought or sold,
How bout peace this Christmas,
In someone's hands to hold,
How bout love in our hearts,
And hope for you and me,
How bout peace on earth,
That's what Christmas should be

Did you get all the things that you've been waiting for,
Snowfall, the presents, Choir singing at your door,
The season will be perfect,
Like those picture postcard scenes,
But is that the answer,
Is that what Christmas really means

How bout peace on earth,
It can't be bought or sold,
How bout peace this Christmas,
In someone's hands to hold,
How bout love in our hearts,
And hope for you and me,
How bout peace on earth,
That's what Christmas should be

What would you sacrifice,
What would you give away,
For the greatest gift of all,
Of Christmas day

How bout peace on earth,
It can't be bought or sold,
How bout peace this Christmas,
In someone's hands to hold,
How bout love in our hearts,
And hope for you and me,
How bout peace on earth...

How bout peace on earth,
It can't be bought or sold,
How bout peace this Christmas,
In someone's hands to hold,
How bout love in our hearts,
And hope for you and me,
How bout peace on earth,
That's what Christmas should be

Hilary Duff,"Some days I star off draggin' my feet
Some days I want to fly
Some days it all makes sense to me
Some days I just don't want to know why

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, I'm not giving up, no
Gonna stand up and shout it
No way, I'm not slackin' off or backin' out or crackin' up without doubt
I'm workin' it out

Sometimes I'm just surrounded by friends
Sometimes we've never met
Sometimes I pray for something I need
But hey, you never know what you're gonna get
And

Hilary Duff,"When I'm in a crowd
Or on an island by myself
Silent or too loud
Wishing I was somewhere else
And I can't believe
You hit me fast and hard
When you turn to me and say
Never change the way you are

Trying to catch your eye
Things will never look the same
Now I can't deny
You're the moth and I'm the flame
There I go again
I should walk before I run
How can I explain
I can't stop what you've begun

I'm falling through the door
Flying 'cross the floor
When you look at me suddenly it's clear

You're burning up my dreams
Crazy as it seems
I don't want to be anywhere but here
Anywhere but here

What goes on inside
Is a mystery no doubt
A roller coaster ride
I may never work it out
Here's the brand new me
Skates around and floats on air
I'm a sight to see
Rainbow colors in my hair
You have set me free
The one who gets me there

I'm falling through the door
Flying 'cross the floor
When you look at me suddenly it's clear

Here is the place where
My head is spinning
Time is beginning
To race away
You come to throw me
Knock me off my feet
You give me wings to fly
The world goes crashing by again

I'm falling through the door
Flying 'cross the floor
When you look at me suddenly it's clear

I'm falling through the door
Flying 'cross the floor
When you look at me suddenly it's clear",Anywhere But Here
Hilary Duff,"I won't tell you what I'm thinking
'Cause it's not the same thing you're thinking too

You could say I got a best friend
And she's always tellin' me what to do

She's out of sight but easy to find
She's in the front of our minds

The little voice in my head
Won't let me forget
The little voice in my head
Is never misled
All of this noise is what
Keeps me from making a mess
The little voice in my head
Just won't let me get with you

La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

When I see you I admit
I start to lose my grip
And all of my cool
Ya' smell so sweet
Just like my perfume
What have you been doing since I left you

You're always there in my thoughts
But that doesn't mean that it's on

The little voice in my head
Won't let me forget
The little voice in my head
Is never misled
All of this noise is what
Keeps me from making a mess
The little voice in my head
Just won't let me get with you

I know I sound insane like I'm playin' games
'Cause all I really want is you
But there's some things a girl won't do

Oh oh!

The little voice, the little voice!

The little voice in my head
Won't let me forget

Is never misled
All of this noise is what
Keeps me from making a mess

Just won't let me get with you",Little Voice
Hilary Duff,"When the night won't fall and the sun won't rise
And you see the best as you close your eyes
When you reach the top as you bottom out
But you understand what it's all about

Nothing's ever what it seems
In your life or in your dreams
It don't make sense, what can you do
So I won't try makin' sense of you

[Chorus]
Love just is, whatever it may be
Love just is, you and me
Nothing less and nothing more
I don't know what I love you for, love just is

When you ask to stay and disappear
It seems you're gone but you're really here
When every move seems out of place
But every kiss is filled with grace

Some things never get defined
In your heart or in your mind
It don't make sense, what can you do
So I won't try makin sense of you

Don't ever ask me for reasons
I can't get to you
Don't ever ask me for reasons

What I am all about
If you don't know what the answer is
Then just shut up and kiss

It shouldn't take forever
To put it all together

[Chorus]
If you can't do the math 
Then get out of the equation
I am calling you back
This is star 69

Is it a minus or a plus
Does enough equal enough
If you can't do the math
Then nothing adds up
Tell me why I'm here

Sure I want someone to understand
But I don't need the stress
I'm not about being analyzed
Like it's some kind of test

Don't have to be a genius
To figure what's between us

[Chorus]

You can spend your whole life analyzing
Justifying, quantifying, and dividing
'Till there's nothin' anymore
Why don't you just close you eyes
And kiss my lips and let it go
Just let it flow
It's what I'm waiting for

Don't have to be a genius
To figure what's between us

Hilary Duff,"I've been so wrapped up in my warm cocoon
But something's happening, things are changing soon
I'm pushing the edge, feeling it crack
And once I get out, there's no turning back

Watching the butterfly go towards the sun
I wonder what I will become

Metamorphosis
Whatever this is
Whatever I'm going through
Come on and give me a kiss
Come on, I insist
I'll be something new
A metamorphosis

Things are different now when I walk by
You start to sweat and you don't know why
It gets me nervous but it makes me calm
To see life all around me moving on

Watching the butterfly go towards the sun
I wonder what I will become

Whatever this is
Whatever I'm going through
Come on and give me a kiss
Come on, I insist
I'll be something new

Every day is a new sensation
Alteration, modification
An incarnation, celebration
Every day is a new equation
Every day is a revelation

You can act real tough (if you wanna)

You can shine.
Forget about the reasons why you can in life.
And start to try
'Cause it's your time
Time to fly.

All your worries, leave them somewhere else.
Find a dream you can follow.
Reach for something when there's nothing left.
And the world's feeling hollow.

Both hands on the wheel, how am I supposed to feel, so much running through my mind
First you want to be free, now you say you need me, giving mixed signals and signs
It's so hard to let you in, thinking you might slam the breaks again

Put the pedal down, heading outta town, gotta make a getaway
The traffic in my brain's driving me insane, this is more than I can take
You tell me that you love me first
Then throw your heart into reverse
I've gotta get away

I can't keep coming back to you every time you're in the mood
To whisper something sweet in my ear
It's so hard to move on, 'cause every time I think you're gone
You show up in my rear view mirror

Is this just a detour, 'cause I gotta be sure that you really mean what you say
It's so hard to let you in, thinking you might slam the breaks again

Put the pedal down, heading outta town, gotta make a getaway
The traffic in my brain's driving me insane, this is more than I can take
You tell me that you love me first
Then throw your heart into reverse
I've gotta get away

To a place where I can be redefined
Where you're out of sight, and you're out of mind

Here I am again talking to myself sitting at a red light

Because you wish you were someone else
You look so clean but you spread your dirt
As if you think that words don't hurt

You build up walls no one can climb
The things you do should be a crime
You're the queen of superficiality
Keep your lies out of my reality
And when you're nice it's just a pose
You're one of those

Haters, traitors to the human race,
Haters, what a drag, what a waste
I'd like to see them disappear, they don't belong anywhere
Haters, haters

Spinning a web that's hard to see
Of envy green and jealousy
Feeling angry but you don't know why
Why don't you look me in the eye
You want my friends, you want my clothes
You're one of those

Haters, traitors to the human race,
Haters, what a drag, what a waste
I'd like to see them disappear, they don't belong anywhere
Haters, haters

Different life forms, different species
Broken promises and treaties
Talkin' about exterminating
Not the haters, just the hating

You say you're boyfriend's sweet and kind
But you still got your eyes on mine
You're best friend's got her eyes on yours
It all goes on behind closed doors
And when you're nice it's just a pose
You're one of those

Haters, trying to steal the human race
Haters, what a drag, what a waste
I'd like to see them disappear, they don't belong anywhere
Haters, later for the alibis
Haters, any shape, any size
I'd like to see them disappear, they don't belong anywhere

Losing the day as if it doesn't really matter

I'm as bad as it can get and good as it can be

There's so many things I am

I am special
I am beautiful
I am wonderful, and powerful, unstoppable
Sometimes I'm miserable
Sometimes I'm pitiful
But that's so typical of all the things I am

I'm someone filled with self-belief, I'm haunted by self-doubt
I've got all the answers, I've got nothing figured out

Downside up, and upside down
Going fast is going slow
What could've been we'll never know

In this place that has no name
I can't remember why I came
Then I hear you whisper low
One more mile to Jericho

Nothing is ever what it seems
When you live inside your dreams

The walls will tumble, the walls will tumble
But I'm not gonna cry
My heart won't crumble, my heart won't crumble
If we ever say goodbye

Everybody gets the joke
Where's the fire, where's the smoke
Money, love and jealousy
Something's got a hold on me

But I will follow where you go
One more mile to Jericho

The walls will tumble, the walls will tumble
But I'm not gonna cry
My heart won't crumble, my heart won't crumble
If we ever say goodbye

Goodbye now, goodbye
One more mile, one more kiss
One more word, one more wish

And I will save us, this I know
From this place called Jericho

The walls will tumble, the walls will tumble
But I'm not gonna cry
My heart won't crumble, my heart won't crumble
If we ever say goodbye

Hilary Duff,"Everybody wants something that seems too hard to get
So I sit here on the street in Venice, waiting for the sun to set
Watching people live their lives, wondering what it means
Sometimes getting what you want is easier than it seems

I don't want to save the day
I just want to get my way and

Rock this world, read my lips and watch 'em curl
Rock this world, it don't take much to please this girl
I don't need the glitter, don't believe the hype
You might say I'm the simple type
Like any other girl who wants to rock this world

Everybody's gone somewhere, so why don't you and I
We're all part of the same parade, just people passing by
And anything can happen, when the sun goes down like this
Maybe it's just a miracle when you find some happiness

I don't want to save the day
I just want to get my way and

Rock this world, read my lips and watch 'em curl
Rock this world, it don't take much to please this girl
I don't need the glitter, don't believe the hype

Light me up, make me feel alive

The sound of your voice, well it fills my eyes
With tears of joy, 'cause I know you'll be there
When I'm hangin' by a thread

Oh, I found myself and ran away
But something pulled me back
The voice of reason I forgot I had

All I know is you're not here to say
What you always used to say
But it's written in the sky tonight

So I won't give up, no I won't break down
Sooner than it seems life turns around
And I will be strong even if it all goes wrong
When I'm standing in the dark I'll still believe
Someone's watching over me

I've seen that ray of light
And it's shining on my destiny
Shining all the time, and I won't be afraid
To follow everywhere it's taking me

All I know is yesterday is gone
And right now I belong
To this moment, to my dreams

So I won't give up, no I won't break down
Sooner than it seems life turns around
And I will be strong even if it all goes wrong
When I'm standing in the dark I'll still believe
Someone's watching over me

It doesn't matter what people say
And it doesn't matter how long it takes
Believe in yourself and you'll fly high
And it only matters how true you are
Be true to yourself and follow your heart

So I won't give up, no I won't break down
Sooner than it seems life turns around
And I will be strong even if it all goes wrong
When I'm standing in the dark I'll still believe

So I won't give up, no I won't break down
Sooner than it seems life turns around
And I will be strong even if it all goes wrong

And I don't have a clue how to get off of it
But when I look at you there is hope
Cause I can see the sadness steal our eyes
You need to read between the lines
You could be the one to hold me when I want to cry

Underneath this smile my world is slowly caving in
All the while I'm hanging on 'cause that is all I know
Could you be the one to save me
From every bad habit that has helped me dig this hole I've been hiding down for miles
Underneath this smile, yeah

I have walked this Earth with broken bones
I've been keeping secrets under all these lies
But when you're around my defenses go
And you don't let me run away from you
You don't let me twist and turn the truth
It feels as if I'm naked while you're standing in the room

Underneath this smile my world is slowly caving in
All the while I'm hanging on instead of letting go
Could you be the one to save me

Let's just get into your car
And go baby go

(So) Why not
Take a crazy chance
Why not
Do a crazy dance
If you lose the moment

Oh
I could be the one for you
Oh yeah
Maybe yes, maybe no
Oh
It could be the thing to do
What I'm saying is
You gotta let me know

Ah ay yeah ay yeah ah ee ay yeah
Ah ay yeah ay yeah ah ee ay yeah

You'll never get to heaven
Or even to a lane
If you don't believe there's a way

Why not
Take a star from the sky
Why not
Spread your wings and fly
It may take a little
Or it might take a lot
But why not
Why not

Hilary Duff,"I can't believe it's really you
Been so long
You look good
I hear you're doing really well
Don't ask me
Let me tell you how I been since when you left
Since you left me for dead
Finally every tear has dried
I've wiped you
From my life

Do you remember all the times you said you'll call me?
'Cause I remember all the reasons people want me
And now I hear you saying that you still adore me
But if you think I'd ever get with you again
Than you can just...

[Chorus]
Love me, love me, feed the flame
If you want me back again
Burn to the sky
Higher and higher
Baby, can you play with fire?

(Burn to the sky)
Love me, love me
(Burn to the sky)
If you want me

You never know just what'd you got till it's gone
You freak out
But I'm not falling for that game
Boys like you never change
You made me feel I wasn't enough, wasn't enough
For your love
But it was insecurity that made you run
It wasn't me

So, don't you sit there trying to give me more excuses
I don't have time for this

I'm off to play in Houston
And I'm too busy with a million things I'm doing
You can't make up for what you've done
You still try to be the one

[Chorus]

(Burn to the sky)
Love me, love me
(Burn to the sky)
If you want me

Oh, by the way, by the way
I found someone
Who gives me space
Keeps me safe
Makes me sane
Found someone to take your place
I am safe
In his arms
And I decided that only he can play with fire

[Chorus]

(It's really you)
Love me, love me

If you want me

Hilary Duff,"You can call it what you want
But I'm not playing games
We're both apart of the same story
Not on the same page
And I see you standing there
With that dirty little stare
Well, it freaks me out inside
So, maybe you should just beware

My love is not up for negotiation
""Hello"" doesn't mean an open invitation
Don't take it personally 'cause
You and me will know
So, move on
Move on
Move on

Now, I'm not saying you're not nice
Let me give you some advice
There's a girl across the room
Who'd kill to be with you tonight
She's been looking over here
And she's made it pretty clear
So, don't lose your chance with her
By trying to get so damn near me

My love is not up for negotiation
""Hello"" doesn't mean an open invitation
Don't take it personally 'cause
You and me will know
So, move on
Move on
Move on

Oh, here he comes
He never gets the hints
Never gets the hints
That I've given him
Oh, there he goes
He's never gonna win
Never gonna win
He doesn't even know who he's trying to get with

My love is not up for negotiation
""Hello"" doesn't mean an open invitation
Don't take it personally 'cause
You and me will know

Hilary Duff,"What's wrong with me?
I get lonely in a crowd
Everyone is smiling
But I made myself left out

I got an imaginary shield around me
But nobody's ever really getting through
I keep thinking that they're gonna break me free
But they never do (no)

When somebody's knockin'
When somebody wants me
When somebody's trying to love me completely
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me
Or will I get burned?
Don't wanna get burned

Is there thickness in the air
Or are you heavy on my heart?
Why can't I just fit in?
Why can't I do what everyone else does?

People come around like a storm
When you least expect them to
For me I run for cover
When I should really face the truth

When somebody's knockin'
When somebody wants me
When somebody's trying to love me completely
I get scared
Don't know how it works
Will somebody save me
Or will I get burned?
Don't wanna get burned

Hilary Duff,"Were you born in '74?
Are you the kind of guy that I should ignore?
Will you give me all the things I need?
You probably never wear your heart on your sleeve
You intrigue me like no one before
It may be wrong to get to know you more
But I'm not sure
I'm so unsure

Cause I see danger, danger, danger in your eyes
Cause danger, danger, danger you disguise
So, baby, lift your head up to the light
There's danger in those eyes
There's danger in your eyes

You belong to my darker side
You're a guy who sets a girl on fire
I can see myself falling in line
Like the hundred girls you had over time
And I want more
I am so sure
That I want more
I am so sure

[Chorus]
Cause I see danger, danger, danger in your eyes
Cause danger, danger, danger you disguise
So, baby, lift your head up to the light (danger in your eyes)
There's danger in those eyes

I'm smarter than this
And know better than this
Cause there's something really missing in your kiss
I'm smarter than this
And know I'm better than this
But there's something that you got that is tough to resist
It's tough to resist

You got those Jimmy Choo's (you got it)
You never get the blues
It's always all about you (we got it, we got it)

Wake up late
No time to waste
Better check that phone
There's a club too close

Where's your, where's your, where's your dignity?
I think you lost it in the Hollywood Hills
Where's your, where's your, where's your dignity?
Can't buy respect, but you can pick up the bill
Pick it up, pick it up, so you got it, so you got it
Pick it up, pick it up 'cause money makes your world go 'round
(Money makes your world go round)

Always with Mr. Right (right now)
But then you have a fight (he's out)
Run into your friend's ex
He's happy to be your next (She won't mind, she won't mind)

Tomorrow's papers
Comin' out
So kiss him fast
Watch the cameras flash

Where's your, where's your, where's your dignity?
I think you lost it in the Hollywood Hills
Where's your, where's your, where's your dignity?
Can't buy respect, but you can pick up the bill
Pick it up, pick it up, so you got it, so you got it
Pick it up, pick it up 'cause money makes your world go 'round
(Money makes your world go round)

You'd show up to the opening of an envelope
Why!
Does everybody care about where you go?

It's not news when you got a new bag
It's not news when somebody slaps you
It's not news when you're lookin' your best
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, give it a rest

Hilary Duff,"I'm at the grocery store and there you are, just watching me
Pick up my clothes from the cleaners and look who I see
I try to lose you in my car
But you won't go away
Come on, buddy, don't you think you've overstayed your stay?
Don't you have better things to do with your life
Than hang around and stare at me, and complicate mine?
Your eyes must burn so bad 'cause you haven't blinked
You and me will never be

Oh, you're such a dreamer
But I'm not a believer in
All the things that you dream
Stop watching me
Stop watching me

I go to bed, and I wake up
Isn't that interesting?
I brush my teeth, and feed my dogs
Isn't that thrilling?

Hilary Duff,"The battle of France is over
Congratulations, you've joined the ranks of all the rest

Was it her face that invaded your mind?
Her kind isn't that hard to find
She lets you think that you found her first

She can swallow lives

Brought the night of your demise

Talks with a grin 'cause she's got no shame
Enjoyed the fame, bringing down the family name

Hilary Duff,"I understand why you're looking for tears in my eyes
Trust me, they were there but now the well has run dry
I was in so deep I couldn't get out
I sat on feelings that I buried deep down
I knew there'd come a day when our paths would cross
And I'm glad it's today 'cause now I am strong

I'm happy, and I can thank myself
If it were up to you, I'd be in my bed crying
But I'm happy, and I know that makes you sad
After all the things you put me through
I'm finally getting over you

I'm happy
I'm happy

There's a reason why we met, and I'm glad that we did, yeah, yeah
But when we broke up, I got back a part of me I really missed
Not saying that you brought me down all the time
There were moments I lived without light on my side

I'm happy, and I can thank myself
If it were up to you, I'd be in my bed crying
But I'm happy, and I know that makes you sad
After all the things you put me through

And I only wish you someone who can do what I can't

Maybe we should sit and finally talk

You wanna know why I look sad and lonely
You wanna know why I can barely talk, well
It's not your fault, so let me say I'm sorry
For making you the reason for my fall

I was riding high, but now I'm feeling so low
I wish that you could make my world feel better
And take away the hurt so I won't be so far gone (yeah)

They float their way through days
And never feel the gray
And their tears fall
But they don't sing
Their typical merry marks
Not always from the heart
They live lightly
It's so easy
No digging in
To what's within

No work, all play
What a mistake
Let the clouds roll in and fill the sky
Get that melancholy feel inside, and
Work on yourself
Don't run from the pain you felt
You don't have to slide
Life's not one big high

Sometimes it's hard looking at yourself
You'd rather place the blame
Than point it your own way
I still do hide from my feelings myself
But I'm trying hard these days
Not to procrastinate
And face my fate
Stay on my case

No work, all play
What a mistake
Let the clouds roll in and fill the sky
Get that melancholy feel inside, and
Work on yourself
Don't run from the pain you felt
You don't have to slide
Life's not one big high

No one is perfect
No one's the same
We've all got problems
That we haven't faced
The challenges, well
They'll make you strong
Don't put them off for too long

You gotta know yourself
To be yourself
You gotta do it all the way
You gotta know yourself
To be yourself
It's a struggle everyday
You gotta know yourself to be yourself
You gotta do it all the way
And it's a struggle everyday

No work, all play
What a mistake
Let the clouds roll in and fill the sky
Get that melancholy feel inside, and
Work on yourself
Don't run from the pain you felt
You don't have to slide
Life's not one big high

Let the clouds roll in and fill the sky
Get that melancholy feel inside, and

You gotta do it all the way
You gotta know yourself to be yourself

You're not the person that I once knew
Are you scared to let them know it's you?
If they could only see you like I do
Then they would see a stranger too

Did I ever do anything that was this cruel to you?
Did I ever make you wonder who was standing in the room?
You made yourself look perfect in every way
So, when this goes down, I'm the one that will be blamed
Your plan is working, so you can just walk away
Baby, your secret's safe

Give me a DJ,
Play me a record,
Forget what they say,

Cause I need to go,
Need to getaway tonight,

[Bridge]
I put my makeup on a Saturday night,
I try to make it happen,
Try to make it alright,
I know I make mistakes,
I'm living life day to day,
It's never really easy but it's OK,

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up on a Saturday night,
Could be New York,
Maybe Hollywood and Vine,
London, Paris, maybe Tokyo,
There's something going on anywhere I go tonight,
Tonight, yeah tonight,

The city's restless,
It's all around me,
People, emotions,
Sick of all the same routines,
And they need to go,
They need to getaway, tonight,

I put my makeup on a Saturday night,
I try to make it happen,
Try to make it alright,
I know I make mistakes,
I'm living life day to day,
It's never really easy but it's OK,

[Chorus]

People all around, 
Everywhere that you go,
People all around you,
They don't really know you,
Everybody's watching like it's some kind of show,
Everybody's watching they don't really know you now,
(They don't really know you, they don't really know you)
And forever

Wake up, wake up,
Wake up, wake up,

Wake up, wake up on a Saturday night,
Could be New York,
Maybe Hollywood and Vine,

There's something going on anywhere I go,

To the beat of my
To the beat of my heart

I'm thinking about,
Letting it out.
I wanna give in,
I wanna go out.
Been looking around
I've finally found,
The rhythm of love,
The feeling of sound.
It's making a change,

The feeling is strange.
It's coming right back.
Right back in my range.
Not worried about anything else,
I'm waking up

I'm making it back,
I'm not gonna drown.
I'm taking a stance.
I won't miss a chance.
I want you to see
I'm not scared to dance.

The way that you feel
Could never be real.
I want you to know I finished the deal.
So I'm sayin' to you
I'll always be true.

Hilary Duff,"Let's go back
Back to the beginning
Back to when the earth, the sun, the stars all aligned

Cause perfect didn't feel so perfect
Trying to fit a square into a circle
Was my life
I defy

Let the rain fall down
And wake my dreams
Let it wash away
My sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder
I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean,
I'm coming clean

I'm shedding
Shedding every color
Trying to find a pigment of truth
Beneath my skin

'Cause different
Doesn't feel so different
And going out is better
Then always staying in
Feel the wind

Let the rain fall down
And wake my dreams
Let it wash away
My sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder
I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean,
I'm coming clean

I'm coming clean
Let the rain fall
Let the rain fall
I'm coming clean
Coming clean
Coming clean

Hilary Duff,"I remember summers, you and me lasting forever
Holidays come and we'd never, never ever be apart
I remember spending, all of my time, every minute
The two of us we had our own rhythm, in tune with the beat of my heart

Now in the summer (I miss you)
And in the winter (I miss you)
It don't matter (what I do)
Since you went away, since you went away
Now in the summer (I miss you)
And in the winter (I miss you)
It don't matter what I do
It don't matter what I say
You left it

You took a holiday from us
Took a trip and left your love
If your heart wasn't down forever
You should have told me where it was
You took a holiday from me
I guess you needed to be free
Would have loved you with no measure
And now you got me asking

[Chorus]
Where (where did you go huh?, where did you go huh?)
Where (where did you go huh?, where did you go huh?) did you go?
(Where did you go huh?) Where did my heart go?
You took a holiday
Where (where did you go huh?, where did you go huh?)
Where (where did you go huh?, where did you go huh?) did you go?
Why did you leave?
This ain't no holiday for me

Walkin', watching you leave there's no talking
Back in my arms it's so shocking, guess forever was just a dream
I think we could have made it, but our history now is fading
My image of the future is changing & baby damn that thing called destiny, got the best of me

Now in the summer (I miss you)
And in the winter (I miss you)
It don't matter what I do
It don't matter what I say
You left it

You took a holiday from us
Took a trip & left your love
If your heart wasn't down forever
You should have told me where it was
You took a holiday from me
I guess you needed to be free
Would have loved you with no measure
And now you got me asking

[Chorus]

If I could take a step back, make it turn out different
I would hide those bags, and I'd tear that ticket
Never thought you and me would be done in a minute
Now I'm making new plans and you?re just not in it

If I could take a step back, make it turn out different
I would hide those bags, and I'd tear that ticket
Never thought you and me would be done in a minute
Now I'm making new plans and you're just not in it
(Where did you go?)

You took a Holiday from us
Took a trip and left your love
If your heart went down forever
Should've told me where it was
You took a Holiday from me

Would have loved you with no measure

Hilary Duff,"Hot sweats in cold sweaters
I feel a little lost since you've been gone
The blame helps you feel better
Until you run across the cloud I'm on

You're reaching for a hand that's in the past
And beaches where the sand has turned to glass
Your television life couldn't channel this love

You can't put your arms around a memory
You can't put your arms around a memory
And now I'm wishing you were here
As much as I wish you would disappear
So will you remember to forget me?
You can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)
Can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)
And will you remember to forget me?
You can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)

A life boat in dead water
A ship inside, a battle that we broke
And we lost our true colours
We opened every door until we closed

And I could feel you in my air tonight
Coming through the waves in satellites
But our city skies will never light up

You can't put your arms around a memory
You can't put your arms around a memory
And now I'm wishing you were here
As much as I wish you would disappear
So will you remember to forget me?
You can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)
Can't put your arms around a memory (a memory)
Can't put your arms around a memory

And I play alone
Round and round we go but we never know
When we should get off

And we both tried, but that's just life
And now come to an end
The tears have dried, made up my mind
And know I'm ready to begin

Gotta let go even though I'm scared to death
I'm here alone, but I still got one thing left
I got a brave heart
I got a brave heart
I got a brave heart

I guess the safer play would've been to stay
Just make your world
But the other side is calling me tonight even though it hurts
And we both try the best that's life and now
Come to an end

And I'm ready to begin

Gotta let go
Even though I'm scared to death
I'm here alone, but still got one thing left

I don't know, know, where we're going
I can't breath, breath, all fading starts
I don't know, know, where we're heading
Just know, know, you're stealing my heart

I wouldn't change a single page of my history
I'm gonna keep all the letters you wrote to me
Each and every day it's the same old game
And I play alone
Round and round we go
But we never know
When we should get off

But you need to hear me now
Call it a warning sign or a caption
But there's walls that won't back down

I'm wide awake
And I swore I wouldn't dream
When I hear you say
That you won't let go of me

I'm slipping under
Soon as I'd thought never again
Oh no, no, no, no

If I fall
You better catch me
You're turning me
Into confetti

You're turning me
Into confetti
I'm free-falling through all of the twilight
Every piece of me holds on for daylight
You freak out
You side-affect me

You gotta away of here
And maybe there's a chance you can't resist
So you set your sails to my winds, waiting
Till the water starts to shake

Have you moved on, moved on?

So am I
Sit right here where it's dry

Standing outside
Of town
In the rain
Well this night is almost over

We would just stay up all night

I just need a little time (so what?)
I'm supposed to be OK
When we're nowhere close to fine? (nuh-uh)

But it only makes it worse (you-ooh)
Hurt me more, you don't care

Hilary Duff,"Half-dressed, sunrise
Late night, your eyes
Heartbeat, your bed
Sound out what we said

Drink after drink, watch you lean into me
I stare at the floor, bring our eyes up to me
It's all I don't know, your words make me weak
I'm new from the start, you've taken me

It's not how I pictured this
It's better than it
But we regret the things we said
Picture it getting better than this
Let it live inside our head
Let our hearts cross the line, it's time
I pictured this, it's better than it
Let's leave it where we'll both be missed

Cold cheeks, warm touch
The taste of your tongue
Low lights, your hands
Night time, our time

Kiss after kiss as we lay in the sheets
If heaven is real, then how does it dream?
It's all I don't know, your words make me weak
I'm new from the start, you've taken me

It's not how I pictured this
It's better than it
But we regret the things we said
Picture it getting better than this
Let it live inside our head
Let our hearts cross the line, it's time
I pictured this, it's better than it
Let's leave it where we'll both be missed

Blurry eyed and tongue tied
Tripping over landmines
Gettin' lost in your mind
Tripping over landlines
Hands creep down my waist
Little slower, now
Hands creep down my waist
Let me show you how

It's not how I pictured this
It's better than it
But we regret the things we said
Picture it getting better than this
Let it live inside our head
Let our hearts cross the line, it's time

Hilary Duff,"I can’t hear a single word
Just know you’re talking
'Cause your lips keep moving
Everything I thought I learned
Goes out the window
All I want is one thing

You can promise castles, treasures, babies
I don't care
'Cause for now you're just enough for me
I want you near
Like a fairytale to feel your breath right on my neck
You remember what I love so baby take me back

Turn the lights down low and kiss me in the dark
'Cause when you're touching me baby I see sparks
You make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go

Ticking tocking like a bomb
Throws me back when I had you closer
Skin to skin we get it on
Without the love I feel you going bolder

You can promise castles, treasures, babies
I don't care
'Cause for now you're just enough for me
I want you near
Like a fairytale to feel your breath right on my neck
You remember what I love so baby take me back

Turn the lights down low and kiss me in the dark
'Cause when you're touching me baby I see sparks
You make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go

Take it all off
Want every inch of you
Traveling back in time
Tangled uptight
Just like we used to
Now do that thing I like

Left them by the sea
Holding onto things
We don't really need
Our edges used to
Fit together perfectly
Why does something good
Always start to bleed?

Hurting, hearts go wild
Bruised girl, broken down
Praised you, many times
One big lie
Passion, washed away
Fake it, fate today
Please give up
And just say goodbye

Stay in love
Give me a reason
Holding on just for the weekend
Crave a world worth better breath in
Stay in love
Give me a reason
Do you remember when I said I'd die for you?
Every a single day that pretend true
You remember wanna say I'd die for you
Holding on just for the weekend

All this said and done
All the fights I've fought
Trapped each, other end
Waiting to get caught
Two words sitting in the air is all we got
Baby I love you, but we need to break up

Bruised up, broken down

All the pleasure I have found in showing you
The different ways

And changing shade

Melodies that must fly
Memories that must fade
Dusty and forgotten by and by

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And he never seems to notice

Wouldn't you agree, baby, you and me got  a groovy kind of love.
We got a groovy kind of love.
 
Any time you want to you can turn me on to anything you want to. 
Any time at all.
When I taste your lips 
Oh, I start to shiver can't control the quivering inside.
 
Wouldn't you  agree, baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love.
We got a groovy kind of love.
 
When I'm in your arms nothing seems to matter 
If the world would shatter I don't care.

Hill-Wiltschinsky Guitar Duo,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere"
Hill-Wiltschinsky Guitar Duo,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Will color all my dreams

Hill-Wiltschinsky Guitar Duo,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",The Windmills of Your Mind

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

And where I'm going, oh goodbye don't mean a thing
There's gonna be some things I miss

Hilltop Hoods,"
This is recreation, set your station, and get your place in
A comfy seat, pump this beat, Pressure will set the occasion,
For your entertainment I work hard on my flows,
This scene is full of falling MCs I wear hardhats to shows,
And every hip hop head's a critic, 'cause some hit the stage hard,
But couldn't get these arseholes open at a gay bar,
It's a comedy festival; they're so unintelligible,
Can't work out if they got peas for brains, or they're just vegetables,
It's sounds pathetic as me being anorexic,
I do damage like a paralytic, paramedic with no anaesthetic,
Girls shake my hand, guys want to hug me it's a worry,
If I forgot your name I'm sorry, you're probably pretty ugly,
I'm scared of getting old, so when it comes D-Day,
I'm a thank you all for dissing me, then say something clichéd,
And when I'm dead and buried I want you in 'Life Be In It' shirts,
At my cemetery singingâ?¦


Hilltop Hoods and we're coming up,
So step on up if you're dumb enough
Hilltop Hoods and we're coming up,
So step on up if you're dumb enough.


People chant the chorus when they hear it, Yo it's on,
You rise like a tsunami, when you feel it; it's the bomb,
I'll make origami of your lyrics,
Geez that's good Suffa, what is it? It's a swan,
I got the shit to bomb MCs back to the Stone Age,
On stage, I'll get you out your seat quicker than road rage,
I take them all from beat jackers to backpackers,
With tracks fat as fuck, I ran amok on these wak rappers,
But then it happened. What happened? What I thought could,
I screwed all these MCs, yeah? Then it got awkward,
It got weird didn't itâ?¦
You don't wanna see me anymore,
Oi Suffa you can't sing, yeah I can't even hum a tune,
But I make this crowd bounce like bedsprings on a honeymoon,
Come and do your best but it's still not good enough,
Suff is rough I'm with theâ?¦


Hilltop hoods and we're coming up,
So step on up if you are dumb enough,
Hilltop hoods and we're coming up,
So step on up if you are dumb enough.


From the hilltops in the Andes, to the Rockies in Canada,
We infecting mics like Tommy did Pamela,
They gassed in the head, that trash you said was pure jealousy,
Like 'Left Foot, Right Foot's an invitation to step to me,
You're loosing you footing, you need some Velcro on them Shell toes,
In fights I'm throwing rhymes, in rhyme fights I'm throwing elbows,
I move a crowd like stolen goods, so try and get a hold when,
You couldn't move your shit with a diuretic colon,
I already told them, the hills are impassable, impossible,
The truth hurts; this rhyme will put you in hospital,
Break it down like a molecule, we burning like fossil fuel,
I'm something of a phenomenon - I'm phenomenal,
These rappers they don't wanna fuck with Suff,
You better turn off your mic, unless you're dumb enough,
'cause we're running up on stage from night until the sun is up,
So run amok you're with theâ?¦

Write rhymes to get me through a break up, bitch!
Rather whiskey straight, no chaser,
Went through fifty breaks, no flavor,
Till I found this one, and made the,
Bass hook with the drum, my savior,
This is the comeback, tongue that's sharp like a thumbtack,
It's so tight James is saying give my funk back,

Toys I'm the Apache, you're failing to match me,
Throw your hands in the air like you're hailing a taxi,

Lads, if you're heading to the bar grab your mates one,
Ladies come chill, come rock with me honey,
I got like half a mill in monopoly money,
There's no stopping me honey, so you can take my hand,
We can lay on the beach and count grains of sand,
Or take a plane to Japan, and drink saki with mafia,
Fly to Libya for some Bacardi with Gaddafi a
Dinner date, followed by a funk show,
We'll rip off our tops and jump around in the front row.

Hilltop Hoods,"Verse 1 â?? Suffa
I was granted an audience in the devils maze,
I sat by his throne and we talked for days,
He told me about his ancient battles with arch-angels,
He told me loneliness was the torture most painful,
He said if I filled my lifetime with sin,
I could earn myself a seat that was right by him,
And if I didn't, that was fine by him,
'cause everyday a million souls just fly right in,
He could barely keep up with the souls of all the people,
It's not easy being sole controller of all evil,
He said â??So many people want to burn with me,
I swear free wills a bitch and so's eternity,
So what you learn from me might save you from suffering,
You don't want to see the bowels of the earth rupturing,
Take a breath, suck it in, I got more to tell,
And time's of no consequence when you're in hell.â??

Verse 2 â?? Suffa
I had a lot a questions;
I asked the devil to explain
Why I always think that people have it in for me?
And why I always feel like the sky's closing in on me?
This is what he said,
Â??The sky's not falling it's just angels committing suicide,
'cause they're so saddened by humans using genocide,
As a political tool, considering all you humans have,
The way you act belittles you all,
Now hell is so full that we started expanding,
Damnation is a business and the markets demanding.â??
I asked him if a city street buckled and cracked,
And hell rose to earth then would heaven collapse?
He smiled; I knew that smile was his response,
I thought to myself, he's almost got what he wants,
He said â??I'll tell you my one desire,
That's for earth itself to become my empire,
Every politicians like a gun for hire.
Even the church of nativity's come under fire,
So you can tell I'm getting close to my goal,
Of creating a world where I can torture every soul.â??

Chorus
Sitting with the devil, this is what I learned,
Apart from the ways a human soul can be burned,
It's that though we learn from our mistakes we're condemned,
To make those same mistakes again and again,
Sitting with the devil, this is what I learned,
Apart from the ways a human soul can be burned,
It's that though we learn from our mistakes we're condemned,
To make those same mistakes
Again and again,
Again and again,
Again and again,

again and again.

And Time keeps, time keeps slipping away,
Like I keep, I keep slipping away,
My time keeps, time keeps slipping away,
Like I keep, I keep slipping away,
My time keeps, time keeps slipping away,
Like I keep, I keep slipping away,
My time keeps, time keeps slipping away,
Like I keep, Like I keep -

I keep slipping away, I keep slipping away...



",An Audience with the Devil
Hilltop Hoods,"Introduction â?? Trials
We have a whole lot of superstars on this stage here tonight,
And I want you to know one thing, this isâ?¦

Verse 1 â?? Suffa
Hilltop, that's where the blood runs,
Thick, it's where kings bury there loved ones,
Sick, kids guard their crop with a slug gun,
From rips, move like Schapelle on a drug run,
So quick, there's kids in the park waiting,
These are my poison diaries like Mark Latham,
So start hating, though you know in your heart,
We've been owning this art since our flow in the park.

Verse 2 â?? Mortar
You can't serve me like Serena and Venus,
Comparatively I leave you looking like the machinist,
Cats know they've been hit, when I spike the mic level,
And draw blood like intravenous,
Without a pencil I'm hell bent,
Leave dents in the condenser, you can tell when,
Mortar's been in the booth to rhyme,
I don't scratch vinyl, I scratch up the mic with my canines.

Verse 3 â?? Trials and Sesta
Mr Trials, young ladies jump in the sack,
I never kiss and tell instead I fuck it and brag,
I'm an angry drunk when I'm grabbing a rum,
And skull shots till we fall from grace like Eric Clapton's son,
South of the country, west of the city,
Chip into that kitty if we're going to be drinking until the skank pretty,
Will he attack? When he snap, got the track like,
Bring it back, hear him rap? Isn't that Funkoars?
You can find us staggered in a cipher,
Turning human traffic to a five car pile up,
We leave them all for dead,
I used to think big till it killed L, Pun, Smalls and Kev,
Like bad move, got you looking like you're eavesdropping the devil,
And T set the theme to send them to hell,
Bet on it, you're never better, I tell them again,
Seddy bury every adversary he put against.

Verse 4 â?? Hau
Fresh off the boat with an impressive approach,
To writing rhymes like pressing your throat,
The unquestionable dopeness, and oh yes,
It's the one and only, in the house like the gun is on me
Got you gronks saying blimey he's clever,
He's brighter than that sun in the shiniest of weather,
Girls you want diamonds forever?
Well throw your hymens the sky if you feel the vibe.

Verse 5 â?? Drapht
None of gravities properties are on top of me,
Can't hold me back from taking a stab like Chopper Read,
Can't hold me back, I'm back around again like stalkers,
My mic holds a force like a sword or a tomahawk,
To Conan, walking with no man now,
'cause you freeze when you spit like a snow mans mouth,
Arouse with every word, first you've got to know this,
We don't belong together like Rove and showbiz.

Chorus
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you,
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you.

Verse 6 â?? Vents
The saga begin, RPM drama again,
My lung burn, dangerous carcinogen,
Starving like Stalin in parliament in Prague again,
In camouflage targeting,
In Rock Creek Park, carve terror in the bark,
Blueprint, build pyramids in the dark,
The blood run deep, renegade creep,
Hilltop connect bro, centigrade heat.

Verse 7 â?? Muphin and Pegz
Muph, some give me shit for my name,
But I don't give a shit about you shit for brains,
Been a long while so I know the game,
It's more about music than your clothing range,
We're here to overtake, setting the standard,
Obese crew, we're the devilish family,
Stand on stage accepting a Grammy,
For the most incredible rapping since edible panties,
Unforgettable pansies in a flickering fit,
Knickers in a twist in a spiral of shit,
Undeniable gift with decipherable spits,
My fireball pit will burn you Muppets,
True rugged, blue blooded dignitary,
Crews love it when we do something visionary,
Move up never lose touch, living ready,
This is the hard road cargo hitting heavy.

Verse 8 â?? Robby Balboa
Robby Balboa bless the text,
Deliver you ticket to death,
Rivers of rhythm ripping the flesh,
Triple your bets on the primitive pest,
Selling sick smut from the cinema steps,
It begins with a breath, a kid killing his pets,
Just sitting in debt when I'm feeling a wreck,
Life's a bitch and so we're wringing her neck,
Fuck a metro in a pink shirt 'cause we're kicking the set.

Verse 9 â?? Honz
The Funkoars and the Hilltop, yes, we still rocking it,
And I ain't going near your bill unless we fucking topping it,
I drink till I'm all over the shop like barcodes,
And as far as rap goes, I've mastered my flows,
Certified and we back again to wreak havoc,
With these pads and pens so understand my friend,
We about to take over just like Hove spit it,
To the most gifted get them glasses up and toast with us.

Verse 10 â?? Pressure
Pressure MC, born with a mechanical mind,
The talent of rhyme, instinctual like animal kind,
Now I flow with the best, from east coast to the west,
We live in the flesh like my raps sewn in your chest,
You can't fathom the dopest flow, amateurs don't you know,
What ever happened to a good old fashioned broken nose?
Don't become a casualty of my faculty,
Damn I got spine but you'll never see the back of me.

Chorus
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you,
And we what? â?? Run with crew,
Whose what? â?? Blood is blue,
Through life's â?? Fucking zoo,
And we might â?? Come for you.



",The Blue Blooded
Hilltop Hoods,"In life, we struggle as individuals
A fine line between a cliché saying and something original
As if in death we left something residual
Behind to mark our time up in this pitiful
Existence and i’m a man of many issues
If I ever dissed you, no disrespect I never wished to
Hold a grudge the stress makes me act like this
The day I get it off my chest I won’t write tracks like this
But i’ll be bitter on them when all is done and is forgotten
Cos it’s easier to sit and complain than fix the problem
But the power of speech endowers our beliefs
With sour defeats, man nothing is out of reach
Got plenty to answer for, all do is answered back
Done a thousand things I regret, apologize for none of that
So you get back what you put in no regrets
And keep on until they know your sweat, you only get

(we get)one chance, so I live for the moment
I’m just one man what I wouldn’t give for this moment
We got one world; still we take it in stride
In this one life we stand still waiting to die
(we get)one chance, so I live for the moment
I’m just one man what I wouldn’t give for this moment
We got one world, still we take it in stride
In this one life we stand still waiting to die
Now breathe in

Now if life is what you make it it’s time to build
Man I’m for real ain't no telling what this life will yield
I’m a career man, cos I career off any path
That would lead me to a start of financial gains I’m scarred
We learn from our mistakes, that makes me a scholar on
Being a walking talking fuck up and a better man for being wrong
I’m humble and loyal, my friendships are honored
A mans success ain't measured by the depths of his pocket
I give good advice but never follow it, what’s left for me
I’m a hypocrite and if I weren’t I’d be a success story
View this wide world through a narrow gaze, these harrowed days
Seen to many men end in a shallow grave
I guess it’s better to have loved and to lost, than never stumbled across
The gift of knowing you what ever the fucking cost
To put it in perspective and under my vision
This world is superficial, I’m done with others opinions

(we get)one chance, so I live for the moment
I’m just one man what I wouldn’t give for this moment
We got one world, still we take it in stride
In this one life we stand still waiting to die
(we get)one chance, so I live for the moment
I’m just one man what I wouldn’t give for this moment
We got one world; still we take it in stride
In this one life we stand still waiting to die
Now breathe out",Breathe
Hilltop Hoods,"Verse 1 â?? Suffa
I got to jump back and kiss myself,
The Hoods have comeback to rip this girl,
Live on the drum track you dissed yourself,
So drunk that you nearly pissed yourself,
And if you come wak you risk your health,
I'm the one that made LL ring the bells,
Sharp as a thumb tack, it's the infidel,
In the back with some girl named Isabelle,
And I'm a, you're gonna what? I'm a wreck this, the freshest,
Thermoelectrics, technics and a set list,
So check this, Hilltop locks jaws like tetanus,
Fuck breakfast at Tiffanies I want Tiffany for breakfast,
The funk leader, told you last LP,
With a style that make you smile like a Chelsea,
Smile, what the fucks that man? It's when you place,
Razor blades on the cheeks then a kick to the face,
In the place and we raising the roof,
Like Al Qaeda had placed a case in the booth,
A taste of the truth and some flawless shit,
Like John Howard knows the taste of George's dick,
Man I'm born to spit these kids wish they stuck me,
I warn you kid you're bitch made like puppies,
Switch blade to Nazis' cut them through their khakis,
I lose it every time I put it down like car keys.

Verse 2 â?? Pressure
It only takes one man to bust,
But takes these two to raise them standards up,
Take three, Debris man the cuts,
This is for, those that will stand with us,
From sundown into the dawn didn't I warn?
The lyrical storm hits you in a physical form,
This isn't your norm, didn't reform, isn't your average,
Wishing to score listeners for pitiful crap it's,
Off Richter, sicker than cough fits you,
Listen to pop hits? This isn't your soft shit you,
All in the mix so start warning the kids,
They're adopted and not that they were born with a gift,
I'm so fatal that reverends won't stay till confession,
You all can't hold your own like post natal depression,
I've got a mouth of profanity, a spouse and a family,
At my house man no wonder that I'm doubting my sanity,
I'm an honest drunk, what a mentality,
Avoiding the truth is staying sober; I'm an addict of reality,
I live for tomorrow so cheating death today,
Means at all costs avoid repeating yesterday,
I'm a loose cannon, enough juice to soothe famine,
Break your back with this rap then ask you who's slamming?
Some rapper claiming a throne, unaware they,
Ain't kings only royalty they know is airplay



",Circuit Breaker
Hilltop Hoods,"I’m from the city of light, with a sky of vanilla
Known as the city of churches home of the serial killer
And in the summer it feels like a hundred degrees
Where i’m from you might see suffa mc
Walking the traps trying to escape the map
Ninety one was my shit i’m trying to take it back
To when writers ran the line and transits ran the gambit
My memories the paint, let the track be my canvas
Thirteen sitting in a park, sipping wine casks
Watching whole cars as they went flying past
I couldn’t paint so I rhymed to the writers
They’d laugh, light up a smoke, and get blinded by their lighters
‘nasty arts’ ran my line evading cop cars
And we looked up to them like they were rock stars
Paint stained hands and fame like Manson
That’s Charles not Marilyn, a city held to ransom
Cans and markers, country road parkers
Hands of an artist left the landscape enchanted
Until the government pigs had all the paint washed
From our city walls, end of the renaissance
And so the walls where the colors once played
Were replaced by the buff, now a sullen blunt grey
White washed, shitty, all grey, all black
Waiting for the kids of this city to take their walls back

I’m from the city of light, with a sky of vanilla
Known as the city of churches home of the serial killer
And in the winter, the city sleeps dead in the freeze
Where i’m from you might see pressure mc
Walking the traps trying to escape the map
Ninety three was my shit i’m trying to take it back
Got kicked out of school but I would have left in time
With nothing but an ego and rap to get me by
I swept floors, packed orders, when poor racked from porters
Liquor store just to score me a four track recorder
Fifteen, sneaking in the back door to the gig
Thought I could rip, bro trust me I fought for this shit
Cos the city’s darker than a starless night
And treats a starter like a fresh piece of meat, greet the carving knife
Till the day came when i’d scar consortiums
I’d lay waiting, train stations and parks my audience
Before we had our beats made, before we had a dj
We’d rock to a beat box, before that shit was clichéd
You see mate, I refused to lay low and gave those
Better years of my life to pave roads
Live as hell, we did it by ourselves
The only secret to this shit is one that time will tell
So breathe in cos the city invites, jealously, pity and blight

Of the Craigieburn projects,

In the arms I'll lick ya spirit with my miracle web, web
'Cause what I'm hearing's all shed
On the lyrical tip
Na, I ain't feeling ya kid

But it wasn't no thing, like Bobby,
Gave Whitney a rock but it wasn't no ring (Drinks Party)
And I'm a keep at 'em, crossing my fingers as Eve
Says, keep at 'em, I'm going down on Louise
And I'm a reek havoc
Little man with a big pen
I got dirty habits like a nun in a pig pen

Only think type bro, betcha at my shows dressed in several of your wife's clothes
An arrogant fucker

If I married ya mother ya still wouldn't be half of me
You should run from me
Fuck battaling, ain't nothing sweet,
'Cause I won't beat ya to the punch I'll punch ya to the beat
Don't get offended by the rubbish that we pump in the street

Back in the days when I was a teenager



",Clown Prince
Hilltop Hoods,"Let’s get introductions aside,
Pressure, Omni and Suffa tonight busting the mic like,
Lately I’ve been hearing nothing but hype,
Pen’s mightier than your sword? Then you’d be fucked in a fight,
From the point of the exact conception I’ve had perfection,
And you ain't close to Omni even though you may lack direction,
I've got a good heart, but bad intentions,
Pressure don’t need a map for reference I’m a man of legends,
I’ll last forever like bad impressions,
Like the first night you cursed in adolescence,
The way I slam a sentence can panic veterans,
Some things are better left unsaid like anything that I have to mention,
My loud mouths my downfall it’s doubtful,
I’ll bite off more than I can chew 'cause I already got a mouthful,
Act like I astound y'all, well I’m a scoundrel,
With enemies but cliché is a friend of me, I’m out yall.

[Chorus]
Pull up a chair, and kick your feet on the table,
Let down you hair, lean back in your seat if you’re able,
We’ve got the Jazz, for your speakeasy conversations,
It’s the universal language of relaxation.

The heart of the giant, the eye of the lion,
The smell of victory is what makes me keep trying,
My will to survive is like I’m stranded on an island,
I keep rhyming; keep climbing till somebody find me,
My city’s been behind me since the mid nineties,
Right around the time when it was cool to be grimy,
My DJ used to make the earth spin in reverse,
Put the needle to the dirt, spread the word like you heard it first,
Now it’s all twisted, somebody told the truth but they missed it,
I put it on my CD but they skipped it,
But that’s what happens when you do something different,
Some people can just stay content with the simple shit,
I live my life fast like it’s my last,
I don’t trip off of cash or dwell in the past,
I’m bigger than that I’m bigger than rap,
One of the sickest MCs on the map for bringing that back.

[Chorus]

Pull up a chair, and kick your feet on the table,
Let down you hair, lean back in your seat if you’re able,
We've got the Jazz, for your speakeasy conversations,
It’s the universal language of relaxation.

I heard there ain’t no party like an open bar,
We lay out rhymes like drinks for a broken heart,
Heartbreak like liquor in an open scar,
So bizarre, roll thick like smokers tar,
Tell me who can rock parties with no guitar,
And if I ain't getting paid then I’m leaving in the promoters car,
Tell me who you know this far,
Gone, on till the moments
Gone, on till the break of this governments back,
And it’s on till my mates are all loving the tracks,
No thugs in his raps, no muggings and macks,
And no guns, just trying to get us up on the map,
Bust, Suffa on wax, trust it’s on,
I’m trying to do for rhyme what digital cameras did for porn,
Born in a small town, die with a big mouth,
Hoods tore it all down, shouts to the kids south.

[Chorus]

Pull up a chair, and kick your feet on the table,
Let down you hair, lean back in your seat if you’re able,
We've got the Jazz, for your speakeasy conversations,
It’s the universal language of relaxation,
Pull up a chair, and kick your feet on the table,
Let down you hair, lean back in your seat if you’re able,
We've got the Jazz, for your speakeasy conversations,
It’s the universal language of relaxation,
Pull up a chair, and kick your feet on the table,
Let down you hair, lean back in your seat if you’re able,
We’ve got the Jazz, for your speakeasy conversations,
It’s the universal language of relaxation,
Pull up a chair, and kick your feet on the table,
Let down you hair, lean back in your seat if you’re able,
We’ve got the Jazz, for your speakeasy conversations,

Hilltop Hoods,"Going down the hard road,
Don't know where I've been, we're going down
Going down the hard road,
Don't know where I've been

Growing up I needed a guide like, a blind veteran's dog,
Cause I was going nowhere like a child's letters to god,
Though life's road was hard I was never so lost,
That I looked for an answer in a medicine box,
I never did pop pills, or cop deals, just rocked hills
Kids with skills, still got harassed by the cops till,
They'd have me in the back of a paddy, down to lock up,
Smack me, pat me down for a baggy, mums would rock up,

And bail me out, a failure out once again,
Next weekend, bailed me out, drunk again,
And I never will forgive myself, for putting you through all that hell,

I went from high school dropout to factory laborer,
Slave to the clock until four, went from sleeping on the floor,
To being back on tour, now no stopping me,
I'll finish with a bang like Kurt Cobain's biography

[Chorus]
Going down the hard road, down the hard road,
Don't know where I've been, and don't know where to go its like,
Going down the hard road, down the hard road,
Don't know where I've been

I spent my youth like life was cheap,
The only change that I wanted was enough to buy a drink,
Was on a path nowhere, the harder the road,
The more broken baggage we carry the larger the load,
This school drop-out got knocked out, chased by the cops out,
Got clout, dumped by my girlfriend and locked out,
Been broke and beaten, even chocked at being,
A dope MC but never lost hope in dreaming,

We used to thrash boosted cars till the engine would fail,
If I never had bailed I'd be dead or in jail,
And man I got no one else to blame
I thank my family and music for keeping me sane,

But that's the breaks right? Started working late nights,
Never seeing daylight, getting paid like a slave might,
And I've done too many years to miss this for my missus,
To have to tell my son he nearly never existed

[Chorus]

Dj Debris c'mon and break it down like,

And I speak what I feel in the booth in the spirit of truth,
Cause all these kids that I meet man they mirror my youth,
And I could have gone the wrong way, the easy option,
But I chose to go the long way, the streets are watching,

So keep a look out, look up, B-ballers keep your hook up,
Tear a page from my book out, and pull out,
Your finger put your foot out and keep a lookout,
For what we put out, the brand new flavor for your cookout

[Chorus]

Hilltop Hoods,"Verse 1 â?? Suffa
You sound like a bitch man,
Nymphos in your clip and disco riffs man,
I'll tell you this, OK, it don't fit man,
It's like OJ, little glove, big hand,
Step to this I'll take your miss, make her twist and,
Moan, like I fucked with the pitch man,
This land where the bricks stand,
On red sands, I spit grams of powdered Difflam,
To ease your muscle pain, do the hustle,
Came to tussle against the corporate gain man,
Parcels move train to plane in the struggle,
Markers give a claim to fame in the jungle,
Street revolutionaries, we the evolutionary,
Anomalies, but stupidly they try stopping me,
That's only making me a martyr we,
Like opiates in the vein, attack the arteries,
Don't get smart with me; I got a heart in me,
Like Pharlap, and gone so far raps now a part of me,
I got camaraderie, the great unwashed,
I got a heart in me that pump's straight up scotch,
But crews still try to diss me, till I switch it on em,
Like they try to diss Fats, till they see a picture of him,
Big boys, ain't small man, they tall and,
Ugly, want to cut me come join and join the monsters ball man.

Verse 2 â?? Pressure
These are the last of days, a vast array,
Of fake fucks up in a masquerade,
It's swim or drown, we act we don't sink,
Its primal instinct we rap we don't think,
Its do or die, no turning back like suicide,
Till you're doing time with these cut throats in a suit and tie,
So don't feed the animals, or act a fool,
Your just one man, a young lamb amongst a pack of wolves,
So while you're fighting over scraps and loose change and moot claims,
Pressures higher up in the food chain,
And small time predators rove in packs,
That why big time executives throw them scraps,
So much static that this is such a hazardous business,
And having to witness that half these rappers are bitches,
Got me laughing hysterically, I've the heart of a pedigree,
So pissing on the next man is just marking my territory,
Rivals will claim over head strong beef,
And try, fighting for fame on these slept on streets,
While I'm, signing my name in the wet concrete,
Touching both sides of your brain when I flex on beats,
And when we sound the drums, I'll see cowards hung,
When my hour comes I'd rather catch a beat down than run,
It's just that honest, I don't rap for these monsters,
Id rather face the music than turn my back on you.




",Monsters Ball
Hilltop Hoods,"Verse 1 â?? Mystro
Well I'm the one to bring the funk although my armpit's not stinking,
And I'm known to hold flows like the glass you drop drinking,
Never crude man I started of limping,
Plus I rock a fella like I know the art of parking lot pimping yeah,
You people know of Mys, the one whose flow's crazy,
And is so gravy that it should come with a bowl of rice,
The MBS with the Hilltop Hoods,
Make be-Boys and Girls break quicker than real soft wood, let's go.

Verse 2 â?? Pressure
I never hit on a girl, at least with no hand,
Girls are like serving time but time waits on no man,
Got nothing on women so I spread love on the rhythm,
And get you out your seat quicker than corrupt politicians,
And I'm on the brink, man it makes me stop and think,
I don't drink till I drop 'cause I think I might drop my drink,
Think you're more, than us? We believe in war,
Trust me your nothing I ain't seen before.

Verse 3 â?? Braintax
With one pen too high to overextend,
In dreamland with freedom starting again,
With foresight thrive on the magic of life,
And five fingers plus a mic make sick shit, Braintax,
Fuck Tony Blair like I hate George Bush,
Another seven day week, you ready for the push?
Through the eight million stories that you can't write down,
Start again from the top, come on people bounce.

Verse 4 â?? Suffa
Man all these pollies in power are cowards so it's only fair,
That I hate John Howard like I hate Tony Blair,
And I croon like Tony Bennet in a rental tux,
Experimental cuts, with the Brando Flux and Mys Diggy,
No one's as fly as these kings,
I'll leave you beside yourself like Siamese twins,
We're so deep, so nice, so full of promise,
But obese, lowlifes man what woman would want us?
We're like some hooded up bombers out storming the yard,
We're going large like a junkie out pawning his car,
This is the core of the art, and it's all from the heart,
This music put your life together when it's falling apart.




",Obese Lowlifes
Hilltop Hoods,"Pressure (x6)
It's the next chapter, where's all my head at?
You slept at the fact that we crept back to,
Set factors straight, the only dead rappers,
Are penned at the papes of no cred actors,
Those haters, no you don't phase us,
'cause you don't know shit so, you're on a need to know basis,
And those gracious folk with no status,
I made this flow for you, no your own name is,
Not a part of the bigger picture, listen it's the,
Middle finger that you put up in a fist yeah,
Life's a bitch and it'll hit you,
If I could pimp women like I do words I'd be living a little richer,
Hip Hop's a circus act this is absurd but fact,
One critic or cynic for every that learned to rap,
One lyric with gimmick for every with purpose that,
Furthered rap culture round the earth and back,
But some diss but when I'm up in your face,
You're a man of your word; you got nothing to say,
I got respect for the scene and love for the place,
Where I bled for my dreams and struggled for change,
We're still striving on, were still alive and strong,
Right or wrong I'd still kill for where I belong,
Insightful on the real deal when I write a song,
Question, you still feel the vibe I'm on?

Verse 2 Suffa
I had the whole crowd like, oh shit, that's right I said it,
I'll be like, da, da, da, da, roll like the credits,
Two of the best to ever edit poetics,
It be the three headed beast from Obese come to set it,
Off, Hilltop in the place, sir just calm down,
Spit fire on stage and burn your bar down,
You hear it bumping in clubs you turn your car round,
You hear it pumping in pubs you buy the bar a round,
Pump it up in your car; turn your car into a club,
Smash through the wall of a pub and burn the bar down,
Just burn the bar down, like a disco inferno,
MCs aren't the only thing we burn though,
I'm the arsonist like Rakim is,
So ask your kids who the number one artist is,
Obese got the mad fucking roster while,
Your crew couldn't even house a foster child,
You're flamboyant like Oscar Wilde, I got to smile,
When you panic on stage like you lost a child,
Where's Benny? Benny's across the road watching Hilltop,
'cause they got the flow the hills have still got,
The skills, the beats to get nice on,
Don't need drugs, I get a buzz when the mics on,
So hit the floods Suffa like it with the lights on,
Hilltop, we're what's left when the vibe's gone.
",Recapturing the Vibe
Hilltop Hoods,"Early morn, train station, aching from the arthritis
This war veteran knows what a hard time is
He needs his pension, dementia and half blind is
The reason he rides the train with no car license
So he boards with an expired ticket has a swipe
Gets a fine cos the change he got don't add up right
We're taking about a man who never lived a lavish life
Caught up in the age of computer chips and satellites
A lovely lady boards looking tired and half awake
He smiles, she's reminds him of his wife that past away
She says something as she walks right past his way
His old hearing aid don't last quite half the day
Some young gentlemen alive with their laughter
Approach the old timer and put a knife to his heart to
Explain that money or bloods the price of their barter
To a man whose friends probably died for their fathers

[Chorus:]
Whatever it takes can justify
Whatever ends we make, whatever the price
To the end of a life, it?s just an observation
So take a ride we?re stopping all stations

It's been a long night the suns lifting on a cold
Morning but she's drugged and drunk tripping on her stroll
On the way home, she's done with stripping on a pole
But she can't pay for her son living on the dole
Jumps a train puts on her gloves she's wearing black
Being watched by some old mug she's glaring back
She's on edge and got the bug from sharing smack
So she says, Hey, what the fuck you staring at??
He smiles, an unsteady hand rubs on his dome
She takes a seat, a messy band of ruffs board alone
To the digger with a machete at his lungs and he's prone
He can barely stand but ready to stand up for his own
She tries to help him she doesn't choose to flee the car
And catches a blow with enough bruise to leave a scar
She starts fainting, the rooms moving and seeing stars
Ain't it amazing how courageous human beings are?

[Chorus:]

He knows nothing but toil, strife and hard yakka
Pissed at the world for playing wife in a slammer
This man was never given a life on a damn platter
So he jumps a train with knife and bandanna
Boys at his back, sleazy, hardened and far
From giving a fuck, an easy target his mark
He sees an old man and says ""See we'll part with your hard
Earned cash or rest in peace we can start with your heart""
Some girl steps not afraid she's gonna cop it sweet
And gets decked before she made it even on her feet
The old man leaped to her aid and to his horror he'd
Thrusted his chest into the blade of his robbers piece
He grabbed the wallet, dropped the knife as he fled the car
Concerned about the loss of life he'd never went this far
What's done is done, he'd got the prize and he'd spent his half
Of two dollars in change and a pension card

So put your hands up if you're not to drunk to stand up
If you bombing up the toilets put your man up
And put your can up spray it in the air mate
Check out my man, fuck its all going pear shaped
They call me Suff when I'm drunk they call me fuck off
Head under the bar trying to drink the run off

Fall into a trance and there ain't no climbing back
Sit and lose myself in all the hidden loops

This scene is on fire, feeding my bleeding desire,
So when P?s behind the wheel indeed you?ll need to retire cause I?m a,

Mocking you miniatures, more props than Bollywood cinema,
Last call, me and P will be drunk all summer,
Jim Carey, Jeff Daniels, call us drunk and dumber,
People are starving and they?re putting Lamborghini doors,
On a fucking Hummer? Give some to the funky drummer,
And I?ll ride this beat like a drunken lover with no fucking rubber,
And I fucking love her,
Girl don?t leave me,
I need you and see that you don?t need me,
But if you leave me alone,
You?ll break my heart, I?ll fall apart and lose my seat on the throne,
Like an opera,
A tragedy like an opera

Hilltop Hoods,"Standing in line, fifteen couldn’t wait
Couldn’t fathom any talent in rhyme
Had to get mine, granted in mind
Was my rapping that I thought would never happen in time
Odds stacked to reject us, attacking the hecklers
Reckless with rap till they had to respect us
Laid tracks, never asked for jack for my efforts
Cause everything we do comes back to affect us
And as long as I got lungs I’m a say this
Long as we get love we got some that will hate us
We’ll never change it’s done for the faithless
I don’t care for favorites on somebody’s play list
Ain't enough paper for the names I gotta mention
Without them, no way I would of made it a profession
I wouldn’t trade it for a day of my obsession
We’re staying dedicated to perfection

It’s been so long, we’re glad we came
Before we gathered fame or had a name
Our story hasn’t changed with accolades
We’re still standing and we’ll be back again

I’m still standing, fuck it, one of us had to
Though I’m not standing still like a statue
Man, I can tighten loops like a lasso
You see my blood runs blue like a cut up a tattoo
It’s ironic, some say it’s even confusing
That I’m still standing cos I’m keeping it moving
And I’m still champion we keep on improving
And I’m Main Source man, I’m breaking and moving atoms
What we spit is absurd
Since a kid, I’ve always loved the rhythm of words
The beauty of language, and spewing the anguish
All over the canvas like the riff was a curb
Now if you live by the word then you die the pen
The critics can criticise but we’re the crème dele crème
Me and P-Dela we blend what they’re calling the standard
Still standing while they’re screaming when will it end?

It’s been so long, we’re glad we came
Before we gathered fame or had a name
Our story hasn’t changed with accolades

Hilltop Hoods,"Verse 1: Pressure
I've been earning my stripes, 
Till I'm perfect when I'm working the mic,
And I've been serving the type of words that murder insights,
This ain't an urge it's for life, what I recite furthers the fight,
A service for the circus that occurs in the night,
So put your money where your mouth is, we're doing it now,
Golden Era's let loose on the prowl, loosen the noose of your doubts,
We're here to take back what used to be ours,
So make your last words count like grooms choosing their vows,
It's more than just timing, the sport of slaughter with rhyming,
Of course if I'm writing my name upon your corpse it's a signing,
There's hoards of them vibing, smiling at the thought of us dying,
The water that's rising ain't the shore it's more of your crying,
Jealous cause we striving and inspired by truths,
They know nothing bout surviving with the times and the news,
And whole image is a lie and didn't like that my crews,
Got our own sneaker, feel free to walk a mile in my shoes,
Hip Hop's in hard times if it's said, that time is money,
Then I've been paying dues until I hit the red,
Is it dead, or is it just the picture which your fed?
Write rhymes with your heart and do your business with your head,
If you ever bought Pressure a beer, let it be clear,
It was a blessing but I'm stressing I'll be dead in a year,
Forgetting my fears for the blood, sweat and tears,
F a career, I'll be left with the respect of my peers

Chorus:
What we're doing here is crazy,
Super Official with the style,
What we're doing here is crazy,
If you ain't up on this, then you ain't up on shit,
Super Official with the style,

Verse 2: Suffa
Girl for one night, we'll get drunk right, 
And we'll get tongue tied, till we puke together, (vomits)
Bitch, Big Lebowski, that rug tied the room together,
Howl at the moon together like Ozzy Osbourne on tour,
In Rio with Ronny James Dio on the encore,
They want a Funkoar, they wanna hold a mirror,
To ninety-four, they want a golden era,
They wanna golden shower so I'm a give 'em,
Sid Vicious, spit vicious, you can't cut me off like circumcision,
That's just how I'm living so adjust how you listen,
To the music, the new shit can't be touched now I'm driven,
Ain't the same old, lame old take it in the a-hole,
Payola, payroll, dude shut your cakehole,
This is soul like watching some day old,
Paint on a train roll by as the rain fall,
And it's so beautiful it's painful, a sweet sickness,
Like picturing the rest of your life with a girl you've known,
For three minutes, and proposing in a day and a half,
What we're composing here's state of the art,
It weighs heavy on your brow like a crown of thorns,
And that's when we break it down man sound the horns,
Now reborn, work hard, eat lunch in the car,
But we play hard, Braveheart drunk in a bar,
We're here so take heart, we're making music that's honest,
The movements upon us like some rebels moving through in the forest,
Carrying a torch to burn Babylon,
For every musician a label ever put a saddle on

Chorus:
What we're doing here is crazy,
Super Official with the style,

Hilltop Hoods,"I'm wondering where the day went
The clouds have me shrouded in grey but
I'm still out pounding the pavement, word
Drowning the hurt by pounding rounds in brown paper
Founded a label now I'm drowning paperwork
But now the crew I'm down with found an escape from work
And I love it 'cause that what your hard work gets you
My heart bursts through my chest I'm rescued
So forget what the rest do
I'm blessed to do it with two of who are the best to do it
Do I love it?

Look at our goals
If we never stood in the cold we wouldn't evolve
Used to put my crooked foot in what I couldn't resolve
But took control now, hard work is good for my soul
And I love it, growing through life and stress
Knowing the fight is just half of self-imposing our righteousness
Contract owners and licenses, showbiz in lights we're just
Searching for that moment of pricelessness

B-Boys, I met you at the bus stop
We had nothing but the tuck shop
We had school ties, the sky and the hilltops
Now we're all grown up and it's still about Hip Hop
I love it, I love it

Five days deep in the booth, and spent Friday leaping through loops
Then spent the weekend sideways, seeking the truth
And I won't lie they keep me on my toes these days
But I won't lie, hey I beat 'em with the flow for days
'Cause I love it, a pen and pads like a red rag to a bull
I see red like Leningrad
Raising a crowd from a vacant lot's like, like how
Raising a brow on the face of god right? Right now

And I love it a life with no regret
No success without a price that owes a debt
I roll the dice and despite the road ahead
Hope that in a crisis I might just know the ledge
But I love it like take away beer
And a sunset to lay away our day-to-day fears
See haters under rates us but this status takes years
And it ain't where we're at; it's how we made our way here

B-Boys, I met you at the bus stop
We had nothing but the tuck shop
We had school ties, the sky and the hilltops
Now we're all grown up and it's still about Hip Hop
I love it, I love it

And we can be in a hotel, worst part of town and
Support act, we ain't half as loud but
Twice as nice you can ask the crowd then
We passing out in a departure lounge and
I love it, I hug the road like an old friend
Like the world won't revolve unless we're rolling on it
It holds them on it, it's soul melodic
And oh they want it and I love it

Been chasing the dream
Everyday a new place, new faces and scene
Living out a suitcase few breaks in between
There's been very few days I'd loose faith in my team
Got love far from home through the winter and summer
No matter how hard the road or the distance I cover
Even bitter when I'm missing my significant other
I wouldn't trade it for the world given another
'Cause I love it

Hilltop Hoods,"I lay down my music ten feet from where I lay down
Immersed in them beats, short breaks turned to breakdowns
'Cause when you work where you sleep, you don't sleep
'Cause you work on them beats till it hurts then you creep
Into bed and wake her from her sleep, and she's hurt
'Cause she worked through the week 
And hasn't heard not a word nor a peep
From the jerk that she keeps in her heart
That she forgives when he nurse her to sleep, word it's deep
But yo, when I peel them lids back and emerge from my sleep
I feel so big that I could make a shirt from my sheet
A crown from a church steeple, two Jeeps for my sneaks
So people worship this creep as I surf down the street
I'm the surgeon of beats, your girl purrs when I speak
We rehearse in a church to a circus of freaks
We the last ones to lay down, first on our feet
So stay down or get hurt by what lurks in the deep
Free the perps from the police, we disturbing the peace
We flood the streets like a water main burst and released
A merciless beast with a thirst for the feast
Man we treat every meal like it's our first in a week
We dispersing the weak, I'm the person to beat
Man I'm unbeatable, I can beat a person for weeks
We disturbed, we the freaks, we the ones you don't listen to
Drinking from the sun, now son we're the ones dissing you

And we don't (ever stop), we won't (let it drop)
We don't (ever stop), and we won't 
Let the vultures at the counter-culture
Now we don't (ever stop), and we won't (let it drop)
We move mountains and drink from the sun

We're timeless like riders on the storm
Survivors like the light that rises in the dawn
If crisis makes fighters of the pawns
We rise up through the night as lifeless and we're born
Fight in my heart, suicide with my art
'Till I depart I'ma write until I light up the dark
These are battle songs that lift you from your catatonic fixture
And I can walk on water but I stagger on the liquor
This ain't a Saturday sport or matinee talk
With throwaway sentences like the magistrates' court
Scratch that, now hear me out, attacks don't give me doubt
I drop a powerhouse track black the city out
And when we lose it let the mood of music reach us
Coming through the tunes that free us
Revolution through your speakers
The third rock never stops, the world turns
Eyes glued to the clock as we watch the world burn

And we don't (ever stop), we won't (let it drop)
We don't (ever stop), and we won't 
Let the vultures at the counter-culture
Now we don't (ever stop), and we won't (let it drop)
We move mountains and drink from the sun

Renegades whenever on center stage
That's my sweat upon the letters I bled on the pen and page
C'mon, so what's your rhyming worth? 
Better get a lawyer 'cause
I could crucify your verse just to get a point across
We've been refining and grinding till late night
Why, 'cause even stars lose their shine in the daylight
Linked as one, just think what we'll become

Dropping havoc I’ll rock the planet wild
'Till they shoot me in a movie Hong Kong combatant style
Plastic rapping and disposable culture
Poet or solider, falter and get thrown to the vultures
We wear our scars like a badge of honour sewn in the shoulder
Cross the unknown, rock alone like the coast of Gibraltar
Looking over my shoulder, radio and payola
Keep us alien on air like being flown by Travolta
Flow with a vocal assault of the microphone and controller
Harder to handle than a loaded revolver coated with sulphur

Come on, enough day to day stress of just living
Without giving a fuck if they’re hated just cause you’re different
Let’s do it under the name of the love that became lost
Dress it up how you want, we’re cut from the same cloth

Can’t escape the cage we forge, we’ve got bars to break

A property that you can’t count or measure

The way that other people wanna live, that’s their prerogative

With you, if suddenly I ever have to surrender you
I'd fall in a heap, I'd fall on the floor
And crawl on all fours, for you I'd fall on my sword
If grief ever darkened my door, you'd light it up
The way you brighten up a room hits me right in the chest
It puts the breath inside of my lungs
It's like I lept in the light of the sun
And in spite of my weary frown
You wear a smile that wears me down
So hear me out, I know that I wasted time
When I should've been replacing your last name with mine
And that mistake is mine, believe me
I wear it like a sunburn, it might disappear but it won't leave me
I'll carry you on my shoulders, never set you down
Ferry you through the coldness, never let you down

I won't let you down, won't let you down again
I won't let you down, won't let you down again

Travelling man in the back of a van
Capturing sands like time through the back of my hand
If I could hold her for a moment, do a lap of this land
I'd console you for a moment, then be back in a glance
But I'm so far since we left for the road
Chicks I've seen around the heavens and globe
Searching for the next episode
Problem is, in letting it go
Be like letting go of everything you treasure and know
And whenever I go, I think my chest will explode
No matter where your heart at, brain leaves death in the crew
Try and understand, where I lay my head is my home
And I was in love, before this rap shit was ever in vogue
But if you feel that you're ever alone
While standing in the same room as me
Let's set it in stone
You can't save me, acquainted to this devilish road
But you're bravely willing to give a hell of a go
So

I won't let you down, won't let you down again
I won't let you down, won't let you down again

I hate that I was wasted your touch, your taste
My shame, can't change, want you to remain
My angel, my heartbeat, come closer, I'm sorry
My soul is, yours truly, you know this

And you know that I
Won't be shy, talking bout what you're giving me
Conflict diamond, you shine through the misery
You walk in a room and light it up, that's just with your entry
You walk in a room and light it up, like it was four twenty
Some people never find out what they have
Only ever find out what they had
And I could've been one of them, don't know if I still won't
And that thought hangs around my neck like a millstone
For real though, it's like I lost you, left you, let you go
Before I got to get you, or let you know
That you're my refuge and I need you to see
The only one I let down more than you is me

And I won't let you down, and I won't let you down
I won't let you down, won't let you down again

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

From each shearing end.

Living illusion, 
Straight to the heart. 

I enter, sanctuary, 
They bury, the dead. 

Makes way, for the pain and promise, 
Dawning devotion, 
Numbing all in dismay - Stands alone. 

Lash out, strength in submission, 
Giving to exploits, 
A swift sudden death. 

Swarming, hybrids of exile, 
Outlaws in anthem, 
Sketched even in script.

Of a vacant past.

Translates the quarrel, 
With no objection. 

And issued, Sarcasm and war, 
To this distant boy, 
With more desperate needs.

With the ones who saved my life.

Beat down and bruised

At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know
Cause a bottle of vodka
Still lodged in my head
And some blond gave me nightmares
Think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist I wake up
And French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
Its own beat in my head
While we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and truth
What you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on bed of roses

Step that I takes on my way home

To see through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I just close my eyes and whisper,
Baby blind love is true

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on the bed of roses

The barkeeper's wig's crooked and
She's giving me the eye
Well I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died
Ooh yeah

Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight won't be alone
To know that don't
Mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend

And I sold everything I had
For something
I can't seem to find

When the real world crashes down
Oh if they could see me now
When all the dreams are all your own
Turn to nightmares all alone
It hits you right between the eyes
This is the life
This is the life

These four walls feel more like a prison
Instead of pure highs
I couldn't wait to live in
So I just drink myself to sleep
Again
Can't escape my mind
This ain't like a movie
It's getting hard to hide
The more it's doin' to me
Don't know how long I can keep
I'm going

Maybe that grass ain't so green
Nothings ever out of reach

But love too much to walk away
From this lonely room, waiting for you,

So what do I have to do?

To get me away from you,
Get me away from you.

We broke up, how this happened again?
I always end up letting you in
When I start drinking, not thinking.

I should have listened to all of my friends,
Same road and the same dead end,
I’m loving while she pretends,
So I keep drinking, not thinking.

First love is hard enough
Even worse to give it up,
I can’t forget her when she’s gone
But she can’t leave when I’m holding on.

So what can I say?
I made a mistake,
This time you’ll never change,
You’re nothing but trouble and I should have known better.
It’s always the same,
I’ll take the blame
This time I’ll never change,
You’re nothing but trouble and I should have known better.
Girl, I should have known better.

Every time that I start to forget
I drive at the spot where we first met,
You had nothing on underneath that dress,
We were just drinking, not thinking.

Just two kids, it was way too soon,
Didn’t realize what we had to lose,
No way to know we wouldn’t make it through,
Didn’t know we’ll end up seeking.

Right now I’m losing this fight.

Can’t figure out this loving,
Guess it ain’t happening tonight.

Now I just can’t believe that she won’t talk to me.

Love takes work and work takes time,
Sometimes there ain’t enough Saturday nights,
A way to show it, I thought you'd know it.

I saw you every day but I guess I was blind,
Didn’t know I had to read your mind,
You were on me, I didn’t know it.

Middle of the night and I’m wide awake,
I close my eyes and I hear you say

I should learn to win

I paid the price to control the dice
I'm more precise to the point I'm nice

Unfold, your body is free and behold
Dance till you can't dance, till you can't dance no more
Get off the floor and get a blow
Then come back and upside down
Easy now let me see you move
Next in line groove, work me all night
The music is my life
Ev'ry body dance now
Ev'ry body dance now
Ev'ry body dance now

Ev'rybody, come on let's sweat, baby
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
Sweat, sweat
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you

Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me

For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow

Hip Graffiti,"I get no kick from champagne,
Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

Some get a kick from cocaine,
I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Some get a kick in a plane,
Flying too high,
With some gal in the sky,
Is my idea of nothing to do,

Never meant to make your daughter cry

My baby's drama mama, don't like me
She be doing things like having them boys come from her neighborhood 
To the studio trying to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit you never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

Me and yo' daughter, got's this thing going on
(We got a special kind of thing going on)
You say it's puppy love 
We say it's full grown 
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abacadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation

[Chorus]

Uh, uh, yeah
""Look at the way he treats me"" 
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass home girls 
Done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle 
And ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speaking no more 
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about?  Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, envy and to the G they be the same thing
So who you placing the blame on, you keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on

Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home

Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on

Sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?

Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes

Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town

Shit I ain't choose to rhyme
Rhymin' chose me
So I hit the track runnin'
Like a nosebleed
Life ain't great now
But it's much improved
Yo' album droppin' this summer?
That sucks for you
Cause this is Bubba's moment
I put my mother on it
I said my momma
It seems as if
I love her don't it?
So buckle up, 'cause
It's gon' get bumpy
I call my girlfriends Betty's
And my shits grumpies
That Bubba talk
Gotcha open wide
I giggle outside the booth
But ain't no joke inside
This is complicated
At least to y'all it is
Just let me sell fifty million
Then I'll call it quits
But until that day
Y'all in deep doo doo
I never once saw
You crank it 'cause
I just leap through you
What you need to do
Is just admit you love me
The South has
Always been Dirty
But now it's gettin' ugly

Ugly-in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get
Ugly, ugly, ugly
In here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
Uh-oh

Though I am country
Don't get the wrong idea
My ego's gettin' bigger
With every song I hear
Cause y'all been bullshittin'
Spittin' that booty chatter
Out here for two days and
Came with somethin'
That truly matters
On goes the saga
Of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrah
If I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now
I hate it came to this
How else can I say it
I don't speak
No other languages
I'm fairly ripped now
So this the jimmy talkin'
You hear that beat don'tcha?
That's just Timmy talkin'
Go 'head throw dem bows
Fuck it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us
Will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose
Ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just
Forget what we discussin'
This that new South
Take a picture of me
Cause I'm a fuckin' legend
And this is gettin' ugly

Ugly-in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get
Ugly, ugly, ugly
In here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
Uh-oh

Now this thang is jumpin'
Ain't it somethin'?
What makes it special
This whole moment
Came from nothin'
Now you see it triples
I bet she slurp tonight
Lames hide your wallets
Hatin' broads
Clutch your purses tight
If you ain't tryin' to live
You with the wrong crowd
And if you feelin' brave then
Better sport that thong proud
And if you finally breathin'
Then sing this song loud
I'm glad I got you wet
I know you had a long drought
Don't worry about the law
They can't arrest us all
I had to crank couldn'ta done
Nothin' less for y'all
Forget your inhibitions
I wanna see you whylin'
And if Bubba dies tonight
Know he was smilin'

Ugly-in here
Huh, in here

It's gon' get ugly in here
