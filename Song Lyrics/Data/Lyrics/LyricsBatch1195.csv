Swollen Members,"I'm just too hot to touch you know I'm the law
I smoke about million pounds of dutch and say what
Shortie keep yakking it up and on the low
I might take her to the back to fuck, get a nut
Nice, you cant tell me I ain't came up
Fastball pitcher I deliver with no change up
Fuckin' right I'm famous, balling like the Lakers
Only time I move is to go collect my paper

See me on the wanted poster, Mad and La Coka Nostra
Hop out of my Porsche, pull my trunk and extort ya
Yup we west coast and dog we stay posting
Walk with two toasters Louis Vuitton holsters
I'm a bad fucking bastard yup I'm fantastic
Four but I'm the Silver Surfer flying through your door
Heard you cryin' for the war Im'a try to serve you more
Madchilds a dope man leave you lying on the floor
Damn chicken heads get their feathers all ruffled up
Put the potato on the pound sound muffled up
We can get it on like Samoans and Tongans
Or we can get to war like the angels and mongols

Black mask over my face, I get em
Four-five stuck on my waist, I hit em
Beat a hater up till he dum dum diddum
Swollen and La Coka don't fuck with em

So ladies and ah forget it were not gentlemen
I roll up in a stolen car come hop in with them
Hand me a pill bottle I dump it and pop ten of them
Give me some booze, I sip juice like Rakim and them
I got a fuse that's too short and a noose that's too long
Feeling I could do no wrong
This invincibility they're convinced is killing me
Has essentially gotten me through any pinch you'll ever see
When my henchmen are with me tensions on the scene
Dreams are being changed a wrench in the machine
One mention of the team leave the masses buzzing
The rebel, you thought you're on my level, you wasn't

Hotter than Ecuador, son brought a metaphor
P-1 I'm ready for war I'm on the front lines
Runs in my bloodline thirsty like lost boys
Big money bounce my accounts keep em offshore
Caribbean breeze there's ten million reasons
Y'all super eight like rich we four seasons
Fine linen, sterling silver, Bright Brightlen, the lady killer

Black mask over my face, I get em
Four-five stuck on my waist, I hit em
Beat a hater up till he dum dum diddum
Swollen and La Coka don't fuck with em

I started war and bids when y'all was just kids
Came to your town and jumped the fuck around
Stomped out a few of you and fucked your lady
You still married her and you gave her a baby
We were young, we were crazy, we were wild and free
Ain't a groupie bitch alive get a child from me
And now you come to the shows and you reminisce
And while she waits for an autograph, you give her a kiss
She slips me a hug and a look that's knowing
If I say get on the bus, baby girl its on
Lyrics keep flowing and flowing and just flowing
Hoes keep hoeing and hoeing and just hoeing
Trees get rollin' smoking keep blowing
Coka and Swollen legend keep growing
Fast lane living no time for slowing
Gotta know where you been and watch where you're going

Black mask over my face, I get em
Four-five stuck on my waist, I hit em
Beat a hater up till he dum dum diddum
Swollen and La Coka don't fuck with em",Dumb
Swollen Members,"You ever get the feeling
No matter what they do, no matter what they say
Know you'll make it, some day

[Chorus]
They'll say I'm a killer
I feel I'm as high as I can be
And now they gon' die as high as me
I can't be no realer
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down 
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down 
Y'all ain't gon' bring me down 
I can't be no realer, y'all ain't gon' bring me down

You know the feelin' when your back is up against in the wall
People say that they love you but you ain't convinced at all
Tell 'em they full of shit and they'll tell you you're insecure
Calling you immature, does that make sense to y'all?
You ever feel like it's you against the whole world?
Like everybody is schemin' even your own girl
Your homeboy seem to be countin' your money
Tell 'em you ain't got it and he lookin' at you funny
I'm feeling like I probably need to either leave the game alone
Or either be the G to bang the chrome to get his name known
How does the Saigon story end? How?
Know what they're sayin' for now?

[Chorus]

When Mad Child step on stage, I cause hysteria
Now they won't let my crazy ass back in America
Eagle labeled me as an illegal evil immigrant
I'm far beyond the magic of a wand inside a wizard's fist
Sharper than the hand of Edward Scissors, I'm a wiz at this
Hotter than the desert but I'm colder than a blizzard kid
Harder than a prison bid, with God I'm never hesitant
My business it isn't as amazin' as it's ever been
As long as God allows me to be clever it will never end
Sharpen up my axe and I am back, I'm here to sever heads
Compulsive obsessive, I'm also aggressive
My mouth is the message, my life is a lesson, my pulse is a blessing

[Chorus]

If there's hell below we're all gonna go, yo Curtis Mayfield
God and the devil still tryin' to level the playin' field
Some people sayin' that this life is all about free will
I'd rather have free rent, and never pay these bills
That's why I'm thankful every day that I'm blessed with these skills
And Mad is still alive after swallowin' all those pills
I ride for Saigon, New York to the Hollywood Hills
(The greatest story never told) is now yours to reveal
I feel like helium balloons are stuck up on the ceiling
Trying to make that breakthrough before I catch deflated feelings
Dying with a heart full of regrets is not amazing either
I'll just see the gatekeeper, or you meet the Grim Reaper

[Chorus]",Bring Me Down [Swollen Mix]
Swollen Members,"I'm staring in a mirror but mostly I laugh
I'm looking at the picture of a sociopath
Hope to get first, now hopefully last
Dope rap, I'm known for doing dope in the past
Like floating down the river on a opium boat
But I'm a wild animal I go for the throat
I'm a big bad wolf with a big black Glock
And some real dark thoughts yelling, ""Open the door""
I punch people in the face coming down the staircase
Wander down the hall with the can of bear mace
Aye, I've been a killer since the Wu-Tang Clan
Personality is colorful like Toucan Sam
I'm a crazy cat, Sylvester damn
I got two big guns Yosemite Sam

I used to work birds like Tweety
Speedy, Gonzales living in a palace
Tripped and fell down the rabbit hole and met Alice
Fie years later now I'm back for the challenge
Still rip up shows like Tasmanian Devil
If some punk jump up I'm blasting my heavy metal
And I still live in Van' but I'm moving soon
All my homies on the streets fucking Loony Tunes
But I'll be back, back and forth with no error
Enforcing terror in a Porsche Carrera
Through Vancouver to Los Angeles archangels
Dark strangers, blacks and Caucasians
(Man we crack skulls, make deep lacerations
Crack a Red Bull and drag 'em back to my basement)

[Chorus]
We fly through the air like Iron Man
Crack you in the head with a frying pan
Can't fuck with my team, we are iron clad
I'm on fire man, call the fireman
Whether crawling up the wall like Spider Man
Or lying on the floor popping vitamins
Yup, real hip-hop we supplying fans
We on fire man, call the fireman

All right, I keep my knife in the black leather sheath
Real sharp, blade (Dagger Mouth, armed to the teeth)
I can't draw but I'm raw when I'm drawn to the beat
It's like Saw part I, I'll make you saw off your feet
What the fuck is defeat, I'm undefeated like a shoe store
Runway, one way street, take a detour
Robot, C-3P0, R2-D2
Plastic bag over your face hard to breathe through
Preview attract and download the album
X marks the spot like my first name was Malcolm

Make you sing the blues like a prison in Folsom
Spit a burning ring of fire, watch the flames engulf em
My theory very logical but we use Pro-Tools
Fuck with us you'll be a dead man, a corpse in the sound booth
And ain't nobody hear you, close the door make it soundproof
My pattern very classical like Herringbone and Hounds tooth
I.C.P., R.E.P., bright evil clown suit
Ice cold water in a bottle when I drowned you
Beat side, homicide unit try to find you
Burning sound turn around my dude's right behind you

[Chorus]",Fire
Swollen Members,"[Verse 1: Prevail]
I perforate my verses straight 6 o'clock,
Reverberate the verbs, surround the noun, ground the pound the starting block
Martyrs on the rocks disengaged I threw them over,
Cliffside, from hangman's bluff that's their brains on heavy boulders
Ready the soldier's up, parascope, Red October
Elves and ogres, and hell raisers to focus
On pin head, a thin thread, is what holds your life together
Nas measure anatomy
Take pleasure in the taxidermy
Your raps whack poetic,
You rap whack pathetic,
Leave you in a house of wax like a museum figure deadened
Strike a match, melt a candle,
Blend the ammo with the cammo
Then go [?] with my famo, its like third rail to [?]
Prevail make you read brail
And eat nails, and swallow glass
Remain anonymous like Rass Kass, life's a blast
At total recall, you speak in hallow holograms
My tidal wave [?]

[Hook: Madchild]
We the last of our breed
The actors with masters degrees
I'mma rap to attack and ill feed
The laughter
I capture the last of these thieves
You'll hear laughter
I'm back on my [?]
Master [?]
Dastardly deeds, Inglorious bastards, notorious masters
The last of our breed we are bastards indeed
The last we will smash till you have to believe

[Verse 2: Madchild]
Yeah, I love god,
He has made me very lethal,
Destroy evil, I don't really like people
Never met an animal I didn't like, couldn't bite
Smash a rapper into pieces when I hit a mic
Equip a baseball bat thats full of wooden spikes
Walking down the dim-lit street call me the hooded knight
I drop a match and set a tank full of petroleum
Then moonwalk across Lemoniun, its pandemonium
Battle plan is that of an apache resistance,
Imagining ten dragons with flags in the distance
Skull and double axes
Troubled brother action
Ninjas doing double back flips, on that shit
Social distortion, black flags faction
Bad brained wasted youth have interaction
Punk-rock mind-state, [?] leopard print
Fresh like peppermint, darker than a second tint

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snak The Ripper]
Yeah I'm the product of narcotics
Exotic drugs and [?]
Any social [?] antibiotics
Smoking hydroponics
Bumping ladi-dadi with a 20 year old hottie on my dick doing Pilates
Like [?] on a tricycle, trying to keep up with a Mazerati
Every week catching a body, see me dancing on a cop car
Strapped with C4, screaming out Allah Akbar
I'm not afraid of death I'm more afraid of living slow
So I stay driven till my goal is met, or till I lose control
Nobody can save me I'm completely out my mind
The only ones that doubt me are completely fucking blind

Sworn Enemy,"The days of my past now are so far gone
The glory days when the battles were won
The walking down those hallowed halls
The laughing, the yelling, the ruling it all
As I close my eyes I can plainly see
The lunchroom tables and everybody
The jokes that were made, the fun that was had
And all the trouble we got being bad

But time, time can be so cruel
And play with your mind
And you wish harder for those days to find

Time can be so cruel
And play with your mind
And you wish harder for those days to find

Those days are gone forever!

Life rolls on even as we look back
To those days that were treasured
When fiction was fact
I get the chills when I stop and think
How much time can actually pass between each blink?
When I think of all the things that I did
I feel like now in my heart that I don't even live
Can you feel the warmth as you stop and smile?
Doesn't that call you back every once in a while?
While!

The days of my past now are so far gone
The glory days when the battles were won
The walking down those hallowed halls

The jokes that were made, the fun that was had
And all the trouble we got being bad

Days Past!

My heart races back to the days of the past
In my mind I knew that it wouldn't last
So much to miss, (So much to miss!), So much fun
I spend my days reliving thoughts of all that I've done",Days Past
SWV,"I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way.
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
It's a feeling that I don't understand.

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time,
With thoughts of loving you on my mind.
I can't figure out just what to do,
When the cause and cure is you.

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak.
I lose all control and something takes over me.
In a daze and it's so amazing, it's not a phase.
I want you to stay with me, by my side.
I swallow my pride, your love is so sweet.
It knocks me right off of my feet.
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak.

It's time after time after time I've tried to fight it.
But your love is strong it keeps on holding on.
Resistance is down when you're around, starts fading.
In my condition I don't want to be alone.

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time,
With thoughts of loving you on my mind.
I can't figure out just what to do,
When the cause and cure is you.

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak.
I lose all control and something takes over me.
In a daze and it's so amazing, it's not a phase.
I want you to stay with me, by my side.
I swallow my pride, your love is so sweet.
It knocks me right off of my feet.
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak.

I try hard to fight it.
No way can I deny it.
Your love's so sweet.
It knocks me off my feet.

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak.
I lose all control and something takes over me.
In a daze and it's so amazing, it's not a phase.
I want you to stay with me, by my side.
I swallow my pride, your love is so sweet.
It knocks me right off of my feet.
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak.

I get so weak
Blood starts racing through my veins
I get so weak
Boy it's something I can't explain.
I get so weak
Something 'bout the way you do
The things you do ooh ooh, it
Knocks me right off of my feet,
Off of my feet.
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak.",Weak [A Cappella]
SWV,"Boy, be quite, follow me and tip toe
Don't wanna make too much noise
Sneaking in your window
So pull down the shades

'Cause my neighbors are kind of nosy
Comfy, cosy, now off with the clothes-why
Can I get a witness? Betta fitness
Baby, we can do it, take your time, do it right

Lick my belly button, whisper sweet nothings
In my ear to get my hormones in gear
Now, mamma's little baby loves toast and jam
Melts in your mouth but not in your hand
Black pudd'n

Separates the boys from the men
You can knock all day Jehovah but you can't get in
Maybe you can get a scoop, if you're really all of that
And you can leave your fake fingernails in my back
Now, I may not be a lady but I'm surely all woman
So check it, the proof is in the pudd'n

Can I get a lick? Can I get a lick? What?
Can I get a lick? Can I get a lick? What?
Can I get a lick? Can I get a lick, girl?
I wanna get a taste of your pudd'n

Must be Jell-O, 'cause pudd'n don't jiggle like that
Yeah ain't that a fact, pull out your spoon
And let's begin the mixing, always in the bedroom
Never in the kitchen you can get busy

With your head beneath the blanket
Flip it, spank it, gettin' buck naked 'cause women in the 90's
Want more from a brother than a part-time lover
Who's wack undercover, so brother, do your duty
When it comes to the bedroom, don't let him eat the pudd'n

If he ain't got the head room
So, dip, D I P, dive if you wanna be a diver
Sport a helmet with a light like an old gold miner
No need to taste test the puddn's always fresh
So, brothers, wear a bib if you're gonna make a mess

Can I get my spoon in, no way
Now I eats more pudd'n than old folks play bingo
Parker Lewis can't lose in Santa Domingo
What about Atlanta? [unverified] than Santa
Saturday night, I'm liver than Rose-ana-ana Dan-a
So, Holy Molly
([Unverified])

Can I get my spoon in, no way
Now I eats more pudd'n than old folks play bingo

What about Atlanta? [unverified] than Santa

Can I get a lick? Can I get a lick? What?
Can I get a lick? Can I get a lick? What?
Can I get a lick? Can I get a lick, girl?
I wanna get a taste of your pudd'n

Proof is in the pudd'n, so come get a taste
I know that you love it from the smile on your face
Up and down like a slinky, let's get kinky
The cream in the middle of a Twinkie
'Cause I likes my men cot diesel

And if you're unleaded then nigga, just forget it
You can't rub my back, or kiss my neck either
With you sniffy, sneezy, coughy, achy, stuffy head fever
Undercover lover, in between the sheets
As the bed springs creak, while I rips up the beat

Brothers love the pudd'n like Lucy loves Ricky
Joanie loves Chachi, or Micky loves Minne
But I have getting hickies on my neck in the summer
'Cause wearing a turtle neck is a bummer
I heats up the mike 'til your blood pressure rises

It ain't the kind of pudd'n Bill Cosby advertises
Pull out your spoon, and let us begin
But if you front on the pudd'd
You might not get your spoon in

Some insecurities 
About the way I feel 
Where I want to be

No one can do 
The things you do to me

Long as it's love we're making 
There'll be no hesitating, you and me. 
That's the way it will be 
And I won't leave your side 
You should know...

Right here, be right here

That's just what I'm giving 
I'm gonna keep it strong 
I'll be holding on to you. 

No on can do me like you do, it's true 
Sure as the sun is shining 
Our love will keep on climbing 
There's gonna be some rain, gonna be some pain 

But as long as I know 
Boy, time will show 
Our love will grow, and I know...

It's seems like we're having trouble 
You don't seem to understand 
The life I lead ain't double 

My heart belongs to you, and only you 
And you know it's true 
A phony imitation just won't do 
Relax your mind 

I'm not the kind who runs around 
And wastes time, other fine brothers just don't compare

And the special touch you give comes from you only

Love an experience

It's not always fun,

But it always special,

And builds the future

Is amazing love
Tell me why is love the way it is
Joy and pain is all in the game of love
I don't know

It's hard to say
But who am I to blame
Love is so amazing
How many heartaches

Does it take till this can become the one?
How many tears must I cry till my heart mends?
But as much as I try to get over you
My heart calls for you

Why is love this way?
Does it have to be this way?
So tell me why
Is it me?

Or is it this how love should be?
Tell me why is love

Know that I have to be strong if I want to get over you

You need to find, find someone who's there for you

There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

Every time, every time it rains, it's gonna rain pennies from heaven
Don't you know every cloud contains lots of pennies from heaven
You'll find your fortune's fallin', baby, all over the town
Be sure, be sure that your umbrella is upside down

Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers

Sybersound,"He was working through college on my grandpa's farm
I was thirsting for knowledge and he had a car
I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
When one restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last
Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

I still  remember when thirty was old
And my biggest fear was September when he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste
Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

The fields have grown over now
Years since they've seen the plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've been missing so much

A three car garage, her own credit cards
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss good night
If he could only read her mind, she'd say:

Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
And she can't help but wonder what she's doing wrong
Cause lately she'd try anything to turn his head
Would it make a difference if she said:

Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

And the more that he lives the less that he tries
To show her the love that he hold inside
And the more that she gives the more that he sees
This is a story of  you and me

So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
Opened the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
Cause I'm gonna make things right
I'm gonna hold you tonight

In his beat up pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down
Her mercedes had a flat

He could see that she was frightened
Standing out there in the snow
Till he said I'm here to help you mam
By the way, my name's Joe

She said I'm from st. Louis
And I'm only passing through
I must of seen a hundred cars go by
This is awful nice of you

And closed her trunk
And was about to drive away
She said How much do I owe you

She went in to grab a bite to eat
And then be on her way

But she couldn't help but notice
How the waitress smiled so sweet
And how she must of been 8 months along
And dead on her feet

No she didn't know her story
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her change
From a hundred dollar bill

The lady slipped right out the door
And on a napkin left a note
There were tears in the waitress' eyes
When she read what she wrote

Be too shy, wait to late

Sybersound,"Spent forty-eight dollars last  night at the county fair
I threw out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me saying sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired, if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm gettin' in to deep

But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

My Mama and Daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holding umbrellas and openin' up doors
I'm taking out the trash and I'm sweepin' my floors
Crossin' my fingers, and countin' every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this

But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

Got to wash my truck and dress up
To pick her up to watch TV
And she sits down on the sofa
She'll move a little closer
She can't get enough of me

But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

Sybersound,"An old man turned ninety-eight
He won the lottery and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought, it figures

Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down he thought
""Well, isn't this nice.""
And isn't it ironic,l don't you think

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought, it figures

Well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out when
You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up
In your face

A traffic jam when you're already late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife
And isn't it ironic, don't you think
A little too ironic, and yeah I really do think

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid

That I can do to make you do

That I ought to stick to another man

Spent my nights awake and I wonder
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay

I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

So I cry, I pray, and I beg

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me

Where is my prairie song

How do you take your coffee my sweet

But I couldn't understand a word they said
Not that I was tryin' to be rude
But conversation couldn't make it through

Because I can jus' see your face with mine
I try to change my thoughts; it's a waste of time

Well you know I do my rap thing, I'm holdin' it down
And I knew that me and you was gon' connect some how
Your people called for this track, it ain't no trouble to me
I dreamt that you and me got married on the WB
You on channel 11; I carry the M-11
RJ the reverened; it's a match made in heaven
Whatever have you I let you know
I'm from soundview
Down til I found you
I'm tryin' to be around you
I'm still comin' up
Chasin' the fame and wealth
I could spoil you with time; you got everything else

When I first saw this girl
Thought I wanted to fall
Mean the hummer so stunnin'
That my bod was tense
And I wishin everyday that I was fresh like Prince
Then I came across my man RJ parlayin' in a 6
With Tatyana Ali playin'
I heard Steely Dan ""Black Cow"" and went wild
You tell me how can I get down
That's when they threw me on the redeye to LA
I dirtied my cash and peeps back
And hit Shaq on the cellay

Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry 
What you do to me 
Can't take what you did to me

Sybersound,"VERSE 1
On a warm summers evening, on a train bound for nowhere, I met up with a gambler we were both too tired to sleep. So we took turns at staring out the window at the darkness, till boredom over took us and he began to speak, He sais ""Son I've made a life outta reading peoples faces. Knowing what the cards were byt he way they held their eyes. So if you don't mind me sayin I can see your outta aces for ataste of your whisky I'll give you some advice.""
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow, then he bombed a cigarette and asked me for a light. And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expresion said If your gonna play the game boy you gotta learn to play it right.

CHORUS:
You gotta know when to hold them,
Know when to fold them,
Know when to walk away, know when to run.
You never count your money when your sitting at the table,
There'll be time enough for counting when the dealings done.

VERSE 2
Every gambler knows that the secret to survival is knowing what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
Cause every hands a winner and every hands a loser and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.
And when he finished speaking he turned back towards the window, crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep. 
And somewhere inthe darkness the gambler he broke even. And in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.

Sybersound,"While all the time that I was loving you
You were busy loving yourself
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else
Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids I have nothing to show
Wasted my years a fool of a wife
I shoulda have left your ass a long time ago

Well I'm not gon cry,

No, I'm not gon cry,
It's not the time,
'Cause you're not worth my tears

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side
I shoulda left your ass a thousand times

Well I'm not gon cry,

'Cause you're not worth my tears

I know there are no guarantees
In love you take your chances
But somehow it seems unfair to me
Look at the circumstances
Through sickness and health 'till death do us part
Those were the words that we said from our hearts
So now when you say that you're leaving me
I don't get that part

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet

Sybersound,"Many nights we prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hope for a song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could

There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe

In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer bird
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My hearts so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles
When you believe (When you believe)

Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve)
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see the way, get through the rain
A small but still, resilient voice
Says hope is very near, oh

There can be miracles (Miracles)
When you believe (Boy, when you believe, yeah)
Though hope is frail (Though hope is frail, it's hard)
It's hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh, yeah)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve, oh)
When you believe somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow)
Somehow you will (I know, I know, know)
You will when you believe (When you)
You will when you (You will when you believe)

Sybersound,"Verse One:
(LaTocha):
As I stand here contemplating,
On the right thing to decide.
Will I take the wrong direction,
All my life, where will I go,
What lies ahead of me?
(Tamika):
I have strong determination,
And I'm not afraid of change.
I have yet to find that someone,
Who would care to satisfy me,
To stay right by me.

Chorus:
Who can I run to,
To share this empty space?
Who can I run to,
When I need love?
Who can I run to,
To fill this empty space with laughter?
Who can I run to,
When I need love?

Verse Two:
(Tiny):
And my mind is so confusing,
Who would be that special one?
Everyday I'm trying to find you,
All along, I've got to know,
Is there a place for me?

I know love has many names,
And a message very clear.
All it takes is time and patience,
To bring you near,
But look at me, tell me

Sybersound,"Every morning there's a halo hangin
From the corner of my girlfriend's four post bed
I know it's not mine but I'll see if I can use it for
The weekend or a one-night stand

Couldn't understand
How to work it out
Once again as predicted left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out

Something's got me reeling
Stopped me from believing
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it
Why'know I want to do it again

(Sugar Ray say)
Oh

Oh
(Every Morning when I wake up)
(Shut the door baby, don't say a word)
Oh

(Shut the door baby, Shut the door baby)

Every Morning there's a heartache hanging
From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine and I know she thinks she loves me
But I never can believe what she said

Something so deceiving
When you stop believing
Turn me around again
Said we couldn't do it
Ya know I want to do it again

Oh

Sybersound,"Oh kiss me out of the bearded barley,
Nightly , beside the green, green grass
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
You'll wear those shoes and I will wear that dress

Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift you open hand
Strike up the band, and make the fireflies dance
Silvermoon's sparkling,
So kiss me

Kiss me down by the broken tree house
Swing me , upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring , bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map

Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift you open hand
Strike up the band, and make the fireflies dance
Silvermoon's sparkling,
So kiss me

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home)
She can be 18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

Check, check, yo, I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won't believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why: why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, 'wishing you was' niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty want to knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss
Honies looking all ""they wish"" - come on boo, gimme kiss

I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins

I have no luck
I don't miss it all that much

Sybersound,"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire how about yours
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun

Count the hours they go so slow
I know the sound of your voice
Can save my soul

Look out my window to the world below
Moves so fast and it feels so cold

Don`t let me die
I`m losing my mind
Baby just give me a sign

And now that you`re gone
I just wanna be with you
And I can`t go on
I wanna be with you
Wanna be with you

I can`t sleep and I`m up all night

How about stopping eating when I'm filled up
How about them transparent dangling carrots
How about that ever elusive kudo

Thank you terror
Thank you disillusionment
Thank you frailty
Thank you consequence
Thank you thank you silence

How about me enjoying the moment for once
How about how good it feels to finally forgive you
How about grieving it all one at a time

The moment I got more than I could handle
The moment I jumped off of it was

How about remembering your divinity
How about unabashedly bawling your eyes out
How about not equating death with stopping

Misfit, I sit, lit up, wicked

Sybersound,"It seems like yesterday
But it was long ago
Janey was lovely she was the queen of my nights
There in the darkness with the radio playing low
And the secrets that we shared
The mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove
And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

Against the wind
We were runnin' against the wind
We were young and strong, we were runnin'
Against the wind

The years rolled slowly past
And I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home
And I guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was living to run and running to live
Never worryied about paying or even how much I owed
Moving eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breaking all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searching
Searching for shelter again and again

Against the wind
A little something against the wind
I found myself seeking shelter sgainst the wind

Well those drifter's days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

Against the wind
I'm still runnin' against the wind
I'm older now but still runnin' against the wind
Well I'm older now and still runnin'
Against the wind
Against the wind

Still runnin'
I'm still runnin' against the wind
I'm still runnin'
I'm still runnin' against the wind
Still runnin'
Runnin' against the wind
Runnin' against the wind

Watch the young man run

I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
No, oh no not me
I did it my way

Out in the yard with your wife and children
Or workin' on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor,
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children, they lost their dear loved ones,
Pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out in pride for the red, white, and blue
And heroes who died just doin' what they do?

And look at yourself and what really matters?

Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages
And speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow,
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on """"I Love Lucy"""" reruns?

Stand in line to give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your fam'ly,

Move your body up and down (whoo!)
Make your booty touch the ground (whoo!)
I can't help but wonder why (whoo!)

When I whip with my hips you slip into a trance
I'm hoping you can handle all this jelly that I have
Now let's cut a rug while we scat some jazz

Is the baddest part of town
And if you go down there
You better just beware

You see he stand 'bout six foot four
All the downtown ladies call him ""Treetop Lover""
All the men just call him ""Sir""

The baddest man in the whole damned town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog

Now Leroy he a gambler
And he like his fancy clothes
And he like to wave his diamond rings
In front of everybody's nose
He got a custom Continental
He got an Eldorado too
He got a thirty two gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe

[Chorus]

Now Friday 'bout a week ago
Leroy shootin' dice
And at the edge of the bar
Sat a girl named Doris
And oo that girl looked nice
Well he cast his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
Cause Leroy Brown learned a lesson
'Bout messin' with the wife of a jealous man

And when they pulled them off the floor
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle
With a couple of pieces gone","Bad, Bad Leroy Brown [Instrumental]"

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be. Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be.

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.

Sybersound,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
And I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
It rode us all the way to New Orleans

I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I wass holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', don't mean nothin' hon' if it ain't free, no no
And, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
You know, feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGhee

From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun
There Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold

One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But, I'd trade all of my tomorrows, for a single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', that's all that Bobby left me, yeah
But, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
Hey, feelin' good was good enough for me, mm-hmm
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGhee

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Like you were walking on a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf, it was apricot
You had one eye on the mirror
And watched yourself gavotte

They'd be your partner, and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain, 
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you?
Don't you?

Oh, you had me several years ago
When I was still naive
Well, you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee, and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain, you're so vain
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you?

Well I hear you went to Saratoga
And your horse, naturally, won
Then you flew your Learjet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun
Well, you're where you should be all the time
And when you're not, you're with some underworld spy
Or the wife of a close friend, 
Wife of a close friend, and

I would say at this moment
When I'm faced with the knowledge
That you just don't love me
Did you think I would curse you
Or say things to hurt you
'Cause you just don't love me no more

Did you think I could hate you
Or raise my hands to you
Now come on you know me too well
How could I hurt you
When darling I love you
And you know I'd never, never hurt you

What do you think
I would give at this moment

I'd fall down on my knees
Kiss the ground that you walk on
If I could just hold you again

I want to tell her that I love but the point is probably moot
'Cause she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Why can't I find a woman like that?

Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Why can't I find a woman
Why can't I find a woman like that

And I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time
Wonderin' what she don't see in me
I've been funny; I've been cool with the lines
Ain't that the way love's supposed to be
Tell me why can't I find a woman like that

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Why can't I find a woman like that?

Heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands

We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searchin' our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

You're beggin' me to go then makin' me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad
It would help me to know
Do I stand in your way, or am I the best thing you've had
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love and I'm chained to your side

Love is a battlefield

We're losing control
Will you turn me away or touch me deep inside
And before this gets old, will it still feel the same
There's no way this will die
But if we get much closer, I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold

Face to face in secret places, feel the chill
Night fall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making
Still oversea, could it be the whole world opening wide
A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside
The weekend's why

Until we dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, to fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

Choice for you, is the view to a kill
Between the shades, assassination's standing still
The first crystal tears, fall as snowflakes on your body
First time in years, to drench you skin with lovers rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die

But can we dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, to fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, when all we see is the view to a kill",Rio [Instrumental]

I just can not hide it

Meeting Mr. Right, the man of my dreams
The one who shows me true love (or at least it seems)
With brown cocoa skin and curly black hair
It's just the way he looks at me that gentle loving stare

Finally you've come along
The way I feel about you,
It just can't be wrong
If you only knew the way I feel about you
I just can't describe it

My feelings can't describe it
Finally it has happened to me right in front of my face and

Where the brave are free and lovers soar

We won't hesitate break down the garden gate

I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory

I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies, yeah humor me and tell me lies

And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek so shall we find
And when you're feeling open I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Well, what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up?
When all it does is slow me down

Shake me and my confidence
About a great many things
But I've been there I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings

Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing ""Hey babe, let's keep in touch"", hey baby, let's keep in touch

But I want more than a touch I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line

Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up?

Tra la la la la bombardier, this is the pilot speaking
I've got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do

Oh sure the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink it and always be full, yeah I will drink it and always be full

Oh I like coffee and I like tea
I'd like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well all right okay, so be that way
I hope and pray that there's something left to say

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up

Should have fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring
A token of true love
Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

[Chorus]
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seeing double with the wrong one
You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

So now you're thinking 'bout
All you're missing how
Deep you're sinking, round and round and dragging down
Why don't you cash in your chips
Why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss, chalk it up to better luck
Could have been true love
But it wasn't
It should all add up
But it doesn't

There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seeing double with the wrong one
You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seeing double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There's your trouble, there is your trouble",There's Your Trouble
Sybersound,"He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said: ""That's a lie.""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer had gone

[Chorus]
But when you think ""Tim McGraw""
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think ""that little black dress""
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

[Chorus]

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read

Is when you think ""Tim McGraw""
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think ""that little black dress""
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh, think of me
Mmm

You said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie.""",Tim McGraw
Sybil,"Don't keep me dreaming
If all the hope is gone
If it's all over
Don't keep me hanging on

Don't give any hope to me
Spin any lines for me
Make the truth plain to see

Back and forth now I'm pacing
Young star in the making
Swear they sleeping on me
They pump me up to deflate me
I'm so close I can taste it
Oh you you don't even know
Don’t worry bout how I'm living
It’s none of your business
Who I'm with or where I stay
I
Told em but they wouldn't listen
Now they praying and wishing
To be me for the day
So I say

Shake em off
Shake em off

Syd,"I'm picking up pieces 
Little bit by little bit 
And I haven't done this in a while 
I'm seeing old places 
Take a hit of small town news 
Don't want to be here tonight 
I'm dealing with ghosts 
I guess we're gonna find out now 
Nobody here to catch my fall 
I'm playing house host 
To a different feeling every night 
I've never been so alone in a bed. 

And there's nothing new to see 
Just new eyes to cry with 
Losing her's like pulling teeth 
We both know 
This lovesick life has got to go 
But I don't want to be alone 

I'm staying out later 
Blurry eyes make brand new thoughts 
Shouldn't be driving tonight 
Faces fade faster 
If you don't see them every time 
You turn a corner in this place 
And her name takes forever every time I think it 
It leaves a little trail of thoughts behind 
Lover to friend seems easy when you say it 
I think we made it work last night 

And there's nothing new to see 
Just new eyes to cry with 
Losing her's like pulling teeth 
We both know 
This lovesick life has got to go 
But I don't want to be alone

Syd,"I thought of this song while I was sleeping in your arms 
Late last night night 
What I wanted to say was I love you forever
But it didn't come out right
All I could say was I'm cold give me covers
Could you turn out the light?
And we laughed at ourselves for our serious nature
And what could have been a fight 

You know I've been watching you all day long
The way we look at each other
The way you sing our songs
I can't wait till we get home
Because that's when I know
At the end of the day I'm the one who calls you baby

When you walk down the street they all stop and they stare
You know the way it is out there
He's either looking at you or he's looking at me
Get in the car, give me the keys
Let's drive down the middle of the city block
Roll down these windows and show them what I got
I found this sweet thing out there
But she's mine and not yours so what do you care?

I'm the one who calls you baby in the morning
I'm the who gets to tuck you in at night
I'm the one who says baby forever Baby together
Everything's just fine

You know I've been watching you all day long
The way we laugh at each other
The way you sing our songs
I can't wait till we get home
Because that's when I know

One more day
Another road another sign by my window
Counting miles away 

I'd come back I would
I would come right back to your arms
If I only could

So long hard roads
Wake me up when we're home
Wake me up when we're home

Yesterday is today is tomorrow the next day Is the same
As I wander these miles I wonder
Should I have stayed

I would turn around
I would come right back your way
Just not today

So long hard roads
I'm coming back home
So long hard roads
Wake me up when we're home

I might turn around
I'll come back some day
I might turn around
I'll be home some day

Syd Barrett,"Got a flip-top pack of cigarettes in her pocket
Feeling good at the top
Shopping in sharp shoes
Walking in the sunshine town 
Feeling very cool

Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

Cornering neatly she trips up sweetly
To meet the people
She's on time again
And then
I catch her by the eye
Then I stop and have to think
What a funny thing to do 'cause I'm feeling very pink

Overheard a lark today

Stretch your hand, glad feel,

There will be wine and drinking in the yard
There won't be anybody very hard
There will be lots of things that we can do
And all and more will be for you
Everything I knew I tried with you
But everything to you was never easy
So I went ahead around my world
I saw the things you do arriving by your side
To see you looking too
But I know this. I know, I never lied to you
It's been just like you're gone
For just one day for so long!
It's been so hard to bear with you not there

When I'm with you, to be with you,
To be alone can only think,

loosened the rope in the creek is entwined.
A feather from the wing of a wild young eagle,
pointed to the land where his fortune he'd find

From the shore hung a hot, heavy, creature infested
tropic, Swan Lee had a bow by his side

Grizzly bear and raccoon his fare.
He followed his ears to the great water fall,
Swan Lee knew deep down that his squaw was there!

confronted Swan Lee as his song he sang,
In the dawn, with his squaw, he was battling homewards

Syd Barrett,"Got the Bob Dylan blues
And the Bob Dylan shoes
And my clothes and my hair's in a mess
But you know I just couldn't care less
Gonna write me a song 'bout what's right and what's wrong
Got God and my girl and all that
Quiet while I make like a cat

Cause I'm a poet, doncha know it
And the wind you can blow it
Cause I'm Mr. Dylan the king
And I'm free as a bird on the wing

Roam from town to town, get to get people down
But I don't care too much about that
Cause my gut and my wallet are fat
Make a whole lot of dough but I deserve it though
I got soul and a good heart of gold
So I'll sing about war and the cold

Cause I'm a poet, doncha know it
And the wind you can blow it
Cause I'm Mr. Dylan the king
And I'm free as a bird on the wing

Well I sings about dreams and I rhymes it with seams
Cause it seems that my dream always means
That I can prophesy all kinds of things
Well the guy that digs me
Should try hard to see
That he buys all my discs in a hat.
And when I'm in town go see that.

Cause I'm a poet, doncha know it
And the wind you can blow it
Cause I'm Mr. Dylan the king
And I'm free as a bird on the wing",Bob Dylan Blues [#]
Syd Barrett,"Oh, where are you now
Pussy willow that smiled on this leaf?
When I was alone
You promised the stone from your heart

My head kissed the ground
I was half the way down, treading the sand
Please, please lift a hand

I'm only a person whose armbands beat
On his hands, hang tall
Won't you miss me?
Wouldn't you miss me at all?

The poppy birds way
Swing twigs coffee brands around
Brandish her wand with a feathery tongue

My head kissed the ground
I was half the way down, treading the sand
Please, please please lift the hand

I'm only a person with Eskimo chain
I tattooed my brain all the way
Don't you miss me?
Wouldn't you miss me at all?

Syd Barrett,"Got a flip-top pack of cigarettes in her pocket
Feeling good at the top
Shopping in sharp shoes
Walking in the sunshine town 
Feeling very cool

But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores
Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

Cornering neatly she trips up sweetly
To meet the people
She's on time again
And then
I catch her by the eye
Then I stop and have to think
What a funny thing to do 'cause I'm feeling very pink
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

I love, she
She loves me
See you

Feeding ducks by the afternoon tide

Syd Barrett,"I've got a bike. You can ride it if you like. 
It's got a basket, a bell that rings and 
Things to make it look good. 
I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it. 

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world. 
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.

I've got a cloak. It's a bit of a joke. 
There's a tear up the front. It's red and black. 
I've had it for months. 
If you think it could look good, then I guess it should. 

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world. 
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.

I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house. 
I don't know why. I call him Gerald. 
He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse. 

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world. 
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.

I've got a clan of gingerbread men. 
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men. 
Take a couple if you wish. They're on the dish. 

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world. 
I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.

I know a room full of musical tunes. 
Some rhyme, some ching. Most of them are clockwork. 
Let's go into the other room and make them work.",Bike
Syd Barrett,"A movement is accomplished in six stages 
And the seventh brings return. 
The seven is the number of the young light 
It forms when darkness is increased by one. 
Change returns success 
Going and coming without error. 
Action brings good fortune. 
Sunset. 

The time is with the month of winter solstice 
When the change is due to come. 
Thunder in the other course of heaven. 
Things cannot be destroyed once and for all. 
Change returns success 
Going and coming without error. 
Action brings good fortune. 
Sunset, sunrise.

Syd Barrett,"It's an idea someday
In my tears, my dreams
Don't you want to see her proof?
Life that comes of no harm
You and I, you and I and dominoes
The day goes by

You and I in place
Wasting time on dominoes
A day so dark, so warm
Life that comes of no harm
You and I and dominoes
Time goes by

Fireworks and heat someday
Hold a shell, a stick or play
Overheard a lark today, losing when my mind's astray
Don't you want to know with your pretty hair?
Stretch out your hand
Glad feel in an echo for your way

Syd Barrett,"This is a story about a girl that I knew
She didn't like my songs and that made me feel blue
She said, ""A big band is far better than you""

She don't rock 'n' roll, she don't like it
She don't do the stroll, well she don't do it right
Well every thing's wrong and my patience is gone
When I woke one morning and remembered this song
Kinda catchy

I hope that she will talk to me now and even allow me
To hold her hand and forget that old band

I strolled around to her pad
Her light was off and that's bad
Her sister said that my girl was gone
""But come inside boy, and play, play, play me a song""

I said, ""Yeah"" here I go
She's kinda cute don't you know
That after awhile of seeing her smile
I knew we could make it and make it in style?

So now I've got all I need
She and I are in love, we've agreed
She likes this song and my others too
So now you see my world is

'Cause of this tune what a boon this tune
I tell you soon we'll be lying in bed, happily wed
And I won't think of that girl and what she said",Here I Go [2010 Remix]
Syd Barrett,"There was a boy whose name was Jim
His friends, they were very good to him
They gave him tea, and cakes and jam
And slices of delicious ham
Oh Mother tell me more

Why'd'you have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air, waiting
You only have to read the lines of
Scribbly black and everything shines

The chief defect of Henry King
Was chewing little bits of string
At last he swallowed some which tied
Itself in ugly knots inside

Wondering and dreaming
The words have different meanings
Yes they did

And finding she was left alone
Went tiptoe to the telephone, 999
And summoned the immediate aid
Of London's Noble Fire Brigade

For all the time spent in that room
The doll's house darkness old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by
Oh Mother tell me more
Tell me more",Matilda Mother [2010 Mix]
Syd Barrett,"Trip to heave and ho
Up down to and fro'
You have no word
Trip trip to a dream dragon
Hide your wings in a ghost tower
Sails cackling at every plate we break

Was cracked by scattered needles
The little minute gong coughs and clears his throat

Madam you see
Before you stand
Hey ho never be still
The old original favorite grand
Grasshoppers green her Barian band
And the tune they play is in us confide

So trip to heave and ho
Up down to and fro'
You have no word

Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the Octopus ride

Isn't it good to be lost in the wood
Isn't it bad so quiet there in the wood
Meant even less to me than I thought
With a honey plough of yellow prickly seeds
Clover honey pots and mystic shining feed

Well the madcap laughed
At the man on the border
Hey ho huff the Talbot
Cheat he jumped shouting Kangaroo
It's true in their tree they cried

Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the Octopus ride

Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the Octopus ride

The madcap laughed
At the man on the border
Hey ho huff the Talbot

The winds ain't blew and the leaves in white
They'll never put me in their bag
The seas will reed you'll always see
So high you go so low you creep

The wind it blows in tropical heat
The drones they throng on mossy seats
The squeaking door will always squeak
Two up two down we'll never ever meet
So merely trip and go my side

Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the Octopus ride",Octopus [2010 Mix]

Syd Barrett,"There was a king who ruled the land
His majesty was in command
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle
Showers silver on the people
Oh mother, tell me more

Why'd'ya have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They're scribbly black and everything (shines)

Across the stream with wooden shoes
With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time

Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning
Yes they did

The doll's house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high on

Syd Lawrence,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine
Syd Lawrence,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue
Syd Lawrence,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye

Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina

Then you know that Tennessee is not very far

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

To all of you, American girls in the movies

With shiny smiles and plastic bodies

Sometimes growing up with you

Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri

I called you here today for a bit of bad news
I won't be able to see you any more
Because of my obligations
And the ties that you have
We've been meeting here every day
And since this is our last date together
I want to hold you just one more time
When you turn and walk away
Don't look back I want to remember you just like this
Let's just kiss
And say goodbye

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me till I'm through
This is something I hate to do
We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we done was wrong
Please, darling, don't you cry
Let's just kiss and say goodbye
Many months have passed us by
I'm gonna miss you I can't lie
I've got ties and so do you
I just think this is the thing to do
It's gonna hurt me I can't lie
Maybe you'll meet another guy
Understand me won't you try, try, try

(but they don't earn it)
But you're not gonna get from me

What you get ain't all what you see.

Relationships are up to you to manifest destiny
You fuss and fight all the time, seems like you can't agree
No compromise, everyone thinks they're so damn wise
But I know one thing's for certain
What you do brings everything, while what you say don't mean a damn thing
What you say don't mean a damn thing, oh, oh.

The way you hit on me

Every night I'd cry hopin' that they'd never see

The way you hit on me
How come you hit on me?

I made believe that it really didn't hurt me
Made believe that I only hurt myself
I believed you every time you said I'm sorry
Was too ashamed to tell someone I needed help.

I thought I was supposed to be your wife

To stay here and put up with this pain
You promised me the moon and the stars above but all I seem to get is rain

But I'm caught up in your whirlwind
I'm blown away

'Cause I'm not letting go so come and put your lips on mine
And I won't even hesitate, oh no baby not this time
I'm gonna give you all my loving. Gonna make up for lost time 

[Chorus] 
I just want to, I just want to break free
And let you put your hands all over me
I just want to lose control
Tonight I'm gonna let go
So baby come and put your arms around me
'Cause I think I'm ready to be all you need
And nobody has to know
Tonight I'm gonna let go

Won't you come a little closer while I slowly dim the lights
And put your hands up on my body. Baby you can take your time
Ain't no need to rush baby 'cause we got all night
I just want to scream your name and make you want to scream mine
I tried to fight the feelin' baby. Boy you got me hypnotized
But I can't help that I've been feenin' lately. I think about you all the time
Tonight I'm gonna get aggressive baby so don't you fear put up a fight
Tonight I'm gonna put it on you baby. Sit back, relax, enjoy the ride

Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote 
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY) 
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome 
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy (Oh) 

Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal 
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan 
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (Oh yeah) 

Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal

Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito

Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito 
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto 
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)

Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom 
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe 
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe 
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje 
Empecemos lento, después salvaje 

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito 
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza 
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza 

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito 
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas 
Pero pa montarlo aquí tengo la pieza

Syleena Johnson,"Hu, oh, oh, oh
Woo, ah

Listen, how do I live without you
When every day that I open my eyes
And turn to my side gotta smile deep inside
'Cause the one who was there was you

And how do I focus at work
Every time my cell phone rings
Or a pager beeps, I'm so nervous so anxious
But hoping the caller is you

And how am I supposed to get sleep
When every night that I lay down my head in my bed
You ain't there with your arms wrapped around me
Holding me all night through

And how could this be fair
When I gave you all of my love
All my time every dime after spending still
You could walk out the door to explore

Another relationship
Is that what this is about
Another relationship
That you would leave your own house
For another relationship

Was that the straw that broke the camels back
Another relationship, another relationship
Baby, tell me what's up with that

What does she have on me
What does she do that is so damn good
That would make you give up all the love
All the trust and the stuff that you built with me

Does she know my name
Did you ever tell her that she was taking
And breaking the bond that we strengthened
Through blood sweat and tears over the years
Boy you don't hear me

And has she met your son
Or maybe your mother and father
Your sister, 2 brothers and all of your cousins
Your uncle who loves me and still call me

And how could this be
Tell me what's better than storming the weather
And staying together with the one you love
And have a history

Another relationship
How could you go to her Is that what this is about
Another relationship
How could you leave your own house

Another relationship
Was that the straw that broke the camels back
Another relationship, another relationship
(Baby tell me what's up with that, tell me)

I thought that we were so happy
(I thought we were so happy, baby)
How could you leave so easily
Is she worth all that baby, oh

Another relationship
Oh, how could you baby
Another relationship
Sacrifice our happy life
For Another relationship

And this wasn't what you promised me
Another relationship, another relationship
You said you would love me
Love me, love me, love me forever baby

Another relationship
So how come I wasn't good enough, oh
Another relationship
I know all relationships get tough, oh

For another relationship
How could you do this to me
Another relationship, another relationship
Oh, we're suppose to be building a family

Another relationship
Oh, why, why, why did you leave
Another relationship
So, so, so, so easily

Another relationship
And what the hell will I do now
Another relationship, another relationship
When I'm carrying your child

Oh, yeah

It's funny how
Every time we talk
You're the boss
Not this time
Made up mind, love is lost
Draw the line, saw it coming
From a mile away
Bet you wish
You could just go change the day
You're the one to blame for all the childish games
Time I face the truth
You ain't tryna change
And I can't stay here (No more, no more)
Another minute, hour, second
Staring in your face

Is there an apartment for rent
Is time that I leave and pack all my ish
Does someone need a roommate
Comes a time when a woman has lost all faith
Is there an apartment for rent
Fed up female, no dog, no kids
Does someone need a roommate
Leave your number and a message
Cause I need it right away

You bring out my violent streak
I don' thrown it all you
But the kitchen sink
And I trust just as far as I can see
It's killing me to be up in your presence
So I look up to heaven, pray to God
Asking Him to give me strength
To stand up to this man
That's abusing me
Mentally it's too much
That I'm finding, all the lying
But I ain't gon' run behind him (Ain't goin' run behind him)
That I ain't my life
Cause I can walk away

I ain't no money
But palimony pays
18% for the trouble that you made
You made your own bed hard now lie
You keep the crib

Cause I'm moving out today

Oh, Yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause I'm out Mr. Landlord
I dun lost, I dun lost all faith

Fed up now, just can't take no more from you, no
I'm know all I'm all I can do
Boy, I'm through, so fed with you

MTV puttin' killers on the screen
Children dance to a song where murder is the theme
Responsibility! Who's to blame?
Never blame the labels or the artists
Heavens, no, no no

It started in California, so you wanna be a thug?

Oooo, oooo, ooh

Verse 1:
What makes you think that I'm gonna wait forever
When we both know that your never gonna leave her
What makes you think that I don't wanna man
I could call my own
What makes you think that I don't want a family
What makes you think that I wanna be unhappy
Boy, I can't do this, it ain't right
I don't think that you should call me anymore

I can't sleep at night
I toss and turn 
My mind is bursting
My conscious burns
I can't stop thinking about this love
And if the shoe was on the other foot

Chorus:
(Leave me alone), if your not gonna be here for me
(Leave me alone), if your not gonna do shyt for me
If you got a girl at home and she's pregnant
Wondering when your comin home
(Leave me alone), don't wanna know you got problems in your marriage
(Leave me alone), if you think I'm gonna help carry your baggage
(Leave me alone), cause I don't wanna share your love
Baby, I can bad on my own

(Listen)
Verse 2:
What makes you think that you could get away with murder
What makes it so easy for you to hurt her
What makes you think that I don't know that you can the same thing to me
I know you think I'll do anything for ya
Cause I been so greedy and selfish just like you
But now I'm finished, it ain't right
Even though it felt so right, it's still so wrong, oh

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Mon-day, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday
If Sunday's only the day we spent a week
What's the purpose of us
It just ain't worth it to me

(Chorus)

Made me bloom just like a flower
Since the first time we took a shower
Made love for hours (oh)
And I could feel the power of your love

And in my heart 
You'll always have a place

Cause I am your woman

More than anything
More than a diamond ring with a stone in pink 
You're been more to me lately
You mean more than those things
More than the air I breathe (more) 
More than the food I eat (more)
More than the shoes on my feet (more)
Oh, you are more than to me

The moment that I saw you 
Knew I was crazy for you 
The look in your eyes
(Said those things, many things to me)
Girl, join this walk with me
Believe me when I say, 
I'm with you for life,
Right by your side, make you my wife

You're my autumn when the seasons change
Falling in love, can't wait to change to rain
Boy, you're like the sun rays
Shining down on a special day
Like sand to a beach
The sweet to a peach
You make my heart beat
Change me from Miss to Mrs. 
Granted all my wishes, you're more

More than a friend becomes a lover
Here to the end don't want no other
Through thick and thin
We've got each other
More than anything
I ask for 
Or pray for
You are my joy, oh",More

And he kissed me softly on my cheek
Said to me, ""You smell good enough to eat""
Girl I swear my heart must've skipped a beat
He's got me feeling like I did when I was seventeen

(But I couldn't wait) For him to put his hands all over me
(So I'm getting warm and I'm waiting) For him to make love to me, (slowly)

[Chorus:]
Then slowly, he undressed me
Then slowly, he laid me down
Pulled my panties down
Then slowly, he went down on me
Then slowly, we made love

Ohh, been an hour
Since his love had been in me
Couldn't believe he felt this good inside of me
It was everything I dreamed that it would be
And like a virgin, I was tight
But he loosened me
Then slowly, he began to speak
""You're so good, baby""
That's what he said to me
Girl, I'm telling you that this one is the truth
Put it on me like a real man is s'pose to

(And I couldn't wait)To feel him come inside of me.......
(Cause he wasn't selfish, he was patient)
Ohhh, oohh
Girl, he made love to me
But slowly

[Chorus]

Oooh (We made love)
To the steady rhythm of my heart beats
(We made love)
To the tears came down my face
(We made love)
Til it rained sunshine and the fall leaves turned to snow
(We made love)
He took my body through the four seasons
(We made love)
Til our spirits locked and wouldn't let go
(We made love)
Til our bodies couldn't come no more
(We made love)
Til the full moon became the sunlight's glow
He filled my cup
Til it over flowed, ooooooohhh ooooh oooh

Verse 1:
It's winter
I last saw you in May
That was the month we
Went our separate ways
And every moment since that day
There have been things that I been wanting to say
(Like I) Didn't mean to say those things
(And I) Didn't mean to cause you pain
(Just wanted to make you happy)
And I still wanna do that

And if you really
Wanna know 
My arms... are still open 
No matter where we are
And no matter where we go
My arms (For you) 
Are still open
Verse 2:
I'm dreaming
Of a perfect day
We are together
Can you see us together
And I'm hoping
You might feel the same way
Hope we can start new
Cause I used to love you
(Chorus)
And I miss you 
I need you 
I'm so hopeless
Here without you
Wanna see you 
Wanna touch you 
Wanna show you 
How much I love you
I understand you
I will swear to you
Here's a girl who
Is there for you
All this love I have inside...

Sometimes I wonder how I make it

How do I keep a smiling face?
See all I wanna do is sing
Without compromising me
So hard to stay true to me in a lying industry

And I just wanna be able to wear my own hair and nails
(And not be judged for)
How much money I make how many records I sale
(Cause that don?t define me)
How can I teach my son to be a leader if I?m always following?
(That?s right)
Too much stress to be someone else
It?s hard enough just being me

I just wanna be me (All the time seven days a week)
I just wanna be me (Summer, Fall, and Winter, Spring)
I just wanna be me (Best qualified for the job)
No one can be any better than me
I just wanna be me (In the shower when I fall overseas)
I just wanna be me (With my friends and my family)
I just wanna be me (Best qualified for the job)
No one can be any better than me

Threw all my cards upon the table
Started my own record label
(Decided it was time for me)
To do this by myself
I?m tryna do real big things
Tryna be all I can be
(But I gotta still do me)
No matter what ? step

And I just wanna be able to wear my own hair and nails
(And not be judged for)
How much money I make how many records I sale

Or what color you happened to be
As long as you're live and breathing
This is got to be one of journey

Hey, as a young girl I had my heart set on many big dreams
Then I grew up and found the world ain't nothing what it seems
Hey, then the tears came down the face of my reality, yeah
When I realized how mean and rude this world can be

And if I ruled the world
(I would give love to all the woman and children)
I would break free every mind
(And I would supply all the dollars to feed them)

There would be peace and love on Earth
(There'd be no war, peace study no more)
Soldiers be free to make the choice
(To live or die so I'd free them the voice)

All I want is freedom
(From all the stress, the test, the mess, the lies of your enemies)
All I want is freedom
(Freedom to fight for everything that you believe)

Freedom
(Freedom to say what you think, free from the prejudice that changes all)
All I want is freedom
(You have to have it, where would you be without your freedom)

And no matter, if you're from the hood or from the hills of Beverly
Soil of America, from the far place overseas
Black, yellow or white, straight, gay or somewhere in between
We all want a one nation under God that's free

And if I ruled the world
(I would give love to all the woman and children)
I would break free every mind
(And I would supply all the dollars to feed them)

There would be peace and love on Earth
(There'd be no war, peace study no more)

And after all that I've done for you
After all of the chances I gave to you
You still let me down
All that drama that you took me through
I'll be damned if I stay with you

And even though you said you change for me
Still turned right around and cheated on me
And you let me down
Say goodbye boy I'm about to leave
You let me down for the last time


How many times have you told me you love me
And how many times have you ran out on me
Then said I'm sorry
What kinda woman do you take me for
Do you think I'm crazy
Did you think that I was gonna keep on letting you play me
But oh hell no can't take no more
Coz I only human
I've given all the love I'm gonna give
It's time to save my love for somebody else

And it's so hard to walk away from you
But I'm better off all by myself
I wish things could be different
I wish we cud of been happy
All the tears and years I spent
Its like I did it for nothing
But oh hell no
I can't take no more
Coz I'm only human
I've given all the love I'm gonna give
It's time I save my love for someone else

You let me down
I was all a mess
Now I'm taking back my happiness
You still let me down
All the drama you took me through
I'll be damned if I stay with you

Can't take no more I'm so tired of you
And you let me down
Say goodbye boy coz I'm about to leave

Preaching upon open ears of the deaf

Sewing our mouths shut as nothing escapes
Love and grave is a display of a man you once were

But unlike the hand of Midas
What you touch with turn to shit

Dans son harmonica il souffle jusqu'à mordre
Et les doigts d'son violon écartèlent ses cordes

Qu'il en met d'autant plus que c'est son dernier soir
Depuis qu'il a compris le commerce exotique
Où l'on vend en bibelots son peuple et sa musique

Au cœur de ce qui fut un chêne
Sur la vitre je trace un cœur
Que la buée retient à peine

Des airs à faire pendre un merle

Dans la sloche un collier de perles

Crime passionnel rue Lacordaire
Paraît qu'ça va d'plus en plus mal
Pour les mangeurs de pommes de terre
Paraît aussi qu'le Président
S'amuse à jouer à la roulette
Entre deux annonces, à la page cent
Avec c'qui reste de la planète

Sylvain Lelièvre,"Les moulins à vent sont à vendre
Tous les enfants sont devenus grands
Les derniers fous n'ont qu'à se rendre
L'hiver s'est trompé de printemps
Et l'on souscrit des assurances
On fait l'épargne de son cœur
On compte-goutte ses imprudences
On a tellement peur d'avoir peur

Venir au monde
Une autre fois revoir le jour
Mais cette fois
Naître de ses propres amours
Se mettre au monde
Couper tous les cordons d'avant
Pour simplement
Redevenir son propre enfant

S'il est possible de renaître
Je recollerai tous les éclats perdus
Des anciennes fenêtres
Et je ne vivrai plus
Que pour devenir mon propre veuf
Pour enfin tout recommencer
Avec le corps et le cœur neufs
Sans avenir, mais sans passé
 
Venir au monde
Ouvrir les yeux, tendre les bras
Que chaque fois
Soit la première tant qu'il faudra
Se mettre au monde
A chaque jour, à chaque instant
Pour simplement

Sylvain Lelièvre,"Autrefois Yahvé vint prendre thé
Chez son vieux pote Abraham
Il lui dit «Mon vieux, t’as l’air de douter
Je dois éprouver ton âme
Si tu crois en moi, si j’ai ton soutien
En un mot si t’as la foi
Ton petit vaurien de fils qui fout rien
Tu l’immoleras pour moi»

REFRAIN 	
Toi t’aurais jamais fait ça, papa
Non t’aurais jamais, jamais fait ça 

 
Faut dire qu’Abraham approchait alors
Plus ou moins cent quarante ans 
Qu’il fût quelque peu fêlé sur les bords
C’est bien possible et pourtant
Il partit dès l’aube du lendemain
Emmenant son fils avec lui
Et sans dire un mot il prit le chemin
Dont Yahvé l’avait instruit

Toi t’aurais jamais fait ça, papa
Non t’aurais jamais, jamais fait ça 

Pourquoi tant de bois?» demande Isaac
(Tel était le nom du fils)
Son père lui répond sans le moindre trac
«On va faire un sacrifice»
«Épatant! dit l’autre, mais où est l’agneau?
«Sans mouton, pas de méchoui»
Mais soudain le vieux brandit son couteau
Soudain le fils a compris

Toi t’aurais jamais fait ça, papa
Non t’aurais jamais, jamais fait ça 

On connaît la suite: l’Ange est arrivé
Stoppant le bras du prophète
Faut croire que la chose amusa Yahvé
Puisqu’un jour il l’a refaite
Des siècles plus tard, sous un autre nom
Il envoie son propre fils
Crever sur la croix, mais pas d’ange, non
Pour le soustraire au supplice

Toi t’aurais jamais fait ça, papa
Non t’aurais jamais, jamais fait ça
Toi t’aurais jamais fait ça, papa
Non t’aurais jamais, jamais fait ça, papa!

Sylvain Lelièvre,"Il était embaumeur mais jouait du trombone
Et les jours où personne ne daignait trépasser
Seul entre ses cercueils et son vieux gramophone
Il prenait des chorus avec Tommy Dorsey

Ya pas de sot métier comme le dit le proverbe
Et s'il faut que la mort soit votre gagne-pain
Tout plutôt que l'armée, vive les pompes funèbres
C'est moins dur que docteur et plus sûr qu'assassin

Donc il était croque-mort et battait la mesure
Tout en déboutonnant trois ou quatre bémols
Sa fiancée cachée, son unique aventure
C'était son instrument parfumé de formol

Pour le reste il était toujours de circonstance
Chagrin pour escroquer les veuves tout en pleurs
Distrait pour encaisser les chèques d'assurance
Artiste pour monter les Cadillac en fleurs

Lorsque la mort le remercia de ses services
On trouva son trombone serré contre son corps
On l'appelle depuis le croque-mort à coulisse
Et sur sa pierre on lit, gravé en lettres d'or:

Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break!

Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?

Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?

I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye

Sylvia,"Sittin' in a restaurant she walked by
I seem to recall that certain look in your eye
I said ""who's that?"" You said with a smile
""Oh it's nobody, oh nobody""

Maybe that explains the last two week
You called me up, dead on your feet
Working late again, I ask who with
You said ""nobody, oh nobody.""

Well your nobody called today
She hung up when I asked her name
Well I wonder does she think she's being clever?
(Clever)
You say nobody's after you
The fact is what you say is true
But I can love you like nobody can, even better

Late last night we went for a drive
You were miles away I asked ""who's on your mind?""
You said, ""Nobody, nobody. Why do you ask?""
Oh, her again I could have told you that.

We came back home got ready for bed
I said to myself I've got one shot left
Your still mine and I won't stand in line
Behind nobody, nobody!

Well your nobody called today
She hung up when I asked her name
Well I wonder does she think she's being clever?

Sylvia,"Flew in this morning on the 8-0-5
Had a couple of hours to spare.
I wanted to see the hometown again
It'd been years since I was there.
A taxi took me by the old grade school
But on the playground there was no sound
Windows boarded up, a rusty sign laying on the ground.

[Chorus]
They say you can't go back
Anymore than you can stop the wind from blowing,
You can't change the changes going on (going on)
They say you can't go back anymore than you can stop the door from closing.
Once you're gone, you can't go back home

Drove in front of the movie house where I spent my Saturdays
Quarter got ya in back then, costed three and a half today.
And he stopped by Shipleys bakery,
But Mr. Shipley had passed away.
I got back in the cab, I saw that everything had changed.

[Chorus]

Taxi pulled up in front of your house,
I started to get out,
Then I, I saw a little boy open the door
I quickly turned around.
I told the driver, guess there's no one home,
I think he understood, you've got a plane to catch he said, the drive will do you good.

They say you can't go back anymore than you can stop the wind from blowing,
You can't change the changes going on, going on,
They say you can't go back anymore than you can stop the door from closing,
Once you're gone, you can't go back home
Once you're gone, you can't go back home

Sylvia,"You feel so close, how could you be gone?
My dream is right, reality is wrong
'Cause I'm still with you where my heart's concerned
From where we were there is no return

'Cause I never quite got back from loving you
I'm still out there in that world you took me to
I just got lost when you found someone new
And I never quite got back from loving you

A year of nights hasn't changed that much
The love we had, time can never touch
When I close my eyes you're never out of sight
I'm in this house but I'm not home tonight

'Cause I never quite got back from loving you
I'm still out there in that world you took me to
I just got lost when you found someone new
And I never quite got back from loving you

Sylvia,"I found a ciggarette, circled with lipstick
and the lingering of perfume, in the room

except for the snapshot, 
he doesn't know I've got (Ive got, uh huh)
he almost pulled off the perfect lovers crime
except for the snapshot
that puts me on (on top, uh huh)
he thinks he's got one on me, 
but he hasn't seen the Snapshot

He says he bought the new car
strictly for business
and the new clothes match the new smile on his face
the extra key on his chain
must be to the office
poor baby's leaving early, staying late
he's got an alibie for every move he makes

I go in early, come home late
Trying to get over you
But I keep thinking more of you

My friends say that I'll forget
[Incomprehensible] that’s a losing bet
If I could just turn love to hate
Maybe then I could escape

Anytime, anyplace
In someone else's eyes I still see your face
Anyplace, anytime
Anywhere I am you're on my mind

You'll always be a memory
That time can never re-arrange
Anytime, anytime, anyplace

Every night when I get home
It's just another TV dinner alone
With thoughts of you inside my head
I fall into my lonely bed

Then I turn the radio on
Ah but every DJ plays our song
And I'll just lie there restlessly
Wishing you were next to me

Anytime, anyplace
In someone else's eyes I still see your face

Sylvia McNair,"Remind me not to find you so attractive
Remind me that the world is full of men
When I start to miss you, to touch your hand, to kiss you
Remind me to count to ten

I had a feeling when I met you
You'd drive me crazy if I let you
But all my efforts to forget you
Remind me I'm in love again

Not to mention that I love you

To be sorry that we met
Although I adore you, remind me to ignore you
You're one thing I will regret
So when your charm begins to blind me
I'll simply tie my hands behind me
Don't let me kiss you, please remind me
Unless, my darling, you forget",Remind Me
Sylvia McNair,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You

With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up

Sylvia McNair,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

Sylvia McNair,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're broccoli.
You're a prize, You're a night at Coney,

Rappin Queen's my claim to fame
Gonna tell you a story you didn't know
Get ready get set, cause here I go
I knew the land, of Rappersville
Castle on a mount called Sugar Hill
Like Diana Ross said loud and clear:
""This is my house, I live here!""
We have a King, I must confess 
We share everything cause we love the best
We have money and friends of every kind
Friends are his, money's mine
My every wish, is his command
Furs everyday at the wave of my hand
I consider myself a fortunate lady
Sporting my Rolls, and grey Mercedes
Ahhhh, ha ha ha!

Ohh yes it's good to be the Queen, ohh la la
Gee but it's good to be the Queen
(Sing it girls, what it is, is what is is, sing it girls, sing it girls, well)
You can be sure about one thing, ohh la la
Ma oui, oh yes! Ma oui, oh yes! Ma oui it's good to be the Queen

The Queen of Sugar Hill, ah
We partied all day in the castle all night
All the VIP's of the world was in sight
Drinks were free so was the fun
There was more than enough for everyone
So Sammy and Frankie, mingle in the crowd
Heard Stevie and Michael, singin' out loud
They were hippin' and hoppin' all over the place
Bangin' the boogie right in my face
I got on the mic and I started to rap
Feet start slappin', hands began to clap
They were cuttin up records, faster and faster
But no one did it like our Grandmaster
The fun I had, I could not measure
This rappin', is a sho nuff treasure
The people all stood and began to scream
As somebody yelled, ""Long live the Queen""

[Chorus]
It's good to be the Queen!

Badi mbatu BADI MBATU badi mbatu badi mbatu

It started back, in seventy-nine
My whole darn future, was on the line
I created, a brand, new sensation
Through my mind and the whole darn nation
With the Big Bank Hank, the Wonder Mike
And this kid called Master G (that's me)
Well would you believe their Rapper's Delight
Went down in history, hahaha!

I'll never forget, the King of Kings
Break it on down

Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

Sylvia Syms,"Magic mirror come and search my heart
Can you tell me what you see
There's a thousand voices whispering
Songs and you're the melody

So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive
Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive 
love ecstasy imagining you, imagining me
The beauty we both can see

You're the dream I prayed would come along
To make my fantasy
Day and night you live inside my heart
You're the flame of love to me

Sylvia Syms,"On the first of may, it is moving day,
Spring is here, so blow your job,
Throw your job away!

Now's the time to trust,
To your wanderlust,
In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
Just you wait.......!

In a mountain greenery,
Where god paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together.

While you love your lover,
Let blue skies, be your cover-let,
When it rains we'll laugh at the weather.

And if you're good,
I'll search for wood,
So you can cook... while i stand look-in'

Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery

Won't bite you dear,
I'll let them sting, me on the finger!

Sylvia Syms,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away

Out of town were the people I knew

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking

Please forgive and then forget
Or maybe darling better yet, oh-oh

Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music

She says I began to sing long before I could talk
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

Welcome to the great incredible paper chase
Keep your boots laced if you want to keep pace

Oh no, niggas ain't scared to hustle
It's been seven days, the same clothes
Ask them originals 'cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg and Pharaoh
Step away from the mic, they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

Say my name, say my name
Observe how I stake my claim, I independently lay it down
And played my game, my own two raise my flame
'Cause dick ridin' ain't my thang

I earned what they said I wouldn't
I got it the way they said I couldn't
But now I'm gettin' it and they whole grill is crooked
Mad 'cause I'm gettin' caked out from my bookings

When y'all was askin' permission, I just stepped up and took it
What? The kid's better buy my rookie card now
'Cause after this year, the price ain't comin' down
And if you got a joint bubblin' then get money now

'Cause in a minute, there's gonna be some real trouble comin' out
Just a warnin', as usual some cats won't heed it
The hard headed always gotta feel it to believe it
It's a shame that jealous gaze is too short to see it

But when they face hit the cement, they nod in agreement
We could play nice and decent or dirty like the 7-1 Precinct
Call it a day or make it a long evenin'
You keep on schemin', man, give me some more reason
To have the women in your mama's church screamin', ""Lord Jesus""

Harder than y'all 'cause, I'm smarter than y'all
I know that deep down, it's got to be bothering y'all
Pay attention, watch fly gon' get larger than y'all
Put your pride on the rocks, make you swallow it all

The mathematic problem for y'all, it just get harder to solve
Every day that the saga evolve
The do or die, stay rumblin' and bumblin' hard
And when we move, we ain't got no discussion at all

East coast on your neck and you ain't shruggin' it off
Try to bullyfoot and end up stumblin' off
I'm Daddy Brooklyn, y'all niggaz are the sons of New York
Gettin' spanked when there's too much trouble to talk
Respect mine

Oh no, look at who they let in the back door
From Long Beach to Brooklyn they know
We rock from the East to West coast
Queens salute to Pharaoh
(You know)
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

Very contagious, raps should be trapped in cages
Through stages of wackness, Pharaoh's raps are blazin'
And it amazes me how you claim thug
But go two-ways without Sky Tel pagers

I'm intellectual, pass more essays
Than motorcade police parades through East LA
More beef then deli's, thus, what I vent is just
What you lust to vent is irrele'

Huh, Hallelujah, Pharaoh Monch'll do ya
Maintain the same frame of mind, screw ya
Get the picture, sit ya, seat ya, preacher with scriptures
I'm equipped to rip ya, reach ya

Pharoahe and Mos is verbal osmosis
Coast to coast, we boast to be the most explosive here
Ferocious, the lyrical prognosis
The dosage is leavin' you mentally unfocused here

MC's, just come on 'round
You're the next contestants on 'Catch-A-Beat-Down'
Don't be hesitant, sound cracks the sediment
It's evident we medicine for your whole town

Sky's the limit, game's infinite when I'm in it
All windows is tinted, how you seein' me when I'm in it?
Rap, we got it on lock, man, stop that
Put that mic back down, boy, drop that
Pharaoh's flows, blows shows like Afros
We hate y'all though, that's why Nate Dogg goes

Oh no, niggas ain't scared to hustle

No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

With no vivid reason here to find

With you say no special place to go

You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed
