Petula Clark,"Sweetest little fellow, everybody knows;
Don't know what to call him but he's mighty like a rose!
Lookin' at his mammy with eyes so shiny blue,
Makes you think that heaven is comin' close to you.
When he's there a-sleepin' in his little place,
Think I see the angels looking thro' the lace.
When the dark is falling, when the shadows creep,
Then they come on tip-toe to kiss him in his sleep.
Sweetest little fellow, everybody knows,
Don't know what to call him but he's mighty like a rose!
Lookin' at his mammy with eyes so shiny blue,
Makes you think that heaven is comin' close to you.",Mighty Like a Rose
Petula Clark,"Evening shadows make me blue
When each weary day is through
How I long to be with you
My happiness

Every day I reminisce 
Dreaming of your tender kiss
Always thinking how I miss
My happiness

A million years it seems
Have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again
There'll be no blue memories then

Whether skies are grey or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you
My happiness

A million years it seems
Have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again
There'll be no blue memories then

Whether skies are grey or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you
My happiness",My Happiness
Petula Clark,"Sometimes I get the feeling
I was back in the old days long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect, you know

Days were endless, we were crazy, we were young
Sun was always shinin', we just lived for fun
Sometimes I feel like lately I just don't know
Rest of my life seems just a show

Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find, I still love you

You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame? Ain't that a shame?
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game

No use in sitting thinkin' on what you did
Find more lyrics at ※ Mojim.com
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately, I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

'Cause these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
Those days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look, I find no change

Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find, I still love you

I still love you, I love you
I still love you, love you
I still love you, I still love you
Still love you, ooh yeah",These Are the Days of Our Lives [#]
Petula Clark,"You're just too good to be true. 
Can't take my eyes off you.
You'd be like heaven to touch. 
I want to hold you so much.
At long last love has arrived. 
And I thank God I'm alive.
You're just too good to be true. 
Can't take my eyes off you. 

Pardon the way that I stare. 
There's nothing else to compare.
The sight of you leaves me weak. 
There are no words left to speak.
But if you feel like I feel. 
Please let me know that it's real.
You're just too good to be true. 
Can't take my eyes off you. 

I love you baby, and if it's quite all right,
I need you baby to warm the lonely night. 
I love you baby.
Trust in me when I say: 
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray. 
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you. Stay. 

And let me love you, baby. Let me love you 

I love you baby, and if it's quite alright,
I need you baby to warm the lonely night. 
I love you baby. 
Trust in me when I say: 
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray. 
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you. Stay.

Oh pretty baby. Trust in me when I say: Oh pretty baby",Can't Take My Eyes Off You

You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Where the lovelight gleams
I'll be home for Christmas

Petula Clark,"Silent night! Holy night!
All's asleep, one sole light,
Just the faithful and holy pair,
Lovely boy-child with curly hair,
Sleep in heavenly peace!

Silent night! Holy night!
God's Son laughs, o how bright.
Love from your holy lips shines clear,
As the dawn of salvation draws near,
Jesus, Lord, with your birth!

Silent night! Holy night!
Brought the world peace tonight,
From the heavens' golden height
Shows the grace of His holy might
Jesus, as man on this earth!

Silent night! holy night!
Where today all the might
Of His fatherly love us graced
And then Jesus, as brother embraced.
All the peoples on earth!

Silent night! Holy night!
Long we hoped that He might,
As our Lord, free us of wrath,
Since times of our fathers He hath
Promised to spare all mankind!

Silent night! Holy night!

Peyote Asesino,"como una enfermedad
una hecatombe termonuclear
te puedo hacer sentir bien
animal anormal, un problema terminal
te puedo ver dormir hacer sufrir
hasta más no pedir
puedo tocarte o asesinarte
solamente por amor al arte
puedo ser tu peor pesadilla
tu nieve de fresa,
un montón de pastillas tranquilizantes
puedo darte para adelante
dejarte en calma si
te duele la barriga
cuando el veneno que puse en tu vaso
te deje boca arriba
why me pidas por favor
que tu día termine mejor
tratame como un criminal
ya vas a ver te va a gustar
ser solo otro cuerpo muerto
que aparece amarrado
flotando en el puerto
uno dos tres cuatro cinco
no te me pongas al brinco
que te parto el hocico why te lo mastico
voy a pedirte que creas en mí
como si yo fuera el dalai lama
que no me hagas big drama
es mejor echar fama de ser ojete why culero
mucho mejor que acabar con el pecho
lleno de agujeros

echo el resto
bailo un breakdance
igual te doy un pesto
es un momento
que tiene algo violento
escucho tu lamento why sé
que mi movimiento es lento
no puedo esquivar la trompada
me cae como una roca
why entiendo que nadie regala nada
mientras me parten la boca
yo ya no dudo como un tipo rudo
se que voy a ver aunque todo esta oscuro
no hay nada de malo en saber
que los de afuera esta vez no son de palo
haces un trato barato por un rato why no hay
quien te avise que es lo que dice
la letra chica del contrato
no la armes de pedo
no la hagas de tos
te lo dije una vez
te lo digo dos
te creíste fuerte de mas te dieron por atrás
por algo mas que un papel
why como el cardenal gasdas
ya no sabés a donde vas
aunque hagas buena letra con ese jetra
hay una bala perdida que te arranca la vida
la cara te suda la herida te supura
why sabes que ya ni cristo
va a venir en tu ayuda
esa minita esta frita por mas que repita
que su alma no se contenta
con algo de guita en una cuenta
le dijeron no te metas why un par de tetas
no alcanza para volcar la balanza
se arriesga why se pierde

sin tener vuelto

PEZ,"Into this life we're thrown
Just as if outta nowhere, and from that instant
Begin to be program', to decode eve—
Rything we see in a particular way
Now some have the nerve to venture off into the unknown
Some don't, they're content to watch from the front row
Either way it's still a game that can be cut-throat
You don't wanna be on the wrong end of all the gun smoke
But your destiny waits
So there's really no need for precaution, of course
We are cautious, it's all we know
Just one false move and it's all she wrote, that's what they tell us
So we all take aim to stake claim
And if you get there just pray you maintain
Long enough, not to suffer and
No longer have to sing a song for your supper
Let's pray

How long we gonna keep on sufferin'
And fallin' on our knees for nothin'?
I'm starting to believe in somethin'
It's kinda hard to hear it but it's callin' out

Because I look inside, find this insight
Guessin' in this life, people would think I
Must know really what mine's for
But the truth I'm not quite sure
All I'm doin' is tryna follow my heart
Even though that my head's sayin', 'what if I can't?'
What if my path is already planned out
I already see how the story will pan out
It's not gonna be, well shit still I'm not gonna stop
When a job is the only other option I got
I'm not sayin' that it's wrong 'cause it's not
But if you're workin' and it doesn't make you happy then what
Is the point? I mean really?
Either you can take a shot or try to merely make do
When you see that that's the only other move
Then there really isn't anything to lose, choose

How long we gonna keep on sufferin'
And fallin' on our knees for nothin'?
I'm starting to believe in somethin'
It's kinda hard to hear it but it's callin' out

Hey that's the way everything goes
Some get what they want, the rest never get close
That's why they say if you ever get chosen
You made it 'cause anything goes
That's why we find ourself in a time where
People deny what's really inside them, frightened
Mighta feared that the outcome is doubtful
Not knowin' in itself that's the downfall, it's weird right
See we think we'll never make an impact
Since a young age we've been trained to think that
That's the only reason we're beaten
They know they can feed us this shit and we'll believe it, either
You can struggle through life or take your story
And then turn it into something you like it's all up in your mind
And in mine man, I'm leavin' on a plane
So if you're comin' there too well then I'll see you on the way
Let's go

How long we gonna keep on sufferin'
And fallin' on our knees for nothin'?
I'm starting to believe in somethin'
It's kinda hard to hear it but it's callin' out

How long we gonna keep on sufferin'
And fallin' on our knees for nothin'?
I'm starting to believe in somethin'
It's kinda hard to hear it but it's callin' out

Tie on your best smile, check your disguise.

You can leave your troubles at the door
We have ways to make you cheer

We can fit you with a suit of clothes
That will make you look like us,

A ladder or a truss

Or live like Howard Hughes;
Come on what have you got to lose...

You can even swap your wife

Rockets launched if he is late again
Pushed and squeezed on the sardine machine
To his Mr. Nine till Five routine.
Filing piling on his desk all day
In and out from tray to endless tray;

Luncheon daydreams over curried eggs.
Yes sir, no sir, on the squawking phone,
Five o'clock rush-hour exhausted home.
T.V., bedtime and excite the wife
Set the clock get up repeat through life.

Post the pools and watch the 'Box' till ten
Shuts his eyes, wakes up it's Monday again ...

PFM,"Cerco il sole ma non see'è...
Dorme ancora la campagna, forse no,
È sveglia, mi guarda, non so.
Già l'odore della terra odor di grano,
Sale adagio verso me.
E la vita nel mio petto batte piano,
Respira la nebbia, penso a te.
Quanto verde tutto intorno a ancor piú in là,
Sembra quasi un mare l'erba,
E leggero il mio pensiero vola e va
Ho quasi paura che si perda...
Un cavallo tende il collo verso il prato
Resta fermo come me:
Faccio un passo, lui mi vede, è già
Fuggito...
Respiro la nebbia, penso a te.
No, cosa sono adesso non lo so
Sono come, un uomo in cerca di se stesso
No, cosa sono adesso non lo so
Sono solo, solo il suono del mio passo...
Ma intanto il sole tra la nebbia filtra già:
Il giorno come sempre sarà.

Gathered deep

Across the plain
Sweep your course

Feed cranes along your banks.

Cloy where once men drank.

Dips his paintbrush in the silence
Of the lake which mirrors the sky.
Milkmaids waltz around the haystack
When the maestro blows his trumpet.
Bandsmen hammer at the cafe
For the gypsy's drawbridge bottle.

By a handful of disguises
So I tried them all on
And they were all the right sizes

I know that I will never leave the same way
I got here by myself but

And healing that the soul might live again

Never would've bought it
Never would've thought it could be
Never would've held it

To save this dying man

I see a story told in whole

As if it didn't matter
I walked the edge so fearlessly
Blindfolded by my lustful eyes
Deafened by a string of lies

And Your eyes held me in Your stare
You gazed into my empty soul
Spoke the words that burned a hole

Don't you know that I'm the lover of souls
And I came to be near
From this very earth I made you

Some of us like sheep have gone astray
Some of us like fools live for today
And then it's gone and we're left with nothing
We fight to hold it all inside our hands
Somehow we think we'll understand
What no eye has ever seen and no mind comprehended

But by the grace of God I am made whole again
In the times I have fallen and when I felt the shame
Yet by the grace of God I am made whole again

So I bought the lie and I chained my soul

Something to slow down the hands of time
It's all slipping away moving so fast
It's out of my reach and out of my grasp
I'm searching for truth I know it must be
Somewhere just around the corner from me
I've been feeling a need from something inside
A need for a change a change in my life

And it's You, Jesus (only You and You alone)
You found me so deep in the dark
And You called out my name
Yes You, Jesus (only You and You alone)
You gave me some place to start
To start over again
It's You

I was looking for hope in my dim lit ideals
Thinking I might stumble onto something that's real
But so many years of being so blind
Of holding my own of saying I'm fine
Then You gave me faith not of my own
And it brought both the peace and hope like I'd never known
You said You'd forgive if I would believe
That You were the Son of a God yet unseen

And it's You, Jesus (only You and You alone)
You gave me faith to believe
And the mercy to see
That it's You, Jesus (only You and You alone)
You gave me all of my worth
By loving me first
It's You

And it's You Jesus
You gave me all of my worth
By loving me first

Gone are all the endless summer days

Though the storms will surely come
So let me ask you can you look to sky
And strain to see the sun again

You harbor the hurt and you shelter the pain
Too proud to ever confess fallen again
But don't you long for mercy's tender embrace

Remember the words you spoke from you heart
Its a pity those phrases have fallen apart
Gone is every promise that you made

You ran when then shadows grew long

PFR,"Daddy never cried, he just turned away
Never showed the side that was soft as clay
What a weak reply
You live inside a blanket of blame

Why would you need a gift of pardoning
Until your sin becomes your own?
Soon comes inevitable reckoning
Then you'll understand
Just how much true love can change a man

Daddy never cried, will not work today
Put your pride aside, we all need grace
Somewhere deep inside
What you love is what you need to hate

When will you stop blaming somebody else?
You make decisions on your own
You choose to leave the truth for nonsense
Do you understand
Just how much the truth can change a man?

It's off to work and then home again
She wonders if this will ever change
Clutching her pillow, she hides in a dark
Room in her heart

How long has it been
Since love touched her and she let in
Chased out the shadows, filled emptiness
With her head in her hands, she cries
""Come back again, I need you, my friend""

We fight on our knees but don't often see
The battles that rage being won
But fight on, we will and tarry until
Love comes to carry us on
To kneel with the broken in spirit
And call upon the Son

So many holes here within
Torn apart and then blown by the wind
Hell and high water come crashing in
Pride says to fight but he cannot defend
This means to an end

The truth cuts like a blade
Bleeding all of the plans that he made
Nothing but faith in the One who came
Can ever bring peace to the spirit again
Will he understand?

We fight on our knees for those who might see
The battle is over, it's won
Not by our hands, by the Son of man
He who is has overcome
Death and the grave hold no power
To those who call upon the Son

We fight on our knees but don't often see
The battles that rage being won
But fight on, we will and tarry until
Love comes to carry us on
To kneel with the broken in spirit
And call upon the Son

pg. 99,"This is where it starts, when we all just fall apart, 
A hole in my head widens, my brain is drying up, where it shows,
Everyone can see it but no one knows, 
Offering them flowers in my minds rose, 
But in my heads windows, the cold wind grows and birds explode, 
I wrote my name in the snow before the ocean froze, 
I am so blown off, outgrown and froze.",Friendship

I had lost all my sense of direction
But you, you heard my midnight calling
You stopped me when I was falling
Your love rescued me

There's never been a time in my life
I can't remember when everything 
Felt so right
I'm felling good cause I've got you
And you've got me, no need for fantasy
'Cause I lose control with just

[Chorus]
One touch
And you've got me
Spin into frenzy
Dance of love and praises
One touch
And you've ignited
A world so exciting 
When you lay your hands on me

You gave me love without condition
When I was trapped by man-made traditions
And you tell me every time I pray
That you will always listen
And help me find my way

I need your love in my life
When the wrong I would, I would do
Keeps me from the light
Lord be my strength 
In all I do
I give my heart to you
And lose control with just

To all who've been born of the Spirit

And who share incarnation with him;
Who belong to eternity, stranded in time,
And weary of struggling with sin.

Now we have got to get out of here
In our darkest hour
Where we may not make it

I can't see a thing through the smoke
And if i could breathe I'd try not to choke
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, nowhere to go

I burn at the end, I learn to regret
Just one toss of that faithful cigarette

It's expected!

So panic...

It's time to lose control!
Turn off your radio!
You're gonna feel alright!
Let's do the panic tonight!

This place is turning upside down,
And shaking all of our change out,
And Charlotte's tossing her hair to the hounds
But it's her head they want on the wall
Right next to the screeching owl,
And I don't like this party
Or the sound
Of people walking across you when you're down.
And that's it!
So panic.

It's time to lose control!
Turn up your radio!
Yeah you can bring your friends!
So we all do the panic again!",Do the Panic

Had cut my eye as I wiped at my face

I gave a call to the crisis line

Like a few we had before
And when this evening's over
I will search this one for more

It's too much too often
Out of the cradle

Pharoah Sanders,"I got so much trouble on my mind  
That it feels just like I'm always sleeping with the enemy 
But I know the real world always gets the last word 
And that's why you gotta kick reality
So don't tease me and try to say I should care 
I might as well go out for mine 
'Cause everybody's going out for theirs 

So don't tell me about a fake drug war 
Go cut education programs more 
The people will one day learn and rise 
'Cause not everyone is out to score 

People always ask me why people are all fucked up 
At every corner liquor store",Memories of Lee Morgan
Pharoah Sanders,"Beginners luck, white legs
In and out, of a sleep 
Behind the wheel, black eyes 
Like to scream, you do if you can feel

the glass breaks, glass shattering
Find your angel, lose your hobby
Everybody, you gotta do something right
If you find love hold on tight

don't push, your love away
Don't push, your love away

then on the walk on my way back home
I get a call from a friend on the telephone
He says come here I've got this girl to see
But beware, love isn't always free
Upon first glance, I got so hungry
Forbidden fruits, you gotta taste them
I took one bite, we all take chances
Poison lips, doomed romances

don't push, your love away (don't push your love away)
Don't push, your love away (don't push your love away)

a kiss of death, on the door
That's what you get, for takin home a whore
I shouldn't say that, it doesn't sound nice
Faith removes my fear sometimes
I'm too shy, you're too sharp
Together we can work eachother out
Loves too quick, she's always been
We're in your bed, drunk with adrenaline

don't push, your love away (don't push your love away)
Don't push, your love away (don't push your love away)

and I can see better days
We can share, love can save
You can hide in yourself
We can go our separate ways

and I've seen better days
Pass me by in a haze
And we've seen better days
Pass us by in a haze
I've seen better days

don't push your love away

Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

In the corner clutching they genitals by the dresser
A hundred cc's of the uncut cleanest
In the vein, twenty-four hours of intravenous
To the left, we have right wing extremists
On a screen a man exposes his breasts with no penis

Yo yo I feel like I'm one of the livest
One of hip hop's finest, elite rhymers
And I plan to graduate with honors
But one day we'll all be a bunch of old-timers wit Alzheimer's 
Looking at our label's roster wondering how the fuck they forgot us
After we done recorded dozens of albums
And made 'em hundreds of thousands of dollars, they still dropped us
We giving niggas what the fuck they want
A holocaust, stomping niggas with a Thousand Man March
I ain't living in hell, hell's living in me
That's why I'm always screaming on you fucking emcees
The shit that I quote, float wit the buoyancy of a boat
With the potency of a scorpion sting to the throat
Overdose that's extremely fatal
Doctors in white lab coats scramble for an antidote to save you
You can't breathe, your chest feels painful
Your skin color's going from dark brown to beige-blue
Your whole room's full of angels
All in your ear trying to tell you which God you should pray to
You pray to Jesus, but He don't want to save you
'Cause you unfaithful, so He gives you to Azazel
You're paralyzed on the operating table
Praying for Canibus to slice you from head to navel
You banned from TV, banned from CD's
Banned from DVD's and downloadable MP3s",Hell

It was like the earth twisted around her
She shifted the ground I was like, ""oh, shit!""
She's off the hook, I would dress her decently
But look her body is immaculate I'm attackin' it from all positions
Of thinkin' inside my mind-ah
Hopefully it won't be too inappropriate if I walk over there and say
""Excuse me, can I have your number please?
I'll get on my knees if I have to""
She'll laugh through, the whole episode
Just then I knew I had her locked (Down)
No cock-blocking please this one's mine (Uh)

Every line of mine was like a rhyme I wouldn't lie I swear
Sparklin' the whole time as I whispered in her ear

Slash b-boy gentleman but, let me introduce myself
Also begin, so that you can further understand what I say
I took this last swallow of the Grand Marnier
And slid her to the dance floor, now she like ""wow""
Oh, damn, money got style
Funny how things change when you got a liquor in ya
You're quicker with the tongue, givin' me rhythm now huh
Block the music and the people out to admire the love
The nerve of us, impervious to the entire club
And like marijuana shotguns let's blow this joint

First impression, to be discrete, use discretion
Back of the cab undressin', uh-huh
I'm here witchu, sorta like our bond spiritual
All night, all I could do, is stare at you
Cracked the window and the Alize on the Palisades
Right before she told me her name was Valerie
Her crib was just a mile away, nothin' to my salary
She could serve me pain all night and I could tolerate
I'm her horizon right, but in the night though

Astonishin the way he used to handle the pill God (word?)

Thinkin', ""This time, next year, mom'll be able to, oh!""

Well get the metal out, too late, the guns flash
In the melee they wet him like Reggae Sunsplash
Sun dashed with the quickness, back into the ride

Blood comin from his mouth, now I'm at his side

Through unoccupied dimly lit staircases and rape it

Never waste time, I give the verse rabies

Ditch the body parts off somewhere near the crescendo

Get the fuck up
Simon Says get the fuck up
Put your hands to the sky
(Bo bo bo bo bo)
Brooklyn in the back shooting craps now what's up
Girlies, rub on your titties
Fuck it, I said it, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

Yo, where you at, uptown let me see 'em
Notorious for the six-fives and the BM's
Heads give you beef, you put em in the mausoleum
And shit don't start pumping till after 12 pm
Uh, ignorant minds, I free 'em
If you tired of the same old everyday you will agree I'm
The most obligated, hard and R-Rated
Slated to be the best, I must confess the star made it
Some might even say this song is sexist-es
Cause I asked the girls to rub on their breast-eses
Whether you're riding the train or a Lexus-es
This is for either or Rolies or Timex-eses
Wicked like Exorcist, this is the joint
You holding up the wall then you missing the point

Get the fuck up
Simon Says get the fuck up
Throw your hands in the sky
(Bo bo bo bo bo)
The Bronx is in the back shooting craps now what's up
Girls rub on your titties
I said, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

Pharoahe Monch,"Yo
Truth had me up against the ropes 
And semi-conscious without no boxing skills
Fear of it makes hair on my neck grow like minoxodil
Watchin' the clock is ill when, faced wit the truth
Parallels observing, amateur video tapes of
Twenty-one top notch NYPD cops get ill
Fill they minds not to kill still son, never revealed
True feelings, we speakin' on the truth right now in itself is a healing
See The Creator, created existence and balance
At right angles, unless it was conceived and stated
So whoever shall stray away from right lives wrong
The deliverance of the word false opposite of truth off course
Sure as my slave name sending
Troy Donald Jamerson paves the path, enabling truth
To stay stable and cling to earth!
Sorta similar to the way static electricity sting see
Truth brings light, light refracts off the mirror
Visions of yourself and error could never clearer
The truth is that you ugly, not on the outside
But in the inside on the outside you frontin' you lovely
The discovery of these things and all are well-hidden
But when you in denial of self it is forbidden, that's the truth

In due time we will find

Let the truth be told from young souls that become old
From days spent in the jungle, where must one go
To find it, time is real, we can't rewind it
Out of everybody I met, who told the truth? Time did
We find kids speakin' 'cause it's naturally in us
But the false prophets by tellin' us we born sinners
Venders of hate, got me battlin' my own mind state
At a divine rate, I ain't in this just to rhyme great
See the truth in the thighs of a stripper, the eyes of my nigga
If it's only one, then why should it differ
So constantly I seek it
Wonderin' why I gotta drink a six pack to speak it
Took a picture of the truth and tried to develop it
Had proof, it was only recognized by the intelligent
Took the negative and positive, 'cause niggas got to live
Said I got to get more than I'm given
'Cause truth'll never be heard in religion
After searchin' the world, on the inside what was hidden
It was the truth

Truth, truth, truth, truth, truth, truth
In due time, we will find

Check it, on my neck I still got marks from the nooses
The truth it produces, fear that got niggas on the run like Carl Lewis
The truth is my crew is the smoothest bits of saliva juices like the roots is
More organic than acoustics
Heavenly, what will set you free and kill you in the same breath
That shit you gotta get off your chest before your death, unless
The way you speak is lighter than a pamphlet
'Cause the truth give the words away to the planet goddammit
I ran wit what God planted in my heart and I understand it
To be the bring the light to the dark, breathe some life in this art
This must be the truth (why?) 'cause we keep marchin' on (True)
The truth lay the foundation of what we rockin' on (True)
You can't see it if you blind but we will always prevail (True)
Life is like the open sea, the truth is the wind in our sail
And in the end, our names is on the lips of dying men
If ever crushed in the earth, we always rise again
When the words of lying men sound lush like the sound of a violin
The truth is there, it's just the heart you gotta find it in

You will find
You will find
You will find
You will find
You will find
You will find
You will find",The Truth

In the midst of the calm, the witty

Yo shut the fuck up!
Luck said shut the fuck up!
Bitches in the back, like crack get it cut up
I speak on behalf of them broads you call stuck up
Act like a man and get cocked, smacked or fucked up
Pull the truck up, Luck you know the name
Ass out in the bleachers stay shittin' on the game
I suppose what you're spittin' is flames, cowards
Knew your crew was vaginal, I could smell the dooch powder
Summer's Eve, I drop degrees chill
Come four by four, lose one like Dru Hill
Stay fly 'til you air sick, now that's ill
Two choices, either squeeze or peel, now that's real

What the fuck's goin' on here, just a minute now, hold up
Sinister wit hit the time I diminish him finish him, roll up
When I'm, in a, cinematography state of mind
My rap trip, rip, flip, clip, say the rhyme
Shit, I spectacular run hit spit bitches vernacular
Miraculous rhyme flow, back track to the Immaculate
Binaca blast nigga that's fast, son I'll out-box ya
Ladies rub the ta-ta's, bras, titties and knockers on the floor
Owww! Fellas pull ya cock out
On the verge to splurge verbs for third round knock out
Uh I bust a rhyme that dust frustrated rappers
Dust crush competition, lights out like the Clapper
The mic ripper, whip a nigga like a slave
Separate him from him from his fam, he don't know how to behave
Now, drag his ass, bag dun for his loot
Figure me to give a nigger-y twenty-one gun salute
That's seven shots for 2pac
Seven for Biggie Smalls
Seven for Freaky Tah up in your neighborhood malls
How's that, fat action packed rap remain tame
Pharoahe fuckin' Monch, ain't a damn thing changed

Yo yo get the fuck up!
Funk Doctor Spock said get the fuck up!
I got a bitch named Nina and I tuck her
I leave a nigga hangin' like ya mom's muffler
Snuff her, then my boys follow up
Respect like The Fonz, you see the collar up
I spit out a bullet, load the barrel up
I kamikaze ya town off a Arab bus
Karat cut, yeah mami pull over
I bend ya pussy like for years I knew yoga
I'm too smoked up, I can't remember me
Off Hennesy, that's why I carry Mini-Me
I need fifty feet when my performance starts
I push a armored car wit enormous hearts
Nineteen inches, I'm not on the charts
Doc turnin' dark off a warning shot
Drive off and pop, six in ya hood

Yea-yeah my nigga, one rhyme and you fold over
I'm hot-headed 'cause I walk with cold shoulders

Walk through Shaolin after dark, you get stuck up
Seek and destroy, baddest boy when I'm puffed up
Ya know my name, and Pharoahe Monch, why we came what?
We off the chain, plus we plottin' on the game, what?
Know ya role, by the way tuck ya gold
And you and your mic can ease on down the road
Assholes are like opinions, everybody got to have one
Shootin' in the sky tryin' to blast sun
Zero to sixty in a second, pull a fast one
Fifty cent flashin' they hate us with a passion
Mashin', still fresh in three-day old fashion
Your plaid, I'm stripes, together we be clashin'
Here's a Tunnel banger
Wu-Tang death penalty, the gas chamber
This gon' hurt me more than it hurts you
Slap ya like the doctor the day your momma birthed you
Just so you can feel me
The same way I'mma feel this world when it kill me
Even if time stands still, I'mma still be
Underground and filthy, gotta have our Way like the Milky
Innocent until I'm proven guilty
Never got caught in the game of tag
Momma never kept a boyfriend with kids this bad
No justice, raider ruckus
Underground 'til we under ground
But y'all first motherfuckers

My thugs, throw up ya set
And shorties rub on ya breasts
Get the fuck up, outta that dress, I palm tits
You herbs get flipped like jeeps on mountain cliffs
I'll rip through your chest, hollow-point talent tips
Double-S, double the threat, double your bet
Double up on that cash if you decide to invest
You sound like Big, you sound like Jay, you sound like D
And I bet, when I go plat, you'll sound like me
Shabaam Sahdeeq, injure your fleet into delete
Y'all crabs are weak, frail like a fiend's physique
I stay on the street, stay on the beat, stay with the heat
Stay stickin' fools like you for the rocks that gleam
So toss that link, dummy, shoulda insured that link
Straight to Canal I'll praise that link, then pawn that link
You froze up, Sahdeeq says shut the fuck up
Punk niggas get gun-butt up and tied up

Busta Rhymes is like Hacksaw Jim Duggan, been thuggin'
Lovin' the way we flood jewels for nothin'
Lay it over, another ambush we take over
Yo we don't only get money, we cut the coke and cook the shake over
You better guard your head right, especially if it's late at night
Or find your picture of your autoposy up on the web site
Yo if you ever violate my space
Fuck a fat lip, I'll leave you with a fuckin' fat face
Nigga, Busta Rhymes the handsome, I'll hold you for ransom and some
Like the ghost of a haunted house, I'll forever live in a mansion
Bitches, snitches comin' out and you know who's showin' it
Like when British civil servants pass secrets to the Soviets
Y'all niggas is seemless blends of seemless friends
Live on about the souls on a bunch of seamless ends
Collosal, me and my nigga Pharoahe Moncho
The head honcho, gettin' this money like Leonardo (Do-Do-Do-Do)
Enough substance in the roughness
Now watch it come around in an amazing large abundance
Now let me clear the smoke screen you blow fiend
Live nigga shit that'll rebuild your whole self-esteem
Pledge allegiance to the flag of united live niggas of America
Let us control and own the fuckin' area
Wildin' in your whip until you crash the whole truck up
And if you know what's good for you nigga you better get the fuck up!",Simon Says [US Remix]

My life is all I have to give
Damn you that lost the will to live

Pissed on the motherfucking White House lawn
I threw a rock, then I ran
Cause I couldn't stand anymore within the grip of the man
Y'all want to ask me who's sane
These biological gasses are eating my brain
Its a political grab bag to rape mother earth
Thirty seconds after they bagged dad for what he's worth
Thousands will die now so millions can smile later
This ain't the +Rockford Files+ nigga
They stockpile data for satellites
Where you discuss who's style is greater
In this killing pool you playing it cool like Kyle Jada
When ya'll ready to rock like Led Zep and Al Qaeda
With weapons of mass destruction an hour later
What's your identidy today?
You on some John F. Kennedy or Timothy McVeigh?
This Henessy done left me with a remedy to spray
For my identity your life is the penalty to pay

Just tryin' to win 
Just tryin' to win 

Its not a Vietnam song
I know women from desert storm who came back deformed
Missin limbs and disease and they legs is numb
Chemicals twice as strong as agent orange
Its messages in the bass drum
War goin off in your mind
No man is safe from
Its not a Game Boy about the PlayStation
Its ""Resident Evil"" when every President's a mason
Robbin y'all fools like ?
And y'all inherited roots and don't know how to retrace them
Place them back
Face them facts
Disgraceful, faceless, tasteless acts
Pharoahe takes the authorities to court
Peep crime before it happens like ""Minority Report""
And I will never be mentally defenseless
Cats be on the block, in the hood in the trenches sayin'

But they rap lackluster shine
My shit busts like Busta Rhymes sniffin' lines of coke, ""Woo Hah!""
That's all she wrote
On the quest to qualify for these inquisitive quotes
Quirk ass M-C's be as Queer as Folk
Talkin' about, ""Nigga can rap""
No shit Sherlock, y'all just can't see me like Matt Murdoch
I'm the pinnacle rhyme kid and any line of mine is criminal mind
And I blind 'er with original rhyme shit
Fall in line with the sick, cynical grime shit
Clinically approved for you to move your behind with
Timeless are world girls who get inspired with Pharoahe

Get 'em up, it's that
Put 'em up, it's that

Send one of 'em back in time just to get rid of me

I glisten man, stop snitching man
You use sex to sell, your Nextel to Sprint
Everything you represent is immoral
Cingular, not plural
You and your Sidekick get rid of that whack Trio
I freeze M-C's zero degrees below
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
You need to get loose, to the heat of produce
From Long Beach to Boston
Your chicks text us like Dallas and Austin

But you get back up, get on your journey

Yeah, keep on pushin'
Pushin', pushin', pushin', ooh

And pushed my struggles, endured my pride
I fear no man, I know wrong from right
We push until the day we see the light

And we keep on pushin'

My accurate jabs connect like rotary
Make you notice me, be like damn, dudes on some totally
When he rides the bass line like Ginobili

I'm vocally unmatched, globally with the flow
Slow on the ground but more public than notary
Push, in this era of G.W. Bush
We must load mental ammunition and bust, thus

I'm a hold you down, I got you
One more repetition, I'm a spot you
This is for my blue collar workin', beer guzzlin'
Bootleg, D-V-D sellin', keep hustlin?, push

If you represent the struggle, then push
Peep the pieces of the puzzle and push
Never let 'em place a muzzle, just push

I got wisdom to teach you

For diamond it scarred her deeply 
Plays like a offender bass
To my self I thought how much does gender play
Remembering such hatred at this tender age 
If I could send a mental page
My thoughts would end the rage
Reminiscent of the looks to her in class 
I gave my eyes would say

[Chorus]
Hold on, I'm sure
There's so much more, to live for
If you hold on, things'll change 
So c'mon be strong 
And hold on, I'm sure 
There's so much more, to live for
As you grow strong things'll change
No pain, no gain

Please be willing to fight for your will despite 
Writings from William lynch
Millions tried to rise like helium
But died in the fields and the trenches
Cries from the killing is senseless
Eyes to the ceiling it quenches 
A thirst in the feeling that's endless 
The prize like a rain that rinses
The soul and cleanses ya mind 
From white picketed fences 
Heads up your ass, splinters and face
Meant to they ride and bench us
The masters pastured disaster 
Them fascious bastards 
They crafted this hazardous plan and still has a spoken advantage
We shoulder the struggle 
With the wieght of a boulder that muffles 
The sound of provocative thinking the pieces of puzzles
Incompleted,
Only deleted to be push to the back of ya mind 
Like a hairline that has receded 
Now we repeated, 
The process but never weeded the problem out
Heeded the warnings but never proceeded to solve it
No forward progress, its obvious the soul is gone, 
I meditate and pray that these words will somehow allow you to

[Chorus]

See now diamond is priceless, 
Timeless how she maneuvers like Heimlich
In this new world it reminds me of isis
She knows now that her complexion is a holy device
A protection from U-V rays in this negative time of crisis 
Like a knife that butter slices 
Easily to anger she reacts pious 
Like a cell protectin' itself from a virus
Twice as strong as her demeanor 
Now she is Righteous
God is what you see now 
When you peer inside her iris 

[Chorus]

Diamond your so beautiful 
You can change this world 
If you want to girl oh 
Ooh
Come on 
Grow strong",Hold On

Who expressed that I left my cell phone in the studio
Right underneath the disc with the Pro Tools
Next to a six pack of O'Douls and some soul food

Exit the expressway to use the payphone

See, I can play games too

Made a deranged mind out of someone in your same crew

With the same outfits, forty deuce
Takin' flicks like what, shit
Why did you fuck my wife, man?
You should've took my life, man

The sweat accumulated on his forehead, I saw red, he said
Now was it worth it, man?
Was it everythin' you imagined? Was it perfect?

And to believe those vile set a precedence
From the start I should have been obvious, I never did

Prevalent, the wicked debauchery and decadence
Was carried out with such masterful excellence
And this is the stick where you rip my heart
It was natural to transform murder into art

Before dirt was tossed on me, come to find out
Old friend of mine she sleepin' with committed the crime
In the past three years, switched identities six times

And all the while I'm devoted to love and loyalty
They plotted on my publishin' checks and royalties
She's thinkin' it's true love, he's scammin' her for the quop
? to devise my own intuitive plot

Put the pros on him, launched the probe on him
Now harm him, pen him, get him exactly where I wanted him
Cornered him, now his mission is aborted
You are about to be professionally extorted

Guess who you're 'bout to murder tonight?
Miss pretty brown eyes while she sleeps under the moonlight
Do it and bounce, the keys to the crib, you'll find under the mat
In the front of the house, just do it, word out

They murdered Amadou Diallo
They murdered Timothy Stansbury

No more! no more! no more! no more!

I got so much trouble on my mind, refuse to lose
Here's your ticket (uh), hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to Black
Attack so I sat and japped, then slapped the Mac
Now I'm ready to mike it (huh)
Hear my favoritism roll ""Oh""
Never be a brother like to go solo
Lazer, Anastasia, maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm livin', forgiven, what I'm givin' up
X on the flex (hear me now)
I don't know about later
As for now I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man I've had it up to here
Gear I wear got 'em goin' in fear
Rhetoric said, it read just a bit ago
Not quittin', it signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from gettin' jerked
Changin' some ways, to way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold, never follow the code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am, God knows
Cause it's comin' from the heart
What I got better get some (um hum)
Hustler of culture
Snakebitten, been spit in the face
But the rhymes keep fittin'
Respects been givin', how's ya livin?
Now I can't protect a pad off the defect
Check the record of reckon
An intentional wreck
Played off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall, broke the laws

Known as fair square, throughout my years

Drop the LP, many hit like Nesbula
7 years later, it's the year of the Gods
United States government is just the facade
The Catholic church got ties with the Mob
I see it all like ""The Wizard of Oz""
Now there's a yellow brick road, the fame which is yours
If you only had a brain, you would know who you are
Poison your ventilation, cut your education
Secret information, world domination
Take over reservations
Trigger the energies in the oceans for tsunamis to control the population
Eyes of the sky, hit an observation
If your over 65 we'll take over your medication
Like give me that (give me that), form a line (form a line)
Go to war (go to war), press rewind
Cause when I get mad, I put it down on the pad
Give you somethin' that you never had
Controllin', fear of high rollin'

And when I kill kids, they say shame on me
Who the fuck told you to put they names on me?

White man made me venom to eliminate
Especially when I'm in the hood, I never discriminate
Just get in 'em, then I renovate
Flesh, bone, ain't nothin? for me to penetrate

Was not fired from a six story window

Individuals in order to force people to adhere to one way of life
An independently funded organization called (garbled speech)
Hired 100 assassins to infiltrate the headquarters where files were kept
Of these 100, 97 were captured, tortured, and executed
Only three remained
The third of which was said to own an arsenal
That would rival an entire city's police force
The second was rumored was to be able to move throughout space and time
And the first

Fasten your seatbelts for the last of the three assassins on Earth
The first flashin' her purse with a heat stealth
They call me Jean McCoy, the beast in me employed
To ploy deplorable through audibled, destructive actions attractive to Coy
Hey, pass to the Troy after, I'm passing your life over
He'll deliver it through river sticks, Hades, I'm cold, deliver it lady

Blistering lines packed in six stick to spine
Rap with a sick mind trapped in thick bitch frame
Drug you with strychnine and I drinks you drunk and it's my kidney you dick
Brain?I'm just itching to slit veins
Stitch lines! Rip game!? Fuck yo lives
Sick range visions nigga, kick rocks or kick rhymes until the pain?

Ignorant as ever, she clever, equivalent be none

You got the gall bastard to brawl with the broad bashers?
The ball's in your court, pass it!
You're worn in four faster than acid
With AIDS slapped on the back of a Kardashian
The wall crasher, you're all in the forecast
The gas pour in the corridors racking your doors blacking out
Catch Grae backing out the back door, cacklin'
Still make it back to the bar for last call

Monch is a mixture of Marcus Garvey, Miles Davis, and Bob Marley

Specifically the fits so when I spit it's spectacular and accurate
When I attack I'm more like Acura
Flip Bloomberg the bird, bitch, more blood than Blacula
More Christian scriptures encrypted with backwards vernacular
But sicker than most of Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction
I am, that nigga for real
Per capita smackin' the next rapper that uses the term ""swag"" or thereafter

She know my stroke is deadly so she gave me bloody brain
Don't try to get familiar, if I don't feel you in person

We were told that the hell below was a firey inferno
I rediscovered my soul between the lines inside my journal
Trapped in a pen state of mind yo paternal
External gratification is not happiness eternal
Interject, intellect, intercept, internet
A slave majority where 5% benefit
PhotoShop amateurs, retouched photography
Pornography, sodomy, child labor economy
Put away your hope, same political policies
2010 only minus the Space Odyssey
It's gotta be a better way, we pray to hit the lottery
We all need a the-rapist...
For the robbery of our God and official public apology
An angel plotted to have organized confusion
You fell for the delusion, I'll expose the movement

Professional analyst, rhetoric, ramblin'
Symbicort, Advair, Albuterol, Ambien
I change the channel on commercials when I'm channelin'
Everybody's a star, lights, cameras
Seventeen thousand times a day the human eye blinks
Making us even more subjectable to the hijinks
IPhone, iChat, who gives a fuck what iThink?
One world currency, doesn't matter where I bank
There is no pot of gold at the end of a mythical rainbow
We're uneducated contestants, life is the game show
Your leader is the host, the results are painful
The judges weave a web in which we all get tangled
Their only contribution to the world is a delusion
Which has no physical power, I offer you a solution
Pharoahe Monch the antonym for translucent
Lyrical revolution, I'll expose the movement
Illusion

[Chorus]

They're never gonna let you see it
'Cause if they did, we'd all be free, yea

I said I ain't gangsta even though I grew up in the hood
I just wanna feed my people, so misunderstood
Strugglin (strugglin), hustlin (hustlin), tryin to make it right
I just wanna spread the light to help us free our minds

Well oh yeah, you are now in tune to www.fuckthemmotherfuckersradio
Where you will only hear racial shit

E plural pursued 'em, all seein eye, ocular exam
The Apocalypse, back by popular demand
Innocuous but still leave a stage with blood in my hand for the populous
Put a fist in the sky
""Licensed to kill"" italicized into my ID or ""Rocky Illuminati""
Haile Selassie Karate, John ""The Beast"" Mugabi
King Jaffe in the lobby with the fur made of a lion
The eye of hoarse mouths, I am vibrant
Prominent constellations of Orion (whoa!)
The reason why my stars are in alignment (uh)
The renegade, Allahu Akbar, rock star
Tossin homemade grenades, CD's at NYPD cop cars
Just to get the revolution to pop off
Fraudulent stock, funded with Louis Vuitton knock-offs
Hijackin helicopters, detonate your metropolis
While I'm in the cockpit, politicin like Stephanopoulos
And my esophagus is quite atomic when I vomit
It's bioengineered urbanonomics
The formula truth divided by innovative ebonics
Times smooth lime, crushed ice and a splash of tonic
Nigga my past lies are astronomic
Smokin hash in a cathedral with Nostradamus
At mass, discussin Martin Luther's ""Free at Last"" speech
Step on my British Walkers get your ass beat

Some people say I'm extreme broadcast to beams
Live to the means
Screaming as Jimmmy Ivy
Corrupt as Don King
Boxed into the ghetto
To be the champion of bling
Industry is the arena the internet is the ring
You trained the artist from queens
Swing me at the fiends?
Def Jam supreme team the same thing
Except more it's more critical now
It's digital Cocaine
The goal is to control every individual brain
Like Cadillacs for contracts in the sixties
The contract 3-60
The trick?
Switch to degrees of 3 6s
You see who receives the riches
Which is the reason why they is only a few moguls
Clover the pioneer left in a chokehold
Enough to make the individual 
Watching these old folks get fucked for their vocals

What's the ratio for radio play at your station?
If you are not paying to play your record is dead
Puts a whole new spin on Radiohead
They gotta 1000 plays a week
We selling the same units
They put their best rep up
The couldn't stand next to it
People wanna relate they wanna connect to it
Here's a lyrical check
Is this enough for you to flex to it
Huh?
Or do you need more clues
Should I be more black
Would that change your view?
Should I dye my hair blonde should my eyes be blue
Just a couple more questions I mustered up for you
These are 11 inch shoes you can't fill those
I make headlines like corduroy pillows
And probably get banned from television and marketing
Targeted by music industry the politic provocative

Call me the hitman

It's kinda hard
Let's release sex tapes so we can become stars
Nude photographs of titties and asses
Impress the masses
I thought she was supposed to be so passive
Now you just another ass in the air with an asterisk
Cell phone songs, you'll never be a classic
They call that remastering?
What does it have to be so drastic?
Chemical skin pill makes it sound more plastic
Follow the program man
Stick to the classics
They want Slap stick
Before it all goes tisk-tasket
This might take a few you listen
Before you grasp it

Huh, we need a leader who is not mischievious
Devious, from satan's grip to lead us
Won't retract the facts then act facesious
In fact the racks are packed with facts that teach us
Reach us, easily leave MC's speechless
Read from the palm of the non-believers
Some of them wonderin how they become underachievers

I got it, You want it, come get it so i'll flaunt it
And I will show you away

Knowing it's hard times for the people huh
I'll knock your ass unconcious
Put it up on Youtube,then film the sequel so it's free for the people huh
Go on ahead and download it I'ma teach you how
P is a prophet, a pastor, a preacher
With undisputable logic for blasting through your speaker now
I'm tyng to learn your monk ass, I'm trying to reach you now
But still your like who's this dude
Return to fix, shape the game like Rubics cube
Chick seems brolic now ruthless too
Spit the gospel on wax, what he chooses to do
Damn
Open your eyes man you've been bamboozled
By the usual plans hit up the middle like Stan Musial
If y'all are telling me todays music is suitable and appealing
Then I'm telling you the feelings are not mutual

Who wants to see the crack of your ass and see your butt
You need to let it off, the people go
Past the collection plates and give me all of my dough

An old rusty ass .38 snub nose
And just because your thinking my shit don't work

Seven year old girl, shot and slain?
What does it all mean? We go insane
In the struggle, the stress make him asthmatic

Where I come from, no one runs when funds run low in lump sums
We chose to dump dumb dumb but live dunn dunn

Walk around hunchbacked or you might get hit (talk about it)

And these major labels are not listenin'
Stood in a B boy stace, teeth glistenin'
From the gold in his mouth, the summer breeze was whistlin'
I contemplated my retort, eyes fixed in
On a crucifix around his neck, I guess he was Christian
Just then, the police siren had pitched in
To the soundtrack of the hood, so I spoke with conviction
Spoke as if I was 6'10"" with thick skin
Put a little bass in my voice like pitchmen
Cause where I come from
Where I come from, we all come from
Sky, moon, the stars, the Earth and Sun
Multiple skin tones, your blood is one
The pen is the ammo to my automatic gun
Bring to fruition what I write to get me out of the slums
And I'm a shine, sh-sh-shine, shine, shine

And reach, the unborn to transform your mind

The new revolutionary is shyaman
It's not brush fire rap, it's five alarm
Motivational music after I am gone
My inner visions, mysticism call me Mr. Wisdom
They wanna turn the globe into a prison
And being sick is better than being dead
'Cause when you sick and in bed, you're indebted to meds
Cloned chickens walking around without heads
The food is contaminated, the water got lead in it
Population control, make the babies sick
All these 5G chips, are you for 86?

Controlling your soul, sort of a psychological dictatorship
And we are on the front lines
Guilty as charged if intellect is a crime

Alhamdulillah's a spiritual calling
My alternate and we are still mourning
It's not a documentary about global warming
This is lunar explosions of global warning
So when the moon leaves you can't tell night from morning
Cities submerged underwater post New Orleans
It's not your average rap recording
this is insane lieutenants taking aim at Mormons
While the American dream remains dead and dormant
My stimuli's supplied by my endorphins
The mind's eye greater than pi and broadband
I break on through to the other side without doormen
It's not The Doors, man
I am equipped with a better memory chip than dolphins
With more keys to open more doors than four foremen
To executive's rooms where they walking on all fours man
Canines standing upright amongst you
Hated by swine, spreading the H1N1 flu
On some rabies shit, are you for 86?

I'm like a vampire required to stay dormant
Out of the range, the sunlight with a dotted remain
I used to smoke so much weed that it clouded my brain
I took a break, had to find life's meaning again
Without the smoke in my lungs I started dreaming again
I dreamed of candy-coated cars and panties that go with bra's
Hurricanes named Sandy, I'm floating on Noah's ark, what?
Police'll bleed blue cause he staying true to the uniform
Dennis Rodman in North Korea looking for unicorns (that's ridiculous)
The truth is I'm one of the best

Morphine, gang bang, gangrene, slauson, swap meet
Meet greet, pop I don't sleep, I don't stop
I love hate, hate cops
That's why I laugh when you pull it

Brook'nam, you know we living in the jungle

See them gorillas over there in the park, them my niggas
After dark we get sparked up and pull triggers
You gotta speak orangutang slang or pull capers
The cops are the cheetahs and the trees are the skyscrapers
See in the jungle we often rumble for loot
Some of us just stumble around high off the booze, shoot
You get shot, shit
Play humble like last year when the cheetahs tried to catch my uncle
When you come through, you could get bumped too
If you don't got at least 4 to 5 gorillas amongst you
The bigger tree hit 'em shocked and amazed
41 shots hot, take you out in the blaze
And if not, they ship your ass to the Bronx in a cage
Into the island where you spend your time counting the days
But still agriculturally, it's kind of ill, we blow mills
They make a killing and build new lands in the jungle

Shaolin, you know we living in the jungle
Chi-town, you know we living in the jungle
Westside, you know we living in the jungle

I tell these chimpanzees who be carrying tools
You don't wanna invest your life in a cess pool
Pharmaceutical distributin', breaking the rules
You need to take your monkey ass off to school
And learn about Botswana, Sudan and Ghana
Mozambique and speak of pride and honor
I understand sometimes we all feel fenced in
But utilize your mind to define dimensions
Just then I lost the little monkey's attention
As he stared into the distance focusing on squinting at a
Beautiful gazelle that was grazing in the grass with
Muscular legs and a rhinoceros ass
But in the least case scenario I did try to tell him
Hit him with some signs that was a little compelling
Little Gibbon on a mission, not unlike Magellan
What you caught was some felons, crimes and drug selling in the jungle

Yo, Ghana, you know we living in the jungle
Cape Town, you know we living in the jungle

I'm talking epileptic episodes off that Epinephrine
That Albuterol and them other prescribed medicines
A zombie in insomnia frecking the Amphetamines
My moms had me smoking weed from the Netherlands at age 13
Broke apart the scene, a lot of moist weed that was sticky and green
See in the 80's it was wine-coolers and woolis

Mike Jackson, kick me, kike me, Jew me
Now all the white chicks in the world got booties

And a nigga nosey on some Toucan Sam shit

I used to write about green eggs and ham
'Til I found out the Food and Drug Adminstration was a scam
Now we steam vegetables, brown, forget the white rice

Lyrics bang now and again, sing like the Chi-Lites
It's my right to use my power to shine my light
To function, you know the function
Yo, Pharoahe Monch, what's your motherfucking function?
I go to Queens for queens, I eat organic in Brooklyn
Swing on a vine over the swine and keep 'em shook

Pharoahe Monch,"A clock without a minute hand
An hourglass without sand
Suspended within space and time
I walk a thin line
Amongst the masses all alone
A furnished house with no one home
I see through walls that’s hard to climb
I’m losing my mind

No medicaid, no medication
Thinking you're better off dead
Instead should have been dedicated to education
I spin, the cylinder on my revolver
I spin, the cylinder
Would someone explain who’d leave a dick in charge of a bush
Of a colon I’m screwed, saw more war than Warsaw Poland, viewed
An infant’s insides, outside of his body
Inside of a place of worship, ungodly
Out cries tears “Dear God, where are we?”
That’s what I scream towards the skyline but probably
No one can hear a word of what I was saying
Insurgents surged in the temple where I was praying
Now flashbacks wake me abruptly when police pass by
Lights flash, if i could only put the past on a flash drive I’d
For peace of mind, install an external drive
So I’d be more driven internally to survive I’m

A clock without a minute hand
An hourglass without sand

I spin, the cylinder on my revolver)
Amongst the masses all alone
A furnished house with no one home
(So I spin, the cylinder on my revolver
I suspend, the cylinder on my revolver)

My family customs were not accustomed to dealing with mental health
It was more or less an issue for white families with wealth
Void, I defected, employed self annoyed
Went independent, enjoyed stealth
Now doctors prescribed sedatives and Prozac
The rent’s cheaper in the ghetto but you can’t go back
So I, suspend the cylinder on my revolver
Then, maybe let it draw blood like Chupacabra
And dissolve into the abyss, without evolving
Instead of revolving around the habitual problem solver
Research like, George Washington Carver
But no answer so my mantra is to deal with it in and chart then
Part, instead of being incredibly defiant
Peddle through revenue issues I’ll do it for medical science
It’s better to be level-headed than to regret it and pious
Settling for life without sun-shine, never vibrant, I’m

A clock without a minute hand

Pharoahe Monch,"Fuck you know about struggle? The boy in the plastic bubble
When I drink away the pain I guzzle
My life is like a complicated mathematical puzzle, for real
Seen death twice, it's ugly motherfucker man
But you conversate with him when you suffering
He said, ""Let go of the pain, you'll never rock the mic again
Your choice slug to the brain or 20 Vicodin
I kinda likened it to Ortho Tri-cyclen
Disturbing the natural cycles of life and it's trifling
Fuck what you heard, less money more problems
4 years removed from the game with no alblum
I put the gun to my brain, but first I wrote a note to explain
Put the Luger in my head, and these are the words that I said

Sure as kingdoms rise the same kingdoms were sure to fall
And wash away like memories, as if they weren't there at all
Like broken limbs of trees that's lost its leaves to Winter's wind
Spring will come again
Live

When your cerebral ceases to administer silence
And the only faith you have left is a CD
From a singer who had a son with Christopher Wallace
Tomorrow is never
Hope is abolished
Mind and soul have little to no unity
Life threw a brick through my window of opportunity
My immune system lacked diplomatic immunity
When asthma attacks the black community
Where do you go from there?
Long walk, short pier
Thought I knew all it was just to know of the ledge
Till I glanced down at all ten toes on the ledge
Before I heard what sounded to me like a pledge
Emerged from the darkness, and this is what it said
Do not despair, breathe, fight
For there is more life to live, believe
More insight to share, retrieve
Was the dead at the illustrious
Exhale, hold, inhale, receive and live

Sure as kingdoms rise the same kingdoms were sure to fall
And wash away like memories, as if they weren't there at all
Like broken limbs of trees that's lost its leaves to Winter's wind

It's that cooked up coke, crack music
Black Thought and Pharoahe, the rap duet
It's that lucid rapid eye movement

My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure
Mega, reality, tera, giga
Grand Theft Auto, modern day Mickey and Mallory Small
But I'm sick enough to walk into an art gallery and piss on a Picasso
Crack statues, rub my balls on her face, shit on it, and throw it at you
So when the beat intensifies
I become emotionally desensitized
Like, once I slapped a rapper with mace
Then I spit acid in his face, after he rinsed his eyes, no wait
I actually grew five times my size grabbed
Ma$e by the thigh and slapped a rapper with him
Now that's practicing sacrilegious activism
Attack is for battle, and practical rap with wisdom
Actually, it's pragmatic capitalism for actors
that crack under pressure and collapse when I get 'em
Monch is medicinal man made medical marijuana
With a phase plasma rifle like I'm searchin' for Sarah Conner
And shorty's got brains, shorty not playin'
I'm 40 blocks I'm a killa with 40 watt range
With an arrangement of bullets that I've arranged
Encrypted in scriptures specific individual names
That shall remain anonymous
Me and the ammunition's in a relationship that's monogamous
It's like I'm married to the silencer
Until I file for divorce and release my ex-calibers
Do art with your arteries, place that for my adversaries
Put your snap back cap back, cap your capillaries like

Vocally twice as magnifying as ever hearing Chewbacca scream
Through a megaphone with the significance of Dr. King
Philanthropic
Cause I'm trying to see man united without referencing UK soccer teams
My philosophy prophecy, the opposite of Mephistopheles I incited isosceles
Sent to Earth to warn of environmental atrocities, and nobody can copy me
Stop, it's not possible but probable that it's only philosophical mockery, strange
Change copper to gold, switch properties, bang!
Stay on top of the globe, flip monopolies, aim
Take stock in the soul, spit properly

Take stock in the soul, spit properly
That extended clip on my hip sits awkwardly
I'm diabolical, follicle triggers that I cock and squeeze
Sending shots to ancient Greece to pop Socrates
I bear arms like button-downs without the sleeves
Manic depressive and possessive like apostrophes
My psychiatrist waive the doctor fees
When I wave the pistol and say listen quick, watchin' me so I can breathe
National Association for the Advancement
Of drugs for performance enhancement
And it's tough taking so many chances
But I've been a bad seed from the womb, they call me ovary cancer
And I got an ugly heart, although I'm totally handsome
And I take the love of your life and hold her for ransom
And my tactical cam that never stood for any national anthems
Was hood, I am the actual answer
And I'll prove it

I'm from a species that is higher, I am not human
Extraterrestrial alien, a monster killer of conscience chillin'
In a barrel of lobster

You be beatin' on my couches, why don't you try hit the drums
Look, oo you see me ma
They wish they could be me ma
As I got better, her body was eaten by Luchimia 
Seventh grade, it was cursed and sad
But the gift within it, was when I first met Chad
But even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed
'cause grandma Loucelle died on 12th 19th
I can't help but wonder, what kind of black cloud I was under
'cause 15 years later the other died that summer...bummer

[Chorus]
My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
So let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what).
See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes, until you in conversation it comes out in a line so let it
Out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), my nigga let it out

[Verse 2]
Aye yo, 10 21 Atlantis drive, nigga was action packed
That's Atlantis apartments, we live in half the back
That's where the 12 year olds there, they wbe flashing crack
And when they shoot you nigga, they ain't tryna pass it back
Aye yo, Diggy, Fleet and Marvian can you imagine that? 
The place we love the most, the hood was built to smash us flat
But I escaped 'cause I chased, what made me passion that
Now I got my skate team and spit these acid raps
So many niggas will rise
So many them niggas try
So many them niggas ended up duck-taped and tied
So many them same niggas, man they moms eyes cry
So, they just got older, still on the corner with they pride
Well let me tell niggas something, I'm so glad you alive
Long as you got a breathe, a pulse, nigga strive
Devine intervention this is
I heard a voice nigga, listen to this

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Jesus will arange it, but Jesus won't change it
Hold yourself responsible, on yourself you blame it
You mad, nigga don't articulate and ??, 
I.E. we best friends, speak best friends language
I'm a happy nigga, you can't approach me in anguish
Whoever said anything worth working for would be painless
Can't be mad at the world 'cause you and your girl ain't famous
'cause you both on bate, BBC and chainless
Also your rangless, therefore switch laneless
Now you brainless, dangerous, 'cause you pull out the stainless
All of sudden you smart, now you do something hainess
First time you get caught, now your ass is famous
No longer chainless, and the bus switching lanes is a bad look
Yo girl with ya man sellin' laneless, Stop
Nigga rewind and reverese slides 3 times
Reassess your thinking and trust me it'll be fine
First pitcure your goal, and repeat 'It'll be mine'
Or fuck it nigga, just keep imagine killin' me fine
Now you, scruntching your face tryna ace attainment
When you should be tryna find a place to base your shame, nigga
Success is taingeable, don't wait for fame
I thought you would receive it better if I ain't say ya name
You unsure of yourself, sit still and think
Review those actions if it fit, put your name in the blank

Yessur! aha 
New Skateboard P 
Hey! 
Let's go get 'em 
Uh-huh 
Yo, hola 

[Verse 1] 
Mearle maire, club muchacho 
Asorted flavours, in they solatos 
Inspire young minds, stacked by Nato's 
With the right determination of a patho 
Running 'cross the water with bricks at his poncho 
Face like a shoot when it's bussin' my glock hold 
Vanity stings, 'til I die when the holy father hands me my wings 
When I was young yo the teacher gave me stanity dreams 
Giving me music like drugs and they handed me things, they shoot it up 
See me on the TV, the cuties they wanna fuck 
Both presidential and plus, they hoop it up 
Got more hits in his zip, who want enough 
I can go back in time, you be Judge Eato 
With my men and ?? I know you thinkin' Neato 
Givin' peace to minutes, something like your T-Vo 
But it's 3 hundred thousand more with no remote 
Take it in the rain, I used to live with Tito 
But he clowned me and told me that my money's free-doughs 
Now the Enzo doors go up like a Dilo 
Reon, same song some from my man Nigo 
SLR, when the doors go up it's like a fresh elle jar 
Nigga we boss, he shall not get hot, he too frost 
Yessur... 

[Bridge] 
My nigga close your eyes, 
Just picture you're self just holdin' pies 
Impliment a plan and and you'll surely rise 
Just promised by the man that controls the skies 
Don't you see, I know that shit's so ill 
Better yet, dawg, just tell me how you feel 
...How you feel dawg? 

[Chorus] 
We just picture thinking, dreaming, scheming, breathing, reading, all in the late night 
Shaking, boiling, lacing, bacon, shaking, shaping, gotta get this cake right 
As I serve it, you just burn it, breathe it, learn it, now watch you take flight 
...My nigga how does it feel? 
Ha ha! Yessur! 

[Verse 2] 
Nigga you don't know me 
I'm part Howard Hues, part horny, part holy 
First trip on the ramp is the rock and rolly 
Keep one on my staff with a new pro-chromy 
If they priest need the mention that I've been biten 
But a force be the chocolate where critics are written 
He dresses insane where his music admire 
Ask anyone from Vouge and Esquire And Vanity Fair you like can of the year 
But you should guess who's in insanity chair 
Now it ain't about what I want 
Still thumbing through my life like a drug-star porn 
It's one thing to say you did it 
It's one thing to lie about your didgits 
It's one thing to say that you live it 
It's another for you fuckers to admit it 
But I admit I got all this paper plus the prettiest faces that's off of our nature 
I drive a Casper, s'cuse me Cassper, wanted meet me at my house, I got space like NASA 
And it'll make me happy buy yourself a Sattle 
Unlike my sister Stacy when she lost her papa 
I been there, gettin stroke and nothing to trap-uh 
John could do, when surrounded with true 
A man dies, baby born, as far as Peru 
It's a simple proof between us and imposters 
We hop in the air, and don't care what it costs us 
Now I'm with NERD with a pit full of Martians 
I guess you could say that we fly like saucers 
Zapping at niggas, with classing and figure 
The cash and class whippers 
The thrashing mag ripper 
Go 'head and say it (you a rappin' ass nigga) 
Yessur!

[Veres 1: Pharrell]
Before you say it's cheaper to keep her
We consider and read her
Man, she might be the type that want P to feed her
She wants a little cheaper, a little margarita
Mane, them draws comin' off when she see the two-seater
So put your Porche up, (uh)
Get your divorce up, (uh)
I'm sure she'll sign it when she seen me put my doors up
Mane, them niggas only wanna mother-fucker here
She threw her heels in the ocean, so she stuck to chill
The trunk is still, hopin' there's something between ya
Now she laughin' how she took your ass to the cleaners
Mane, I'm on your side, not tryna inconvient
Just know we got them mean keys in them plastic meaners
So keep it player dawg,
Don't make me say it, naw
Do something drastic, know that plastic heavy weighing, dawg
If it ain't music, or this money, I don't play at all
And she ain't either, so that means she doesn't weight at all

[Chorus]
Now we can both post sip or keep it playa mane
And we can both pull a misses, keep it playa mane
Or we grind our wrists and keep it playa mane
Or you can scram cocksuck if you a hater mane
I keep 'em ladies going uh-uh-uh,

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I'm a grown mane, Thug ain't the one to play no games with ya
Thug the one to call and come get out the chain with ya
And hang with ya, when ya full of Patrone
And oh yeah, brang one of ya cute partnas along
Because I'm only 25, and still going live
I got the estate by the pool, by the lake outside
I wake up and gotta pick which car I'ma drive
The Doubble R 760, or the 645, I'm
Havin' thangs, mane, check out the chain
Money aint never been a thang
You see watch and the rang (the watch and the rang)
Rocks the nicest, never seen nuthin' like this
I'ma Boss I on' ask what it cost, my life priceless
Baby girl you might just
Get the shatter shine
Long as you not selfish or learn to share sometimes
And of course I'm still you'res and you're still mine
But you can't be a hater, mane
You gotta keep it playa, mane

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
They say JLo shouldn't show her ass and all
Knowin' the worst thing could happen is a nigga could palm
Now my angent sayin' the only way that he could be calm
I put a hundred mil on each song, like my name was LaBron (whaa)
Not the ice, my beat is worth more
Attractive like a whole damn Jacob store
See niggas hate you more when you take they broad
But his girl looked in my ear and seen her matrix door
Dude's is foolish, they hues us to chew us
I mean, the smirfs, the green, the rocks is so bluish
You can't out bling me, or BBC jean me
You ain't got no vibe, you can go and ask MiMi
I think and relay it
I blink and PJ it

And all you Phantom owners know why you can't stand me

Never puffed a jay you ask lou shaun 
Back when he pushed babes like it was like coupons 
With a house full of dames like it was moulon

Leaves more oysters and pearls

Fresh 4-pack sittin in the freeza 
Ain't that kadeeja? I heard she was a Skeeza? 
She used ta hit them licks wit the Beezas 
Wen I seen her wit the homies, I was like ?JESUS!? 
It's been a lil min since I seen her 
Hope her man don't run up cuz ill have to pull the neena 

[Pharrell and Charlie:]
There's sumthin bout this girl 
From around my way 
Ever try to hold back ur feelings, 
But it just wouldn't stay? 
But when I finally found the words to say 
I wanted to run away 
Simply run away 

[Pharrell and Charlie:]
U can try to run and hide 
It wont make a difference 
U can lie to urself 
Of the reason 
Sure it hurts wen it comes to ur attention 
That ur in love with the girl

Aiyyo
Never in a million years I'll imagine I'll get my thrills
By listening to squeals of PJ wheels
As we land I duck down, I stick my head up my dick is
Being sucked down, by a bitch named what now
I look in her eyes, and her eyes are like an orange stars
Look at the reflection of my foreign car by are & are
I stick my feet out, you know the bapes that's made of eel
You know the new checks with nigo face right on the heel
I was a marching band, I was a skateboader
Jesus made wine, I couldn't make water
Ox-moronic, I'm here to destroy all you hate hoarders
You niggaz were cool in school now you niggaz take orders
I'm not dissin your job
But now you listen and nod
Some mount the limit shit, I know this position is odd

Don't Gasp for air
You can turn blue
Look, accel nigga
Trust me you can do it

[Chorus:]
You can do it too young blood
You can do it too young love
Just watch what you do young blood
And watch whose in your crew young blood
It don't matter if you do drugs,
And even if you threw slugs
You can do it too young blood
I did you can do it too

I know niggas are like there's no returning when I
Bought that white five-fifth
So white that the coke heads just might try sniff
I ordered the phantom coupe, that's smoke pipe grey
And the interior was like crack white beige
At least that's what it looked like when it was on that page
I combed the whole brochure and it did not say, oh well
Life's a bitch but not too extreme
Life's got a fat ass, Trust me I'ma fuck full steam
I make the world cream and scream, while I'm gettin my cream
I'm coming to America call me Prince Akeem, yes sir
It's kinda weird, 'cause this I dream
Kinda prophetic ya get it 'cause this I seen
These type of visions, since I's teen
I told my teacher what I saw, she said I missed byzine
Laughed with the class with the slightest clue
You be buying my shit, and I be rappin to you, but you can do it too

[Chorus]

I know you heard the story about the dude with the attitude
Pharrell he don't even know you but he mad at you
He got robbed and it seems he has a huge
He's frustrated and that it all he has is you
So, things propel and things excel
The next the a bing comes out the barrell
And my man they accused him of sittin tight up in jail
Ironic he close my man luke can hear him yell
I ain't do it but somebody dropped him flat
I felt the wind from it, that was God cocking back
I got a call from Virginia grandma went back
The line was fluctuated but it just now went flat
See her body went down and her soul went up
She sent angels around me so evil could not touch
I don't lie no more and I'm haunted when I fuck
Wealthy niggaz with a conscience, yeah you know what's up
The wires across, and it's breeding a plague
The conscience is hungry, and it's eating away
Trying to make sense of it, but it's speedy in vain
Up all night with the books and you read till the day
But still ya house of diddy 'cause you got a little paper
Push a cat in the corner, trust me it's the nature
Never underestimate the-things you do
Read your verse too, inhale the ""oo"", and go

Pharrell Williams,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

And you were there

When I first saw you, I got excited
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it
But I didn't know
I didn't let go
Then I realized I'm tryna fight it
Just so they can learn to ride it
But I didn't know
I had to let it go",Gust of Wind

In honor of the groove and all who's surrendered to it
We say thank you, and we take it back

We're so hard, I was so hard that they can't chew

Dans tes yeux et sur ton cœur
Pour pouvoir enfin te dire
Que de te voir c'est mon bohneur

L'absence habite dans ma maison
Où flottent encore toutes ces odeurs
Que tu laissais par déraison
Traîner partout comme des rumeurs

Avec qui tu vis avec qui tu dors
Est-il aussi gentil que moi
Quand avec lui du corps à corps
Fais-tu l'amour à haute voix

Est-ce qu'il t'écris de belles chansons
Avec un morceau de son cœur
Comme moi est-ce qu'il demande pardon
Lorsqu'il a fait couler tes pleurs

Tu m'avais dit avant d'partir
Surtout ne m'oublie pas trop vite
J'tai vu t'éloigner sans rien dire
Comme un bêtise qu'on prémédite

Il y a encore le téléphone
Où quelquefois je peux appeler
Mais ta voix dans le microphone
Est juste là pour m'faire pleurer

Avec qui tu vis avec qui tu dors
Est-il aussi gentil que moi
Quand avec lui du corps à corps
Fais-tu l'amour à haute voix

Est-ce qu'il t'écris de belles chansons
Avec un morceau de son cœur
Comme moi est-ce qu'il demande pardon
Lorsqu'il a fait couler tes pleurs

Je tourne en rond j'ai mal partout
J'entends tes pas dans l'escalier
C'est seulement le voisin du d'sous
Il faut que j'arrête d'y penser

Il y a toujours les mêmes images
De tes velours sur ce grand lit
Tous ces cadeaux comme des mirages
Que tu offres maintenant à lui

Avec qui tu vis avec qui tu dors
Est-il aussi gentil que moi
Quand avec lui du corps à corps
Fais-tu l'amour à haute voix

Est-ce qu'il t'écris de belles chansons
Avec un morceau de son cœur
Comme moi est-ce qu'il demande pardon

Avec qui tu vis avec qui tu dors
Est-il aussi gentil que moi

Ton ventre était bien rond
C'est vrai qu'on l'attendait
On voulait l'appeler Jason

Ce matin là, il faisait froid
J'avais rendez-vous au studio
Et tout en soufflant sur mes doigts
J'disais l'petit sera un verseau

Avoir un seul enfant de toi
Ça faisait longtemps que j'attendais
Le voir grandir auprès de toi
C'est le cadeau dont je rêvais
Qu'il ait ton sourire, ton regard
Quand tu te lèves le matin
Avec l'amour et tout l'espoir
Que j'ai quand tu me tiens la main

Et puis on m'a téléphoné
Et moi bien sûr, j'ai tout quitté
Les chœurs, les cuivres et la rythmique
J'devenais papa, c'était magique

Puis le taxi m'a déposé
Devant la porte de la clinique
Et comme un fou je suis monté
Garçon ou fille c'était critique

Avoir un seul enfant de toi
Ça faisait longtemps que j'attendais
Le voir grandir auprès de toi

Qu'il ait ton sourire, ton regard
Quand tu te lèves le matin
Avec l'amour et tout l'espoir
Que j'ai quand tu me tiens la main

On m'a tendu un paquet d'langes
Dans lequel petit homme dormait
Puis on m'a dit, d'une voix étrange
Que c'était tout ce qui m' restait

Tout le monde était très gentil
Et moi je ne comprenais pas
Que dans son cœur y' avait la vie
Et qu' dans le tien, il faisait froid

Ça fait dix ans qu' t'as fais le vide
Dix ans qu'tu n'es plus là
C'est le p'tit homme qui compte mes rides
Il dit qu'il t'aime à travers moi

Ton image est bien trop vivace
Et c'est bien celle que j'aime le mieux

Toutes ces images ces photos
Me font encore pleurer sur ta peau

Qu'est ce tu crois
Qu' j'ai pu t'oublier un jour
Entre Manille et Cherbourg

J' t'ai dans la tête tatouée comme la folie
Mais côté coeur j'ai toujours été fantaisie

Et le souvenir que j'ai de toi
C'est d' l' amour fou qui bat, qui bat
Comme la musique de Carlos Mandelli

Et le souvenir que j'ai de toi
C'est d' l'amour fou tu l' croirais pas
C'est romantique comme Bahia sous la pluie

J' prends l' bateau dans deux heures
Madagascar en skipper
Il m' faudrait plusieurs tours du monde
Pour qu' j'oublie

Que j' me r' gardais dans tes yeux
Que j' dormais dans tes cheveux
Drôle de jeu, drôle de vie

J' t'ai dans la tête comme
Une folle symphonie
Mais dans ma tête
J'y pense et puis jamais j'oublie

It's terribly sad but true,

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Phil Carmen,"Far between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
An' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsakened
Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
An' the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

In the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
All down in taken-for-granted situations
Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute
For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chaineded an' cheated by pursuit
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing",Chimes of Freedom

For the words to say how I feel.
I'd spend my time thinking too much
And leave too little to say what I mean
I've tried to understand the best I can
All of my life.

All of my life, I've been saying sorry
For the things I know I should have done
All the things I could have said come back to me
Sometimes I wish that it had just begun
Seems I'm always that little too late
All of my life

Set 'em up, I'll take a drink with you
Pull up a chair, I think I'll stay
Set 'em up, 'cause I'm going nowhere
There's too much I need to remember, too much I need to say

All of my life, I've been looking 
But it's hard to find the way
Reaching past the goal in front of me
While what's important just slips away
It doesn't come back but I'll be looking
All of my life

Set 'em up

All of my life, there have been regrets
That I didn't do all I could
Making records upstairs, while he watched TV

Phil Collins,"Deep inside the border
Children are crying
Fighting for food
Holding their heads
Breaking their bread with a stone

All along the roadside
People are standing 
Watching the sun
Shielding their eyes
Brushing the flies from their face

Tell me, what can you say
Tell me, who do you blame
Like a mirror you see yourself
These people each have a name

All around the township
Young men are dying
(of) hunger and thirst
The well has run dry
The tears from her eye feeds her son

Tell me

You can say you're pulling back
We see the pictures everywhere
But what we don't see is what's
Going on behind the closed doors
And you don't seem to care

Do you expect me to believe you
How can you really think
You can take your horse down to the water
Hold a gun at his head
And make him drink

No matter what you say, it never gets any better
No matter what you do, we never see any change

People living without rights
Without their dignity
How loud does one man have to shout 
To earn his right to be free

You can keep your toy soldiers
To segregate the black and white
But when the dust settles
And the blood stops running
How do you sleep at night?

No matter what you say

What makes you so high and mighty
What makes you so qualified
You can sit there and say
How many have their freedom 
But how many more have died

You decide to sit in judgment
Trying to play God yourself
Someday soon the buck is gonna stop
Stop with you and no one else

No matter",Colours

Cause all the things you thought were safe, now they're gone
But you won't be alone, I'll be here to carry you along
Watching you 'til all your work is done

When you find your heart, you'd better run with it

Don't look back
She may soon be gone, no don't look back
She's not the only one, remember that

If your heart is beating fast, then you know she's right
If you don't know what to say, well, that's all right
You don't know what to do?
Remember she is just as scared as you

Don't be shy, even when it hurts to say
Remember, you're gonna get hurt someday, anyway

Survivors in the night   

When all is said and done
We'll find someday
We can forget all this
Somehow, some way

And as long as I'm here
There'll be no worries any more
And all these promises I'm making now
I'll hold each day

Phil Collins,"'There's a place for us, somewhere a time and a place.' 

So here we are together
Just you and me
Sitting side by side
Don't know why
With time just racing by
But I don't want to go

Well I don't know much about it
Cause all I am is what you see
In front of you
There's no more
Feels so close and yet so far
But I don't want to go

Here I am, take my hand
Here I am, please take my hand

I'd like to sit here with you if that's alright
If you don't mind I could sit and stare all night
Sit here waiting for you to hold me tight

It's sad but I know it's true
You see I know you well
You'd only laugh at me
And that would hurt me so
Just look at me here
You've got me pleading with you
But I don't want to go

Cause you know that I love you so
Yes you know that I love you so

Here. I will be here love
For you love, I will always be here love

If you look real close
You'll see my heart is on my sleeve
And it'll be here waiting
Waiting for you, waiting for me
Someone once said that if you truly, truly believe
You can make things happen
Make things appear to be all that they seem
Tell me do you believe?

We'll find a hideaway
Together we'll find a way
Somewhere, somehow, we'll find some way
There must be somewhere
There must be someplace
We can find somewhere
Where they don't know my face
Believe me we can find it
Yes we can find it

My harbor lights are fading fast
Soon they'll disappear
Alone I sit in darkness
Hoping someone might come near
Though I wait, though I try
No one ever comes
And the feeling that I have flood over me
The river starts to run

We fly so close
We fly so close
Sometimes we fly too close

Every place you run to, everywhere you turn
There are places that you know you should not go
But some bridges just won't burn
All my life, though I try
I cannot change the past
And the ghosts that come back to haunt you
Make you realize at last

We fly so close
We fly so close
Sometimes we fly too close
We fly too close

My heart is racing much faster now
Life passes before my eyes
Something's I see, they make me smile
Something's they make me cry
So I look, so I try to find
A lesson I can learn
The passing of time hasn't changed my mind
And the ghosts I know return

You know we fly so close
We fly so close
Sometimes we fly too close
We fly too close

We fly so close, you and I sometimes
Sometimes we fly so close,
We'll never know how many times
We fly so close
We fly so close",We Fly So Close

Live daily under the cloud of terrorism. 
That familiarity sometimes makes you think of it as almost normal

We stand, hang our heads disbelieving 
Then not knowing how could such a thing be wrong 
We wonder just what they must be thinking 
To take a life of one so young 

So tell me when will it be over now, how soon? 
How far must we go, to prove to you? 

We wait and we wonder how this happened 
Killing the old, the innocent, the young 
While sons follow in fathers footsteps not understanding 
That what they do could somehow be so wrong 

So tell me when will it be over now, how soon? 
How far must we go, to prove to you? 

So we will wait and we'll wonder 

No regrets, no forgiveness, no compassion 
These brave heroes only know to hit and run 
Slowly my sadness turns to rage and we wonder 
How can these scars ever heal, when all is said and done 

So tell me when will it be over now, how soon? 
How many tears must fall to prove to you?

I hope I can make him so proud of me
Proud enough to call me his son

What makes these people so different now
What makes these times so strange?
Seems most people got most everything they need
How come we see this change

Our sons and daughters seem to be beyond our control
Their smile is fading fast, they're losing their soul
When will we ever learn, yet I'm a believer

When I was a boy, did we have more respect?
This world seemed a nicer place to be
But time slowly passes and one day you look around
You hardly recognize what you see

Our sons and daughters seem to be beyond our control
Their smile is fading fast, they're losing their soul
Now when will we ever learn, yet I'm a believer

They're beyond our control

We're all sons of our fathers
Sometimes I feel like mine
And I can hear him say, the things I say
Seems all things come around in time

Why these things happen we'll never know
Guess that was then and this is now
We always knew that change was gonna come
But I want to go back, please tell me how

I had gone to see the park where my papa used to play,
It's called called Villa Borghese and it's on the way
To East Africa.

Down on Grand Comoro Island, where I grew past four,
I could swim and fish and snorkel on the ocean floor,
And the wind laughed, and the wind laughed through the trees as if to say,
Here's a child who'll want the world to go his way
In East Africa, in East Africa.

Suddenly for me the world turned upside down 
Far from my friends the lions and the dolphins came this awful sound.

Dark shadows, sounds of thunder raging over me,
Came this monster called 'A-dre-no-leu-ko-dys-tro-phy'
Where's my East Africa?

Well they said, they said, they said (the ones who know it all)
They said from now on for you there will be no more standing tall,
So I took my parents' hands, I lifted my head to say
I'll just have to be a hero, there's no other way!

Phil Collins,"Find yourself in the gutter in a lonely part of town 
Where death waits in the darkness with a weapon to cut some stranger down 
Sleeping with an empty bottle, he's a sad and an empty hearted man 
All he needs is a job, and a little respect, so he can get out while he can 

We always need to hear both sides of the story 
Both sides of the story 

A neighborhood peace is shattered it's the middle of the night 
Young faces hide in the shadows 
While they watch their mother and father fight 
He says she's been unfaithful, she says her love for him has gone 
And the brother shrugs to his sister and says 
Looks like it's just us from now on' 

We always need to hear both sides of the story 
We need to hear both sides of the story 

And the lights are all on, the world is watching now 
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now 
Be sure, before we close our eyes 
Don't walk away from here 
'Til you hear both sides, no no no 

Here we are all gathered in what seems to be the centre of the storm 
Neighbours once friendly now stand each side of the line that has been drawn 
They've been fighting here for years, but now there's killing on the streets 
While small coffins are lined up sadly, now united in defeat 

Oh, we always need to hear both sides of the story 

When the lights are all on, the world is watching now 
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now 
Be sure, before we close our eyes 
Don't walk away from here 
'Til you see both sides, no no no no 

White man turns the corner, finds himself within a different world 
Ghetto kid grabs his shoulder, throws him up against the wall 
He says 'would you respect me if I didn't have this gun 
'Cause without it, I don't get it, and that's why I carry one' 

We always need to hear We always need to hear both sides of the story

A simple life, they live in peace

Raise your head up
Lift high the load
Take strength from those that need you
Build high the walls
Build strong the beams
A new life is waiting
But danger's no stranger here

No words describe a mother's tears
No words can heal a broken heart
A dream is gone, but where there's hope

Somewhere something is calling for you
Two worlds, one family
Trust your heart
Let fate decide
To guide these lives we see",Two Worlds [Phil Version]

I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
Got your ticket
Got your suitcase
Got your leaving smile
I could say that's the way it goes
And I could pretend and you won't know
That I was lying

Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

We took a taxi to the station, not a word was said
And I saw you walk across the road
For maybe the last time, I don't know
Feeling humble
I heard a rumble
On the railway track
And when I hear that whistle blow
I'll walk away and you won't know
That I'll be crying

Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

Even try, I'll always be here by your side
Why, why, why, I never wanted to say goodbye
Why even try, I'll always be here if you
Change, change your mind

So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
But that would be lying

No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I even try?",Can't Stop Loving You

Or what they leave behind

Is calling to him now, 
And though he hears him
He looks out to sea.
Somewhere out there lie his dreams
A story with no ending
And till he finds his answers
He won't be going nowhere

For him, it's not too late
It's not too late
For some it's never too late

Quietly knocking on her door.
He patiently stands waiting, 
And though she hears him
She sits steadfast in her chair.
Somewhere out there never seen
Her hopes and dreams lie waiting, 
And till she finds an answer
She won't be going nowhere

For her, it's not too late
It's not too late
For some it's never too late

For everything we know that's certain
There is much we cannot see, 
So we choose to close the curtain, 
Never knowing what could have been

It's not too late, it's not too late, never too late

Slowly rocking the baby's bed
He strokes it's head and whispers
And though it hears him, 
It keeps smiling and kicks it's feet
Somewhere out there is a life, 
A lifetime made for living
So it holds on fast, it ain't going nowhere

Least you can do is say you're sorry
Least you can do is give me back my heart
Just give me back my heart

Seems living in hope was wrong those years I was away
Thinking your letters, I never received, had gone astray
You said you'd always be there for me
Like a fool I thought you'd be
Now I don't know what I was thinking at all

But the least you can do is say you're sorry girl
Least you can do is give me back my heart

The farther we go

Wanting to play the game we've begun
Through all of the high times

The more there will be

Hey Momma!
Is it true what they say that Papa never worked a day, in his life
And Momma, some bad talk goin' round town sayin' that Papa had three outside children
And another wife, and that ain't right
Heard them talking Papa doing some store front preachin'
Talked about saving souls and all the time reaching
Dealing in debt, and stealing in the name of the law
Momma hung her head and said

Hey Momma,
I heard Papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me is that what sent Papa to an early grave
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow, steal
To pay his bills

Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking

Where the sun would keep shining, the day never end

By the shores of the Swilly, now with kids of our own 
Another year over, and see how they've grown 
Then we'd watch the last sunset, and walk arm in arm 
Till I see you next summer; God keep you from harm 
And if I was a flier who crashed now and then, 
She would put me together and fly me again.

And if I was a flier who crashed now and then,

But I feel in that moment, a part of me died...

I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Phil Coulter,"Every time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take

Baby, when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away

I've never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts, I can see your dreams

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better

I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever

Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you

The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark

Your hair all around me
Baby, you surround me
You touch every place in my heart

Oh, it feels like the first time every time
I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you

Phil Coulter,"Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
You been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one but I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet

Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get

Desperado, oh you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom, well that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin' but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
(Let somebody love you)
You better let somebody love you before it's too late
",Desperado
Phil Coulter,"I know they say if you love somebody
You should set them free (so they say)
But it sure is hard to do
Yeah, it sure is hard to do
And I know they say if they don't come back again
Then it's meant to be (so they say)
But those words ain't pulling me through
'cause I'm still in love with you
I spend each day here waiting for a miracle
But it's just you and me going through the mill
(climbin' up a hill) 

[Chorus]
This is the long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breaking a heart?
No matter how hard I try
You're gonna make me cry
Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it
All that's happening here is a long goodbye

Sometimes I ask my heart did we really
Give our love a chance (just one more chance)
And I know without a doubt
I turned it inside out
And if we walked away
Would make more sense (only self defense)
But it tears me up inside
Just to think we still could try
How long must we keep riding on a carousel
Going round and round and never getting anywhere?
(on a wing and prayer)

[Chorus: x2]

The long goodbye
The long goodbye
This is the long goodbye

Someone please tell me why

Are you ever coming back again
Are you ever coming back again
Are you ever coming back again
Guess I'm never coming back again",The Long Goodbye

And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

Who had to fall to rise again?

Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Will never disappear

That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day

And many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal.

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Phil Driscoll,"Should you go first and I remain to walk the road alone
I'll live in memory's garden dear with happy days we've known
In spring I'll wait for roses red, when fades the lilacs bloom
And in early fall when brown leaves fall, I'll catch a glimpse of you

Should you go first and I remain, for battles to be fought
Each thing you've touched along the way, will be a hallowed spot
I'll hear your voice I'll see your smile though blindly I may grope
The memory of your helping hand will buoy me on with hope

Beyond the sunset, oh blissful morning
When with our savior, heaven is begun
Earth's toiling ended, oh glory dawning
Beyond the sunset when day is done

Should you go first and I remain, to finish with the scroll
No lessening shadows shall ever creep in to make this life seem droll
We've known so much of happiness, we've had our cup of joy
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy

I want to know each step you take that I may walk the same
For someday down that lonely road, you'll hear me call your name
Should you go first and I remain, one thing I'll have you do
Walk slowly down that long long path, for soon I'll follow you

In that fair homeland, we'll know no parting
Beyond the sunset for ever more

Too soon, too soon,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here

Over the shadows and the rain

Down at the bottom of the sea.
I met a Mermaid fair, Who had a cottage there,
Her name was Minnie and she tumbled for me.
She had the tail of a fish for a train,
But just the same, she could sure entertain.

Oh what a time I had with Minnie the Mermaid,
Down at the bottom of the sea;
I forgot my troubles, There among the bubbles,
Gee but she was awfully good to me.
And every night when the star fish came out,
I'd hug and kiss her so.

Who joined the Darktown Poker Club
But cursed the day he told them he would join
His money used to go like it had wings
If he yelled queens, someone had kings
And each night he would contribute all his coin
Then he said I'm gonna play 'em tight tonight
He said there'll be no bobtail flushes make me bite
'Cause when I gets in them my hands will be a peach
And he played them tight but lost his pile
And Bill got peevish after a while
So he rose, looked all around, and made this speech

He said you all see this brand new razor
I had it sharpened just today
Now I'm coming in there with my rules
That you must follow when you play
Now keep your big bony hands on the table
While you dealing, please
And don't be slippin' them aces down there
Er, in between your knees
And don't be makin' all them funny signs
Like you tryin' to tip off your hand
Just talk in American, boy, American
So's I can understand
And don't be dealin' off the bottom
Because ooh that's rough
Take five, five, then stop, that's enough
Now when you bet put up the chips
Because I don't like it when you shy
Then if you get busted go on out and get some
I'm gonna be here by and by

Everytime before you deals
Then if anything's wrong, I must see
'Cause I mean, you always ain't no, er

Now sittin' right there in that there clan
There chance to be a one-eyed man
And Bill kept watchin' him out the corner of his eye
When ole one-eye would deal and then
Would cost that Bill another five or ten
Bill got up again, looked all around him with a sigh
He said, Lord, this is an awful shame
He said, There someone cheatin' in this 'ere game
He said, it goes, er, 
It ain't no do for me to name the guy
So I'll refrain from mentioning the party's name
If I catch him cheatin' just once again
I'm gonna take my fist and close that other eye

I had it sharpened just today
I'm comin' in there with my own rules
That you must follow when you play
Hey kid, keep your hands up there
While you're givin' them out, please
Stop puttin' them wildies 
Down there 'tween your knees
Stop makin' all them funny signs
Like you're tryin' to tip off your hand
Keep talkin' in American, big AAA
That's what I can understand
And don't be getting' them off the bottom
Because I keep tryin' to tell you it's rough
This an army game, five, five, halt, that's enough
Now when you bet let me see the reds and blues
'Cause I don't like it when you shy
Then if you run out of gas, go get pumped up
I'm gonna be here by and by

Pass them pasteboards for me to shuffle 
Every time before you deal, let me ripple

I mean, you always ain't gonna keep playin' the game now

I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Has anybody seen my girl?
Turned up nose, turned down hose
Never had no other beaus
Has anybody seen my girl?
Now if you run into a 
Five foot two, covered with fur
Diamond rings and all those things
Betcha' life it isn't here
But could she love, could she woo?
Could she, could she, could she coo?

Phil Harris,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

Phil Haynes,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne

A tear was in her eye

Phil Hilborne,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

I was made a newborn man.
What I had gained I left behind
It's drifting further back in time, bye bye.
You took my hand and led me 
Out of darkness, oh yes.

Full circle, I have come,
You can ask me where I come from
And when I tell you that it's no lie
I've come full circle in my life.

Phil Keaggy,"Love, you have truly won my heart today,
Love, I am by your side and here I'll stay.
As we leave our lives behind and enter anew
A place where we two can now rise,
Take hold of the morning.

Love and devotion walking hand in hand,
More than emotion this is in His plan.
I'm amazed at how He's placed you in my life.
There was a time when my eyes
Couldn't face the morning.

Honey, I'm thankful cause you loved me.
Darlin', I'm thankful cause you needed me.
Oh, what a wonder, oh, what a wonder you are,

Now we are under the everlasting arms.

The past behind I know,
Never again, never intend to show.
And I try not to think of things

I look through the window,
And a memory sweeps over me
When you said, I will never let go,
But when you did it hurt me so.

I'll never give up hope, I've just begun.

There are places yet to be discovered.
Stories as of yet untold
Til their faces have become uncovered.

Deep and wide, near and far.
Out beyond the furthest star,

Hidden deep within my heart
There are secrets yet to see the daylight.

Phil Keaggy,"With every halting step I take
I hang by a thread that will not break.
God loves the wayward child
He longs to be reconciled
To those on the other side of grace.

If we all hunger for the truth,
And if we share these common roots.
In Adam we had our start,
And through him we drift apart,
But there can be a change upon the face.

There is a light that shines in darkness,
There is a lamp that lights the way,
May you find comfort in its glow,
May you know all there is to know,
May you find warmth within its rays.

This is a re-occurring dream.
History's re-occurring theme,
Prisoners of human pride,
An unlikely place to hide
Wondering who will light the way.

All the days became so long,
Did you really think I'd do you wrong.
Dixie, when I let you go,
Thought you'd realize that I would know,
That I would show the special love I have for you,
My Baby Blue.

What can I do, what can I say,
Except I want you by my side.
How can I show you, show me a way,
Don't you know the times I've tried.

Guess that's all I have to say,
Except the feeling just grows stronger every day.

Take good care, baby, let me know.

Phil Keaggy,"Dusty roads, calloused feet, 
The sun beats upon their heads.
They feel the pain, they touch the earth, 
Embrace the sick in their beds.

A child lies in agony, 
Her mama's none left to spare,
When open mouths anticipate 
A little bit of milk from anywhere.

And across the landscape will be drawn a painting of true humanity.

Don't pass me by, the night's so long, 
Don't ask me why it all went wrong.

Our human need is crying out 
As greed eats to the marrow.
Do we ignore a suffering world just
To keep to the straight and narrow.

We turn aside to please ourselves,
And won't give the time of day,
To the victims of injustice in a world
When we turn and look and walk the other way.

And justifying ourselves we ask, is this my neighbor?

Don't pass me by, the night's so long,
Don't ask me why it all went wrong.

But I believe that we could change 
At least the world of just one life.

True love has a different face,
No place for condescending pride.
That's how it really ought to be,
Giving ourselves to those in need,
That's how it really ought to be.

Don't ask me why it all went wrong.",Don't Pass Me By

And yes, it's true you feel the same.

Don't let go of my heart,
Don't ever leave me here too long in isolation.
Don't let go of my heart,
I do believe You're here, to offer consolation.

There were signs all along the road 
And throughout my life.
Gentle reminders of the way I should go, 
And You were by my side.
Oh let me see what I long to behold, open my eyes.

Under that cold shoulder there's a heart of gold.

Where there's a rule broken
There's an innocent man who paid the price.

Breaking hearts and jumping fences, it ain't nothing

And beckon your soul afire.
You can't hide He'll work until that seal is broken,
And give you your heart's desire.

With sore abuse and scorn!

What thou, my Lord, has suffered
Was all for sinners' gain;
Mine, mine was the transgression,
But thine the deadly pain.
Lo, here I fall, my Savior!

Look on me with thy favor,
Vouchsafe to me thy grace.

all the color and the light dazzled my eyes.
Love looked so promising from far away.
A world of hopes and possibilities of what life could be,
and every night and day I'd dream
of all I'd have in my museum.

Through landscapes blue and gold,
in the shadows and sunlight I searched for truth,
but my elusive muse seemed lost at sea.
And all I found were statues made of stone, lifelike, but so cold.
Their jaded hearts and marble souls
left empty halls in my museum. 

But still I wished for one work of art
I could treasure and hold.
Monet in spring, in twilight's dim
I'd dance for my Degas, could be Caravaggio,
or my Picasso. 

At last it's come to light. 
Now this rare and priceless gem defines my life,
and every corridor leads to this room.

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Phil Klein,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You

We've danced the whole night through
And daylight soon will be dawning

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

By the name of Nostradamus
Who prophesied that in the late twentieth century

Do you believe this to be true

The night that my father died
He was crying out in pain
To his God he said, have mercy, mercy

Unknown to man so he expected no cure
But before he died that night
He was lost, insane

Phil Lynott,"I am just a cowboy, lonesome in the trail.
Starry night, campfire light, and the coyote calls where the howlin' winds will.
So I ride out to the ol' sundown. I am just a cowboy, lonesome on the trail.
Lord I'm just thinking about a certain female.
And the nights we spent together, riding on the range.
Looking back, it doesn't seem so strange.

Roll me over and turn me around. Let me keep spinning 'til I hit the ground.
Roll me over and let me go, riding in the rodeo.

I was took in Texas, I did not know her name.
But Lord all these southern girls, they seem the same.
But down below the border, in a town in Mexico,
I got my job busting broncs for the rodeo.

Roll me over ans turn me around, let me keep spinnin till I hit the ground.
Roll me over and let me go, running free with the buffalo.

Roll me over, and I'll turn around.
And I'll move my fingers up and down.
Up and down.

It's ok amigo, just let me go.
Riding in the rodeo.

Roll me over and turn me around, let me keep spinning till I hit the ground.
Roll me over and let me go, riding in the rodeo.
Roll me over and set me free, the cowboy's life is the life for me.",Cowboy Song
Phil Lynott,"When I passed you in the doorway
You took me with a glance
I should have took that last bus home
But I asked you for a dance

Now we go steady to the pictures
I always get chocolate stains on my pants
My father he's going crazy
Say's I'm living in a trance

But I'm dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
It's alright, alright
Dancing in the moonlight
On the long hot summer night
 
 It's three o'clock in the morning
And I'm on the streets again
I disobeyed another warning
I should have been in by ten

Now I won't get out until Sunday
I'll have to say I stayed with friends
But it's a habit worth forming
If it means to justify the end

Phil Lynott,"There are people that will investigate you
They'll insinuate, intimidate and complicate you
Don't ever wait or hesitate to state the fate that awaits those who
Try to shake or take you

It's not wrong what I sing it's true

They'll scandalize and tell lies until they realize
You are someone they should have apologized to
Don't let these people compromise you

It's not wrong what I sing it's true

Not a word of this is true
Don't believe me if I tell you
Especially if I tell you that I'm in love with you

Don't believe me if I tell you
That I wrote this song for you
There might be some other silly pretty girl
I'm singing it to

Don't believe a word
For words are only spoken
Your heart is like a promise
Made to be broken

Don't believe a word
Words can tell lies
And lies are no comfort

Phil Lynott,"Down from the glen came the marching men
With their shields and their swords
To fight the fight they believed to be right
Overthrow the overlords

To the town where there was plenty
They brought plunder, swords and flame
When they left the town was empty
Children would never play again

From their graves I heard the fallen
Above the battle cry
By that bridge near the border
There were many more to die

Then onward over the mountain
And outward towards the sea
They had come to claim the emerald
Without it they could not leave",Emerald

Standing in the corner giving him a thrill

Alright in the middle of the night

In the doorway up against the wall
When they play a heavy record then I'm gonna have a ball

Stop this cheating
Stop treating me like I am some

You're not so cool
Remember it's to me you are speaking
Stop cutting

Stop hurting
Stop this dirt
About you lifting up your skirt
To any man dressed in pants with shirt buttons undone and flirting

When you are so low down in Soho
There is no hope no how
No place to go
You will go along

Some people say I'm a crazy kind of fool
But be that as it may
You always treat me cruel

Stop talking
Stop eating
We can't go on meeting
And greeting

Meeting and cheating and meeting
And sleeping you know that's deceiting
And that's only repeating

There is no hope no how
There is no place to go

But decideds to leave the questions utill later on

From the corner of his mouth
He's late, he's missed that train again

All his fears deliverd with one blow

Or some preminition like we were told 
It was no figment of the imagination 
To prove that we could be bought or sold 
The doctor of the diamond run 
Could be revealed to the intellegent 
But this is what I resent Who cares for the ignorant, the 
intellegent The 
cynics approach was mean 
Who cares for anything in this whole wide world except me 
And this opinion must not confuse the issue 
My appearence, my condition, Or state of delivery 
I am stating the obvious 
This is a protest 
There must me a collusion 
This is no Shakespearean speach 
This is a statement 
Made by one who can not practice what he preaches 
The statue of liberty 
Has engraved on it's wall 
Give me your poor, give me your needy Give me them all 
We need something like this 
For this world to coexist 
It would be so easy To act so pretensious 
To act as if it was hypocracy 
To act condisending 
When in fact it's the world we're mending 
And that's why I can't relax 
Cause inside my coat it's a pistol that I pack 
We must beware of a suprise nuclear attack 
We must be ready to strike back 
I'm not pretending 
Our defense needs clearly mending 
We must leave those standing 
Forget the third world is ending 
Is starving, 
Is crying 
Is desolate, 
Is oh so late 
I would dearly love to return 
Through a mirror in twenty years 
And learn 
what the future has in store for us 
And if I learned that we lost 
And there was no hope 
For those that fight 
I would turn to drink 
And drink is drugs 
And drugs would help me sink 
And like of boat, I float 
I sail out to the sky 
To the universe and back 
Maybe to give it another try 
I don't know why, why Jack

Just to learn, just to heal us ",Ode to Liberty - Protest Song

Phil Manzanera,"Baby's on fire
Better throw her in the water
Look at her laughing
Like a heifer to the slaughter

Baby's on fire
And all the laughing boys are bitching
Waiting for photos
Oh the plot is so bewitching

Rescuers row row
Do your best to change the subject
Blow the wind blow blow
Lend some assistance to the object

Photographers snip snap
Take your time she's only burning
This kind of experience
Is necessary for her learning

If you'll be my flotsam
I could be half the man I used to
They said you were hot stuff
And that's what baby's been reduced to

Juanita and Juan
Very clever with maracas
Making their fortunes
Selling secondhand tobaccoes

Juan dances at Chico's
And when the clients are evicted
He empties the ashtrays
And pockets all that he's collected

But baby's on fire
And all the instruments agree that
Her temperature's rising
But any idiot would know that
",Baby's on Fire
Phil Manzanera,"Along the wing you see the searchlight beam
Down below, traced freeway stream
A field of precious stones illuminates the night
Heading for touchdown, looking for runway light

From in the sky the city's at its best
Down the hills to its ocean's rest
And as you watch the lightscape sit back, relax and dream
This is the future, this is tomorrow's scheme

We're coming in, the runway flashes past
This is it, now we're here at last
We've tried to make this crossing so many times before
See that people walking through heaven's door

We're finally here, it looks just fine
Let's stroll the streets, sidewalk sign
Stand and wait and watch the cars
As they smoke on, go by so fast
They look just fine, we'll cross at last
The headlights flicker in our faces

Try to eat some fetid meat
Yours tastes just fine, same as mine
If you can pay, it happens here
Do what you say, will be tonight's career
While guarantee hot company
The red light flickers in their faces

Roll up your sleeve, pass it round
It's what you seek, dope in town
Feels just fine to be with you
Your place or mine, I'll show you what to do
And in the nights, you'll come on through
Walking through heaven's door

Walking through heaven's door
Walking through heaven's door
Walking through heaven's door
Walking through heaven's door

Walking through heaven's door
Walking through heaven's door
Walking through heaven's door
Walking through heaven's door

Walking through heaven's door
Walking through heaven's door
Walking through heaven's door
Walking through heaven's door

Walking through heaven's door
Walking through heaven's door
Walking through heaven's door
Walking through heaven's door

Walking through heaven's door
Walking through heaven's door
Walking through heaven's door
Walking through heaven's door
Walking through heaven's door

This is our dream
Fulfilled at last
Grace with thee
Forget the past

Phil Manzanera,"All the peasants in the squares
At their tables and their chairs
Set to salvage certain numbers
From the wonder of the Tundra
And the muses in the gloom
Counting needles in their rooms
On the carpet in the corner
In a kind of secret slumber
While the in formation rain
Slashed the dirty windowpane to the square

Smoky broads and smoky windows in the square
Come come charmer come on over for the day
Disappearing cocoa forests flash and die
Fortunes crumble all demolished in the bay

Over forty pointed people
In the perfect pointed steeple
Looked to see the lucky number
Yes the wonder of the Tundra
Had come up to fame and fortune
Singing his tune, my tune, your tune
Wooing daughters of the gifted
On the carpets of the courtrooms
While the tickets were expensive
The show was quite relentless in the square

Dalai Llama lame puss puss
Stella maris missa nobis
Miss a dinner Miss Shapiro
Shampoos pot-pot pinkies pampered
Movement hampered like at Christmas

Round in circles like the Archers
Always stiff or always starchy
Yes it's happening and it's fattening
And it's all that we can get into the show",Miss Shapiro

Through the mirror and see? 

From Arizona 
To Eldorado 
Sure is a mighty long way.

Is something wrong? 
I know it's hard 
For you to get along 

The bell-tower rings 
It tolls a hollow sound 
But your castles in Spain 
Still maybe realized 
And longings more profound.

Has a silver lining

That comes leaves all you need
And more besides

I am for a life and time by numbers

You never know

I am into friendship and plain sailing
Through frenzied ports a call
Oh, shake the hand to beat the band
With love is all

Or nothing to the man who wants tomorrow
There's one in every town
A crazy guy, he'd rather die
Than be tied down

I am for the man who drives the hammer
To rock you till the grave
His power drill shocks
A million miles away

I am for the revolution's coming
I don't know where she's been
For those who dare because it's there
I know I've seen

Now and then I've suffered imperfection
I've studied marble flaws
And faces drawn pale and worn
By many tears

I am that I am from out of nowhere
To fight without a cause

You seemed so sad
I could see

Through your twisted smile
So unsure
Always confused
Pale blue eyes
Gazing down
From your ivory tower
Through the haze

All broken and bruised
Then: out of the blue
Love came rushing in
Out of the sky
Came the sun
Out of left field
Came a lucky day
Out of the blue

I'm so lost in love, over you.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

He'd been there many times before, but now the law does say
The only way to Cuba is with the CIA

Went down to Cuba, he's not American anymore
But somehow it is strange to hear the State Department say
You are living in the free world, in the free world you must stay
Five thousand dollars or a five year sentence may well be
For a man who had the nerve to think that travelin' is free
Oh why'd he waste his time to see a dictator's reign
When he could have seen democracy by travelin' on to Spain?

Yes, and travel all around the world, see every country through
I'd surely like to come along and see what may be new
But my passport's disappearing as I sing these words to you
Well, there really is no need to travel to these evil lands
Yes, and though the list grows larger you must try to understand
Try hard not to be surprised if someday you should hear
The whole world is off limits, visit Disneyland this year

Phil Ochs,"The peons of Mexico long have known suffering and pain.
Zapata and Villa have died there, fighting in vain.
Rube'n Jaramillo kept up the tradition, he fought for the land once again.
He lived for the land, and there on the land he was slain.

    A forty-five bullet has ended the life of a man who had lived by the gun,
    but all of the bullets of Mexico cannot undo all the work that he's done.

The greedy capiques* have stolen and plundered the land,
With pistoleros they ruled with a cold iron hand.
The poor campesinos could stand it no longer, resistance was starting to grow.
Jaramillo decided to fight for a new Mexico.

    A forty-five bullet has ended the life of a man who had lived by the gun,
    but all of the bullets of Mexico cannot undo all the work that he's done.
    
For twenty long years he fought and he struggled and tried,
Epifania, his wife, always there at his side.
Often surrounded, he always was hounded, they searched for him    
                     near, far, and wide:
A man of deep sorrow, but also a man of deep pride.

    A forty-five bullet has ended the life of a man who had lived by the gun,
    but all of the bullets of Mexico cannot undo all the work that he's done.

Two thousand peasants he led to their long-promised land,
and the army's revenge killed the wife and the sons and the man.
His assasins rejoiced with their whiskey and women, they laughed and 
                     they danced on his grave.
Now the land waits again for another to ride on the waves.

When a kiss from a prison cell is carried in the breeze

That's when I wonder how sad a man can be.

Oh, when will Celia come to me?

I still remember the mountains of the war
Sierra Madre and the Philipino shore
When will I lie beside my Celia 'neath the trees?
Oh, when will Celia come to me?

So many years were stolen, so many years are gone
And the vision of my Celia make dreams to dream upon
Each hour is a day filled with memories.
Oh, when will Celia come to me?

I wake each morning and I watch the sun arise
Wonder if my Celia sleeps, wonder if she cries
If hate must be my prison lock, love must be the key
Oh, when will Celia come to me?

The guns have stopped their firing, you may wander through the hills
They kept my Celia through the war, they keep her from me still.
She waits upon island now, a prisoner of the sea.
Oh, when will Celia come to me?

When the wind from the island is rolling through the trees
When a kiss from a prison cell is carried in the breeze
That's when I wonder how sad a man can be.
Oh, when will Celia come to me?

Phil Ochs,"Well, it's of a bold reporter whose story I will tell
He went down to the Cuban land, the nearest place to hell
He'd been there many times before, but now the law does say
The only way to Cuba is with the CIA

William Worthy isn't worthy to enter our door
Went down to Cuba, he's not American anymore
But somehow it is strange to hear the State Department say
You are living in the free world, in the free world you must stay

Five thousand dollars or a five year sentence may well be
For a man who had the nerve to think that travelin' is free
Oh why'd he waste his time to see a dictator's reign
When he could have seen democracy by travelin' on to Spain?

William Worthy isn't worthy to enter our door
Went down to Cuba, he's not American anymore
But somehow it is strange to hear the State Department say
You are living in the free world, in the free world you must stay

So, come all you good travelers and fellow-travelers, too
Yes, and travel all around the world, see every country through
I'd surely like to come along and see what may be new
But my passport's disappearing as I sing these words to you

Well, there really is no need to travel to these evil lands
Yes, and though the list grows larger you must try to understand
Try hard not to be surprised if someday you should hear
The whole world is off limits, visit Disneyland this year

William Worthy isn't worthy to enter our door
Went down to Cuba, he's not American anymore

",Knock on the Door
Phil Ochs,"On the streets of New York city when the hour was getting 
There were young men armed with knives and guns, young men armed with hateAnd Lou Marsh stepped between them and died there in his tracks                  
For one man is no army when the city turns its back	Now the streets are empty, now the streets are dark
So keep an eye on shadows and never pass the park
For the city is a jungle when the law is out of sight 
And death lurks in El Barrio with the orphans of the night

He left behind a chamber of a church he served so long
For he learned the prayers of distant men will never right the wrongs
His church became an alley and his pulpit was the street
He made his congregation from the boys he used to meet

There were two gangs approaching in spanish Harlem town
The smell of blood was in the air, the challenge was laid down
He felt their blinding hatred, and he tried to save their lives
And the answer that they gave him was their fists and feet and knives

Will Lou Marsh lie forgotten in his cold and silent grave?
Will his memory still linger on, in those he tried to save?
All of us who knew him will now and then recall
And shed a tear on poverty, tombstone of us all",Lou Marsh
Phil Ochs,"In many a time, in many a land,
With many a gun in many a hand,
They came by the night, they came by the day,
Came with their guns to take us away

With a knock on the door, knock on the door.
Here they come to take one more,
One more.

Back in the days of the Roman Empire,
They died by the cross and they died by the fire.
In the stone coliseum, the crowd gave a roar,
And it all began with that knock on the door

Just a knock on the door, knock on the door.
Here they come to take one more,
One more.

The years have all passed, we've reached modern times,
The Nazis have come with their Nazi war crimes.
Yes the power was there, the power was found,
Six million people have heard that same sound

That old knock on the door, knock on the door.
Here they come to take one more,
One more.

Now there's many new words and many new names,
The banners have changed but the knock is the same.
On the Soviet shores with right on their side,
I wonder who knows how many have died

With their knock on the door, knock on the door.
Here they come to take one more,
One more.

Look over the oceans, look over the lands,
Look over the leaders with the blood on their hands.
And open your eyes and see what they do,
When they knock over their friend they're knocking for you

With their knock on the door, knock on the door.
Here they come to take one more,
With their knock on the door, knock on the door.
Here they come to take one more,
One more.

Well, training is the word we use
Nice word to have in case we lose
Training a million Vietnamese
To fight for the wrong government and the American way

Well, they put me in a barracks house
Just across the way from Laos
They said, ""you're pretty safe when the troops deploy
But don't turn your back on your house boy
When they ring the gong, watch out for the Viet-Cong.""

Well, the sergeant said it's time to train
So I climbed aboard my helicopter plane
We flew above the battle ground
A sniper tried to shoot us down
He must have forgotten, we're only trainees
Them Commies never fight fair

Friends, the very next day we trained some more
We burned some villages down to the floor
Yes, we burned out the jungles far and wide
Made sure those red apes had no place left to hide
Threw all the people in relocation camps
Under lock and key, made damn sure they're free

Well, I walked through the jungle and around the bend
Who should I meet but President Diem
Said, you're fighting to keep Vietnam free
For good old de-em-moc-ra-cy (Diem-ocracy)
That means rule by one family
And fifteen thousand American troops, give or take a few

Well, it ain't much but what the heck
It sure beats hell out of Chiang Kai-shek

He said: ""meet my sister, Madam Nhu 
The sweetheart of Dien Bien Phu.""
He said: ""Meet my brothers, meet my aunts
With the government that doesn't take a chance
Families that slay together, stay together.""

Said: ""If you want to stay, you'll have to pay 
Over a million dollars a day

Phil Ochs,"n Portsmouth town on the eastern shore
Where many a fine ship was born.
The Thresher was built
 And the Thresher was launched
And the crew of the Thresher was sworn.
  
She was shaped like a tear
She was built like a shark
She was made to run fast and free.
And the builders shook their hands
And the builders shared their wine,
And thought that they had mastered the sea.
Yes, she'll always run silent
And she'll always run deep
Though the ocean has no pity
   
Though the waves will never weep
They'll never weep.
And they marvelled at her speed
marvelled at her depth
marvelled at her deadly design.
And they sailed to every land
And they sailed to every port
Just to see what faults they could find.
Then they put her on the land
For nine months to stand
And they worked on her from stem to stern.
But they could never see
It was their coffin to be
For the sea was waiting for their return.

Yes, she'll always run silent
And she'll always run deep
Though the ocean has no pity
And the waves will never weep
They'll never weep.

On a cold Wednesday morn
They put her her out to sea
When the waves they were nine feet high.
And they dove beneath the waves
And they dove to their graves
And they never said a last goodbye.
And its deeper and deeper
And deeper they dove
Just to see what their ship could stand.
But the hull gave a moan
And the hull gave a groan
And they plunged to the deepest darkest sand.

Now she lies in the depths
Of the darkened ocean floor
Covered by the waters cold and still.
Oh can't you see the wrong
She was a death ship all along
Died before she had a chance to kill.

And she´ll never run silent,
And she´ll never run deep,
For the ocean had no pity
And the waves, they never weep,
They never weep.

[Alternate final verse from an early Broadside tape]

And it's 8000 fathoms of the water above
And over 100 men below
And sealed in their tomb
Is the cause of their doom
That only the sea will ever know",The Thresher

As we headed for the hills of west virginia

And the red sun of the morning was smiling through the trees,
As the darkness of the night was quickly fading,
And the fog hugged the road like a cloudy, cloudy sea,
As we drove though the hills of west virginia.

We smoked the tobacco and drank of the wine,
And we spoke of the forest we were passing.
And the road would wind and wind and wind,
When we drove through the hills of west virginia.

Among all the wealth of the beauty that we passed,
There was many old shacks a-growing older,
And we saw the broken bottles laying on the grass.
When we drove though the hills of west virginia.

The virginia people watched as we went riding by,
Oh, proud as a boulder they were standing.
And we wondered at each other with a meeting of the eye,
When we drove thought the hills of west virginia.

And once in a while we would stop by the road
And gaze at the womb of the valley,
Almost wishing for a path down below,
Where we stopped in the hills of west virginia.

Up and down and all around we took our restless ride,
And the rocks they were staring cold and jagged.
Where explosions of the powder had torn away the side,
Where we drove through the hills of west virginia.

And the orange sun was falling on the southern border line,
As the shadows of the night were now returning.
And we knew the mountains followed us and watched us from behind,
When we drove from the hills of west virginia.

Phil Ochs,"Have you seen the iron lady's charms
Legs of steel, leather on her arms
Takin' on a man to die
A life for a life, an eye for an eye
And that's the iron lady in the chair

Stop the murder, deter the crimes away
Only killing shows killing doesn't pay
Yes, that's the kind of law it takes
Even though we make mistakes
And sometimes send the wrong man to the chair

In the death row waiting for their turn
No time to change, not a chance to learn
Waiting for someone to call, say it's over after all
They won't have to face the justice of the chair

Just before they serve him one last meal
Shave his head, oh, they ask him how he feels
Then the warden comes to say goodbye
Reporters come to watch him die
Watch him as he's strapped into the chair

And the chaplain, he reads the final prayer
Be brave my son, the Lord is waiting there
Oh, murder is so wrong you see
Both the Bible and the courts agree
That the state's allowed to murder in the chair

In the courtroom, watch the balance of the scales
If the price is right, there's time for more appeals
The strings are pulled, the switch is stayed
The finest lawyers fees are paid
And a rich man's never died upon the chair

That was the president and that was the man.

I still can see him smiling there and waving at the crowd
As he drove through the music of the band
And never even knowing no more time would be allowed
Not for the president and not for the man.

Here's a memory to share, here's a memory to save
Of the sudden early ending of command
Yet a part of you and a part of me is buried in his grave

There are greater things I'll never understand
How a man so filled with life, even death was caught off guard.
That was the president and that was the man.

Was proven by the troubled traitors hand
For what other death could wound the hearts of so many men

Here is an older version of the song, supplied by cody gillespie-lynch

On a south pacific ocean, on a south pacific shore,
A legend was written on the sand,
For a man of peace was born in the middle of a war,
That was the president, and that was the man.

With the wisdom of the old and the vision of the young,
A challenge was given to the land,
And our dreams of peace were spoken with a gifted, golden tongue,
That was the president, and that was the man.

When the freedom revolution gave a rumble and a roar,
The world was shown on which side he would stand,
For the first time in a hundred years he opened up the door,
That was the president, and that was the man.

When a hungry world was searching for a way to feed it's own,
The peace corps was offered as his plan,
And now these seeds of knowledge go wherever winds have blown,
That was the president, and that was the man.

Everything he might've done and all he could've been,
Was proven by the tainted traitor's hand,
For what other death could wound the hearts of so many men,
That was the president, and that was the man.

No end to all the sorrow and the hours we shall grieve,
So deep was the fire of his brand,
And still I can remember, and still I can't believe,
That was the president, and that was the man.

Yes, the glory that was lincoln's never died when he was slain,
That glory shown with roosevelt again,

Phil Ochs,"Joe Hill come over from Sweden shores
Looking for some work to do
And the Statue of Liberty waved him by
As Joe come a sailing through, Joe Hill
As Joe come a sailing through.
Oh his clothes were coarse and his hopes were high
As he headed for the promised land
And it took a few weeks on the out-of-work streets
Before he began to understand
Before he began to understand
And Joe got hired by a bowery bar
sweeping up the saloon
As his rag would sail over the barroom rail
Sounded like he whistled on a tune
You could almost hear him whistling on a tune
And Joe rolled on from job to job
From the docks to the railroad line
And no matter how hungry the hand that wrote
In his letters he was always doing fine
In his letters he was always doing fine
Oh, the years went by like the sun goin' down
slowly turn the page
And when Joe looked back at the sweat upon his tracks
He had nothing to show but his age
He had nothing to show but his age
So he headed out for the California shore
There things were just as bad
So he joined the Industrial Workers of the World
'Cause, The union was the only friend he had
'Cause, The union was the only friend he had
Now the strikes were bloody and the strikes were black
as hard as they were long
In the dark of night Joe would stay awake and write 
In the morning he would raise them with a song
In the morning he would raise them with a song
And he wrote his words to the tunes of the day
To be passed along the union vine
And the strikes were led and the songs were spread
And Joe Hill was always on the line
Yes Joe Hill was always on the line
Now in Salt Lake City a murder was made
There was hardly a clue to find
Oh, the proof was poor, but the sheriff was sure
Joe was the killer of the crime
That Joe was the killer of the crime
Joe raised his hands but they shot him down
he had nothing but guilt to give
It's a doctor I need and they left him to bleed
He made it 'cause he had the will to live
Yes, He made it 'cause he had the will to live
Then the trial was held in a building of wood
And there the killer would be named
And the days weighed more than the cold copper ore
Cause he feared that he was being framed
Cause he found out that he was being framed
Oh, strange are the ways of western law
Strange are the ways of fate
For the government crawled to the mine owner's call
That the judge was appointed by the state
Yes, The judge was appointed by the state
Oh, Utah justice can be had
But not for a union man
And Joe was warned by summer early morn
That there'd be one less singer in the land
There'd be one less singer in the land
Now William Spry was Governor Spry
And a life was his to hold
On the last appeal, fell a governor's tear
May the lord have mercy on your soul
May the lord have mercy on your soul
Even President Wilson held up the day
But even he would fail
For nobody heard the soul searching words
Of the soul in the Salt Lake City jail
Of the soul in the Salt Lake City jail
For 36 years he lived out his days
And he more than played his part
For his songs that he made, he was carefully paid
With a rifle bullet buried in his heart
With a rifle bullet buried in his heart
Yes, they lined Joe Hill up against the wall
Blindfold over his eyes
It's the life of a rebel that he chose to live
It's the death of a rebel that he died
It's the death of a rebel that he died
Now some say Joe was guilty as charged
And some say he wasn't even there
And I guess nobody will ever know
'Cause the court records all disappeared
'Cause the court records all disappeared
Say wherever you go in this fair land
In every union hall
In the dusty dark these words are marked
In between all the cracks upon the wall
In between all the cracks upon the wall

When he knew that his days were through
""Boys, this is my last and final will
Good luck to all of you
Good luck to all of you""",Joe Hill

Never knowing, I was growing, everyday.
My life was once a toy to me,

So I raced through the night
with a face at my feet, like a god I would write,
All the melodies were sweet, and the women were white.
It was easy to survive, my life was so alive.
My life was once a flag to me
And I waved it and behaved like I was told.
My life was once a drag to me
And I loudly, and I proudly, lost control
I was drawn by a dream
I was loved by a lie, every serf on the scene
Begged me to buy.
But I slipped through the scheme
So lucky to fail
My life was not for sale.
My life is now a myth to me
Like the drifter, with his laughter in the dawn.
My life is now a death to me
So I'll mold it and I'll hold it till I'm born
So I turned to the land

When I was a boy in Ohio
It was 3.2 beer at the honky tonk bar
Where they said the girls were easy
But somehow I never found me one

Soon I was grown and I had to leave
And I've been all over the country
But I don't believe I've had more fun

Phil Ochs,"It was on an Indiana farm in the middle of the country
Growin' in the fields of grain, Jim Dean of Indiana
His mother died when he was a boy, his father was a stranger
Marcus Winslow took him in, nobody seemed to want him
The hired man sang like a storm, sometimes he'd beat him
'Cause he would never do the chores, he was lost in dreaming
He never seemed to find a play with the flatlands and the farmers
So he had to leave one day, he said to be an actor
Once he'd come back to the farm with starlets from the stages
They locked themselves inside his room, the people turned their faces
A neighbor ran from the movie house, chickens they were scattered
He swore he saw upon the screen, Jim Dean of Indiana
He played a boy without a home, torn with no tomorrow
Reaching out to touch someone, a stranger in the shadow
The Winslows left for the movie town, they drove across the country
They hoped that he would stay around and they hoped he would be friendly
He talked to them for half an hour but he was busy racing
He left for the Grapevine Road,  they left for Indiana
Then Marcus heard on the radio that a movie star was dying
He turned the tuner way down low, so Ortense could go on sleeping
It was not until they reached the farm where the hired man was waiting
The wind rushed silent through the grain, it was just as they had told him
They buried him just down the road, a mile from the farm house
That is where I placed a flower for Jim Dean of Indiana.",Jim Dean of Indiana

I loved her as the sea sings sadly
Now the ashes of the dream

They told me that the moon was bleeding

Phil Ochs,"I'll sing you a song about a southern town where the devil had his rule
When Marshalls faced an angry mob to send one man to school
His name was Jimmy Meredith
the tide he helped to turn
For he chose to stay on that terrible day
The land was soon to learn
There was blood, red blood, on their hands,
Yellow dirt on their clothes
What they thought they were doing,
Only god and the devil knows
There was hate, cold hate, in their hearts,
Shot from their souls like a gun
And as they threw their stones and bricks,
They screamed, ""see what you have done!""
The governor made a promise he would keep the trouble down
But when the mob got ugly no troopers could be found
And men were filled with hate and fear,
They screamed into the night
The rebel flag waved in the air
The symbol of state's rights
There was blood, red blood, on their hands,
Yellow dirt on their clothes
What they thought they were doing,
Only god and the devil knows
There was hate, cold hate, in their hearts,
Shot from their souls like a gun
And as they threw their stones and bricks,
They screamed, ""see what you have done!""
Gas was fired into the mob after each attack
And though the gas was running low, they never fired back
And when the smoke had cleared and the fury felt its pain
Two men were dead and a hundred bled
The south had risen again
So listen Mr Barnet, and Mr Walker, too
The times are changing mighty fast, they'll roll right over you
But someday you'll head for the south, to the southern tip of hell
And it's hot down there, white-hot down there
Let's hear your rebel yell!
There was blood, red blood, on their hands,
Yellow dirt on their clothes
What they thought they were doing,
Only god and the devil knows
There was hate, cold hate, in their hearts,
Shot from their souls like a gun
And as they threw their stones and bricks,
They screamed, ""see what you have done!""
""See what you have done!""",Ballad of Oxford (Jimmy Meredith)

Living on the lines that were displayed
And now it can be told
I'm a quarter of a century old
But I'm half a century high

In the tube where I was fed
I lost my head
I watch the lives they led
Watch them to the end
And then again
An open kind of laugh
I gave all the mind I had
And whenever I was sad
I had my friends
And now it can be told
I'm a quarter of a century old
But I'm half a century high

In the tube where I was killed
I was fulfilled
Such an easy way to win
Talking to my twin
No sign of sin
the sacrifice was small
fascination was the fall
I was extended by the wall that held me in
And now it can be told
I'm a quarter of a century old
But I'm half a century high

In the tube where I was killed
I was fulfilled
The lies of light would bend
I'd stare until the end
And then again
Faded and the fad
I gave all the mind I had
And whenever I was sad
I had my friends
And now it can be told
I'm a quarter of a century old
But I'm half a century high

In the tube where I was born
I could have sworn
There was so much to see
There was so little to be
But I was free
World at my command
Through the dots I ran
Looking for a man who looked like me
And now it can be told
I'm a quarter of a century old
But I'm half a century high",Half a Century High
Phil Ochs,"Oh I marched to the battle of New Orleans
At the end of the early British war
The young land started growing
The young blood started flowing

But I ain't marchin' anymore
For I've killed my share of Indians
In a thousand different fights
I was there at the Little Big Horn
I heard many men lying
I saw many more dying
But I ain't marchin' anymore

It's always the old to lead us to the war
It's always the young to fall
Now look at all we've won with the saber and the gun
Tell me is it worth it all
For I stole California from the Mexican land
Fought in the bloody Civil War
Yes I even killed my brother
And so many others

And I ain't marchin' anymore
For I marched to the battles of the German trench
In a war that was bound to end all wars
Oh I must have killed a million men
And now they want me back again
But I ain't marchin' anymore

For I flew the final mission in the Japanese sky
Set off the mighty mushroom roar
When I saw the cities burning
I knew that I was learning
That I ain't marchin' anymore

In the year of seventy-four
They crossed the San Juan Mountains
Growing hungry to the core.
Their guide was Alferd Packer
And they trusted him too long:
For his character was weak
And his appetite was strong.

    They called him a murderer, a cannibal, a thief;
    It just doesn't pay to eat anything but Government-inspected beef.

Along the Gunnison River
An Indian camp they spied.
An Indian chief approached them,
To stop them he did try.
He warned them of the danger
In the snow that lay around,
But the danger was in Packer,
For his hunger knew now bound.

    They called him a murderer, a cannibal, a thief;
    It just doesn't pay to eat anything but Government-inspected beef.

Two cold months went slowly by;
Packer came back alone.
""My comrades they all froze to death,
I'm starving,"" he did moan.
The Indian chief knew how he lied,
He spat upon the ground,
For Packer's belly hung out all over his belt:
He'd gained some thirty pounds.

    They called him a murderer, a cannibal, a thief;
    It just doesn't pay to eat anything but Government-inspected beef.

Well for nine long years he ran away
But finally he was tried.
He claimed he didn't kill them,
He only ate their hide.
That County had six dem-o-crats
Until that man arrived.
Well only one lives on today:
He ate the other five.

    They called him a murderer, a cannibal, a thief;
    It just doesn't pay to eat anything but Government-inspected beef.

Eighteen years he stayed in jail,
It was a dreadful fate,
For he suffered indigestion
Every time he ate.
Still, it's hard to blame this hungry guy
Who went searchin' for the mines,
For when he ate his friends
He'd never heard of Duncan Hines.

Well, our standard of living is highest all around,
But our standard of giving is the lowest when you're down,
So give a yell and a whistle when they light that union missile
And we'll lift our feet up off the ground.

Phil Ochs,"Have you seen the rivers of the blood?
First a trickle, then a flood --
First the ocean's pounding roar,
Then a tidal wave hits upon the shore.
Knives and arrows fell like rain,
And the powder burst aflame,
And the flames they flew so high --
Dropped their poison down from the sky.

In the shadow of the bygone days
Millions died in a million ways.
Now the whining of the missile's call:
It's time to rise or it's time to fall,
For now one million bombs are stored,
But they keep building more and more.
Can't you hear the warning sound?
Don't you know there's still time to turn around?

Way high, so high:
Travelin' fast and free.

Tell me what you see.
Can you see the hunger there
Strike without a sound?
Can you see the food you burn
As you circle round?

Way high, so high:
All the world will cheer.

Tell me what you hear.
Can you hear a child cry,
Body filled with pain?
Deadly sores when cures are there--
How much fuel remains?

Way high, so high:
Spaceship made of steel.
Spaceman, look down:
Tell me what you feel.
Can you feel the money gone
As you sail through space?
Can you feel how many die
When you win the race?

They fought the fascist army, they fought the fascist foe?
Do you remember franco, hitler's old ally?
He butchered spain's democracy,half a million free men died.

Ai, ai, ai, ai--
Did you wonder why?
Did you ever pause and cry?

And don't forget the churches and the sad role that they played:
They crucified their people and worked the devil's trade;
But now the wounds are healing with the passing of time,
So we send them planes and rifles and recognize their crime.

Ai, ai, ai, ai--
Did you wonder why?
Did you ever pause and cry?

So spend your tourist dollars and turn your heads away.
Forget about the slaughter, it's the price we all must pay,
For now the world's in struggle, to win we all must bend:
So dim the light in freedom's soul: sleep well tonight, my friend.

Did you ever pause and cry?

That's the way it's gonna be.
     
Wait and see.

Even though you say hard times knock at my door,
Though you say I'll never smile any more--

Then if I try I can climb the highest wall,
It doesn't matter if I slip down and fall:
That's the way it's gonna be.
Wait and see.

Even though you say I've reached the end of my row,
Though you say my times are all running low--

That Old Man Trouble will never get me down.
It's all that easy when you know where you're bound.

Phil Ochs,"Sit by my side, come as close as the air,
Share in a memory of gray;
Wander in my words, dream about the pictures
That I play of changes.

Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall
To brown and to yellow they fade.
And then they have to die, trapped within
the circle time parade of changes.

Scenes of my young years were warm in my mind,
Visions of shadows that shine.
Til one day I returned and found they were the
Victims of the vines of changes.

The world's spinning madly, it drifts in the dark
Swings through a hollow of haze,
A race around the stars, a journey through
The universe ablaze with changes.

Moments of magic will glow in the night
All fears of the forest are gone
But when the morning breaks they're swept away by
golden drops of dawn, of changes.

Passions will part to a strange melody.
As fires will sometimes burn cold.
Like petals in the wind, we're puppets to the silver
strings of souls, of changes.

Your tears will be trembling, now we're somewhere else,
One last cup of wine we will pour
And I'll kiss you one more time, and leave you on
the rolling river shores of changes.

For Underheath her borders, the devil draws no lines,
If you drag her muddy river, nameless bodies you will find.

the calender is lyin' when it reads the present time.
Whoa here's to the land you've torn out the heart of,
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of!

And here's to the people of Mississippi
Who say the folks up north, they just don't understand
And they tremble in their shadows at the thunder of the Klan
The sweating of their souls can't wash the blood from off their hands
They smile and shrug their shoulders at the murder of a man
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of

And here's to the schools of Mississippi
Where they're teaching all the children that they don't have to care
All the rudiments of hatred are present everywhere
And every single classroom is a factory of despair
There's nobody learning such a foreign word as fair
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of

And here's to the cops of Mississippi
They're chewing their tobacco as they lock the prison door
Their bellies bounce inside them when they knock you to the floor
No they don't like taking prisoners in their private little war
Behind their broken badges there are murderers and more
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of

And, here's to the judges of Mississippi
Who wear the robe of honor as they crawl into the court
They're guarding all the bastions of their phony legal fort

When the black man stands accused the trial is always short
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of

And here's to the government of Mississippi
In the swamp of their bureaucracy they're always bogging down
And criminals are posing as the mayors of the towns
And they hope that no one sees the sights and no one hears the sounds
And the speeches of the governor are the ravings of a clown
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of

And here's to the laws of Mississippi
Congressmen will gather in a circus of delay
While the Constitution is drowning in an ocean of decay
Unwed mothers should be sterilized, I've even heard them say
Yes, corruption can be classic in the Mississippi way
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of

And here's to the churches of Mississippi
Where the cross, once made of silver, now is caked with rust
And the Sunday morning sermons pander to their lust
The fallen face of Jesus is choking in the dust
Heaven only knows in which God they can trust

Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of

Phil Ochs,"The wind was a torrent of darkness
Among the gusty trees
The moon was a ghostly galleon
Tossed upon cloudy seas
And the road was a ribbon of moonlight
Over the purple moor
And the highwayman came riding, riding, riding
Yes, the highwayman came riding
Up to the old inn door
Over the cobbles he clattered
And clashed in the darkened yard
And he tapped with his whip at the window
But all was locked and barred
So he whistled a tune to the window
And who should be waiting there
But the landlord's black eyed daughter
Bess the landlord's daughter
Plaiting a dark red love knot
Into her long black hair
One kiss, my bonny sweetheart
For I'm after a prize tonight
But I shall be back with the yellow gold
Before the morning light
Yet if they press me sharply
Harry me through the day
Oh, then look for me by moonlight
Watch for me by moonlight
And I'll come to thee by moonlight
Though Hell should bar the way
He did not come at the dawning
No, he did not come at the noon
And out of the tawny sunset
before the rise of the moon
When the road was a gypsy's ribbon
Looping the purple moor
Oh a redcoat troop came marching, marching, marching
King George's men came marching
Up to the old inn door
And they bound the landlord's daughter
with many a sniggering jest
And they bound the musket beside her
With the barrel beneath her breast
Now keep good watch and they kissed her
She heard the dead man say
""Oh look for me by moonlight
Watch for me by moonlight
And I'll come to thee by moonlight
Though Hell should bar the way""
Look for me by moonlight
Hoof beats ringing clear
Watch for me by moonlight
Were they deaf that they did not hear
For he rode on the gypsy highway
She breathed one final breath
Then her finger moved in the moonlight
Her musket shattered the moonlight
And it shattered her breast in the moonlight
And warned him with her death
Oh he turned; he spurred on to the west
He did not know who stood
Out with her black hair a flowing down
Drenched with her own red blood
Oh not 'til the dawn had he heard it
And his face grew gray to hear
How Bess the landlord's daughter
The landlord's black eyed daughter
Had watched for her love in the moonlight
And died in the darkness there
Back he spurred like a madman
Shrieking a curse to the sky
With the white road smoking behind him
And his rapier brandished high
Blood red were his spurs in the golden noon
Wine red his velvet coat
When they shot him down on the highway
Down like a dog on the highway
And he lay in his blood on the highway
With a bunch of lace at his throat
And still on a winter's night they say
When the wind is in the trees
When the moon is a ghostly galleon
Tossed upon cloudy seas
When the road is a ribbon of moonlight
Over the purple moor

Is there anybody here who thinks they're only serving on a raging storm
Is there anybody here with glory in their eyes
loyal to the end, whose duty is to die
I wanna see him
I wanna wish him luck
I wanna shake his hand, wanna call his name
Put a medal on the man.
Is there anybody here who'd like to wrap a flag around an early grave
Is there anybody here who thinks they're standing taller on a battle wave
Is there anybody here like to do his part",Is There Anybody Here?

Hup, two, three, four, marchin' down the street
Rollin' of the drums and the trampin' of the feet
General salutes and the mothers wave and weep
Here comes the big parade
Don't be afraid, price is paid

	So young, so strong, so ready for the war
	So willin' to go an' die upon a foreign shore

	So there is no one you can blame
	Don't be ashamed, light the flame

Listen for the thunder of the marching boys
Few years ago their guns were only toys

Kisses from the girls and cheers from the crowd
And the widows from the last war cry into their shrouds

Phil Ochs,"In a building of gold, with riches untold,
Lived the families on which the country was founded.
And the merchants of style, with their red velvet smiles,
Were there, for they also were hounded.

And the soft middle class crowded in to the last,
For the building was fully surrounded.
And the noise outside was the ringing of revolution.
Sadly they stared and sank in their chairs

And searched for a comforting notion.
And the rich silver walls looked ready to fall
As they shook in doubtful devotion.
The ice cubes would clink as they freshened their drinks,

Wet their minds in bitter emotion.
And they talked about the ringing of revolution.
We were hardly aware of the hardships they beared,
For our time was taken with treasure.

Oh, life was a game, and work was a shame,
And pain was prevented by pleasure.
The world, cold and grey, was so far away
In the distance only money could measure.

But their thoughts were broken by the ringing of revolution.
The clouds filled the room in darkening doom
As the crooked smoke rings were rising.
How long will it take, how can we escape

Someone asks, but no one's advising.
And the quivering floor responds to the roar,
In a shake no longer surprising.
As closer and closer comes the ringing of revolution.

Softly they moan, please leave us alone
As back and forth they are pacing.
And they cover their ears and try not to hear
With pillows of silk they're embracing.

And the crackling crowd is laughing out loud,
Peeking in at the target they're chasing.
Now trembling inside the ringing of revolution.
With compromise sway we give in half way

When we saw that rebellion was growing.
Now everything's lost as they kneel by the cross
Where the blood of christ is still flowing.
To late for their sorrow they've reached their tomorrow

And reaped the seed they were sowing.
Now harvested by the ringing of revolution.
In tattered tuxedos they faced the new heroes
And crawled about in confusion.

And they sheepishly grinned for their memoroes were dim
Of the decades of dark execution.
Hollow hands were raised; they stood there amazed
In the shattering of their illusions.

As the windows were smashed by the ringing of revolution.
Down on our knees we're begging you please,
We're sorry for the way you were driven.
There's no need to taunt just take what you want,

And we'll make amends, if we're living.
But away from the grounds the flames told the town
That only the dead are forgiven.
As they crumbled inside the ringing of revolution.",Ringing of Revolution
Phil Ochs,"And the crabs are crazy, they scuttle back and forth
The sand is burning
And the fish take flight and scatter from the sight
Their courses turning

As the seagulls rest on the cold cannon nest
The sea is churning

Of Santo Domingo

The fishermen sweat, they're pausing at their nets
The day's a-burning
As the warships sway and thunder in the bay
Loud the morning

But the boy on the shore is throwing pebbles no more
He runs a-warning
That the the marines have landed on the shores
Of Santo Domingo

The streets are still, there's silence in the hills
The town is sleeping
And the farmers yawn in the gray silver dawn
The fields they're keeping

As the first troops land and step into the sand
The flags are weaving
The marines have landed on the shores
Of Santo Domingo

The unsmiling sun is shining down upon
The singing soldiers
In the cloud dust whirl they whistle at the girls
They're getting bolder

The old women sigh, think of memories gone by
They shrug their shoulders
The marines have landed on the shores
Of Santo Domingo

Ready for the tricks, their bayonets are fixed
Now they are rolling
And the tanks make tracks past the trembling shacks
Where fear is unfolding

All the young wives afraid, turn their backs on the parade
With babes they're holding
The marines have landed on the shores
Of Santo Domingo

A bullet cracks the sound, the army hit the ground
The sniper is callin'
So they open their guns, a thousand to one
No sense in stalling

He clutches at his head and totters on the edge
Look how he's falling
The marines have landed on the shores
Of Santo Domingo

In the red plaza square, the crowds come to stare
The heat is leaning
And the eyes of the dead are turning every head
To the widows screaming

But the soldiers make a bid, giving candy to the kids
Their teeth are gleaming
The marines have landed on the shores
Of Santo Domingo

Up and down the coed, the generals drink a toast
The wheel is spinning
And the cowards and the whores are peeking
Through the doors to see who's winning

But the traitors will pretend that it's getting near the end
When it's beginning
The marines have landed on the shores
Of Santo Domingo

And the crabs are crazy, they scuttle back and forth
The sand is burning
And the fish take flight and scatter from the sight

Phil Ochs,"In the state of Mississippi many years ago

A boy of 14 years got a taste of southern law

He saw his friend a hanging and his color was his crime

And the blood upon his jacket left a brand upon his mind
 

CHORUS: Too many martyrs and too many dead

Too many lies too many empty words were said

Too many times for too many angry men

Oh let it never be again
 
His name was Medgar Evers and he walked his road alone
Like Emmett Till and thousands more whose names we'll never know
They tried to burn his home and they beat him to the ground
But deep inside they both knew what it took to bring him down
*chorus*

The killer waited by his home hidden by the night
As Evers stepped out from his car into the rifle sight
he slowly squeezed the trigger, the bullet left his side
It struck the heart of every man when Evers fell and died.
*chorus*

And they laid him in his grave while the bugle sounded clear
laid him in his grave when the victory was near
While we waited for the future for freedom through the land (*)
The country gained a killer and the country lost a man
*chorus*

Phil Ochs,"And the night comes again to the circle studded sky
The stars settle slowly, in lonliness they lie
'Till the universe expodes as a falling star is raised
Planets are paralyzed, mountains are amazed
But they all glow brighter from the briliance of the blaze
With the speed of insanity, then he dies.

In the green fields a turnin', a baby is born
His cries crease the wind and mingle with the morn
An assault upon the order, the changing of the guard
Chosen for a challenge that is hopelessly hard
And the only single sound is the sighing of the stars
But to the silence and distance they are sworn

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

Images of innocence charge him go on
But the decadence of destiny is looking for a pawn
To a nightmare of knowledge he opens up the gate
And a blinding revelation is laid upon his plate
That beneath the greatest love is a hurricane of hate
And God help the critic of the dawn.

So he stands on the sea and shouts to the shore,
But the louder that he screams the longer he's ignored
For the wine of oblivion is drunk to the dregs
And the merchants of the masses almost have to be begged
'Till the giant is aware, someone's pulling at his leg,
And someone is tapping at the door.

To dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance

Then his message gathers meaning and it spreads across the land
The rewarding of his pain is the following of the man
But ignorance is everywhere and people have their way
Success is an enemy to the losers of the day
In the shadows of the churches, who knows what they pray
For blood is the language of the band.

The Spanish bulls are beaten; the crowd is soon beguiled,
The matador is beautiful, a symphony of style
Excitement is estatic, passion places bets
Gracefully he bows to ovations that he gets
But the hands that are applauding are slippery with sweat
And saliva is falling from their smiles

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

Then this overflow of life is crushed into a liar
The gentle soul is ripped apart and tossed into the fire.
First a smile of rejection at the nearness of the night
Truth becomes a tragedy limping from the light
All the heavens are horrified, they stagger from the sight
As the cross is trembling with desire.

They say they can't believe it, it's a sacreligious shame
Now, who would want to hurt such a hero of the game?
But you know I predicted it; I knew he had to fall
How did it happen? I hope his suffering was small.
Tell me every detail, for I've got to know it all,
And do you have a picture of the pain?

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

Time takes her toll and the memory fades
but his glory is broken, in the magic that he made.
Reality is ruined; it's the freeing from the fear
The drama is distorted, to what they want to hear
Swimming in their sorrow, in the twisting of a tear
As they wait for the new thrill parade.

Yes, the eyes of the rebel have been branded by the blind
To the safety of sterility, the threat has been refined
The child was created to the slaughterhouse he's led
So good to be alive when the eulogy is read
The climax of emotion, the worship of the dead
And the cycle of sacrifice unwinds.

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance

What a world of merriment
Their melody foretells
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle
In the icy air of night
All the heavens seem to twinkle
With a crystalline delight
Keeping time, time, time
With a sort of Runic rhyme
From the tintinnabulation
That so musically wells
From the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells
From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells

Hear the mellow wedding bells
Golden bells
What a world of happiness
Their harmony foretells
Through the balmy air of night
How they ring out their delight
Through the dances and the yells
And the rapture that impels
How it swells
How it dwells
On the future
How it tells
From the swinging and the ringing of the molten golden bells
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells
Of the rhyming and the chiming of the bells

Hear the loud alarum bells
Brazen bells
What a tale of terror now
Their turbulency tells
Much too horrified to speak
Oh, they can only shriek
For all the ears to know
How the danger ebbs and flows
Leaping higher, higher, higher
With a desperate desire
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire
With the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells
With the clamor and the clanging of the bells

Hear the tolling of the bells
Iron bells
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels
For all the sound that floats
From the rust within our throats
And the people sit and groan
In their muffled monotone
And the tolling, tolling, tolling
Feels a glory in the rolling
From the throbbing and the sobbing
Of the melancholy bells
Oh, the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells
Oh, the moaning and the groaning of the bells.

Phil Ochs,"He walked all over his own growin' land
                            
From the New York island to the California sand

He saw all the people that needed to be seen

Planted all the grass where it needed to be green

  And now he's bound for a glory all his own

  And now he is bound for glory

He wrote and he sang and he rode upon the rails
And he got on board when the sailors had to sail
He said all the words that needed to be said
He fed all the hungry souls that needed to be fed

(chorus)

He sang in our streets and he sang in our halls
And he was always there when the unions gave a call
He did all the jobs that needed to be done
He always stood his ground when a smaller man would run
(chorus)

And its Pastures of Plenty wrote the dustbowl balladeer
And This Land is Your Land, he wanted us to hear
And the risin'  of the unions will be sung about again
And the Deportees live on through the power of his pen
(chorus)

Now they sing out his praises on every distant shore
But so few remember what he was fightin' for
Oh why sing the songs and forget about the aim?
He wrote them for a reason, why not sing them for the same

But it seems that every single dream's
Painted pretty pictures in the air
And it tumbles in despair

And it starts to bend
Until by the end its a nightmare
I'm gonna give all I've got to give
Cross my heart, and I hope to live

I don't know
But it's true, so many things you do
Please you so they leave feeling warm
It's the calm before the storm

For the habit grows and before you know it you're deformed
I'm gonna give all I've got to give
Cross my heart, and I hope to live
I don't know

But I see that every thing is free
When you're young and treasures you can take
But the bridge is gonna break
You reach the end screaming

""It's all been a mistake""
I'm gonna give all I've got to give
Cross my heart, and I hope to live

With the speed of insanity, then he dies.

In the green fields a turnin', a baby is born
His cries crease the wind and mingle with the morn
An assault upon the order, the changing of the guard
Chosen for a challenge that is hopelessly hard
And the only single sound is the sighing of the stars
But to the silence and distance they are sworn

'Cause we love you

Images of innocence charge him go on
But the decadence of destiny is looking for a pawn
To a nightmare of knowledge he opens up the gate
And a blinding revelation is laid upon his plate
That beneath the greatest love is a hurricane of hate
And God help the critic of the dawn.

So he stands on the sea and shouts to the shore,
But the louder that he screams the longer he's ignored
For the wine of oblivion is drunk to the dregs
And the merchants of the masses almost have to be begged
'Till the giant is aware, someone's pulling at his leg,
And someone is tapping at the door.

To dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

Then his message gathers meaning and it spreads accross the land
The rewarding of his pain is the following of the man
But ignorance is everywhere and people have their way
Success is an enemy to the losers of the day
In the shadows of the churches, who knows what they pray
For blood is the language of the band.

The Spanish bulls are beaten; the crowd is soon beguiled,
The matador is beautiful, a symphony of style
Excitement is estatic, passion places bets
Gracefully he bows to ovations that he gets
But the hands that are applauding are slippery with sweat
And saliva is falling from their smiles

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

Then this overflow of life is crushed into a liar
The gentle soul is ripped apart and tossed into the fire.
First a smile of rejection at the nearness of the night
Truth becomes a tragedy limping from the light
All the (canons|heavens) are horrified, they stagger from the sight
As the cross is trembling with desire.

They say they can't believe it, it's a sacreligious shame
Now, who would want to hurt such a hero of the game?
But you know I predicted it; I knew he had to fall
How did it happen?  I hope his suffering was small.
Tell me every detail, I've got to know it all,
And do you have a picture of the pain?

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

Time takes her toll and the memory fades
but his glory is broken, in the magic that he made.
Reality is ruined; it's the freeing from the fear
The drama is distorted, to what they want to hear
Swimming in their sorrow, in the twisting of a tear
As they wait for a new thrill parade.

The eyes of the rebel have been branded by the blind
To the safety of sterility, the threat has been refined
The child was created to the slaughterhouse he's led
So good to be alive when the eulogy is read
The climax of emotion, the worship of the dead
And the cycle of sacrifice unwinds.

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

And the night comes again to the circle studded sky
The stars settle slowly, in loneliness they lie
'Till the universe expodes as a falling star is raised

Phil Ochs,"Lost in the valley of vaults/dolls/Oz(?)
Fell from the path, it was nobody's fault
That I was alone.
Time dripped from the trees

Left through the nail (I leapt through alamp/land/lap/laugh(?) (?))
I fell to my knees before the throne
And the crown was covered jewels, sparkling schools
The beautiful fauns/falls/(?)

The magnificent battle was fought
And Cinderella's soldier fish was caught
And the lady from the lake
Who helped me to escape

Led me to myself at last
Though I danced with the dolls in the doll house
The flower fled from my feet,
Tom Sawyer voice through the hole of the key,

Landed so gently.
Castles cover the cave,
I had no choice, the visions were brave
And the phantoms were friendly,

And Pirate Jenny was dancing for pennies,
The knucklebones tossed in a spin,
There were silver songs on her skin.
And she wasn't caring when the ship came in.

And the lady from the lake
Helped me to escape
Led me to myself at last,
Though I danced with the dolls in the doll house

My costume dropped to the floor,
Naked at last, I couldn't fight any-more,
And the service was rendered.
A poem fell from the wine, buried the past.

The future was mine and the present sur-rendered.
And the ballet master is beckoning faster,
The ballerina was posed, in the fragile beauty we froze.
Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go.

And the lady from the lake
Who helped me to escape
Left me with myself at last

Phil Ochs,"The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees,
The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,
The road was a ribbon of moonlight, over the purple moor,
And the highwayman came riding-
Riding-riding-
The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.

He'd a french cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,
A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin;
They fitted with never a wrinkle: his boots were up to the thigh!
And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,
His pistol butts a-twinkle,
His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.

Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard,
And he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred;
He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there
But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,
Bess, the landlord's daughter,
Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.

And dark in the old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked
Where tim the ostler listened; his face was white and peaked;
His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,
But he loved the landlord's daughter,
The landlord's red-lipped daughter,
Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say-

""one kiss, my bonny sweetheart, i'm after a prize to-night,
But i shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;
Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,
Then look for me by moonlight,
Watch for me by moonlight,
I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.""

He rose upright in the stirrups; he scarce could reach her hand,
But she loosened her hair i' the casement! his face burnt like a brand
As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;
And he kissed its waves in the moonlight,
(oh, sweet black waves in the moonlight!)
Then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the west.

He did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon;
And out o' the tawny sunset, before the rise o' the moon,
When the road was a gipsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor,
A red-coat troop came marching-
Marching-marching-
King george's men came marching, up to the old inn-door.

They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead,
But they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed;
Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side!
There was death at every window;
And hell at one dark window;
For bess could see, through the casement, the road that he would ride.

They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest;
They bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!
""now keep good watch!"" and they kissed her.
She heard the dead man say-
Look for me by moonlight;
Watch for me by moonlight;
I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!

Iv
She twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good!
She writhed her hands till here fingers were wet with sweat or blood!
They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like
Years,
Till, now, on the stroke of midnight,
Cold, on the stroke of midnight,
The tip of one finger touched it! the trigger at least was hers!

V
The tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!
Up, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast,
She would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again;
For the road lay bare in the moonlight;
Blank and bare in the moonlight;
And the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love's refrain.

Vi
Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! had they heard it? the horse-hoofs
Ringing clear;
Tlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? were they deaf that they did
Not hear?
Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill,
The highwayman came riding,
Riding, riding!
The red-coats looked to their priming! she stood up strait and still!

Vii
Tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! tlot-tlot, in the echoing night
!
Nearer he came and nearer! her face was like a light!
Her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,
Then her finger moved in the moonlight,
Her musket shattered the moonlight,
Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him-with her death.

Viii
He turned; he spurred to the west; he did not know who stood
Bowed, with her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!
Not till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear
How bess, the landlord's daughter,
The landlord's black-eyed daughter,
Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.

Ix
Back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky,
With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!
Blood-red were his spurs i' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat,
When they shot him down on the highway,
Down like a dog on the highway,
And he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.

* * * * * *
X
And still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees,
When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,
When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,
A highwayman comes riding-
Riding-riding-
A highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.

Xi
Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard,
And he taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred;
He whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there
But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,

All that they are doin' is all that you have showed,
That you gotta strike, you gotta fight to get what you are owed,
When you're building all your links on the chain, on the chain,
When you're building all your links on the chain.

Amd the man who tries to tell you that they'll take your job away,
He's the same man who was scabbin' hard just the other day,
And your union's not a union till he's thrown out of the way,
And he's chokin' on your links of the chain, of the chain,
And he's chokin' on your links of the chain.

For now the times are tellin' you the times are rollin' on,
And you're fighting for the same thing, the jobs that will be gone,
Now it's only fair to ask you boys, which side are you on?
As you're buildin' all your links on the chain, on the chain,
As you're buildin' all your links on the chain",Links on the Chain

Would you like someone to solve them,
Would you like someone to share in your misery?

Her name's Miranda
She's a Rudolph Valentino fan
And she doesn't claim to understand
She bakes brownies for the boys in the band.

Early Sunday morning
When the sermon lines are forming
And Saturday night is the memories that it gave.
She's busy in the pantry, far away from Elmer Gantry
Who is busy baking souls that he may save.
Everybody's soul but Miranda (Chorus)
The dice of death are calling
While the truck of time is falling
By the thumb stuck out on the highway of the years.
The tollgate at the turnpike is ignored by those who hitch-hike
And the Howard Johnson food is made of fear
But not Miranda (Chorus)
The sun burnt skin is peeling
On the doctors who are healing
And the license plates are laughing on the car.
The pain is so exciting
And everyone's inviting
You to look upon their operation scars.
But not Miranda

While commercial planes are crashing

(Chorus)

In the bar we're gin and scotching
While the FBI is watching
They are tape recording every other word
The bartender is bleeding
Pardon me, I just was leaving

I've got to follow them wherever they may lead
For I am just a sailor on a ship across the land

The answer lies in limbo(?) and the harvest will be hard
But sacred are the scars
That leave their mark on the fast disolving years

It's that I've always known
But I won or lost alone
And when a voice calls out ""there's someone you must meet""
With every strength remaining
I will suffer one more scene
I'll gather all my dreams
And with my final breath
I'll lay them at your feet.

A sailor from the sea
He looks a lot like me
I'd know him anywhere, had to stare 

Feathers at his fingertips
A halo 'round his spine
He must have lost his mind
He should be put away, right away

In the corner of the night
He handed me his waterpipe
His eyes were searching deep inside my head
Here's what he said

Sorry I can't stop and talk now
I'm in kind of a hurry anyhow
But I'll send you a tape from California
New York city has exploded and it's crashed upon my head

I dove beneath the bed
Fighting, biting nails, turning pale
The landlord's at my window
And the burglar's at my door

I can't take it anymore
I guess I'll have to fly, it's worth a try
Someone's banging on the wall
But there's no party to recall

The singer of the shadows of his soul
So he's been told
Sorry I can't stop and talk now
I'm in kind of a hurry anyhow

But I'll send you a tape from California
From the mirror of my mantle to the velvet on my bed
Trapped upon a stolen stage, a Barrymore at best(?)
My rhymes are all repeating, ballads growing blind

Words have turned to water, the women turned to wine
The draft board is debating if they'd like to take my life
I'd sooner take a wife and have raise a child or two
Wouldn't you?

Peace has turned to poison
The flag has blown a fuse
Even courage is confused
And now all the brave are in the grave

Century is bending(?)
Have a very happy ending
To the victor go the ashes of the spoil
Seeds in the soil

Sorry I can't stop and talk now
I'm in kind of a hurry anyhow
But I'll send you a tape from California
The flower-power fuller brush man

Is farming out his friends
I stabbed him with my stem
And then I tapped his toes with my rose
He crawled around inside himself

Now he's crawling after me
Dropping acid in my tea
He wants to save his soul
Rock and roll

One of us must understand
It's not the drug that makes the man
Then a poster of a movie star walked by
He must have been high

So who's that coming down the road

A sailor from the sea
He looks a lot like me
I'd know him anywhere
Had to stare

A fire around his fingertips
A song around his spine

Phil Ochs,"Over the ashes of blood marched the civilized soldiers,
Over the ruins of the french fortress of a failure
Over the silent screams of the dead and the dying
Saying please be reassured, we seek no wider war.
The treaties were signed, the country was split into sections
But growing numbers of prisons were built for protection
Rapidly filling with people who called for elections
But please be reassured, we seek no wider war.
Ngo Dinh diem was the puppet who danced for the power
The hero of hate who gambled on hell for his hour
Father of his country was stamped on the medals we showered
But please be reassured, we seek no wider war.
Machine gun bullets became the bloody baptizers
And the falcon copters don't care if someone's the wiser
But the boy in the swamp didn't know he was killed by advisers
So please be reassured, we seek no wider war.
And fires were spitting at forests in defoliation
While the people were pressed into camps not called concentration
And the greater the victory the greater the shame of the nation
But please be reassured, we seek no wider war.
While we were watching the prisoners were tested by torture
And vicious and violent gasses maintained the order
As the finest Washington minds found slogans for slaughter 
But please be reassured, we seek no wider war.
Then over the border came the bay of pigs planes of persuasion
All remaining honor went up in flames of invasion
But the shattered schools never learned that it's not escalation
But please be reassured, we seek no wider war.
We're teaching freedom for which they are yearning
While were dragging them down to the path of never returning
But, we'll condescend to talk while the cities are burning
But please be reassured, we seek no wider war.
And the evil is done in hopes that evil surrenders
But the deeds of the devil are burned too deep in the embers
And a world of hunger in vengeance will always remember
So please be reassured, we seek no wider war,

Phil Ochs,"In the fire blue forests, faded and forgotten
I crawled through the cotton fields, picking for cotton
The overseer sneered, his whipping was rotten
With ecstasy.

I'm child-like terror I tore out the tap roots
Cards of the lash were calling to follow suit
I dashed for the swamps, the hounds in hot pursuit
Jealously.

All through the night a figure of fright, as I hid my head
And the buried their nose in a cut of my cloths, now torn in shreds
And they never would leave until they believed that I was dead
But I'd never curse their names

Oh, who am I to blame
I know I'd do the same
Endlessly.
And all the high-born ladies

So lovely and so true,
Have been handed to the soldiers
When in Rome do as the Romans do.
Frail and afraid in the mists of the morning

The snakes and the spiders were sadly performing
The bark of the dogs kept up the warning
Inside the wood.
Sweating and swearing I crawled from the manger

The highway appeared to take me from danger
Is there anyone here who would pick up a stranger?
Oh I wish you could.
Then someone replied ""would you like a ride?""

""Come in"" he said.
We drove for a while, he gave me a smile and a piece of bread
The hammer was hard in the chrome of the car as I cracked his head
Then we took off in a spin

Oh I smashed his skull again
Oh thank you my good friend,
I feel so good.
And all the high-born ladies

So lovely and so true,
Have been handed to the soldiers
When in Rome do as the Romans do.
Late in the evening I came to the city

I fell to the sidewalks sighing for pity
A diamond was dropped from the hands of the pretty
To be so kind.
Cowards and corpses were busy competing

The rhymes of the riots were busy repeating
I raced to the corner and sped(?) from the speeding
To save my mind.
Latches and locks, companies of cops ran from the rain

There was silk in the stores for the whims of the whores
That shone with shame.
I asked for a light from a priest in the night
Then I fanned the flames.

And the traffic all stood still
To see if someone had been killed
I was glad to leave a thrill
So far behind.

And all the high-born ladies
So lovely and so true,
Have been handed to the soldiers
When in Rome do as the Romans do.

A monk and his mother were dancing so dandy
A topless nun was handing out candy
The beautiful bishop broke out the brandy
The kiss we crave.

They stuttered and stammered, would I feel like staying
We fell to our knees, feverishly praying
the salt in the salt-peter seemed to be saying
Be brave, be brave.

I reached reached for a robe, I preached and I probed
And I taught the tune.
And the greed for the gills was played to the hilt
As I promised doom

I toyed with their fears, until coins and tears filled the room
Then I took off down the road
Laughing madly like a toad
God bless every soulless soul

That would be saved.
And all the high-born ladies
So lovely and so true,
Have been handed to the soldiers

When in Rome do as the Romans do.
A chorus of children were passing the hours
I joined in their fun and gave them my flowers
Covered with kisses and showered with showers

That they repaid.
Taken and trusting, would I be their teacher?
She looked so appealing, I wanted to touch her
Just out of reach, unable to reach her

Their hands were raised.
Charmed by the chalk, the lessons were taught, inside the class
They studied the rules of the samurai schools, they had to pass
The room was adjourned, the lessons were learned,

I turned on the gas
And I watched them make their pleas
They passed the test with ease
I gave them their degrees,

They made the grade.
And all the high-born ladies
So lovely and so true,
Have been handed to the soldiers

When in Rome do as the Romans do.
Feeling my weakness, a coward for company
I joined the ranks of the hot and hungry
To teach what it means to have love for your country

We marched away.
We lowered our lives for the lines of a border
We danced with the mothers, played with the daughters
We followed our fantasies, following orders

It was child's play.
After the war the bullets were bored so we capped the game
With cynical smiles we put them on trial to place the blame
Now what kind of beast would love such a feast

Have you no shame?
So we hung the by the feet
Oh, we shot them in the street
Oh, the victory was sweet

on victory day.
And all the high-born ladies
So lovely and so true,
Have been handed to the soldiers

When in Rome do as the Romans do.
The bread and the circuses came to be nearing
The Saviour or somebody must be appearing
Pagans and pageants were all disappearing

Inside my head.
The stones on the statues were staring and stalling
Caesar and Cassius were cursing and calling
The empire had risen and now it was falling

Or so it seemed.
The crown and the cross seemed empty and lost in dark despair
And luminous lies, death in disguise were everywhere
The canvas was cold, the story was old, I said my prayers

Then I crowned him on the head
Oh, I blessed him as he bled
Oh At last, the king is dead
God save the queen.

And all the high-born ladies
So lovely and so true,
Have been handed to the soldiers
When in Rome do as the Romans do.

Now nothing remained for building or burning
The losing of lovers was all I was learning
A time for escape and a time for returning had come to me
Back through the ashes and back through the embers

Back through the roads and the ruins I remembered
My hands at my side I sadly surrendered
Do as you please.
The hero was home, proven and grown, I fell on the floor

Mad with romance they started to dance, their star was born
I bled like the rain, exploded in pain, then I screamed for more
Oh, make me feel sublime
Release me from my mind

Oh, Kill me one more time
And set me free.
And all the high-born ladies
So lovely and so true,

Have been handed to the soldiers
When in Rome do as the Romans do.",When in Rome

They spread their sheets upon the ground just like a wandering tribe
And the wise men walked in their Robespierre robes
Through Lincoln Park the dark was turning
The towers trapped and trembling, and the boats were tossed about
When the fog rolled in and the gas rolled out
From Lincoln Park the dark was turning
Turning

Like wild horses freed at last we took the streets of wine
But I searched in vain for she stayed behind
In Lincoln Park the dark was turning

And tell my friend she lies in stone

In one who never gave enough to me?

And so many years gone, love that was so wrong
And I can't forget the way it used to be
And how you change the taste of love for me

You were my one more chance I never thought I'd find
You were the one romance I've always known in my mind
No one will ever touch me more and I only hope that in return
I might've saved the best of me for you

And we'll have no ending, no, no, if we can hold on

you could imagine
and many times her eyes fought back the tears
and when her youthful world 
was about to fall in
each time her slender shoulders
bore the weight of all her fears
and a sorrow no one hears
still rings in midnight silence, 
in her ears

Let her cry, for she's a lady
let her dream, for she's a child
let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower, 
growing wild

and if by chance I should hold her
let me hold her for a time
but if allowed just one possession
I would pick her from the garden, 
to be mine

Be careful how you touch her, 
for she'll awaken
and sleep's the only freedom that she knows
and when you walk into her eyes, 
you won't believe
the way she's always paying
for a debt she never owes
and a silent wind still blows
that only she can hear and so she goes

Let her cry, for she's a lady
let her dream, for she's a child

let the rain fall down upon her

That's when the animals come out to play.

Chattering gaily, they seem to shout.

It's the monkeys, dancing about.

Now the large cats are joining the party.
First comes the cheetah, the fastest of all.
Next is the tiger, the lynx, then the leopard.
They prowl through the jungle and they give their call.

Into the clearing, quiet and graceful
Comes a tall spotted creature and her baby calf.
Her legs are slender, her long neck is turning.
She towers above them all -- the tall giraffe.

Chorus

Slithering slowly, scales on their bodies.
Long and slender, they crawl on the ground.
Tongues a-darting, wiggling gaily,
The snakes join the party, but they don't make a sound.

Chorus

Into the clearing comes a large gray creature.
The ground is shaking as he starts to run
Round in a circle with his long trunk waving.
It's the elephant, joining the fun.

Chorus

Off in the shadows, still and quiet,
His long mane is flowing and he's standing tall.
When he's angry, he'll roar like thunder.
It's the lion and he's king of them all.

Stay inside

What made you leave?

Always missing
One for rain and one for shine

Remember me?
I used to be something didn't I?

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Sing, I do hear them singing

Was a jolly happy soul,
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal.

Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say,
He was made of snow 
But the children know 
How he came to life one day.

There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found.
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around.

O, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be,
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me.

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop.
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler ""Stop!""

Frosty the snow man
Had to hurry on his way,
But he waved goodbye saying,
""Don't you cry, I'll be back again some day.""

Better not pout, I'm telling you why
