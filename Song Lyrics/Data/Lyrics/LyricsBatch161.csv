Too far gone ain't no way back

Too far gone ain't no way back
Too far gone ain't no way back
Too far gone ain't no way back

Release my soul I lost control
Release my soul I've lost control

Too far gone

Ain't no way back here
Ain't no way back here
Ain't no way back here

Too far gone, I'm too far gone

I lost control, I sold my soul
I sold my soul, I lost control
I lost control, I﻿ sold my soul

Read the box Adonis, let's go
When I hear that sound
I wanna go underground",No Way Back
Hardis,"I remember holdin' on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

[Chorus]
But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I only miss you here every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin' up from the Caribbean
Most Novembers I break down and cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

[Chorus]

Goodbye, goodbye.","Hello, Goodbye"

Hardline,"Well we've come this far, it should last forever
Something here so strong, it's holding us together
Everything I do, well I do for you, I didn't mean to let you down
And if I lose control somehow you'll always know
That I'll come back around, alright

I've got this feeling, I can't shake it, alright
Hey baby, hey baby, can't let you walk away

'Cause you're everything I want, you've got everything I need

Hardline,"Alright
Here comes daddy with the strap again, toward my backside with the boggled end
Sing it - yeah, yeah, yeah - life's a bitch, yeah
He said I'll teach you something by the back of my hand
School can't teach you how to fight like a man
Sing it - yeah, yeah, yeah - life's a bitch
I can hear myself screamin' at the backdoor, yeah
An' I'm numb from the hitting, can't take no more, I can't take no more

Here comes mama with the golden rule
Sayin' me and the boys are just dreamin' fools, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
An' I catch myself dreamin' of the wild side, yeah

Hardline,"Hey girl what are you tryin' to do
You've been staring at yourself in the mirror for an hour or two
Hey girl who are ya tryin' to be
Are you painting yourself a picture of you and me

No nobody knows you like I do
Like I do

[Refrain:]
And you run run run
From the one you love
And you run run run
From the world we own

Hey girl what are we supposed to do
Are you leaving it up to the heavens for guiding you
Hey girl don't be surprised if one day
You take another look in that mirror
And regret your ways

No nobody knows you like I do
Like I do",Hey Girl
Hardline,"Hello I've come to follow
I'll crawl into your web
It's your words I'll hear and swallow
It's your voice I'll need and beg
There's always always ways you say

[Chorus]
But you hold me down
I didn't see it coming
Losing ground
Feel it all around you
Hold me down
Every way I turn it's
Holding me down
Hold me down
Ease it in the morning
Losing ground
Can't you hear I'm falling
Hold me down
Every way I turn you
Hold me down

Hello I've come to follow
I'll slip inside time
I need your voice inside me
I fear you now you're mine
There's always always ways you say

What you trying to do to me
What you trying to make me feel

Can you feel",Hold Me Down
Hardline,"Ice cold touching the dead life living in nowhere
Nobody knows how gone
My mind's buried in six feet weight of the world's
Been dragging me down too long
Can't explain the pain that eats away the way I want to be
Drowning in a pool of flesh and blood you ask too much of me
Can't feel a thing but the hole in the wall

[Refrain:]
Paralyzed... nothing moves me
Set in stone for a thousand days
And though I lie
I know I've got a reason for you
Paralyzed...

Shock me into daylight leading the stone blind
Turning my eyes away
From too much suffering hey life's guilty as sin
But only myself to blame
Try and try but I can't break the silence leave it all unsaid
My life leads to nowhere far away from all that's in my head
What did I do... did I do it again

[Refrain]

Go go on ahead
I'm just gonna crawl to you my only friend... denial
Time and time again I relive the fall
Trapped within I'm drowning in the bleeding of my heart

Can't feel a thing but the hole in the wall",Paralyzed
Hardline,"I should have let you know
I should have had the balls to say
I tripped my faith and fell on my face
I should have of let you find your peace
Your peace of mind and now you're my...

Weight weight weight weight weight weight
It's what you are it's what you are the...
Weight weight weight weight weight weight
It's what you are it's what you are to me

I should have let you know

You slipped my mind almost tried
So where you gonna find
Where you gonna find your peace
It's over done and you're my...

[Refrain]

Every single day is hard to find when you want to shine
Every single day is like you're blind
And let me save it save it
Go and let the world pass you by
And I wouldn't let ya
See no love I see no love see no love
Feel no love",Weight
Hardline,"Don't walk away
I didn't mean to put you through it
It's just my way
The only way that I can say it
Never again
Will I ever turn to stone
Sometimes words are better left alone
Look what you started
Never again

[Refrain:]
Your eyes
I'm looking through it all with your eyes
Your eyes
I'm looking at the world with your eyes

If I could take
And make it all just start again
Just my way
The only way that I could make it
Never again
Will I ever leave you alone
Sometimes words are better when they're known
Look what you started
Never again

Hardwell,"Sometimes it feels like my life’s a battle
And I think I’m losing my mind
When all that surrounds me is made of shadows

I’m just a lost soul that’s made of paper
But your touch can color the white
And bring back the beauty into my life

‘Cause it’s a mad world but it’s crazy
Crazy how you make the bad turn to amazing
And I don’t want to lose this now
I don’t want to lose this now
No, I don’t want to lose this now
‘Cause it’s a mad world

Were both strangers finding our way together
Like two lights that dance through the dark
We shine bright and fade out into forever

And I’m trying to hold back the way I’m feeling
But you make me come back to life
Yeah, you’ve got me going insane tonight (tonight, tonight)

‘Cause it’s a mad world but it’s crazy
Crazy how you make the bad turn to amazing
And I don’t want to lose this now
I don’t want to lose this now
No, I don’t want to lose this now
‘Cause it’s a mad world

‘Cause it’s a mad world, oh oh",Mad world
Hardwell,"I wake up smiling every morning
Yeah, I don't mind sleeping alone
People ask me if I don't miss you

Nights when we went out together
When it was us against the world

Hardwell,"I know a place where
We can head up there
Sail on the sunset, to the sky
Wave to the people
Everyone you know, up on a satellite
'Cause we go, we go
Watching cities and streets come to life
Yeah you know, you know
We're just starting, we're learning to fly

Head for the stars, be who we are
Living like creatures of the night
Never grow old, stay young in our soul
We can outrun the daylight
And we do, what we wanna do
And we do, what we wanna do
Do what we want, be who we are

Living like creatures, creatures, creatures
Of the night
Living like creatures, creatures, creatures
Of the night
Living like creatures, creatures, creatures
Of the night

Over the rainbow, chasing the shadows
You know the story's just begun
Rocking the blue jeans, jammin' to Springsteen
Baby, we're born to run
'Cause we go, we go
Watching cities and streets come to life
Yeah you know, you know
We're just starting, we're learning to fly

Harem,"My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
And as I go my way alone,
I find it hard for me to carry on.
I need your strength, 
I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear, I miss so much.
 
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
From this old world I try to hide my face,
But from this loneliness there's no hiding place.
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell,
in darkness with memories I know so well.
 
I need your love more than before,
I can hardly carry on anymore.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe, 
without you babe,without you babe,
My mind and soul have felt like this,
Since love between us no more exist.
And each time that darkness falls,
if finds me alone with these four walls.
 
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.

Harem Scarem,"Any night that you're lonely
Can be the night
Your conscience
Gets a little too much
You're torn by your freedom
You're safe in chains
Is you life made of diamonds or dust

Would you surrender it all
I gotta know

Do you want my touch
Would it hurt too much
There's nothing stranger than love
Do you want (Do you want my touch)
Do you feel (Would it hurt too much)
There's nothing stranger than love
Do you want my love
In times of confusion
We never know
If the emotions we feel are enough
And then out of nowhere we remember
That there's nothing stranger than love

Would you surrender it all
I gotta know

Between the two of us
You know it's more than enough",Stranger Than Love
Harem Scarem,"I feared the notion - I'd fall at your feet
And pour out my heart and you'll leave forever
Severe emotions and dark memories
They all end the same - a nosedive endeavor

But angels did fly and flooded boats sailed
To rescue my heart and pull out every nail
Things don't seem right since I've fallen

I'm falling like rain for everything about you
I find myself chained - thinking I'm coming loose
It's everything about you

A deep devotion has washed on our sands
Took hold of our hands and guides us forever
Holy water that some of us brave
They're poetic slaves - drowned by their conscience

Angels did fly - the loneliness fails
To capture my heart and push in every nail
Things turn out right since I've fallen



",Rain
Harem Scarem,"I stand before you
Accused of many crimes
But I want to believe
That love can still survive

You don't have to say it,
I don't have to read your mind
To know the emptiness
That's finally arrived

How was I,
To know the right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken,
So where did I go wrong?

Tell me honestly
If you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes, honestly!

Words will have more meaning,
If they're said at certain times
Now the all they've seen
I found to be a lie

How would you know it,
You won't give me sometime
To see if everything could work out,
And you'll be mine

Oh, will love be lost forever
But someday I will find
The world we've all been searching for
Or just some peace of mind..

Tell me honestly
If you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes, honestly!

Tell me honestly
If you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes, honestly!

All the night I sit and wonder
Must be more to laugh, I'm sure that
Days and years gone by while I am
Living with the..
Oh, lonely feeling

Tell me honestly
If you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes, honestly!

Tell me honestly
If you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes, honestly!",Honestly
Harem Scarem,"It's only life
I remind myself each day
If only I could remember what I'm doing in a room
The walls are padded down with foam

Because it takes away the sound
And alters the voices that tell me to do
What I do
They're worried that I'll want to kill

Without my pills
And they knew that I'd do
What I do
One more try

To step inside my brain
A constant fight
But I won't sleep till I can fool them
For hours they make me stare at blotches

I failed the grade
When I told them I was Jesus and I hear voices
That tell me to do what I do",What I Do
Harem Scarem,"You come on like a sweet child here drive me wild when I want you
You giving me a rough time then you change your mind then you want me
You come so close, but you never stay
You take my heart, and then you walk away

You're hard to love, but it's hard to let you go
I need you now, but I'm afraid of letting you know
It's hard to love, and never understand
How it slips right through your hands

I want to say you're mine but acting like you don't know me
All I need is one night just to make it right when you're lonely
I got to know if we can make it last

Can't pretend I don't want you to know
Every touch leaves your mark on me
Little things seem to haunt me now
I can't believe you've become a part of me",Hard to Love
Harem Scarem,"I lie awake all through the night
And think of you to break the morning light
Thoughts in my head, gotta make you understand
That love is what you need, won't let you slip through my hands

You said you'd never leave, and I guess you could be wrong
I won't have anyone to blame,I won't have anyone at all

With a little love, I keep holding onto you forever
With a little love, we can see it through together
I try to wait and just hold on
There's so many things I believe could go wrong

So I close my eyes, and pray for the day
That we can take all the lies and just throw them away

You said you'd never leave, and I guess you could be wrong
I won't have anyone to blame, I won't have anyone at all",With a Little Love
Harem Scarem,"Climbed these walls
For hours that feel like days
From highs I fall
To watching the pain drying

The walls that I walked through
And the truth bent
To get to you
'Cause I need you

Where do I belong
Won't get through all my bleak moods
Without you
My resolve

Is a tower that fails to break
Life's a bomb
That can blow you eight ways from Sunday
Blue surrounds me

Blue all around me
Only you can change the tides
Hoping you can decide our fate",Without You
Harem Scarem,"Well, it was something that took me by surprise
Just when I tried to re-arrange my life
Well then I find out the things that I didn't really want to know
(No, it's not easy, you know it ain't easy)
Trying to get ahead in the world
All of a sudden it came over me and now I finally know

[Chorus]
Even the hard times are good times
But I'd do it all over again
Even when I can't see what I've left behind me
I'd do it all over, do it all over again

Noticing now, there's some new things in my life
I try to turn them around, but it's too late to change my mind
(No, it's not easy, you know it ain't easy)
Trying to get ahead in the world
All of sudden it came over me and now I finally know

Got my head above the water on the rise
And I feel alone although you walk beside

Still I fear what I'll find
If I hear you say the word goodbye

When all is said and done
You're still the one
Taking me higher
When all is said and done
I still need your love
You're taking me higher

Yeah I'm shedding all the skin that has disguised me
And I'm taking all the wrongs to make them right
Said my prayers and now I put it all behind me

Still I fear what I'll find
If I hear you say the word goodbye

When all is said and done
You're still the one
Taking me higher
When all is said and done
I still need your love
You're taking me higher

Into the light
Giving me energy
Into the light

Taking me higher
When all is said and done
I still need your love
You're taking me higher",Higher

It's gotten so bad so bad
Won't do what you wanna

So you throw away the noose
That's been holding you down
Watching your back

Maybe we're caught up in the lies
But we're holding on
Yeah we're holding on
We're so far across the line
Even we don't know why we're holding on

You're never moving
Cause you're on it and off it
You're going nowhere
Cause you're searching

For the midnight sun
That's been long dead and gone
So you throw away the noose
That's been holding you down

Far to blind to see

Wait and you'll find me
If you get lost and you don't know where to go
Just wait and you'll find me

It's all up to you

Before I'm gonna be so far down that I can't find it

Yeah I'll break free and run
And all my fears are gone
Reach for the sun
Yeah our road will be long
And all my fears are gone

I'm never gonna leave the ground with tired wings of lead
And I'm always gonna be a prisoner to all the things I've said
I know I gotta bleed the endless wounds and the cuts I have
Cause they're taking over me and it makes me feel like I'm living dead

Til I can't breathe
I can't see
I can't feel
If I'm real

Harem Scarem,"Embrace the love you find 
Cuz today is only time 
That slips through your hands 
And forever leaves you behind 

Yesterday life was alright 
But now a memory 
Cuz today I only find 
Hell surrounding me 

Caught on a thinner wire 
Looking down in the fire 
Hanging on another day 
You fall to pieces 
With heaven at your feet 
You're gonna find another way 
The only reason 
Anything should be

Until I find the key

If it's our fate then we better seal it
Right or wrong

There were some highs and some lows
We're living in the afterglow

Since I burned out on you

Calm and numb was never so appealing

Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

And in summer she blessed me with a child

How do you tell him his daddy's goin' away?
Do I tell him that I reached the autumn of my life

Harlemm Lee,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

We're sold, we're done now
Every moment feels the same
The first time I saw you
You were chasing down again

I'm not the one to provide
I'm not the homicide
You've got all you wanted
Everything to hide

Arms open, unspoken
Every moment feels the same
Capsize the tall tale but you will always fail

Sit down, you will fall apart?
That's when the trouble starts
From the top I counted you out
Life can be so hard

",Dumb
Harmful,"Banish my soul? Gather to a head, someday
We all live our lies so oversized
Unleash my thoughts? I wish I could wipe from this place
All around my head? It's overfed

I don't know if anyone holds the line?
You and me gonna need some time to wash away the lies

Again we're told to shut it down
Although it's cold, place my demands to understand
Control my hopes, everyone denies to fail
Why can't we find our own delight

I don't know if anyone holds the line?
You and me gonna need some time to wash away the lies
I don't know if anyone holds the line?
You and me gonna need some time to wash away the lies

I don't want to lose myself again
Don't want to be my one and only friend
In a moment of pure self help you win

Banish my soul? Gather to a head, someday
We all live our lies so oversized
Unleash my thoughts? I wish I could wipe from this place
All around my head? It's overfed

I don't know if anyone holds the line?
You and me gonna need some time to wash away the lies
I don't know if anyone holds the line?
You and me gonna need some time to wash away the lies

I don't know if anyone holds the line?
You and me gonna need some time to wash away the lies
I don't know if anyone holds the line?
You and me gonna need some time to wash away the lies

I don't know if anyone holds the line?
You and me gonna need some time to wash away the lies
I don't know if anyone holds the line?
You and me gonna need some time

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Any style that would back her
They say she's a chooser
But I just can't refuse her
She was just there, but then she can't be here no more

And as my mind unwheels
I feel the freeze down in my knees
But just before she leaves, she receives

She's been down in the dunes
And she's dealt with the goons
Now she drinks from a bitter cup
I'm trying to get her to give it up
She was just here, I fear she can't be there no more

It's long, long when she's gone
I get weary holding on
Now I'm coldly fading fast
I don't think I'm gonna last very much longer

She's stoned said the Swede, and the moon calf agreed
I'm like a viper in shock with my eyes in the clock

Harmony,"Don't you remember my name now
Here at the end of all things
I am the on that you lived for
And the one that you killed

Don't you remember my words now
Here at the turn of the tide
I am the one that you clinged to
I heard your call every night

Am I too blind to see to trust in these words
Am I too numb to feel what will become of me

Don't turn away the path before you all clear
Don't turn away one thought and nothing is lost
Don't turn away from me now

I weep over you when you cry
It is a thorn in my side
But if I lead will you follow
Me to the end of the times

Am I too blind to see to trust in these words
Am I too numb to feel what will become of me

Don't turn away the path before you lies all clear
Don't turn away one thought and nothing is lost

Harold Arlen,"It`s the wonder of the world, It`s a rocket to the moon
It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...

Here`s to my best romance, Here`s to my worst romance
Here`s to my first romance - ages ago
Here`s to the boys I`ve kissed, and to complete the list
Here`s to the boys who said ""No!""

Love, love, hooray for love
Who was ever too blase for love
Make this the night for love
If we have to fight, let`s fight for love

Some sigh and cry for love
Ah, but in Pa-ree they die for love
Some waste away for love
Just the same - hooray for love!

 It`s the rocket to the moon, with a touch of ""Clare de Lune""
 It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...

Some trust to fate for love,
Others have to take off weight for love
Some go berzerk for love
Loafers even go to work for love

Sad songs are sobbed for love
People have their noses bobbed for love
Some say we pay for love
Just the same - hooray for love!",Hooray for Love
Harold Arlen,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young
Harold Arlen,"Maybe I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Life isn't long enough baby, but I can love you as long as I live.

Maybe I can't give you diamonds and things like I want to,
But I can promise you, baby, I'm gonna want to as long as I live.

I never cared, but now I'm scared, I won't live long enough.
That's why I wear my rubbers when it rains and eat an apple every day then see
the doctor anyway.

What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.

I'll even wear long underwear, when winter breezes blow
I'm gonna take good care of me because, a sneeze or two might mean the flu,
And that would never never do

What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.",As Long as I Live
Harold Arlen,"Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings
What do they tell and what is the spell they cast
Some of them fall and seem to recall the past
But most of them rise away to the skies of blue
Oh little smoke rings I love",Smoke Rings
Harold Ashby,"Hear me, why you keep fooling
Little coquette, making fun of the one who loves you
Breaking hearts you are ruling
Little coquette, true hearts tenderly dreaming of you.
Someday you'll fall in love as I fell in love with you.
Maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets, 
You know, my little coquette, I love you.

A tiny velvet box,

One perfect little rock,
A little thing, just a ring,

Where loves a corner stone,
We'll have children, they'll have children,

Skipping rocks, and dodging lots of
Sticks and stones,

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Harold McNair,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere"
Harold Melvin,"Hey, lady, can I say something to you for a minute?
Please? No, Now before you take your coat off, That's it
I got something to tell you
See, what I have to say is so very important to our relationship
Why is it that every time we go out on the town, we get around our friends?
Man, you're always talking about what you got, huh
Went out and bought for you
How much money I make
And what school our children go to
And all the fancy clothes and big pretty cars
The big diamond rings, and them fantastic mink coats
Is you for real? No, I don't think you are
Sit down, No, no, sit down
Now don't say nothing, You see
Wait a minute, wait a minute, that is your problem
That is your problem, You're always saying the wrong tthing at the right time
You see I don't--I don't know how to explain this to you
The best I can tell you is what my mother told me as I was coming up
She used to say, ""Son, chances go 'round,""
She said, ""The same people that you meet going up
They make the same old faces coming down,""
Heh, tell the truth
You see, people today, they come out there to party
They come out to party, man
They didn't come out to hear all that jive mess you talking about
You standing up in the corner with a bottle of champagne taking about
Harry, Joe, and Dick and Bobby and what they ain't got
And they live down in the lower development homes, and you won't even help
You won't even buy 'em a drink
Is that any way to meet them?
If you're gonna boast, boast around somebody that has what you have
Don't make your own brothers and sisters feel bad
You see Listen
I know you know what I'm talking about because from time to time
I can remember you coming to me putting your head on my shoulder and crying
""Oh, papa, why? Why? Why don't nobody wanna be my friend?""
You told me a long time ago, You said, ""Papa, what am I doing?""
I didn't wanna tell you that
I thought you had sense enough to realize what you're doing, but I see you don't
Sit down and listen to me, No, sit down!
You see, people are too sensitive today
They don't wanna hear all that jive you talking back
You see, they don't wanna hear about what you got
cause they're trying to get it, too
Heh, tell the truth
I can't very much blame her
As much as it hurts me, it hurts to see people
going around behind our backs saying that
""This woman this, this woman that,"" or ""she ain't this"" or ""she ain't that""
I wanna be proud of you, mama
I wanna be proud of you
Listen, as long as you live
As long as you live whether you're with me or not

No, if you're smartly dressed, Hey, baby, Hey, baby
What you should be doing is getting down on your knees every night
And thanking the man above for being blessed right now

If you want your friends to think you're starting with a smile
Be for real, girl
Just be, be for real, (Be for real)

Putting people down is less best to you

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday

To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet

With those blues on parade

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose

Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steam.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they dream.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

Good night, America, how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.",City of New Orleans

He left her cryin' on her wedding day
And went to fight the battle of the Blue and Gray

Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary just you wait for me
The war's gonna soon be over
Oh Mary don't you weep

Mary's young heart was filled with joy
When she got the letter from her soldier boy
His words of love made her heart beat fast
But little did she know it would be the last

Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary just you wait for me
The battle will soon be over
Oh Mary don't you weep

On that same day Atlanta burned down
Her soldier boy he fell to the ground
Now Mary sits alone by the candle light
And reads his letter over every night

Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary just you wait for me
The war's gonna soon be over
Oh Mary don't you weep

HARP,"The water is wide, I cannot cross over,
And neither have I wings to fly,
Give me a boat that can carry two,
And both shall row, my love and I.

A ship there was, and she sails the sea,
She's loaded deep as deep can be,
But not so deep as the love I'm in,
And I know not how, I sink or swim.

I leaned my back up against some young oak,
Thinking he was a trusty tree,
But first he bended and then he broke,
And thus did my false love to me.

I put my hand into some soft bush,
Thinking the sweetest flower to find.
I pricked my finger to the bone,
And left the sweetest flower alone.

Oh, love is handsome, love is fine,
Gay as a jewel, when first it is new,
But love grows old, and waxes cold,
And fades away, like summer dew.

The seagulls wheel, they turn and dive,
The mountain stands beside the sea.
This world we know turns round and round,
And all for them - and you and me.",The Water Is Wide

The sun is sinking down
I'm standing 'round my window
You say you're going away
But I believe in love

CHORUS:
The power of love divine
Will surely shine you'll see
And guide us to where we ought to be
You and me

The moon is coming up
And I'm still here in prayer
You say you've had enough
And that you just don't care

CHORUS

But while the stars are coming out
And light shines from above
You tell me in my dreams
That you believe in love

CHORUS

The sun is coming up
A rainbow on my window
You say you're going away
And even though you do

The power of love divine
Will surely shine you'll see
And guide you home again to be...
You and me

said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy 
waiting for ye.
Tis a rhyme for your lips 
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Look to the Rainbow
Harpers Bizarre,"All you preachers
Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.
It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;
Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practice,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go

[Chorus]
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day!
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way !
I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day.

Ev'ry new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.
In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;
Let me give you advice.

I could blossom out I know,

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

And candle lights on little corner tables

And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin

But I've heard it all before
Now I'm needing something more
A promise is no good if you can't keep it

If heartaches and tears and shadows of doubt
Are part of the deal, you can count me out
But if you're talking about a game I can win
You can count me in

Harry Arnold,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland
Harry Arnold,"The midnight sun will never set
It shines forever in my heart
For it was underneath that amber glow
You whispered low
""We'll never part""
The midnight sun will never set
So now could our romance be through?
For in the ever-shining daylight of our summer love
The midnight sun was shining too
No more is night a wild delight
With all the world on fire
And yet I can't escape
The lips I still desire
I see two silent silhouettes
Against a flaming sky and sea
And then I know, though I'm a fool to care
Again, somewhere
The midnight sun will shine for me",The Midnight Sun Will Never Set
Harry Arnold,"The moon is the same moon above you
Aglow with its cool evening light
But shining at night in Tunisia
Never does it shine so bright.
The stars are aglow in the heavens
But only the wise understand
That shining at night in Tunisia
They guide you through the desert sand.
Words fail to tell a tale
Too exotic to be told
Each night's a deeper night
In a world ages old.

Aglow with its cool evening light
But shining at night in Tunisia
Never does it shine so bright",A Night in Tunisia
Harry Arnold,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much

Harry Arnold,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Harry Arnold,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Harry Arnold,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now
Harry Arnold,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

An airline ticket to romantic places

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

And the scarlet moon starts its gentle rise
The drowsy whale spouts a misty trail
And the stars gather slowly in the skies

These are the times when I know
How alone one can be
And I yearn to go once again
Back to my girl down in Port of Spain

On some distant shore as I walk the sand
And watch the lovers meet
They stand in the moonlight hand in hand
With the surf breaking over their feet

These are the times when I know
How alone one can be
And I yearn to go once again

In Mandalay at a gay cafe
In the wee little hours of morn
When guitars and violins end their play
With a hymn to the goddess of dawn

Harry Belafonte,"Yesterday a child came out to wonder,
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar.
Fearful when the sky is full of thunder,
And tearful at the falling of a star.

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round,
And the painted ponies go up and down.
We're captive on the carousel of time.
We can't return, we can only look behind
From where we came,
And go 'round and 'round and 'round in the circle game. 

Then the child moved ten times round the seasons,
Skated over ten clear frozen streams.
Words like ""when you're older"" must appease him,
And promises of someday make his dreams.

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round,
And the painted ponies go up and down.
We're captive on the carousel of time.
We can't return, we can only look behind
From where we came,
And go 'round and 'round and 'round in the circle game.

Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now,
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town.
And they tell him, ""Take your time, it won't be long now,
'Till you drag your feet to slow the circle down.""

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round,
And the painted ponies go up and down.
We're captive on the carousel of time.
We can't return, we can only look behind
From where we came,
And go 'round and 'round and 'round in the circle game.

So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty,
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true.
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams, and plenty.
Before the last revolving year is through.

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round,
And the painted ponies go up and down.
We're captive on the carousel of time.
We can't return, we can only look behind
From where we came,
And go 'round and 'round and 'round in the circle game.",The Circle Game

He could whistle, he could sing
He went to the mountain early in the mornin'
Just to hear his hammer ring, Lord, Lord
Just to hear his hammer ring.
Just to hear his hammer ring, Lord, Lord
Just to hear his hammer ring.

When John Henry was a little baby,
Sittin' on his daddy's knee
He picked up a hammer, a little piece of steel,
Said hammer be the death of me, Lord, Lord
Said hammer be the death of me
Said hammer be the death of me, Lord, Lord
Said hammer be the death of me

When John Henry's fam'ly needed money,
Said he didn't have but a dime
If you wait 'til the red sun goes down
I'll get it from the man in the mine, Lord, Lord
I'll get it from the man in the mine
I'll get it from the man in the mine, Lord, Lord
I'll get it from the man in the mine

Well John Henry went to the Captain
Said the captain, what can you do
I can hoist a jack, I can lay a track
I can pick and shovel too, Lord, Lord
I can pick and shovel too
I can pick and shovel too, Lord, Lord
I can pick and shovel too

Well the captain said to John Henry,
Gonna bring me a steam drill 'round
Gonna bring me a steam drill out on the job
Gonna whup that steel on down, Lord, Lord
Whup that steel on down

Well John Henry said to the captain,
Oh a man ain't nothin' but a man
'Fore I'd let your steam drill beat me down,
I'd die with my hammer in my hand, Lord, Lord
Die with my hammer in my hand

Well John Henry said to the captain,
Looka yonder what I see,
Hole done choke, drill done broke,
And you can't drive steel like me, Lord, Lord
Can't drive steel like me
Oh no, you can't drive steel like me, no no
Can't drive steel like me

Well John Henry drove into the mountain,
His hammer was strikin' fire
He drove so hard he broke his poor heart
And he laid down his hammer and he died, Lord, Lord
Laid down his hammer and he died
He laid down his hammer and he died, Great God
Laid down his hammer and he died

Oh they took John Henry to the White House
And they buried him in the sand
Every locomotive come roarin' by
Says there lies a steel drivin' man, Lord, Lord
There lies a steel drivin' man
Says there lies a steel drivin' man, Lord, Lord
There lies a steel drivin' man

Shaker why don't you sing,
I'm throwin' twelve pounds from my hips on down,
Just listen to the cold steel ring,
Just listen to the cold steel ring

Well the Captain says to John Henry
I believe this mountains cavin' in
John Henry said to the Captain,
'T ain't nothin' but my hammer suckin' wind,

When I heard my child in prayer
And for me some scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for my hair

All the stores were closed and shuttered
All the streets were dark and bare
In our town, no scarlet ribbons
Not one ribbon for her hair

Through the night my heart was aching
And just before the dawn was breaking
I peeked in and on her bed
In gay profusion lying there
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

If I live to be a hundred
I will never know from where
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons

Harry Belafonte,"When I was a lad just three-foot-three
Certain questions occurred to me
So I asked me father quite seriously
To tell me the story 'bout the bird and bee
He stammered and he stuttered pathetically
And this is what he said to me

He said, the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm
And the famous grandy scratch scratch

It was clear as mud but it covered the ground
And the confusion made the brain go 'round
I went and ask a good friend of mine
Known to the world as Albert Einstein
He said son, from the beginning of time and creativity
There existed the force of relativity
Pi r square and minus ten is routine only when
The solar system in one light year
Make the Hayden planetarium disappear
So if Mt Everest doesn't move
I am positive that it will prove

That the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm
And the famous grandy scratch scratch

The mud it covered the ground
And the confusion made the brain go 'round
I grabbed a boat and I went abroad
And in Baden Germany asked Sigmund Freud
He said son, from your sad face remove the grouch
Put the body up on the couch
I can see from your frustration a neurotic sublimation, hey
Love and hate is psychosomatic
Your Rorschach shows that you're a peri pathetic
It all started with a broken sibling
In the words of the famous Rudyard Kipling

He said the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm
And the famous grandy scratch scratch

Well I traveled far and I traveled wide
And I don't even have me self a bride
All the great men upon this earth
Have confused me since my birth
I've been over land and been over sea
Trying to find answer 'bout the bird and bee
But now that I am ninty three
I don't give a damn you see

If the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass
Hey, the lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm

I met him in a cell in New Orleans
I was down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life
He laughed, slapped his leg a step

He spoke the name Bojangles then he danced a lick
Across the cell
He grabbed his pants, a better stance
Oh he jumped so high, he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around

Mister Bojangles dance

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of fifteen years how his dog and him
Traveled about
His dog up and died, his dog up and died
After twenty years he still grieves

He said I dance now at every chance in Honky tonks
For drinks and tips
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
'Cause I drinks a bit

And as he shook his head
I heard someone ask please

Didn't they try to find some good for you and me
Yes we'll be free
Someday soon it's gonna be one day

Seen my old friend Bobby
Can you tell me, where he's gone?
I thought I saw him walkin' up over the hill
With Abraham, Martin And John
I just looked around and they are gone","Abraham, Martin and John"
Harry Belafonte,"While in that gay tropic isle
I first saw that maiden smile
Though I had failed in the past
I said this is true love at last
But then she whispered to me
That our love never could be

Destiny, oh when will I see the day?
Hopelessly, I've wandered so long this way
This could never be, she said pleadingly
Don't ever love me, I'm just fancy-free
This could never be, she said pleadingly
Don't ever love me
My love was motion and grace
The moonlight soft on her face
I held her close in my arms
My heart was quick to her charms
But then I saw in her glance
It was just an evening's romance

Destiny, oh when will I see the day?
Hopelessly, I've wandered so long this way
This could never be, she said pleadingly
Don't ever love me, I'm just fancy-free
This could never be, she said pleadingly
Don't ever love me

Well the Rock Island Line she runs down into New Orleans
There's a big tollgate down there and you know
If you got certain things on board when you go through the tollgate
Well you don't have to pay the man no toll
Well a train driver he pulled up to the tollgate
And a man hollered and asked him what all he had on board and said
I got livestock I got livestock I got cows I got pigs I got sheep
I got mules I got all livestock
Well he said you're all right boy you don't have to pay no toll
You can just go right on through so he went on through the toolgate
And as he went through he started pickin' up a little bit of speed
Pickin' up a little bit of steam
He got on through he turned and looked back at the man he said

Harry Belafonte,"I think of Andy in the cold wet clay
Those three are on my mind
With his comrades down beside him
On that brutal day
Those three are on my mind

There lies young James in his final pain
Those three are on my mind
So I ask the killers, ""Can you see those three again?
Those three are on my mind""

I see dark eyed Michael
With his dark eyed bride
Those three are on my mind
And three proud mothers
Weeping side by side
Those three are on my mind

But I'm grieving yet
And for some the sky is bright
I cannot give up hoping
For a morning light
So I ask the killers, ""Do you sleep at night?
Oh, those three are on my mind""

I see tin roof shanties
Where my brothers live
Those three are on my mind
And the little burnt out churches
Where they sing we forgive
Those three are on my mind

I know of Tom paints water tree
I know the price of liberty
Now I ask the question that is deep inside of me
Did they also burn the Courthouse
When they killed those three
Those three are on my mind

Those three are on my mind
Those three are on my mind

There was the Ox, the Camel and the Kangaroo
Hallowed in the monkey and the crocodile
He even made the animals they couldn't smile
Packed them in the ark so tight
The Owl couldn't get no sleep at night
Called in Japheth and Shem and Ham

Raised his hand to heaven on high

Shook the mountains and disturbed the sea
Hitched his reins to his Chariot Wheel
Stepped on land and stood out on shore

Creep through my fingers and the moon is bright
Beams of blue come flickering through my window pane
Like gypsy moths that dance around a candle flame

That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would

Moonlight used to bathe the contours of your face
While chestnut hair fell all around the pillow case
The fragrance of your body rests beneath my head
A sympathy bouquet left with the love that's dead

And I wonder if you know
That I never understood
That although you said you'd go
Until you did I never thought you would

Never thought the words you said were true
Never thought you said just what you meant
Never knew how much I needed you
Never thought you'd leave until you went

Morning comes and morning goes with no regret
And evening brings the memories I can't forget
Empty rooms that echo as I climb the stairs
And empty clothes that drape and fall on empty chairs

And I wonder if you know
That I never understood

Until you did I never thought you would

Harry Belafonte,"It's as dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

I never will forget one time when I was on a little visit down home in Ebenezer, Kentucky. 
I was a-talkin' to an old man that had known me ever since the day I was born, and an old friend 
of the family. He says, ""Son, you don't know how lucky you are to have a nice job like you've got 
and don't have to dig out a livin' from under these old hills and hollers like me and your pappy 
used to."" When I asked him why he never had left and tried some other kind of work, he says, 
""Nawsir, you just won't do that. If ever you get this old coal dust in your blood, you're just 
gonna be a plain old coal miner as long as you live."" He went on to say, ""It's a habit 
sorta like chewin' tobaccer."" 

Come and listen you fellows, so young and so fine,
And seek not your fortune in the dark, dreary mines. 
It will form as a habit and seep in your soul, 
'Till the stream of your blood is as black as the coal. 

It's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew, 
Where danger is double and pleasures are few, 
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.
It's a-many a man I have seen in my day, 
Who lived just to labor his whole life away. 
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard his wine, 
A man will have lust for the lure of the mines. 

I hope when I'm gone and the ages shall roll, 
My body will blacken and turn into coal. 
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home, 
And pity the miner a-diggin' my bones.",Dark as a Dungeon

Harry Belafonte,"Suzanne takes you down to her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night forever
And you know that she's half crazy
And that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That came all the way from China
And just when you want to tell her
That you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength
And lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe trust her
'Cause she's touched your perfect body with her mind

And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From a lonely wooden tower
And when He knew for certain
Only drowning men could se Him
He said ""All men shall be sailors,
Then, until the sea shall free them""
But He Himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken almost human,
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with Him
And you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe trust Him
For He's touched your perfect body with His mind

Suzanne takes you down to her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night forever
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look
A mid the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way for ever
While Suzanne holds her mirror

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe trust her
'Cause you've touched her perfect body with your mind",Suzanne

Harry Belafonte,"I say let us put man and a woman together
To find out which one is smarter
Some say man but I say no

And not me but the people they say
That de man are leading de women astray
But I say, that the women of today
Smartre than the man in every way
That's right de woman is uh smarter
That's right de woman is uh smarter
That's right de woman is uh smarter, that's right, that's right

Samson was the strongest man long ago
No one could a beat him, as we all know
Until he clash with Deliah on top of the bed
She told them all the strength was in the hair of his head

You meet a girl at a pretty dance
Thinking that you would stand a chance
Take her home, thinking she's alone
Open de door you find her husband home

I was treating a girl independently
She was making baby for me
When de baby born and I went to see
Eyes was blue it was not by me

Garden of Eden was very nice
Adam never work in Paradise
Eve meet snake, Paradise gone
She make Adam work from that day on

Methuselah spent all his life in tears
Lived without a woman for 900 years
One day he decided to have some fun
The poor man never lived to see 900 and one

All my days I will sing in praise

Cutting cane for her family
I see man at the waterside
Casting nets at the surging tide

Never let me miss carnival

Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree

But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me

Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri

The color is of midnight in this room.
The cars outside are coughing and it's kind of hard to sleep
and there's neon out the window, not the moon.

And it was just an any old kind of day,
The kind that comes and slips away,
The kind that fills up easy my life's time.
The night brought any old kind of dark,
I heard the ticking of my heart.
Then why'm I thinking somethings left behind?

I whistled round today and I skipped off a footloose jig
to the hurdy gurdy music of the street.
I looked past those rooftops and I saw the cloudless sky,
But I keep on asking why my life is passing by,
And I'm left up high and dry,
But it ain't no good to cry,
So I shrug my useless sigh,
And I trust to things that other days will meet.

And it was just an any old kind of day,
The kind that comes and slips away,
The kind that fills up easy my life's time.
The night brought any old kind of dark,

The night has had it's laughing,
when the street lights blind the stars,
So now it's shedding rain to sing it's sorrow,
It's time for me to sleep and to rest these thoughts away,
There's gonna be another day, hey!
when things will go my way,
And there's other things to say,
And there's other songs to play,
And there'll be time enough for thinking come tomorrow.

Harry Chapin,"Could you put your light on please
It's kind of dark tonight
And I feel a little lonely
Yes, I need a little light

Could you put your light on please
Let me hear a friendly sound
I could make it through 'til morning
If you could let your light shine down

She moved so well
'Cause she was a dancer
She went sliding through my questions
Gliding 'round the answer

Whatever it was, she knew it was holy
And each time I tried to hold her
Her smile came sad and slowly
She said, ""No one knows me""

Could you put your light on please
It's kind of dark tonight
And I feel a little lonely
Yes, I need a little light

Could you put your light on please
Let me hear a friendly sound
I could make it through 'til morning

She had a dream
I had my typewriter
While I was hacking out such a heavy world
She was weaving one much lighter

But I'll never know
Just how much it cost her
But each time I slept beside her something turned and tossed her
And it did till I lost her

Bright times were brighter
Than they'd ever been before, I tell you
Night times were lighter
But they'll never, never be no more

Could you put your light on please
It's kind of dark tonight
And I feel a little lonely
Yes, I need a little light

Could you put your light on please
Let me hear a friendly sound

Harry Chapin,"Up in Massachusetts There's a little spit of land.
The men who make the maps, yes, they call the place Cape Ann.
The men who do the fishing call it Gloucester Harbor Sound,
But the women left behind, they call the place Dogtown.

The men go out for whaling, past the breakers and the fogs.
The women stay home waiting they're protected by the dogs.
A tough old whaler woman who had seen three husbands drown,
Polled the population and she named the place Dogtown.

There's all these grey faced women in their black widow's gowns,
Living in this grave yard granite town.
Yeah, you soon learn there's many more than one way to drown;
That's while going to the dogs here in Dogtown.

And she speaks: My father was a merchant all in the Boston fief.
When my husband came and asked him for my hand.
But little did I know then that a Gloucester whaler's wife
Marries but the sea salt and the sand.

He took me up to Dogtown the day I was a bride.
We had ten days together before he left my side.
He's the first mate of a whaling ship,
The keeper of the log.
He said, ""Farewell, my darling, I'm going to leave you with my dog.""

And I have seen the splintered timbers of a hundred shattered hulls,
Known the silence of the granite and the screeching of the gulls,
I've heard that crazy widow Cather walk the harbor as she raves
At the endless rolling whisper of the waves.

Sitting by the fireside, the embers slowly die.
Is it a sign of weakness when a woman wants to cry?
The dog is closely watching the fire glints in his eye.
No use to go to sleep this early, no use to even try.

My blood beats like a woman's,
I've got a woman's breast and thighs.
But where am I to offer them
To the ocean or the skies?

Living with this silent dog
All the moments of my life,
He has been my only husband;
Am I a widow, or his wife?

Yes, it's a Dogtown and it's a fog town,
And there's nothing around 'cept the sea pounding granite ground
And this black midnight horror of a hound.

I'm standing on this craggy cliff,
My eyes fixed on the sea.
Six months past, when his ship was due,
I'm a widow to be.
For liking this half living with the lonely and the fog,
You need the bastard of the mating of a woman and a dog.

And I have seen the splintered timbers of a hundred shattered hulls,
Known the silence of the granite and the screeching of the gulls,
I've heard that crazy widow Cather walk the harbor as she raves
At the endless rolling whisper of the waves.
At the endless rolling whisper of the waves.
At the endless rolling whisper of the waves.",Dogtown

All I want is you and one more tomorrow.
Nothing lasts to long, When I leave it's gone.

Later on the bus arrives.

I find a seat
And we move out past the lights.

It's cold out in the night.
I keep telling to myself that I don't care.
Come tomorrow, I'll be there.

Take the Greyhound.
It's a dog of a way to get around.
Take the Greyhound.
It's a dog gone easy way to get you down.

So I look across the aisle.
The window's frosted, I can't sleep
But the girl returns my smile.
She reminds me of someone I knew back home.
So I doze. So it goes.

My coffee's tasting tired.
My eyes roll over dead.
Got to go outside and get the gas out of my head.
Oh, to be in bed.
You got me driving.
I'm on your Greyhound bus and you're driving.

But there's nothing new about Greyhounds.
Nothing new about feeling down.
Nothing new about putting off
Or putting myself on.

Looking to tomorrow is the way the loser hides
I should have realized by now that all my life's a ride.
It's time to find some happy times and make myself some friends
I know there ain't no rainbows waiting when this journey ends.

Here between the takes at the studio

I've been hunting for you
I'm still wanting you
I need to find you

Of the lonely songs
You long since left behind you

Since you've gone I've gone along
Been writing the music I've always wanted to
And they just picked up on me

I'm putting myself here inside each song
And finding my music is still so full of you
I dreamed of being here but I never dreamed that you
Would be so long time gone from me

Of the lonely songs
You long since left behind you
When I'm still I'm still wanting you

",Same Sad Singer
Harry Chapin,"Well, I've sung out one more evening,
And I'm wrung out, feeling beat.
I walk on out the door once more
To an empty city street.
A Good guitar will serve you well
When you're living in the lights
But it's never going to warm you
In the middle of the night.
And so I come and go with her in whispers.
Each and every time she says she dies.
When she is reborn again
I kiss her.
And the baby never cries.
She works in the daytime,
She leave her baby with a friend.
I sing every evening,
I only see her now and then.
I come to her at midnight,
When 'bout half the world's asleep,
And she puts me back together,
In the hours before I leave.
Her apartment is down on Perry Street,
There's a tree in her backyard.
Her old man had left her,
He just took off for the coast,
And I caught her on the rebound
When I needed her the most.",And the Baby Never Cries
Harry Chapin,"She was crazy (she was beautiful),
I guess she had to be.
I was angry (you were blind),
Because I could not see.
I saw only what her cigarettes had done to her skin.
I should have known the outside world
Would reveal what was within.
She was burning herself,
And her hair was filled with ashes.
She was burning herself,
And her life becomes a flame.
She was burning herself,
And the flame became her passion.
She was burning herself,
And her passion,
Her passion was her pain.
She was trusting (you could have saved her too),
All hope had passed for her.
I was lusting (and she gave to you),
That's all I asked for her.
The marks upon her body
And the marks upon her mind.
I could have erased them
If I'd only taken the time.
I never saw her do it,
I only saw the scars.
I never could imagine
What would make her go that far.
I wondered,
Was she driven by desperate need to feel,
To find out she was living,
To discover life was real.
Or was it that the pain
Slicing through her like a knife
Was easier to take
Than the emptiness of life?
Had a strange sense of drama
Caught her in a role,
Or was she trying to cauterize
The chancres on her sole?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know",Burning Herself
Harry Chapin,"Dripping streetlights
Darkened buildings
Wandering
Head hung down low.
Where will she go?

Woman child, your eyes are wild.
The rain runs down your hair.
Woman child, mercy mild.
What will you tell your teddy bear?

I turned you on my solid body
My electric Gibson guitar.
My clever fingers searched
And found exactly where you are.
You went too far.

I was an early morning phone call.
What news have I received.
A halting voice is telling me,
What we have both conceived,
Asking how the dilemma,
How can it be relieved?

""I will give you money, Honey.
I will set up a time.
But you got to go there on your own babe,
'cause I don't know that it's mine.""

Oh woman child
Mama's little angel's been defiled.
Took a taxi to the clinic
Where they do the modern thing.
The white coat doctor
Laid her out said

""You won't feel a thing.
You get the sweet salvation
That little old knife can bring.
You don't have to worry 'bout no offspring.
That's that.
Go Home and take a nap.
It's just a two hundred dollar mishap.
It don't mean a thing.
It's all over now
You can tell your singer to sing.""",Woman Child
Harry Chapin,"I was cramped into a coffee house pew
Two dollar Coke in my hand
Listening to the music run
Through and out of a drowning man.
Ten years ago I first heard him singing
To a screaming crazy crowd
Now there's thirteen loyal people
Trying to sound that loud.
And I wonder as I watch him now
Why his songs don't turn me on.
He got me into music
Where has the fragile magic gone?
And all the changes
Keep on changing
And the good old days
They say they're gone.
Only wise men
And some new born fools
Say they know what's going on.
But I sometimes think the difference is
Just in how I think and see
And the only changes going on
Are going on in me.
There was you and Fifth avenue
Before there were lies
And all my hot blood schemes
And teenage dreams
Flashed before my eyes.
I did not think I had a chance
You had to prove me wrong
It took a year and a half
Of tears and laughs
Before you moved along.
And now these long years later
When I see you once again
I wonder what you saw in me
When you loved me way back then.
There I was in you Air Force
Uncle Sam, you owned my brain.
I tried to see myself as a sex mad savior
Sailing on a silver plane.
I started out to do my duty
Ended up just doing time.
What is it about you
My mother of a country
That makes so many change our minds.
You had me on your honor roll
For your dream I would die
Now I would not even cross the street
To help you live a lie.",Changes
Harry Chapin,"At first I did not think it could be you.
But you're the only one that got off the train.
So you must be my wife Miss Annie Halsey
Yes, I guess I am your husband, Hello I'm Harry Crane.
Mail Order Annie, never mind your crying.
Your tears are sweet rain in my empty life.
Mail Order Annie, can't you see I'm trying
To tell you that I'm glad you're here,
You are the woman who's come to be my wife.
You know you're not as pretty as I dreamed you'd be,
But then I'm not no handsome fancy Dan.
And out here looks are really not important.
It's what's inside a woman when she's up against the land.
Mail Order Annie, never mind your crying.
Your tears are sweet rain in my empty life.
Mail Order Annie, can't you see I'm trying
To tell you that I'm glad you're here,
You are the woman who's come to be my wife.
You know it's not no easy life you're entering.
The winter wind comes whistling through the cracks there in the sod.
You know you'll never have too many neighbors.
There's you Girl, and there's me, and there's God.
You know I'm just a dirty man from the North Dakota plains.
You're one girl from the city who's been thrown out on her own.
I'm standing here not sure of what to say to you
'Cepting Mail Order Annie, lets you and me go home. 
Mail Order Annie, never mind your crying.
Your tears are sweet rain in my empty life.
Mail Order Annie, can't you see I'm trying
To tell you that I'm glad you're here,
You are the woman who's come to be my wife.",Mail Order Annie
Harry Chapin,"Of course I picked a rainy night
To try to find our past
The street lights all were flickering
The leaves were falling fast

I walked down the winding road
Looked up through the trees
And I saw the corner window 
That you once shared with me

It was Old College Avenue
And in the time of having you
I remember it as if it were today
The tiny room and the single bed

Though the tangled trails of time 
Have led us far astray
The membrance seems to stay
And through all the roads

That led me on 
And through all the years
That you've been gone
I have found that it would never go away

It was Old College Avenue
And in the time of having you
I remember it as if it were today
That fall turned into winter

The winter into spring
And all the while, you led me through
The sweet awakening
But summer never came that year

It's what you went to find
And you took my future with you
And you left your past behind
It was Old College Avenue

And in the time of having you
I remember it as if it were today
The tiny room and the single bed
Though the tangled trails of time

Have led us far astray
The membrance seems to stay
And through all the roads
That led me on

And through all the years
That you've been gone
I have found that it would never go away
It was Old College Avenue

And in the time of having you
I remember it as if it were today
I remember you
As if

It were
Today",Old College Avenue
Harry Chapin,"Have you ever been up
Have you ever been down
Have you ever been lost
Have you ever been found

Have you ever been right
Have you ever been wrong
Have you come up short
Can you come along

Have you left a mark
Have you left alone
Have you seen the way
Can you come back home

Short stories
Babe just take what they will give
Short stories
That's all it's ever been

Don't you worry 'bout the ending
Babe, before we begin
I have seen the sun
That's behind the rain

I have felt the joy
That's behind the pain
Did you ever go soft
Did you ever run wild

I've been a hundred years old
I been a newborn child
I have found a smile in the midst of tears
I can find a heart in the midst of fear

Don't you know I need you near me
Or my happy ending's gone
And I see now so very clearly
That our story must go on
And on!

If I give myself
Can I ask for you
If I give you hope
Can we make it through

You know I need a dream
Like I need my breath
We need to take the life
Before we get the death

You know I need your love
Like I need the light
Yes I need the chance
Can it be tonight?",Short Stories
Harry Chapin,"It's a song for myself
just a song for myself
You don't have to listen babe
it's just a song for myself
But since I fell in love with you
it's brought some thoughts to mind
if we're gonna raise us a couple of kids
I've got to worry 'bout future times
Do I believe that the answer
is still blowing in the iwnd?
I don't believe it!
Do i belive that there are good times rolling
babe, just around the bend?
I don't belive it.
Do I believe that with a little more love
babe, all our troubles end?
Here I am trying to belive in myself
And be a little good
be a little good
be a little good to my friends
It's just a thought that was in my mind
just a thought that was in my mind
But no one's wrote a protest song
since nineteen sixty three
Are we all gonna listen to the moldy gold
and say just let it be?
It's just a song for myself
just a song for myself
You don't have to sing it babe
it's just a song for myself
But it seems our generation
should have something more to say
Are we all gonna sit here
with a stoned out smile
and simply watch the world go 'way?",Song for Myself
Harry Chapin,"There's a lot of lonely people tonight
Trying to make it through 'til the morning light
There's me and you, babe, that's alright
There's a lot of lonely people tonight

I'm holdin' on tight to my pillow
I wish it had a life of its own
Starin' at the ceilin,' such a funny feelin'
But nobody home

But I know you're out there somewhere
That you feel the same way too
Now my only problem is trying to find
A way of getting through to you

There's a lot of lonely people tonight
Trying to make it through 'til the morning light
There's me and you, babe, that's alright
There's a lot of lonely people tonight

I guess we share the same old dream
Or maybe it's the same old lie
There's only one thing I'm sure of, now
And that's our time keeps rolling by

And far too many days run out
And nights begin this way
With my half of our hopeful couple
Trying to hold the dark at bay

There's a lot of lonely people tonight
Trying to make it through 'til the morning light
There's me and you, babe, that's alright
There's a lot of lonely people tonight

You can meet me on a city street
Or meet me by a country stream
You can meet me on a mountain top, babe
But don't you meet me in my dreams

You can meet me tomorrow morning
Baby, maybe you met me back when
You can meet me now inside this song
Cause I don't wanna sleep alone again

There's a lot of lonely people tonight
Trying to make it through 'til the morning light
There's me and you, babe, that's alright
Cause there's a lot of lonely people

So many lonely people
There's a lot of lonely people all over the world
We even lay with children and beautiful girls
Yes, there's me and you, babe, but that's alright
Cause there's a lot of lonely people tonight",There's a Lot of Lonely People Tonight
Harry Chapin,"It was just another night
And I was out on a limb
Looking for someone
To help me back in.
A couple of hours of cruising around
Brought me into a bar
And I sat me down
Nothing much to be found.
So I got in to talking to the old bar man
He said:
""You got a problem I can understand
And I know a little lady
Who is all alone.
If you find her she will take you home.
She don't like to spend her nights alone!""
They call her Easy.
They say it's not a way for a body to be.
They call her Easy.
She is giving out her love for free.
I found her on the street
Like the bartender said.
She was not great looking
But not that bad.
Walked on up to her
And didn't say a word
But my eyes were talking
And I think she heard.
Yes, she heard me.
We walked down the road
To a rundown farm.
She lit a couple of candles
And she held out her arms.
Lord, she was gentle as a windblown sigh
In the morning while dressing I could hear her cry.
She was crying and I went flying out of there.
The next day found me walking in ton.
Saw the old bartender and I flagged him down.
I thanked him for the girl
And told him that she pleased me
And laughed a little bit
About how she was easy.
But the old man stopped me
With the look in his eye.
He said,
""You know I had hoped
You weren't that kind of guy.
Dream of the kind of world it could be
If we were with our loves like Easy""
It's a hard world we must learn to be easy.
In a cold world I must love the ones who please me
Easy!",They Call Her Easy
Harry Chapin,"There's no tick tock on your electric clock
But still your life runs down.

There's no tick tock on your electric clock
But still your life runs down.

I'm halfway to heaven and my home in Forest Hills
It's half past eleven and I've got some time to kill.
I missed my bus connection my train got in too late
And I'm forced into reflection by this half hour wait.

Now I have been a straight man and I've played it by the rules
I been a good man, a good husband, a good old fashioned fool.
I have a fine wife and two children just like everybody's got
But after fifteen years of marriage the fires don't burn too hot.

Ahh someone played a trick on me.
They set me up so perfectly
They Gave me their morality
And then changed the rules they set for me.
Someone must be laughing now,
Though it don't seem funny somehow,
How the world's accepting now
What they once would not allow
Back in my younger days.
The world has changed in so many ways.

My mother once said to me so many years ago now
Don't you touch those bad girls, so I never had girls
Until I had my Mary when we married.
My Mary then had my two sons
My life as a lover was already done
It was over before it had really begun.

Ahh someone played a trick on me.
They sent this little girl to me,
She is my new secretary
And she's something to see.
yeah She's a nice girl, but it's a young world
And she lives her life so free, and she sure gets through to me

She brings her pad into my office, she wears a sweater and a skirt
And somewhere deep inside of me something starts to hurt.
She's wearing nothing underneath, and I can see what's there to see
She smiles and says, ""You wanted me?"" I'd have to agree.

You know how much I want her,
And I know that I could have her.
I know I could, I know she would
Make love to me, so wonderfully.
God damn, I'm one crazy mixed up mixture of a man.

In my head all my life I've been a sinner,
And in my bed with just my wife I'm still a beginner,
But tomorrow night I'm taking that little girl out to dinner!

There's no tick tock on your electric clock
But still your life runs down.",Halfway to Heaven
Harry Chapin,"I was thrown on the cobblestones, tossed at her feet
My fool's mouth was filled with the dust from the street
An out of work court jester with nowhere to go
And no need to speak, for she seemed to know

She sings the songs without words
Songs that sailors, and blind men, and beggars have heard
She knows more of love than the poets can say
And her eyes are for something that won't go away

This mad mocking town, and its dishonored guest
Disappeared in the colors that danced on her dress
She led me to safety in a forest of green
And showed my stale eyes some sights never seen

She sings the songs without words
Songs that sailors, and blind men, and beggars have heard
She knows more of love than the poets can say
And her eyes are for something that won't go away

She spins magic and moonlight in her meadows and streams
And seeks deep inside me and touches my dreams
The morning comes smiling and I laugh with no sound
And snuggle in silence and the sweet peace I've found

And she sings the songs without words
Songs that sailors, and blind men, and beggars have heard
She knows more of love than the poets can say
And her eyes are for something that won't go away

No they won't go away
Go away",She Sings Songs Without Words
Harry Chapin,"He was crazy of course 
From the first she must have known it 
But still she went on with him 

And she never once had shown it 
And she took him off the street 
And she dried his tears of grieving 

She listened to his visions 
She believed in his believe-ins 

Oh, he was the sun burning bright and brittle 
And she was the moon shining back his light a little 
He was a shooting star 
She was softer and more slowly 

He could not make things possible 
But, she could make them holy 
He was dancing to some music 
No one else had ever heard 

He'd speak in unknown languages 
She would translate every word 
And then when the world was laughing 
At his castles in the sky 

She'd hold him in her body 
Till he once again could fly 
Oh, he was the sun burning bright and brittle 
And she was the moon shining back his light a little 

He was a shooting star 
She was softer and more slowly 
He could not make things possible 
But, she could make them holy 

Well, she gave him a daughter 
And she gave him a son 
She was a mother, and a wife, 
And a lover when the day was done 

He was too far gone for giving love 
What he offered in its stead 
Was the knowledge she was the only thing 
That was not in his head 

He took off East one morning 
Towards the rising sun's red glow 
She knew he was going nowhere 
But of course she let him go 

And as she stood and watched him dwindle 
Much too empty to be sad 
He reappeared beside her saying, 
""You're all I've ever had"" 

Oh, he was the sun burning bright and brittle 
And she was the moon shining back his light a little 
He was a shooting star 
She was softer and more slowly 

He could not make things possible 
But, she could make them holy

Harry Chapin,"The very day I purchased it
I christened my guitar
As my monophonic symphony
Six string orchestra
In my room I'd practice late
They'd leave me alone
My mother said, ""You're nothing yet
To make the folks write home""

I'd play at all the talent nights
I'd finish, they'd applaud
Some called it muffled laughter
I just figured they were odd
So I went up for an encore
But they screamed they'd had enough
Or maybe I just need a group
To help me do my stuff

And so I'd dream a bass will join me
And fill the bottom in
And maybe now some lead guitar
So it would not sound so thin
I need some drums to set the beat
And help me keep in time
And way back in the distance
Some strings would sound so fine

And we would play together
Like fine musicians should
And it would sound like music
And the music would sound good
But in real life I'm stuck with
That same old formula
Me and my monophonic symphony
Six string orchestra

Oh, I write love songs for my favorite girl
And sing them soft and slow
But before I get to finish
She says she has to go
She's nice and says ""Excuse me
I've got to find a bar
I think I need refreshment
For I hear you play guitar""

Oh I sent a demo tape I made
To the record companies
Two came back address unknown
One came back C.O.D
Of course I got form letters
All saying pleasant things
Like suggesting I should find a trade
Where I would not have to sing

And so I'd dream a bass will join me
And fill the bottom in
And maybe now some lead guitar
So it would not sound so thin
I need some drums to set the beat
And help me keep in time
And way back in the distance
Some strings would sound so fine

And we would play together
Like fine musicians should
And it would sound like music
And the music would sound good
But in real life I'm stuck with
That same old formula
Me and my monophonic symphony
Six string orchestra

I've been taking guitar lessons
But my teacher just took leave
It was something about a break down
Or needing a reprieve
I know I found my future
So I will persevere
And hold onto my dream of
Making music to their ears

And so I'd dream a bass will join me
And fill the bottom in
And maybe now some lead guitar
So it would not sound so thin
I need some drums to set the beat
And help me keep in time
And way back in the distance

Harry Chapin,"Mrs. Smith and Mr. Jones have come to pass the night
They pulled off of the highway when they saw my light
It's a vacancy I offer them, what they offer me
Is fullness for a lifetime that's bare as can be

There's a vacancy, won't you come to me
And fill my empty spaces 
I'm a motel man in a promised land
That's filled with empty faces
So won't you bring your sorrows bring your dreams, 
It's a place for you to be
There's no more tomorrow or that's how it seems
Won't you come to me? I've got a vacancy

Another night, another sight, another bedtime story
Another stage, another chance, for gentleness or violence
Another birth, another dance, another death in silence

Harry Chapin,"When I rearrange the pieces of the puzzle of my past
I sigh at the heartaches, relive the laughs
And I think about the moments that have left their mark
And the too few faces that shine a little light in the dark

If you don't mind I'm gonna tell you a story
And I think that it won't bore you
For it's a tale that I've never told
To anyone before you 'cause it's for you

The sun of sixteen summers had put halos in your hair
If anything was in my head, twelve winters put it there
A dollar an hour is what Mama paid you to come and mind her kids
But no one could really pay you enough for what you really did

Many happy things keep happening
On my journey through this world
And in many ways, that I will never understand
I was much too late
To be the first to make you a woman
But you were the one
Who made my mother's son a man

You know I used to read myself to sleep when I went to bed
I guess I was a dreamer then who lived inside my head
But the nights that you came you talked of things, I found I had a friend
You brought my fears of people to a sure and gentle end

Many happy things keep happening
On my journey through this world
And in many ways, that I will never understand
I was much too late
To be the first to make you a woman
But you were the one
Who made my mother's son a man

Do you remember the night when you turned out the light
And said to me: ""Please hold me""
I did not know which way to go
So I did just what you told me ""Please hold me""

When I think about you now it's not that my memory fails
There's just no need for graphic telling of all the details
Let's just say you taught me something that brought me from my shell
You gave to me that first sweet taste of the heaven here in this hell

Many happy things keep happening
On my journey through this world
And in many ways, that I will never understand

Harry Chapin,"His mama was a midnight woman
His daddy was a drifter drummer
One night they put it together
Nine months later came the little black bummer

He was a laid back lump in the cradle
Chewing the paint chips that fell from the ceiling
Whenever he cried he got a fist in his face
So he learned not to show his feelings

He was a pig-tail puller in grammer school
Left back twice by the seventh grade
Sniffing glue in Junior High
And the first one in school to get laid

He was a weed-speed pusher at fifteen
He was mainlining skag a year later
He'd started pimping when they put him away
In jail he changed from a junkie to a hater

And just like the man from the precinct said:
""Put him away, you better kill him instead.
A bummer like that is better of dead
Someday they're gonna have to put a bullet in his head.""

They threw him back on the street, he robbed an A & P
He didn't blink at the buddy that he shafted
And just about the time they would have caught him too
He had the damn good fortune to get drafted

He was A-One bait for Vietnam, you see they needed more bodies in a hurry
He was a cinch to train cause all they had to do
Was to figure how to funnel his fury

They put him in a tank near the D M Z
To catch the gooks slipping over the border
They said his mission was to Search and Destroy
And for once he followed and order

One sweat-soaked day in the Yung-Po Valley
With the ground still steaming from the rain
There was a bloody little battle that didn't mean nothing
Except to the few that remained

You see a couple hundred slants had trapped the other five tanks
And had started to pick off the crews
When he came on the scene and it really did seem
This is why he'd paid those dues

It was something like a butcher going berserk
Or a sane man acting like a fool
Or the bravest thing that a man had ever done
Or a madman blowing his cool

Well he came on through like a knife through butter
Or a scythe sweeping through the grass
Or to say it like the man would have said it himself:
""Just a big black bastard kicking ass!""

And just like the man from the precinct said:
""Put him away, you better kill him instead.
A bummer like that is better of dead
Someday they're gonna have to put a bullet in his head.""

When it was over and the smoke had cleared
There were a lot of VC bodies in the mud
And when the rescue men came over for the very first time
They found him smiling as he lay in his blood

They picked up the pieces and they stitched him back together
He pulled through though they thought he was a goner
And he forced them to give him what they said they would
Six purple hearts and the Medal of Honor

Of course he slouched as the chief white honkey said:
""Service beyond the call of duty""
But the first soft thought was passing through his mind
""My medal is a Mother of a beauty!""

He got a couple of jobs with the ribbon on his chest
And though he tried he really couldn't do 'em
There was only a couple of things that he was really trained for
And he found himself drifting back to 'em
Just about the time he was ready to break
The V A stopped sending him his checks
Just a matter of time 'cause there wasn't no doubt
About what he was gonna to do next

It ended up one night in a grocery store
Gun in hand and nine cops at the door
And when his last battle was over
He lay crumpled and broken on the floor

And just like the man from the precinct said:
""Put him away, you better kill him instead.
A bummer like that is better of dead
Someday they're gonna have to put a bullet in his head.""

Well he'd breathed his last, but ten minutes past
Before they dared to enter the place
And when they flipped his riddled body over they found
His second smile frozen on his face

They found his gun where he'd thrown it
There was something else clenched in his fist
And when they pried his fingers open they found the Medal of Honor
And the Sergeant said: ""Where in the hell he get this?""

There was a stew about burying him in Arlington
So they shipped him in box to Fayette
And they stashed him in a grave in a county plot
The kind we remember to forget

And just like the man from the precinct said:
""Put him away, you better kill him instead.
A bummer like that is better of dead
Someday they're gonna have to put a bullet in his head.""",Bummer
Harry Chapin,"Now he was a man who worked with his hands
Only in a motor he found peace
He could make an engine sing like a bird
He could find his only lind of release
When he was up to the elbows in the grease.

She dreamed of a time for painting
As she was cleaning up his stains from the rug
She'd play all day with their children
And try to meet him with a welcome and hug
As he came shuffling through the house with a shrug

I tell you dirt gets under the fingernails
And hate gets under the skin
But a dream got a way of getting down to the bone
And the heart of a body that it's in.

While he was making magic with his piston machines
She was cleaning up the mess he'd left behind.
She was trying to make it through to the end of the day
With a little empty time
And do the painting that meant peace of mind.

I tell you dirt gets under the fingernails
And hate gets under the skin
But a dream got a way of getting down to the bone
And the heart of a body that it's in.

Well one day she didn't bother 'bout making his bed.
She hurried all the children out the door.
And she let the bills and the marketing go.
And she went and almost bought out an art supply store.

It just so happened that day he got to thinking.
Of the grease that always covered up his skin.
So he left the garage a little early
He got a shave and a manicure and trim
Came out clean as a plaster maniquin.

He came home in a hurry
But he almost didn't recognize the place.
It looked like it'd been hit by a hurricane.
There was canvas filling every open space.
And she had paint all over her face.

I tell you dirt gets under the fingernails
And hate gets under the skin
But a dream got a way of getting down to the bone
And the heart of a body that it's in.

They both stood stunned into silence
Then their laughter exploded like a shout
And he went out to make some magic in the kitchen
The clean man learning what cooking was about.
And the dirty girl painting her messy heart out.

Harry Chapin,"The rock is gonna fall on us, he woke with a start
And he ran to his mother, the fear dark in his heart
And he told her of the vision that he was sure he'd seen
She said: ""Go back to sleep son, you're having a bad dream!""

Silly child
Everybody knows the rock leans over the town
Everybody knows that it won't tumble to the ground
Remember Chicken Little said the sky was falling down
Well nothing ever came of that, the world still whirls around

""The rock is gonna fall on us,"" he stood and told the class
The professor put his chalk down and peered out through his glasses
But he went on and said; ""I've seen it, high up on the hill
If it doesn't fall this year then very soon it will!""

Crazy boy
Everybody knows the rock leans over the town
Everybody knows that it won't tumble to the ground
We've more important studies than your fantasies and fears

You know that rock's been perched up there for a hundred thousand years
""The rock is gonna fall on us."" He told the magistrates
""I believe that we can stop it but the time is getting late
You see I've done all the research my plans are all complete.""

He was showing them contingencies when they showed him to the street
Just a madman

Everybody knows the rock leans over the town
Everybody knows that it won't tumble to the ground
Everybody knows of those who say the end is near
Everybody knows that life goes on as usual round here

He went up on the mountain beside the giant stone
They knew he was insane so they left him alone
He'd given up enlisting help for there was no one else
He spent his days devising ways to stop the rock himself

One night while he was working building braces on the ledge
The ground began to rumble the rock trembled on the edge
""The rock is gonna fall on us! Run or you'll all be crushed!""
And indeed the rock was moving, crumbling all to dust

He ran under it with one last hope that he could add a prop
And as he disappeared the rock came to a stop
The people ran into the street but by then all was still
The rock seemed where it always was or where it always will be

When someone asked where he had gone they said: ""Oh he was daft.
Who cares about that crazy fool."" And then they'd start to laugh
But high up on the mountain
When the wind is hitting it

If you're watching very closely
The rock slips a little bit",The Rock

Sandy is the summer's day
She laughs inside the brook

I have fused some crystal images from common grains of sand
And if I haven't reached the heavens, I've surely learned to fly
I've been caught up in the soaring and the touching of the sky

But the startripper's coming on back home now
It's a crazy blind man's journey he's been on
The startripper's lost and all alone now
And it's your face he'd like to look upon
Yes, he's praying that you won't be long gone

They put you in a capsule, they send you towards the sun
They carve you into plastic before you orbit's done
And all the scribes and seers they chorus out your name
Though the photographs and headlines change the story stays the same

I thought that I was roaring like the wind
I thought that I had surely reached the end now
But I can't remember anywhere I've been

Was I looking for a star or something else behind it?
Whatever I was looking for, I surely dod not find it
And for all my sky high journeys the only thing I know
Is that you almost always lose yourself when you let yourself go

Harry Chapin,"I'm a tangled up puppet,
Spinning round in knots,
And the more I see what I used to be,
The less of you I've got.

There was a time that you curled up in my lap; like a child
You'd cling to me smiling, yours eyes wide and wild
Now you slip through my arms, wave a passing hello
Twist away and toss a kiss, laughing as you go

You used to say ""Read me a story and sing me songs of love""
For you were Princess Paradise like your wings of a dove
Now I chase you and tease you trying to remake you my own
But you just turn away and say ""please leave me alone.""

And I'm a tangled up puppet
All hanging in your strings
I'm a butterfly in a spider's web
Fluttering my wings

And the more that I keep dancing
And spinning round in knots
The more I see what I used to be
And the less of you I've got

You are a drawer full of makeup and rinses and things
You keep changing your moods like your earrings and rings
But tonight while we played tag for five minutes in the yard
Just for a moment I caught you off guard
But now you write your secret poems
In a room just for your dreams
You don't find time to talk to me
About the things you mean
And what I mean is

I have watched you take shape from a jumble of parts
And find the grace and form of a fine work of art

Harry Chapin,"It was just after dark when the truck started down
The hill that leads into Scranton Pennsylvania.
Carrying thirty thousand pounds of bananas.
Carrying thirty thousand pounds (hit it Big John) of bananas.

He was a young driver,
Just out on his second job.
And he was carrying the next day's pasty fruits
For everyone in that coal-scarred city
Where children play without despair
In backyard slag-piles and folks manage to eat each day
Just about thirty thousand pounds of bananas.
Yes, just about thirty thousand pounds (scream it again, John) .

He passed a sign that he should have seen,
Saying ""shift to low gear, a fifty dollar fine my friend.""
He was thinking perhaps about the warm-breathed woman
Who was waiting at the journey's end.
He started down the two mile drop,
The curving road that wound from the top of the hill.
He was pushing on through the shortening miles that ran down to the depot.
Just a few more miles to go,
Then he'd go home and have her ease his long, cramped day away.
And the smell of thirty thousand pounds of bananas.
Yes the smell of thirty thousand pounds of bananas.

He was picking speed as the city spread its twinkling lights below him.
But he paid no heed as the shivering thoughts of the nights
Delights went through him.
His foot nudged the brakes to slow him down.
But the pedal floored easy without a sound.
He said ""Christ!""
It was funny how he had named the only man who could save him now.
He was trapped inside a dead-end hellslide,
Riding on his fear-hunched back
Was every one of those yellow green
I'm telling you thirty thousand pounds of bananas.
Yes, there were thirty thousand pounds of bananas.

He barely made the sweeping curve that led into the steepest grade.
And he missed the thankful passing bus at ninety miles an hour.
And he said ""God, make it a dream!""
As he rode his last ride down.
And he said ""God, make it a dream!""
As he rode his last ride down.
And he sideswiped nineteen neat parked cars,
Clipped off thirteen telephone poles,
Hit two houses, bruised eight trees,
And Blue-Crossed seven people.
It was then he lost his head,
Not to mention an arm or two before he stopped.
And he slid for four hundred yards
Along the hill that leads into Scranton, Pennsylvania.
All those thirty thousand pounds of bananas.

You know the man who told me about it on the bus,
As it went up the hill out of Scranton, Pennsylvania,
He shrugged his shoulders, he shook his head,
And he said (and this is exactly what he said)
""Boy that sure must've been something.
Just imagine thirty thousand pounds of bananas.
Yes, there were thirty thousand pounds of mashed bananas.
Of bananas. Just bananas. Thirty thousand pounds.
Of Bananas. not no driver now. Just bananas!""

We have no bananas today

From Greatest Stories Live: Ending #2:

A woman walks into her room where her child lies sleeping,
And when she sees his eyes are closed,
She sits there, silently weeping,
And though she lives in Scranton, Pennsylvania
She never ever eats ... Bananas

And the place just opened up.
And the little man come in so fast and
Started at his cup.
And the broad who served the whiskey
She was a big old friendly girl.
And she tried to fight her empty nights
By smilin' at the world.

And she said ""Hey Bub, It's been awhile
Since you been around.
Where the hell you been hidin'?
And why you look so down ?""

But the little man just sat there like he'd never heard a sound.

The waitress she gave out with a cough,
And acting not the least put off,
She spoke once again.

She said, ""I don't want to bother you,
Consider it's understood.
I know I'm not no beauty queen,
But I sure can listen good.""

And the little man took his drink in his hand
And he raised it to his lips.
He took a couple of sips.
And he told the waitress this story.

""I am the midnight watchman down at Miller's Tool and Die.
And I watch the metal rusting, and I watch the time go by.
A week ago at the diner I stopped to get a bite.
And this here lovely lady she sat two seats from my right.
And Lord, Lord, Lord she was alright.

""Well, she was so damned beautiful she could warm a winter's frost.
But she was long past lonely, and well nigh kinda lost.
Now I'm not much of a mover, or a pick-em-up easy guy,
But I decided to glide on over, and give her one good try.
And Lord, Lord, Lord she was worth a try.

""I was Tongued-tied like a school boy, and I stammered out some words.
But it did not seem to matter much, 'cause I don't think she heard.
She just looked clear on through me to a space back in my head.
And it shamed me into silence, as quietly she said,
'If you want me to come with you, then that's all right with me.
Cause I know I'm going nowhere, and anywhere's a better place to be.
Anywhere's a better place to be.'

""I drove her to my boarding house, and I took her up to my room.
And I went to turn on the only light to brighten up the gloom.
But she said, 'Please leave the light off, Oh I don't mind the dark.'
And as her clothes all tumbled 'round her, I could hear my heart.
The moonlight shown upon her as she lay back in my bed.
It was the kind of scene I only had imagined in my head.
I just could not believe it, to think that she was real.
And as I tried to tell her she said 'Shhh.. I know just how you feel.
And if you want to come here with me, then that's all right with me.
'Cause I've been oh so lonely, lovin' someone is a better way to be.
Anywhere's a better way to be.'

""The morning came so swiftly as I held her in my arms.
But she slept like a baby, snug and safe from harm.
I did not want to share her or dare to break the mood,
So before she woke I went out to buy us both some food.

""I came back with my paper bag, to find that she was gone.
She'd left a six word letter saying 'It's time that I moved on.'""

The waitress took her bar rag, and she wiped it across her eyes.
And as she spoke her voice came out as something like a sigh.
She said ""I wish that I was beautiful, or that you were halfway blind.
And I wish I weren't so god-damned fat, I wish that you were mine.
And I wish that you'd come with me, when I leave for home.
For we both know all about loneliness, and livin' all alone.""

And the little man,
Looked at the empty glass in his hand.
And he smiled a crooked grin,
He said, "" I guess I'm out of gin.
And know we both have been so lonely.
And if you want me to come with you, then that's all right with me.
'Cause I know I'm goin' nowhere and anywhere's a better place to be.""",A Better Place to Be

Sunrise and sundown;
Moon rolls through the nighttime;
'Til the daybreak comes around.

All my life's a circle;
But I can't tell you why;
Season's spinning round again;
The years keep rollin' by.

It seems like I've been here before;
I can't remember when;
But I have this funny feeling;
That we'll all be together again.
No straight lines make up my life;
And all my roads have bends;
There's no clear-cut beginnings;
And so far no dead-ends.

I found you a thousand times;
I guess you done the same;
But then we lose each other;

Let's go 'round one more time.

Harry Chapin,"There you stand in your dungarees
Looking all grown up and so very pleased
When you write your poems they have so much to say
When you speak your dreams it takes my breath away

You know I want to be a ball player
A regular slugging fool
But I guess our dreams must wait awhile
Until we finish school

And so you and I
We watch our years go by
We watch our sweet dreams fly
Far away, but maybe someday

I don't know when
But we will dream again
And we'll be happy then
'Til our time just drifts away

There you stand in your wedding dress
You're so beautiful that I must confess
I'm so proud you have chosen me
When a doctor is what you want to be

You know I want to be a painter, girl
A real artistic snob
But I guess we'll have our children first
You'll find a home, I'll get a job

Listen to the seasons passing
Listen to the wind blow
Listen to the children laughing
Where do broken dreams go?

There you stand in your tailored suit
So many years gone by, but you're still so cute
You take the car to go and meet the bus
When our grandchildren come to visit us

You say you should have been a ballerina, babe
There are songs I should have sung
But I guess our dreams have come and gone
You're 'sposed dream when you are young

And so you and I
We'll watch our years go by
We'll watch our sweet dreams fly
Far away, but maybe someday

I don't know when
But we will dream again
And we'll be happy then

Harry Chapin,"I come fresh from the street
Fast on my feet, kinda lean and lazy
Not much meat on my bones, and a whole lot alone
And more than a little bit crazy
The old six string was all I had
To keep my belly still
And for each full-hour lesson I gave
I got a crisp ten dollar bill

She was married for seven years
To a concrete castle king
She said she wanted to learn to play the guitar
And to hear her children sing
So I'd show up about once a week
In my faded tight-legged jeans
With a backlog full of hobo stories
And dilapidated dreams

[Chorus]
She said, ""I want to learn a love song full of happy things.""
She said, ""I want to learn a love song; won't you let me hear you sing?""
She said, ""I want to learn a love song, I want to hear you play.""
She said, ""I want to learn a love song before you go away.""

So I tried to teach her a couple of chords
And an easy melody
But it always turned out she'd rather listen
To my guitar and me
I could hear her old man laughing in the den
Playing stud poker with the boys
While I sang so soft in the living room
Too scared to make much noise
I came one week and the den was dark
And she met me at the door
And we sat on the couch and we sang and talked
Till I could not sing no more
The silence kept on building
Her eyes grew much too wide
And I could hear both of our heartbeats
But there was no place to hide

[Chorus]

Well, I guess you know what happened
God, I never been so clean
Yes, I feel like I'm working in a Hollywood movie
Or living out a good bad dream
And all them pinup girls in that tinsel world
Never touched me like she can
It took another man's wife in the real world life
To make this boy a man

I guess you know I stayed",I Wanna Learn a Love Song
Harry Chapin,"Mister Tanner was a cleaner from a town in the Midwest.
And of all the cleaning shops around he'd made his the best.
But he also was a baritone who sang while hanging clothes.
He practiced scales while pressing tails and sang at local shows.
His friends and neighbors praised the voice that poured out from his throat.
They said that he should use his gift instead of cleaning coats.

But music was his life, it was not his livelihood,
And it made him feel so happy and it made him feel so good.
And he sang from his heart and he sang from his soul.
He did not know how well he sang; It just made him whole.

His friends kept working on him to try music out full time.
A big debut and rave reviews, a great career to climb.
Finally they got to him, he would take the fling.
A concert agent in New York agreed to have him sing.
And there were plane tickets, phone calls, money spent to rent the hall.
It took most of his savings but he gladly used them all.

But music was his life, it was not his livelihood,
And it made him feel so happy and it made him feel so good.
And he sang from his heart and he sang from his soul.
He did not know how well he sang; It just made him whole.

The evening came, he took the stage, his face set in a smile.
And in the half filled hall the critics sat watching on the aisle.
But the concert was a blur to him, spatters of applause.
He did not know how well he sang, he only heard the flaws.
But the critics were concise, it only took four lines.
But no one could accuse them of being over kind.

Mr. Martin Tanner, Baritone, of Dayton, Ohio made his
Town Hall debut last night. He came well prepared, but unfortunately
His presentation was not up to contemporary professional standards.
His voice lacks the range of tonal color necessary to make it
Consistently interesting.

Full time consideration of another endeavor might be in order.
He came home to Dayton and was questioned by his friends.
Then he smiled and just said nothing and he never sang again,
Excepting very late at night when the shop was dark and closed.
He sang softly to himself as he sorted through the clothes.

Music was his life, it was not his livelihood,
And it made him feel so happy and it made him feel so good.
And he sang from his heart and he sang from his soul.
He did not know how well he sang; It just made him whole.",Mr. Tanner
Harry Chapin,"I am born today
The Sun burns a promise
In my eye

Mama strikes me
And I draw a breath and cry
Above me a cloud
Slowly tumbles through the sky
I am glad, to be alive

It is my seventh day
I taste the hunger
And I cry

My Brother and sister
Cling to Mama's side
She squeezes her breast
But it has nothing to provide
Someone weeps, I fall asleep

It is twenty days today
Mama does not hold me
Anymore

I open my mouth
But I am to weak to cry
Above me a bird slowly crawls across the sky
Why is there nothing
Now to do but die?",The Shortest Story
Harry Chapin,"Hello Honey, it's me
What did you think when you heard me back on the radio?
What did the kids say when they knew it was their long lost daddy-o?
Remember how we listened to the radio
And I said ""That's the place to be""
And how I got the job as an FM Jock the day you married me?
It was two kids and I was was into AM rock
But I just had to run around
It's been ages since I left you babe
Let me tell you 'bout what's gone down

[Chorus]
I am the morning DJ at W*O*L*D
Playing all the hits for you wherever you may be
The bright good-morning voice who's heard but never seen
Feeling all of forty-five going on fifteen

The drinking I did on my last big gig, it made my voice go low
They said that they liked the young sound when they let me go
So I drifted on down to Tulsa, Oklahoma to do me a late night talk show
Now I worked my way down home again, here to Boise, Idaho
That's how this business goes

[Chorus]

I been making extra money doing high school sock hops
I'm a big time guest MC
You should hear me talking to the little children
And listen what they say to me
Got a spot on the top of my head, just begging for a new toupee
And a tire around my gut from sitting on my butt
But it's never gonna go away

Sometimes I get this crazy dream
That I just take off in my car
But you can travel on ten thousand miles and still stay where you are
I've been thinking that I should stop disk jockeying
And start that record store
Maybe I could settle down if you'd take me back once more

OK Honey, I see
I guess he's better than me
Sure, Girl, I understand
You don't have to worry; I'm such a happy man

W*O*L*D, W*O*L*D, W*O*L*D, W*O*L*D, W*O*L*D*

I am the morning DJ at K*A*H*J
Playing all the hits for you, playing 'em night and day
The bright good morning voice who's heard but never seen

Harry Chapin,"Caroline
Comes from the rain
Glistening and shivering
She laughs as she shakes off the weather
Caroline
Whispers her words
Saying she'll always love me
At least when we are together
Caroline
Starts closing in
Surrounding the spot
Where watching in wonder I stand
Caroline
She's shedding her rings
Her bracelets and stockings
And placing her skin still moist in the palm of my hand

You're pressing she smiles
It's too soon to ask
For me to cast off my cover
You assume that I'm caught
Up there in your head
So now I must go to my lover.

Her world is such a sudden place
A minute flashed before my face
To fly to feel to fall from grace
Oh Caroline I'm leaning, careening

This bubble that I choose to chase
Keeps breaking on the brink of space
Just as I'm about to taste
It's meaning Caroline

Caroline
Comes from the full moon
Trembling and grieving
Afraid of the march of the seasons
Caroline
You're too young to be running
Too old to be lying
Too wise not to see all the reasons
Caroline
Hangs her cape and her jeans
And surrenders her tears
To christen my pillow with sorrow
Caroline
She remains after times
To explain what she means, she speaks of today
More than she dreams of tomorrow

She says Never has life
Been so full of the urge
To let go of the night and believe
She collects all her things
While she's still of a mind
So soft it's like breathing she leaves.",Caroline
Harry Chapin,"Old John Joseph was a man with two first names
They left him in the railroad yard when they took away the trains
Only one run a week comes on roaring down that line
So all he's got to worry 'bout is time.

I come by in the evening to hear 'bout where he's been
He says come on sit down Kid, where shall I begin?
He starts telling me the stories of the glories of his past
But he always saves the story of his Corey for the last.

And he says my Corey's coming. No more sad stories coming
My midnight-moonlight-morning-glory's coming aren't you girl?
And like I told you, when she holds you
She enfolds you in her world.

I was quite surprised to find out all the places that he knew
And so I asked the townfolk if his stories were true
They said old John was born here, he's lived here all his life
He's never had a woman, let alone a wife.

And very soon you'll find out as you check around
That no one named Corey's ever lived in this town
So I chided the old man 'bout the truth that I had heard
He smiled and said reality is only just a word.

I came by one evening but he did not hear my shout
I looked in the window and saw the fire was out
When he would not wake up I forced in the door
And found that Old John Joseph would tell stories no more.

The scene at the graveyard, three of us were there
Me and the gravedigger heard the parson's prayer
He said - We need not grieve for this man,
For we know that God cares!

They put the cold dirt over him and left me on my own
And when at last I looked up I saw I was not alone
So I said if you're a relative, he had a peaceful end.
She said my name is Corey you can say I'm just a friend.

Corey's coming, no more sad stories coming
My midnight-moonlight-morning-glory's coming aren't you girl?
And like I told you, when she holds you
She enfolds you in her world.

So that's the old man's story, I'm glad you came tonight
A busted down old railroad yard sure makes a lonely sight
You may wonder why a young man would work out here alone
Well the job pays enough to keep some flesh on my bones.

And I confess I get to missing the old man a bit
And there's one other reason I guess I should admit 

Can't you see my Corey's coming, no more sad stories coming
My midnight-moonlight-morning-glory's coming aren't you girl?
And like he told me, when she holds me
She enfolds me in her world.",Corey's Coming

If my Mary were here
I don't think I'd have phoned you
If my Mary were here
I'm a sad sack Sir Galahad
Who's sword's around his knees
With a Grail no longer holy
And a prayer that's saying, please
I would not be alone
If my Mary were here
But she took off
And Lord I'm lost.

I don't think I'd be drinking
If my Mary were here
And I know what I'd be thinking
If my Mary were here
We'd be wrapping up a blanket
Full of cheddar cheese and wine
Packing up our camper with a rendezvous in mind
And we'd picnic out in Lincoln Park
If Mary were here
But she split
So I got lit

I'm sorry that I called you
In the middle of the night

When I need a little light

Since I dropped you in the dirt
I know you're not my lady now

That your memory might recall

And it leaves no place for pride)

I would toss away my troubles
When my Mary was here
But now I'm lost inside the ruble
Cause my Mary's not here
So could I come on over
With my heart in my hands
And place it on your pillow
Like a rusty old tin can

And my Mary's not here

Oh, God I love myself
When I've got it on
I know I'll live forever babe
All my fears are gone

Then suddenly I'm dying
They turned the laugh track off
I'm drowning in the silence
Crucified by coughs

Oh, I am the laugh man
Half clown and half man
Half out and half in, oh mister can't you see?
I'm s'posed to leave you laughing, so why don't you laugh at me?

Desperate for money
My belly crackin' dirty jokes

Screamin' on a guillotine

Harry Chapin,"In the little town of Candor in the last year of my youth
I learned the final lesson of the levels to the truth
My father was a farmer he'd go tilling in the ground
My mother was a neighbor she'd go visiting around.

But I didn't care.
For I had found the answer to a plow boy's lonely prayer.
She was the daughter of the Mayor.

The Mayor fought my courtship for he'd made other plans
He saw her married to a better man than a boy with farmer's hands.
I said -- I hate your father, it's so hard not to strike him.
She said --You know I love you because you're so much like him.

And so I'd go sneaking in the evening
And there she'd stand a crying in the dawn as I was leaving

But the Mayor of Candor lied
When he offered me his only daughter
The Mayor of Candor tried 
To take her across the water
What a thing to do to a young man in love
What a thing to do to your daughter.

One day with father on his tractor and mother off again
I go to find the mayor and work out what I can
But he is not at his office, he is not at his home
When I find him in the countryside he is not alone

He is holding a woman and imagine my surprise
As she jumps back from his arms I look into my mother's eyes

All my thoughts of outrage, embarrassment and pain
Were washed away by what came roaring through my brain
The Mayor's at my mercy and I hear my own voice say --
Your run for re-election is just one month away.

And the world will never know of what I've seen here sir
But I'll be with your daughter is my meaning clear?

My mother looks in horror at the compromise we made
But the Mayor's rueful smile says the piper must be paid
I had a month of joy in heaven from this deal I'd made in hell
What was to happen then my friend a prophet could not tell

The day after his re-election and the victory celebration
The Mayor takes his family on a month long foreign vacation

Oh Coleen -- you know how much I love you
There is no one I'd ever place above you
Oh Coleen -- you don't even know me
To have you there's nothing that's below me.

But time always passes after all
And as the summer follows spring so does the winter follow fall

The day that they return I stand waiting on the road
I watch the car drive up I watch the passengers unload
Of course she isn't there of course I should have known
The Mayor says that she has stayed the decision was her own.

I spit out my hatred and my fury at his lies
When he says you tried to blackmail me you're just as bad as I
He says go and do your damnedest, throw your mother to the streets
You know it's been too many years I had to be discreet

And as he stands there saying we're just two of a kind
It hits me like a thunderbolt exploding in my mind

As I look into his leering aged wrinkled mirror of my own face
He laughs and sneers and says of course dear son  
Where do you think you came from in the first place?

The Mayor of Candor lied 
When he offered me his only daughter
The Mayor of Candor tried 
To take her across the water
What a thing to do to a young man in love
What a thing to do to your daughter.",The Mayor of Candor Lied

And the Wise Man says, ""Me too!""
And the Guru says, ""Wazoo!""
So do what you do!

The priests stand in their pulpits
The Pope sits on his throne
The parishes are empty
And the choirboys on their own
Until the second coming
Yes, they're leaving us alone
And God in His heaven
Has decided to keep mum

'Cause He's just another traveler
On the Road to Kingdom Come
And all is said and done
He's just another one

Pity Mr. President
He can't do a thing
He says everywhere he went
We tried to make him sing
Our lonely White House resident
Says we should have made him King
Maybe then he could have saved us
From the truth we were hiding from

But he is just another traveler
On the Road to Kingdom Come
And all is said and done
He was just another one

The General's in his game room
But his Soldier won't salute
Ever since he was promoted
He can't pop his chute
His shrink says he is paranoid
'Bout communistic roots
So unfurl the flag boys
Start beating his drum

Yes we've got to get another straggler
On the Road to Kingdom Come
And all is said and done
He was just another one
He's another one

And the Smoke Witch says, ""Wahoo!""
And the Wise Man says, ""Me too!""
And the Guru says, ""Wazoo!""
So do what you do!

Wow! The lead singers raucous
As he screams out the truth
Then the band hold a caucus
And decides to sell their youth

Our Manager he'll hawk us
As along as we're uncouth
And we'll call it revolution
But we'll crank out Bubble Gum
'Cause there's the margin doom for travelers
On the Road to Kingdom Come
And all is said and done
He's just another one

Grampa swung into the orgy
It was his last hope
He was dressed to the nines
In deodorant and scope
And they found him a woman
She brought vaseline and soap
Well it started out exciting
But it ended up ho hum
She said, ""I thought that you could take me
All the way to Kingdom Come""
When all is said and done
He's just another one grampa

So Billy sells hot sermons
And cold wars through the mails
While Mr. Big is selling out
His business never fails
And King Kennedy like Chaucer's
Chasing Canterbury Tales
And though my brain is still a virgin
The rest of me is well done
Don't you know we're all just travelers
On the Road to Kingdom Come
And just a, just a, just another one
When all is said and done
Yeah just another one

And the Smoke Witch says, ""Wahoo!""
And the Wise Man says, ""Me too!""
And the Guru says, ""Wazoo!""
So do what you do!

Do what you do!
Do what you do!
Do what you do!

Harry Chapin,"I got the news today
That you refused to play
'Cause you never made number one
But it's not just the words

It's the deeds that are heard
When all is said and done
Kings take their crowns
They melt them all down

Trying to get the gold out
You went to hell and
Even when you weren't selling
You never ever sold out

You weren't no leader
You were more like a bleeder
Who was trying to cry for us all
You weren't no sage

But your sense of outrage
Sounded like a trumpet call
Fifteen years ago
In the old folky show

You were just one voice in the crowd
But now with so few singing
Your voice would have been ringing
Out 'bout twice as loud

There but for fortune
Say a small circle of friends
Some may see the changes
So, few see the ends

The pleasures of the harbor
Have come to you at last
You may not be marching anymore
But the parade's still going past

I'm not taking the blame
That we killed you
You know you did that to yourself
But it was kind of a shame

That you played that game
'Cause you were better than anyone else
One shot of your bottle
Got you full throttle

It was the friend that was always there
But your greatest gift
And the curse you lived with
Was that you could always care
",The Parade's Still Passing By
Harry Chapin,"You keep looking out my window at the driftwood floating by
Like a flock of birds in fall time you're just itching to fly
I know I cannot hold you 'cause you live life to the hilt
So go on get out of here girl I don't want your guilt

Go on and roll down your river babe
I'll bet you'll make that muddy water churn
You've earned every scar that you brought with you baby
But there's one lesson that you'll never learn
What goes down that river don't return

What goes down don't return
What goes down don't return

Yes I remember when you washed up on my doorstep
You had a dirty face, a damp dress and a dream
But now you're just a fish out of the water baby
It's time to throw you back into the stream

So go on and roll down your river babe
I'll bet you'll make that muddy water churn
You've earned every scar that you brought with you baby
But there's one lesson that you'll never learn
What goes down that river don't return

What goes down don't return
What goes down don't return

Now don't you bleed on me about all our good times
Don't tell me that you'll never be the same
And don't tell me anything but goodbye baby
More than that would be just another game

So go on and roll down your river babe
I'll bet you'll make that muddy water churn
You've earned every scar that you brought with you baby
But there's one lesson that you'll never learn
What goes down that river don't return

You leave me with a month of your sweet madness
You leave me with your music in my head
You leave me with the mystery of the river rolling
You leave me with a desert for my bed

So go on and roll down your river babe
I'll bet you'll make that muddy water churn
You've earned every scar that you brought with you baby
But there's one lesson that you'll never learn
What goes down that river don't return

What goes down don't return
What goes down don't return
What goes down don't return

Harry Chapin,"The kid heard the word up in Brooklyn.
It was his second year of medical school.
He went and stashed some jeans into his guitar case,
His father said, ""You're a fool"".

But the boy jumped on board a Greyhound bus,
It took him two days to get to Mobile,
And though it took two weeks to track the old man down,
He never doubted that the rumor was real.

But there the old man stood by the store front,
With his white cane hanging from his belt.
And he was bending the steel of his guitar strings
So it seemed like the metal had to melt.

He was the last of the street corner singers
Paying his final years of dues
The voice in his throat was like a bullfrog croak
Yes it's he who invented the blues.

""To play the blues, boy, you got to live 'em
Got your dues, boy, you know you got to give 'em
Got to start sweet like a slow blues rhythm
Like a heartbeat you'll always be with 'em

When you're married to the blues, boy,
Your guitar is your wife.
It's like that fine old woman
Who you're faithful to for life.""

Well the kid walked up as the blind man finished 
And was bent to put his guitar away.
The old man heard him and said, ""Who are you?""
""I'm the kid you're gonna teach to play.""

The old man laughed but the kid kept talking 'bout
How he'd help him get around
That's when the old man said, 
""I don't need no fool to get me where in the hell I'm bound""

The kid nods his head with a great big grin and says,
""When do we begin?""
That's when the old man said,
""If You're staying with me

This is how it's got to be...""
""To play the blues, boy, you got to live 'em
Got your dues, boy, you know you got to give 'em
Got to start sweet like a slow blues rhythm

Like a heartbeat you'll always be with 'em
When you're married to the blues, boy,
Your guitar is your wife.
It's like that fine old woman

Who you're faithful to for life.""
""You know I ain't no guru, 
I'm just a blind black preacher man.
My guitar is my gospel, boy,

And I preach with my picking hand
And I preach with my picking hand
I ain't gonna be your wet nurse,
Or black father to an albino son.""

""That's O.K.,"" the kid up and say,
""I just want to pick like a son of a gun!""
""Whoa, boy, that ain't no damn typewriter you're playing, now.
You've got to caress it like a woman, slow and easy""

""Like this, old man?""
""No! A fool plays the blues like Machine Gun Kelly,
Five hundred notes to the bar,
And if you're going to stick with me

You've got to learn what the blues really are
You learn to pick with me and you can stick with me
But it's time to blow this town.
We gots a gig to preach in a gaming house

We're Alabama bound""
So the kid took the hand of the old blues man
To lead him all around the south
Now it's the old man's turn to make the white boy learn

""You don't play guitar with your mouth""
To play the blues, boy, you got to live 'em
Got your dues, boy, you know you got to give 'em.
Got to start sweet like a slow blues rhythm

Like a heartbeat you'll always be with 'em.
When you're married to the blues, boy,
Your guitar is your wife.
It's like that fine old woman

Who you're faithful to for life.
All right, son, let's hear some guitar.
I want you to play it funky like your uncle's carbuncle.
That's right, son, play it sassy like your sweet mama's pajamas.

Used to love the country now I'm selling it.
I'm doing well at it,
That's the hell of it!

I said that we would find a farm
And live out on the land,
It's strange how dreams come back at us
In ways that we had never planned.
Here I'm selling real estate
And laughing at myself,
If I can't have my country dream
I'm gonna sell it out to somebody else!

Darling, don't get mad at me
I'm doing this for you,
It's really not so sad to see we had
Growing up to do.

It turned the water into foam
Destination sweet salvation
Goodbye home sweet home

I'm in the dance band on the Titanic
Sing ""Nearer, my God, to Thee""
The iceberg's on the starboard bow
Won't you dance with me

There was a trombone and a saxophone
The bass and drums were cookin' up the bandstand
And I was strummin' in the middle with this dude on the fiddle
And we were three days out from land

And now the foghorn's jammed and moanin'
Hear it groanin' through the misty night
I heard the lookout shout down ""There's icebergs around""
""But still everything's all right""

Oh, the dance band on the Titanic
Sing ""Nearer, my God, to Thee""
The iceberg's on the starboard bow
Won't you dance with me

They were burnin' all the flares for candles
In the banquet they were throwin' in first class
And we were blowin' waltzes in the barroom
When the universe went CRASH!

""There's no way that this could happen""
I could hear the old captain curse
He ordered lifeboats away, that's when I heard the chaplain say
""Women and children and chaplains first""

Well, they soon used up all of the lifeboats
But there were a lot of us left on board
I heard the drummer sayin' ""Boys, just keep playin'""
""Now we're doin' this gig for the Lord""

I heard the dance band on the Titanic
Sing ""Nearer, my God, to Thee""
The iceberg's on the starboard bow
Won't you dance with me

There's a wild-eyed boy in the radio shack
He's the last remaining guest
He was tappin' in a Morse code frenzy
Tappin' ""Please God, S.O.S.""

Jesus Christ can walk on the water
But a music man will drown
They say that Nero fiddled while Rome burned up
Well, I was strummin' as the ship go down

I'm in the dance band on the Titanic
Sing ""Nearer, my God, to Thee""
The iceberg's on the starboard bow
Won't you dance with me

Dance band on the Titanic
Sing ""Nearer, my God, to Thee""
The iceberg's on the starboard bow
Won't you dance with me

Dance band on the Titanic
Sing ""Nearer, my God, to Thee""
The iceberg's on the starboard bow
Won't you dance with me",Dance Band on the Titanic
Harry Chapin,"I first heard you sing in the Empire Room
Your husky hum engulfed the gloom
And whatever mission that brought me there
Disappeared in the mist of your amber hair

You laughed and surrendered your gifts by degrees
But I was convinced that you spoke only to me
And my life turned on its hinge in that smoky club
As I ground out my past with my cigarette stub

Oh, I do it for you, Jane I love you so
My kingdom is new but it's going to grow
Our castles will shimmer with silver and gold
My lady is lovely she'll never grow old
And I offer this promise this one thing I know
I do it for you, Jane, for I love you so

I left that town and went out on my own
I made my own kind of music as I juggled the phones
And all the while I worked I was reaching towards a time
When I'd return to find you and finally make you mine

It took most of two years to do what must be done
Collect the pieces of the puzzle, you're the final one
I was shaking as I asked you and you know by now I guess
You made me happy ever after when you said yes

Yes, I do it for you, Jane I love you so
My kingdom is flourishing, and still it will grow
Our castle it shimmers with silver and gold
My lady is lovely you'll never grow old
And I shout from the heavens, hello there down below
I do it for you, Jane, for I love you so

If life could only stay the same but I guess it never does
But God I still remember how excited I was
Feelings of power I'd never known before
But winning whets the appetite, I had to have more

Homes in New York and London on the beach at Malibu
I bought one for each facet of woman in you
By then you had retired from singing to bring our baby home
And I was winging around the country and you found you were alone

Still, I do it for you, Jane I love you so
Our kingdom is flourishing and still it will grow
Our castles all shimmer with silver and gold
But my lady is lonely your smile is growing cold
As I search through the mists on the roads I must go
Where are you now, Jane? For I love you so

","I Do It for You, Jane"
Harry Chapin,"I'm the green young gentleman
And you're the lady with the past
I admit I'm insecure about
How long we will last

I sort through in my mind
The little that I know
But the only things I find
From where my musings go

Is that kind of confusion
That just makes more questions come
About the wild and shady world
That you must have wondered from

You see, I have no real complaints
Of how you've left your past behind
I guess what gets me worried
Is you've erased him from your mind

I wonder what happened to him
Your past is a canyon
I'm a stranger on the rim
Looking down below

To where it's misty and dim
But, where there's still shining
A faint glow from a light
It makes me wonder where he is tonight

That drawer of your old photographs
Sits there like detective's leads
With the packets full of letters
That I do not dare to read

And then there is that negligee
That is made for candlelight
You know, I've never seen you wear it
Was it used on other nights?

You see, dream lover of a lady
What shakes me to the core
Is the thought as you caress me
You've done this all before

I think about the future
With me out and others in
Will I, too, have disappeared
Like I've never ever been?

I wondered what happened to him
Your past is a canyon
I'm a stranger on the rim
I'm looking down below

To where it's misty and dim
But, where there's still shining
A faint glow from a light
It makes me wonder where he is
I wonder where he is
Can't help but wonder where he is tonight",I Wonder What Happened to Him
Harry Chapin,"I was laughing horizontally
In my loose and lusty youth
I was feeling well self-satisfied
Deliciously uncouth
When she slipped out from my covers
With a smile
Saying, ""You've got a lot to learn, dear boy
It's going to take a while.""

She said--
Manhood--Means that you should
Get someone else, beside yourself 
Feeling good
You know a real man would
Do much more than you could
You know he'd wonder if he
understood me!
I said, ""I see, let's start again.""
She said, ""You know you never can.""

She put her clothes back on
She straightened up my bed
She hit me with a line
The still does numbers on my head
She says, ""Your mind chooses better
Than your hands do
Your heart chooses better
Than your glands do!""

She said--
Manhood--Means that you should
Get someone else, beside yourself 
Feeling good
You know a real man would
Do much more than you could
You know he'd wonder if he
understood me!
I said, ""I see, let's start again.""
She said, ""You know you never can.""

So I stood there in my shorts
Feeling naked just the same
With her last few words
I knew I was brand new at the game
She gave her gentle smile
She slipped out through the door
Saying, ""You're my first and only love
Just like all my lvoes before.""

She said--

Harry Chapin,"It's a slow motion night
In the hot city lights
Past time when the good folks
Are snoring in bed

On a loose-jointed cruise
To recolor your blues
With illegal notions alive,
Alive in your head

You are back from some war
That you've been fighting for
Some old blue blood bastard 
In a dark pinstripe suit

and the word from your loins
Has your mind in your groin
And your back pocket burning with blood
Blood money loot

So, you walk past the glow
Of the flicker-picture shows
Where the raincoat men wait
For a child to come by

And the women in doorways
Who have nothing to say
'Cause your money is talking 
To the ones that you would try

She owns the block
With the dead pawnshop clock
She's the answer to dreams 
That you pay to come true

She's got no heart of gold
But that's not what she's sold
She just sees herself doing what she
What she has to do

And she's all that you're hoping
As her coat falls open
Give her bread she leads you
To a bed on the floor

Where for ten million years
And through ten billion tears
The armies of bootmen have marched
Back from their wars

She's in that state of grace
Before time finds her face
With a mind of old wisdoms
And a body still young

And she tastes as sweet
As a child's chocolate
Before the butts and the whiskey
Had wasted the taste of your tongue

Play the music again
Of the grey-stubble men
That groaning blue symphony
Moans evermore

And you watch as she fakes it
And of course you just take it
She's better than others
You never paid money for

You've used up your booty
The girl's done her duty
The turnstile has turned 
And you learn you are done

You're back on the street
Joining fresh marching feet
You see more soldiers coming
And your girl chooses one

And the medic has brought
Shots for what you have caught
Your leave is all over
You're back on the line

And the joke in the trenches
Of the hot blooded wenches
And the next thing that you'll do
When they next give you the tim.

And you're back in your army
Back shedding red blood
And you dream of the girl
As you sleep in the mud

And you know you'd swap with her
If the deal could be made
'Cause you'd rather be working at love
Love as your trade",Mercenaries
Harry Chapin,"At first you seemed just like my dream
Of a finer better life
Much more than I could ask for
In a lover or a wife
Though I work with my body
And my work makes my hands rough
There are gentle things inside me
That are anything but tough

There are lessons you could teach me
Things I do not know
Things I've never done, girl
And places we could go
But you only wear your tailored suits
For me to rip and tear
Ah, can't I hold you quietly
And smell your perfumed hair?

I saw you as the answer
That I never dared to dream
I saw you as the window 
Into a world I'd never seen
I saw you as the vision
Come to raise me from the mud
But you came to use my sweat to cool
The fever in your blood

I'm not Marlon Brando 
On his motorcycle bike
When you call me your animal
It's a name I do not like
Please do not tear my back
Yes, of course I bleed
The violence you thirst for
Is not what I need

Your silken skin is armor
That begs for brutal hands
But why can't I be gentle
And tell you of my plans?
I know that you're using me
Not I just using you
And you're not so scared 
Of losing me as I losing you

At first you seemed...",Mismatch
Harry Chapin,"She wore an S.E.G. when she came back home
Like the cat that ate the canary
And I stood befuddled, a chauvanist stud
With his mistress quite contrary
I was smack up against the moment
I was afraid i would face someday
But the truth is a wall that you can't blow down
And it won't be laughed away

You see, my old lady went and took herself 
A young man last night
It got me crazy when she said, 
""Baby, don't you get uptight,
I think maybe it's the time for you to see the light,""
She said, ""It's alright now, boy, I'm yours tonight.""

Now I admit my imagination's been 
The sweetest sinner of all
Yes it lives like a snake in Eden
And it forgives each time I fall
So I've been Casanova
I've double-dated with Don Juan
And though I've been doing almost everything
I never dreamed she'd be carrying on!

You see, my old lady went and took herself

""Baby, don't you get uptight,

She said, ""It's alright now, boy, I'm yours tonight.""

She says that she still loves me
She says that last night was no big deal
She says, ""Why can't a woman play the same damn game
And act out what she feels?""
She says she's going to take a bath
I hear her singing in the tub upstairs
While I'm sitting here spitting out chunks of my heart
Forced into being fair,
While she's splashing rround up there,
I'm supposed to act like I don't care,
I hear the devil laughing somewhere!

Harry Chapin,"Well, I hear you are a painter now
Though you're almost halfway through
You pulled a pallet knife, you cut away a wife
And you started something new

But it was not the strife of married life
That ordained what you would do
A quick look back through your history
Shows the same things goading you

It's just like you to try painting
Because you're color blind
Each time you conquer something
That's the time you change you're mind

And now your new preoccupations
Give you your handicap to start
Yes you're happiest when you're chasing clouds
With a halfway broken heart

Paint a picture of yourself
Let the images flash past
Don't weep on watercolors, Michael
Make this moment last
Paint the kid with restless eyes
Yeah, the way you looked back then
'Cause the man keeps getting frightened
When the boy's not born again

I remember how you led us
Back when we all were kids
And that fact that you were older
Made us copy what you did

The day you bought that cheap guitar
We all fell into line
We got hooked on music
But you drifted off in time

So, I can see you at your easel
Splay legged there you stand
And your eyes are darting back and forth
Brush flashing in your hand
You're reaching always for that dream 
You need to make you real
Leaning in a heavy wind
That no one else can feel",Paint a Picture of Yourself (Michael)
Harry Chapin,"There's a kid out on my corner, hear him strumming like a fool
Shivering in his dungerees, but still he's going to school
His cheeks are made of peach fuzz -- his hopes may be the same 
But he's signed up as a soldier out to play the music game 

There are fake patches on his jacket -- he's used bleach to fade his jeans 
With a brand new stay pressed shirt -- and some creased and wrinkled dreams 
His face a blemish garden -- but his eyes are virgin clear 
His voice is Chicken Little's -- But he's hearing Paul Revere 

When he catches himself giggling -- he forces up a sneer 
Though he'd rather have a milk shake -- he keeps forcing down the beer 
Just another folkie -- late in coming down the pike 
Riding his guitar -- he left Kid brother with his bike 

And he's got Guthrie running in his bones 
He's the hobo kid who's left his home 
And his Beatles records and the Rolling Stones 
This boy is staying acoustic 

There's Seeger singing in his heart 
He hopes his songs will somehow start 
To heal the cracks that split apart 
America gone plastic 

And now there's Dylan dripping from his mouth 
He's hitching himself way down south 
To learn a little black and blues 
From old street men who paid their dues 

'Cause they knew they had nothing to lose 
They knew it 
So they just got to it 
With cracked old Gibsons and red clay shoes 

Playing 1-4-5 chords like good news 
And cursed with skin that calls for blood 
They put their face and feet in mud 
But oh they learned the music from way down there 

The real ones learn it somewhere 
Strum your guitar -- sing it kid 
Just write about your feelings -- not the things you never did 
Inexperience -- it once had cursed me 

But your youth is no handicap -- it's what makes you thirsty 
Hey, kid you know you can hear your footsteps as you're kicking up the dust 
And the rustling in the shadows tells you secrets you can trust 
The capturing of whispers is the way to write a song 

It's when you get to microphones the music can go wrong 
You can't see the audience with spotlights in your eyes 
Your feet can't feel the highway from where the Lear jet flies 
When you glide in silent splendor in your padded limousines 

Only you are crying there behind the silver screen 
Now you battle dragons -- but they'll all turn into frogs 
When you grab the wheel of fortune -- you get caught up in the cogs 
First your art turns into craft -- then the yahoos start to laugh 

Then you'll hear the jackals howl 'cause they love to watch the fall 
They're the lost ones out there feeding on the wounded and the bleeding 
They always are the first to see the cracks upon the walls 
When I started this song I was still thirty-three 

The age that Mozart died and sweet Jesus was set free 
Keats and Shelley too soon finished, Charley Parker would be 
And I fantasized some tragedy'd be soon curtailing me 
Well just today I had my birthday -- I made it thirty-four 

Mere mortal, not immortal, not star-crossed anymore 
I've got this problem with my aging I no longer can ignore 
A tame and toothless tabby can't produce a lion's roar 
And I can't help being frightened on these midnight afternoons 

When I ask the loaded questions -- Why does winter come so soon? 
And where are all the golden girls that I was singing for 
The daybreak chorus of my dreams serenades no more 
Yeah the minute man is going soft -- the mirror's on the shelf 

Only when the truth's up there -- can you fool yourself 
I am the aged jester -- who won't gracefully retire 
A clumsy clown without a net caught staggering on the high wire 
Yesterday's a collar that has settled round my waist 

Today keeps slipping by me, it leaves no aftertaste 
Tomorrow is a daydream, the future's never true 
Am I just a fading fire or a breeze passing through? 
Hello my Country 

I once came to tell everyone your story 
Your passion was my poetry 
And your past my most potent glory 
Your promise was my prayer 

Your hypocrisy my nightmare 
And your problems fill my present 
Are we both going somewhere? 
Step right up young lady -- Your two hundred birthdays make you old if not

Senile 
And we see the symptoms there in your rigor mortis smile 
With your old folks eating dog food and your children eating paint 
While the pirates own the flag and sell us sermons on restraint 

And while blood's the only language that your deaf old ears can hear 
And still you will not answer with that message coming clear 
Does it mean there's no more ripples in your tired old glory stream 
And the buzzards own the carcass of your dream?

Sing happy ever after 

There's a Dance Band on the Titanic 
Singing Nearer My God to Thee 
And the iceberg's on the starboard bow 
Won't you dance with me 

Yes I read it in the New York Times 
That was on the stands today 
It said that dreams were out of fashion 
We'll hear no more empty promises 

There'll be no more wasted passions 
To clutter up our play 
It really was a good sign 
The words went on to say 

It shows that we are growing up 
In oh so many healthy ways 
And I told myself this is 
Exactly where I'm at 

But I don't much like thinking about that 
Harry -- are you really so naive 
You can honestly believe 
That the country's getting better 

When all you do is let her alone 
Harry -- Can you really be surprised 
When it's there before your eyes 
When you hold the knife that carves her 

You live the life that starves her to the bone 
Good dreams don't come cheap 
You've got to pay for them 
If you just dream when you're asleep 

There is no way for them 
To come alive 
To survive 
It's not enough to listen -- it's not enough to see 

When the hurricane is coming on it's not enough to flee 
It's not enough to be in love -- we hide behind that word 
It's not enough to be alive when your future's been deferred 
What I've run through my body, what I've run through my mind 

My breath's the only rhythm -- and the tempo is my time 
My enemy is hopelessness -- my ally honest doubt 
The answer is a question that I never will find out 
Is music propaganda -- should I boogie, Rock and Roll 

Or just an early warning system hitched up to my soul 
Am I observer or participant or huckster of belief 
Making too much of a life so mercifully brief? 
So I stride down sunny streets and the band plays back my song 

They're applauding at my shadow long after I am gone 
Should I hold this wistful notion that the journey is worthwhile 
Or tiptoe cross the chasm with a song and a smile 
Well I got up this morning -- I don't need to know no more 

It evaporated nightmares that had boiled the night before 
With every new day's dawning my kid climbs in my bed 
And tells the cynics of the board room your language is dead 
And as I wander with my music through the jungles of despair 

My kid will learn guitar and find his street corner somewhere 
There he'll make the silence listen to the dream behind the voice 
And show his minstrel Hamlet daddy that there only was one choice 
Strum your guitar -- sing it kid 

Just write about your feelings -- not the things you never did 
Inexperience -- it once had cursed me 
But your youth is no handicap -- it's what makes you thirsty, hey kid
Strum your guitar -- sing it kid 

Just write about your feelings -- not the things you never did

Harry Chapin,"We got married early
And just a little bit late
Baby came too early
But some things just can't wait
We were just beginning
But it was very clear
We grew up a little bit that year

I caught on as a meter man
You were caught at home
When I started night school
You ended up alone
But you had another baby
While I had my career
And we grew up a little bit
We grew up a little bit
We grew up a little bit that year

They put me in a office job
A young man on the move
We bought a house in Shaker Heights
You supervised the move
We were cashing checks, you were changing children
While I played engineer
And we were growing ever faster
Every year

I got bored of kilowatts
You were tired of kids
I started staying out at night
And soon that's what you did
At parties we'd go separately 
You'd wiggle and I'd leer
And we were growing faster
We were growing ever faster
We were growing ever faster every year

You learned to live in silence
I learned to live in lies
And we both igored the empty spaces
Growing in our eyes
Your breath became a gin and tonic
Mine became a beer
And we grew up a little more last year

Today at work they passed me by
And promoted John instead
I came home to find you'd wrecked the car
I guess I lost my head
Well, I can't believe I hit you
But the rage came on so strong
Ah, where did we go wrong?

As you sit there crying
I wonder who you are
The partner-stranger-friend and foe
Who's come with me this far
We stand here in the ashes
And I guess it is quite clear
We did not really grow too much
Each year

So you say we're going nowhere
Well I know that's where we've been
Still I can't help wondering
Can we begin again?
I feel so full of questions
Curiosity and fear
But could we grow a little bit
Could we grow a little bit
Can we grow a little bit this year?",We Grew up a Little Bit
Harry Chapin,"You were chasing him down Braodway on that white-hot July,
'Cause he thought he'd got a message from some holy man on high.
He said his chance had finally come; he'd done it on his own,
He had to leave his past behind; the first thing that had to go--was home.

You put him in an aeroplane and packed your life and clothes,
You learned all the lessons that the suitcase lady knows.
He said, ""Something still drags me back from where I'm heading to,""
You didn't really understand, 'til the next thing that had to go--was you.

Some things are sacrificed and some things remain,
Some things bring pleasure and some things bring pain.
Some things must pass away, and some things are regained,
When the whole world is changing, why should people stay the same?

You saw his picture in the paper, that disarming boyish smile,
You sometimes had to swallow hard as you saw him on the dial.
You heard him on a talk show, he was hearing no one else,
Then suddenly you knew too well, the last thing he'd left behind--was himself.

Some things are sacrificed and some things remain,
Some things bring pleasure and some things bring pain.
Some things must pass away, and some things are regained,
When the whole world is changing, why should people stay the same?

So you pulled yourself together, friends and family said you should,
You discovered you were doing things you never knew you could.
And someday when he calls you, which you know of course he'll do,
You'll just send him away again, 'cause the last thing you finally
found--was you.",Why Should People Stay the Same
Harry Chapin,"The little boy went first day of school
He got some crayons and started to draw
He put colors all over the paper
For colors was what he saw
And the teacher said.. What you doin' young man
I'm paintin' flowers he said
She said,
It's not the time for art young man
And anyway flowers are green and red
There's a time for everything young man
And a way it should be done
You've got to show concern for everyone else
For you're not the only one

And she said
Flowers are red young man
Green leaves are green
There's no need to see flowers any other way
Than the way they always have been seen

But the little boy said
There are so many colors in the rainbow
So many colors in the morning sun
So many colors in the flower and I see every one

Well the teacher said
You're sassy
There's ways that things should be
And you'll paint flowers the way they are
So repeat after me

And she said
Flowers are red young man
Green leaves are green
There's no need to see flowers any other way
Than the way they always have been seen

But the little boy said
There are so many colors in the rainbow
So many colors in the morning sun
So many colors in the flower and I see every one

The teacher put him in a corner
She said
It's for your own good
And you won't come out 'til you get it right
And all responding like you should
Well finally he got lonely
Frightened thoughts filled his head
And he went up to the teacher
And this is what he said, and he said

Flowers are red, green leaves are green
There's no need to see flowers any other way
Than the way they always have been seen

Time went by like it always does
And they moved to another town
And the little boy went to another school
And this is what he found
The teacher there was smilin'
She said
Painting should be fun
And there are so many colors in a flower
So let's use every one

But that little boy painted flowers
In neat rows of green and red
And when the teacher asked him why
This is what he said
And he said

Flowers are red, green leaves are green
There's no need to see flowers any other way
Than the way they always have been seen.",Flowers Are Red

Well, I wonder what would happen to this world?

Now if a man tried to take his time on Earth
And prove before he died
What one man's life could be worth
Well, I wonder what would happen to this world?

And if a woman, she used a lifeline
As something more than
Some man's servant mother wife time
Well, I wonder what would happen to this world?

Oh well, I wonder, yes, I wonder
'Bout what would happen
What would happen to this world?
Well, I wonder what would happen to this world?

As I look around us there's such strange things
There's muggers and there's jugglers and we are led by clowns
If an answer ever found us, would we change things?
Or are we just a people rotten ready for the ground

And if our future lies on the final line
Are we brave enough
To see the signals and the signs
I wonder what would happen to this world?

We see the people, we see them marchin' down
Do we join the parade
Or do we try and turn around
Well, I wonder what would happen to this world?

Oh well, I wonder, yes, I wonder
'Bout what would happen
What would happen to this world?
Well, I wonder what would happen to this world?

Disciple children walk the streets, selling books and flowers
Can they be last ones with a semblance of a dream?
If we say that no one's out there and we say we're goin' nowhere
And we avoid the question, is this all that it means?

Oh, if a man tried to take his time on earth
And prove before he died
What one man's life could be worth
And I wonder what would happen to this world

Oh well, I wonder, yes, I wonder
'Bout what would happen
What would happen to this world?
Well, I wonder what would happen to this world?
Yes, I wonder what would happen to this world?
",I Wonder What Would Happen to This World
Harry Chapin,"Oh God they got you gun shy
You know your skin's as cold as ice
Your eyes are double filtered babe
You're so afraid to be nice
There's no way you're ready
To let your defenses down
Though I won't come on heavy
There is a lesson that I've found

If you try to look
But you don't touch
Then you won't touch
But you'll never feel
And if you don't feel
You'll never cry
And if you don't cry
Then you'll never heal

There are lessons to life
That the lovers got to learn
There are corners out there
You know they're waitin' somewhere
And you've got to be prepared to turn
There are callouses that come
That the lovers got to earn
In the years of your youth
You can't be fire proof
You know you've got to get burned

Can't you feel excitement
Feel it welling up inside
What makes you think emotion
Is something that you hide
Yes I might take advantage
But I'll be gentle if I do
And I'll be here in the morning
Still lookin' at you",If You Want to Feel
Harry Chapin,"Just after I screamed at you, ""What the hell is it all about""
You spilled your coffee onto my sleeve, and you said
""Don't expect the tears to come from me babe
For I've already grieved""

But that's when you let me
Back into your dream

And I know you're frightened by my laughter
But you're not afraid to hold my pain
You see I'm never sure what you're after, babe
But it seems you only love me when it rains

You never treat me like you treat a gentle man
You only hit me when you know it hurts
But then why bother reaching down to where I'm battered
You got to raise me up from the dirt

Still that's when you let me
Back into your dream

I know you're frightened by my laughter
But you're not afraid to hold my pain
You see I'm never sure of what you're after, babe
But it seems you only love me when it rains

I have sworn to myself to stay protected
So I have strapped on a sword and a shield
But my Armour yes it ends up meltin'
When you come along tumblin' across the field
Once again I yield, I yield

Yes you get me crazy
'Cause you never even wear my presents babe
You wear flowers tucked into your hair
But when I'm cursin' in the night in my frustration
That's when suddenly you are there

Once again that's when you let me
Back into your dream

And I know you're frightened by my laughter
But you're not afraid to hold my pain
You see I'm never sure just what you're after, babe
But it seems you only love me when it rains

How come you only love me when it rains
How come you only love me when it rains
How come you only love me when it rains
How come you only love me when it rains
How come you only love me when it rains

Harry Chapin,"It was when I rode off in my daydreams
Chasing that vision of light
It was then I got caught in the jet stream
And I dropped through a hole in the night

I saw each of us living alone
And I prayed that you still could be waiting
That's when I started for home

I've seen the City of Angles
With the names of its dead in the street

And for once I knew I was all wrong
And I thought of you there in my door way
And I knew I've been travelin' too long

Oh my Jenny my love

Oh my Jenny

As I crossed to the heart of the country
I was lost in a forest of signs
And I laughed 'cause life gets so funny
Here I was wasted from wastin' my time
So now shine down your sun on my shadow
Without you I don't mean a thing
And I gather me one golden morning, babe

But up 'til now you've not been free to be 
Foolin' around with the likes of me. 

But it's changed now, though it's strange how, 
He's the one that arranged it now. 
But he's a poor damned fool 
'Cause he went and let you go now. 

Just a poor damned fool.

Yes I've had my ups and downs 
As I've been ramblin' around 

And I'll be candid. 
I could not believe my eyes 
When I finally realized 
Just what that man did. 

Yes I've heard 'bout finders keepers 
And how losers are the weepers, it's OK, 
I know it's my lucky day 
Still I just got to say...

And you'll forget about yesterday 
'Cause you feel so good. 

It's worked out real good. 
You make me feel so good. 
I've been tryin' to find a way to cope 
With grasping straws And fallen hopes. 

But he's made a way 
And now his misfortune is my gain. 
Though for now it gives you pain 
It'll fade away 

And you'll find that as the years roll by 
The memories of the time you cried 
Will be laid away 
Yes, they'll fade away

And you'll forget that poor damned fool 
'Cause he went and let you go now. 
Just a poor damned fool. 
He never will know now. 

Maybe someday he'll be sad. 
I say that that's too bad 
He never knew how much he had. 
I'm glad I got you now.

Harry Chapin,"Somebody said...Where's the music goin'
Somebody said...It's gone
Somebody said...With this bad wind a blowin'
Will the music keep a rolling on
I had to ask myself
Why it's makin' me
A minstrel man from cradle to grave
Should there be somewhere else
It could be takin' me
As it rolls on over like a wave

Somebody said...We got to find the words
Got to, got to be an answer there
Somebody said that...You never get heard
'Cause nobody really cares
Do your feet just dance
Where the waves begin
Stop thinkin' as you're sinkin' below
Or do you take this chance to sail on the wind
When so many in the water chose to row

Some may curse the crippled
Some try to hide the hurt
Some they hate the hungry
But who's dying down there in the dirt

Somebody said...Has the man enlightened us
Somebody said...Who knows
And then the little boys said...Well I may be frightened
But the Emperor has got no clothes
As the passion dies
But the beat goes on
The conductor got us singing his song
He's been feedin' these lies
That we've been feasting upon
But now we've been at the banquet too long

Somebody said...Where are the dreamers
Somebody said...Dead
Somebody said...Here comes the holy rollers
Tryin' to sell us all the screamers instead
Since we were once deceived
When we received the call
Now the cynics are the prophets of the day
And now the weak ones grieve
As the strong ones fall
And the rest of us have nothing to say
Some suffer in silent sadness
Some come to worship pain
Some just welcome madness
But you can't come in from the rain

Harry Chapin,"If you were looking for a way to make me mad it was a sure fire way you found
Acting like a half wit fool, laying your money around
Well I came back here to tell you Lou, 'bout what you almost did
Don't you ever put the cash on the counter Lou, when I'm with my kid
Yeah the kid's thirteen he's growing Lou, two years and he'll be bigger than me
Still he thinks I'm strong as a blacksmith and straighter than the tall oak tree
I raised him alone ten years now since his Mama ran away
And you ain't gonna blow his image of me for the stunt like you pulled today

[Chorus]
They took the copper right out of the penny Lou
They got the pig locked up in the pen
But you're in big trouble with me, yes you
If you ever do that again
Ten bucks a week protection don't mean I can't knock you down
You've got to treat me like a living saint Lou, whenever my son's around

Yeah the kid wants to be a policeman just like me
You know he'll be a good one the way I started out to be
And he just might end up police chief, now wouldn't that be something to see?
'Cause then the kid would kick right off of the force all the two-bit grifters like me

[Chorus]

I guess it was when my old lady left me and she took off with a salesman guy
I started to see things so differently, cut your own slice out of the pie
Yeah I grew up and it came clear to me all the smart cops on the make
You get a silver badge not an old tin star when you're on the take
It's pimps and whores, punk gang wars, robberies and homicides
When you walk the beat with the creeps on the street, well there ain't no way to hide
I spent half my life without no wife ridin' herd on the scum of the earth
I learned the tricks of the trade from the gutter parade and then I prayed for all I'm worth
Don't you know I appreciate the money Lou, 'cause it all goes into the bank
And when I send my kid to college someday I'll have guys like you to thank
Yeah ten bucks a week on your grocery store means you don't have to worry 'bout crime But hold your money when the kid's with me you can pay me double next time

Harry Chapin,"Harry: ""And the excitement continues to build! Eat your heart out, Peter Frampton."")

It seems like two months
'Though I met her tonight
Something just told me
It would work out alright
So I asked her to act out
What was there in our heads
No need for games, babe,
Let's hop into bed
(audience reacts, Harry says, ""I figured that'd get ya."")
That's when I said

""Oh, get on with it
Let's get it done
Life is made up of moments
Let's not miss this one
Oh, get on with it
Before it's too late
We know where we're going
There's no, no, no, no need to wait.""

But that's when she says
""Let's take it slowly
You don't really know me
If we make it holy
Maybe it will last
What is your hurry
You don't need to worry
The one thing we know
Is that time, time, time goes too fast.""

Soon it's working so well
I got her moving in
All the permanent thoughts
Already begin
You see she is the woman
That I want for my wife
I say, ""Let's set a date, babe,
And get on with our life.""
And that's when I said again

""Oh, get on with it
Let's get it done
Life is made up of moments
Let's not miss this one
Oh, get on with it
Before it's too late
We know where we're going
There's no, no, no, no need to wait.""

But once again she says
""Let's take it slowly
Still you don't know me
If we make it holy
Maybe it will last
What is your hurry
You don't need to worry
The one thing we know
Is that time, time, time goes too fast.""

I don't know what happened
As we moved along
But all of a sudden
It came out all wrong
She said, ""It's all over
Let's not drag out the end
If we split up now
Then at least we'll stay friends.""
And that's when she said

""Get on with it
You know it's all done
We had our moments
Don't dwell on this one
Oh, get on with it
You know it's too late
Oh, yes, it's all over
There's no, no, no, no need to wait.""

But that's when I say
""Let's take it slowly
You know how you know me
And once it was holy
Don't give up so fast
What is your hurry
You don't need to worry

Is that time, time, time goes too fast.""",Get on with It
Harry Chapin,"We are the lovers
We are bound to one another
By a bond that is invisible
Yet stronger still than time

And we're locked into the motion
That moves beneath the ocean
Rolling toward the future
That makes pain the only crime

Now I know you are the answer
You're the damsel and the dancer
The angel with the devil eyes
That knows about the beat

You remove the masks and faces
And you see the shadowed places
That only witches look for
In the cradle of the heat

Have you heard of the
Legend of the Lost and Found?
It tells of a world turnin' upside down
When all the kings have become the clowns

The beggars are crowned
The Legend of the Lost and Found

So I become the reacher
More the pilgrim than the preacher
The savage's been ravaged
By the visions of the smoke

As I'm peeling back the layers
To the passions of my prayers
I have seen the ramparts
Where the molten waters broke

Your heart's a sacred kingdom
That has colonized my soul
My past's the shattered fragment
That somehow you made whole

Today's your gift to fondle
Your offering to feel
Tomorrow is the promise
That somehow you've made real

Have you heard of the
Legend of the Lost and Found?
It tells of a world turnin' upside down
When all the kings have become the clowns

The beggars are crowned
The Legend of the Lost and Found

So l'll sing you every silly, sad
And happy song I know
And you'll open every part of you
That you've got left to show

And I'll pour myself around you
Like the sunshine drowns the field
And in the golden softness we will yield
And in the golden softness we will yield

One day this dude drives in the station
And I slide out to the pump
And he says, "" I need some odd jobs done
Can you get off from this dump?""

Well, I can always use some extra bread
So I nod and take the job
When he says, ""Clean up before you come
I do not hire slobs ""

Now you can see I'm not no fancy pants
But everyone has pride
And especially since this lovely lady's
Sittin' by his side

Still something keeps my trap shut
And I nod again, "" Alright ""
And he gooses his Mercedes
And he squeals off in the night

It's more a palace than a pad
And it kind of makes my pick-up truck
Start looking pretty bad

But the same lady swings the door back
And before one word is said
She leads me to his trophy room
Where he sits with his stuffed heads

He's got this list of jobs for me to do
While he's out of town
And he says, ""I'm too damn busy boy
The way I move around""

And I'm fixin' up some stairs
When I feel that someone's watching me

And she says, ""I like to watch you work
You have such supple hands""
She says, ""Can I help you?""
And I say, ""Baby you can""

Well, she looks me in the eyes, boys
I admit I looked a little lower
That's when she starts breathing faster
And I start working slower

You see when you have a helper
With her attitude and grace
You start puttin' lots of extra hours
Workin' 'round the place

I give part time help
I'm the odd job man
I can't do what I want
So I do what I can

And I'll tell you now
So that you will understand
You get just what you pay for

Well, a month had too soon come and gone
With my odd jobs all done
When who should pull up to the pump
But the long-lost prodigal son

And he says, ""Here's a hundred dollars, boy""
Pulls the bill off from his wad
And he starts to hand it over
Like a gift come straight from God

I say, ""That's just a buck an hour sir""
He says, ""That's what I pay for jerks""
Now I admit that almost blew my cool
But I staggered back to work

You see most times when it's said and done
There's justice to this life

I'd done to his wife

Harry Chapin,"It was my first night in that rooming house
In the last room down the hall
I heard a hoarse voice and an old guitar
Coming through the paper thin walls

A crazy nonsense nursery rhyme
That did not mean a thing
But for the first of what was to be a thousand times
This is what I hear him sing

Hold that D chord on the old guitar
'Til I found the G
Drop it down to old E minor
'Til the A chord rolls back home around to D

I had to lay there listening
It seemed he was in the room
This stranger with his melody
Singing there in the gloom

And he repeated it over and over again
Such a soft and sinkin' sound
It was kind of like a music box
That was slowly winding down

You see, he sang it, he hummed it
Whistled it, and he strummed it
He laughed it and he cried it
He did everything but hide it

And he sang
Hold that D chord on the old guitar
'Til I found the G
Drop it down to old E minor
'Til the A chord rolls back home around for me

So I lay there in that lumpy bed
Countin' choruses instead of sheep
'Til I banged on the wall and out I called
""Hey bub, I need some sleep""

The sudden void of silence
Then I heard that hoarse voice say
""It weren't so long ago, boy
They paid me to play ""

I said, ""It's kind of late for music, sir
Two hours 'til it's daylight""
He answered, ""I need my music most
In these dark hours of the night

You see I've tried gettin' high on something son
But it only brings me down
Staying dry don't work out better, boy
'Cause my eyes get wet and I drown

Won't you please let me continue
And I'll be in your debt?
You see I'm not singing to remember, son
I'm just singing to forget""

And he sang
Hold that D chord on the old guitar
'Til I found the G
Drop it down to old E minor
'Til the A chord rolls back home around for me

That's when I said
""If I'm supposed to listen to you sir
Just one quick question then
Why in the hell do you sing one song
Over and over again?""

And this is what he said
He said, ""I gave her the music, son
She gave me the words
Together we'd write the kind of songs
The angels must have heard

Of course we'd fight like cats and dogs
But life ain't no rosebud dream
Still whatever we'd do everybody knew
We truly were a team

I can't remember now if I done her wrong
Or if she done wrong to me
But all I know that when I let her go
That it did not set me free''

That's when I said, ""You sound like what's-his-name""
He said, ""That's who I am
But you can't wrap a name around you, boy
'Cause it really don't mean a damn""

""You see, a song don't have much meaning
When it don't have nothing to say
What she could do was magic, son
All I could do was play""

He started singing again
That's when I drifted off
Maybe I dreamed what I heard
'Bout this stranger with his melody
Who'd gone and lost the words

Hold that D chord on the old guitar
'Til I found the G
Drop it down to old E minor
'Til the A chord rolls back home around to D

Harry Chapin,"The old lady on the park bench
In the park with just one tree
Was there from the very first day
That you were part of me

It seemed like she'd been sitting there
Since 1000 B.C.
And you said, ""She is as permanent
As anything can be""

From that first day
We were three
The old lady and you and me

You sat there in the window
You were looking 'cross the street
You said, ""The birds and the old lady
Yet the same bread crumbs they eat""

I could not get you back to bed
'Till you took them both a treat
And I learned that you were twice as stubborn
As you could be sweet

From that first day
We were three
The old lady and you and me

Do you remember that summer rain storm
On the day that you moved in?
I was caught in the excitement
Of what was to begin

Well, you disappeared for a little while
And when I asked you where you'd been
You said you'd lent the old lady my new umbrella
Then you gave me that wicked grin

From that first day
We were three
The old lady and you and me

Yes, on March 21st the first day of Spring
The old lady would be there
Spend all the days of summer
Then she'd disappear somewhere

Where she spent her falls and her winters, babe
No one was aware
But you were the first to wonder
Yeah, you were the first to care

It was three years we were together
The old lady held that spot
Through the nights when life was wonderful
Through the days when it was not

And the times we were in trouble
In a way we sometimes got
Just knowing that she was out there
Meant we gave it just one more shot

From that first day
We were three
The old lady and you and me

Well, it's March 21st the first day of Spring
And you know what I had to do
I got up and I ran to the window
To confirm what I already knew

I wish I had your address to send this letter to
You see the old lady's not on the park bench
And I'm still wondering where are you?
Where are you, where are you?
",We Were Three
Harry Chapin,"Oh God Babe, you've been good for me
Good when I been barely holding on
And you did what you could for me
When all the ones I counted on were gone

You picked me up in your battered blue
Volkswagen, babe
You laid me down on the mattress on the
Floor that was your bed
Some wisdom in you told you
Ministering to my body
Brought a temporary respite to the
Demons that were screaming in my head

Oh God Babe, you've been good for me
Good when I been barely holding on
And you did what you could for me
When all the ones I counted on were gone

You see it was not the things you told
Me
Though what you told me served to
Make me smile
You just knew enough to hold me, and
In holding me you held off the night
A little while.

You had a beach and a cottage and
Some nights that were free
You had those eyes that smiled in a
Dream
But I was lost, confused and still you
Seemed to see
How I was tired of running rapids, I
Was trying to find an island in the stream

Oh God Babe, you've been good for me
Good when I been barely holding on
And you did what you could for me
When all the ones I counted on were gone

You see it was not the things you told
Me
Though what you told me served to

You just knew enough to hold me, and

Harry Chapin,"Remember when the music 
Came from wooden boxes strung with silver wire
And as we sang the words, it would set our minds on fire,
For we believed in things, and so we'd sing.

Remember when the music 
Brought us all together to stand inside the rain
And as we'd join our hands, we'd meet in the refrain,
For we had dreams to live, we had hopes to give.

Remember when the music 
Was the best of what we dreamed of for our children's time
And as we sang we worked, for time was just a line,
It was a gift we saved, a gift the future gave.

Remember when the music
Was a rock that we could cling to so we'd not despair,
And as we sang we knew we'd hear an echo fill the air
We'd be smiling then, we would smile again.

Oh all the times I've listened, and all the times I've heard
All the melodies I'm missing, and all the magic words,
And all those potent voices, and the choices we had then,
How I'd love to find we had that kind of choice again.

Remember when the music
Was a glow on the horizon of every newborn day
And as we sang, the sun came up to chase the dark away,
And life was good, for we knew we could.

Remember when the music
Brought the night across the valley as the day went down
And as we'd hum the melody, we'd be safe inside the sound, 
And so we'd sleep, we had dreams to keep.

And I feel that something's coming, and it's not just in the wind.
It's more than just tomorrow, it's more than where we've been,
It offers me a promise, it's telling me ""Begin"",
I know we're needing something worth believing in.

Remember when the music 
Came from wooden boxes strung with silver wire
And as we sang the words, it would set our minds on fire,

Harry Chapin,"So here she's actin' happy inside her handsome home
And me, I'm flyin' in my taxi, takin' tips and gettin' stoned
I got into town a little early
Had eight hours to kill before the show
First I thought about heading up north of the bay
Then I knew where I had to go
I thought about taking a limousine
Or at least a fancy car
But I ended up taking a taxi
'Cause that's how I got this far
You see, ten years ago it was the front seat
Drivin' stoned and feelin' no pain
Now here I am straight and sittin' in the back
Hitting Sixteen Parkside Lane
The driveway was the same as I remembered
And a butler came and answered the door
He just shook his head when I asked for her
And said ""She doesn't live here anymore""
But he offered to give me the address
That they were forwarding her letters to
I just took it and returned to the cabbie
And said ""I got one more fare for you""
And so we rolled back into the city
Up to a five-storey old brownstone
I rang the bell that had her name on the mailbox
The buzzer said somebody's home
And the look on her face as she opened the door
Was like an old joke told by a friend
It'd taken ten more years but she'd found her smile
And I watched the corners start to bend
And she said, ""How are you Harry?
Haven't we played this scene before?""
I said ""It's so good to see you, Sue
Had to play it out just once more""
Play it out just once more
She said I've heard you flying high on my radio
I answered ""It's not all it seems""
That's when she laughed and she said, ""It's better sometimes
When we don't get to touch our dreams""
That's when I asked her where was that actress
She said ""That was somebody else""
And then I asked her why she looked so happy now
She said ""I finally like myself, at last I like myself""
So we talked all through that afternoon
Talking about where we'd been
We talked of the tiny difference
Between ending and starting to begin
We talked because talking tells you things
Like what you really are thinking about
But sometimes you can't find what you're feeling
Till all the word run out
So I asked her to come to the concert
She said ""No, I work at night""
I said, ""We've gotten too damn good at leaving, Sue""
She said, ""Harry, you're right""
Don't ask me if I made love to her
Or which one of us started to cry
Don't ask me why she wouldn't take the money that I left
If I answered at all I'd lie
So I thought about her as I sang that night
And how the circle keeps rolling around
How I act as I'm facing the footlights
And how she's flying with both feet on the ground
I guess it's a sequel to our story
From the journey 'tween heaven and hell
With half the time thinking of what might have been
and half thinkin' just as well
I guess only time will tell",Sequel
Harry Chapin,"I can see myself it's a golden sunrise
Young boy open up your eyes
It's supposed to be your day
Now off you go horizon bound
And you won't stop until you've found
Your own kind of way
And the wind will whip your tousled hair
The sun, the rain, the sweet despair
Great tales of love and strife
And somewhere on your path to glory
You will write your story of a life

And all the towns that you walk through
And all the people that you talk to
Sing you their songs
And there are times you change your stride
There are times you can't decide
Still you go on
And then the young girls dance their gypsy tunes
And share the secrets of the moon
So soon you find a wife
And though she sees your dreams go poorly
Still she joins your story of a life

So you settle down and the children come
And you find a place that you come from
Your wandering is done
And all your dreams of open spaces
You find in your children's faces
One by one
And all the trips you know you missed
And all the lips you never kissed
Cut through you like a knife
And now you see stretched out before thee
Just another story of a life

So what do you do now?
When she looks at you now?
You know those same old jokes all the jesters tell
You tell them to her now
And all the same old songs all the minstrels sang
You sing 'em to her now
But it don't matter anyhow
'Cause she knows by now

So every chance you take don't mean a thing
What variations can you bring
To this shopworn melody
And every year goes by like a tollin' bell
It's battered merchandise you sell
Not well, she can see",Story of a Life
Harry Chapin,"My child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talking 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say, ""I'm gonna be like you, dad
You know I'm gonna be like you.""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, dad?"" ""I don't know when
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then.""

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, dad; come on, let's play
Can you teach me to throw?""
I said, ""Not today, I got a lot to do.""
He said, ""That's okay.""
And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed
And said, ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him.""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, dad?"" ""I don't know when
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then.""

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man, I just had to say
""Son, I'm proud of you. Can you sit for a while?""
He shook his head, and he said with a smile
""What I'd really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later; can I have them please?""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, son?"" ""I don't know when
But we'll get together then, dad
You know we'll have a good time then.""

I've long since retired, and my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind.""
He said, ""I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time
You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, dad
It's been sure nice talking to you.""
And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, son?"" ""I don't know when
But we'll get together then, dad
We're gonna have a good time then.""",Cat's in the Cradle
Harry Chapin,"She has no fear of failure, she's not bent with broken dreams.
For the future's just beginning when you're always seventeen
It was nineteen sixty-one when we went to Washington;
She put her arms around me and said, ""Camelot's begun.""

We listened to his visions of how our land should be;
We gave him our hearts and minds to send across the sea.
Nineteen sixty-three, white and black upon the land;
She brought me to the monuments and made us all join hands.

And scarcely six months later she held me through the night
When we heard what had happened in that brutal Dallas light.
Oh, she is always seventeen;
She has a dream that she will lend us and a love that we can borrow.

There is so much joy inside her she will even share her sorrow;
She's our past, our present, and our promise of tomorrow.
Oh, truly she's the only hope I've seen, and she is always seventeen.
It was nineteen sixty-five and we were marching once more

From the burning cities against a crazy war.
Memphis, L.A. and Chicago we bled through sixty-eight
Till she took me up to Woodstock saying with love it's not too late.
We started out the seventies living off the land;

She was sowing seeds in Denver trying to make me understand
That mankind is woman and woman is man,
And until we free each other we cannot free the land.
Oh, she is always seventeen;

She has a dream that she will lend us and a love that we can borrow.
There is so much joy inside her she will even share her sorrow;
She's our past, our present, and our promise of tomorrow.
Oh, truly she's the only hope I've seen, and she is always seventeen.

Nineteen seventy-two, I'm at the end of my rope,
But she was picketing the White House chanting,
""The truth's the only hope.""
In nineteen seventy-five when the crooked king was gone

She was feeding starving children saying the dream must go on.
She is always seventeen;
She has a dream that she will lend us and a love that we can borrow.
There is so much joy inside her she will even share her sorrow;

She's our past, our present, and our promise of tomorrow.
Oh, truly she's the only hope I've seen, and she is always seventeen.",She Is Always Seventeen
Harry Chapin,"Leon wrote a song for his special girl
And Elton and bernie did too!
But you've been mine for such a long time
Baby
It's my turn to write one for you
And this is the best
That this poor boy could do.
You see I don't know what to tell you babe
I can't say thanks a lot
For I know I really owe you
For almost everything I got.
You were with me in the good times
And when things were going bad
You were with me when your love
Was the only thing I had.
I have been a song man
For a long long time
Coming up with some melodies
Trying to find some words that rhyme.
And while I have been singing
You've been there to see me through
And so I think it's long past time
That I wrote this song for you.
I was going to keep it simple
And not make it too long
But I had hoped to make it beautiful
For after all it is your song.
You know how I love my music
It is my life and my livelihood
But of all that's happened to me babe
You are everything that's good.




",Song Man
Harry Chapin,"I came into town with a knapsack on my shoulder
And a pocket full of stories that I just had to tell.
You know I've knocked around a bit,
I've had my share of small town glories,
And it's time to hit the city and that crazy carousel.

I been feeling sorry for myself,
But you know I was only lonely,
Like everybody else.
Until...

You brought your Sunday morning sunshine
Here into my Monday morning rain.
You taught me happiness just one time,
It keeps on coming back again.

These streets were never highways
For I had not known the sky above.
These days were never my days
For I had not known your love.

It's funny how a city can put on a different face,
When it holds the one you care for
It becomes a different place.
And I never felt so far from alone.
Baby you brought me halfway home.
Yes, baby, you brought me halfway home.

You brought your Sunday morning sunshine
Here into my Monday morning rain.
You taught me happiness just one time,
It keeps on coming back again and again and again...

You brought your Sunday morning sunshine
Here into my Monday morning rain.
You taught me happiness just one time,
It keeps on coming back again and again and again...

You brought your Sunday morning sunshine
Here into my Monday morning rain.
You taught me happiness just one time,
It keeps on coming back again and again and again...

You brought your Sunday morning sunshine
Here into my Monday morning rain.
You taught me happiness just one time,
It keeps on coming back again...
",Sunday Morning Sunshine
Harry Chapin,"It is an early Monday morning.
The sun is becoming bright on the land.
No one is watching as he comes a walking.
Two bulky suitcases hang from his hands.

He heads towards the tower that stands in the campus.
He goes through the door, he starts up the stairs.
The sound of his footsteps, the sound of his breathing,
The sound of the silence when no one was there.

I didn't really know him.
He was kind of strange.
Always sort of sat there.
He never seemed to change.

He reached the catwalk. He put done his burden.
The four sided clock began to chime.
Seven AM, the day is beginning.
So much to do and so little time.

He looks at the city where no one had known him.
He looks at the sky where no one looks down.
He looks at his life and what it has shown him.
He looks for his shadow it cannot be found.

He was such a moody child, very hard to touch.
Even as a baby he never smiled too much. No no.No no.

You bug me, she said.
Your ugly, she said.
Please hug me, I said.
But she just sat there
With the same flat stare
That she saves for me alone
When I'm home.
When I'm home.
Take me home.

He laid out the rifles, he loaded the shotgun,
He stacked up the cartridges along the wall.
He knew he would need them for his conversation.
If it went as it he planned, then he might use them all.

He said Listen you people I've got a question
You won't pay attention but I'll ask anyhow.
I found a way that will get me an answer.
Been waiting to ask you 'till now.
Right now !

Am I?
I am a lover whose never been kissed.
Am I?
I am a fighter whose not made a fist.
Am I?
If I'm alive then there's so much I've missed.
How do I know I exist?
Are you listening to me?
Are you listening to me?
Am I?

The first words he spoke took the town by surprise. 
One got Mrs. Gibbons above her right eye.
It blew her through the window wedged her against the door.
Reality poured from her face, staining the floor.

He was kind of creepy,
Sort of a dunce.
I met him at the corner bar.
I only dated the poor boy once,
That's all. Just once, that was all.

Bill Whedon was questioned as stepped from his car.
Tom Scott ran across the street but he never got that far.
The police were there in minutes, they set up baricades.
He spoke right on over them in a half-mile circle.
In a dumb struck city his pointed questions were sprayed.

He knocked over Danny Tyson as he ran towards the noise.
Just about then the answers started comming. Sweet, sweet joy.
Thudding in the clock face, whining off the walls,
Reaching up to where he sat there, answering calls.

Thirty-seven people got his message so far.
Yes, he was reaching them right were they are.

They set up an assault team. They asked for volunteers.
They had to go and get him, that much was clear.
And the word spread about him on the radios and TV's.
In appropriately sober tone they asked ""Who can it be?""

He was a very dull boy, very taciturn.
Not much of a joiner, he did not want to learn.
No no.No no. 

They're coming to get me, they don't want to let me
Stay in the bright light too long.
It's getting on noon now, it's goin to be soon now.
But oh, what a wonderful sound!

Mama, won't you nurse me?
Rain me down the sweet milk of your kindness.
Mama, it's getting worse for me.
Won't you please make me warm and mindless?

Mama, yes you have cursed me.
I never will forgive you for your blindness.
I hate you!

The wires are all humming for me.
And I can hear them coming for me.
Soon they'll be here, but there's nothing to fear.
Not any more though they've blasted the door.

As the copter dropped the gas he shouted ""Who cares?"" .
They could hear him laughing as they started up the stairs.
As they stormed out on the catwalk, blinking at the sun,
With their final fusillade his answer had come.

Am I?
There is no way that you can hide me.
Am ?
Though you have put your fire inside me.
Am I ?
You've given me my answer can't you see?
I was!
I am!
And now I will be
I will be",Sniper
Harry Chapin,"When the summer fled past my window
And autumn's chill was in the air
There's a special kind of lonesome
'Round that ending time of year

When the leaves fell
And they drifted 'neath the trees
That soon were bare
I felt that wind blow ever colder
And suddenly you were there

We laughed and scuffled
While the snow fell
And the cold gave your cheeks a glow
And in your arms come evening
A kind of peace I know

Often I'd wake at midnight
Mid some icy winter storm
But then I would find you beside me
And you made the night seem so warm

Now I go my way, you go your way
Now that the winter's come and gone
But somehow with the springtime
Your golden warmth still lingers on
",Winter Song
Harry Chapin,"It was raining hard in 'Frisco
I needed one more fare to make my night
A lady up ahead waved to flag me down
She got in at the light

Oh, where you going to, my lady blue
It's a shame you ruined your gown in the rain
She just looked out the window, she said
""Sixteen Parkside Lane""

Something about her was familiar
I could swear I'd seen her face before
But she said, ""I'm sure you're mistaken""
And she didn't say anything more

It took a while, but she looked in the mirror
And she glanced at the license for my name
A smile seemed to come to her slowly
It was a sad smile, just the same

And she said, ""How are you Harry?""
I said, ""How are you Sue?
Through the too many miles
And the too little smiles
I still remember you"" 

It was somewhere in a fairy tale
I used to take her home in my car
We learned about love in the back of the Dodge
The lesson hadn't gone too far

You see, she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
And I took off to find the sky

Whoa, I've got something inside me
To drive a princess blind
There's a wild man, wizard
He's hiding in me, illuminating my mind

Oh, I've got something inside me
Not what my life's about
'Cause I've been letting my outside tide me
Over 'till my time, runs out

Baby's so high that she's skying
Yes she's flying, afraid to fall
I'll tell you why baby's crying
'Cause she's dying, aren't we all

There was not much more for us to talk about
Whatever we had once was gone
So I turned my cab into the driveway
Past the gate and the fine trimmed lawns

And she said we must get together
But I knew it'd never be arranged
And she handed me twenty dollars
For a two fifty fare, she said
""Harry, keep the change"" 

Well, another man might have been angry
And another man might have been hurt
But another man never would have let her go
I stashed the bill in my shirt

And she walked away in silence
It's strange, how you never know
But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for
Such a long, long time ago

You see, she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
I took off for the sky

And here, she's acting happy
Inside her handsome home
And me, I'm flying in my taxi
Taking tips, and getting stoned
I go flying so high, when I'm stoned",Taxi [Live]

You dance without a smile.
Kid you may not have great rhythm,
But you sure got style.
Just four years old and still it seems,
You've got it figured out.
When daddy sings, and then you dance,
The people clap and shout.

Cause, you're my dancin' boy,
And it's so scary how you trust me.
Just one look from you,
And I come pouring out like wine.
Dancin' boy, I'm sure by now that you must see,
You're dancin' means much more to me,
Than any dream of mine.

Yes, I'm so proud when you are with me,
That my heart digs in my throat.
And when you stop to strut your stuff,
My eyes go all afloat.
And when I have to leave you home
As sometimes it must be.
I feel that with my leaving
I leave far too much of me.

Yes, you're my dancin' boy,
And it's scary how you trust me.
Just one look from you,
And I come pouring out like wine.
You're my dancin' boy,
I'm sure by now that you must see,
You're dancin' means much more to me,
Than any dream of mine.

You know the time will come my dancin' boy
When you're dancin' days are done,
And when daddy and his dancin' boy
Will have dwindled down to one.

You know the world will've taught you other steps
To match the march of time,
So you'll have to keep our dancin' days
Dancin' in your mind.

Yes, do your dancin' , boy,
Cause it's so scary how you trust me.
Just one look from you,
And I come pouring out like wine.
Do your dancin' , boy.

Well, another man might have been angry
And another man might have been hurt

And I was gonna learn to fly

Harry Chapin,"Hello honey, it's me
What did you think when you heard me back on the radio?
What did the kids say when they knew it was their long lost daddy-o?
Remember how we listened to the radio
And I said 'That's the place for me'
And how I got the job as an FM Jock the day you married me?
We were two kids and I was was into AM rock
But I just had to run around

Let me tell you 'bout what's gone down

I am the morning DJ on WOLD
Playing all the hits for you wherever you may be
The bright good-morning voice who's heard but never seen
Feeling all of forty-five going on fifteen
The drinking I did on my last big gig made my voice go low
They said that they liked the younger sound when they let me go
So I drifted on down to Tulsa, Oklahoma to do me a late night talk show
Now I worked my way back home again, via Boise, Idhao
That's how this business goes

I've been making extra money playing high school sock hops
I'm a big time guest MC
You should hear me talking to the little children
And listen what they say to me
Got a spot on the top of my head, begging for a new toupee
And a tire on my gut from sitting on my
But they're never gonna go away
Sometimes I get this crazy dream
That I just drive off in my car
But you can travel on ten thousand miles and still say where you are
I've been thinking that I should quit disk jockeying
And start that record store

Maybe I could settle down if you'ld take me back once more
Okay honey, I see
I guess he's better than me
Sure, old girl, I understand
You don't have to worry, I'm such a happy man

Has very little time to rest

He has a merry tune to toot
He knows a song
Will move the job along

Never tire ever buzzing to and fro, no

From every flower that they sip

Their task is not a grind

"Harry Connick, Jr.","Because I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad
My father gave my nose a tweak and told me I was bad
Then one day I learned a word that saved my achin' nose
The biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes

Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

I've traveled all around the world and everywhere I went
I'd use my word and all would say, ""There goes a clever gent""
But when Dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me
I say my special word and then they ask me out to tea

It must've been ol' Santa 'cause I saw his big red hat
And I know my mom and dad can't fly like that

And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door

I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh
Then ol' Santa took me up up and away

We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show
It was really past my bedtime and so ol' Santa said
""Little boys like you should be in bed""

So I hollered ""Ho! Ho! Ho!""
And I put on Santa's hat

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

"Harry Connick, Jr.","I know you so well
I can tell by the sound of your voice
If you're really in love with me
And you are
You are

You know I can't lie
If I say to you 'baby, I love you'
Then baby, I love you
And I do
I do

I do, could it be that's the
Phrase you thought never would phase you
Well baby, you better hold on tight
'Cause I'm the one who's supposed to
Kneel down and propose, well alright
I might, I might

So, when I kiss you good-night
Just sleep tight with the thought that you'll
Always be caught up in love with me
And you'll dream that the stars up above
Have the answer of whether we'll be
Or whether we won't be
In love
Well, we are,

"Harry Connick, Jr.","I think I saw ol’ Santa through my window Christmas eve
My eyes were really droopy but I really do believe
It must’ve been ol’ Santa ’cause I saw his big red hat
And I know my mom and dad can’t fly like that, oh no
I know my mom and dad can’t fly like that

And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door
The same ol’ Christmas trick, my dad had played since I was four
He stands outside my bedroom yelling, ""Ho ho ho"", because
He knows I don’t believe in Santa Claus, no way
He knows I don’t believe in Santa Claus

I think my daddy sees me, peeking from my door
But he pretends, he’s Santa anyway
Every year he tries to fool me
But I’m a big boy now, I don’t believe in Santa or his sleigh, no way

So I went back to bed and I curled up nice and tight
I stared out my window and I looked into the night
And then, all of a sudden, through my window I could see
Santa Claus was flying by and smiling at me

Santa Claus, Santa Claus
It must’ve been ol’ Santa Claus
Santa Claus, Santa Claus
Happy, ho ho ho, to you

Then I heard ol’ Rudolph tellin’ me to come outside
He told me that ol’ Santa wanted me to take a ride
I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh
And then ol’ Santa took me up and away
Santa took me up up and away

We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show
It was really past my bedtime and so ol’ Santa said
""Little boys like you should be in bed""

So I hollered, ""Ho ho ho"" and I put on Santa’s hat
Then he let me hold the reins awhile
We pulled up to my window and I jumped back in my room
And I waved goodbye to Santa with a smile

When I woke up Christmas morning it was clear and bright
My parents said my window had blown open in the night
I smiled as I told them that it must’ve been the cat
And they asked me where I got my big red hat, yeah yeah
They asked me where I got my big red hat

Santa Claus, Santa Claus
It must’ve been ol’ Santa Claus
Santa Claus, Santa Claus
Happy, ho ho ho, to you

Happy, ho ho ho, to you
Happy, ho ho ho, to you

My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
Maybe someday, you'll see my face amoung the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la la, la la la la la la",My Cherie Amour
Harry James,"Cherry, cherry, you're hard to get
Cherry, cherry, I'll get you yet
Cherry, cherry, don't you forget
Cherry, cherry, you'll be my pet

And when I do you'll find out
Just what love is all about

Oh, cherry, cherry, don't you forget
Cherry, cherry, I'll get you yet
Cherry, cherry, I'll get you yet",Cherry
Harry James,"When the moon hangs low in Napoli
There's a handsome gondolier
Every night he sings so happily
So his lady love can hear
In a manner oh gravissimo
He repeats his serenade,
And his heart beats so fortissimo
When she raises her Venetian shade

Ciribiribin, chiribiribin, ciribiribin

Ciribiribin, he waits for her each night beneath her balcony
Ciribiribin, he begs to hold her tight, but no, she won't agree
Ciribiribin, she throws a rose and blows a kiss from up above
Ciribiribin, ciribiribin, ciribiribin, they're so in love

(Orchestral Interlude)

Ciribiribin, ciribiribin, ciribiribin, they're so in love",Ciribiribin (They're So in Love)
Harry James,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You
Harry James,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light
Harry James,"In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me

Harry James,"Never thought that you would be 
standing here so close to me 
there's so much I feel that I should say 
but words can wait until some other day 

Kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time
Haven't felt like this, my dear

Since I can't remember when
It's been a long, long time
You'll never know how many dreams
I've dreamed about you

Or just how empty they all seemed without you
So kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time

Ah, kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long time
Haven't felt like this my dear

Harry James,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
Harry James,"A sleepy lagoon, a tropical moon and two on an island
A sleepy lagoon and two hearts in tune in some lullaby land
The fireflies' gleam reflects in the stream
They sparkle and shimmer
A star from on high falls out of the sky
And slowly grows dimmer
The leaves from the trees all dance in the breeze
And float on the ripples
We're deep in a spell as nightingales tell
Of roses and dew
The memory of this moment of love
Will haunt me forever
A tropical moon, a sleepy lagoon
And you",Sleepy Lagoon
Harry James,"You made me love you 
I didn't wanna do it 
I didn't wanna do it 
You made me want you 
And all the time you knew it 
I guess you always knew it 

You made me happy sometimes 
You made me glad 
But there were times 
You made me feel so bad 

You made me cry for 
I didn't wanna tell you 
I didn't wanna tell you 
I want some love that's true 
Yes, I do, 'deed I do 
You know I do 

Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie, gimmie what I cry for 
You know you've got the brand of kisses 
That I'd die for

Harry James,"Last night I started out happy
Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

Harry James,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves
Harry James,"Don't cry, Oh honey please don't be that way
Clouds in the sky should never make you feel that way
The rain will bring the violets of May, tears are in vain
So honey, please don't be that way.
As long as we see it through,
You'll have me, I'll have you.
Sweetheart, tomorrow is another day,
Don't break my heart,
Oh honey, please don't be that way.",Don't Be That Way
