The Beatles,"When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be",Let It Be [outtake]
The Beatles,"The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door",The Long and Winding Road [outtake]
The Beatles,"Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly girl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

La la how the life goes on
Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra

Buys a twenty carat golden ring

In a couple of years they have built 
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones

Happy ever after in the market place

Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

The Beatles,"I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus' garden in the shade

I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus' garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade.

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus' garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy you and me

There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, ""I'm gonna get that boy""
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

Now the doctor came in, stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, ""Rocky, you met your match""
And Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able""

Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival",Rocky Raccoon [Take]

The Beatles,"Wilson, Wilson
Wilson, Wilson
Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

But I just had to look, having read the book

Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
Ahh, ahh, ahh

The Beatles,"To lead a better life I need my love to be here
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere and if she's beside me 
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not;
He just wrote it like that.
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song.
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are, they just play it like that
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song.
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct, there's nobody there.
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
And I told you there's no one there.",Only a Northern Song [Mono Version]

And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.

And tho' she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway.

We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in

In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in.

They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking.

It's the hard little pistol-packing punk dope smuggler
Lethal when I kill, I go straight for the jugular
Back again to hit ya with the junkyard funk
Shit gets out of hand, I got a Tec in the trunk
Let's flip the ill shit kid, yo he looped it
Hardcore, straight to make you brothers act stupid
Now I'm on a rampage, prepare for the slaughter
Lyrical monster busting nuts in your daughter
Slaying competition is the real beat digger
(Clank) Hit you with a shovel now you're dead, nigga
Freaking the funk, I be the ill funk freaker
With the diabolical sound coming through your speaker
Bulletproof ready for action, no fronting
Fully loaded Tec loaded ready to go hunting
So sleep and watch me let off and catch wreck
""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the tec""

	When I pop the trunk, hit the deck

To beef, so he can get killed by the psycho thief
Retarted like Biz, eating cats like Heath-

If I kill you first nigga, be a good sport and
Die, don't give me no hassle
I snatch up your bitch, take her to White Castle
To crack her asshole, so I could fuck her
That doo doo brown dem bucker
The crazy rapist smelling like much vaginas
Carjacking punks, pulling them out of their Pathfinders
It makes me want to scream, but I just chill by the end of the week
How many punks must I kill?
I'm sicking up picnics, I'm robbing on good so after dark
Stay the fuck out the woods (You fucking punk!)

I'll let you go this time, but next time you pop

Intoxicated punks letting off bad smell

Bring heavy ammunition so you don't have to run
Take heed, this ain't something you should laugh to

Fills the room like buddha stick, uhuh, don't like choke

Niggas can't see this flow so it's time to down sit 'em
I kick the flow for the niggas with the bald heads
Dreads, and 'fros, honey's, but no ho's
Oops! I didn't mean to call you ho, bitch
But when you try to clock the pocket that's that bullshit!

Seed to the brain like primatine to clear the sinus

Ain't another brother kickin' phat beats with spunk

Diggin' through shit that I found out in the park lot
Talk not, bustin' crazy shots at the don't squeeze

Somebody said you were looking for static G
Those who try to play me close could die tragically
I got a merciless flow that's infatically fatal

[stic.man] Beatnuts, dead prez
[woman] What I want to sayyy

[stic.man and/or m1]
Everytime I look around, I see
So much drama goin down
Everytime I look around, I see
So much fakeness goin down

[stic.man]
Why I'ma- be stingy when I could share?
Why I'ma- be hateful if I could care?
Why would I hate my own?
Or forsake my own?
Why would I- fuck around and get a jake on my chrome?
I wouldn't- have to stick you if we all could eat
It wouldn't be no need for beef
Dyin over streets we don't even own anyway
You could get bucked off anyday
We behind enemy lines
y'all still writin Hennessy rhymes
While I'm tryna find a good price for a nine
Feel like my life on the line
That's why a nigga be hype all the time
Ready for the revolution at the drop a'a dime

[m1]
I got a duty to have security for my niggas
My duty to serve the beautiful black sistas
A duty to stand wit' anybody that's wit' us
And fully criticize all bullshittas
There should be awards presented- to niggas who fight back
Like Panther jackets, or sistas who light gats
I'm a full-blooded warrior, ready for change
Recognize any soldier that's doin the same
Because I love who I am, and that means everything to me
My life ain't worth a damn unless I'm dealin with reality
When I look myself in the eyes, it's just me
And I don't have to tell nobody no lies, I feel free
And I would rather deal with the truth and falsehood
Than bein fake with my people and claimin 'it's all good'
You can't run away from ya self, so that's useless
If your word is bond, then you don't have to make excuses

Everytime I look around, I see
So much drama goin down
--Hold up! [intro to 'Old School Survival']
[crowd] Wait a minute!
Let's take it back to the old school
[man talking] Yo, 'memba back in the day?

Yo, yo, Yo flipmode is how this nigga roll 

Finger on the trigger low, quick to lick a shot for that bigger pot of gold 

Lock and load, my heavy metal rock and rolls 

If you gotta go you gotta go, that's part of the show 

My heart is cold like a Nautica nailin niggaz like carpenters 

Stalkin the hardest squadrons, spark em from New York to Arkansas 

Watchin the projects is how I got my logic 

Economics is pickin pockets then we split the profit 

The only shit I pop is what my glock spit 

Watch for the cops since we spark the chocolate 

Cause the blocks are hotter than the fuckin tropics 

In topless bars, college girls with no bras 

My whole squad got blow jobs smokin Godfather cigars 

Live large like Scarface, parlayin to far place 

No car chasin, she's watchin all the stars in space 

Safe and sound in my playground with my tre pound 

Got eighty rounds just in case clowns want to play around 

I lay it down for them non-believers

My gods got the block sewn to the inseam

Warrin with self I battle, the Middle Eastern way 

Bring heat like the months, that's east of May 

Casket in the road and saw a new school that knows the old 

This memory I hold the scroll, my flow is a Road...Less Traveled 

You rock, but been through less gravel 

My mystique suggest battle and what have you 

Rip a nigga from New York to west coast, Chicago 

Don't give a fuck where he from he'll get beat like a drum 

Till this rap goes numb, seekin the hot Medusa from circulation 

I strangle this string music, and suffocate a drum 

Wanted to be a star till I seen I was the sun/son

Comparing me to another's going to lead to an argument
The heat we fry you with, straight from the armory

I'm in my truck cruising, 97 tuned in

Walking round like he hurting something
And there's nothing that he got to say that's even worth discussing
Listen to me, it's better to be
Lying dead with honor, soldier, than to never be free
Young niggas out here losing they dads
In the battle of the son of the fags
Every other country burning the flag
Don't let history repeat itself
That's how the devil plan to keep his wealth and feed himself

Hit the devil in the fucking shitter
Take his manhood and all his glitter
Got guns ready to bust

Jump on her producers 
Hit the exit, the tunes is dumb soft

You're an alcoholic
You're an alcoholic red nose reindeer like Rudolph
I'm here to tear the roof off
And if you want to take it to the guns, I'ma shoot off

Your head before you reach for the pistol
And when the bartender turns around I'ma reach for the Cristal
You not ready for this style, I'm straight Psycho wit it
And I bet you in love with, yeah Psycho hit it

A long time ago, I'ma keep doing my thizzle
Till it's time to go, but for now it's time to blow
Good as me in the club popping bubbly
I can't complain life is lovely
Either you hate me or you love me

Fans wanna know when the Nuts is gonna come next
It doesn't matter competition is no contest
I don't mean to brag, I'm just being honest
Where my dogs at smoking up at the college?

Clap your hands to the beat and get your bounce on
Put your drinks up, if your blazing get you ounce on
Girl I'd house you, but this ain't no house song
And no kissing, I dunno what you had your mouth on

Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuff
Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge
Bother nobody less you fucking with us

You can bring it to us however you want
Shake your, booty, booty I'm ready to fuck
Especially the shorty with that big butt
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck

Look, don't approach me in a physical manner
'Cause the cannon I'm holding ain't a digital camera
And I don't care less about women and glamor
Or which one of you rappers is lifting his hammer

I'ma get loose like a pair of pajamas
I speak through those switches, spit like Obama
Trying to get rich without guns and the scanner
Thats A to the K with a fucking bandanna

Seize your empire, believe in no lies
Squeeze the deserties like Jesus inside her
Spit like the shit on my teeth is barbwire
Make your girl suck cock till her knees are on fire

That's it though, no more games
This one right here is gonna blow your brains
If you in the club you better hold your chain
Cause I'm bugging and I just might stomp your frame

Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuff
Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge
Bother nobody less you fucking with us

You can bring it to us however you want
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck
Especially the shorty with that big butt
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck

Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuffs
Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge
Bother nobody less you fucking with us

You can bring it to us however you want

I was swerving thru Queens
Fully growin' benz
Searching for the butta thru my cartier lense system
Banging out nothing but the blends on the digital startec
Rappin' to my mens
Then spotted the most exotic, cheekiness, half Rachel, half Holly
My shit is
The slo mo, crept up nice and slow
Breathin' on my ice, so it shine real nice
Crease my scar peice
Laid back in my seat
Right near Bazely projects, on the back streets
Her name was Keisha, full of street knowledge
Pumped a little trees, but she planned to go to college
Staring at my ice, smellin' my cologne
She lived on the southside, so bring things on
Honey got flavour, and it just don't stop
Does she want me for me, or me for my rocks

She slid up my whip, like the queen of New York
We jetted to city island to eat shrimp and talk
Sourced up my keys to the valet cat
I glanced at the fatty, I'm a see about that
We blazed in the spizza like Bonnie and Clyde
Scooby dooby hizza
I'm feeling the vibe, cop the blue for some video type shit
Knowing all along how hot these kind of nights get, uh
I've got her right where I want her
Reality about to creep up on her
Stroke her softly, gently with my G
While the light reflects off my icp
Waiter, ice the crystal, let it simmer
Lights to bright, here's a grand make them dimmer

She pulled down the staps to her dress
Reached in the ? sparked up sess
Banging some Wu Tang feeling the ??
She said ""Now would you wanna sell your soul for chips,
and give up girl to push whips?""
Never miss some spiritual down to my bone
Why you takin' jumbo in that zone
She said ""I would do anthing for ?????
Give deep ? to ? man coats
Take off my ??
Drop to my knees""
Talking in my face
Breath smelling like cheese
I asked her
Shorty you degrade yourself
Just to throw a little bit of ice on the shelf
You turnin' me off, I can't lie
Keisha said ""why?""
I said, ""yo, how can a man respect that, knowin' if he paid, 
then he correct that""
Ice is the price for an overnight wife
A true shark caller don't want that in his life
So all you ladies that are selling you're souls
You need to put you hooker vibes on hold
Ask for Keisha, she working on the stroll, 
Dead ass broke, but her pimp the man grow

The Beau Brummels,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Leaves still change their colours,
Prophets lay still in their graves.

Chop injustice at its knees.

Insecurity for love ?
Fear for empathy ?
Education in place of push and shove ?

Still the same as it was back then.

And I don't have the answers,
For those questions anymore.
Only love can beat both heaven and hell.

So sturdy up, sturdy up your heart,
For the road is long ahead.
I'll be with you even though we're apart,

All of everything I knew.
Of how to live this life be true.
Don't bow your head to no one,
And no matter what you do,
If you start then see it through.

It's getting harder to see now that the lights have all gone out.
Can't pay for the electricity.

And all along they've been saying nothing new to me.
Lately, seems right is wrong and wrong is everything we need maybe.
And still the beds are burning, burning in our sleep.
Take me away from everything I see.

There' gunshots on the dancefloor.
Please tell me what do we die for?
And by the way, yesterday, bet you were me.

Seen hard days, probably see more.
There's police at the front door saying
""by the way, yesterday, heard you were free.""

as long as these hearts beat in our chests.
And we fell through the railings and pavements,
while I wondered if they get what I get.
And I promise you I won't be leaving,
without taking you where I go.
See the price of belief's in believing.
Anywhere that we go we'll be share this same old song.

And we'll be standing singing.

Wanna let the rhythm flow and feel the bassline slip.
Leaving all that fussing and a fighting to them crazy, crazy fools.
But it's time I told you something I think you should know.
All about why I ran away and why I let this go.
Guess I got tired of always feeling like my heart just broke.
Tired of missing you.

And I don't want to fight with you no more.
Really, how many times can we go to war?
Really, how many days do we have to waste,
Before we can see that we've both made mistakes?

And I'm over always feeling like some hypocrite,
Telling you things are ok when they don't feel like it.
But I'm not sure that once your heart gets broke the pieces fit
Together quite the same.
So if you don't mind just for a while
I'm a keep this mess
That I call a heart, cracked and bleeding in this chest.
Dear God I wish sometimes we had never met.
Still, I love you anyway.

But hey, yo what difference does it make?
There's no sense in this.
No reason's I guess, gonna make it hurt less.

Screaming as the days go slipping by.
Working two jobs just to get on by these days.
Two kids, no husband, on the streets.
Been spending all her money on some food to eat.
Been sleeping in her car on the back seat these days.

Keep moving, get through this, get to this, don't do this.
She's sick of her life, living this way.
Keep flowing, keep going, been so long since knowing,
Just how it feels to be ok, these days.

Rollin', parking her car in the alleyway.
Leaving in her keys for the getaway.
Dropped her kids off at her folks today so they,
Wouldn't see what it is mama had to do,
Just to get on by, just to push on through.
""There'll be a better day and it's coming soon"" she prays.

The Beautiful Girls,"Girl, I''ll meet you underneath the tree where I first tried to kiss you.
Well when I was 4 and you were 3 you know we were meant to
Be married someday but life goes away before you notice it leave.

Now all those places have all gone away
Where we used to hang out with our friends and say 
""One day we're gonna live, we're gonna live, we're gonna live, gonna live it up.""
So close to the surface our hearts beating.
Was the only sound we'd hear deciding
What we were gonna do, we were gonna do, 
We were gonna do to push on through.

And if I told you I was worth it would you tell me you won't go?
Lord knows I try but I'm not perfect.
But I told you so. Yes I did you know
And if its all show, then we're already gone.

And I know its only been a while, but I still miss you.
I'd give anything if it'd make me be here with you.
See the more that things change, the more they're the same.
But there'll always be you and me.

Since all we ever tried to do's been undone
Maybe we can maybe someday run away
We could be new, we could be new
We could be new girl, me and you.
Or we'll laugh at stupid things that we've done
Never realising what we've become
Until it's too, until it's too
Until it's too late to be true.

And if I told you I was worth it would you tell me you won't go?
Lord knows I try but I'm not perfect.
But I told you so. Yes I did you know
And if its all show, then we're already gone.

I've got you on my mind.

You're on my mind
You're on my mind

The end of this road
You'll never know, you'll never know.
And all that we have
We'll never hold, we'll never hold
And somedays I, just can't seem to find
Seem to find
A single way
To get you off my mind.

You're on my mind
You're on my mind
You're on my mind.

You're on my mind
You're on my mind,
And one day when all this travelling has ceased
I will lay my head and rest my feet

When I had you with me
When I had you with me, yeah.
When I had you with me.

Keeping me shaded with my lady.
Never thought a thing about a thing ever back in those days, 
And it's so sad but things they do change.
We've been fussing and fighting since the day we're born, 
Just to get on by and love each other more.
Learning lessons every single second, 
Second guessing our expressions.
Time to let things slide.

Good times

Just keep on rockin' that cool shit, 
Keeping it funky 'cause I dig it.
Making rhythms so slick like the ocean, 
Man you got the blues we got the potion.
Got these hip-hop sneakers on some old time feet, 
Got the same old licks with a brand new beat.
Girls I love the motion that your hosting toasting on the
Microphone, 
Time to get things right.

It's you in the night time sky.

And if I follow you along well then I'll rise up.

CHORUS:
And when the burning sun it falls in my eyes,
Is when I come upon another sunrise.
Well I will walk alone 'cause I'm not scared to die,
On a clearer day in the sunshine.


And when I hear the angels sing down from up above,
Well I won't fear a thing or hear the things I've done.
Only know that you're in a place inside my heart,
And no matter where I go, we will never part.

The Beautiful Girls,"Well I woke up last night, couldn't tell if I was dreaming.
I thought I saw the face of an angel and I heard her speaking to me.
She said my boy, don't fill up your head with trivial things.
'cause life's too beautiful for you to leave.

Just like periscopes up in the sky,
Well I have never seen a girl as beautiful as you, in my whole life.
And things don't always go the way you plan them,
But if your rolling with the flow well then it makes it easier,
Makes it easier to bare.

I'll give you kisses on your neck just like I always promised.
You float into my mind like pictures of an earthly godess.
She said my boy don't fill up your heart with nothing but love.
That truth is truth to you is truth enough.

Root out the photos you've already shown

They're only red from all the things I could have done instead

She'll kiss you or she'll kill you but you'll just have to wait 

Because some things that I do make you go blue 
And something that you said made me go red 

The perfect love has no emotions, it only harbours doubt 
And if she fears your intentions she will cut you out 
So do not raise your voice and do not shake your fist 
Just pass her the carving knife, if that's what she insists 
Insists, if that's what she insists

The Beautiful South,"I once had a friend who I loved from my heart 
But I went on and left her 'fore I'd made a start 
Now I'm moaning the blues like the rest of the charts 
Take me back 

So I'll cry with a limp 
Just get by on a limb 
Till these blue eyes of mine they are closed 
So here's to an old fashioned peck on the cheek 
And farewell my sweet Northern Rose 

Give me one last love song 
To bring you back, bring you back 
Give me one last video, just dressed in black, dressed in black 
Give him a chorus and that bit at the end 
Where he wails on and on 'bout the loss of a friend 
Let him scream loudly 'well this love could mend' 
Let it die, let it die 

Those bloody great ballads we hated at first 
Well I bought them all, now I'm writing worse 
Save us from baldness and saving the earth 
Take me back 

And I'll smile with a limp 
And I'll love with a limp 
Till the clouds disappear from above 
And as the storm moves away all I can say 
Is there's a towel on the door for your love 

Give me one last love song 
To bring you back, bring you back 
Give me one last video, just dressed in black, dressed in black

From the day it came into us till the day it wants to leave
For it will, it will go
And it will not say goodbye just like it didn't say hello
There will not be a send-off, a funeral or mass
Just a pathetic little vodka from a dirty little glass

From the oldest swinger in town'

Let love speak up itself
Let it rise up in the morning and take us for that walk
Let it do the talking when we're too tired to talk
When we're too tired to talk

And when you feel unhappy that I'm not the one I was
Let love rot inside and let love palm you off
Let it rot, let it rot
Let it take your feelings and tie them in a knot
In a knot, in a knot
Let it take your feelings and tie them in a knot

As sweet a young child as you'd find 
Her parents had gone to their final reward 
Leaving their baby behind 

Did you hear this poor little child 
Was only nine years of age 
When mother and dad went away 
Still she bravely worked 
At the one thing she knew 
To earn a few pennies a day 

She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers 
Flowers for ladies of fashion to wear 
She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers 
Fashioned from Annie's despair 

With papers and shears, with wire and wax 
She made up each tulip and mum 
As snow flakes drifted in to her tenement room 
Her baby little fingers grew numb 

From artificial flowers, those artificial flowers 
Flowers for ladies of high fashion to wear 
She made artificial flowers, artificial flowers 
Made from Annie's despair 

And they found little Annie all covered with ice 
Still clutching her poor frozen shears 
Amidst all the blossoms, she had fashioned by hand 
And watered with all her young tears 

There must be a Heaven where little Annie can play 
In heavenly gardens and bowers 
And instead of halo, she'll wear round her head 
A garland of genuine flowers

The maddest things we ever found in bins
He clutches them and looks at you and grins

The children wary of what they may contain
The linen may have changed, the contents same
A trouser-treasure island with no name

And socially at the platform that the timetable forgot
Picking up used tickets in a station of have-nots

You pass some pretty funky stops

A bicycle, a dame, a Christmas tree
Things of no value to you or me

History turns the tall into the small
But natural born trawlers love to trawl

And the guitar of his dreams hangs upon some wall
Or laying underneath the staircase in a hall
We can carry dreams but we can't hold them all
That's why we learn the Blues before we actually fall

So I booked a room next door

So we had to find a bar

Well he couldn't stop drinking
And he couldn't stand on his feet
We had to walk to a hotel
And book ourselves into a suite

Are you from Heaven or are you from Hell
You're from a one star drunken screw
In a one star motel
Yes if the teacher asks you
Are you from Heaven or are you from Hell
You're from a pitch black toilet
In a highway Taco Bell

I'll remember the birth
For the rest of my time on this land

And me holding onto her hand

Just tugging on mescal
Trying to eat the umbilical cord

Miss out on his sweet talk and his blame

The Beautiful South,"Imagine sailing solo around the world
Only to find you've missed a continent out
And as your happy turns choppy and tidal wave swirls
You're wondering why there's no one about

At least Captain Scott actually stood on the spot
Where he planned to put up Union Jack
And though Captain Cook cursed the map that he took
He got near enough for native's attack

That's how it feels trying to navigate you
Even with compass and infinite time
And just when I think I've found some part that's new
I find a flag already up that's not mine

Circling you is journey minus view
Exploration without reason or reward
'Cause when I get near, you use an arrow or spear
To prevent my heart ever being shored

The earth ain't flat but it's a simple doormat
Compared to your unclimbable self
The desolate terrain, you have to cross to your brain
Just one of your slippery shelves

That's how it feels trying to navigate you
Even with compass and infinite time
And just when I think I've found some part that's new
I find a flag already up that's not mine

And if I ever get close, I'll need a banner or post
To hang it from, first there or not

And a friendship that Colombus forgot",Sailing Solo

Perfection like this can't be guaranteed
Hearts get lost, lovers leave
Let's just see what friendship actually needs

And if ever you do wrong I'm right behind you
If ever you may sin, count me in
If that devil doubt should come to find you
Count on me and you don't count on him

If luck should quit this town
If fortune sails
If conversation breaks down
If love derails

I'll be that back up call
If all else fails
I'll swap this bed of roses
For a bed of nails

I wouldn't mind being left up on that shelf
If I hadn't actually built, built the thing myself
But since there's only you and no one else
I don't get too wound up about my health

And if ever shelf may fall I'm right below you
In need of DIY then I'm your guy
If lack of confidence should come to know you
Don't let those tears you cry stop you and I

Leave that door key under the mat
I'm your number one from now on

Set the code, close the door
You don't live there anymore
I'm your number one from now on

Nothing grows so quickly as the vine
That wraps you up so tight and says 'You're mine'
No time so exciting as the time

You pour away that bottle containing last night's wine
Last night's wine, last night's wine
What you're taking part in is the cleverest of crimes
Last night's wine, just a flickering sign
But a necessary sin from time to time

Fold your dress, leave your hair
Put on your jeans, you ain't goin' nowhere
I'm your number one from now on

Cancel the milk, unplug the phone
Close the blinds, you ain't gonna be home
I'm your number one from now on

No time quite so easy as the night
To hold her far too close or far too tight
No catch quite so keen, so quick to bite
Than the one that thinks love's possible first or second sight

Love at first sight, love at first sight
Swinging from the chandelier, it's a one way ticket flight
Love at first sight, so wrong it's right
Swing you by your pigtails, set your world alight

Nothing hooks you quicker than the line
Thrown straight and from the bank into your spine
For family and for friends you'll surely pine
But sentiment and nostalgia, they just ain't worth a dime

What worth's a dime? What worth's a dime?
You can leave those financial worries well behind
What worth's a dime? What worth's a dime?

From Altrincham to Chadderton, it’s rain
From Moss Side to Swinton, hardly Spain
It’s a picture postcard of 'Wish they never came'

And whilst that deckchair in the garden it makes no sense
It doesn’t spoil the view or cause offense
Those Floridas, Bavarias and Kents
Make gentlemen wear shorts but don’t make gents

So convertible stay garage bound
Save after sun for later
If rain makes Britain great
Then Manchester is greater

As you dry your clothes once again
Upon the radiator
What makes Britain great
Makes Manchester yet greater

From Cheetham Hill to Wythenshawe, it’s rain
Gorton, Salford, Sale, pretty much the same
As I’m caught up without my jacket once again
The raindrops on my face play a sweet refrain

And as winter turns reluctantly to spring
For the clouds above the city there’s one last fling
Swallows build their nests, chaffinch sing
And the sun strolls into town like long lost king

So convertible stay garage bound
Save after sun for later
If rain makes Britain great
Then Manchester is greater

As you dry your clothes once again
Upon the radiator
What makes Britain great
Makes Manchester yet greater

And the mood of this whole sodden place is melancholy
Like the sun came out to play, shone through the clouds
But dropped its lolly
And everyone looks so disappointed, so, so sorry
Like the rain blew into town, kidnapped the sun
And stole its brolly

Then Manchester is greater

As you dry your clothes once again

Believe that she decided
When push came to shove, she’d really shove

Couldn’t see the water for the docks

Lost my way up mountain pass
Couldn’t see the signposts for the frost

But I’ve never lost a chicken to a fox

I like that stick thrown into lake

Turns into mistake, your love away
Like that snail on the leaf
You watch as right beneath
That cold hearted thief, your love away

There he stood still hours on
The only movement, the only trace
The position of the gun
And a single tear running down his face

Inside he was screaming
Outside you could barely hear him cry
Inside orchestration
Regulated outside to a sigh

Whatever your situation, whatever it may allow
There's an even larger piece in every lost and found

There is song, there's always a song
Wherever there's perfection there's a wrong
There's always song but a broken bond
And an unkissed frog in every village pond

There's a name that we graffiti'd up on a wall
To the folks who live there now, makes no sense at all
And in every underpass, on every street
A promise someone made but couldn't keep

A tiny piece of chalk in every coat
In every film the smallest lump in throat
In every song you've sung in every novel read

And you’ll know when romance is dead
You’ll burst into tears at each record that’s played
He sits in the sun, you sulk in the shade

You’ll know when romance is dead
From the brambles and thorns growing out of your head
Whenever you touch her she tuts or she sighs
One kiss goodnight and she’s rolling her eyes

And you’ll know when love starts to fade

Like penny stacked high in amusement arcade
It’s not what you’re worth it’s the way that you’re laid
Yes you’ll know when love starts to fade

Like you knew when romance was alive
Each couple you passed they’d smile and high five
Like you’ll know when love’s back on track
Uncontrollable laugh at each joke that you crack

Giggle and cackle and throw her head back
Her mouth is still smiling, her veins turning black
Her head is elastic but her neck is all slack

You’ll know when love’s on the rocks
You wearing headphones, him vest and socks
You’ll know when love’s on the slide
Whenever you’re talking, the kids go outside

You open your mouth but your stories are stale
From front door to back door it’s blowing a gale

Build us lots and lots and lots and lots.

Whistling men in yellow vans
They came and drew us diagrams.
Showed us how it all worked out
And wrote it down in case of doubt.

Slow, slow, quick, quick, quick,
It's wall to wall and brick to brick,
They work so fast it makes you sick,
It's build.

Down with sticks and up with bricks,
In with boots and up with roots,
It's in with suits and new recruits,
It's build...

The Bellamy Brothers,"Well I could apologize but it might be too late for that.
This time you could define it as more than just a lover's spat.
So I'll drink and think about what you told me I could do.
But after I go to hell, can I come on home to you?

I knew that other woman was as poison as they come.
But she flashed that sexy smile at me,
And like a man I acted dumb.
Though she offered me her body, I swear,
I could not go through.
So after I go to hell, can I come on home to you?

Is there something I can say,
Are there any feelings left inside?
Could we just rewind the time,
Before we say goodbye?

I guess there is no explanation that you ain't already heard.
So I'll be headin' down to Hades' to heed your every word.
And I'll walk barefoot on the brimstone,

In his hair he found some gray
But he still ain't changed his lifestyle
He likes it better the old way
So he grows a little garden in the backyard by the fence
He's consuming what he's growing nowadays in self defense
He get's out there in the twilight zone
Sometimes when it just don't make no sense

Yeh he gets off on country music
'Cause disco left him cold
He's got young friends into new wave
But he's just too frigging old
And he dreams at night of Woodstock
And the day John Lennon died
How the music made him happy
And the silence made him cry
Yea he thinks of John sometimes
And he has to wonder why

He's an old hippie
And he don't know what to do
Should he hang on to the old
Should he grab on to the new
He's an old hippie
This new life is just a bust
He ain't trying to change nobody
He's just trying real hard to adjust

He was sure back in the sixties
That everyone was hip
Then they sent him off to Vietnam
On his senior trip
And they force him to become a man
While he was still a boy
And behind each wave of tragedy
He waited for the joy
Now this world may change around him
But he just can't change no more

'Cause he's an old hippie
And he don't know what to do
Should he hang on to the old
Should he grab on to the new

Well he stays away a lot now
From the parties and the clubs
And he's thinking while he's joggin' 'round
Sure is glad he quit the hard drugs
'Cause him and his kind get more endangered everyday
And pretty soon the species
Will just up and fade away
Like the smoke from that torpedo
Just up and fade away

The Bellamy Brothers,"If your sweetheart sends a letter
Of goodbye
It's no secret you feel better
If you cry

When waking from a bad dream
Don't you sometimes think it's real
But it's only false emotions
That you feel

If your heartaches seem to hang around
Too long
And your blues keep getting bluer
With each song

You remember sunshine can be found
Behind the cloudy sky
So let your head down and go on and cry

If your heartaches seem to hang around
Too long
And your blues keep getting bluer

The Bellamy Brothers,"I wanna tell you all a story 'bout a Harper Valley widowed wife,
Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper Valley Junior High,
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play,
And she said.""Mom I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA.""

Well the note said, ""Mrs. Johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinkin' and runnin' round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be a bringin' up your little girl this way.""
And it was signed by the secretary, ""Harper Valley PTA.""

Well it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon
And they were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her mini-skirt into the room
And as she walked up to the black board, I still recall the words she had to say
She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA

Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there, and seven tims he's asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor seems to use a lotta ice, whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep her window shades a pulled completely down

Well Mr. Harper couldn't be here cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me, you think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Peyton Place, and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites

No, I wouldn't put you on because, it really did happen just this way

The Bellamy Brothers,"I knew a man, Bojangles and he danced for you
In worn out shoes
Silver hair, a ragged shirt and baggy pants
The old soft shoe
He jumped so high
He jumped so high
Then he'd lightly touch down
I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was
Down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life
He talked of life
He laughed, clicked his heels and stepped
He said his name, Bojangles and he danced a lick
Across the cell
He grabbed his pants, a better stance
Oh, he jumped so high
Then he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh
He let go a laugh
Pushed back his clothes all around

He danced for those in minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of fifteen years how his dog and him
Traveled about
The dog up and died
He up and died
After twenty years he still grieves
He said I dance now at every chance in honky tonks
For drinks and tips
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
He said I drinks a bit
He shook his head
And as he shook his head
I heard someone ask him please
Please

In his hair he found some gray 
But he still ain't changed his lifestyle 
He likes it better the old way 
So he grows a little garden in the back yard by the fence 
He's consuming what he's growing nowadays in self defense 
He get's out there in the twilight zone 
Sometimes when it just don't make no sense 

He gets off on country music 
'Cause disco left him cold 
He's got young friends into new wave 
But he's just too friggin' old
And he dreams at night of Woodstock and the day John Lennon died 
How the music made him happy and the silence made him cry 
Yeah he thinks of John sometimes 
And he has to wonder why

He's an old hippie and he don't know what to do 
Should he hang on to the old 
Should he grab on to the new 
He's an old hippie...his new life is just a bust 
He ain't trying to change nobody 
He's just trying real hard to adjust 

He was sure back in the sixties that everyone was hip 
Then they sent him off to Vietnam on his senior trip 
And they forced him to become a man while he was still a boy 
And in each wave of tragedy he waited for the joy 
Now this world may change around him 
But he just can't change no more 

He's an old hippie and he don't know what to do 
Should he hang on to the old 
Should he grab on to the new 
He's an old hippie...his new life is just a bust 
He ain't trying to change nobody 
He's just trying real hard to adjust 

Well, he stays away a lot now from the parties and the clubs 
And he's thinking while he's joggin' 'round 
Sure is glad he quit the hard drugs 
'Cause him and his kind get more endangered everyday 
And pretty soon the species will just up and fade away 
Like the smoke from that torpedo...just up and fade away

on the worlds most brilliant minds.

I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.
To hear you whisper low just when it's time to go,
 
Cherie, I love you so, that's my desire.",That's My Desire [Version]
The Belmonts,"She was just sixteen and all alone when I came to be
 So we grew up together, my mama-child and me
 Now things were bad and she was scared but whenever I would cry
 She'd calm my fear and dry my tears
 With a rock and roll lullaby

 And she'd sing
 Sha-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, it'll be all right
 Sha-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, just hold on tight
 Sing it to me, mama
 My, my, my, my mama
 Sing it sweet and clear, oh mama let me hear
 That old rock and roll lullaby

 We made it through the lonely days but, Lord, the nights were long
 And we'd dream of better mornin's when mama sang a song
 Now I can't recall the words at all, it don't make sense to try
 'cause I just knew lotsa love came through
 In that rock and roll lullaby

 And she'd sing
 Sha-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, it'll be all right
 Sha-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, just hold on tight
 I can hear ya, mama
 My, my, my, my mama
 Nothin' moves my soul like the sound of the good old
 Rock and roll lullaby

 Just hold on tight
 My, my, my, my mama
 Nothin' moves my soul like the sound of the good old
 Rock and roll lullaby
",Rock and Roll Lullabye
The Belmonts,"To spend one night with you in our old rendezvous,
And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.
We'll sip a little glass of wine, I'll gaze into your eyes divine.
I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.
To hear you whisper low just when it's time to go,
 
Cherie, I love you so, that's my desire.",That's My Desire
The Belmonts,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happen for the first time
Seem to be happening again
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before
And loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When
The Belmonts,"Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door 
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, why stir up memories

Been invited on dates 
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore",Don't Get Around Much Anymore
The Belmonts,"Come on little angel won't you dance with me,
Well at last I know you know it was plain to see,
We did the Mashed Potato and it sure was fun,
Now ev'rybody wants to see the way it was done, now,
Come on little angel hear the band playing loud,
Turn around see them forming a crowd,
And now, little angel, now that you're in the groove
You hear them all a-clapping as we both start to move.
Now, come on, come on little angel, come on,
Come on little angel, come on.
Come on little angel, come on, come on.

Come on little angel now the lights are down low,
It's really getting late and we have to go,
Well thank you little angel for that wonderful kiss
And now you're gonna tell me that you're doing the Twist.

Around and around and up and down,
Around and around and up and down,
Around and around and up and down,
Around and around and up and down.

Yes, little angel, it sure is fun,
Ev'ry time we're dancin' she's a-right on time.
She moves to the left, she moves to the right,
She feels the beat and she dances all the night.

Why don't you come on little angel now the lights are down low,
It's really getting late and now we have to go,
Well thank you little angel for that wonderful kiss
And now you're gonna tell me that you're doing the Twist.

Around and around and up and down",Come on Little Angel [Alternate Take 14]
The Belmonts,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
The Belmonts,"This love of mine goes on and on, 
Though life is empty since you have gone 
You're always on my mind, though out of sight, 
It's lonesome through the day, 
But oh! the night
I cry my heart out, it's bound to break, 
Since nothing matters, let it break
I ask the sun and the moon, 
The stars that shine, 
What's to become of it, 
This love of mine",This Love of Mine
The Beloved,"The autumn of this winter
I've forgotten how to breathe
Made my mind up three times or more
Simple life of make-believe
My head was in the clouds
Feet nailed to the floor
My right hand held the hammer
Left knows what my right hand's for
But I'm still waiting
It seems to me
I spend my whole life anticipating

But when I laugh, when I smile
I could leap tall buildings, run a mile
I laugh and then I smile

I have a house and children
I have everything I need
Voice concern but I don't complain
Remember I've four mouths to feed
But I'm still waiting
And it seems to me that I've
Spent my whole life anticipating

When I laugh and smile
I could leap tall buildings, run a mile

I'm much too headstrong for my own good.
I'm too involved to realize
That your uncertainty will be the death of me.
But I lose my will and if looks could kill,
I've been struck down dead by your beautiful eyes.

I know that I'm impossible and deceiving.
I see the signs, you're telling me that you're leaving.
Time after time...
Time after time...
These games of politics and romance, they're quite impossible to win.
I can't unfathom you;
One minute you love me or you say you do
And then I turn my back, I'm under attack,
I turn to hold you and you stick me for nothing.

And if I change to be the way you say you want me,
I'll only be the way I've always wanted to.

Come on, sugar, let me know.
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me.
Come on, honey, tell me so.

He's acting shy, looking for an answer.
Come on, honey, let's spend the night together.
Now, hold on a minute before we go much further.
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother.
They catch a cab to his high-rise apartment.
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant.

I trust my own rules and I trust my own way
Don't judge me by the way I feel
My thoughts are genuine my life is real
I don't know why I don't make a big deal
Sometimes I wish I could run away

When I wake up every morning
Every single day
The sun is still shining but my sky's still gray
And I don't know what to think
Everything that's been said and taught to me
Fades away like a somber symphony
And I don't know how to feel
I listen to what I've been told before,
But it doesn't seem to work anymore
And I don't know what to do

Sleepless nights and hopeless dreams
Out of reach is how things seem
And I don't know what to think
Another time, another place
Having thoughts I can't erase
And I don't know how to feel
Just hold on, I'll meet you there
It'll work this time I swear
And I don't know what to do

The Berlin Project,"I hide my plans to build the planes,
The traffic's scarce so I'll go out and brave it.
I'll walk into my hallway, the living room and out the door I'll save it
And I'll make it.
It's not that far and it won't be long,
Until the day's not wasted anymore.
But motivation lacks temptation
And soon that void will disappear.
I waste my life at 3 am,
That's the only time when I'm awake.
The television is my best friend,
And the living knows that it will break,
It's just fate.
It's not that far and it won't be long,
Until the day's not wasted anymore.
But motivation lacks temptation
And soon that void will disappear.
Searching for the answers that I may never find,
There's nothing left for me to do,
So I'll just play Sweet Child O' Mine.
People act so different now,
The friends I used to have I know just fake it.
Maybe I'll come back someday,
Where everything will be just like I made it,
So I'll take it.
It's not that far and it won't be long,
Until the day's not wasted anymore.
But motivation lacks temptation
And soon that void will disappear.
Searching for the answers that I may never find,
There's nothing left for me to do,
So I'll just jump back in this life.
Searching for the answers that I may never find,
There's nothing left for me to do,
So I'll just end with this sweet bass line.

The Berzerker,"Always living on the line of what you think is right or wrong,
there was a time when even i could not bear to be alone,
needing someone or something that is not mine to call my own,
to have and hold,
severing the only line of trust that you once thought you had,
now that i can see past you i can start to be a man,
death to me seems no mistake for i have yet to hate,
so can you see my pain, can you feel my pain, can you see my...
this, is my world,
and i see, what you don't,
forever, wanting more,
life breathes, from our soul,
looking into bloodshot eyes mesmerized they can't look back,
slowly turning in my mind is the visions of your death,
finding truth amongst my lies but not accepting now i grow,
and gain control,
opening to inner sanctums that you do not understand,
having no respect for life and taking it with my bare hands,
always searching with contempt for ways to rid my pounding head,
from this place,
This, is my world,
and i see, what you don't,
forever, wanting more,
life breathes, from our souls.

The Berzerker,"The uncreative juices flow from all but a selective few
and even those they tend to be wasted,
you have taken pride in a lifeform that you think you know
but what you do not know is it's rotting,
it is so unfortunate that this is how our world must be
but why must i accept reality, is this reality?
how can i exist amongst you people when i feel this way
when all that seems so wrong is everywhere,
A world without substance feeling so superior
i am discontent with lies and with ineffective lives,
should i grieve for mankind or live out my life
to be free of pain i'll want it back again,
so to be one with man i must be false to myself
any effort's futile for my life is just mine,
i have visions of worlds that are unparalleled
my attempts are in vain to walk this earth without shame, 
for being human,
This is my reality and you do not have to accept it
you are only human with excuses and complaints,
couldn't you be something greater come on now you know the answer
you are so absorbed with your own pathetic lives,
why should i feel pity for you i don't think i know the answer,
have you ever thought about opening your closed eyes,
what is it that you're afraid of, don't you want to see yourself,
couldn't bear to see yourself as i see you.

I had his eyes on the grapefruit tree

????? around and I sat on a stool
Somebody said to me
They said how-diddly-do to you little boy
Would you like ????? get you some ??????

???? a time you can come on home
???????????????????
Somebody hear to me in the holy light
????? by your eyes and get high on the wire
????? by your eyes and get high on the wire
????? by your eyes and get high on the wire
????? by your eyes and get high on the wire
????? by your eyes and get high on the wire
????? by your eyes and get high on the wire

Sucked up my room that's in the ?????
Fucked up my life that's in the glue pot
And I ran down the road
Kicked my shoes in the air
And I
Tripped and fell in the dogshit

Tonight I stayed home by the phone
Talking to the person's unknown
Take me to another zone
This is my life on the phone

Well I feel like Donald Duck
Sold my eyes for an once of luck
And now my backs on fire, my burning wire
The people upstairs don't scream so high

So I decided to fly off again and flew up really high
Away up on the crest out of sight
As I was taking off I was for the first time aware
That the people might see me taking off and land and fool around generally

I felt real numb ? everyone so I sat quite sad and sombre
I felt real numb ? everyone so I sat quite sad and sombre

Flying away from the site on the motorway
Quite high so we decided to head back
From the ticket office on the edge of the site
Said they couldn't make it for myself so we ain't gonna fly

In previous dreams I felt ?
But sometimes ? restrictions on my arms
And flap a little hands in the case of the dream
Didn't work so a superman dream
I couldn't do it in the superman style
So I tried flying off to Glasgow
Where I was flying somewhere in style on the M8
And I got caught more and more so I came lower and lower
So I don't think I wanna do couldn't fly anymore
Landed on the car where a women saw me
Suddenly appeared on the car but she couldn't carry anything
She walked down the street but she ?
I want small shop ?
In the shop was two small ?
Then I saw a porch bit
Suddenly I realised I was in someone's house
And I left and that's all I'm gonna be remembering for right now

I get an opposite reaction in my mind

The Beta Band,"I'm going totally round the bend
I don't wanna see my friends
I don't wanna see my mad friend
Cause he's driving me insane
I don't wanna see my friends
I'm going totally round the bend
Earlier on today I tried to walk down the street
But my feet kept slipping on the pavement

I found myself at ninety degrees to the rest of the world
It's not much fun you take it from me
I'm not having too good a time
There's people worse off than me,
Don't think I don't realise that but
I'm going round the bend again the last thing I wanna do
Is see my friends again
I'm going quietly round the bend again

I try to function as a normal human being
I washed my car earlier on this evening
And now I'm trying to get it together
To cook a little meal
Before I go for a drink with my friends
But I got no food I got no time to go to the supermarket
It's not that I couldn't make time
It's more that I get confused when I get there
People walking past, see the green tray outside
They see a nice little flat imagine a person inside
He's having a great old time
Well I wish I was having a greater time
Than they could possibly imagine that I'm having
All I wanna do is go far away and see things I've never seen before
I like the pyramids they weren't built in a day y'know
? pyramids don't fit the equation

But I'm so paranoid I can't even make it to the supermarket
Let alone go to Egypt and see my favourite pyramid

I go round to Robin's and try and eat some food there
Sometimes its better if you're in the company of a man
He's just said he's had a glass of red wine
So why am I had mine
I listened to The Beach Boys just a minute ago, Wild Honey
It's not the best album but its still pretty good
They've got some funny little love songs on there
It's not really a Brian's production
So its probably not as good as something like Pet Sounds

I'm going totally round the bend
Don't wanna see my friends again
I just wanna be left alone
And never bothered ever again

Never again, ever again
Ever again",Round the Bend

Lyrics: 
The people asking questions to the people with the answers 
The people with the answers ire the people with the questions 
So the people with the questions asked the people with the answers 
The people with the answers won't tell the people with the questions the answers 

So the people with the questions they ask the people with the answers 
But the people with the answers won't speak to them 
Because the people with the answers give the people with the questions 
just a little bit too hard a time to speak to 

I'm a man who likes to be alone 
I'm a man who likes to think alone 
I don't have too many answers, but I got a whole heap of questions 
I got a whole heap of questions that I won't hide from you 

So low, don't smile you get high [?] 

So the people with the books they went and stood up on the mountain 
To get away from the people with no books 
The people with the books they started reading on the mountain but 
they couldn't see a thing because the sky went dark 
I don't know where the cloud cover came from 
I'm just sitting here rocking on the station 

I don't want to be the type of guy 
who lives alone, reading books, and never eats a pizza pie 
I don't want to be the type of person sitting alone with a book on my own 

With a book on my own 

The people with the questions got together 
with the people with the books and left the people with answers out 
So the people with the answers started to make their way over the hill 
to meet with people with the questions and the people with the books 

And we all live together on a little round ball 
We all sing together when the cuckoo calls 

I'm not the type best living alone 
Could we live together? Well, I don't know.. 

I'm not sitting here giving you a lesson 
So I?ll just keep my mouth shut for the next few minutes 

Can't keep quiet for long 
I'm a human being 
Can't help help singing this song 
I'm a human being 

You won't listen to me 
I'm not an authority 

So the people with the answers met the people with the questions 
and the people with the books sat down 
They finally decided to sit around to talk about their problems 
to see if they come up with some answers to meet the questions 
and some questions to meet the answers 

well, the leaves on the trees are green 
[ok we're agreed on that] 
and the roads are not very clean 
[ok we're agreed on that] 
and the food we eat is not very healthy 
[ok we're agreed on that] 
and the music we make is not particularily good 
[ok we're agreed on that] 
and the planets sort of revolve around the sun 
[ok we're agreed on that] 
and the moon is a big ball with nothing on it, and I don't think anyone's ever been there 
[ok, so we're kind of agreed to that, so what are we arguing about? 
Well, I don't know.. 
Ok. so let?s get together and smoke that pizza pie] 

Some people with a pizza pie made me very high 
The people with the questions smile 
And the people with the answers lie 
They lie 

So no pizza for them

will you think of me when I'm gone?

Swore me on Friday

What's going through her mind
When she's looking the me
If all the things I've said right now
For both of us came true
Nobody would look for me
When I disappear in you
And it's never very clear just who's in control
It's all so beautiful what's the point of it all

I only want to count the days
To say we made another day

The last day of my November
I heard her distant valiant song
Which beg me to remember

The frazzled track of mayonnaise daze
Her voice was far and faded
Reminding me how sudden she changed
And cut off her cascading

The force of years has blown me away
And seasons time may drown me
And tho it left with stable in head
I feel it wrapped round me

The Bhundu Boys,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
The Big 3,"Roses love sunshine, violets love dew
Angels in heaven know I love you
Know I love you, love, know I love you
Angels in heaven know I love you

If you don't love me, love whom you please
Throw your arms round me, give my heart ease
Give my heart ease, love, give my heart ease
Throw your arms round me, give my heart ease

Build me a castle, forty feet high
So I can see her as she rides by
As she rides by, love, as she rides by
So I can see her as she rides by

The Big 3,"Daddy, daddy, come and look
See what I have found
A little ways away from here
While digging in the ground

Come away melinda
Come in and close the door

They had before the war

Daddy, daddy, come and see
Daddy, come and look
Why, theres four or five
Little melinda girls
Inside my picture book

Before they had the war

Daddy, hurry do
Why, theres someone
In a pretty dress
Shes all grown up like you
Wont you tell me why

Come away melinda

Why cant things be

The Big Apple Chorus,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura

Hey there Little Red Riding Hood
You sure are lookin' good

I don't think little big girls should
Go walkin' in these spooky old woods alone

The kind of eyes that drive wolves mad
So, just to see that you don't get chased
I think I ought, to walk, with you for a ways

What full lips you have
They're sure to lure, someone bad
So, untill you get to grandma's place
I think you ought, to walk, with me and be safe

I'm gonna keep my sheep suit on
Till I'm sure that you've been shown
That I can be trusted walkin' with you alone

I'd like to hold you if I could
But you might think I'm a big bad wolf, so I won't

What a big heart I have
The better to love you with

The Big Bopper,"Well in North Carolina, way back in the hills

Well I asked my old pappy why he called his brew
White lightning 'stead of mountain dew
I took a little sip and right away I knew
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
Lightning started flashin' and thunder started crashin' 
Shhhoooh... white lightnin'

Well a city slicker came and he said ""I'm tough""
I think I want to taste that powerful stuff
He took one g-g-glug and drank it right down

I've seen the lights of this city go out at night
Instant living rarely works out right
You never turned down what you wanted to be
It's a kind of magic that you can't help but feel

I dreamt we were sleeping and we floated away
And we shone like a star and we blinded who stared
We listen to the heavens at the silence above
Never ask the devil to help the one that you love
You said to me baby that you want to feel love
Babe we gave it our all but its never enough

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
The Billys,"The devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you 

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

He played Fire on the Mountain run boys, run
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in a bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No child, no

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back
If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been""

The Bird and the Bee,"You broke some bones when we were young
I can remember how you moaned
So I carried you home like a baby

You were thirteen and I was twelve
I can remember how it felt
Wearing your broken body on like a lady

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
If ever you need me
Just call me, I'll carry you home
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
If ever you're broken
No reason to do it alone

We were both five, you started a fire
And for a moment, all was lost
But then the rain fell from the sky
It was magic

Couldn't believe how it came down
Puddles of water all around
But when the clouds were finally gone
It seemed tragic

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
If ever you need me
Just call me, I'll carry you home
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
If ever you're broken
No reason to do it alone

Baby, I know we've seen our share
Of hard times, you and me
But I want you to know that I will always
No matter what, come to you

Out of the mist or into the fire
Across the sea, the mountains, the desert
And if you need me, just call me
And I will carry you all the way home

There's nothing left to hide you away
Just show a little bit of brain

Yes that is what I mean
That's the nail that I hit
I try to be as coy as I can
But I wanna see your naughty bit

Would you please, would you please
Would you, would you please

You thought you had it down, but then you ran back to the center
What's in a word if that word has lost its meaning
If you say it all the time a dirty word will get its cleaning

Where is the end is the edge of understanding

Give me a push a little push in one direction
I might need a little help with my own interconnection

In the night, we dance with our devils and dine with the snakes.
The dead will stare in joy and despair 
Rising up, away from the earth, into the clouds.

From the eye of the Graeae we stole,
A truth that we can’t unknow.
Spinning on the threads they sew
In a river of the tears that flow into the world below.

Over, under, threads of fate.
Weaving patterns, soon and late.
As in this life, so in all things
The end result, the action brings.

The fates will divide in three.

The Birthday Massacre,"From the ocean, we were washed up on the other shore
We didn't know where we'd been, or who we were before
We were two brothers and a sister with three poison hearts
We walked so close together, but our souls were always far apart

A slight of hand, a flash of light
Our seasick days and homesick nights
When tomorrow comes, there'll be no end in sight

The dreams of blood devotion follow us here
These tears run into the ocean as we disappear

Underneath the mountain, we took shelter from the storm
When the skies had cleared, we chased our shadows North
We drew a circle in the ashes where we fell asleep
We dreamed about tomorrow and the secret we would always keep

A slight of hand to make us blind
Our past life shared, we left behind
When tomorrow comes, there'll be no end in sight

The dreams of blood devotion follow us here
These tears run into the ocean as we disappear

Home is something I'll never know
It's where I wanted to go

Saw some kind of new light

It's over time at ring side, no lie

March me down to the seven seas
Bury me with a ruby ring
Kiss me baby on an Easter Sunday day
Make my haze blow away

I hide I seek and I find
Truth in a fable faith in a rhyme
So why you want to bad talk me
Are you surprised by what we see?
Like the tables and the tides turn
On my bed the emperor worn
Is that enough for me, could be

Just let it go cause you never know, you never know
If your rhythm ever falls out of time

Under her sweater and before she
reads she straightens her blouse

lost your address

Never paid attention to you

He left his needle outside in the rain
And it rusted through
He had twenty-nine blackbirds
But only one flew
Spent most of his time making holes
And licking his wounds

She took her diamond rings and was
Gone before the light
She left one satin shoe and a
Very dull knife
She left one satin shoe and a very dull knife

Written from a cold place
I feel sour I need a shower
Or just a slap in the face
Circumstance has left romance
And a puzzle in front of me
Who knows the ending, if the truth need
Bending, A lie is the tool that you'll need

So I'm under a mountain
Stuck to this mattress
Perfume and Valium

What makes a Sunday different from Monday
Could be a look in her eyes
In need of flattery she changes batteries
So that her light will shine
The words she utters either so flows or
Stutters
They're either silly or wise
Anger with concern
But never to yearn
Only to be by your side

Lay down with number 13
Its a cold gray shame",Under a Mountain

Welcome to the good times honey
Did you bring your own parade?
Welcome to the big time baby
Time for a serenade

Did you say you lost your pride?
You tried to hide
But you're not strong enough
To ever get away

And it only goes to show
What we all know
That the tables will surely turn
For you one day

Welcome to the good times honey
Did you bring your own parade?
Welcome to the big time baby
Time for a serenade
Well let's go

Na na na na na na na

It should come as no surprise
Just realize, that when it all comes down
Who is really on your side
Tell me

Welcome to the big time baby
Time for a serenade

The Black Crowes,"I lose myself,
I forget myself,
Sometimes I fault myself,
Yes, and I might fight myself,
But then I make amends

I freeze myself,
I rain on myself,
OK, so I stoned myself,
I might even find myself,
But then what happens if I do?
So unzip my pride, baby open me up wide,
So I can show this to you

I want to shine for you,
Babe, I want to sparkle too,
Just like a diamond cursed,
You love it don't get no worse,
You know that I'll save you time,
You jump around and smile,
Hold me baby, hold me close,
Hold me girl, and I will laugh with you,
I will laugh with you only if you want me to,
Hold me in your splendor,
I'll envy your surrender,
And show me victory

Well I hate myself,
And everybody hates themselves,
So I scare myself,
It's alright, I tell myself that it's all in my mind,
So let the poison go,
Cause baby I'll always know, you'll be there for me

I want to shine for you,
Babe I want to sparkle too,

Slow down for me
I'm friendly and I'm clean

The Black Crowes,"I'll fetch you water from the well, if you sweep all the ashes out into the wind.
Because we sit by candle light again, two moths that hover close to the light of morning.

[Chorus]
And how you made this cold boy smile.
From the storm you took me weathered, wearied and tired.
You showed me the lessons of simple things.
How love made this cold boy sing.

Some say that love is the poem of life.
Some say that love is the pain of being alive.
Some say that there's nothing on the other side.
Some have traded their souls for just a good time.

The closer I get to you the more I can't wait.
Roll on down here; smell my brakes.
No time for coffee, just splash water on my face.
Kick my tires, count out-of-state plates.
Roll down my window, don't the wind feel great.
Sunrise my friend, sunset again.
The song I keep humming while my four wheels are spinning.
Another road, another road, another roadside tragedy.

Wind it down and back it up.
I might get there sooner than I thought
No warranty or no wear and tear
It don't matter just as long as I get there.

Won't you help me to plant the seed

And if it grows
Yes, we'll know, oh we'll know

Sent down to help me fly away
If I found you a floating feather
I would be amazed

Death cold has got your skin
