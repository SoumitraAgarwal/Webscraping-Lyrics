Josh Kelley,"I could fall in love with you
But it's not my fault
'Cause you are the prettiest thing I've seen
When you're fallen asleep in my arms
Oh my, oh my, oh my

So just stay awake for me
'Cause I can't fall asleep
So just stay awake for me
I'll give you anything
To just stay awake, make love to me

So myabe all you'll ever need
Is right inside these arms
Whole and you're so dam tired and conditional
As you're fallen asleep in the dark
Oh I, oh my, oh my

So just stay awake for me
'Cause I can't fall asleep
So just stay awake for me
I'll give you anything
To just stay awake, make love to me

There's nothing I won't try
To keep your body close to mine
And baby hold on tight
It's a will open ride
Give me all you got tonight
And stay awake with me, stay awake

Give it all you got

So just stay awake for me
'Cause I can't fall asleep
So just stay awake for me
I'll give you anything
To just stay awake, make love to me
Oh, just stay awake make love to me

Make love to me
Make love to me
Make love to me",Stay Awake
Josh Kelley,"Seems to me that you only want me when you're happy, are you happy? Or are we just wasting time. I'll make it easy, if you stay or you leave me, I'm still gonna try.
Still gonna try
Ooooooo
Still gonna try
Ooooooo
Still gonna try
Ooooooo

Every once in a while, I catch myself in the same ol' denial. I hold my breath for a moment where I can forget you're gone.

Seems to me, you wanna ignore me when you have me, do you have me? I think its time to decide. There must be a reason that I can't stop believin' that one day you'll leave me behind. 
But I'm still gonna try
Ooooooo
Still gonna try 
Ooooooo
Still gonna try 
Ooooooo

Every once in a while, I catch myself in the same ol' denial. I hold my breath for a moment where I can forget you're gone.

Still gonna try
Still gonna try
Still gonna try
Still gonna try
Still gonna try

Seems to me that you only want me when you're happy, are you happy?
",Still Gonna Try
Josh Kelley,"It just stormed into my life like a hurricane coming
Spinning around like a devil from horns to toes
I was so damn comfortable till you jumped in my ocean
I may not understand you but I'm learning as I go

I'm just around the corner child, everything's changed
I didn't see you coming but I, I love you anyway
I want to give you something to take, to take away the pain
I'm just ripples in your ocean, you're my tidal wave

I've given up on yesterdays on a lonely situation
Pushing down on a pedal, I'm gonna catch your storm
Oh, you're so irresistible with your big imagination
Well tie me up, mess around with me in your arms

I'm just around the corner child, everything's changed
I didn't see you coming but I, I love you anyway
I want to give you something to take, to take away the pain
I'm just ripples in your ocean, you're my tidal wave

You'll find me 'cause I want you, oh, I gotta have you
Yes please please, it's kinda crazy what you do to me
Oh and I just can't seem to get enough

I'm just around the corner child, everything's changed
I didn't see you coming but I, I love you anyway
I want to give you something to take, to take away the pain
I'm just ripples in your ocean, you're my tidal wave

I'm just ripples in your ocean, you're my tidal wave
Oh, I'm just swimming in your ocean, you're my tidal wave
",Tidal Wave
Josh Kelley,"Yeah hey, yeah hey
Yeah hey, yeah hey

Two cups of coffee in the mornin'
Two days till I stop feelin' blue
Two chairs, one empty in the corner
I got too much me and not enough of you
I got too much me and not enough of you

Two thousand miles away I'm boardin'
Two crazy people next to me
Two shots of vodka I am pourin'
I got too much me and not enough of you
I got too much me and not enough of you

Hold on tight, hold on tight
Because the ship is sailin'
One more night till I can lie into my lady
Precious lady, alright, alright

One day we are gonna get married, married
One day I'll show you how I do, I do, baby, oh, baby, uh
One love is all this heart is yearnin' for
I got too much me and not enough of you
I got too much me and not, too much me and not enough of
Too much me and not enough of you

Well, anyway
Yeah hey, yeah hey

Oh, I got too much me and not enough
Oh, I got too much me and not enough of you, baby, baby
Baby, I got too much of me and not enough of you
I'm gonna hold you, darlin?

Oh hey, hey, baby, I got too much of me
I love you, gonna hold you, darlin', yeah hey
Love you, love you

One day we are gonna get married

Josh Kelley,"You find it hard to sleep 'cause when you close your eyes
You still got her picture hanging on your mind
You wish you didn't need what you just can't have
But there ain't nothing you can do

There's not a second that you don't think about her
But she don't even think one single thought of you

Why does love got to be so unfair?
Making your heart see something that's just not there
Why does love got to be so unkind?
Making you hurt so bad, no, it's just not right
Why does love got to be so unfair?
Oh, why does love got to be so unfair, baby?

It's such a sad affair when you give your heart
And the one you give it to just goes and tears it all apart
You wish you didn't care, didn't care at all
But all you do is care too much

It's not a single night you don't dream about her
When you're the very last thing she'll be dreaming of

Why does love got to be so unfair?
Making your heart see something that's just not there
Why does love got to be so unkind?
Making you hurt so bad, no, it's just not right
Why does love got to be so unfair?

Oh, it's a sad fact, it's the cold hard truth
Sometimes you're gonna learn that love is cruel
Sometimes you're gonna find out
Gonna find the one you love just don't love you, oh

Why does love got to be so unfair?
Making your heart see something that's just not there
Why does love got to be so unkind?
Making you hurt so bad, no, it's just not right
Why does love, oh, why does love got to be so unfair?

Why does love got to be so unfair?
Making your heart see something that's just not there
Why does love got to be so unkind?
Making you hurt so bad, no, it's just not right
Why does love got to be so unfair?
",Unfair
Josh Kelley,"Oh I?m sorry 
I?m sorry for the way that I?ve been acting
Just know it?s hard to be 
Everything that everyone wants to me to be
You know I?m working on it
Yeah I?m working on it
Giving it a real good try

Back in 93, I decided I could be most anything
Living wild and free 
Strong and hard as I could on those guitar strings
Yeah I?m working on it
Everyday I?m working on it
Giving it a real good try

Yeah I?m working on it
Working hard on it
So baby don?t worry your mind

When I feel like givin? up
It?s so nice to have you by my side baby
Cause times they do get rough
When it ain?t enough
Just to be satisfied

Yeah I?m working on it
Giving it a real good try

I?m giving it a real good try
So baby don?t worry your mind
And give me just a little bit more time
",A Real Good Try
Josh Kelley,"If you want me and I want you
We should just open up the doors and 
Walk right in 
Walk right in 

Let?s live in this moment for a second 
Two hearts plotting out the course
To walk right in 
We should just walk right in 

If there?s a million ways you can justify your love
I can be the one tonight
Let me be the one tonight
Simple chemistry?s all we?ll ever need for the freedom to decide

Standing still in hesitation
We?re frozen for fear of obligations of fall in love
Do we need to fall in love?

As I walk to you, I see your body shiver
Shaking, the urge to put my hands 
Upon your skin 
Let me walk right in 

There?s a million ways you can justify your love
I can be the one tonight
Let me be the one tonight
Simple chemistry?s all we?ll ever need for the freedom to decide

Walk right in 
Let me walk right in 

There?s a million ways you can justify your love
I can be the one tonight
Let me be the one tonight
I can be the one tonight
Let me be your one tonight
Simple chemistry?s all we?ll ever need for the freedom to decide
",Walk Right in
Josh Kelley,"She poses for the camera
She's my little cover girl
If you tell her she's a pretty bird
She flies around the world
Still gets nervous when I kiss her
But that don't mean she's shy
Man you ought to see it
When she gets that look

In her baby blue eyes
Baby blue eyes
Oh I love the man she makes me
Every day that woman saves me
With her baby blue eyes
Baby blue eyes
There's somethin' 'bout
There's somethin' 'bout
There's somethin' 'bout her baby blue eyes

The first time that I met her
I couldn't say a word
She knew what I was thinking
And I'm not sure how it worked
'Cause I know I don't deserve her
I would never break her heart
I knew it when she had me
And she had me from the start

With her baby blue eyes
Baby blue eyes
When she wants me she can have me
Yeah she owns me when she asks me
With her baby blue eyes
Baby blue eyes
There's somethin' 'bout
There's somethin' 'bout
There's somethin' 'bout her baby blue eyes, oh eyes

I used to think love was just a word
I never thought time would heal the hurt
And then you walked straight in my life
An angel in disguise
With baby blue eyes, oh

Her baby blue eyes
Baby blue eyes
Oh I love the man she makes me
Every day that woman saves me
With her baby blue eyes
Baby blue eyes, I know
There's somethin' 'bout
There's somethin' 'bout
There's somethin' 'bout her baby blue
There's somethin' 'bout
There's somethin' 'bout

Josh Kelley,"Can't you see it in my eyes, I'm saying
Don't you go
So many reasons you should stay here baby
Don't you go, don't you go
Can't you feel it in my fingertips
In the way I hold you when we kiss
If you wanted, we could stay like this forever

Don't you go
You can save your plans for another time
Stay here baby and be mine
Don't you know
This is the only place we need to be right now
Don't you go

The bed's still warm and it's still waiting
Don't you go
To watch you leave would drive me crazy
Don't you go, don't you go
It may be selfish baby but I can't help
That I want you all to myself
I wanna lay you down so we can melt together

Don't you go
You can save your plans for another time
Stay here baby and be mine
Don't you know
This is the only place we need to be right now
Don't you go

Let me show you how I love you
Can't believe how much I need you
Baby there ain't nothing I won't do for you
Turn around, come back to me
Close the door and drop the keys
Every part of me is begging please

Don't you go
You can save your plans for another time
Stay here baby and be mine
Don't you know
This is the only place we need to be right now
Don't you go

Oh, this is the only place we need to be right now
Don't you go",Don't You Go
Josh Kelley,"Why she had to look so beautiful
Why she had to pick this place?
I hope she brought and explanation
I hope she doesn't look my way

'Cause it would be hard to say hello to her
When she never said goodbye
It would take every bit of, I've gained to knock it lost
In those eyes

Oh but I can't take another gone like that
Take another hurt so bad that
I can't breathe, I can't sleep, don't wanna eat
And I won't take another way she go in
Take another all alone
Man I want her back, but I can't take another gone like that
I can't take another gone like that, no

She came up on me like a flood
She wiped out everything I knew
Now just barely water, last thing I need to do
As a reach for you,
Oh but I can't take another gone like that

Can't take another hurt so bad that

I can't breathe, I can't sleep, don't wanna eat
And I won't take another way she go in
Take another all alone
Man I want her back, but I can't take another gone like that
I can't take another gone like that, no

Now she's walking my direction, I might be lonely
And this is tempting
Oh now I can't take another gone like that
Can't take another hurt so bad that
I can't breathe, I can't sleep, I can't even eat
And I won't take another way she go in
Take another all alone
Man I want her back, but I can't take another gone
Yes some times I want her back
But I can't take another gone like that
No, I can't take another gone like that
I can't take another gone, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no yeah, yeah, wo whooo",Gone Like That
Josh Kelley,"My, oh my, how long it's been
You look just like you did back then
All we need is a sunset, Springsteen and an old Chevette
We're right back on that riverbank
Down a long dirt road on an empty tank
First love, first anything
That moon saw everything
Does it take you back
Say baby, does it make you think

Is that a good memory or a great idea
Do we just reminisce or get outta here
Back to when you called me baby
Slow and softly in my ear
Is that a good memory or a great idea
Is that a great idea

I can see your bedroom window now
Easin' up and you sneakin' out
Scared to death of your old man
If he'd a caught us, we'd both be dead
It ain't no doubt you looked real fine
As I recall, you weren't real shy
Tank-top and cut-off jeans
You knew how to get to me
Does it take you back
Tell me baby, does it make you think

Is that a good memory or a great idea
Do we just reminisce or get outta here
Back to when you called me baby
Slow and softly in my ear
Is that a good memory or a great idea

You had no idea that you were my girl.

Catch a whiff and get high, on a spliff, yes I…

I'm talking better than dope and I really like dope
And so it must be good, could it get any better?
Shoulda set the sun off with a nice cool breeze,
To ease the sweet smell of sweat run off, so please come off.

You feel me like a breeze blowing, sitting under trees writing,
Liking looking out at the seas and fallen leaves,
And breathing in the change of season, I don't even need a reason
To be boozing when I'm cruising, as long as shit is pleasing.

I love seeing the sun coming into my cave,
And still crave the haze and find so many ways to misbehave.
See the josh did done that, and still caught the sunset
Drunk as fuck screaming “are we having fun yet?”

See the josh did done that,
And still caught the sunset,

How we always need to borrow
Loot to get loose,

Verse 2:
Look out on the water and watch the sun setting
You can smell the rum and coke and you can see that some forgetting,
Come the summer ends in smoke soaking up all them rays
It'll end in autumn leaves, smoking trees on rainy days.

The greens of today are the browns of tomorrow
And yesterday's sorrow is the legacy we follow
In the yesteryears, the X amount of beers we quenched our fears with,
Were forgotten like so many friends we went and spilled our tears with.

To me the seas are calling, see I've fallen into love
With ska, dub and the dope dancehall.
It seized me by the collar and it hollered you've been mollycoddled long enough.
Are you man enough? Are you strong enough?

The world is yours but your divorced from it.
So close to the top and you haven't seen the summit.
Been talking and dreaming for so long and ain't done it.
When the prey becomes the predator, the dream becomes the hunted.

Man I'm missing sitting kissing, talking shit, and pissing wine.
Getting sunk feeling, remember reeling drunk and drooling time
ON life I'm buzzing nicely, maybe it might be caused
By laws that aren't likely to have teeth, let alone jaws

Each and every leech that has a cause is always preaching
A one-sided thesis that comes from flawed teaching.
Smoking pot to pass the time, what a crock I'm past my prime.
But where's the clock that's telling time, when I'm the rock that time forgot.

Not ready to go steady, not into the petty.
The pity parties and confetti…I been there already.
I can be your man if you'd only understand
That I can't be held down by nothing just yet.

I don't care about the money, shit, I wanna live right too.
But one plus one equals none left for me to like you.
If you want it, you got it, you break it you bought it.
You thought it would be cool to play the fool, you've been spotted.

You break it you bought it.

If you know what you want to say oh I wanna hear you say it.
If you know where you wanna go an how far, do you wanna take it

And voices tell to be hold
Upon the wreckage lies soul
That knows the path to fields of gold,

Bare footed, all draped out in linens
Repentended, I lived though sacrifice
And now I wait my eternal residence in paradise
I walk the righteous path through the garden of eden with the enlightened mind I got from the knowledge of readin'
Hard to believe I achieve through the devine intervention
I’m a soldier I’ll be standing on the day of redemption

We all wanna make progress, and we sufferin' runnin' in circles again
The only reason that I stand to make it through
Is that I'm twice the man I am when I'm with you

Tryna make a change, going down a different avenue
If anytime I stop, at least I know where I am heading to
So won't ya, join the revolution cuz I been missing you

The only reason that I stand to make it through
Is that I'm twice the man I am when I'm with you

Money left to burn, we can do whatever
Ain't you know that I'm a boss? Check my Kelsey Grammer
Stank attitude but she smilin' when we kiss
But I love my baby mama, cuz she do not exist
Do not mess with Bino, Egon with ego
Haters missed the goal like Shaq did with free-throws
Yo time un poquito, no habla un gringo
Do not knock on the door unless necessito
I’m chilling at the Waldorf, eating on some grapefruit
When everybody likes you, everybody hates you
That’s just the territory
I got to be honest, it’s very boring without a hater there to make a story
They want to tell you what’s in your heart, don’t start
Getting Salieri on my Mozart
I'mma play some Go-Kart with my little brother
Cause life is only living when we livin' for each other

We all wanna be giants, but our heads are too heavy from the mess that we're in
We all wanna have patience and we want it right now gettin' tired of waitin'
We all wanna make progress, and we sufferin' runnin' in circles again

I know there won’t be time for all of us

Josh Pyke,"When I was a kid I grew up in a house on a hill
Not the top, not the bottom, but the middle
And I still remember where I cracked my head
In the vacant lot, there's a row of tiny houses there now 
And we used to light fires in the gutters
And I could cool my head on the concrete steps
But the girl down the street hit my sister on the head
With a stick and we hid behind my father
As he knocked on the parents' door
To tell the them what she did
But the parents were drunk so they really didn't give a shit

And the girl down the street said a dog couldn't bark
'Cause a man with an axe cut its voicebox out
But my older sister told me that it prob'ly wasn't true
And I believe what she said 'cause she took me by the hand
One time when a coupla men drove down the hill in a white van
Said there was a phone box filled with money 'round the corner
And I woulda gone along but she took me by the hand
To the house in the middle of the hill
In the middle of the hill, in the middle of the hill

And my mother knew the words to a lot of different songs
And we'd always sing the harmonies, yeah we'd sing along
She had cold, cold hands when the fever hit
And then the noises that the trains made sounded like people in my head
And the stories that the ceiling told 
Through the pictures and the grains in the pine-wood boards
And let me stay outside 'til the sky went red
And I could cool my head on the concrete steps
And you could never really see the top from the bottom
But I don't pay enough attention to the good things when I got 'em
And you could never really see the top from the bottom

I don't pay enough attention to the good things when I got 'em

Josh Pyke,"Sunday's always holding a promise
Monday's always letting it go
If I could write a sad song every day of the week
I'd be the happiest person I know
So I held my hands up to the city
Turns out the city, she was holding me back
And no one wants a lover, no one wants a lover like that

I think I needed to feel a distraction
I'd never seen the January snow
Sometimes it's good to be lost, and it's good to feel alone
Being half-drunk swaying to a band you don't know
When you know all the streets like the lines on your face
You may discover you feel you have nothing to say
And no one wants a lover, no one wants a lover like that

No one wants a lover who's holding them back
No one wants a lover who's holding them back
No one wants a lover who's holding them back

So now I'm leaving just to keep the connection
It's stiff and static down a digital line
And if it's raining in the gully we'd be rushing by now
Won't sully this rush with a privileged whine.
Cause when it gets to the point where it's never enough
And every standard you drop, you pick another one up

And I've been wishing the same wish, on the first star
No stars are coming out tonight
And it's hard to see stars in the city
Wishing is never a waste of your time

No one wants a lover who's holding them back
No one wants a lover who's holding them back

Josh Ritter,"She walked right in
As time slowed down
But not enough
To keep me from ordering up

Another round
In a bottomless cup
That I had found
In the hopes of never waking up the

Jukebox played
An old country song 
About steel guitars
And how he'll try his level best
To get along
In the same old bar
Though friends gone wrong
Well he once had love but I never got that far

She must have angels on her shoulders
Their light wherever she may be
She says the angels do not know her
I guess I'm the only one who sees.

So I got my drink
And my fix my rose
But I need much more
Then this powdered blue and rented tuxedo

I need a line
A-something she don't know 
Cause' she's probably heard them all a thousand times
So I caught her eye
For the next song
And the waltz replaced
The tango like she knows that I don't belong
In these shoes
I feel all wrong
But that's just my pride, what have I got to lose?

Well last call called
But I didn't hear 
I was too busy looking
At her across the remnants of my beer
She stood to leave
And then it all came clear
That life without her was all I had to fear

You must have angels on your shoulders
Their light wherever you may be
She asks me would I like to show her?
I think I might be just the guy you need.",Angels on Her Shoulders
Josh Ritter,"

Up here in the crows nest I am swimming through the breeze

One last memory from the sun as it is sinking by degrees

And high above the albatrosses, on the wing is light

And I will sing to her as she flies by

On this beautiful night


Ahead is the horizon, always changing, it stands fast

Far behind me are the desert islands, shipwrecks Of the past

And I have seen the cannons sounding in the early morning light

But I have left my battles for the day

On this beautiful night


Below me, all the sailors, they're on this journey too

And each of us must make our unknown way upon the blue

So tonight we cast our worries,

Float Jetsam on the tide

And we'll watch them echo far away

On this beautiful night


Flat earth may end

We may sail off the edge

And not be seen again

So I sing and hope my song will form

A rope of golden chords

So that I can rescue someone else

Should they fall overboard


Because some of us are pirates and some of us are damned

But all of us, need all of us to ever find the land

And though the passage of good hope may seem

Like a needles eye

We're floating on tranquility

On this Beautiful night


Up here in the crows nest

I am swimming through the breeze

One last memory from the sun

Josh Ritter,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me

You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Josh Ritter,"Sunday night, its supper time, the hotel?s full and all is fine. 
You can see that No Vacancy sign from the window of room 39
Monday morning at half past eight, everybody's gone, they left no trace. 
I sit alone as the day grows late, wait to see your friendly face

Why you chose my hotel I'm not real qualified to tell, 
It's just your face I remember well, when you asked if I had a room to sell
Maybe you liked just what you saw, 
The cable TV and the indoor spa or maybe it was the low low price? twenty-seven bucks a night

Say the highway is for lovers, but he ain?t no friend of mine, 
Because every time I find my heart, I lose it to that long yellow line

You checked in, I checked you out, you smiled from the corners of your mouth
I turned on the no-vacancy sign as you checked in to room 39
I saw the light from your TV, you were watching channel 23, the night was long, the dark was deep, I kinda cried myself to sleep

Say the highway is for lovers, but he ain?t no friend of mine, because every time I find my heart, I lose it to that long yellow line

Morning broke itself at last, you got your continental breakfast, 
Dropped off the key and said goodbye, I think I thought I heard you sigh
I caught a glimpse of your license plate, you were drifting down the interstate
It said you were from Delaware, I said oh it must be gorgeous there",Hotel Song
Josh Ritter,"

You have chosen dawn to leave

Don't bother me while I am sleeping

Life continues and though you go out

I'll sleep another hour or so

Though you think that I am fragile

I'm a river and I'll travel on whether you are here or not

You're not the only thing I've got


So turn the light off when you leave

Don't forget to leave the key

You know I'm going to miss your touch

You say that you can't help that much

But I would have loved to see you try


It's not that we committed sins

We wouldn't know where to begin

We just love different things in our lives

I love you and you loved time

Now that my time has gone

You have risen like the dawn

And you kissed me as if once we part

I might die of a broken heart


(chorus)


Though I will not try to change your mind

Believing what you left behind

is a child who is lost confused

as a consequnce of loving you

I will not try to call your bluff

The truth would hurt you far too much

I'm sorry I got left behind

But now you're gone I feel fine


",Last Ditch Effort
Josh Ritter,"

I met you at a party or on a crowded street

A silent singularity when glances chanced to meet

You looked into my glasses, said you'd seen a ghost

I tried my best to make you smile as we calypsoed close

I have been to Cleveland and you have been to jail

You seem to be recovering but I felt a little pale

Our house it was on seventeenth above a hardware store

And there we lived with seven cats all named for seven dwarves


But like leaves and kings, all things must fall

No diamond ring's gonna cut through it all


You were working as a graverobber, you could do your job at night

I was living hand to mouth just looking for a fight

The reason why we parted it ain't that hard to find

I was always busy, and you never had the time

well the reason why we parted it ain't that hard to see

But I was never sure if I left you or you left me


(chorus)


And when it was all over I lost myself in work

You got married to a lawyer painting murals in New York

(You got married to a dentist building bridges in New York)

And though it seems a million miles ago since I saw the light

The hours flowed by nervously like warships in the night

Many times I've been corrupted but I've never been in love

I began to realise that that's just where I was

So I packed up my possessions and caught an east-bound train

met you in Ohio sleeping in the rain


(chorus)


So now we're going back again to start where we began

With rules and regulations but no real kind of plan

I've learned my lesson well with no mistakes at all

Once you find yourself true love you just keep holding on


Like leaves and kings, all things must fall

No diamond ring's gonna cut through it all


But now out of the dark, out of the blue,

like leaves and kings I've fallen in love with you

Pictures on my wall,

Fifteen different colours,

Starting with vermillion-

The first flower of the summer,

And don't think I'll be finished

Till I've begun to understand this,

With you stretched out in the sunlight,

As your laughter fills my canvas

The sun falls in my fingers,

On your back against the blinds,

It's tracing out your hollows

It is filling in your lines,

There your curl finds your spiral

As you silhouette the window,

When my brush forgives itself

Spills lines upon your pillow,

Finds you standing in the middle

Of the lines you've laid down before

Try to trace my picture into yours

Let me paint you in the corner,

As your shoulders trap the light

See the sunset feeling golden

On the wineskins of the night

I have seen your eyes in paintings

As Cathedrals cried Hosanna

Let me paint your face in frescos

Hang your hair like Angelabra

See you standing in the middle

Of lines you laid down before,

Try to paint my picture into yours

In the morning let me find you

As I call to you by name,

Your body warm beside me

Not imprisoned in a frame

I could never find the colours

Or the light that finely paints you

With those roses in your hair

Smell of wine, immortal perfume

As you're standing in the middle

Of lines you laid down before

Tryin' to paint my picture into yours


",Paint Your Picture
Josh Ritter,"This is it my dear old friend
Our paths it seems are at an end for now
Though in time we floated free
We're are pulled by separate gravities to ground

But it's clear in the way we part
With our hearts together but our hands apart
And it seems so hard to begin
Best friends we'll always be
Though your road don't follow me
I know our paths will cross again

Time has turned her face from me
And spin spirals fancy free I flew
With nothing but the dawn to see
And now I've got my memories of you

Well the road is windi' and road is hard
And there's no telling just how far
Or how many letters I might send
One day you'll walk with me
Against all probability
I know our paths with cross again

Time is like this fast freight train
You gotta ride, you can't remain behind
And all your friends are on separate tracks
And some of them and some of them they won't look back to find

The one place we all have known
The one place we can call a home
The place where each of us began
Sure as that day rolls around
When the road back home is finally found
I know our paths will cross again

Now my home is in a far off land
Where love and time have made their stand against me
And that's probably where I'm gonna stay
It's probably where they'll marry me some day

But after all is come and gone
And after every songs been sung there
Comes a thought I won't defend
Sure stones are left unturned
And on the streets where home fires burn
I know our paths will cross again
Yes I, know our paths will cross again
",Paths Will Cross
Josh Ritter,"I close my eyes and it all returns like the spinning of a potter's wheel
Trying to stay ahead a morning as time came running with us
And she beat us to the finish as we ran through the fields
You were born in the city and you didn't recognize me

Your beauty unexpected like a flower in the concrete
Some gods far below the worlds undiscovered
Set you up to ruin temples to find me on the streets
I'm an alias of who I am a counterfeited fake

In the picture I am kneeling like a dying saint Jerome
Hurling rocks at the demons who tried to come too near
Till you came in and possessed me now I feel at home

I remember the time I walked for seven hours
And thought about the people I had known for so long
All the castles I had built of of fine and precious sand
Till you came in like the tide now I don't care that they are gone

As we floated up the river I translated the verses
That were written on memorials for the ships that had sank
And I thought about the people that traded sinking for uncertainty
And drowned because of loneliness before they reached the banks

On a beach near Barcelona the young girls cry for Mary
And they bury earthen vessels in the rocks by the sea
I am sending out a bottle with a prayer upon the waves
That you'll find inside my picture and your memory will unfold me
We were talking about a trip that I had taken to the canyons

And you told me of a river that had cut through time
Leaving only the pictures of long dead sons and daughters
And you told that the paintings looked a lot like mine
I try and watch myself to see what I am saying

But my heart is on my collar and I'm asking you to take it
I don't want to go back to the way things were before
Before the dawn turns into morning I want you there to break it
And a thousand years from now when our names are just a memory
And poets have recorded what happened in the past

Lovers loving in the night will find our forms in constellations

Josh Ritter,"Pretty Polly, please come on down
From your home home high up off the ground
In the tree dark and forlorn
Where the rope hangs bruised and worn

Though I'll never fly to you
It's the last thing I would do
You have dug two holes so deep
I'm afraid that one's for me

Pretty Polly must I cry
Without your voice I'll fear I'd die
The song you sing and the story you tell
We must keep them to ourselves

Oh I know my voice like nightingale
Now I have my brand new tale
Of a tree dark and forlorn
Where a rope hang bruised and worn

Petty Polly, I have bread
That I have not eaten yet
Come and take them from my halls
Then we'll lay your song to rest

I suppose my song can wait
For I am hungry and grows late
I will eat your bread and then
I will sing my song again",Pretty Polly
Josh Ritter,"You have chosen dawn to leave
Don't bother me while I am sleeping
Life continues and though you go out
I'll sleep another hour or so
Though you think that I am fragile
I'm a river and I'll travel on whether you are here or not
You're not the only thing I've got

So turn the light off when you leave
Don't forget to leave the key
You know I'm going to miss your touch
You say that you can't help that much
But I would have loved to see you try

It's not that we committed sins
We wouldn't know where to begin
We just love different things in our lives
I love you and you loved time
Now that my time has gone
You have risen like the dawn
And you kissed me as if once we part
I might die of a broken heart

Though I will not try to change your mind
Believing what you left behind
Is a child who is lost confused
As a consequence of loving you
I will not try to call your bluff
The truth would hurt you far too much
I'm sorry I got left behind
But now you're gone I feel fine",Last Ditch Effort (See You Try)
Josh Ritter,"Anne walks alone 
Past the Domino sugar factory 
She's as easy to know 
As a broken mystery 
Conversations are slow 
With herself in dead parking lots 
Hands not being held 
End up tying everything in knots

And she's lonely

You don't deserve what you've got

Tell me why is she just wasting away

Oh so lonely?

Between your smile and your sleight of hand 
I would guess that you put something up my sleeve 
Now every time I see your face the bells ring in a far-off place 
We can find each other this way I believe

From the hills and up behind, my town 
Is naked from the horizon down 
The curvature is pressed against the raise 
We walked up in the fields alone 
And the silence fell just like a stone 
That got lost in the wild blue and the gravel gray

I keep you in a flower vase 
With your fatalism and your crooked face 
With the daisies and the violet brocades 
And I keep me in a vacant lot 
In the ivy and forget-me-nots 
Hoping you will come and untangle me one of these days 

Come and find me now",Come and Find Me

In our Lady of Immaculate Dawn 
Could have got married in the revival man's tent 
But there ain't no reviving what's gone 
Slipped like a shadow from the family he made 
In a little white house by the woods 
Dropped the kids at the mission, with a rose for the virgin 
She knew he was gone for good 

It's a long way to Heaven, it's closer to Harrisburg 
And that's still a long way from the place where we are 
And if evil exists its a pair of train tracks 
And the devil is a railroad car 

Could have stayed somewhere but the train tracks kept going 
And it seems like they always left soon 
and the wolves that he ran with they moaned low and painful 
sang sad misery's to the moon 

Rose at the altar withered and wilted 
Romero sank into a dream 
He didn't make Heaven, he didn't make Harrisburg 
He died in a hole in between

Others say God's a drunkard for pain

And I can't leave this world behind

I've been from here to Lawrence, Kansas
Trying to leave my state of mind
Trying to leave this awful sadness
But I can't leave this world behind

South of Delia there's a patch out back by the willow trees
And I can't leave this world behind
It's a fenced in piece of nothing where I hear voices on my knees
And I can't leave this world behind

Some prophecies are self-fulfilling
But I've had to work for all of mine
Better times will come to me, God willing
Cause I can't leave this world behind

This world must be frightening everybody's on the run
And I can't leave this world behind
And my house is a wooden one and its built on a wooden one
Seems I can't leave this world behind

And I'm not sure we can make it stay
Sun's going down and its the end of the day

Me and my friends in the park drinking beer underneath the tree
Lying on your back as the sun goes down, you know it's perfect cause you've got to leave

Josh Ritter,"After all the lights had died 
Out behind the palisades park 
Fireflies remembered to do 
Exactly what they were supposed to 

And memories were like coins that tumbled 
Somersaulting through the deep 
Down every well we threw them in 
Until they came to the top again 

And out like the sun 
In your hair, in your hair 

Every month that ends its spin 
Is picked up by the moon for keeping 
Clean and safe from accidents 
Sheltered from the elements 
But June is like an echo 
Of the sounds we never made 
I swear they find me in my waking hours 
Thirty days like poison flowers 

The wind in your hair 
Like a sigh, like a sigh 

With intermittent rain and shine 
The sky re-started six or seven times 
It's blue because it sees 
All our infidelities 
We both know that it's been so long 
I'm not sure what to say so I hope

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to

So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

If it was precious why'd you lose it

But if it was golden it'd shine
If it's big it won't be hard to find
If it's real it stains your hands like wine

Is that she never gave her heart to you

Josh Ritter,"Just where it now lies I can no longer say
I found it on a cold and November day
In the roots of a sycamore tree where it had hid so long
In a box made out of myrtle lay the bone of song

The bone of song was a jawbone old and bruised
And worn out in the service of the muse
And along its sides and teeth were written words
I ran my palm along them and I heard

Lucky are you who finds me in the wilderness
I am the only unquiet ghost that does not seek rest
The words on the bone of song were close and small
And though their tongues were dead I found I knew them all

In the hieroglyphs of quills and quatrain lines
Osiris the fall of Troy Auld Lang Syne
Kathleen Mauvoreen Magnificat Your Cheatin' Heart
The chords of a covenant king singing for the Ark
Then I saw on a white space that was left
A blessing written older than the rest

It said leave me here I care not for wealth or fame
I'll remember your song but I'll forget your name
The words that I sang blew off like the leaves in the wind
And perched like birds in the branches before landing on the bone again

Then the bone was quiet it said no more to me
So I wrapped it in the ribbons of a sycamore tree
And as night had come I turned around and headed home
With a lightness in my step and a song in my bones
Lucky are you who finds me in the wilderness
I am the only unquiet ghost that does not seek rest",Bone of Song

Was always tied to shore

I was always searching for ya

And green as the grass that might grow on the 23rd Psalm

Giving itself a bad name
And leaving us deep in the lurch as we walked down the lane

And I hope for your sake I've changed
And I hope for my sake you managed to remain the same

Is it raining for you raining for you now
Like it's raining for me raining for me now
You tied your old bike to a tree
Came in from the weather though not yet together

I felt your hand light on my sleeve
As light as a bird that might offer a sinner reprieve
We don't know too much I know we don't know too much

But I'm singing for the love of it have mercy on the man who sings to be adored

I'm underneath your window now it's long after the birds have gone to roost
And I'm not sure if I'm singing for the love of it or for the love of you
But I've flown a long way honey hear my confession then I'll go
I'd rather be the one who loves than to be loved and never even know
Hello brown one hello blue one
Last night's feathers exchanged for new ones

Josh Ritter,"At night we crossed the border following a Black robe
To the edge of the reservation-to Cataldo Mission
Where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts
What makes the water holy she says is that that it's the closest thing to rain

I stole a mule from Anthony I helped Anne up upon it
And we rode to Coeur d'Alene-through Harrison and Wallace
They were blasting out the tunnels-making way for the light of learning
When Jesus comes a'calling she said he's coming round the mountain on a train

It's my home-last night I dreamt that I grew wings
I found a place where they could hear me when I sing
We floated on to Hanford on a lumber boat up river
Past the fisheries and the mill-towns like a stretch of future graveyards
She was driven to distraction-said I wonder what will happen
When they find out they're mistaken and the land is too changed to ever change

We waded through the marketplace-someone's ship had come in
There was silver and begonias-dynamite and cattle
There were hearts as big as apples and apples in the shape of Mary's heart
I said inside this gilded cage a songbird always looks so plain
It's my home-last night I dreamt that I grew wings
I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.

And so they came with cameras-breaking through the morning mist
Press and businessmen-tycoons-Episcopal philanthropists
Lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman
But all we saw were lowlands-clouds clung to mountains without strings

And at last we saw some people huddled up against
The rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers
They were headed for the border-walking and then running
Then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings",Wings
Josh Ritter,"Here I am standing at your window again
Waiting for you to say go away or come in
I'm your locked door's worst knocker
I'm your curtain's best friend

[Chorus]
I'm trying hard to love you, you don't make it easy Babe
I'm trying hard to love you, I'm looking for an easy way

Your friends ask about me you say I can be found
With the cheap romance novels with their spines battered down
Oh the heart has no bones you say so it won't break
But the purpose of loving is the pounding it takes

[Chorus]

The ropes that have bound me leave no marks by their knots
And though they're your hair that don't mean I'm not caught
I know the song of the handcuffs as they scrape across the floor
But that new thing you've got I've got no clue what it's for

[Chorus]

With fortune's rocks millstones you hang round my throat
And a brick for my window weighted down with a note
I hope you find someone just as hard as you come
In this hard world sadly that's so easily done

Josh Ritter,"She's a bad actress- but hey
You give her the big lines anyway
Though her eyes are big as Canada
And the hips are South Australia
And the shoulder blade is Africa
Looking out on South America

I'm out here on the sea
And her heart ain't where it oughta be
She's a bad actress- but hey
She's got a big part in your play
Now my apartment lies awake at night

It tosses every time she sighs
Tries to take it easy on her eyes
But I can feel it giving up the fight
My whole building's on its last floors

Her heart's not in it anymore
She said she gave her heart to you
If it was precious why'd you lose it
But if it was golden it'd shine

If it's big it won't be hard to find
If it's real it stains your hands like wine
You can look but there is no use trying
Cause no matter what she said the truth
Is that she never gave her heart to you
She's a bad actress

Makes you look like you are one of the boys
Out on a Saturday night, meanwhile on the outskirts of the dance hall

On the outside of Memphis all the building look big
And the white picket fences all dare to charge around the lawn
And hold their heads up high when my headlights find them out

Get out if we go right now?

Josh Ritter,"Once I knew a girl in the hard hard times 
She made me a shirt out of fives and dimes 
Now she's gone but when I wear it she crosses my mind 
And if the best is for the best then the best is unkind

I realized that Illinois was more than I could stand 
They say working's best cause poverty is hell on a man 
Now I ride a lazy river through the Mississippi fan 
And if the best is for the best then the best can be damned

I spent a few years on the Queen of Spain 
She was a leaky little boat that went up in flames 
When the boiler blew some people started naming names 
But if the best is for the best I guess the best is to blame

I spent a few more as the Cairo Crown 
A heavyweight wrestler in the Midwest towns 
But I was lonesome for a girl who could pin me down 
They say the best is for the best but that's not what I've found

Now I listen to my sweetheart and I listen to my thirst 
I don't spend time listening to other people's words 
Sometimes they're right most times the reverse 
They say the best is for the best when the best?s for the worse

She made me a shirt out of fives and dimes 
Now she's gone but when I wear it she crosses my mind 
And if the best is for the best then the best is unkind",Best for the Best

'Cause I believe that they're the good guys

I was twisting in the hairpin 
My hands held on my mind let go 
And back to you my heart went skipping 
I found the inside of the road 
Thought about the first time that I met you 
All those glances that we stole 
Sometimes if you want them then you've got to 

Babe we both had dry spells 
Hard times in bad lands 
I' a good man for ya 
I' a good man 

They shot a Western south of here 
They had him cornered in a canyon 
And even his horse had disappeared 
They said it got run down by a bad, bad man

And there's so much where we ain't been yet

In the darker caves 
We had a lot of love 
We thought would light the way

And ships that sank in starlight                    
We saw the ghosts of angels                                
That spoke of falls from tremendous heights

[Chorus]
Don't you leave us in the dark [Repeat: x4]

We saw your old flames 
And some were burning yet 
It made us smile to see 
Just how well tended each was kept 
But other fires were burning too 
And I saw the battlefields 
The dying Light Brigade 
Stretched out upon the wheel

[Chorus]

Every heart is much the same 
We tell ourselves down here 
The same chambers fed by veins 
The same maze of love and fear 
We thought you were a saint 
But the halo was an eye 
It's hard to see how there could be 
So much dark inside the light

Josh Ritter,"I remember back in Illinois I found her 
The lily of the valley the lily of the 
West was a rose The daughter of the biggest big town banker 
He kept her like a princess I stole her like the Fort Knox gold

She used to pour Four Roses like it was going down the chimney 
Like the bottle was on fire or the boiler was about to blow 
She was up on the table when we hit Missouri 
Dancing with a movie man he was holding her a little too close

La didi da da da da da da da!

He made her the star of the silent movies 
But all she did was mouth the words all she did was mouth the words, ""Oh no!"" 
And he cast me as the villain as the sheriff's worst enemy 
I practiced falling off of buildings and out windows

La didi da da da da da da da!

The last time I saw she was tied to the train tracks 
I was back there with the extras riding on a tiger roan 
The villain on the left with the studio mustache 
Winking at Lillian blowing kisses from the second row

La didi da da da da da da da!","Lillian, Egypt"
Josh Ritter,"Radio waves are coming miles and miles 
Bringing only empty boats 
Whatever feeling they had when they sailed 
Somehow slipped out between the notes 

Out on the desert now and feeling lost 
The bonnet wears a wire albatross 
Monster ballads and the stations of the cross
Sighing just a little bit 
Sighing just a little bit 

And I was thinking about what Katy done

You turn it off but then a still small voice

I was thinking about me and Jim 
Passing Cairo on a getaway 
With every steamboat like a hymn

Josh Ritter,"I became a thin blue flame
Polished on a mountain range
And over hills and fields I flew
Wrapped up in a royal blue
I flew over Royal City last night
A bullfighter on the horns of a new moon's light
Caesar's ghost I saw the war-time tides
The prince of Denmark's father's still and quiet
And the whole world was looking to get drowned
Trees were a fist shaking themselves at the clouds
I looked over curtains and it was then that I knew
Only a full house gonna make it through

I became a thin blue wire
That held the world above the fire
And so it was I saw behind
Heaven's just a thin blue line
If God's up there he's in a cold dark room
The heavenly host are just the cold dark moons
He bent down and made the world in seven days
And ever since he's been a'walking away
Mixing with nitrogen in lonely holes
Where neither seraphim or raindrops go
I see an old man wandering the halls alone
Only a full house gonna make a home

I became a thin blue stream
The smoke between asleep and dreams
And in that clear blue undertow
I saw Royal City far below
Borders soft with refugees
Streets a'swimming with amputees 
It's a Bible or a bullet they put over your heart
It's getting harder and harder to tell them apart
Days are nights and the nights are long
Beating hearts blossom into walking bombs
And those still looking in the clear blue sky for a sign
Get missiles from so high they might as well be divine
Now the wolves are howling at our door
Singing bout vengeance like it's the joy of the Lord
Bringing justice to the enemies not the other way round
They're guilty when killed and they're killed where they're found
If what's loosed on earth will be loosed up on high
It's a Hell of a Heaven we must go to when we die
Where even Laurel begs Hardy for vengeance please
The fat man is crying on his hands and his knees
Back in the peacetime he caught roses on the stage
Now he twists indecision takes bourbon for rage
Lead pellets peppering aluminum
Halcyon, laudanum and Opium 
Sings kiss thee hardy this poisoned cup
His winding sheet is busy winding up 
In darkness he looks for the light that has died
But you need faith for the same reasons that it's so hard to find
And this whole thing is headed for a terrible wreck
And like good tragedy that's what we expect
At night I make plans for a city laid down
Like the hips of a girl on the spring covered ground
Spirals and capitals like the twist of a script
Streets named for heroes that could almost exist
The fruit trees of Eden and the gardens that seem
To float like the smoke from a lithium dream
Cedar trees growing in the cool of the squares
The young women walking in the portals of prayer
And the future glass buildings and the past an address
And the weddings in pollen and the wine bottomless
And all wrongs forgotten and all vengeance made right
The suffering verbs put to sleep in the night
The future descending like a bright chandelier
And the world just beginning and the guests in good cheer
In Royal City I fell into a trance
Oh it's hell to believe there ain't a hell of a chance

I woke beneath a clear blue sky
The sun a shout the breeze a sigh 
My old hometown and the streets I knew
Were wrapped up in a royal blue 
I heard my friends laughing out across the fields
The girls in the gloaming and the birds on the wheel
The raw smell of horses and the warm smell of hay
Cicadas electric in the heat of the day
A run of Three Sisters and the flush of the land
And the lake was a diamond in the valley's hand
The straight of the highway and the scattered out hearts
They were coming together they pulling apart
And angels everywhere were in my midst
In the ones that I loved in the ones that I kissed
I wondered what it was I'd been looking for up above
Heaven is so big there ain't no need to look up
So I stopped looking for royal cities in the air
Only a full house gonna have a prayer",Thin Blue Flame
Josh Ritter,"I still remember that time when we were dancing 
We were dancing to a song that I'd heard 
Your face was simple and your hands were naked 
I was singing without knowing the words 
But I started listening to the wolves in the timber

I heard their songs when I looked in the mirror 
In the howls and the moons round my eyes

So long, so high 
So long, so high
So long, so high
So long

Then winter came and there was little left between us 
Skin and bones of love won't make a meal 
I felt my eyes lifting over your shoulder 
There were wolves at the edge of the field
But I still remember that time when we were dancing 
We were dancing to a song that I'd heard 
Your face was simple and your hands were naked 
I was singing without knowing the words 

[Chorus]

Then one day I just woke up 
And the wolves were all there 
Wolves in the piano 
Wolves underneath the stairs 
Wolves inside the hinges 
Circling round my door 
At night inside the bedsprings
Clicking cross the floor 
I don't know how they found me 
I'll never know quite how 
I still can't believe they heard me 
That I was howling out that loud 

[Chorus]

At times in the frozen nights I go roaming 
In the bed she used to share with me 
I wake in the fields with the cold and the lonesome 
The moon's the only face that I see 
But I still remember that time when we were dancing 
We were dancing to a song that I'd heard 
Your face was simple and your hands were naked 
I was singing without knowing the words

Josh Ritter,"If this was the Cold War we could keep each other warm
I said on the first occasion that I met Marie
We were crawling through the hatch that was the missile silo door
And I don't think that she really thought that much of me

I never had to learn to love her like I learned to love the Bomb
She just came along and started to ignore me
But as we waited for the Big One
I started singing her my songs
And I think she started feeling something for me

We passed the time with crosswords that she thought to bring inside
What five letters spell ""apocalypse"" she asked me
I won her over saying ""W.W.I.I.I.""
She smiled and we both knew that she'd misjudged me

Oh Marie it was so easy to fall in love with you
It felt almost like a home of sorts or something
And you would keep the warhead missile silo good as new
And I'd watch you with my thumb above the button

Then one night you found me in my army issue cot
And you told me of your flash of inspiration
You said fusion was the broken heart that's lonely's only thought
And all night long you drove me wild with your equations

Oh Marie do you remember all the time we used to take
We'd make our love and then ransack the rations
I think about you leaving now and the avalanche cascades
And my eyes get washed away in chain reactions

Oh Marie if you would stay then we could stick pins in the map
Of all the places where you thought that love would be found
But I would only need one pin to show where my heart's at
In a top secret location three hundred feet under the ground

We could hold each other close and stay up every night
Looking up into the dark like it's the night sky
And pretend this giant missile is an old oak tree instead
And carve our name in hearts into the warhead

Oh Marie there's something tells me things just won't work out above
That our love would live a half-life on the surface
So at night while you are sleeping
I hold you closer just because
As our time grows short I get a little nervous

I think about the Big One, W.W.I.I.I.
Would we ever really care the world had ended
You could hold me here forever like you're holding me tonight

Down with the deep blue jail around her
Running her hands through the ribs of the dark

I love the way she looks in her underwear
I lose my page then the plot then the book then I swear
She makes the most of her time by loving me plenty
She knows there'll come a day when we won't be getting any

The stain of the sepia the butcher Crimea
Through the wreck of a brass band I thought I could see her
In a cakewalk she came through the dead and the lame
Just a little bird floating on a hurricane

I was flat on my back with my feet in the thorns
I was in between the apples and the chloroform
She came to me often
I was sure I was dying
It was always hard to tell if she was laughing or crying

I thought I heard somebody calling
In the dark I thought I heard somebody call

Said Christ walked on water we can wade through the war
You don't need to tell me who the fire is for

Oh bring me the love that can sweeten a sword
A boat that can love the rocks or the shore
The love of the iceberg reaching out for a wreck
Can you love me like the crosses love the nape of the neck?

Was it Casey Jones or Casey at the Bat
Who died out of pride and got famous for that
Killed by a swerve laid low by the curve
Do you ever think they ever thought they got what they deserved

Who both are like the barrel going over the falls

Sent his men to the top of some hell of a hill

Themselves what I would do next
After all that I'd found in my travels around
The world was there anything else left?
""Gentlemen"", I said, ""I've studied the maps""
""And if what I'm thinking is right""
""There's another new world at the top of the world""
""For whoever can break through the ice""

I looked round the room in that way I once had
And I saw that they wanted belief
So I said ""All I've got are my guts and my God""
Then I paused,""and the Annabelle Lee""
Oh the Annabelle Lee, I saw their eyes shine
The most beautiful ship in the sea
My Nina, My Pinta, My Santa Maria
My beautiful Annabelle Lee

That spring we set sail as the crowd waved from shore
And on board the crew waved their hats
But I never had family just the Annabelle Lee
So I didn't have cause to look back
I just set the course north and I studied the charts
And toward dark I drifted toward sleep
And I dreamed of the fine deep harbor I'd find
Past the ice for my Annabelle Lee

After that it got colder the world got quiet
It was never quite day or quite night
And the sea turned the color of sky turned the color
Of sea turned the color of ice
'Til at last all around us was fastness
One vast glassy desert of arsenic white
And the waves that once lifted us
Sifted instead into drifts against Annabelle's sides

But each morning would bring a new set
Of the tracks in the snow leading over the edge
Of the world 'til I was the only one left
After that it gets cloudy but it feels like I lay there
For days maybe for months
But Annabelle held me the two of us happy
Just to think back on all we had done

We talked of the other worlds we'd discover
As she gave up her body to me
And as I chopped up her mainsail for timber
I told her of all that we still had to see
As the frost turned her moorings to nine-tail
And the wind lashed her sides in the cold
I burned her to keep me alive every night
In the lover's embrace of her hold

I won't call it rescue what brought me here back to
The old world to drink and decline
And to pretend that the search for another new world
Was well-worth the burning of mine
But sometimes at night in my dreams comes the singing
Of some known tropical bird
And I smile in my sleep thinking Annabelle Lee
Has finally made it to another new world",Another New World
Josh Ritter,"I had a dream last night
I dream't that I was swimming
And the stars up above
Directionless and drifting
Somewhere in the dark
Were the sirens and the thunder
And around me as I swam
The drifters who'd gone under

Time, love
Time, love
Time, love
It's only a change of time

I had a dream last night
And rusting far below me
Battered hulls and broken hardships
Leviathan and Lonely
I was thirsty so I drank
And though it was salt water
There was something 'bout the way
It tasted so familiar

The black clouds I'm hanging
This anchor I'm dragging
The sails of memory rip open in silence
We cut through the lowlands
All hands through the salt lands
The white caps of memory
Confusing and violent

I had a dream last night
And when I opened my eyes
Your shoulder blade, your spine
Were shorelines in the moon light
New worlds for the weary
New lands for the living
I could make it if I tried
I closed my eyes I kept on swimming

She carries him home in a beautiful boat
He watches the sea from a porthole in stowage
He can hear all she says as she sits by his bed
Then one day his lips answer her in her own language

The first time he moves it's her hair that he touches
She asks ""Are you cursed?"" He says ""I think that I'm cured""

Often he stops to rest, but then less and less
Then it's her that looks tired, staying up asking questions

Is writing about him and he makes corrections

It's his face on her book and more and more come to look

Then one day it's too much, he decides to get up
And as chaos ensues, he walks outside to find her

She's using a cane, and her face looks too pale
But she's happy to see him, as they walk he supports her
She asks ""Are you cursed?"" but his answer's obscured
In a sandstorm of flashbulbs and rowdy reporters

Such reanimation, the two tour the nation
He gets out of limos, he meets other women
He speaks of her fondly, their nights in the museum
But she's just one more rag now he's dragging behind him

She stops going out, she just lies there in bed
In hotels in whatever towns they are speaking
Then her face starts to set and her hands start to fold
And one day the dry fig of her heart stops its beating

Long ago on the ship, she asked ""Why pyramids?""
He said ""Think of them as an immense invitation""
She asks ""Are you cursed?"" He says ""I think that I'm cured""

He's gonna dress up for Delia like a fine red rose
The angels laid him away

He brought a ten-gallon Stetson
It was ox blood red
Stacker Lee shot Louis in the back of the head
The angels laid him away

Oh Stacker Lee said to Louis, 
'Oh now don't you grieve. I'm sending you to Delia, you won't ever have to leave.'
The angels laid him away

Angels laid him away
They laid him six feet under the clay
The angels laid him away

Well the judge was a mean one
His name was Hangin' Billy Lyons
He said ""You've always been a bad man, Stack, you gonna hang this time.
The angels lay you away.""

And the jailer said to Stacker Lee 'What's the problem with you?"" 
'Aw jailer, Louis Collins' ghost brought Delia's with him, too.""
The angels laid them away

Angels laid him away
They laid him six feet under the clay
The angels laid him away

Well they buried little Delia 
In the church yard deep
With Louis Collins at her head
Stacker Lee at her feet
The angels laid them away

And out of Delia's bed came briars
Out of Louis's bed a rose
Out of Stacker Lee's came Stacker Lee's cold lonely little ghost
Angels laid them away

And I'm looking over rooftops
And I'm hoping that it ain't true
That the same God looks out for them Looks out for me and you

Be the light of my lantern, the light of my lantern, tonight
Be the light of my lantern, the light of my lantern, be the light
I need light in my lantern, light in my lantern, tonight

It's a hungry world out there
Even the wind will take a bite
I can feel the world circling
Sniffing round me in the night
And the lost sheep grow teeth
Forsake the lambs and lie with the lions

And the living is desperate
Precarious and mean
And getting by is so hard
That even the rocks are picked clean
And the bones of small contention
Are the only food the hungry find

I'll need light for my lantern, light for my lantern tonight
Light in my lantern, light in my lantern tonight

Where the thistles eat the thorns
And the roses have no chance
And it ain't no wonder that the babies
Come out crying in advance
And the children look for shelter
In the hollow of some lonesome cheek

And the sky's so cold and clear
The stars might stick you where you stand
And you're only glad it's dark 'cause
You might see the master's hand
You might cast around forever
And never find the peace you seek

I need light for my lantern, light for my lantern tonight
Be the light in my lantern, the light of my lantern tonight

For every cry in the night
Somebody says, have faith
Be content inside your questions
Minotaurs inside a maze
Tell me what's the point of light
That you have to strike a match to find?

So throw away those lamentations
We both know them all too well
If there's a book of Jubilations
We'll have to write it for ourselves
So come and lie beside me darling
And let's write it while we still got time

So if you got a light, hold it high for me
I need it bad tonight, hold it high for me
Cause I'm face to face, hold it high for me
In that lonesome place, hold it high for me
With all the hurt that I've done, hold it high for me
That can't be undone, hold it high for me
Light and guide me through, hold it high for me
I'll do the same for you, hold it high for me

I'll hold it high for you, 'cause I know you've got
I'll hold it high for you, your own valley to walk
I'll hold it high for you, though it's dark as death
I'll hold it high for you, and then gets darker yet
I'll hold it high for you, though your path seems lost
I'll hold it high for you, through the thieves and rocks
I'll hold it high for you, keep you safe from harm
I'll hold it high for you, until you're back in my arms

Be the light of my lantern, the light of my lantern, tonight

Upon whose temples with I rest my weary hopes now?
The rain distills down steeples fills the ears of lonely church mice with the

So if a long shadow falls across your heart, 
I'll be right here with you, I'm not afraid of the dark.

I'm not afraid of the dark when the sun goes down 
And the dreams grow teeth and the beasts come out and cast their long shadows
Every time they start I'll be right here with you, I'm not afraid of the dark.

Out on the hills, the hounds are baying
Out on the moor, the foxes run
To stay alive until the light has faded, 
Then pray for light that seems so long to come.

And, Honey, he's not there, just a long shadow across your heart
You can reach for me, I'm not afraid of the dark.

Josh Ritter,"So it was that everything
That went to make up everything
Was wrapped up tight inside a grain
Of great insistence
Then someone gave the great command
All things paired off for the dance
The great to small the small to grand
Down to this instant
Ooh!

The hawk around the field mouse
The love around a lover's mouth
I find my mind is settling down
In circuits round you
The angels round their crowded pins
The amber-waved electrons spin
In planetary transits
Round the ones they're bound to
Ooh!

Who do you circle round
Who is it circles round you
Is it circles round you?
Who is it circles round you
Do you circle round who
Is it circles round you?

The ghost around the one it haunts
The want around the thing it wants
The way the mind just wanders off and then returns to
The thought around the second thought
Love or gravity or law
Whatever name it's got it's got me
Circling round you
The guess around the second guess
The hornet round the hornet's nest
The wheel time the wheel fate
The light that bends itself through space
The light that with it carries time
Which also bends in the same line
Relative to point of view
So when I catch a glimpse of you
Every time you come around
The room lights up
And time slows too!",Orbital

Rolled the tumblers, threw the bolt

That I ain't learned from 'a just standin' here in this spot

Ain't nothing new about the world
That I ain't learned from just watching you go by

Separate themselves from love
By building walls a hundred thousand miles high

Ain't neither one of them so bad

Are your eyes as empty as they look?

I caught your trail as you left the pines

Up through the blue I knew the star were tumbling

I know who you are old man keep running
I tracked you down by the look in the eyes
Of a thousand gone faces pressed against their windows 
Horses hiding in the willows til the storm passed by
And a fine gray dust seemed to settle on the future
A fine gray dust seemed to settle in between 
Your hat and the dapple of my appaloosa
The only living things that I could see
And up through the blue I knew that stars were tumbling
Up through the blue I knew the stars were tumbling

I know who you are old man keep running

Your boat and did you know that when you landed I was watching
As the sky turned dark as the eyes of a foal
And I'll know you by the shift of the wind in the cobwebs
The sawdust swirls in the fins of the bullheads
The craters that you made when you lay down dreaming
Strange constellations that you gave new meaning
By the teeth marks you made on bones from the ice age
Then smell of the cinder burning slow in your rib cage
Listen in the distance and you'll hear my shadow
Footsteps soft as the tread of an echo
And up through the blue I knew the stars were tumbling
Up through the blue I knew the stars were tumbling

And the ground will open out into a mouth below us
And the mouth will open out into the empty sky
And the whistle as we hurtle through the halls of onyx
The only sound around us as we go by

And I'll follow you out through the wells of charcoal
Moonlit stones around the cones of a black hole
Through the fields where grow the ever and forever
The tessellated blooms with the voids at their centers
Through the million rooms in a bead of luminescence
The filaments on the looms of dimension

The pillars of creation where they make the planets
The billion tiny teeth that tear the charge from your atoms
In a trillion tiny bites they'll eat the meat from the pearl
And throw your soul away a cold gray little world

Josh Ritter,"The Angel of the Holy Grail saw Galahad come riding,
So he took the Holy Grail off the shelf.
And inside the Holy Chapel made for Holy Grail hiding,
The Angel could be seen to smile to himself.

If you're the Great Sir Galahad from now on, said the Angel, 
May all angels call me blessed of my race.
If you're not the Great Sir Galahad I warn you, keep on riding,
And if you are I pray you'll let me see your face.

Galahad removed his helmet, said, Good Angel, look upon me,
Fear not for I bring tidings of great joy.
For long years the Grail you've guarded now you get to let me drink it,
How happy must be angels thus employed.

All the favours that you shower upon me, a simple angel,
Said the Angel, Your benevolence abounds.
Take your boots off, Great Sir Galahad; for by your astounding beauty
Whatever ground you stand on turns to holy ground.

Galahad took off his boots and he watched the ground quite closely
And the Angel smiled to himself again.
He said, I can't believe I'm asking, but Sir Galahad please tell me -
What is it that makes you want to go to Heaven?

In Heaven there's no lamb chops, Queen Guineveres for hand jobs,
Marijuana, Kenny Rogers or ecstasy.
No pillaging, no rape, perhaps you've come by some mistake to me,
This seems more error than knight errantry.

Now what about the stable boys, I know you think they're handsome,
And some of them they think you're awful handsome too.
And sitting up in Heaven you'll still think about them often,
When you're an angel thinking's all that you can do.

At this Sir Galahad got angry, Angel, he said, don't you tempt me,
I wish to go to Heaven and not to Hell.
So when stable boys look lonesome, when the women call me handsome,
I'll hold my virtue very firmly by myself.

I guarantee you'll hold it often, said the Angel, oh one more thing -
Before you drink the cup please take your armour off.
I gotta carry you to heaven and despite what you'd imagine
I have trouble bearing heavy things aloft.

Sir Galahad stood naked and a pile of his armor,
His boots and helmet scattered all around.
His perfect lips they sipped the Grail, his perfect heart commenced to fail,
His perfect body fell upon the ground.

The Angel smoked a cigarette, when he was sure Galahad was dead
He picked all of his clothes up off the floor.
Then I put on his boots and armor, I laid his body on the altar,
Put his helmet on then I headed for the door.",Galahad

Josh Ritter,"Gonna find me a black eared bay
Gonna meet me a black haired girl
Who smells of smoke and caraway
I'm on my way to find my own heart's ease.

The high up country is the place where I
Have always longed to wander wild and free
Among the slender and the peace of mind
Grow mountainsides of my own heart's ease.

I've been with beauties and I've been with some
That even speaking of them would be like
Using the moonlight to describe the sun
The fairest one is my own heart's ease.

I've crossed the deserts and I crested swells
The unknown country and the far-flung isles
The shores of faraway and fare thee well.
There's nowhere else like my own heart's ease.

So, gather round me all you bright young blades
And this little lesson take by me
Go seek adventure gold and fame but may
Each of you one day find your own heart's ease.",Heart's Ease
Josh Ritter,"Supposedly it was a wise wise man 
Who said it’s better to have loved and lost 
Than never to have loved at all, never to have loved. 
How many times does the truth that you take to be true 
Is just truth falling apart at the same speed as you
Until it all comes away in a million degrees 
And you’re just a few pieces of fallin’ debris

And she’s hopeful. hopeful. for me.
I’m coming out of the dark clouds

She went away and she packed all her lovin’
I could not believe it how little there was 
I stood in the cold kitchen with nothin’ to say 
Who’d keep the whole world spinning when she went away yeah?

She kept telling me about the good things I deserve 
That I wanted somebody I’d mistaken for her
But one look in my eyes and she’d know she was wrong 
So she wouldn’t look back at me until she was gone 

How many times did you give all your love 
And find out it was so far from far from enough? 
I followed her out into the street in the rain 
And the whole world stopped spinning and just went up in flames 

And she’s hopeful. hopeful, for me. 
I’m coming out of the dark clouds
She’s hopeful. hopeful, for me.
She says it to me often

The sunlight corroded and the days started to fail 
The rocks in the road sharpened shadows to nails 
The fencepost were empty and so were the trees 
Had the bluebird of use on its’ last tune for me 

I’ve seen her around now with someone new I don’t know 
She likes greed-eyed boys who are haloed in hope 
But I know the look in his eyes and I know all the old signs 
Just a couple more curves before his own road unwinds 

These days I’m feelin’ better about the man that I am
There’s some things I can change and there’s others I can’t 
I met someone new now I know I deserve 
I never met someone who loves the world more than her 

She has been through her own share of hard times as well
And she has learned how to tear out the heaven from hell 
Most nights I’m alright still all rocks roll down hill
But she says I’ll get better, she knows that I will 

And she’s hopeful. hopeful, for me
I’m coming out of the dark clouds
She’s hopeful. hopeful, for me
Comin’ out of the dark clouds, comin' out of the dark clouds

It's been a long, old time if I ever did
So if I act strange, I'm hoping you'll forgive
I've got your light
I've got your light in my eyes

On some distant moon I lie on my back
For a glimpse of blue 'fore it's gone to black
It used to be like this, now it's not like that

I've got your light in my eyes

Josh Ritter,"I can't pretend that all is well, it's like I'm haunted by a ghost 
There are times I cannot speak your name for the catchin' in my throat, 
There are things I will not sing for the sting of sour notes.

I feel like a miser, I feel low and mean 
For accusing you of stealin' what I offered you for free. 
Still it baffles the belief sometimes what thieves we lovers be.

I don't know who you're with these days, might be with someone new 
And if you are, I hope he treats you like a lover ought to do. 
But whoever makes you happy, it don't really matter who 
I've got a new lover now, I hope you've got a lover too.

Praise the water under bridges, the time they say will heal 
Praise the fonder, that still grows on the absent heart and fields
Praise be to this pain, these days it's all I seem to feel.

Perhaps the fault was mine 
Perhaps I just ignored who you're always gonna be, 
Instead of who I took you for. 
I've been treated worse it's true, still I expected more.

But I will not chase your shadow as you go from room to room, 
Droppin' handkerchiefs and daggers, smokin' guns and other clues 
For what someone did with someone and who did what to who. 
I've got a new lover now, I hope you've got a lover too.

I've got a new lover now, I know that she's not mine,
I only want to hold her, I don't need to read her mind,
And she only looks like you when she's in a certain light.

I got a new lover now, she knows just what I need. 
When I wake up in the night, she can read me back my dreams, 
And she loves them,  though she never needs to tell me what they mean.

I hope you've got a lover now, hope you've got somebody who 
Can give you what you need like I couldn't seem to do. 
But if you're sad and you are lonesome and you've got nobody true, 
I'd be lying if I said that didn't make me happy too.
I'd be lying if I said that didn't make me happy too.",New Lover
Josh Ritter,"I know where the nightmares sleep
On what fodder do they feed
For two long weeks I stayed awake
Until I saw one cross your face

I knew that you had been untrue
I didn't know how but I knew
The who you spoke to in your dreams
Was never how you spoke to me
I know where the nightmares sleep
On what fodder do they feed
I followed them back down to hell
And I spent some time down there myself.

Nightmares have their dreams, as well.
And when they sleep they go to hell
And they drink their fill on lakes of blood
Canter 'cross the skull-paved
And nurse their little colts on flies
Their coltish teeth like kitchen knives
And look down from abysmal cliffs
Their dead hair by the lead wind riffed
On denizens too deep to see
Whose own dreams nightmares' nightmares be.
I know where the nightmares sleep
On what fodder do they feed
I'd been awake so long by then
They thought that I was one of them.

Nightmares cannot be rib caged
Midnight's just a steeplechase
Down silver needles half will go
And pin your navel to your soul
The other half will go instead
A' gallop 'cross the kicked-up bed
And find the one who's sleeping sound
And drag him down, oh drag him down
Drag him down, oh drag him down
Drag him down, oh drag him down
Drag him down, oh drag him down

Drag him down where I got took
And through he may not want to look
I'll sift hell for an equal pain.
Shard-born beetles boiling rain
I'll prop his eyes and down them feed
The same hell you both fed to me.
I know where the nightmares sleep
On what fodder do they feed
I followed them back down to hell
And I spent some time down there myself.

Be a joy to the joyful, be the laughter in the grief""

It's all we have and that's a lot

Backroads and the boneyards
You dropped the pedal like a holy roller

Brought up not to stay down
Sweet tea, white lightning
Breaking hearts and not minding

Your wandering star a while
Hang your heart on a quiet soul and
Stay a while in the house of gold
Each room has many mansions
Each mansion, many rooms
You'll sleep on sheets of silver
You'll eat on plates of moon

I will take up, white linen
I will a rove and go
I do not need your mansions
I'll live in a house of soul
Bring me my Florida water
Set me my serpent free
Hang ye no stars above me
I am bound for Expidite

All the love, all the love, all the love
They're gonna be my family now
And y'all can keep your thrones

I've been upon the mountain
I've been to the end of the line
I've pierced the fiery curtain
The only face that I touched was mine

I'll burned me through Ohio
I'll find the Appleseed
That lives on lightning bugs
His mouth a-glow when he begins to preach, and
I'll burn me through the handle
I'll drink the cactus truths
I'll sleep with peyoteros
Hills the color of conqueror root

I got my heavy work in
I hung your capstone, too
I'm the king of the milk maids, honey
Say my name, you know it's true

Josh Rouse,"Let me tell you a little story
Of how I got my attitude
When I moved to Manhattan
I hadn't even finished school

I was working so hard
Just to pay those bills and stay there
I have my own chamber
No one even merely cared

Time goes running out
I had to make a move
So I picked up the bass guitar
And I played it cool, I played it cool

Then a couple of years later
I'm living in Paris banks
Hanging out with DJs
Following the latest bands

I was working so hard
Just to figure out the close in the hand
Tried so hard not to show it
I walked with my nose in the air

The French didn't want me around
They didn't like my groove
So I my packed up my bass guitar
I moved to Hollywood, I moved to Hollywood

I had one last chance
It was all there waiting for me
Honey, so sunny, Hollywood

Let me tell you little secret
I'll tell you a little secret now
Let me tell you little secret
I'll tell you little story now

Time was running out
I had to make a move
So I picked up my bass guitar
And I played it cool

The French didn't want me around
They didn't like my groove
So I my packed up my bass guitar
I moved to Hollywood, I moved to Hollywood

So let me tell you little secret
I'll tell you little stupid thing
And let me tell you a little secret

Rainy, rainy afternoon
She told me she was coming over
She had some news

Always looking over her shoulder
For promises that never come
I will be the one to console her

But listen, honey, I am not the kid
To tell you how to love or how to live
And if you think that I am just a bridge
Then I'll be leaving now
This bridge is falling down

Really should stay off that corner
Someday someone will get killed
They put up sign to warn you
It's dangerous

But don't look up to the sky
'Cause your feeling is just not right
And all those [Incomprehensible]
They will die

So when are you coming over?
When you're coming make it clear

Closing all the roads
Looks like we're stuck inside tonight

Making plans of the spring?
Paint a picture while I put away my clothes

We'll ride on bicycles

As an actress, there's no screen
Couple of movies, now you're stuck
In this Broadway show

Coming from the street down below

on the right way to live
I had a lot of fun with a long legged girl

Josh Thompson,"When your parents left for a week that month
You couldn't separate the two of us
Down on the edge of that lake
Where more than memories were made

Like the water rollin' off your hips
Love rolled off of your lips
We laughed 'cause we were scared to death
A couple kids soakin' wet
A right there on the blanket that we brought

We lost more than a diamond earring
Found forever when I held you near me
Holdin' on like the world was endin'
You and I found a new beginning

As we sat there and watched the sun goin' down
And watched it come back around

When the daylight started to steal the moon
We knew we should leave but we couldn't move
Frozen from the moment that we just shared
Didn't say nothing, we just laid there
Now when I wake up to your face I go back to where

We lost more than a diamond earring
Found forever when I held you near me
Holdin' on like the world was endin', you and I found a new beginning
As we sat there and watched the sun goin' down
And watched it come back around

Lakeside in the moonlight, that's right where I want to be

When we lost more than a diamond earring

Take a crystal ball gypsy's advice

I could sit here and think about you and him together
Beat myself up fro what I could have done better
Go over your goodbye 'til it's burned in my brain
Get pissed off at sunshine and curse at the rain

Ride through the Rockies all day

And a few women that have done more than just tempt me

But I believe that Jesus died to save souls like me

On the number of commandments that you could break
Before they cast your soul away

Schooled in hard knocks, I've learned a lot,
About how a heart can break.

And wonderin' why she hasn't called,
And now it's 2 a.m.

In the arms of you ex-best friend.

But I know what it ain't.

I wouldn't treat you wrong 'cause I've been on,
The hurtin' side of pain.
I might not know what love is,
But I know what it ain't 

It ain't showing up for dinner,
With a rose and Chardonnay,
Then drinkin by yourself.
It ain't a postcard from Hawaii,

""But I met someone else.""

Recognizing her engagement ring,

I learned to work on my pickup truck, way down south
I played my guitar under the stars, out behind our house
You will always find my heart, way down south

Clothes on a clothes line, hangin' in the sunshine
A garden growin' in the ground
Country music on the radio - talk about a good ol' sound
People drivin' passed when I'm cuttin' grass
Wavin' at every single one
That's the way it's done when you come from way down south
Way down south

Swimmin' in the creek with all my friends, way down south
Prayin' them days would never end, way down south
Give me a worm and a fishin' pole, I'll pull a fish on out
Those memories will never get old, way down south

Fiddle and a steel guitar in some little redneck bar

You won't hear no hip-hop jive

Two-step to that ol' white noise

I'm talkin' 'bout white noise comin' from the white boys
I can't keep my cowboy boots from stompin'
To that white noise comin' from the white boys
Take me where those honky's are a-tonkin'

When the evenin' sun goes down crusin' through our little town
Country girls and country boys showin' off hillbilly toys

Josh Turner,"Would you go with me if we rolled down streets of fire
Would you hold on to me tighter as the summer sun got higher
If we roll from town to town and never shut it down

Would you go with me if we were lost in fields of clover
Would we walk even closer until the trip was over
And would it be okay if I didn't know the way

If I gave you my hand would you take it
And make me the happiest man in the world
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you, girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Let me know if you're really a dream
I love you so, so would you go with me

Would you go with me if we rode the clouds together
Could you not look down forever
If you were lighter than a feather
Oh, and if I set you free, would you go with me

If I gave you my hand would you take it
And make me the happiest man in the world
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you, girl

But I don't wanna spend forever in the dark.
I swear next time I'll hang on for dear life.

The best that we can hope for is one more chance.

I'm married to the woman of my dreams
Got a good truck that gets me down the highway
Everything is perfect or so it seems
Momma and daddy come by sometimes
And everything is fine
My old dog does a little singing
Late at night when the moon gets bright
Sunday morning hear the church bells ringing
Let us go and see who's getting baptized
We gonna take us a Sunday drive
Cause everything is fine

Everything is fine, fine, fine
Through the sunshine and the rain
I got a peace of mind
You know I can't complain
I make it a point to thank the Lord
When I got Him on the line
I'm feeling good and everything is fine

Got the same job down at the warehouse
Ain't never been rich but I sleep at night
Got a little girl that looks like her mamma
She likes it when her daddy tucks her in real tight
One night this week we're gonna have a fish fry

Cause everything is fine, fine, fine
Through the sunshine and the rain
I got a peace of mind
You know I can't complain
I make it a point to thank the Lord
When I got Him on the line

When I look in her eyes
It ain't no surprise
Sparks start a flyin like the 4th of July

She gets me so hot, my heart starts a poppin'
When we get to kissin, there ain't no stoppin'

When it comes to love
She ain't no slacker
My little darlin is a firecracker

When I light the fuse
I gotta get back quick
You gotta be careful with a dynamite stick

Son of a gun she fun to handle
And she packs a punch like a roman candle
She a pack of black cats in a red paper wrapper
My little darlin' is a firecracker

We might not ought to take a roll in the hay
Cause we'd burn the barn down one of these days
Were a match made in heaven
And it ain't no joke.
But id sure I hate to see it go up in smoke

We got a good thing going
And it feels so right
Shes a firecracker
Shes the light of my life.

She goes off with a great big bang
Boys I tell ya its a beautiful thing
She takes off you better hang on tight

Shes a blonde bottle rocket
In the middle of the night
When she makes love shes a heart attacker

We might not ought to take a roll in the hay
Cause we'd burn the barn down one of these days

It's hard way of livin', but i know it well

You can marry another, and it's alright with me

Just imagine the treasures I'll bring
Come lay with me, stay with me, soon I'll be gone

To sit behind the wheel
Of a brand new automobile
I love the way
A song can start to play
And take you back to younger days

I've known that kind of love
You feel it for awhile and then its gone
But girl tonight
Holding you,
I realize that I've never known
This kind of love

Sometimes its hard
To let down your guard
And trust somebody with your heart
I know how
It feels when they walk out
And leave it in pieces on the ground

Oh I've known that kind of love
You feel it for awhile and then its gone
But girl tonight
Holding you
I realize that I've never known
This kind of love

It's deeper and stronger
And lasts a whole lot longer
It's more than a word that people say

Because I've known that kind of love
You feel it for awhile and then its gone
But girl tonight

Can't stand away a day, a week, a month of my whole life
And then it hit me like a ten pound catfish upside my head
Nothing's worth doing if I'm doing it all by myself

She was looking for a helping hand, a man to change a tire

and I can be bad lord if I don't get caught
but I'd rather be loved than left alone
than be here in the middle some where between right and wrong 

Ya its her kind of love keeps me coming back time after time
Just like a beautiful song I can't get off my mind
But I worry alot about love you have to wait on
And I got second thoughts about a woman who is always gone

Josh White Jr.,"The Dutchman is not the kind of man 
To keep his thumb jammed in a dam that holds his dreams in. 
But that's a secret only Margaret knows. 
When Amsterdam is golden 
In the morning Margaret brings him breakfast. She believes him. 
He thinks the tulips bloom beneath the snow.
He's mad as he can be, but Margaret only sees that sometimes. 
Sometimes she sees her unborn children in his eyes. 
Chorus:
Let us go to the banks of the ocean, 
Where the walls rise above the Zuider Zee. 
Long a-go, I used to be a young man. 
Now dear Margaret re-members that for me. 
The Dutchman still wears wooden shoes.
His hat and coat are patched with the love that Margaret sewed him.
Sometimes he thinks he's still in Rotterdam.
He watches tugboats down canals
And calls out to them when he thinks he knows the captain,
'til Margaret comes to take him home again,
Through unforgiving streets that trip him though he holds her arm.
Sometimes he thinks that he's alone and calls her name. 
Chorus
The windmills whirl the winter wind.
She winds his muffler tighter. 
They sit in the kitchen.
Some tea with whiskey keeps away the dew.
He sees her for a moment. 
He calls her name out. 
She makes the bed up, humming some old love song.
She learned the tune when it was very new.
He hums a line or two. 
They hum together in the dark.
The Dutchman falls asleep & Margaret blows the candle out.
Chorus

Josh White Jr.,"Grandma's hands 
Clapped in church on Sunday morning 
Grandma's hands 
Played a tambourine so well 
Grandma's hands 
Used to issue out a warning 
She'd say, jason don't you run so fast 
Might fall on a piece of glass 
""Might be snakes there in that grass"" 
Grandma's hands 

Grandma's hands 
Soothed a local unwed mother 
Grandma's hands 
Used to ache sometimes and swell 
Grandma's hands 
Used to lift her face and tell her, 
""Baby, Grandma understands 
That you really love that man 
Put yourself in Jesus hands"" 
Grandma's hands 

Grandma's hands 
Used to hand me piece of candy 
Grandma's hands 
Picked me up each time I fell

What you want to spank him for? 
He didn' drop no apple core""

Josh White Jr.,"There's a yellow rose in Texas, that I am going to see, 
Nobody else could miss her, not half as much as me. 
She cried so when I left her, it like to broke my heart, 
And if I ever find her, we nevermore will part. 

She's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew, 
Her eyes are bright as diamonds, they sparkle like the dew; 
You may talk about your Clementine, and sing of Rosalee, 
But the yellow rose of Texas beats the belle of tennesee

When the Rio Grande is flowing, the starry skies are bright, 
She walks along the river in the quiet summer night: 
I know that she remembers, when we parted long ago, 
I promise to return again, and not to leave her so.

She's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew, 
Her eyes are bright as diamonds, they sparkle like the dew; 
You may talk about your Clementine, and sing of Rosalee, 
But the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl for me. 

Oh now I'm going to find her, for my heart is full of woe, 
And we'll sing the songs together, that we sung so long ago 
We'll play the bango gaily, and we'll sing the songs of yore, 
And the yellow rose of Texas shall be mine forevermore.

She's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew,

And the bails already made

To sins that you have saved me from

No more guilt, no more shame
no more thinking I can't change
Who I was is dead and gone
who I am is moving on

because of what your cross has done
You pulled away the prison doors
Hallelujah God
I am condemned no more 
I am condemned no more 

So I step out of the night into your burning light
Where my past and all its shadows disappear
You say that I am yours forever
You call me saint instead of sinner

No more guilt, no more shame
no more thinking I can't change
Who I was is dead and gone
who I am is moving on
You pulled away the prison doors

Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the dark doubt away
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Fill me with the light of day

Josh Wilson,"I tried to write a song and keep it 3 minutes long
Get in, get out, nobody gets hurt

The light behind your face helps me realize

Will we sleep and sometimes love until the moon shines
Maybe the next time I'll be yours and maybe you'll be mine

I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
It could be me
At this moment in time
Is it in your mind at all
It should be me, it could be me
Forever

Wandering through life will love come home to you
And the love you want forever, will they be true to you

Will we sleep and sometimes love until the moon shines
Maybe the next time I'll be yours and maybe you'll be mine

I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
It could be me
At this moment in time
Love's indescribable
It should be me, it could be me

Three long years now, since she left his angry place
Destiny called her but too soon for her age
Oh if I'd, I'd only listened, she might be here today

And we're all gonna ride this river
And we're all gonna feel the rain
And we all take what we're given
Even the pain

Cold, tired and hungry, now she's movin' with the wind
And all I do is worry about the pain she must be in
If only I could see you, tell me why you didn't write?
Now there's no one there to defend you and I can't sleep at night

And we're all gonna ride this river
And we're all gonna feel the rain
And we all take what we're given
Even the pain

And we see the light before us
Through the darkness and the shame
But it all breaks down, it all breaks down
Even the pain

So roll on mighty river
Take us down to the sea
Wash away the muddy waters
Set us free

And we're all gonna ride this river
And we're all gonna feel the rain
And we all take what we're given

And we see the light before us

He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you 

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

He played Fire on the Mountain run boys, run
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in a bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No child, no

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back
If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been""

Haven't been inside for years
Locked within, within my memories, within the darkest depths of my soul

Tell me am I here to make this wrong or right
Sinking I've lost all sense of time
I hear in a better range
Have I lost my mind have I gone insane
Holds onto her long lost dream that she lost her head to insanity
All I want to do is turn the page but my heart holds onto a memory

Losing faith
Wearing thin
When will I see the light
These hues and melancholy, but still I refuse to lose

Tell me am I here to make this wrong or right
Sinking I've lost all sense of time

Have I lost my mind have I gone insane

Joshua Armstrong,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear,

I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.

It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe,

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse.

The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

When time wasn't an issue at all
It was where you were going
How far you could walk

Do you remember?
Do you remember?

Do you remember
The scent of the summer so sweet?
As the the stars would watch over
Our souls through the weeds

And the hounds in their fences
Would bark at the breeze
While we d scream out confessions
Of love through the trees

Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
'Cause I do

It was the year 93
If my mind does recall
Seems so long and so distant
Not distant at all

I sang songs to you crying
Till something did change
It was time, it pushed us older
Till we didn't even say hello

Hello
Hello
Hello

It?s been four long years
Since I've seen your face
Your voice will still resonate inside my bones
When the breeze runs by
And whispers that old song, I do

Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
I do

On a bus with your FM Radio, half drunk
A cigarette hanging out

Crying out
What happened to your lonely soul?

And think of the many many people
Across the many miles of earth
That have no clothes, no food to eat

And what about the air we breathe
To the food we eat are filled with things that kill
Our deaths are closer than we think

Well another silly love song could make me sick
About a heart broke emo rocker and his messed up chick
Are we so deaf dumb and blind we can't see the candlestick
Burnin' down?

Wakes up on her Monday morn
It's just another cup of coffee
In her run down place called home
She makes her way out to the car

The radio blares to drown
All the many many faces in her head
That at one time cared
But they have all moved and gone

Now to work she goes
Removing all her clothes
For all the perverse older men in our sickly generation
But they don't give a damn

Well another silly love song could make me sick
About a heart broke emo rocker and his messed up chick
Are we so deaf dumb and blind we can't see the candlestick
Burnin' down?

Open your souls, open your minds
There's a lot of wonderful people in the world outside
Open your souls, open your minds
There's a lot of wonderful people in the world outside

About a heart broke emo rocker and his messed up chick
Are we so deaf dumb and blind we can't see the candlestick
Burnin' down?

I could say hello but I want a conversation
I could love till I'm dead but how long will I live
Till I'm down, we're burnin' down, ooh ooh oh oh oh oh
",The New Love Song
Joshua James,"Apologies never sounded insincere than when calling up a mother
Her bloody child on the battle field of war
While the pretty politicians lay their babies down to sleep
Not a chance in hell will that boy taste the blood

And the triumphant view of liberty stands firmly in New York
While the color of our ocean's painted red
Well president, I hope you found what you went over looking for
Or is your plan to send us all until we're dead?

Because one by one we will watch them die
In shallow graves our soldiers lay
Well NBC show us the blood on the country side
God bless, God bless the U.S.A.

If the document of freedom keeps us safely in our homes
Then it's fine to sacrifice our brothers blood
'cause it ain't my son that's fighting in the war across the seas
Give 'em hell boys point and shoot their time has come

Because father, son we will watch them die
Manifest destiny you paved the way
NBC show us the blood on the country side
God bless, God bless the U.S.A.

Line us up, give us guns we're trained to kill
The time has come, let this war drain all our brothers blood
Line us up, give us guns we're trained to kill
The time has come, let this war drain all our brothers blood

Because one by one we will watch them die
In shallow graves our soldiers lay
Well NBC show us the blood on the country side
God bless, God bless the U.S.A.

Joshua James,"I dream of dusty roads
Paved with gold that lead me in your eyes
The marmaladed paintings
Sing a song that not the crows will try

The Piano screams a sound inside your lips
I have found something I could never save
The current pulls me down into your river deeper now
Than I had ever planned to sink, planned to sink

Scattered winds blow me cross the ocean
Turns and spins, leaves me breathless
But with no sense of my direction
Or where the main land sits, where I find my soul

The battles fought and fight inside these walls
The blood still stains my dress
Through we spoke, my broken bones
The chandelier means more you said

The thunder screamed a light into the thick black painted night
But not a muscle did you move for me
The rapids growing taller than I ever do recall
Dragging my soul to sea, my soul to sea

And I said, ""Lord, what have I done?""
And I said, ""Lord, what have I done?""

Scattered winds blow me cross the ocean
Turns and spins, leaves me breathless
But with no sense of my direction
Or where the main land sits, where I find my soul

I need the help, pick me up
I'm feeling low, the alcohol
Is wearing off

The cocaine wore a hole inside
My bitter soul, my foolish pride
Call my pa, tell you saw me
Hangin' here

The blood it stains, the carpet well
You ran and told, somebody else
But now it's gone, the need I felt
The cocaine drug, inside my head

Please leave me hangin' here
Please leave me hangin' here
Please leave me hangin' here

And you don't think of me anymore
Is it too selfish to suppose, love
That you'll think of me when you fight
So will you meet me in the middle

In the shade, I'll bring you home

You know, you know, in the waves
I'll meet your boat
You know, you know, and in the grave
I will see your soul

So will you meet me in the middle
Of the road

I can tell, you've been crying
Driving down 5th and Main
You tried to so hard to forget me

Though my memory has been dying

Wasn't really sure what it was all about.
But it felt like I was disappearing,
So I ran to the mirror to check it out.
I said, ""Here I am, here I am, here I am
But why do I feel like the invisible man?""
I stumbled back into the bedroom,
And stared out at the rising sun.
Then I heard myself shout out the window,
Not really talking to anyone.
I yelled, ""Here I am, here I am, here I am
But why do I feel like the invisible man?""
Lights went on, people started yelling,
""Will the crazy man go back to bed.""
And there I was, laughing out my window,
Feeling much better now, somebody heard what I said.
Well it's no big thing, no revelation,
No answer to these lives we lead.

Sometimes I think we all need to say;

You wonder where her man went, you wonder if she minds
They've got smiles and healthy tummies
So you guess they're doing fine

She can weave a spell upon you with any song she sings

Oh, she's a desert flowers, growing free and wild
Her beauty seems so fragile, fragile as a child
And you wanna take her with you
But you know she must remain
So you leave her wishing you could turn yourself into the rain
Turn yourself into the rain, turn yourself into the rain
You leave her wishing you could turn yourself into the rain

I pulled my car off the road and parked beside her stand
She asked where I was going so fast and far alone
I told her how love was something
I wasn't sure I'd ever known
She said, ""Maybe you never heard the desert
Sing her song at night
Or maybe you just been trying much too hard to get it right""

Oh, she's a desert flowers, and growing free and wild

Joshua Karai,"Blades of grass
That shiver as I pass
The worlds asleep but I'm awake
I'm walking home again

Morning stars
Left my shoes back at the bar
Didn't know my house was quite this far
So far from anywhere

Strange how the ground
Tips upside down
And morning it starts without me
Did I let you down

Should I come around
Would that make things better baby 
You and I
We get along just fine

But oh we both love to be right
It's just not possible
Change your mind or maybe I'll change mine
But either way we don't arrive at something

Plausible
I'll see ya round when you're in town
And you can pretend to hate me
All trace of love

Has turned to dust
Which I've been collecting lately",Dust
Joshua Payne,"Through of flesh and blood
We hunger for what lays beyond
In a world that lies to love
Still we rest above

It's the art of the heart
It's the power of us
When the night overtakes
When I want to give up

There's a sweet ray of light
Every time that we touch
Love can paint a new picture
It's the art of the heart

Yesterday can cloud my mind
Shadows make me color blind
But faith will light the darkest skies
With the sunrise of your smile

It's the art of the heart
It's the power of us
When the night overtakes
When I want to give up

There's a sweet ray of light
Every time that we touch
Love can paint a new picture
That's the art of the heart

Uh uh, uh uh, oh

There's a sweet ray of light
Every time that we touch
Love can redeem our forgotten dreams
That's the art of the heart
It's the art of the heart

Joshua Payne,"If a picture paints a thousand words, 
then why can't I paint you? 
The words would never show, 
the you I've come to know . . . 

If a face could launch a thousand ships, 
then where am I to go? 
There's no one home but you, 
you're all that's left me to . . . 

And when my love for life 
is running dry, 
You come and pour 
yourself on me . . . 

If a man could be two places at one time, 
I'd be with you, 
tomorrow and today, 
beside you all the way . . . 

If the world should stop revolving, 
Spinning slowly down to die, 
I'd spend the end with you 
and when the world was through . . . 

Then one by one 
the stars would all go out . . . 
Then you and I 
would simply fly away!",If

Smiling down on me, no matter what the place is
I find myself stargazing
Mostly finding you amazing by the moon

Oh, no one seems to understand this waning
Condition of our friendship
What's this we are contemplating?
No one ever will

But still I feel a kinship with the moon
Oh, I was lost to lose you
And so my eyes would seem
To be crying, to be lying

I couldn't hide the dream
But somehow I seem fulfilled
And I always will
Because you've got the view

And the clouds don't blind your way

Joshua Payne,"Just below the exit sign
You were shining like the moon
You looked at me as if
You left your heart somewhere
And now you've gone and closed the door

I tried to smile, I tried to play
The one who simply walks away
But the streetlights sing your song
And I can't get along
Without your love inside of me

Run away, run away
Don't let the stars get in your way
The sky was painted blue
The night that time stood still

The paper skies are packed away
The Chinese lanterns swing and sway
You said that love was like a traveling rodeo
It comes to town and then it goes

Far away in love's junk store
I found your letter waiting at my door
It said, ""I loved you so
You made my life stand still""
It said, ""I loved you so
You made my life stand still""

",You Made My Life Stand Still
Joshua Payne,"Home, the only place I know 
Where the heart, the heart finds healing 
When the night is cold and dark 
Come just as you are 

Home, your memory calls me home 
Where I'm resting in your arms 
It humbles me to know 
No matter where I go 
There will always be a place for me at home

And somewhere in the night I call your name 
And somewhere in the night love answers me
I will never let you go 
You will never know a night alone 
I will make your love my home

Lost in a dream for something more 
I found you were all I needed 
You are the strength of us 
Without you I'd be lost 
There will never be another place like home 

And somewhere in the night I call your name 
Somewhere in the night love answers me
I will never let you go 
You will never know a night alone 
I will make your love my home 

The road is long and I am weak 
But through the rain I see 
The light that leads me home

And somewhere in the night I call your name 
Somewhere in the night love answers me 
I will never let you go 
You will never know a night alone 
I will make your love, home","Your Love, My Home"
Joshua Radin,"Looking from the window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
Movin' further away
Want you near me

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I need you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more

Wonder if you'll understand

Still I wait to heal

What I need
Are more bandages
They've torn over time

You shelter from the rain
Turn around walk away
Go now and don't look back
My life's come off its tracks
And you should be
Free of me

I couldn't be who you wanted
Somewhere down the road
When I'm whole
When the rains are done
When I've reaped all I've sown
But here and now
On my hands and knees
I crawl through the ?
And your bead is so soft and warm
I'm weary and tired

Leave me alone
I'll find another home

You'll see.
Oh baby, one look just might save me.
I need you to slow by the corner.

Till then I'll see you hopefully through.
I do wish that you'd ask me to ride along.
It wouldn't be wrong to tell me more than I know about you.

You know there's still darkness ahead, you know it

You and I know, flowers only grow 
When the rain falls, my baby.

Watching it consume a new day, my baby.

From wanting with desire in a new way, my baby.
Lying with you seems like waking from a dream,
When you say, my baby.

While I need, my baby.
And I can try to make,

How you really know what I feel, my baby.

I've seen more hurtin'
On this road back from hell
Than I would wish on anyone

For everything I faced in this world
It seemed the darkest
With the devil at my door
But with time comes the truth

And I've had to go through the worst
To get to the best I've ever been

I thought no one could love the kind of fool I was
No one was brave enough to take that chance
Then you lifted me so unselfishly
You reached out your hands and caught me
It's your love that brought me where I am

I have recovered, I am home
Now I believe in heaven
My hurt's my own, the battle's won
Those demons gone

And I've had to go through the worst

(I've seen better days)
Left behind a friend of mine

Said for one, the only one
I turned my back at her

The elevator rose to the eleventh floor
(I've seen better days)
Her trench coat hangs inside her door
(I've seen better days)
A leaky window welcomed rain and left me standing here
A black-haired girl who taught me truth
I turned my back on her

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered

I regret i didn't turn
And run back home to you

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days, better days

Now i stand in sympathy
Not for her but for me
I could have turned i could have stayed
But i just walked away
I could have done a lot of things

What a lovely dream it was
I dreamed we all were alright
Happy in a land of oz
Why did everybody laugh when I told them my dream?
I guess they all were so far from that kind of that scene
Feeling real mean

I heard a song last night
What a lovely song it was
I thought I'd hum it all night
Unforgettable because

All of the players were playing together
And all of the happies were as light as a feather
See, your love remember is a freeing of soul
But as I recall, the rest will just follow

When I first met you baby
From all the wrong she had done to you
Then I came along and applied a little lovin'
Slowly but surely I brought you through

Now she's back to rekindle that old flame
She's got a different angle baby 
But she's playing the same old game

Baby don't be a victim of a foolish heart 
Don't let her lies get next to you
She's just tryin' to tear us apart 
She's tryin' to make me her victim too

Now I know she comes around here every time I leave
(Look out baby)
Because she knows she's still on your mind

Even a wise man jumps in misery somewhere down the line
(Listen Baby)
But only a fool would jump the second time

Our affair is growing stronger everyday
Don't let her come and steal our happiness away

Erase the past but no

I will help you put the pieces back

And if your heart is locked and you can't find the key

I'll set you free

That forces you to say that life's unfair
It makes you scared of what tomorrow may bring
But don't go giving into fear 
Stop hiding all alone in there

But you'll miss the whole damn thing
I wish I had a crystal ball to see what the future holds
But we don't know how the story ends till it's all been told

So baby kiss the past goodbye

Then you roll the dice take a slide

But when it stops you realize 
That you're right back where you started at

Whether to be or not to be

Trying to tear us apart

See you're the one in denial

Tired of creeping around when I'm craving for
His kiss
Whenever I'm  lonely he is the only one
I miss
You say it ain't right but I think that you got it wrong
Its bliss
And I love him yeah yeah
I love him

He makes me go oh oh oh 
When he looks at me 
Oh oh oh 
And it's plain to see
Nothing you can do
To discourage me
And I love him
I really love him

My parents say I'm too good and that he doesn't deserve me
My friends think he's not cool enough so they'd rather desert me

But I don't want him, no
I've got my man

There's nothing you can do

I see is change 
I embody change
All we do is change
Yea, I know change

That reflects the way we want things to be

It exceeds all expectations
It requires both now and then
See, although the players change,
The song remains the same
And the truth is,
You gotta have the balls to change

(Hey, hey, hey)

What you think about me and you being together?
Could you break and shake my cold and stormy weather?
Have you got this under control?
Show me you know about a woman's soul

[Chorus]

I'll make you feel the way you wanna feel
I love how it's real 
We're one in two minds
Maybe it will stick 
You'd better be quick
I hope that you heard me right
Tell me, tell me 'cause I won't wait 
Suspense I just hate, so spit it out now
If you're feeling like I do
Won't you come and do it to me
So tell me, babe

Tell me 'bout it
Tell me 'bout it, baby
Tell me 'bout it

You don't have to make your mind up
I just wanna take my time with you
(Yeah)
If that's alright
It's alright, it's alright
Oh, forgive me if I get to shy, but
Maybe you're the reason why
I'm feelin' butterflies

Somethin' 'bout the look in your eyes
Oh, it just makes me feel so right

Well, you're my boy
You're my joy
You're my dream
I'm for ya

You're everything that I need
I love how you love me
If I'm made for you
You're made for me
It's too good to be
So tell me what we're gonna do now

Funny how my world keeps spinnin'
Sometimes you can be so silly
You know just how to make me laugh
Yeah
Oh, you're skin is so lovely
When you touch me
I know that you got my back
(Sure do; yes, I do)
I feel so safe when you hold me
It's already like you know me

See, baby, I love how you make me smile
Don't leave
Please stay awhile
Let's make this happen
I don't care how

Right now, let's stay in the present
Can't worry 'bout tomorrow 'cause today is a blessin'
The world in a state of aggression
I find calm in you
I see my mom in you
It's like a feelin' in a nigga's stomach
When you want it so bad
If you keep keepin' it fresh
It ain't gonna go bad
I been through the valley of love
Rolled the shores of Cali
Just to find peace of mind
Lookin' to the sky
Askin' for at least a sign
Beautiful, you came at such a decent time
When we combine
It's like good food and wine
Flavorful yet refined
You remind me of the divine
So easy
Love can be lost and then found, like Stevie
I just love havin' you around
You wearin' a gown
I'm wearin' a crown
Pound for pound
We the freshest couple in town

Well, you're my boy
You're my joy
You're my dream
I'm for ya 
I adore ya 
You're everything that I need
I love how you love me

I've been holding on for way too long

Just one day to prove to me
That your love has got the power

They say Rome wasn't built in a day, but hey
They've got nothing on the patience

Are slipping through your hands

I walk out of my front door

That today is the day that you're gonna
You gonna smile in front of my face

Something worth talking about
Tell me that you love me
Tell me you gonna be a man
Show off for me baby

Should be enough for you love

Will this episode explode to a lot of love, I just don't know
Is this the door that will never close?

If you asked me this a year ago
To lay down by your side, I'd run a mile
Being close was impossible, had too much to lose

At my feet
And lit a flame of passion
That burns eternally
Love may come
And love may go
But you're the man that made me
And no one else can change me
You're my Adam, and I'm your eve
And if I live a hundred years
I know there'll only be
One love in my lifetime
Only one love
Burning in this heart of mine
You're the one love
In my lifetime
And if I live a hundred years
I know I'll never find
A love that's stronger
Than an oak tree
That will be standing in the sun
When my life is done
One love in my lifetime
Only one love
Burning in this heart of mine
One love",One Love In My Lifetime [*]

Look at what you put me through
If I had a chance to plan what I would say to you
I'd turn around so beautiful 
And look you in the eye just to prove
I don't love you or need you
Clouding my mind 
In darkness I'll find
Nothing at all, at all, at all

Baby can't you hear this sound
All the arguments are screaming out
This ain't love that we've found at all, at all
Baby won't you realize
You know that I'm not your prize
Why we wasting our time
To me you're nothing at all

Please don't think I'll forget ya
Nothing in the world could move
All the scars you gave me
Memories I just can't lose
If I had a chance to show ya
How it feels you know I would do
My best to test just how
Heartless you really are
To me you're nothing at all
To me you're nothing at all
At all, all

You know that I'm not your prize
Why we wasting our time
To me you're nothing at all
To me you're nothing at all

Why don't ya, why don't ya
Leave me
Go get out
Turn around
'Cause I got a mouth that'll knock you down
And when it's over you won't know what hit you
'Cause you'll be looking up at me from the ground

Won't you take the time to lay it all out on the table and figure this out
Reality is staring us right in the face
I'm in a place I can't seem to turn around
Something's gotta give
We can start to live without having to shout so loud
Relationship's a trip with a lack of light
It's the time we need to get out

Why we wasting our time
To me you're nothing at all

And this ain't love
This ain't love that we've found

See, I know love don't look like this
And I know love don't taste
Nothing like this, nothing at all
'Cause I've had enough
I've had enough of your lack of love
I've had enough of this bad taste
Had enough of you wasting my time
To me you're nothing at all

I can imagine it'd be much more than
A turn of the tables so you can be able
To feel the heat of the every beat
Let go, let go, leave those cufflinks on the street
It's an itch you got to scratch, yeah burn your mail, mail

No hot, you got to match, you can stay or you can bail
I hold a lighter, hope you cash, hope you dash
We dim the brightness, you relax, you relax
I wanna see what you look like when you leave but will you leave?
Will you feel lovely as you smoke the breeze?

Jotdog,"Me fui sin dejar pista
Hoy ya no estas en mi lista
Me convertí en artista
Para así perderte de vista
Reuní un millón de historias
Para encontrar memorias
Que me dejaran mostrarte
Yo soy una cosa aparte

El horizonte tiene otras cosas
Que me brillan mucho mas que tu
Mejor te entierro en mi caja rota
Para que no estorbes
No me quites

Porque no tengo a donde ir
Las pequeñas cosas
Que nos conectaban
No las haces más
Y me desconecto
Este amor perfecto
Ahora no es correcto
Ya no puedo más!

De ti ya no soy parte
Te diste cuenta muy tarde
No se como explicarte
Tú no eres una obra de arte
Lamento haberte herido
Pero hiciste lo prohibido
Y de haberlo sabido
Jamás me hubieras tenido

En un minuto detuve el tiempo
Para ver lo que seria de mí
Como arrancaste de mí las ganas
Y es que estar contigo es un castigo

Porque no tengo a donde ir

Que nos conectaban

Pero no dejo de soñar contigo.
Y las estrellas guardan para si
Este secreto que aun sigue vivo

Y siempre me pregunto
Si piensas en mi boca
Porque decías que no habría otra
Porque sin ti a mi se me va la vida
Y si es que te vuelvo a ver sabras que te extrañe
Piensa en mi
Invéntame en tus días
Aunque no pienses volver

Cuando era niña yo siempre creí
Que algún día acabaría contigo
Hoy el futuro que llego hasta aquí
Trae tu recuerdo que en mi sigue activo

Y siempre me pregunto
Que harás cuando hace frió
Porque decías que yo era tu abrigo
Porque sin ti a mi se me va la vida

Why should I have to be the one
Who has to convince you

Someday when you're free

Only works it out the best he can
Valentines he never sent

Do you got another lover now
Do you think it's me you're foolin' now
No.

And when you're alone remember why
You had never learned how to cry.
No...no

(chorus)

Oh...i can see it in your eyes
Ever since you walked away
Said your last goodbye
Oh...i can see it in your eyes
All the damage has been done
No more alibis

(vintage neal solo)

Say you got another lover now
Tell me who you think you're foolin' now

(chorus)

Oh...i can see it in your eyes
Ever since you walked away
Said your last goodbye
Oh...i can see it in your eyes
All the damage has been done
No more alibis

Oh......
Oh......

How you can move me with just one glance

All the things I love about you
Keeps amazing me now
All the things I love about you

You're a garden of many hidden secrets
Leaving clues to the mysteries you will reveal
You are the eyes of intuition
You see through illusion... you know what's real
Just something you feel

And 'round and 'round again

And I try
I try to reason why
Don't you know I can't go on this way
Baby please don't walk away there is this place
Where I toss away my pride
So you can see that I'm the one
To take you to a higher place this time

I am on the outside looking in
To a place where I will be
Let me give you what you need from me
I surrender my soul to you
And my heart is pounding
And a fire's burning
And my head is spinning, 'round and 'round again

Oh, I crash, and burn inside my mind
It happens time and time again, I can't explain the way you make me feel

Journey,"There's a state of grace that happens every day
It's a feeling I thought lost or locked away
Another question to an answer that I know
Oh, are you coming home, coming home for sure
I'd walk a thousand miles, just to hear you calling out my name
Kiss me softly
Kiss me slowly
I get lost in you
Like only lovers do
Hold me closer
Love me tender
I get swept away
Like only lovers do
You've awakened something deep inside my soul
And every moment, every breath I feel it more
Your hidden treasure that you kept down deep inside
We make love freely as we watch the new sunrise
I'd live a thousand lives if every one I lived could be with you
Kiss me softly
Kiss me slowly
I get lost in you
Like only lovers do
Hold me closer

Journey,"From the first day, 
I envisioned myself with you
It's so hard to wait, 
But with you it was easy
To do
Somewhere in time
I knew I would find you here with every
Passing moment
I see forever so clear
Part of me was lost without you
You are where I found my faith
Feels like love is here to stay

[Chorus]
When I look in your eyes baby
I see a lifetime of dreams come true
And I want you to say, that you feel the same
Way too
The stars in your eyes tell me
All my tomorrows will wait for you
You're all of my prayers answered
My one saving grace is you

In another life, I believed that I loved you then,
If lightning strikes twice, we are destined
Together again
We don't have to make a promise, we were
Always meant to be
It's written in the way you look at me, I see

[Chorus]

Love moves at the speed of light
Takes years to get it right
But we've got till the end of time
I can see, I can see, You and me, forever
You're the one woman that can make me stay
My one and only saving grace

Out of here,
Get me on my way and go
I've been waiting for a sign to appear,
To show me the way to a place I've never known

Your love and blind faith
There in the sky spins a wheel, it's givin' me
The feelin' that my dream
Came true today

I'll go into the night whispering your name
If lying in your arms is the last thing that I do

And someone reads these words I've written only meant for you

In which the lady said them?

For love right then
But we met destiny, and it sealed our fate

[Chorus: x2]
We'll meet again (we will meet again)
I know we will (we will meet again)
On my heart it's written (we will meet again)

And I will hear the wind that told me
I will return again my love have patience

So until then...
I'll be waiting for you knowing somehow

She'd be the one that I would find among the faces

What is life without someone to share

Losing daughters and sons, we all feel the pain
Through the tears, why don't things ever change
Between now and then

That familiar sweet love song
We still share the same desire

I could spend every day of your life looking for something that's so hard to
Find
We all make mistakes sometimes that only make us stronger, keep the love alive
When you're lonely and your heart's filled with doubt
That's when you need to know

Chorus:
I'll take all of you
My arms are open wide
I'll hold you closer till the day I die
And I promise you
I'll be standing by your side
No matter what this life puts us through
I will take all of you

I should've known you're beautiful
No one can see it deep within your soul
You don't have to show me how
Cause loving you comes easy
I thank God for what I've found
So when I find the strength inside to let go
Baby that's when you know

Chorus

I'll take the good time with the bad
I'll give you everything I have
Cause we'll stand together
I'll take a wrong and make it right
Won't let a single day go by
Without you beside me

And I know all this means is whiling on the hours watching side-shows
And I feel like I'm on the outside of a circle

I'm going somewhere I can warm my bones

leave the winter on the ground.

in the bedroom and all around.

It must have been good but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out.

Make-believing we're together,
that I'm sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water
like a teardrop in your palm.
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,
it's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows

I'm only gon' ride with you, like a two seater
Ooh baby, you know this ain't no test drive
Fly you out from the east to the west side
I only got room for you, like a two seater

I got a lot of girls on my timeline
But you're the only one that's on my mind
They try to throw me signs
But I ain't caring 'cause I got a dime

She my lady, I tell 'em every time
She amazing, my my
Upgrade like graduation
She hold me down like gravitation
They can't break my commitment up with ya, oh

Stuck to my side like Siamese
Girl you know I need you right beside me
Want you real close to my body

I only got room for you, like a two seater
I'm only gon' ride with you, like a two seater
Ooh baby, you know this ain't no test drive
Fly you out from the east to the west side
I only got room for you, like a two seater

Don't bring none of your friends tonight, it's only me and you
In that SLS Mercedes coupe, we drift aloof
Never out the loop, she blow me like a can of soup
I'm never losing, you rich but you PT-Cruising, okay
I'm really having that way
You really spoiled 'cause every time you have it your way
You happy now 'cause your ex-nigga was cirque du soleil
Don't play, I'm not for all the gunplay
But brother 'dem'll knock you out your feng shui
I keep racks in my pocket though
And it's only room for two like a socket though
And sometimes maybe three when you're feeling nasty
I drop a 20 in the mall when I'm feeling cashy
I'm gon' go
All these other niggas need to know that
You'll always be loved like a throwback
And baby girl I hope you know that
I hope you know that

I only got room for you, like a two seater
I'm only gon' ride with you, like a two seater
Ooh baby, you know this ain't no test drive

Jovanotti,"A settembre compio 25 anni 
Nel 2000 sarò grande avrò 34 anni
Certe volte mi domando come cacchio sarò 
E se avrò ancora la carica pazzesca che ho 
Per adesso mi va bene così 
Le tue storie puoi tenerle lì 
Ho provato a stare in riga con te ma non mi riesce

A me mi piace la batteria 
E una chitarra che ti porta via 
Io amo i ritmi che viaggiano 
Abbasso i lenti

Ho girato e rigirato 
E ho capito che quello che si balla in due 
Si può ballare in tre 
Che la musica è la cosa più bella che c'è 
Specialmente se la musica fa parte di te 
Per adesso mi va bene così 
Le tue storie puoi tenerle lì 
Ho provato a stare in riga con te ma non mi riesce

A me mi piace la batteria

Non è una festa nazionale

In spiaggia o sotto il cielo

Chi rimarrà da solo a cercar consolazione 
Potrà trovarla se vorrà dentro una canzone

Jovanotti,"È sempre la stessa canzone che si ripete 
È sempre la stessa canzone non mi credete
È il tempo che passa in avanti è una strada che va
Che va, che va, ma dove va? 
Il tempo che passa
3 minuti una canzone 
Il tempo che basta per un'emozione 
Che ti lega al momento che tu stai vivendo 
E lo chiude in un ricordo che rimane nel vento 
E che si fermerà ogni volta che tu sentirai 
La tua canzone per una volta in più 
Ma è sempre la stessa canzone che va 
La stessa di 1200 anni fa 
È sempre la stessa canzone che va 
È sempre la stessa canzone che va 
Una per una volta che hai vissuto una storia 
Per una ragazza per una vittoria 
E per il momento più triste di tutta la vita 
Per l'estate più bella
Per quando è partita 
È una chiave pazzesca 
Che riapre le porte 
Il ricordo ritorna 
Ogni volta più forte 
Più forte 
Il tuo cuore rivive la storia 
Canzoni che restano nella memoria di chi? 
Ma di tutti la musica è una 
Ed è sempre la stessa canzone come la luna 
È sempre la stessa canzone che va 
È sempre la stessa canzone che va Milano
Riccione
Casello casello 
Un amico che più di un amico è un fratello
L'estate che tutti eravamo promossi 
San siro e i 70.000 di Vasco Rossi 
È sempre la stessa canzone che va la radio
Il juke box
Il Festivalbar 
E ti sembra che la musica sia nata con te do re mi fa do re mi re 
Ma è sempre la stessa canzone che va 
La stessa di 1200 anni fa 
È sempre la stessa canzone che va 
È sempre la stessa canzone che va 
Per rompere il ghiaccio con una ragazza che musica ascolti? 
Ah, ci vado pazza per chi? 
Per il rap? 
No, per Baglioni 
E giù a ricordarsi 2000 canzoni 
Canzoni che abbiamo ascoltato e ballato quel palco
Che sogno da quando son nato 
I pezzi legati ai cantanti e ai loro miti 
Alcuni più vivi che mai, altri finiti 
Ma sempre rimane l'affetto per quella voce 
Che in giorni di buio mi accendeva una luce 
È sempre la stessa canzone che cambia 
È sempre la stessa canzone che cambia 
La faccia e quella più bella 
Non è detto mica che piaccia la musica, musica
Musica apre le porte 
E fa diventare ogni giorno la vita più forte 
E come una penna che ti sottolinea le cose che quelle più
Ricche alla fine non sono costose 
Io che alla musica un po' mi ci sono sposato 
Sorrido perché ancora non mi ha abbandonato",E' Sempre La Stessa Canzone Che Va

A 2 passi dal Vaticano
Sotto un albero di souvenirs
Democratico e cristiano
Sono nato nella giungla
Delle raccomandazioni
Quelle fatte alla Madonna
E ai politici imbroglioni
Benvenuti nella giungla
Benvenuti nella giungla
Sono nato dove il sacro
Va a passeggio col profano
Dove l'anima si salverà
Ma ha bisogno di una mano
Dove anche Gesù Cristo
Che era un tipo eccezionale
Sembra essersi alleato
Con qualcuno al quirinale
E combatte fianco a fianco
Per la legge finanziaria
Solo perché quel ministro
Possa darsi qualche aria
Benvenuti nella giungla
Benvenuti nella giungla
Nella giungla c'è un casino
C'è una grande confusione
Gli sciacalli hanno il potere
E combattono il leone
Perché il re è vecchio e sfinito
L'atmosfera è di anarchia
Non c'è più nessun rispetto
E nessuna garanzia
Benvenuti nella giungla
Benvenuti nella giungla
Questa giungla è casa nostra
Non vogliamo più violenza
Ma per tutti I prepotenti
Non vogliamo indifferenza
Guarda quello che hanno fatto
Alla gente che s'è arresa
Certe volte un pugno in faccia
È legittima difesa

Jovanotti,"Estate 1992 anno dell'Europa Unita delle mie delle tue vacanze
Come ogni caldo agosto
In giro per l'Italia a farci il culo arrosto
Dove andiamo? Ostia Fregene Rimini Riccione
Un'altra abbronzatura ed un'altra canzone
Legata ad una storia d'amore passeggera
Nata sopra il bagno-asciuga è già finita la sera
Dell'addio del ci sentiamo, ti penso, ti chiamo
Scrivimi, ricordati, ti prego, ti amo
Estate 1992 l'estate delle mie delle tue vacanze
Automobili giù tutti i finestrini
Anche i più grandi che ritornan bambini
E il gioco prende sopravvento sulle cose serie
Ed il lavoro si trasforma, si trasforma in ferie
Lo studio, lo studio diventa vacanza
E il cielo è li che ti aspetta fuori dalla stanza
Ma che caldo ma che caldo ma che caldo fa
Ma che caldo in questa città
Cinquecento anni fa Cristoforo Colombo
Volle fare una vacanza in giro per il mondo
Fu il primo ad arrivare negli Stati Uniti
Che prima di allora non si eran mai sentiti
Importò il rock il jazz e anche jeans sdruciti
Le patate con gli hamburger ed una cifra di miti
Che ogni estate ci raffioran dalla radio e TV
Però adesso porco cane non se ne può più
E nell'anniversario della scoperta americana
Qui da noi torna di moda la musica italiana
Ma che caldo ma che caldo ma che caldo fa
Ma che caldo in questa città
Finiscono le scuole si apre la stagione
Delle minigonne storiche del gavettone
Sulle magliette bianche sulle camicette
E l'effetto del bagnato che evidenzia le tette
L'estate delle tette messe sotto inchiesta
Della tetta artificiale e della tetta onesta
Ma per noi va tutto bene non sottilizziamo
Noi amiamo tutto quello che ci porta lontano da qui
Dalla storia tristemente nota in tutta la terra
La mafia il razzismo l'aids e la guerra
Purtroppo sono cose vere
Purtroppo queste cose non vanno in ferie
Buone vacanze comunque a chiunque, ovunque, comunque, qualunque, perunque, ovunque
In questo momento sta' muovendosi un poco
Che possa essere un estate di fuoco
Estate 1992 anno dell'Europa Unita delle mie delle tue vacanze

Jovanotti,"Ho perso la direzione
Non c'è più religione 
Non lo so non lo so hanno tutti ragione 
A sentirli chiacchierare dalla televisione 
Andreotti che ogni frase ti ci mette una battuta 
Con il pubblico che applaude anche se non l'ha capita 
Craxi che mi sembra Mussolini 
Con l'atteggiamento del papà coi propri bambini 
Ma io il padre ce l'ho e mi accontento di lui io 
Non ci capisco niente spiegatemelo voi 

Ho perso la direzione
PDS, PCI comunisti 
Oppure no chi mi dice rinnovati 
Chi mi dice però però però le radici 
La foglia delle querce 
Mi sembra che qualcuno voglia vendermi una merce 
Ma le idee son cose serie 
Non voglio acquistare 
Vorrei capire 
Vorrei capire 
Il partito della destra 
Che paura ragazzi 
Sentir parlare di passato mi sembrano pazzi 
Eppure la dialettica è un'arma tagliente 
Che colpisce come sempre il popolo ignorante
Come me che non son re 
Ma che vorrei imparare 
Ma che più mi do un motivo 
Più li mando a cagare 

Ho perso la direzione
Pannella che mi sembra una persona intelligente 
Anche lui con le parole sa convincere la gente 
Ma però poi si sputtana quando è alle conclusioni 
E io che torno ad ascoltare delle belle canzoni 

Ho perso la direzione
Cerco di farmi un'idea ed ascolto i liberali 
Che mi sembrano persone oneste e pure regolari 
Poi mi accorgo che tra loro c'è Sgarbi Vittorio 
Che vorrebbe esser presente anche a Montecitorio 
Ma a me lui sta sul cazzo pur essendo intelligente
E non credo che lui faccia del bene alla gente 
Lui che parla parla e spara 
Commenta e spara 
Vedo un'ombra di violenza la sua faccia non è chiara 

Ho perso la direzione
Questa Lega è una vergogna canta Pino Daniele 
Eppure questa Lega viaggia a gonfie vele 
Ma io credo che in Italia forse faccio un errore tra la gente 
E tra i ragazzi ci sia un filo conduttore 
Non credo sia possibile riuscire a tagliare 
Quindi la Lega non la riesco a votare 
Come non voto per Moana 
E non perché è una puttana 
Ma perché non penso sia un esempio di italiana 
Le italiane amano il sesso ma a letto fan l'amore 
Non lo fanno per i soldi lo fanno col cuore 
E poi ci sono le altre 1500 fazioni 
Che partecipano ad accrescere le nostre tensioni 
E le mie idee confuse idee poco chiare 
Che mi spingono a restare a casa invece di votare 
Ma così farei lo sporco gioco di quegli stessi 
Che si ingrassano alle spalle dell'Italia dei fessi 

Ho perso la direzione 
Certe volte alla TV, che so al telegiornale 
Quando vedo quelle madri ve lo giuro sto male 
Quelle storie di ragazzi morti in sale da gioco 
Dove un soldo vale molto 
E una vita vale poco 
Prego e penso ai miei amici ai miei fratelli e sorelle 
Penso a quegli innamorati insieme sotto le stelle 
Penso che se ami tua madre 
E non la puoi non amare questa violenza non la puoi accettare 
E di fronte a tutto questo un voto non vale 
Niente ma è importante che impariamo a voler bene alla gente 
Non importa sulla scheda io che cazzo ci metto è importante 
Il rispetto il rispetto 
Non importa sulla scheda io che cazzo ci scrivo 
È importante che ogni uomo abbia diritto ad esser vivo",Ho Perso la Direzione
Jovanotti,"(Non sei andata via, non sei andata via
Non è colpa mia, è che non va via)

Ragazze, voi mi fate impazzire
E con questo rap io ve lo voglio dire
E non lo faccio così tanto per fare il ruffiano
Ma parlo nel microfono con il cuore in mano
E specialmente adesso che ho raggiunto un età

(Dai cuori no, non si va più via)
Che mi permette di apprezzare con semplicità
La bellezza e le caratteristiche diverse
Delle donne ritrovate, delle donne perse

(Sono scatole perfette)
Tra il pensiero di piacere e quello di innamorarsi

(In cui ritrovi sempre tutto)
Tra la voglia di una fuga e quella di sposarsi
Di far l'amore con tutti quelli che ti pare
O di sceglierti un uomo e di portarlo all'altare

(Dalla mente, dalla mente mia)
E di fronte a questo dubbio, a questo combattimento
I vostri occhi mi riempiono di sentimento
Quando io vi vedo sole, in mezzo a tanta gente
Nel rumore di una musica che non vale niente
Se non fosse accompagnata dai tuoi movimenti
Che ci accendono la carica, volenti o nolenti
E noi che grazie a quel serpente
Vi giriamo intorno
A cercare nella notte un attimo di giorno

(Ai cuori no, non si va più via)
Per parlare con gli amici di parole condite
Da concetti, da espressioni, eh, colorite

(E non c'è niente da capire)
Tra l'amore e il sesso, il corpo e la mente

(Non c'è niente da spiegare)
Per concludere che in fondo in fondo è divertente

(Perché l'amore non ha parole)
Il continuo dondolare di tutte le cose

(E poi ti toglie anche la voce)
Questa falsa divisione tra puttane e spose

(Ah, ma le storie d'amore
No, non finiscono mai)
Non finiscono mai, non finiscono mai, non finiscono mai mai

(Ah, ma le storie d'amore)
Non finiscono mai, non finiscono mai, non finiscono mai mai

(No, non finiscono mai)
Non finiscono mai, non finiscono mai, non finiscono mai mai
 
Ragazze, voi mi fate impazzire
A partire dalla mamma fino ad arrivare
Al concetto, quello mistico, della Madonna
Figlia, madre, moglie, fidanzata, sorella e nonna
Sempre dentro un di questa categorie
Che fa cadere la mia mente le ragazze mie

(Finisce si, finisce e si va via)
E io con questo lungo rap, io vi racconto tutto
Anche se in certi momenti può sembrarvi brutto
Ma io ascolto tanta musica, mattina e sera

(Amore forse solo una bugia)
La stagione che amo di più, la primavera
Quando sbocciano sugli alberi, i germogli dei fiori
E la gente ricomincia a stare un po' più fuori

(La bugia più grande)
E le ragazze di città prendono il motorino

(La più vera che ci sia)
E si siedono proprio sul bordo del sellino
E coi capelli sciolti gridano
Con aria sicura

(Amore mio
Che non ho amato mai)
E guardandole, la vita sembra meno dura
E quel sole che le illumina e le fa più belle
In quel giorno sarei il re di tutte le altre stelle
E il pensiero vola e va a posarsi sul davanzale
 
(Non smetterò
Di amarti mai)
Di una casa, sul confine tra il bene e il male
Tra l'amore, il sesso, il corpo e la mente
Per concludere che in fondo in fondo è divertente

(Non smetterò di perderti)
Il continuo dondolare di tutte le cose

(Di difenderti da me)
Questa falsa divisione tra puttane e spose

(Ah, le storie d'amore)
Non finiscono mai, non finiscono mai, non finiscono mai mai

(No, non finiscono mai)
Non finiscono mai, non finiscono mai, non finiscono mai mai

Jovanotti,"Sono io, sono io, quello di ""è qui la festa""
Quello con il cappellino quello senza la testa
Dovevate farmi fuori 6 anni fa
Se volevate la tranquillità
E invece sono qui vivo e ancora parlante
Questo è il nostro 5° album
Non sono un cantante
Faccio il rap, quella musica dura
Quella senza melodia, quella che fa paura, paura
Ma dove andremo a finire
Ma guarda un po' cosa ci tocca sentire
E intanto mentre sto parlando il rap è entrato in Italia
Questo genere del quale io mi sento una balia
Senza false modestie questo LP
Esce in un momento dove finalmente anche qui
Il rap ha assunto dimensioni oltre la curiosità
E coinvolge gente di tutte le età
Finalmente si muove
Finalmente una ventata di compagini nuove
Il ragazzo con un giradischi e un campionatore
Un cervello per pensare, organizza il rumore
E ci dice sopra a tempo tutto quello che pensa
Musica incazzata contro la violenza

Raap, raap

Il rap, i nuovi cantautori
Senza chitarre ma con tanti rumori
E tante idee da dire più o meno intelligenti
Chuck D (bass!) illumina le menti
E fa che crescano i ragazzi aria di rinnovamento
E grazie a questo asfalto un nuovo rinascimento
Come quello che ha ridato forza ai neri americani
Fa che succeda anche per quelli italiani
Alla faccia di San Remo, delle televisioni
Comunichiamoci le nostre emozioni

Raap, raap

Sono io, sono io, a parlare di questo
Io che ho fatto sia San Remo che Fantastico e il resto
Sono io, perché ho un microfono potente
E voglio dire ciò che penso alla gente
E ai ragazzi che si perdono in mille confusioni
Comunichiamoci le nostre emozioni
Attraverso ogni canale usiamo questo linguaggio
E cominciamo a darci qualche messaggio
La musica rinasce nelle strade tra i banchi
Il rap che parla ai neri, ai bianchi
Io ci credo e tu lo sai, tu che storci il tuo naso
Ma son più saggio e non ci faccio caso
 
Raap, raap

Il rap per società multirazziali
Dove tutti nei diritti e nei doveri sono uguali
Musica che nasce dalle ceneri del rock
Della musica elettronica, ed è uno shock
Per molti una sirena su un disco
Ma a me mi piace ed impazzisco
Per tutto ciò che mi stimola un po'
Non so domani che cosa ascolterò
Ma oggi la mia testa è aperta come non mai
Pronto a partire se tu mi seguirai
Impara le parole, inventane di nuove
Incontra i tuoi amici e fate delle prove
La musica è la cosa più bella che c'è
Muoviti, muoviti, muoviti man!
Muoviti, muoviti, muoviti man!",Il Rap
Jovanotti,"Sai qual è il problema
Che poi non è un problema
Che quando io sto bene non c'è niente che io tema
E so per esperienza qui la rappo e qui lo scrivo
Com'è difficile fermarsi e dire ""preservativo""
Aspettami piccina un minuto solamente
È facile che l'animale l'abbia vinta sulla mente
Ma devo tener duro e lottare con ardore
Un tempo erano piattole adesso si muore
È dura ma è possibile anche per noi che lo facciamo
Perché fare l'amore è ancora il massimo che abbiamo
Adeguarsi ai nuovi metodi per vivere 100 anni
Cancellando tradizioni e miti vivi da millenni
Inserendo un terzo incomodo di gomma puzzolente
Per amore di se stessi e per rispetto della gente
Un ragazzo è spesso teso a pensare solo a se stesso
Specialmente se gli capita una storia di sesso
Ma le cose stan cambiando è ancora lungo il cammino
È la festa nazionale con la data del vaccino
E della sua grande scoperta è ancora lontana
Sia per chi va con la santa che per chi va con la puttana
C'è chi dice che è un flagello una pena da scontare
Una mossa della chiesa che non vuol farci scopare
Una piaga che punisce solamente i peggiori
Che con quello che combinano forse è meglio farli fuori
E ci pensa allora lui, il nostro virus giustiziere
Che colpisce chi non sa come far uso del sedere
E questo pregiudizio contribuisce a fondo
A far si che il bastardo vada in giro per il mondo
A far si che il bastardo vada in giro per la terra
A seminare morte come fa solo la guerra
La chiesa dal suo canto ci da il suo contributo
Perché il virus dell'AIDS si trasmetta indisturbato
Ancora che condanna la contraccezione
E giù con gli anatemi contro la nazione
Io penso che l'amore sia tutto nella vita
E sono fortunati quelli che han la fidanzata
E si amano da pazzi e faranno 100 figli
E nella loro storia non avranno mai sbadigli
Però purtroppo oggi non è sempre Natale
E a volte ti succede che le storie vanno male
E allora si va in giro e si hanno delle storie
E capita che a volte si finisce a fare l'amore
Anche senza coronare con il sentimento puro
E allora se c'è il sesso almeno fa che sia sicuro
E non pensare che riguardi solamente certa gente
Riguarda tutti noi sintonizza la tua mente
Son sicuro che Dio c'è non si spiegherebbe il vento
Ma però sono anche certo che arriva il momento
Che noi povere creature dobbiam darci una mossa
Se vogliamo ritardare il nostro sonno nella fossa
Perché Dio c'ha dato il via poi ha detto ""vai figliolo
Adesso la tua storia te la tiri su da solo""
Con gli ostacoli del caso certi giorni ed altri meno
Che rannuvolano il cielo che non sia troppo sereno
Per esempio prendi l'AIDS, al di là di tutti I morti
Ha portato tutti noi poveri cristi ai ferri corti
E la mia generazione è cresciuta sessualmente
Con lo spettro del bacillo sempre intorno alla sua mente
Deve dire a tutti quanti ""oh ragazzi state attenti
Fatelo quanto volete ma siate previdenti""
Magic Johnson lui è un mito uno sceso dalla luna
Ma di fronte a questo mal non ti serve la fortuna
Freddie Mercury che voce anche lui finito male
Per capire come viaggia fatti un giro in ospedale
Questo virus è un bastardo ma non deve aver la meglio
Guarda bene dove vai apri gli occhi resta sveglio
La mia generazione e quella di altra gente
All'idea di questo rischio sintonizza la sua mente
Io nel mio piccolino qui la rappo e qui la scrivo
Quando non conosco a fondo metto su il preservativo",Sai Qual È il Problema

Ma chi l'ha detta questa cazzata
Che basta un soffio di vento più forte
Per dire ciao e per farla finita
Con le nostre menate le manie e il progresso
Basta uno spunto e lo butti nel cesso
Tutto quello che oggi sembra la verità
Domani forse neanche lo ricorderemo
Compriamo tutto senza guardare i conti
Chissà domani quanto pagheremo, eh?
Homo sapiens padrone della terra
Quanto ti piace fare la guerra?
N po' di sangue da un po' di colore
Non si può vivere di solo amore
Del resto con la storia del peccato originale
C'hanno insegnato che tra noi e il male
C'è una certa simpatia diciamo un'influenza
E allora vai con un po' di violenza
Domenica allo stadio uno spettacolo divino
Vedere il sangue scorrere come il vino
E le facce dei ragazzi tinte d'ignoranza
Perdute nella folla in una macabra danza
Che fan venire i brividi ma in fondo ci piace
Ma sai che palle vivere in pace
E com'è bello nella formula uno
Vedere alla partenza che si schianta qualcuno
E allora visto che non puoi farne senza
E allora vai con un po' di violenza
E allora vai con un po' di violenza
E allora si, facciamo del male
Del resto l'uomo lo si vede dovunque
È il più violento e feroce animale
A chi gli piace la pena di morte
A chi gli piace picchiare la gente
A chi gli piace il regime guidato
Da gente pazza e malata di mente
Anch'io ciò voglia di un po' di violenza
Ma la violenza che io preferisco
È quella che arriva da una chitarra distorta
E quella fatta scretchando col disco
E allora vai con un po' di violenza
Con la chitarra e la batteria
La mia violenza è un antidoto al male
La mia violenza si chiama energia
E allora visto che non puoi farne senza
E allora vai con un po' di violenza
E allora vai con un po' di violenza
E allora vai con un po' di violenza
Ma la violenza che io preferisco
È quella fatta scretchando col disco
L'unica sola che io concepisco
È solo quella che ascolto su un disco",Vai un Pò Di Violenza
Jovanotti,"Il mio nome è lorenzo potrebbe non aver senso 
Ma da quando sono nato dico quello che penso 
Dico quello che vedo mi guardo in giro utilizzo 
Questo ritmo nero e funky e duro e carico di 
Bassi e su di lui io costruisco sintassi e frasi
E storie strada dove vivo muovi la mano con 
La quale io scrivo e dammi la carica dammi 
L'energia molta cattiveria poca melodia

Un due tre via un due tre via questa non vuole 
Essere una forma di poesia ma è rap semplicemente 
Senza pretese un suono e una parola che arriva 
Palese e ti muove e non c'è discussione non è 
La musica che fa la rivoluzione al massimo può 
Essere una colonna sonora un modo per accendere 
Un passaparola microfono si accende va su 
L'adrenalina attaccamilaspina

Chiamala come ti pare chiamala arte chiamala 
Chiasso questa è la mia parola che si fonde 
Col basso è il suono cittadino del rap e del 
Funky e no che no ti stanchi ritmo e parola 
Pane e companatico supercalifragilisti suono 
Molto pratico e violento al cento per cento 
Muove la mia dialettica con il divertimento 
E mi fa venire voglia di dire ""alza alza""

Ascolta il suono del basso che incalza; la musica 
Che faccio mi serve come scudo mi barrico dietro 
Al microfono per non sentirmi nudo di fronte alla 
Mia insicurezza non ho né presunzione né manie di 
Grandezza non faccio né comizi né falsa demagogia 
Io sono un accumulatore di energia che poi ritorna 
Fuori sotto forma di adrenalina tacatacamilaspina
Facci vedere cosa sai fare facci sentire cosa sai fare 

So fare poco, ma ciò che faccio provo a farlo ben
Semino il seme del frutto raro dello stare insieme 
Organizzo feste in giro per la mia nazione sono un 
Guerriero della comunicazione la musica va avanti 
E io gli vado appresso se pure questo ritmo sembra 
Sempre lo stesso è qui che io mi sento come fossi 
A casa mia io sono un accumulatore d'energia che 
Poi ritorna fuori sotto forma d'adrenalina 
Attaccamilaspina",Attaccami la Spina

Sono un ballerino
Passo le mie ore ballando
Passo dopo passo 
Seguo il basso e ballo
Tengo il tempo
E mi rendo strumento
Sull'accento 
Di una ritmica jazz
Senza stress

Improvviso sul tema
Senza problema
Mi espongo ai miei rischi
Saranno applausi oppure saranno fischi? 
Non so

Perch sono un ballerino

Sabato arriva il mio momento
Sono un ballerino e trovo gran godimento 
Nelle discoteche tra la folla annoiata
Ed in fila davanti all'entrata 
Fotomodelle come carne al macello
Dividono un mar rosso con sapor di bordello 
La folla che si apre al passare di una diva
Di qualche telepromozione televisiva 
Si richiude proprio mentre sto passando anch'io
E mi ritrovo perso nell'oblio 
Espresso dalla musica dei deejay

E non riesco a fare neanche uno dei passi miei 
Ma mi dicono "" gi tanto che sei riuscito ad entrare""
""non vorrai mica ballerino ballare?""
Io sono un ballerino di jazz
Io sono un ballerino di jazz
Sono un ballerino di jazz
Sono un ballerino
Sono un ballerino faccio passi di tango
Di salsa, di funky, di rock e di mambo 
La musica tutto per me, la mia vita
Per me la metafora mia preferita

La musica dio, nota e armonia
La musica ordine la musica anarchia!

Jovanotti,"Ho gi visto quelle facce, quelle espressioni
In piazza del duomo dopo le elezioni
Son le stesse che gridavan ""barabba! barabba!""
""barabba! barabba!"" ""barabba! barabba!""
Ho gi visto quelle facce in piazza venezia
Quando il duce parlava affacciato al balcone
Le ho riviste poco dopo in piazzale loreto
Quella stessa fottuta espressione
Io conosco quelle facce che bruciavan la strega
Le ho riviste rosse in faccia che gridavano ""lega!""
Aggredire con violenza un passante regolare

Che quel giorno non aveva un cazzo da festeggiare
Ho gi visto quelle facce in un autobus pieno
Dallo stadio ritornare affacciati al finestrino
Insultare, sputare, prendere a calci un bidone
Ho gi visto quelle facce, quell'espressione
La stessa che gridava ""barabba! barabba!""
""barabba! barabba!"" ""barabba! barabba!""
Ho gi visto quelle facce a un concerto a torino
Aggredire con insulti un cantante italiano
Che cantava per il rispetto dei diritti dell'uomo

Le ho riviste l'altra sera in piazza del duomo
Ho gi visto quella faccia in uno specchio riflessa
E l'ho odiata e s' odiata con tutta se stessa
La faccia di una massa che ha bisogno di eroi
Che assecondino comodamente I vizi suoi
Ho gi visto quella faccia e la vedr ancora
In un'altra piazza, in un'altra ora
Con un altro slogan con un'altra battaglia
Con un'altra fottutissima coda di paglia
Ho gi visto quella faccia
Ho gi visto quella faccia

La stessa che gridava ""barabba! barabba!""
""barabba! barabba!"" ""barabba! barabba!""
Nel mio palazzo ci abita un signore anziano
Da ragazzo quel signore stato un partigiano
Nei suoi occhi c' lo sguardo di chi ha visto tanto
Di chi ha visto la gioia, di chi ha visto il pianto
La sua faccia che la storia vuol dimenticare
La faccia che io invece voglio ricordare
Ogni volta che sar tentato di dar ragione
A quel primo che mi passa con la soluzione

Espressione di una massa che ha bisogno di eroi
Che assecondino comodamente I vizi suoi
Ma la faccia scomoda dei bimbi africani
La fierezza negli sguardi degli uomini cubani
Un cazzotto che ci giudica continuamente
E dice cerca di essere uomo prima di essere gente! 
Cerca di essere uomo prima di essere gente! 
Cerca di essere uomo prima di essere gente!

Lo spazio pi prezioso che non teme cedimenti 
Beato chi divide la capanna con due cuori

Jovanotti,"Questo
Quello che dichiaro in questo testo 
Mi rappresenta ma voglio essere onesto 
La confusione non si risolve con la canzone
Ma per lo meno ci fa passare un po' di tempo in piedi 
Ballare può servire se ci credi 
Sarà il più primitivo dei rimedi 
La danza della pioggia degli indiani 
Danze tribali come gli africani 
Un filo che ci lega ai cantastorie 
Per non dimenticare le memorie 
Aggiungeremo al media che ci investe 
Le nostre teste le nostre teste 
Saremo un arcipelago di idee
Resisteremo a piogge e maree 
Riprodurremo il fuoco sull'asfalto 
Potrà sembrare un urlo e qualche salto 
Ma è sangue, corpo, anima e intelletto 
Un suono primitivo e benedetto 
Irrompe nelle strade e nelle radio 
Nelle tivù nelle scuole allo stadio 
L'esercito sarà degli insicuri 
Cuori confusi e sguardi da duri
Lo scriverò a graffiti sui muri 
Perché la mente non si riposa 

Dobbiamoinventarciqualcosa 

Dobbiamo inventarci qualcosa perché così non si può andare avanti 
C'è troppa distanza tra noi, e siamo troppo distanti 
Succede che il non conoscersi spesso genera la paura 
E spinge all'isolamento tra queste solite quattro mura 
Ma facendo I conti con il disordine spesso si ottiene la soluzione 
Le dissonanze che si organizzano fanno nascere una canzone 

Dobbiamoinventarciqualcosa 
Ma che 
Amico non chiederlo a me 
Dobbiamoinventarciqualcosa 
Ma che
Amico non chiederlo a me 

Io di vita conosco soltanto la mia le altre le vedo passare 
Le leggo attraverso la mia verità ed e' per questo che non posso giudicare 
So solo che quando la strada finisce c'è un bivio dentro al tuo cuore 
E se decidi di andare avanti devi fare l'esploratore 
E il fatto di non sapere assolutamente dove va il mondo 
Mi spinge a guardarmi dentro cercando di andare più in fondo
Più in fondo, più in fondo, più in fondo
Cercando attraverso un viaggio di conoscenza di ciò che sono 
Di fare qualcosa di buono, di fare qualcosa di buono 

Dobbiamoinventarciqualcosa 
Ma che
Amico non chiederlo a me 
Dobbiamoinventarciqualcosa 
Ma che
Amico non chiederlo a me 

""Divide et impera"", chi l'ha detto ha interpretato la nostra storia 
Ci han regalato un viaggio nel futuro in cambio della nostra memoria 
Ma dobbiamo inventarci qualcosa, in senso stretto stretto ed in senso lato 
Dobbiamo inventarci qualcosa visto che tutto quanto è stato già inventato 
Dovremmo servirci forse di quello che la natura crea 
Ci vuole una grande idea, ci vuole una grande idea 
Questo sound mi fa venire in mente di come io stavo quando 
Ero ancora nella pancia di mia mamma e stavo già ballando 
Protetto da quell'involucro dove non mi mancava niente 

Ricercare quell'atmosfera stasera può essere divertente 
Ritrovo il mio cordone ombelicale 
Risalgo fino al brodo primordiale 
Di lì ricostruisco la mia storia 
Per non dimenticare la mia memoria 
La musica mi aiuterà a parlare 
A comunicare, a comunicare 
Perché la mente non si riposa

Vedervi dire sempre di no non lo so, non lo so ma ti droghi fai
Veder le braccia ma che razza di faccia non mi piace per niente

Che tuo padre ed io non ti vogliamo bene? sempre le stesse scene
Ogni giorno ogni sera quella stessa atmosfera. mentre mio padre

Mi vedeva crescere lui mi sembrava non potesse invecchiare mentre
Crescevo tre centimetri l'anno lui era sempre uguale mi ricordo a
Dodici anni un pomeriggio di sole mi portò a un funerale ma era
Uno speciale che non see'era neanche un morto parente neanche un
Conoscente solo un sacco di gente seria molto composta una specie
Di festa al contrario e mio padre mario mi diceva quando avrai un
Po' più anni potrai dire io see'ero ai funerali degli agenti della
Scorta di moro questa sera quasi ventisette anni sto leggendo il
Giornale e di quel funerale mi risale l'immagine in mente e ho
Chiarissimo in testa quel concetto di festa al contrario e di mio

Padre mario che per come era sempre severo mi appariva sincero
Nel dolore del restare impotente insieme a molta altra gente che
Sostava di fronte al potere di pochi sulla vita di molti e a quei
Volti sconvolti delle madri delle mogli dei parenti e dei figli
Degli agenti della scorta di moro e mio padre mario era così
Serio e mi teneva sulla testa una mano quel pomeriggio è lontano
Quasi venti anni fa I negozi che chiudevano in tutta la città
Ogni cosa era strana nella mia fantasia non capivo perché in
Giro see'era tutta quella polizia le sirene spiegate le serrande
Abbassate sono più grande ma le cose non sono cambiate la mia
Mano è più grande e mio padre più anziano la mia mamma si
Preoccupa perché sono lontano. questa storia che ho detto con la
Rima baciata non so forse neanche io perché ve l'ho raccontata

Forse il centro di tutto è quella mano che mio padre mi appoggiò
Sulla testa questo è quanto mi resta un ricordo profondo grande
Come il mondo questo gesto che mio padre ebbe il cuore di fare
Questo gesto d'amore mille volte più potente di un pugno in
Questa notte di giugno in cui scrivo mi fa essere vivo pronto ad
Essere padre a mia volta e a spiegare a mio figlio bambino come
Ogni destino si unisce si confonde e si intreccia in comune con
Le altre persone gli dirò che ogni schiaffo e ogni pugno che è

Piove, senti come piove
Madonna come piove, senti come viene giu 
Piove, senti come piove
Madonna come piove, senti come viene giu 

Hai visto che piove, senti come viene giu
Tu che dicevi che non pioveva piu
Che ormai non ti saresti mai piu innamorata 
E adesso guardati sei tutta bagnata
E piove madonna come piove sulla tua testa
E l'aria si rinfresca
E piovera fin quando la terra non sara di nuovo
Piena e poi si rasserena 

Piove, senti come piove
Madonna come piove, senti come viene giu 
Piove, senti come piove
Madonna come piove, senti come viene giu 

Senti le gocce che battono sul tetto
Senti il rumore girandoti nel letto 
Rinascera sta gia nascendo ora
Senti che piove e il grano si matura 
E tu diventi grande e ti fai forte
E quelle foglie che ti sembravan morte
Ripopolano I rami un'altra volta
E la primavera che bussa alla tua porta
E piove madonna come piove
Prima che il sole ritorni a farci festa 
Senti, senti come piove
Senti le gocce battere sulla tua testa 

Piove, senti come piove
Madonna come piove, senti come viene giu 
Piove, senti come piove
Madonna come piove, senti come viene giu 
Piove, senti come piove
Madonna come piove, senti come viene giu 
Piove, senti come piove
Madonna come piove, senti come viene giu 

Tu che credevi che oramai le tue piantine 
S'eran seccate e non sarebbero cresciute piu 
Hai aspettato un po' ma senti come piove
Sulla tua testa senti come viene giu 
Non eri tu che ormai ti eri rassegnata 
E che dicevi che non ti saresti piu innamorata 
La terra a volte va innaffiata con il pianto
Ma poi vedrai la pioggia tornera 

Piove, senti come piove
Madonna come piove, senti come viene giu 
Piove, senti come piove

Jovanotti,"Se t'incontro per strada non riesco a parlarti
Mi si bloccano le parole non riesco a guardarti
Negli occhi mi sembra di impazzire
Se potessi amplificare
Il battito del mio cuore sentiresti
Un batterista di una band di metallo pesante
Ed è per questo che sono qui davanti
Perché mi viene molto più facile cantarti una canzone
Magari che la sentano i muri e le persone

Piuttosto che telefonarti e dirti tutto faccia a faccia
Rischiando di fare una figuraccia
Sono timido ma l'amore mi dà coraggio
Per dirti che da quando io ti ho visto è sempre maggio
E a maggio il mondo è bello e invitante di colori
Ma ancora sugli alberi ci sono solo fiori
Che prima o poi si dice diverranno pure frutti
E allora tu che fai? golosamente aspetti

Aspetti che quel desiderio venga condiviso
Io sono qui davanti che ti chiedo un sorriso
Affacciati alla finestra amore mio

Affacciati al balcone rispondimi al citofono
Sono venuto qui col giradischi e col microfono
Insieme al mio complesso per cantarti il sentimento
E se tu mi vorrai baciare sarò contento
E questa serenata è la mia sfida col destino
Vorrei che per la vita noi due fossimo vicino
Una serenata rap per dirti che di te
Mi piace come mi guardi mi piace come sei con me
Mi piace quel tuo naso che s'intona con il mondo
Mi piace il tuo sedere così rotondo
Da rendere satellite ogni essere vivente
Mi piaci perché sei intelligente
Si vede dalle tue mani come le muovi
Mi provochi pensieri e sentimenti sempre nuovi
Nei tuoi fianchi sono le Alpi nei tuoi seni le Dolomiti
Mi piace quel tuo gusto nello scegliere i vestiti
Quel tuo essere al di sopra delle mode del momento
Sei un fiore che è cresciuto sull'asfalto e sul cemento

Affacciati alla finestra amore mio
Affacciati alla finestra amore mio
Affacciati alla finestra amore mio
Affacciati alla finestra amore mio

Serenata rap serenata metropolitana
Mettiti con me non sarò un figlio di puttana
Non ci credere alle cose che ti dicono di me
Sono tutti un po' invidiosi chissà perché
Io non ti prometto storie di passioni da copione
Di cinema, romanzi e che ne so di una canzone
Io ti offro verità corpo anima e cervello
Amore solamente amore solo solo quello

Affacciati alla finestra amore mio
Affacciati alla finestra amore mio
Affacciati alla finestra amore mio
Affacciati alla finestra amore mio

Amor che a nullo amato amar perdona porco cane
Lo scriverò sui muri e sulle metropolitane
Di questa città milioni di abitanti
Che giorno dopo giorno ignorandosi vanno avanti
E poi chissà perché perché chissà
Per come nessuno sa perché perché chissà
Per come due sguardi in un momento sovrappongono un destino
Palazzi, asfalto e smog si trasformano in giardino
Persone consacrate dallo scambio di un anello
E un monolocale che diventerà un castello
Affacciati alla finestra amore mio

Nei tuoi fianchi sono le Alpi nei tuoi seni le Dolomiti
Mi piace quel tuo gusto nello scegliere i vestiti
Questo essere al di sopra delle mode del momento
Sei un fiore che è cresciuto sull'asfalto e sul cemento

Affacciati alla finestra amore mio
Affacciati alla finestra amore mio
Affacciati alla finestra amore mio
Affacciati alla finestra amore mio

Affacciati alla finestra amore mio
Affacciati alla finestra amore mio
Affacciati alla finestra amore mio

Jovanotti,"Sono un deejay che lavora in diversi locali 
Frequentati da ragazzi più o meno normali magari 
Che lavorano durante la settimana o che abitano 
Magari in qualche zona lontana da questa discoteca 
Che al sabato sera è l'unico locale dove c'è un'atmosfera 
Un po' giusta arriva un po' di gente potrebbe trasformarsi 
In una storia divertente allora via si va via si va si va 
Via qualcuno c'ha la macchina qualcuno l'energia intesa in 
Tanti modi, quello dipende ognuno può affrontare la notte 
Che scende nel modo che gli pare gli piace e gli pare allora 
È un altro sabato che sta per cominciare però però però non
C'è niente da dire la voglia di far festa e quella di 

Fuggire da quando il mondo è mondo si possono incontrare 
E c'è qualcuno che sceglie di andare a ballare da me che 
Metto su la musica più forte che c'è e allora c'è qualcuno
Che per venire da me si fa cento chilometri e io che posso 
Fare quando li vedo qui li faccio ballare li prendo e me li 
Porto dietro fino al sole e tutto il resto sono parole sono 
Un digei vedo molto io dall'alto di questi piatti ne ho viste 
Io di cose io ne ho visti di fatti ho visto una signora 
Ingioiellata far la figa ho visto un entra ed esci per pipparsi 
Qualche riga che finisce dentro al naso di un figlio di papà che 
Si nasconde dentro all'università ; ho visto uomini baciarsi tra 

Di loro con affetto e coppie miste che non vanno più d'accordo 
Neanche a letto, ho visto dei politici arrivare con la scorta li 
Ho visti strafottenti mentre fan la mano morta alla bionda con la
Minigonna con un sogno nel cassetto ed ho saputo di quel sogno 
Addormentarsi dentro al letto ; ma più di ogni altra cosa ho visto
Gente regolare che veniva qui a ballare, a rimorchiare vivendo 
Questo tempo in modo attivo ma anche onesto ognuno nel suo mondo 
E son parole tutto il resto parole che però mi piacerebbe raccontare 
In questo sabato che sta per cominciare 
E allora via si va via si va si va via in culo a questa notte e 
Pure alla polizia la strada la conosco e questa macchina di papa'
Stasera che ho bevuto sembra che vada la meta' 

E io che da dieci anni torno a casa a quest'ora all'ora che di 
Solito la gente poi lavora girando le statali dalla uno alla mille 
Ho visto tante macchine poi far le scintille con la carrozzeria 
Che grattava il catrame ho visto le lamiere diventare come lame 
Sull'asfalto ho visto macchine come lattine d'aranciata accartocciarsi
Intorno a un albero dopo una sbandata e allora non c'è sabato che 
In una provinciale non c'è lo stronzo che mi sorpassa male in 
Curva sulla destra mi passa a centottanta diretto verso il buio 
Di questi anni novanta e io sono un deejay e il lunedì c'ho la 
Nausea non posso poi non chiedermi qual è la causa, ma poi me ne 
Dimentico e in fondo son sincero a quello del sorpasso io dedico 
Un pensiero, pensiero di fratello pensiero un po' tetro è brutto 
Quando sbagli non poter tornare indietro; ripenso a tutti I miti 
Della gioventù bruciata al mito dell'eccesso alla vita spericolata 
Fanculo alla ferrari e pure al maggiolino non valgono il sacrificio
 neanche di un moscerino spiaccicato sopra al vetro di un sabato 
Da pazzi niente giudizi però per quei ragazzi sono figli di questo 

Tempo che ha poco tempo per le morali sono ragazzi, ragazzi ""normali"" 
Figli di questo tempo un po' malato nei contenuti che questo rap sia 
Un monumento ai caduti di una guerra che fa vittime di diciotto anni
Sacrificate al dio dei grandi inganni comunque tutto questo non fa 
Parte del mio lavoro tutto questo va molto oltre ogni stupido coro di
Questi moralizzatori che san sempre ciò che è giusto che in fondo al 
Lunedì mattina ci provan gusto tutto questo con gli orari di chiusura 
Dei locali con la birra e con gli amari c'entra poco lo dico perché ho 
Sempre fatto tardi e chi ha in mano la risposta sono dei bugiardi io 
Non ho risposta alcuna ho soltanto la mia rabbia nel vedere molta gente 
Come me dentro una gabbia nel vedere che la libertà diventa paradosso 
E la trovi la mattina spiaccicata dentro a un fosso",Si Va Via

Jovanotti,"Viaggiare partire viaggiare viaggiare partire 
Viaggiare partire viaggiare partire partire 
Viaggiare viaggiare partire partire 
Viaggiare non fermarsi mai chilometri 
Che sotto il culo passano e allontanano i guai 
Viaggiare, vedere tutti gli angoli della terra 
Rincorrere le estati 
Farsi rincorrere dalla guerra che hai nel cuore 
Correre più veloce del dolore 
Come un jet supersonico precedere il tuo stesso rumore 
E fare in modo che non ti raggiunga mai 
Viaggiare al volante di una macchina scassata 
Che per ogni chilometro in più è un gloria 
Al padre e fare una telefonata a tua madre
Dire è tutto a posto ritorno per Natale
Ad ogni costo partire viaggiare agosto dopo agosto
Ancora un po' le responsabilità 
Come in una crepa in una barca che prima o poi ti allagherà 
E sarà forse troppo tardi per rimediare 
Partire viaggiare non dimenticare fotografare 
Il mondo in movimento che si ripeterà 
Ma chissà dove chissà 
Quando partire e vivere cercando e ballando ritmiche diverse 
E su diversi accenti 
Ballare sopra i fusi orari 
E sopra i mutamenti di clima 
Scalare la cima e poi scendere a valle 
Una dieci cento mille miglia 
Coi piedi per bagaglio 
E il mondo per famiglia 
Mangiare le cucine dei paesi più lontani 
Con le forchette, con i bastoncini, con le mani 
I paesi più lontani
Ma lontani da che lontani 
Da cosa lontani 
Da dove 
Con le radici nel tuo cuore 
E i rami nell'altrove 
Partire col sole sempre in faccia 
Ad ogni costo agosto dopo agosto
Viaggiare 
Sentirsi Marco Polo 
Sentirsi molto solo 
Qualche volta sopra un treno 
Dentro uno scompartimento 
Pieno di facce che non sai 
Che non saprai 
Confini di solitudini 
Che non cadranno mai
Che tu non rivedrai mai scambiare 
Quattro chiacchiere in lingue che non sai 
Comunicare con un semplice sorriso 
O con un gesto solo 
Scoprirsi Marco Polo 
E non sentirsi solo tra gli umani 
Stringere milioni di mani 
In ogni posto agosto dopo agosto
Viaggiare attraverso il suono, buono
Il basso che è un tuono 
Viaggiare attraverso la musica 
Attraverso la cultura 
La scoperta della natura e di sé
Viaggiare nei perché 
Viaggiare in Internet o sopra un jet o in bicicletta o a piedi 
E muoversi rimanendo fermi sul posto agosto dopo agosto",Marco Polo
Jovanotti,"Hai 18 anni e quell'aria da signora ti sta anche male
E non ci credere quando ti dicono che sei speciale
I complimenti costano poco e certe volte non valgono di più
Quello che sei, dove vai ciò che vuoi
Lo sai soltanto tu
E non ti mettere tutto quel trucco che ti sta male
A me mi piaci perché sei dolce quando sei normale
Quando rinunci ai comportamenti da fotomodella
E mi riempi la faccia di baci e mi accarezzi la pelle
Quando mi dici dai spegni la luce che mi vergogno
Quando sei lì che ti trema la voce e a me mi sembra un sogno
Ti vedo scritta su tutti i muri
Ogni canzone mi parla di te
E questa notte questa città mi sembra bellissima
Ti vedo scritta su tutti i muri
Ogni canzone mi parla di te
E questa notte questa città mi sembra bellissima
Chissà se stai dormendo
Sei maggiorenne oggi eh
E che cosa è cambiato
Che puoi firmare le giustificazioni
Quando avrai ""bigiato""
Ma nella scuola quella senza i libri
Non ti serve a niente
Perché da oggi devi stare attenta a tutta questa gente
Che ti riempie la testa di cose, di facce e di miti
Che non potrai veramente sapere a cosa sono serviti
Quindi bambina non credere a niente
Che non sia amore
Quindi bambina non credere a niente
Che non sia amore
Ti vedo scritta su tutti i muri
Ogni canzone mi parla di te
E questa notte questa città mi sembra bellissima
Ti vedo scritta su tutti i muri
Ogni canzone mi parla di te
E questa notte questa città mi sembra bellissima
Chissà se stai dormendo
A cosa stai pensando
Chissà se stai dormendo
A cosa stai pensando
Da quando abbiamo fatto l'amore ci penso spesso
A quanto è bello quando il sentimento si sposa col sesso
Sarà stato il destino
A volte penso vorrei lo sai essere stato il primo
E poi ci penso e alla fine è lo stesso perché
Perché tanto non l'hai mai fatto come l'hai fatto con me
Ti vedo scritta su tutti i muri
Ogni canzone mi parla di te
E questa notte questa città mi sembra bellissima
Ti vedo scritta su tutti i muri
Ogni canzone mi parla di te

Jovanotti,"La notte pi bello, si vive meglio
Per chi fino alle 5 non conosce sbadiglio
E la citt riprende fiato e sembra che dorma
E il buio la trasforma e le cambia forma
E tutto pi tranquillo tutto vicino
E non esiste traffico e non see' casino
Almeno quello brutto, quello che stressa
La gente della notte sempre la stessa
Ci si conosce tutti come in un paese
Sempre le stesse facce mese dopo mese
E il giorno cambia leggi e cambia governi
E passano le estati e passano gli inverni
La gente della notte sopravvive sempre
Nascosta nei locali confusa tra le ombre
La gente della notte fa lavori strani
Certi nascono oggi e finiscono domani
Baristi, spacciatori, puttane e giornalai
Poliziotti, travestiti gente in cerca di guai
Padroni di locali, spogliarelliste, camionisti
Metronotte, ladri e giornalisti
Fornai e pasticceri, fotomodelle
Di notte le ragazze sembrano tutte belle
E a volte becchi una, in discoteca
La rivedi la mattina e ti sembra una strega
La notte fa il suo gioco e serve anche a quello
A far sembrare tutto, tutto un po' pi bello

Parlare in una macchina davanti a un portone
Ed alle quattro e mezzo fare colazione
Con I cornetti caldi e il caffelatte
E quando sorge il sole dire buonanotte
E leggere il giornale prima di tutti
Sapere in anteprima tutti I fatti belli e brutti
Di notte le parole scorrono pi lente
Per molto pi facile parlare con la gente
Conoscere le storie, ognuna originale
Sapere che nel mondo nessuno normale
Ognuno avr qualcosa che ti potr insegnare
Gente molto diversa di ogni colore
A me piace la notte gli voglio bene
Che vedo tante albe e pochissime mattine
La notte mi ha adottato e mi ha dato un lavoro
Che mi piace",Gente Della Notte

C'è qualcuno che va alla messa
È si fa anche la comunione
È poi se vede un marocchino per strada
Vorrebbe dargliele con un bastone

Ma a questo punto hanno trovato
Un muro un muro duro molto molto duro

C'è qualcuno che fa di tutto
Per render la vita impossibile
C'è qualcuno che fa di tutto
Per renderti questo mondo invivibile

È c'è qualcuno che in una pillola
Cerca quello che non riesce a trovare
Allora pensa di poter comprare
Ciò che la vita gli può regalare

Io no, io no, io no, io no
Ci sono bimbi che non han futuro
Perché magari qualcuno ha deciso
Ci sono bimbi che non nasceranno
È se ne vanno dritti in paradiso

Perché da noi non c'è posto per loro
O solamente non erano attesi
Ci sono bimbi che non nasceranno
Perché gli uomini si sono arresi

C'è qualcuno che fa di tutto
Per renderti la vita impossibile
C'è qualcuno che fa di tutto
Per render questo mondo invivibile

A questo punto hanno trovato un muro

Jovanotti,"Tempo,
Tempo comunque vadano le cose lui passa 
E se ne frega se qualcuno è in ritardo 
Puoi chiamarlo bastardo 
Ma tanto è già andato 
E fino adesso niente lo ha mai fermato 
E tutt'al più forse lo hai misurato 
Con i tuoi orologi di ogni marca e modello


Ma tanto il tempo resta sempre lui quello 
L'unica cosa che ci è data di fare 
È avere il tempo da poter organizzare 
Si da organizzare 
Da dividere in passi 
Cassa rullante la mia voce 
Ed i bassi bassi medi e alti 
Per fare salti per far ballare il pubblico sugli spalti 
E non m'annoio e no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio 
Io no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio no che non m'annoio 
No che non m'annoio 

Tempo 109 battute al minuto 
Quando finisce forse ti sarà piaciuto 
La chiave per capire questo genere di suono 
Che a molte orecchie può sembrare frastuono 
E liberare la tua parte migliore chiudere 
Gli occhi aprire bene il cuore 
Che non c'è musica che vale di più 
Di quella musica che vuoi sentire tu 
E non mi stanco 
E no che non mi stanco non mi stanco 
Io no che non mi stanco 
Non mi stanco no che non mi stanco 
No che non mi stanco 

Sono passate 1000 generazioni 
Dai rockabilli punk e capelloni 
I metallari i paninari e sorcini 
E ogni volta gli stessi casini 
Perché i ragazzi non si fanno vedere 
Sono sfuggenti come le pantere 
E quando li cattura una definizione 
Il mondo è pronto a una nuova generazione 
E non m'annoio e no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio 
Io no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio no che non m'annoio 
No che non m'annoio 

Tempo 
Prezioso 
Conosco un modo per rimanere a galla 
Non abboccare a questa grande balla 
Del tempo che ti fa cambiare che ti modella
E più vai avanti più la vita è meno bella 
Sfuggi dal gruppo e pensa con la tua testa 
E stare insieme sarà sempre una festa 
Se riuscirai a sopravvivere lontano dal branco 
Non c'è noia non sarai mai stanco 
Sfuggi dal gruppo e non lasciarti fregare 
E non m'annoio io continuo a ballare 
E non mi rompo 
No che non mi rompo non mi rompo 
Io no che non mi rompo 
Non mi rompo no che non mi rompo 
No che non mi rompo

Tempo quando stai bene lui va via come un lampo 
Quando ti annoi un attimo sembra eterno 
Il paradiso può diventare inferno tempo
Ti frego con il ritmo ti cattura 
E ti chiudo in una ritmica di aspetto molto duro 
E ti organizzo in battute in quattro quarti 
All'ora non avrai tempo di liberarti
E con le gambe muovo anche il cervello 
E allora il tempo sarà mio fratello 
E come lui mi darà sempre una mano 
Mi darà tempo per andare lontano 
E come Ulisse cercherò di ritrovare 
Quella mia isola ma tanto viaggiare 
Sarà piacevole sarà indispensabile 
Anche se l'isola sarà irraggiungibile (ahaaaaa) 
E non m'annoio e no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio 
Io no che non m'annoio 
Non m'annoio no che non m'annoio 
No che non m'annoio 
E non mi stanco 
E no che non mi stanco non mi stanco 
Io no che non mi stanco 
Non mi stanco no che non mi stanco 
No che non mi stanco 
E non mi rompo 
No che non mi rompo non mi rompo 
Io no che non mi rompo 
Non mi rompo no che non mi rompo 
No che non mi rompo

Jovanotti,"Vorrei che tu avessi un nuovo ragazzo 
Vorrei che ti trattasse bene 
Che ti facesse sentire importante 
E che ti bolle il sangue nelle vene 
Quando ti aspetterà sotto il portone 
Per fare un giro, magari a cena 
Mi piacerebbe che tu toccassi il cielo 
Quando di notte ti bacia la schiena 
Che ti parlasse dei suoi problemi 
E che non li tenesse tutti per sé come me 
Vorrei vedervi magari sposati 
E che lui stesse sempre con te 
Che non ti facesse incazzare mai 
Che non dimentichi I compleanni 
Che sia simpatico ai tuoi genitori 
E che li faccia diventare nonni 
Ma quando un giorno sarai lontana 
E vedrai il cielo quando si colora 
Pensami almeno per un momento 
Pensami almeno per mezz'ora 
Vorrei sapere come ti va, eh? 
Ora che non stiamo più insieme 
Che mi hanno detto che hai sofferto un po' 
Che però ora stai bene 
Certo, all'inizio tutto era pazzesco 
Non smettevamo mai di stare a letto cacchio
Di combinarne di porcherie 
E guarda ora, chi l'avrebbe detto 
Esco di casa alle tre di notte 
Con quattro amici ce ne andiamo a caccia 
Per rimediare un amore facile 
Che il giorno dopo non ricordo la faccia 
Ma quando un giorno sarai lontana 
E vedrai il cielo quando si colora 
Pensami almeno per un momento 
Pensami almeno per mezz'ora
E quando son qui dentro il mio letto vuoto 
Vorrei dormire e non è facile 
Quando non sai se sia possibile 
Innamorarsi e non lasciarsi mai 
Poi quando un giorno sarai lontana 
E vedrai il cielo quando si colora 
Pensami per un momento 
Pensami almeno per mezz'ora 
Ma quando un giorno sarai lontana 
E vedrai il cielo quando si colora 
Pensami almeno per un momento 
Pensami almeno per mezz'ora.

Jovanotti,"E te lo dico in faccia ciò che penso di te
Quello che penso di chi pensa solamente per sé
E pensa che col grano puoi comprare la gente
Cambiargli il pensiero ed annullare la mente
La mia generazione forse è senza ideali
Magari senza palle con gli istinti animali
Cresciuti a sentire i discorsi dei padri
Barricati dietro muri in questo mondo di ladri
E hanno come idoli denaro e padroni
E valutano l'uomo in base a ""quanti milioni""
Milioni di cazzate, miliardi di miliardi
E noi saremo scemi ma non siamo bugiardi
E te lo dico in faccia, non c'è problema
Perché sotto i miei piedi il pavimento trema
E non è un terremoto, non è un'epidemia
Neanche una bufera neanche una carestia


È una tribù che balla ohoh
È una tribù che balla oheo
È una tribù che balla oho
È una tribù che balla oheo

È una tribù che balla e cerca una ragione
Perché ci sia una terra e ci sia una nazione
Formata dai ragazzi e dalla gente
Di credo, di colore e di cultura differente
Perché è l'unica strada ed è l'unica certezza
Perché nei nostri cuori finisca l'amarezza

È una tribù che balla ohoh
È una tribù che balla oheo

È una tribù che balla ohoh
È una tribù che balla oheo

È una tribù che balla al ritmo di un tamburo
Che picchia nella mente a chi si sente sicuro
Rinchiuso in un castello fatto di pregiudizi
Confuso nel discernere la virtù dai vizi
La musica è uno sparo, impedisce di parlare
Ti obbliga a pensare a quello che dovrai dire
Nel momento in cui sul piatto finirà questa canzone
Sarai un uomo pronto per la rivoluzione
Senza nessuna bomba, ma con tanto rumore
La musica finisce, ma rimane l'amore

È una tribù che balla ohoh
È una tribù che balla oheo
È una tribù che balla oho
È una tribù che balla oheo

È una tribù che balla e la pace sia con voi
La carica ti scarica più forte che puoi
È l'energia del sole per quanto ce ne resta
Che muove le tue gambe e accende la tua testa
Riempi la riserva e vai a manetta
E quando il tuo sudore bagnerà la tua maglietta
Ricordati che tu sei unico al mondo
E non esiste primo e non esiste secondo
Esiste una tribù, esistono i fratelli
Che più sono diversi e più sono fratelli
Ognuno ha la sua storia e le sue tradizioni
Ognuno il suo colore e le sue religioni
Ma il battito del cuore è lo stesso per tutti
La musica, la musica fa muovere tutti
Ma il battito del cuore è per tutti lo stesso
La musica, la musica e il resto nel cesso

Jovanotti,"Proprio come un albero che vive in mezzo agli alberi 
Mi sento quando giro per il mondo cerco di far si che 
Il vento non mi butti giù e di affondar le mie radici 
Nel profondo, prendo il sole in faccia per far si che 
Le mie foglie stiano bene appiccicate lungo questi rami 
Ospito tra le mie braccia nidi di uccellini e do rifugio
Nel mio fusto a molti sciami

Proprio come un albero mi spoglio e mi rivesto a seconda 
Se c'è freddo o c'è calore dentro la genetica la mappa 
Delle cellule descrive a quale genere appartengo se sono 
Una quercia oppure un salice piangente oppure un baobab od 
Un saggio di pianura quello che è importante è che al mondo 
Ci sia spazio per qualsiasi espressione di natura
Prendo il sole in faccia bevo molta pioggia io non ho 

Problemi a convivere con gli altri sono pronto ad accettare 
La mia sorte sono consapevole del fatto che più o meno presto 
O tardi ci sarà per me la morte quella che totò ha definito 
La livella e che alla fine ci livella tutti uguali alberi 
Bestiole re profeti presidenti calciatori poveretti ed animali
Quello che io penso come albero parlante è che la vita sia 
Questione di radici più sono profonde più ti puoi portar lontano 

Incontrando gente conquistando amici perché io ho scoperto che 
Le mie radici in fondo sono lì per procurarmi le risorse 
Cosicché con le mie foglie io possa affrontare venti forti e 
Possa farmi delle corse prendo il sole in faccia bevo molta pioggia 
Andare di qua e di là sconfinare allegramente farmi un pò ogni tipo 
Di esperienza incontrare gente allargare le vedute e allenare pure 
Un po' l'intelligenza senza mai scordare cosa sono da dove vengo 

E pure dove voglio andare con le mie radici belle salde nel terreno 
Io coi rami io mi posso allontanare perché c'ho bisogno della terra 
Sotto I piedi dove dare fondamenta alla speranza proprio come un 
Albero mi adatto un poco a tutto basta solo un po' di clima di 
Accoglienza no no no alla violenza non rivendico nessuna appartenenza 
Tranne quella al mondo degli esseri viventi col diritto di affondare 
Le radici sogno un universo dove ogni differenza sia la base per poter 

Essere amici prendo il sole in faccia bevo molta pioggia proprio 
Come un albero mi colloco nel mezzo tra la terra e il cielo proprio
A metà via opero una sintesi tra luce e clorofilla equilibrio di 
Sostanza ed energia",L 'Albero

E quando il pane sforno
Lo tengo caldo per te

Calda di scirocco e fresca come tramontana

Che diventano invisibili schiacciate dagli eventi dai grandi avvenimenti 
Una canzone piccola che parli di caffettiere di cartoline di pasta e ceci 
Di sveglie che non suonano o suonan troppo forte 
Di un ritornello che ti resta in testa di uno spiffero dalla finestra 
Delle tue labbra della tua maglietta una canzone lenta come una bicicletta 
Una canzone piccola fatta di due strumenti al massimo due accordi 
Senza tanti accorgimenti lontana dall'europa dal mondo e dalle stelle 

Ma molto molto molto molto molto vicina alla mia pelle 
Piccola come l'aria che mi entra nei polmoni una canzone piccola 
Con piccole emozioni fatta di una matita un poco di caffè 
Le scale mie di casa un piccolo perché I tuoi vestiti allegri 
A fiori di campagna senza pretese come una farfalla 
Che è bella perché è bella e non c'è discussione 
Una canzone piccola come la mia opinione 
Come un panino caldo come una passeggiata 

Talmente piccolina che adesso è già finita 
Come una chiacchierata col solito vecchio amico 
Che sa che cosa penso anche se non lo dico 
Una canzone piccola che parli delle cose in questa stanza 
Un movimento semplice una leggera danza 
Una canzone piccola che ci si può fidare 
Una canzone piccola che non ha niente da dimostrare 
Che non ha niente da dimostrare",Canzone Piccola
Jovanotti,"Il fiore del 2000 nascerà da un'ape che già vola sulla città
E zzzz zzzz zzzz la sento ronzare in cerca di un profumo che la faccia innamorare
In cerca di un fiore da baciare e di un vento da impollinare
Il fiore del 2000 non tarderà a darsi da fare
È tutto già presente il suo potenziale
È chiusa in una nuvola l'acqua che lo dovrà innaffiare
È ancora dentro un atomo la luce che lo dovrà colorare
E a me non resta che stare qua per vederlo sbocciare
Pregando sole e nuvole di darsi da fare
Perché c'è una ragazza che io glielo voglio regalare
Danza non ti fermare
La guerra del 2000 scoppierà da armi che son cariche in giro per la città

Le sento sparare difficile riuscire a starne fuori fan molto rumore
La guerra del 2000 non tarderà a farsi dichiarare
È tutto già presente il suo potenziale
Nell'odio tra chi ha troppo e chi ha niente
Negli interessi di certa gente
Nella follia nazionalista di qualche presidente
È nato già il ragazzo che si arruolerà per farsi ammazzare
E a me non resta che stare qua cercando di amare

Per la prima volta nella vita mia mi trovo a saper 
Quello che lascio e a non saper immaginar quello che 
Trovo mi offrono un incarico di responsabilità portare 
Questa nave verso una rotta che nessuno sa è la mia età 
A mezz'aria in questa condizione di stabilità precaria
Ipnotizzato dalle pale di un ventilatore sul soffitto
Mi giro e mi rigiro sul mio letto mi muovo col passo 
Pesante in questa stanza umida di un porto che non 
Ricordo il nome il fondo del caffè confonde il dove 

E il come e per la prima volta so cos'è la nostalgia 
La commozione nel mio bagaglio panni sporchi di 
Navigazione per ogni strappo un porto per ogni porto 
In testa una canzone è dolce stare in mare quando son
Gli altri a far la direzione senza preoccupazione 
Soltanto fare ciò che c'è da fare e cullati dall'onda 
Notturna sognare la mamma il mare
Mi offrono un incarico di responsabilità mi hanno detto
Che una nave c'ha bisogno di un comandante mi hanno 
Detto che la paga è interessante e che il carico è segreto

Ed importante il pensiero della responsabilità si è fatto 
Grosso è come dover saltare al di là di un fosso che mi 
Divide dai tempi spensierati di un passato che è passato 
Saltare verso il tempo indefinito dell'essere adulto di 
Fronte a me la nebbia mi nasconde la risposta alla mia 
Paura cosa sarò dove mi condurrà la mia natura? la faccia
Di mio padre prende forma sullo specchio lui giovane io 
Vecchio le sue parole che rimbombano dentro al mio orecchio
""la vita non è facile ci vuole sacrificio un giorno te ne
Accorgerai e mi dirai se ho ragione"" arriva il giorno in 

Cui bisogna prendere una decisione e adesso è questo giorno 
Di monsone col vento che non ha una direzione guardando il 
Cielo un senso di oppressione ma è la mia età dove si sa come 
Si era e non si sa dove si va, cosa si sarà che responsabilità
Si hanno nei confronti degli esseri umani che ti vivono 
Accanto e attraverso questo vetro vedo il mondo come una 
Scacchiera dove ogni mossa che io faccio può cambiare la 
Partita intera ed ho paura di essere mangiato ed ho paura 
Pure di mangiare mi perdo nelle letture, I libri dello zen 

Ed il vangelo l'astrologia che mi racconta il cielo galleggio
Alla ricerca di un me stesso con il quale poter dialogare ma 
Questa linea d'ombra non me la fa incontrare. mi offrono un 
Incarico di responsabilità non so cos'è il coraggio se prendere
E mollare tutto se scegliere la fuga od affrontare questa realtà
Difficile da interpretare ma bella da esplorare provare a 
Immaginare cosa sarò quando avrò attraversato il mare portato
Questo carico importante a destinazione dove sarò al riparo 

Dal prossimo monsone mi offrono un incarico di responsabilità 
Domani andrò giù al porto e gli dirò che sono pronto a partire
Getterò I bagagli in mare studierò le carte e aspetterò di 
Sapere per dove si parte quando si parte e quando passerà il 
Monsone dirò levate l'ancora diritta avanti tutta questa è la
Rotta questa è la direzione questa è la decisione",La Linea d'Ombra

Mi piace guardarti la schiena
Mentre sei girata verso il mare
In questa nottata serena
Va e dille che sto bene
Di non pensare a me
Di lasciar perdere
Il vento soffia e il tempo passerà
Palazzi e strade come scenografie
 
Di uno spettacolo
Che è andato male
Coi ballerini che tolgono il trucco
Per ritornare a cominciare a sognare
Luna di città d'agosto
Raccontami un' altra bugia
Fammi riscaldare davanti
Al fuoco caldo della malinconia
Va e dille che sto bene
Di non pensare a me
Di lasciar perdere
Il vento soffia
E il tempo passerà",Luna di Città d'Agosto
Jovanotti,"La gente si muove
La musica cresce
E ancora un altro muro viene giy!
Muratore muratore
Costruisce muri il muratore
Muri da dipingere e da colorare
Muri da fare crollare da fare crollare
Babylon Jerico, Porta Pia il Colosseo
Il muro di Berlino Machu Picchu
Le torri gemelle
Le piramidi d'Egitto
Il muro di cinta il muro del pianto
Le case popolari di ferro e cemento
Mura che delimitano il territorio
Mura che sorreggono torri d'avorio
Mura di parole
Mura di potere mura da fare crollare
Mura per proteggere e per dividere
Fragili da fare ridere
Butta la palla di l'!
Non see'h muro che mi tenga
Non see'h buio che mi spenga
Muratore muratore
Costruisce muri il muratore
Armato di cemento armato costruisce un
Nuovo muro
Con I pezzi di quello crollato da poco
Il muratore va e non si fermer'
A creare nuovi muri di disparit'
E mura la natura
E mura la cultura
E mura tutto cir che fa paura
Ma il pensiero non lo puoi murare
Perchh il pensiero h duro h cielo puro
E sta di qua e di l' dal muro
La gente si muove
La musica cresce
E ancora un altro muro viene giy!
",Il Muratore
Jovanotti,"Il nemico si nasconde si mimetizza tra le pieghe della coscienza 
La sua violenza è subdola il suo passo di gatto 
Difficile davvero coglierlo sul fatto 
Il nemico è tra noi è dentro di noi 
Per farlo fuori occorre rinunciare ad una parte di noi stessi 
Se un tempo era più facile lottare contro ciò che non andava 
Perché il nemico una faccia ce l'aveva 
Una voce, una bandiera 
Sapevi dove andare a prenderlo in giro la sera 
Aveva nomi e facce, ma non è più 
Così adesso non si vede ma lui è ancora lì più forte che mai 
E sotto sotto spinge col suo dai e dai 

E ha stipulato un patto con le coscienze addormentate 
Nella pubblicità di una realtà falsificata 
A migliaia di chilometri di distanza da questa 
Stanza uomini e bambini schiavizzati, sottopagati 
Diritti rubati derubati dell'infanzia in qualche capannone dell'estremo oriente 
Lavorano e producono le griffes dell'occidente 
E qui non si sa niente perché sta bene a tanti 
Tacere verità che sono atroci e allucinanti 
Pilastri di un'economia vincente dal volto appariscente 
Che crea la sua ricchezza con la sofferenza di un sacco di gente 
E quanti dovranno soffrire quante mucche impazzire 
Quanta aria velenosa bisognerà respirare 
Quanti cibi avvelenati bisognerà divorare 

Quante malattie ancora per interesse non si potranno curare 
Prima che qualcuno pensi che così non va bene 
Ma il nemico si è infiltrato dentro al sangue che ci scorre nelle vene 
Nei sorrisi compiacenti di politiche fatte di parole 
All'insegna di ""occhio non vede cure non duole"" 
Il nemico ha il volto sorridente cravatta e doppio petto 
Intorno a grandi tavoli fa incetta di rispetto e di sorrisi 
Strette di mano accordi tra potenti che non guardano lontano 
E approvano la produzione di mine anti uomo 
Di tutti gli armamenti necessari perché questo sistema 
Si mantenga bello saldo sui binari di sangue dove viaggia 
Cosicché anche il coraggio più coraggio si scoraggia 

Di fronte a questo gioco dove tutti hanno ragione 
E I peggiori criminali sono tenuti in alta considerazione 
E viaggiano in corsia preferenziale 
Rimbalzano sull'ammortizzatore sociale e non si fanno mai male 
E cambiano I governi ed il nemico gli sorride in silenzio 
Protetto dalla logica del tacito consenso di chi gode 
Di questa situazione che fa comodo a tanti 
Tenere alto il livello di paura e le coscienze ignoranti 
Paura della povertà paura dell'ignoto 
Paura di trovarsi di fronte al grande vuoto di se stessi 
Con la coscienza critica in stato di assoluta catalessi 
Sconfiggere il nemico è guardarsi dentro 

Cercare il proprio centro e dargli vita 
Come a un fuoco quasi spento 
Renderlo vivo dargli movimento 
Il nemico si nasconde spesso in quello che crediamo 
Nei moralismi ipocriti 
E nelle trasgressioni controllate e organizzate 
Nelle droghe illegali e sottobanco ben distribuite 
Il nemico crea falsi nemici per farsi scudo e apparir perbene 
Modellerà il suo aspetto e prenderà la forma di ciò che lo contiene 
Spacciandosi per libertà ti legherà con le sue catene 
Conservare il controllo di ciò che vediamo 
Conservare il controllo di ciò che sentiamo 
Verificare se sotto l'aspetto invitante di un'esca non sia nascosto un amo
Sconfiggere il nemico è guardarsi dentro 
Cercare il proprio centro e dargli vita come a un fuoco quasi spento renderlo vivo 
E dargli movimento",Occhio Non Vede Cuore Non Duole
Jovanotti,"E' un'alba così
Bella che sembra il primo giorno del mondo davanti a questa luce
Che illumina anche il buio più profondo non so parlare e non so
Niente di quello che see'è intorno a me ma niente mi impaurisce e
Tutto sembra naturale l'odore di quest'aria che riempie I miei
Polmoni e li accarezza il cielo che raccoglie I miei pensieri e
Mi da sicurezza è un giorno così nuovo che sembra che non abbia
Mai sofferto non riesco a immaginare che un tempo questa terra fu
Un deserto raccolgo con le mani manciate di acqua fresca
Trasparente e poi mi guardo intorno e son tranquillo di vivere
Così semplicemente la pace",La Pace
Jovanotti,"Se rimaniamo insieme 
Potremo anche volare 
Potremo attraversare questo mare 
Se rimaniamo insieme nelle diversità 
Insieme scopriremo la nostra unicità 
Se noi si resta insieme saremo la continuità 
Se rimaniamo insieme sarà vera libertà 
Per la vita che verrà 
Per la vita che verrà 
Tu non sarai mai sola 
Se rimaniamo insieme 
Se ci diciamo tutto 
Se insieme seminiamo 
Insieme coglieremo il frutto 
Se noi si resta insieme sarà una meraviglia 
Se rimaniamo insieme saremo una famiglia 
Per la vita che verrà 
Per la vita che verrà 
Tu non sarai mai sola 
Sotto questo cielo 
Io non sarò mai solo
Sotto questo cielo 
Noi rimarremo insieme se noi ci capiremo 
Se ci perdoneremo gli sbagli che faremo 
Noi rimarremo insieme se avremo volontà 
Se riusciremo insieme a darci libertà 
Per la vita che verrà 
Per la vita che verrà 
Tu non sarai mai sola 
Sotto questo cielo, 
Io non sarò mai solo, 
Sotto questo cielo 
Per la vita che verrà (2v) 
Tu non sarai mai sola, MAI !

Jovanotti,"O signore dell'universo
Ascolta questo figlio disperso
Che ha perso il filo e non sa dov'è
E che non sa neanche più parlare con te
Ho un cristo che pende sopra il mio cuscino
E un buddha sereno sopra il comodino
Conosco a memoria il cantico delle creature
Grandissimo rispetto per le mille sure
Del corano see'ho pure un talismano

Che me l'ha regalato un mio fratello africano
E io lo so che tu da qualche parte ti riveli
Che non sei solamente chiuso dietro ai cieli
E nelle rappresentazioni umane di te
A volte io ti vedo in tutto quello che see'è
E giro per il mondo tra I miei alti e bassi
E come pollicino lascio indietro dei sassi sui miei passi
Per non dimenticare la strada che ho percorso fino ad arrivare qua

E ora dove si va adesso
Si riparte per un'altra città
Voglio andare a casa la casa dov'e'
La casa dove posso stare
Io voglio andare a casa la casa dov'e'
La casa dove posso stare con pace con te
O signore dei viaggiatori
Ascolta questo figlio immerso nei colori
Che crede che la luce sia sempre una sola

Che si distende sulle cose e le colora
Di rosso di blu di giallo di vita
Dalle tonalità di varietà infinita
Ascoltami proteggimi
Ed il cammino quando è buio illuminami
Sono qua in giro per la città
E provo con impegno a interpretare la realtà
Cercando il lato buono delle cose

Cercandoti in zone pericolose
Ai margini di ciò che è convenzione
Di ciò che è conformismo di ogni moralismo yeahhh
E il mondo mi somiglia nelle sue contraddizioni
Mi specchio nelle situazioni
E poi ti prego di rivelarti sempre in ciò che vedo
Io so che tu mi ascolti anche se a volte non ci credo
Voglio andare a casa la casa dov'e'
La casa dove posso stare
Io voglio andare a casa la casa dov'e'

La casa dove posso stare con pace con te
O signore della mattina che bussa sulle palpebre quando mi sveglio
Mi giro e mi rigiro sopra il mio giaciglio
E poi faccio entrare il mondo dentro me
E dentro al mondo entro fino a notte
Barriere confini paure serrature
Cancelli dogane e facce scure
Sono arrivato qua attraverso mille incroci

Di uomini di donne di occhi e di voci
Il gallo che canta e la città si sveglia
Ed un pensiero vola giù alla mia famiglia
E poi si allarga fino al mondo intero
E poi su vola alto fino al cielo
Il sole la luna e marte e giove
Saturno coi suoi anelli e poi le stelle nuove
E quelle anziane piene di memoria

Che con la loro luce hanno fatto la storia
Gloria a tutta l'energia che see'è nell'aria
Questa è la mia casa la casa dov'e'
La casa dove posso portar pace
Io voglio andare a casa la casa dov'e'
Questa è la mia casa la casa dov'e'
La casa dove posso stare in pace con te",Questa é la Mia Casa
Jovanotti,"Hey puoi veder la mia corona 
Guarda il colore rosso del mantello 
E questo trono ed il tappeto guarda io 
Sono il re e questo è il mio castello 
Il regno mio si estende all'infinito lungo 
Le valli I monti il cielo e il mare 
Io sono il re del tempo e della storia io 
Sono il re venitemi a guardare 
Perché sono innamorato e sono corrisposto 

Io sono il re io sono il re di questo posto 
Senza regno ne corona con una donna che mi vuole bene 
Io sono il re ma lo so solo io e lo sai solo tu amore mio 
Nessuno può veder la mia corona ma sono il re io sono il re in persona

Jovanotti,"Rotola sotto di me come una strada
Le mie suole sono sensazioni che si consumano
Muovendosi si consumano
Fino a toccare coi piedi la terra nuda
Col vapore che suda
Sentirne l'umidità la rotondità
E la ritmica sotto che scorre
Come l'arteria che porta l'ossigeno in giro
Il respiro

Convergono in un punto le prospettive di linee parallele
Di questo vento noi siamo vele
Di questa ritmica che viene da lontano come 
pioggia d'estate che porta la sabbia del sahara
Morbidezza di dune
Alternarsi di soli e di lune
Di caldo e di freddo
Di acqua e sale
Di quiete e di moto

Di essenza e di vuoto
Di rosso di verde all'incrocio del suono
Susseguirsi di lampo e di tuono
La ritmica va
È un piacere primordiale accessibile ai bimbi soltanto
La gioia del ritmo la gioia del canto
La scoperta di spazi nuovi attraverso le mani
E portarsi alla bocca gli oggetti
Camminare a gattoni per terra
Rotolarsi sull'erba

Riconoscere la propria madre dall'odore
Cercare calore calore calore
La ritmica ti libera 
Stroboscopica che sollecita il mio pensiero
E cambia le coordinate di spazio e tempo lo allinea al suono
Lo alleggerisce
La ritmica imitazione della natura
Dove tutto è ritmico e matematico e fisico ed esoterico
Cibo per l'anima il ritmo che rotola sotto I miei piedi
Carboidrati di bassi e di medi

La ritmica va
La ritmica ti libera 
Tra le mura di questa stanza
Passo il capo di buona speranza
L'oceano atlantico e l'oceano indiano
Per tornare vicino andare lontano
Telescopio che vede lontano le lune di giove la luce di orione
Dentro gli occhi delle persone

Le ritmiche piu' lontane legate da un filo 
di suono in un unico canto assoluto
Attraverso l'imbuto del tempo
La sabbia che scende
Clessidra che gira respira
La ritmica
È un'ellittica intorno al sole
Sopra al ritmo soffio parole sviluppo calore calore calore
La ritmica ti libera",La Ritmica
Jovanotti,"Picchia duro sul tamburo
Vai sicuro suono puro
Io mi curo col tamburo
E trasformo il mio futuro
In un treno da ballare
In un posto salutare
Picchia duro sul tamburo
Piano piano mi carburo

È così che rompo il muro
Col mio suono di siluro
Contro il mondo e il suo cianuro
Ed il tempo io catturo
Succo di frutto maturo
Salto su come un canguro
Sgommo come con l'enduro
Chiudo gli occhi e nello scuro
Io mi lascio andare

Con le mani sul tamburo
Sudo tutto il mio cloruro
Nella danza mi avventuro
La realtà io trasfiguro
Chiudo gli occhi per vedere
L'universo respirare
Picchia duro sul tamburo

Vai sicuro suono puro

Tutti I pori io mi sturo

Sia bello sia bello e leggero 
Che voli sul filo dei tuoi desideri 
Ti porti momenti profondi e I misteri 
Rimangano dolci misteri 
Che niente modifichi I fatti di ieri 
Ti auguro pace risate e fatica 
Trovare dei fiori nei campi d'ortica 
Ti auguro viaggi in paesi lontani 
Lavori da compiere con le tue mani 
E figli che crescono e poi vanno via 
Attratti dal volto della fantasia 
Buon anno fratello buon anno ai tuoi occhi 
Alle mani alle braccia ai polpacci ai ginocchi 
Buon anno ai tuoi piedi alla spina dorsale 
Alla pelle alle spalle al tuo grande ideale 
Buon anno fratello buon anno davvero

Che ti porti scompiglio e progetti sballati 
E frutta e panini ai tuoi sogni affamati 
Ti porti chilometri e guance arrossate 
Albe azzurre e tramonti di belle giornate 
E semafori verdi e prudenza e coraggio 
Ed un pesce d'aprile e una festa di maggio 
Buon anno alla tua luna buon anno al tuo sole 
Buon anno alle tue orecchie e alle mie parole 
Buon anno a tutto il sangue che ti scorre nelle vene 
E che quando batte a tempo dice andrà tutto bene 
Buon anno fratello e non fare cazzate 
Le pene van via così come son nate

Jovanotti,"Alzarsi la mattina salutare il sole
Come un vecchio amico che
Non rivedevi più chissà da quanto tempo ormai
Hey come stai
Che cosa hai fatto mentre io non c'ero
Ma dimmi se sei vero
O gran termosifone illuminante
Che illumini il cantante
E chi lo sente
Che scaldi questo ambiente
Che sei così potente

Che se un giorno non ci sei si ghiaccia pure l'equatore
I battiti del cuore il rosso di un bel fiore
Le cure del dottore il suono di un rumore
Che fa la cina sì la cina
È così grande che a farla tutta a piedi
Ti ci vuol più di vent'anni
Mia madre se contasse bene I panni
Che ha lavato probabilmente vestirebbe il mondo
Se guardo la pietà di michelangelo

Mi accorgo che ci sta una dimensione più 
profonda dello stare nel pianeta
E il tempo che si spreca non ritorna
La pizza che si inforna
Non può ritornare cruda
A meno che tu escluda
La linearità del tempo
E veda l'universo come un tondo
Dove la cima corrisponde al fondo

È odore di oceano atlantico quello che mi porto addosso
E quando piove mi fa male un osso
E sono suscettibile agli sbalzi di tensione
Ottanta centoventi la pressione
Delle arterie I cani hanno
La febbre tutto l'anno
Ma loro non lo sanno
E stanno bene in tibet il duemila c'è già stato

Uno da solo si può fare molto può fare la pipì può addormentarsi

Può fischiare può svegliarsi
Può prendere a sassate dei lampioni
Può rompersi I coglioni
A non finire
Può anche farsi a pezzi ed impazzire
Ma uno con qualcuno che lo ama e che lo 
stima e che lo guarda con passione
Può anche fare la rivoluzione
Mia madre
Lo sai che il mare canta quando è sera una canzone che fa squash
E splah e sbarabash
E cambia ogni volta melodia

E il ritmo è quello della vita mia
Quando mi fermo ad ascoltarlo e danzo
E danzo e poi non penso
E sono di acqua e sale pure io
Allora guardo dio
Sopra di me
Contando fino a tre
Faccio un respiro e giro su me stesso come

Un sufi che danza simulando l'universo
Il moto dei pianeti e delle stelle
Son fuori e dentro dalla mia pelle

Andare andare aspettare dolcemente l'ora di mangiare 
Guardare l'erba crescere e l'acqua evaporare 
Tranquillamente all'ombra di una fresca brezza farsi accarezzare 
Dare forma tonda a bolle di pensieri 
Che scoppiano nell'aria non appena si fan troppo seri 
O troppo pesi starsene leggeri 
Trasformare le ore in mesi 
Come foglia lungo il fiume dentro la corrente dolcemente arresi

Con il braccio fuori dal finestrino farsi trasportare 
Dalla riga bianca in mezzo al nero delle strade 
Stare come un fiore nella pioggia di quello che accade 
Sentir gli odori la merda 
Dei porcili confondersi con il profumo d'erba 
Di infiniti aprili e starsene così come non sta chi c'ha da fare 
Con il volante tra le mani e il ritmo che ti fa dondolare 
Niente male dondolare 
Sentirsi come sale silenziosi dentro un grande mare

Sotto forma di un suono da un forte calore
Senza capo ne coda proprio come era lui
Come un fascio di luce negli angoli bui

Una specie di sacra antichissima danza
Il ricordo di lui gli riemp l'atmosfera
Fu in quel momento che seppe
Davvero chi era
Si sentiva beat-o
Per essere nato
Quel suono era suo l'aveva ritrovato
Sono qua si va potremmo andare avanti 'cause per una settimana
Senza cambiare accordo ne tempo come un film senza trama

Un eterno finale
Che non si sa se finisce bene o se finisce male
E nell'attesa restare a mezz'aria beati
Come appena nati
Come meravigliati
Come maghi e come innamorati come innamorati
Sono qua si va funky beat che cazzo ci vuoi fare

Non questione di buono o cattivo
Questione di essere vivo
Di essere adesso di scoprire il presente
Di non farsi manipolare da ci che pensa o che dice la gente
Di essere ora di essere e basta

Jovanotti,"Mi sono svegliato e ho visto le mie mani in fondo alle mie
Braccia
I piedi miei dalla parte opposta della faccia
Ho visto che per camminare devo mettere una gamba avanti e
L'altra indietro
E anche se mi sforzo posso volare in alto circa un metro
Per un secondo, e poi una strana forza mi riporta appiccicato al
Mondo la chiamano gravità
Mi sono svegliato ed ho capito che che non c'è libertà
E non c'è libertà che non c'è libertà e non c'è libertà
Mi sono svegliato ed ho creduto di essermi svegliato
E invece poi mi sono accorto di essere ancora addormentato
I miei pensieri, le mie parole, I gesti il mio rapporto con la
Realtà
Soltanto meccanicità niente volontà
Il frutto inconsapevole di una catena di eventi precedenti
A me al mio presente

Mi son svegliato ed ho creduto di essere cosciente
E invece niente imprigionato si meccanismi chimici nella mia
Mente
Sbattuto di qua sbattuto di là
Come una palla dentro al flipper dell'eternità
Mi sono svegliato ed ho capito che che non c'è libertà
E non c'è libertà che non c'è libertà e non c'è libertà
Mi sono svegliato e ho visto sofferenza intorno a me
E poi mi sono tagliato col rasoio mentre mi radevo
E tutta la sofferenza intorno a me è sparita
Ero da solo con la mia ferita
Soffrivo solo io mi sono accorto che dal mio stato fisico e
Mentale
Dipende anche il mio rapporto con la realtà
Mi sono svegliato ed ho pensato che, ho pensato che
Che non c'è libertà e non c'è libertà
Che non c'è libertà e non c'è libertà",Non C'E' Liberta
Jovanotti,"Per evitare guai
Muoversi in fretta non farsi mai
Fotografare fissi
Ma sempre un poco mossi saltare fossi
Sì saltare fossi saltare fossi
Sì saltare fossi
A volte ti può capitare a volte ti può capitare
A volte ti può a volte ti può capitare di pensare
C'è poco da fare c'è il cartello strada senza 
uscita e non si può continuare
L'asfalto diventa campagna

La campagna diventa montagna
La montagna è piena di insidie
La città è piena di invidie

Ma sempre un poco mossi saltare fossi
Sì saltare fossi
La deriva dei continenti
Ci presenta I suoi inconvenienti
Ogni piccola evoluzione
È una fase della creazione
Non è ancora finita non è ancora finita
Non è ancora finita ce n'è ancora una cifra

Onore al lampo e alla scintilla
Grande rispetto alla clorofilla
Gloria al fotone e all'elettrone
Viva l'idrogeno e il carbonio
La fibra ottica e il silicio
Viva l'istinto del sacrificio
Non è ancora finita ce n'è ancora una cifra
La foresta pluviale ricopre il sentiero che avevi tracciato

Alle spalle ti volti e non vedi più niente
Altre facce altre tracce
Altra gente proseguire a colpi di machete
Senza avere né fame né sete
Senza avere né fame né sete
Senza avere né fame né sete

Jovanotti,"Che lingua parli tu
Se dico vita dimmi cosa intendi
E come vivi tu
Se dico forza attacchi o ti difendi
T'ho detto amore e tu m'hai messo in gabbia
M'hai scritto sempre ma era scritto sulla sabbia
T'ho detto eccomi e volevi cambiarmi
T'ho detto basta e m'hai detto non lasciarmi
Abbiamo fatto l'amore e mi hai detto mi dispiace

Mi hai lanciato una scarpa col tacco e poi abbiamo fatto pace
Abbiam rifatto l'amore e ti è piaciuto un sacco
E dopo un po' mi hai lanciato la solita scarpa col tacco
Gridandomi di andare e di non tornare più
Io ho fatto finta di uscire e tu hai acceso la tv
E mentre un comico faceva ridere io ti ho sentito che piangevi
Allora son tornato ma tanto già lo sapevi
Che tornavo da te senza niente da dire senza tante parole

Ma con in mano un raggio di sole
Per te che sei lunatica
Niente teorie con te soltanto pratica
Praticamente amore
Ti porto in dono un raggio di sole per te
Un raggio di sole per te
Che cosa pensi tu
Se dico amore dimmi cosa intendi

Siamo andati al mare e mi parlavi di montagna
Abbiamo preso una casa in città e sogni la campagna
Con gli uccellini le anatre e le oche
I delfini I conigli le api I papaveri e le foche
E ogni tanto ti perdo o mi perdo nei miei guai
Ho lo zaino già pronto all'ingresso ma poi tanto tu già lo sai
Che ritorno da te",Un Raggio Di Sole
Jovanotti,"Un giorno ho visto un uomo che saliva le scale
gli ho chiesto scusi dove vuole andare
lei mi ha detto ha detto,
vado a prendere una nuvola
la porto dove non piove mai
mi scusi come fa a trasportare una nuvola
mi ha detto,
la respiro per un po'
e poi vado nel posto vogliono acqua

il resto va da sè non lo so...
un giorno ho visto un bambino che correva per strada
gli ho chiesto scusa dove corri bambino
mi ha detto sto inseguendo la mia ombra
così come tu segui il destino
e se la prendo poi me la tengo
la metto in un cassetto chiuso a chiave
così finalmente sarò grande abbastanza
sarò un capitano sopra una nave
il vento guiderà i miei comandi
e l'universo passerà dall'oblò
come aranciata dentro l'imbuto
il resto va da se non lo so...
mi piace bere un bicchiere d'acqua
la mattina al mio risveglio
mi sembre che mi fa sentire meglio meglio...
un giorno ho visto una che lavava il denaro
gli ho chiesto scusa cosa stai facendo
mi ha detto lo pulisco così vale di più
lo compro poi lo lavo e lo vendo
ma scusa cento lire sono sempre le stesse,
pulite o sporche valgono uguale
lei mi ha guardato un poco stupita
e poi ha continuato a lavare
la sera ho aperto il salvadanaio
e di monete io ne avevo un bel po'
e in bagno ho cominciato a lavare
il resto va da sè non lo so...
un giorno ho visto uno che leggeva al contrario
gli ho chiesto scusa che cosa stai facendo
mi ha detto ho letto libri per tutta la vita
e adesso io li sto cancellando
li rileggo tutti quanti al contrario
dimenticando quello che so
e poi mi terrò ciò che mi resta

Jovanotti,"Penso a te prima di dormire
Guardando il sole 
Che fa spazio all'imbrunire
In questa terra 
Lontana da casa
Lontana da te 
Che sei la mia casa
Ovunque tu sia 
Tu sei l'anima mia
Sei un campo di malinconia
Quando non sono da te 
Sei un campo di frutti dolcissimi
Quando sei qui con me 
Contadino del cuore
La mia gioia mi costa sudore
Io ti amo e fuggo lontano 
La misura di quanto ti amo 
È il pianeta
Di ogni viaggio lontano 
Da te sei la meta

Io re magio, tu stella cometa
Io re magio, tu stella cometa
 
Mi devo allontanare da te 
Per vederti tutta intera
Devo far finta che non ci sei 
Per scoprire che sei vera
Questa sera la signora dell'albergo 
Ha cucinato le patate
Come le fai tu 
Arrosto
Un po' croccanti fuori 
E morbide nel cuore
Proprio come le fai te
Proprio come te 
Proprio come te

Mangiandole mangiavo te 
Come una comunione 
E son scappato via perché 
Da troppo amore 
Non so respirare 
Amore amore amore amore
Questa parola vista da lontano 
Mi fa sentire un pellegrino 
Un penitente
Un cavaliere errante 
Un mezzo deficiente

Io ti amo e fuggo lontano 
La misura di quanto ti amo 
È il pianeta
Di ogni viaggio lontano da te 
Sei la meta
Io re magio, tu stella cometa
Io re magio, tu stella cometa
Io re magio, tu stella cometa
Io re magio, tu stella cometa

Adesso la luce del sole 
É sparita
La foresta si popola
Di nuova vita

Jovanotti,"Tutto può succedere

Storie da non credere

Fai, tutto può succedere
Mai dire mai
Qui non sempre è facile
Mai dire 

Mai, di fisso già so, già sai, qua sto
Qua stai già da mo' strani viaggi 

Rimane qualche souvenir dalla mente 
O dai dintorni vanno via così strane storie 
Strani giorni episodi in parallelo 
Viste da qua panoramiche tra cielo 
Stress sulle città
Ai tavoli di un bar sulla noia dei paesi 
Giorni sospesi sui sorrisi e sopra I volti tesi
Il tempo non da resi ma lo sai è così che 
Va ricorda quello che verrà
Per un chico che si è perso uno ritornerà 
Per ogni stop uno start un disegno apparirà
Tessere che siano parti di un mosaico in orbita 
Dentro alle case dello zodiaco
Segnando questi anni lunghi istanti
Qui niente è per sempre ùn tranne 
I diamanti e quando il peggior giorno 
Sembra eterno so che 
Tornerà primavera dopo quest'inverno

Vai così se è così buona la prima ognuno 
In un film ma quando è rima deve andare in cima

Ambress'ambress' già da mo' un viaggio nel viaggio 
Divido con mio amigo fido dido
Quindi vada come vada sicuro è per la vita 
Sta partita da giocare fino a che è finita 

Ognuno segue la sua via nel destino
Ma è così che va
Immaginando il suo cammino
E quello che sarà
Nelle strade, nelle case
Notti d'estate
Finestre ancora illuminate cercando gli attimi nascosti 
In più qualsiasi cosa che non basti conti 
In sospeso con la sorte a volte storie 
Vanno storte a volte sono solo porte dietro porte
Ma tutto resta uguale tutto cambierà 
E un altro giorno per vedere che ci porterà
Tutto resta uguale tutto cambierà 
E un altro giorno per scoprire cosa resterà
Forse domani sarà meglio
Domani sarà peggio, na domani 
Sarà come oggi solo di passaggio
E se domani sarà meglio 
E se domani sarà peggio domani sarà solo di passaggio",Tutto Puo Succedere
Jovanotti,"La vita nell'era spaziale

E forse l'idrogeno liquido sostituir il petrolio
Ma chi glielo racconta poi alla shell
E compagnia bella che see' un motore nuovo che funziona con l'acqua della cannella
Posso sognare esattamente come ho sempre sognato

E posso registrare tutto se l'ho dimenticato
Posso pregare dio un dio a mia immagine e somiglianza

Un miliardo al metro quadro 
Trasferirci poi su Marte 
E ricominciar daccapo 
Nelle notti di settembre 
Guarderemmo fin quaggiù 
Con un po' di nostalgia 
Per quel bel pianeta blu 
Potremmo smetter di parlare 
Di cantare e di viaggiare 
Tutti chiusi dentro casa 
Nelle stanze chiuse a chiave 
Non litigheremmo mai 
Non ci ammaleremmo più 
Tranne che di nostalgia 
Per il bel pianeta blu 

Ci sono 30 modi per salvare il mondo 
Ma uno solo perchè il mondo salvi me 
Che io voglia star con te 
E tu voglia star con me 
Che io voglia star con te 
E tu voglia star con me 

Potremmo prendere le armi 
E sparare tutti I colpi 
Fino a che ne resta vivo uno solo 
Tutti gli altri sono morti 
Guarderebbe giorno e notte 
Registrata alla TV 
Con un po' di nostalgia 
La gente del pianeta blu 
Potremmo smettere da ora 
Di vendere e di comprare 
Tutti con un pasto al giorno 
E un vestito per tutti uguale 
Senza meriti ne colpe 
Senza vizi ne virtù 
Finiremmo per stare male 
Dentro al bel pianeta blu

Jovanotti,"Canto l'altissimo immenso amore 
Perchè l'amore è una cosa eccezionale 
Senza l'amore non c'è niente da fare 
Auguro a tutti di poterlo provare 
Come lo prova il fiore con il sole 
Come succede alla terra con il seme 
E pure agli atomi e a tutte le altre cose 
Perchè è l'amore che le tiene insieme 
Dio ci protegga e ci faccia stare bene 
Distribuisca oceani d'amore 

Alla su agente e a tutti gli animali 
Per tutti I giorni e a tutte le ore 
Amore in alto 
Amore in basso 
Peril lombrico che vive sotto al sasso 
Per la lucertola e per l'airone 
Viva l'amore viva la rivoluzione 
Viva l'amore unica rivoluzione 
Perchè l'amore è politica biologica 
Se ne frega della logica 
Cura ogni malattia 
È mistero e pazzia 

Perchè l'amore unisce lo spirito e la carne 
E più ne dai e più ti vien voglia di darne 
È un sentimento complicato 
Non è mai sprecato 
Amore in alto 
Amore in basso... 
Perchè è sia la causa che l'effetto 
Ti ripara più di un tetto 
Ti espone al cambiamento 
In amore ti sei barca lui è il vento 
Ti trasforma in ciò che sei 
Traccia dei percorsi suoi 
Irriconoscibili e misteriosi 

Che ci rende radiosi 
Stelle danzanti nella creazione 
Viva la rivoluzione 
Si difende con l'amore 
È la luce del colore 
È un equilibrio in movimento 
Vita al 100% 
Non evapora col sole 
Molto più delle parole 
Più potente delle armi 
L'unica droga con la quale voglio farmi 
È la musica del cielo 
Si nasconde dietro a un velo 
L'unico comandamento 

Vita al 100% 
È no strumento divino 
È uno spirito bambino 
Amore in alto amore in basso

Sono il pasticcere 
Giova a me jova a te jova a tutti quelli che 
Ci vogliono stare dentro 
Alla periferia di nessun centro 
Sono a metà strada nella selva oscura 
1 per la tecnica, 2 per la natura 
Cerco il mio virgilio 
Morto di overdose 

Cerco la beatrice ma oggi ha le sue cose 
Cica cica bum ho una cicatrice 
Sembra un tatuaggio sai che cosa dice 
Fin qui tutto bene quindi procediamo 
1 per il pesce, 2 per l'amo 
Sono il pescatore a mia volta pescato 
Sono il peccatore e sono il peccato 
Chi inventò il dubbio che gli spaccò il culo 
Si sta così bene quando si é al sicuro 
Faccia sotto al sole verità in tasca 
Come un pesce d'allevamento dentro una vasca 

Crescere é un problema disse il bonsai 
Il baobab rispose accontentati di quello che hai 
Chissà perché rispose il piccoletto

Io sono il cavallo io sono la biada 
Io sono nessuno tranne per qualcuno 
E traun pasto e l'altro, per protesta digiuno 

Onda dopo onda cambio il mio contorno 
Io sono la pizza io sono il forno 
Troppa pastasciutta mi può strangolare 
Troppa informazione mi fa sragionare 
Troppa libertà mi ha fatto inceppare 
Troppa verità mi ha fatto impazzire 
Io sono clark kent, sono superman 
Ho I superpoteri quanto parte la jam 
Il mondo é la mia casa il cielo é il mio tetto 
Ho perso le chiavi sto qui fuori e aspetto 
Guardo dentro al buco pezzi di nirvana 

Fuggo da un eterno finesettimana 
Uno per lo yoga due per la scintilla 
Tre per l'antibiotico quattro per la villa 
Giova a me jova a te giova a tutti quelli che 
Credo in un solo dio madre onnipotente 
Creatore di chi crede e di chi non é credente

Tre per il messaggio quattro per il mittente 
Niente più carezze disse il bagnasciuga 
Grattami la schiena disse la tartaruga 
Ho il mio cucchiaino io per travasare il mare 
Fin qui tutto bene posso continuare 

Ho una cicatrice sembra un tatuaggio 
Sai che cosa dice avanti coraggio jova a me jova a te 
Alla periferia del centro commerciale 
Alla periferia della periferia del mondo occidentale 
Alla periferia del genere musicale 
Alla periferia del circolo polare artico 
Alla periferia del mondo celtico dell'equatore 
Del meridiano zero alla periferia del planisfero 
Alla periferia delle autostrade delle foreste delle contrade 
Alla periferia della sinistra e della destra 
Alla periferia del davanzale della mia finestra 
Alla periferia degli stati delle nazioni 

Al centro delle sensazioni e delle emozioni 
Alla periferia del vento alla periferia dell'uomo del momento 
Alla periferia dell'intervento 
Alla periferia della contemplazione 
Al centro della sensazione dell'emozione 
Datemi un catalogo di tutto ciò che esiste 
Le cose viste e quelle non viste 
Il ritmo é politico convoglia I movimenti 
Pensieri di sostegno sennò digrigno I denti 
Io sono pinocchio mi si allunga il naso 
Sono come un'anatra nuoto dentro al caso 

E prego non perché dio esiste ma perché dio esista 
Se non vedi l'ora vai dall'oculista 
Il mondo sta cambiando in questo non é mai cambiato 
Guardami un secondo sono già invecchiato 
Plastica facciale assicurazione 
1 per il cuore 2 per la ragione

Fila di cammelli davanti alla cruna 
Tutti in paradiso chi bene chi male 
Solo certi ricchi in paradiso fiscale 
Cica cica bum ho una cicatrice 
Sembra un tatuaggio sai che cosa dice 

Il mondo é una domanda aspetta una risposta 
Ogni luogo é un divieto di sosta 
L'equibrio statico é un calcolo dinamico 
Eccoti un coltello cazzo non ha il manico 
Quindi stai attento che puoi farti male 
Ho una conoscenza dimmi quanto vale 
Sono un chacchierone santa inquisizione 
Giudicami eretico mettimi in prigione 
Martiri del rap vivi per miracolo 
Come un cavallo io salto l'ostacolo 
Fino a che l'ostacolo é più alto di me 

In questo caso incolperò te 
Seni in silicone maschere di fango 
Fa una grande ombra l'albero di mango 
Sono omologato son colonizzato 
Ma se ti avvicini puoi sentire il mio fiato 
Tutta roba vera pane e companatico 
Sono calamita zero elettrostatico 
C'era sergent pepper io stavo nascendo 
Un capolavoro sai che cosa intendo 
Un giorno nella rete io c'ho incontarto un pesce 
Subito mi ha detto tu sai come s'esce 
Gli ho risposto no forse lo sai tu 

E ci siamo messi a guardare la tv 
Chi conosce il mare lo sa rispettare 
Molti marinai non sanno nuotare 
Chi conosce il ritmo sa che il tempo vola 
Va più veloce di una bollicina nella coca cola 
Se io fossi eletto già nel primo mese 
Fonderei il ministero delle sorprese 
Tutte positive naturalmente 
É il tuo compleanno improvvisamente 
Son l'ambasciatore di un posto migliore 
Sono il diplomatico del rumore 
Ministro delle poste e comunciazioni 

Buono tra I cattivi cattivo tra I buoni 
Ho una cicatrice resta sempre aperta 
Come la legge di domanda e d'offerta 
Dici tutto bene non ti preoccupare 
Ma ti vedo strana e non so che fare 
1 per il letto due per il calore 
3 per la forchetta 4 per l'amore 
Sono fatte di lacrime l'entrata e l'uscita 
Sono innamorato questa si che é vita 
Sentirò sto pezzo nel 2039 
Settantatre anni sarò chissà dove 

Mi prenderò a schiaffi se non sarò vivo 
1 per chi ascolta 2 per chi scrivo 
Hai sentito un chack pronti tutti in scena 
Colazione e pranzo pomeriggio e cena 
Il senso della vita forse so qual'é 
Ora non ricordo ma io so che c'è 
Sta da qualche parte forse sotto a un sasso 
Anzi se lo trovi passalo qui in basso 
1 per il ritmo 2 per la parola 
3 per la strada 4 per la scuola 
5 per chi insegna 6 per chi impara 
7 per chi gioca 8 per chi bara 
Sono a metà strada nella selva oscura 

Uno per la tecnica due per la natura 
Date al diavolo un bimbo per cena 
La parola fiore non ha nessun odore 
La parola ritmo non ti fa ballare 
Vivere la vita fino ad ubriacarsi 
Essere presenti fino ad annullarsi 
La parola magica é sempre la stessa 
Sim sala bim cara principessa 
Sono un italiano buongiorno buonasera 
Giro per il mondo esporto primavera 
1 per l'inizio due per la fine 

4 per il vento che passa sul confine 
Stemmi di famiglia impronte digitali

Jovanotti,"Giorni liberi non ne ho 
Davvero 
Giorni che io posso stare anche un'ora senza te 
Il mio amore è una storia a tempo pieno 
24 ore 7 giorni 12 mensilità 
Posso stare in apnea due minuti 
Dopo tre secondi muoio se io non respiro te 
Posso digiunare un giorno o anche tre 
Ma non posso stare un'ora senza che io mangi te

Cha mi hai fatto non lo so 
So soltanto che se te ne vai io morirò 
Che è successo non lo so

So soltanto che se non ci sei 
Io morirò d'amore 

Sono mela e me ne sto sul ramo 
Ma se non mi cogli in tempo cado a terra e marcirò 
Sono spina e me ne sto sul muro 
Ma non servo a niente se tu non mi dai elettricità

Cha mi hai fatto non lo so 
So soltanto che se te ne vai io morirò 
Che è successo non lo so 
Cha mi hai fatto non lo so 
So soltanto che se non ci sei 
Io morirò d'amore

E quel filo è dipendente dall'amore tuo per me

Scoprirebbero che pesa esattamente come te

Jovanotti,"Chi sono io chi
Sei tu?

'Cause'è che ci fa essere così lontani
In cosa tutt'e due possiamo dirci umani
E se possiamo dirci umani che cosa ci divide
E cosa lega I nostri due destini indissolubilmente
Che la distanza è tanta ma anche niente improvvisamente
Chi sono?
Chi sono questi qui che vanno avanti per le strade
In testa grandi carichi in braccio bimbi piccoli
Ma così piccoli che sembrano infiniti
Gli sguardi ammutoliti di ormai troppi lamenti
Che ormai più non li senti
E sono coreografici elementi
Di questa modernità che sembra una follia
Talmente colletiva che non la vedi più
Chi sono queste madri senza più un goccio di latte dentro la TV?
Chi sono io?
Chi sei tu?
Siamo noi

In altre vite in altre latitudini
In altre compagnie in altre solitudini
Siamo sempre inesorabilmente noi
Uniti nell'abbraccio di una stella
Divisi dentro al muro di una cella
Chi sono?
Chi sono questi qui intorno a un tavolo che parlano
Con traduzioni simultanee di parole che non cambiano
Che un giorno si sorridno e l'altro si accoltellano
E firmano con quegli inchiostri che poi si cancellano
Promesse che poi non mantengono
E fuochi che si spengono
Chi sono questi uomini che arrivano da in culo all'universo
E pensano che aldilà del mare lì può essere diverso
E allora partono
Disperazione genera speranza

E si ritrovan dieci in una stanza
Tra quattro muri di intolleranza
Forse giustificabile nell'ottica di un popolo
Che popolo non è neanche per niente
Al massimo la puoi chiamare gente
Chi sono questa gente
Che un poco mi somiglia e un poco no
Un po' è la mia famiglia e un poco no
Un po' l'ammazzerei e un po' gli voglio bene
Il sangue è sempre rosso
Indipendentemente dalle vene
Siamo noi
In altre vite in altre latitudini
In altre compagnie in altre solitudini
Siamo sempre inesorabilmente noi
Uniti dall'abbraccio di una stella
Divisi dentro al muro di una cella",Noi
Jovanotti,"Io sono un uomo 
Non so se hai presente un uomo 
Quello creato il sesto giorno prima delle ferie 
Quello che in molti vorrebbero fatto in serie 
Quello che ormai si sa quasi tutto 
Genetica mente simile al maiale 
Quello agli altri uomini diverso ma uguale 
Quello che si riunisce con I parenti a natale 
Quello educato, inscatolato 
Da mille telecamere 24 ore al giorno controllato 
Quello con il suo angolo segreto 
Dove sfogare le sue frustrazioni 
Quello pieno di limiti e limitazioni 
Che si redime bruciando nel fuoco delle passioni 
Io sono un uomo 
Non so se hai presente un uomo 

Ma che bella sensazione mi dà 
Allentare la mia rigidità 
Essere un essere umano soltanto 
Nel riso nel pianto e negli sbagli miei 

Io sono un uomo 
Non so se hai presente un uomo 
Quello che istintivamente 
Teme per la sorte dei suoi cari 
Che si caccia sempre in brutti affari 

Sdraiato sull'erba guarda passare le nuvole 
E prova un senso di stupore di fronte al creato 
Di cui teoricamente lui è l'essere meglio riuscito 
Di cui teoricamente lui è l'essere più evoluto 

Io sono un uomo 
Quello creato maschio e femmina 
Ma che non sempre si riconosce in queste categorie 
Quello indagato dalle varie psicologie 
Che pende dalle labbra di filosofi, 
Scienziati, politici e preti 
Che ama la libertà ma si appassiona ai divieti 
Io sono un uomo 
Non so se hai presente un uomo 

Ma che bella sensazione mi dà 
Allentare la mia rigidità 
Essere un essere umano vivente 
Sotto un cielo potente che mi tira su 

Ho due gambe due braccia un cuore una faccia 
E un sacco di idee 
Ma non so più quale sono le mie 
Aiaiaiaiaiaiai 
Ullallallalla 
Ma mia vita è un mistero 
Scusi sa dov'è il bagno? 
Mi sono perso 
Scusi sa che ore sono 
Da che parte è il centro? 
C'è qualcuno che mi prende sul serio? 
Io sono un uomo non so se hai presente 
E non è tutto sai? 

Puoi trovarmi nel centro di Milano 
Dentro una caverna o sopra un aeroplano 
Ansiogeno misogino dentro a un lacrimogeno 
Oppure intento a scindere l'atomo di idrogeno 
In una fila di macchine davanti a una puttana 
O a casa di mia suocera nel fine settimana 
A sfogliare riviste di moda tra attrazione e rabbia 
A spalmarmi creme a fare castelli di sabbia 
In ginocchio di fronte a un amore finito 
Al sicuro nascosto dietro al mio dito 
Bello come il sole in una mattina di primavera 
Rimesso in discussione già quando arriva la sera 
Io sono un uomo 
Non so se hai presente un uomo 
Che ci faccio qui? 

Essere un essere umano di sangue 
Di spirito e carne e di fragilità 

Io sono un uomo 
Non so se hai presente un uomo 
E sono ogni fiore che ho annusato 
Ogni merda che ho pestato 
Ogni occhio che ho incrociato 
Ogni cibo che ho mangiato 
Ogni libro che ho interrotto 
Ogni giocattolo che ho rotto 
Ma anche di più 
Molto di più di questo 

Qualcuno sa come va a finire?",Un Omo
Jovanotti,"Nel primo mondo c'è la tecnologia 
Pret a porter democrazia 
Nel secondo mondo c'è un po' di delusione 
Che non accelera I processi di ricostruzione 
Nel terzo mondo c'è caldo e umidità 
Incertezza sui confini e molta povertà 
Nel quarto mondo ondate migratorie 
Lavoro nero e alcune sparatorie 
Il quinto mondo è il prossimo livello 
Soltanto informazioni che nutrono il cervello 
I cittadini sono sparsi nel pianeta 
E vagano senza una meta 

Nel primo mondo la storia c'ha un finale 
E tutti quanti aspettano il giudizio universale 
Nel secondo mondo la storia si è girata 
Come nella padella succede alla frittata 
Nel terzo mondo la storia non si scrive 
E giorno dopo giorno si sopravvive 
Nel quarto mondo sta tutto in una borsa 
Che puoi portarti appresso anche se sei di corsa 
Il quinto mondo è quello senza storia 
Che niente è più variabile della memoria 
I cittadini sono sparsi per il pianeta 
E vagano senza una meta 

Il quinto mondo è il prossimo livello 
Teniamoci strettissimi sorella fratello 
I cittadini sono sparsi per il pianeta 
E vagano senza una meta 
La casa brucia sarà per troppo sole 
La casa è in fiamme sarà per troppo amore 
I coinquilini sono sparsi nel pianeta 
E vagano senza una meta 
La casa è in fiamme chi non ha chiuso il gas 
La casa brucia qualcuno non ha il pass 
La casa brucia potrebbe esserci un crollo

Come un vecchio professore che ha perduto la memoria 
Come un pezzo di pane che il miracolo ha moltiplicato

Come un sogno che c'è stato che ci sta ci starà ancora 
Come il sole che lavora anche se la notte è buia 
Come voce dentro a un coro di alleluja alleluja 

Come un uomo che danza 
Come un fiore che si schiude 
Come terra come acqua 
Come queste mani nude 
Che si aggrappano a te 
Come a un salvagente 
Come un piccolom pensiero che attraversa la mia mente 
Come un sorriso che accarezza 
Come una temperatura 
Come il mare come un elettrone come la natura 
Come un capello di Marley 
Come lo scoppio di un motore 
Come un menino addormentato sotto la statua del Redentore 
La lotta di uno solo 
Come voce dentro a un coro che si alza e prende il volo 
E arriva alle nuvole e ripiove sulle teste 
Come fuoco di una candelina in un milione di feste 

Come un granello di sale dentro a un mare salato 

Come il risveglio di un topo 
Come il ruggito di un leone 
Come il ritmo popolare di una piccola canzone 
Che diventa grande 
Passando di mano in mano 
Come quello che è vicino 
Come quello che è lontano 

Come un granello di sale in un mare salato 

Come una goccia di pioggia dentro a un temporale 
Come un colpo di tamburo dentro a un carnevale 
Come uno spermatozoo che per istinto sale 
Come il bacio di una bocca nata per baciare 
Come una foglia di tè dentro a una medicina 
Come il viaggio in un bicchiere di una bollicina 
Come l'ombra del fumo come il calore del pane 
Come il silenzio di un pesce come la gioia di una cane","Salato, Pt. 2"
Jovanotti,"I bianchi, I neri, la religione
Il pessimismo della ragione

I corvi che gracchiano ""rivoluzione""
Però non see'è pietà e non see'è compassione 
Il sangue si coagula sul pavimento 
Si inceppa l'articolazione del movimento
La voce che balbetta la speranza che inciampa
La capra che crepa, la capra che campa

A prenderti la mano

Come il bianco e il nero
Come una bicicletta che va

E poi giù come a planar
Tra mille girasoli
Tra tutti quei colori
Verso una piccola abbazia
Dove ogni giorno che vivrò
Ti sposerò
Giorno dopo giorno ora dopo ora
Siamo diventati forti come una verità
Ricominciamo
Andiamo lontano come sconosciuti
Soli in una grande città
Ciao piacere come stai
Di che segno sei

Come ti chiami andiamo via
Lungo l`autostrada
Con lo zaino in autostop
Arrivare a capo nord
Tra tutti quei gabbiani

Chi vede bianco chi vede nero 
Chi resta in casa chi se ne va in strada 
Che cosa conta che cosa è vero? 
Mi han detto che per tenere alti I consumi 
È necessario far morire I fiumi 
Ho letto che le marche dei diamanti 
Han provocato guerre devastanti 
Che il succo d'ananas è insanguinato 
Ed il caffè ha un gusto assai salato 
Che c'è chi vive nella povertà 
Fabbricando simboli di povertà 
Che un brevetto di unamedicina 
Vale più della vita di una bambina 
Posso capire che così si salvaguarda il lavoro 
Vorrei vedere fosse figlia loro

Il commercio è uno strumento di libertà 
Ma nel rispetto dei diritti e della dignità 
Della diversità e dell'ambiente

Allora forza venite gente 

Noi dobbiamo convincerli che la vita vale 
Una vita soltanto più di una multinazionale 
Noi dobbiamo convincerli che la strada buona 
È il rispetto totale dei diritti di una persona

Coi risparmi delle persone 
Ci finanziano l'industria bellica

Cosa devo fare mammà 
Vi prego signori che state a sentire 
Voi che avete il denaro voi che avete il potere 
Voi che avete l'accesso che guidate il progresso 
Voi che state pensando ""chi cazzo è questo fesso?"" 
Che fabbricate e vendete prodotti scaduti 
Che I vostri figli li mandate nei migliori istituti 
Che inquinate le anime le strade le acque ed I prati 
E I vostri giardini sono tutti curati

Sulla gente 
Poi ti bacerò con tutto

Perchè tu c'hai bisogno di ridere di gusto 
E ti ringrazierò 
Quando usciremo presto 
Da un locale ""giusto"" 
Guarderò da giù 
Il grattacielo dei tuoi tacchi mozzafiato 
E ti domanderai 
Se anche stavolta sono io quello sbagliato 
E faremo l'amore 
Dentro ad un temporale 
Tra le luci del centro 
Tra le statue di sale

Fiore di maggio
Vorrei cambiare il mondo ma il coraggio
Non è che lo regalano a natale
Per ora quindi cambierò canale

Fiore di spiga
Se pensi sempre ad evitar la sfiga
Non metti più la testa fuori dall'uscio
Non siamo fatti per stare nel guscio

Fior di cartone
Ovunque guardo vedo depressione
Ma un modo per aiutare i sofferenti
È quello d'imparare ad essere contenti

Fiore di fuori
Ne ho conosciuti di tutti i colori
Di neri gialli rossi verdi e bianchi
Nessuno stava fermo con il funky

Fiore fiore fiore di stagione
Canto per te la mia più bella canzone
Fiore fiore fiore che appassisce
Cambia stagione ma la musica non finisce
No, non finisce, non finisce, no, non finisce, non finisce

Fior dei paraggi
Ho interpellato preti guru e saggi
Cercando il posto dove potermi fermare
Ma trovo gusto solamente a camminare, a camminare

Fiori di fosse
Vivo una vita così senza scosse
Che per dar l'impressione che ho vissuto
Mi son comprato un jeans bell'invecchiato

Fiore d'acacia
Vò in paradiso quando lei mi bacia
E quando c'ho la consapevolezza
Che l'unica certezza, è l'incertezza

Fior di natura
Da piccolo di Dio avevo paura
Adesso c’ho paura della gente
Che in nome Suo si crede onnipotente

Fiore d'arancia
Evviva Don Quischotte e Sancho Panza
Ci hanno insegnato che quello che vedi
Può diventar di tutto, se ci credi, se ci credi

Fiore di tuono
Concedimi di sapere io chi sono 
Così che dopo troverò il coraggio
Di interpretare meglio il personaggio

Fior di lavanda
Da sempre mi tortura una domanda
“Perché gli viene facile all'umano
amarsi, specialmente da lontano?”

Fiore fiore fiore di stagione
Canto per te la mia più bella canzone
Fiore fiore fiore che appassisce
Cambia stagione ma la musica non finisce
No, non finisce, non finisce… no, non finisce, non finisce

Fior di giardino
Fino a trent’anni non bevevo vino
Poi ho preso a interessarmi a tutto quello
Che più invecchia e più diventa buono e bello

Fior nella pioggia
Nessuno sa dove la terra appoggia
Cos'è che fa girare le stagioni
Com'è che a noi, ci girano i coglioni (ah ah ah ah)

Fiore di vischio
Le cose belle han sempre un po' di rischio
Le rapide, le cime, i barracuda
La donna innamorata mezza nuda

Fiore di rapa
Anche se me lo venisse a dire il Papa
Che è giusto rinunciare a ogni piacere
Nella rinuncia io vorrei godere!

Fiore fiore fiore di stagione
Canto per te la mia più bella canzone
Fiore fiore fiore che appassisce
Cambia stagione ma la musica non finisce
No, non finisce, non finisce… no, non finisce, non finisce

Fiore fecondo 
I genitori ti mettono al mondo
Ti nutrono sol succo e con la polpa
E con quintali di sensi di colpa

Fior di letame
C'è sempre da passare qualche esame
Non basta studio, intuito e intelligenza
È sempre il culo a far la differenza

Fiore di viola
La tua bellezza è oltre la parola
La tua giustizia è oltre la morale
La tua fintezza è oltre il carnevale

Fiore di sposa
Ormai si può comprar qualsiasi cosa
Ma quello che appassiona me e la gente
È pagar caro quel che non costa niente
(Dammene ancora)
(Dammene ancora)
(Dammene ancora)

Fiore d'erbacce
Io come un cane annuso mille tracce
E a un certo punto mi agito e poi scavo
Senza sapere neanche quello che cercavo

Fior d'allegria
Quaggiù da noi c’è la democrazia
Dove ogni cosa la puoi delegare
A me mi scappa e tu vai a cagare

Fior di giornale
I critici mi han scritto bene e male
Ma i giorni tristi a dirla veramente
Son stati quelli che non hanno scritto niente
(Come come come come come come?)

Fior di successo
Lo so che io mi contraddico spesso
Amico mio che cosa ci posso fare
Per me le idee son fatte per cambiare

Fiore fiore fiore di stagione
Canto per te la mia più bella canzone
Fiore fiore fiore che appassisce
Cambia stagione ma la musica non finisce
No, non finisce, non finisce, no, non finisce, non finisce

Fior d'ananasso
Tu sei la batteria io sono il basso
M’incastro dentro di te perfettamente
Sto nel ventre tuo ritmicamente",Antologia di Stornelli [*]
Jovanotti,"Ho una promessa di ali 
Scritta sulla mia schiena 
Qualcosa di me 
Un giorno volerà 
Sono la punta dell'iceberg 
L'anello di una catena 
Qualcosa di me 
Nel vento resterà 
Il meccanismo complesso delle ossa della mia mano 
È precedente alla mia volontà 
Gli atomi del mio cuore vengono da molto lontano 
Da molto prima della felicità 
Colori dentro al mio occhio 
E suoni dentro al mio orecchio 
Brrrivi reaggenti chimici 
Tento di fare amicizia 
Con quello dentro allo specchio 
Che dice scusami perchè mi imiti 
Sono un'incrocio di linee 
Sono l'altare del caso 
I miei pensieri si accendono con l'aria nel naso 
Se la mia vita è una gabbia allora sono un'evaso 
Io credo a tutto mi chiamo mica tommaso 
Trasformo zucchero in sogni e pesci in passi di danza 
Ed ho inventato il lavoro per poter fare vacanza 
E mi innamoro di tutto e non mi stanco mai 
Di provocare amore di provocare guai 

Gira il minestrone che sennò s'attacca 
Bagna questa pianta che sennò si secca 
Apri la finestra fai entrare il vento 
Uhhh è tutto quanto in movimento! 
Uhhh è tutto quanto in movimento! 
Uh uh uh! 

Io scrivo con un computer che non so come funziona 
La tecnica la matematica 
Ma è il bisogno di uscire da questo corpo persona 
È precedente alla cybernetica 
E posso unirmi a una donna e seminare il suo campo 
Ma non so fare la pioggia e non so fare il lampo 
Il mio destino proforma ed il mio corpo si forma nei secoli dei secoli 
Il ritmo di quattro quarti è quello più congeniale 
Perchè fa rima con il respiro del cuore 
Lo stretto di gibilterra è la mia zona ideale perchè fa rima 
Col mio bisogno di andare 
Verso il luogo sconosciuto 
Fatto non fui 
A viver come bruto 
Fatto non fui 
Il luogo sconosciuto 
Fatto non fui 
A viver come bruto! 

Gira il minestrone che sennò s'attacca 
Bagna questa pianta che sennò si secca 
Apri la finestra fai entrare il vento 
Uhhh è tutto quanto in movimento! 
Uhhh è tutto quanto in movimento! 
Uh uh uh! 

Sono il discjockey dei venti so fabbricare il sudore 
Ma non son buono a remixare l'amore 
E sono un giglio dei campi sono ubbriaco di brina 
E in ogni notte vado a cercare la mattina 
Con 20 segni io posso spiegare quello che provo 
Ma non so chi è nato prima la gallina o l'uovo 
Io sono un vecchio bambino compratemi un pallocino 
E un pò di dolce per fare lo stile nuovo 
Il ritmo di 4 quarti è quello 
Più congeniale perchè fa rima con il respiro del cuore 
Lo stretto di gibilterra è la mia zona ideale 
Perchè fa rima col mio bisogno di andare 
Verso il luogo sconosciuto

Jovanotti,"Ho visto scimmie arrampicare su ogni tipo di ramo 
Ho visto pesci abboccare ad ogni tipo di amo 
Ho visto donne dalla pelle d'oro e donne more vestite in cellophane 
Oppure solo con un fiore 
Ho visto un piede farsi avanti è l'altro che esitava 
In una mano un cellulare nell'altra la clava 
Ed o pensato ai miei pensieri con comodità 
Giustificando per pigrizia anche le atrocità 
E ho visto toccato ascoltato annusato 
In ogni torta che vedevo 
Ci ho affondato il dito 

E vedrò toccherò ascolterò annuserò 
E in ogni torta come sempre il dito affonderò 
Ho un buco nella tasca 
Ogni cosa che ci metto scompare 
Ho un buco nella tasca ricominciare 
Ho visto un essere umano preoccuparsi per me 
Senza chiedere in cambio niente di niente per sé 
E ho fatto scelte senza scegliere che scelta fare 
Convinto di trovare una montagna sotto al mare 
E ho visto le api fare il miele 
E gli uomini fare il male 
E ho visto l'arcobaleno prima di un temporale 

Ho visto il lampo di una lacrima alla fine del riso 
Ho visto un uomo camminare dopo che è stato ucciso 
Ho visto i fiori più meravigliosi e colorati quelli più rari 
Inaccessibili e più profumati 
Mi son trovato alle soglie di una notte scura 
Utilizzavo quel ricordo contro la paura 
E ho messo trappole in giro e ci son cascato io 
E ho visto auto in doppiafila nel parcheggio di dio 
E ho visto toccato ascoltato annusato 
In ogni torta che vedevo 
Ci ho affondato il dito 
E vedrò toccherò ascolterò annuserò 
E in ogni torta come sempre il dito affonderò 
Ho un buco nella tasca 
Ogni cosa che ci metto scompare 
Ho un buco nella tasca ricominciare 

E ho visto causa ad effetto che si scambiavano il ruolo 
E ho visto bravi orchestrali crollare dentro un assolo 
E ho visto facce diverse dentro lo stesso riflesso 
Ed ogni giorno è diverso anche se il sole è lo stesso 
E ho visto grandi orologi su gente di poco polso 
E sarei anch'io un assassino se non deviassi l'impulso 
Guarda quel fiore finto sembra vero. Ho detto 
Guarda quel fiore vero sembra finto, Ho detto 

E vedrò toccherò ascolterò annuserò 
E in ogni torta come sempre il dito affonderò

Al mercato al centro di New York ho comprato un kalashnikov in ottimo stato
L'ho scambiato al mercato di Rio con una chitarra ed uno stereo rubato
Dallo stereo sentivo canzoni e imparavo a suonarle cambiandole appena
Sono andato al mercato di Tokyo le suonavo dall'alba all'ora di cena
Coi guadagni ci ho preso una barca e da lì ho navigato fino in Inghilterra
Ho venduto la barca a un ragazzo che in cambio mi ha dato il suo pezzo di terra
C'ho piantato patate e carote che poi rivendevo al mercato vicino
E con i soldi prendevo lezioni di danza, di scienza, di yoga e di mimo

Mumbojumbo mumbojumbo mumbojumbo
Cosa ne sarà di me
Mumbojumbo mumbojumbo mumbojumbo

Da lì son ripartito per molti paesi davo lezioni di mimo e di danza
Di yoga di canto e di scienza e l'ho fatto fino a quando ne avevo abbastanza
Con il denaro raccolto insegnando ho comprato un cavallo al mercato di Jaffa
Mi ha guidato fin quasi a Kinshaza e da lì l'ho cambiato con una giraffa
Che ho portato al mercato di Istanbul destando nel popolo la curiosità
Seducevo le donne negli harem che la notte mi davano ospitalità
Poi da una io mi sono innamorato e da piombo che ero ho cavato dell'oro
Che ho venuto sul banco dei pegni in cambio del piombo e di un po' di denaro
Arrivato nei quartieri spagnoli ho comprato un quaderno già scritto a metà
C'era scritto ""prosegui il racconto fino a quando qualcuno lo proseguirà""

Arrivato giù a Tamarasset ho ottenuto un cammello da un nomade stanco
L'ho portato al mercato del Cairo e lì l'ho scambiato con un abito bianco
E così mascherato da ricco ho avuto l'accesso all'ambiente più illustre
E vendevo la mia consulenza ai politici, ai preti e ai padroni d'industrie
Col denaro ho comprato il consenso e con il consenso ho raccolto il denaro
C'ho comprato un paese, un esercito e un quintale di polvere da sparo
E c'ho fatto la guerra col mondo per vedere se la guerra c'ha qualcosa di buono
Poco prima di aver la risposta ho venduto l'esercito al consiglio dell'ONU
E con i soldi sono andato da Zeus e gli ho chiesto potere sul tempo e sul sogno
Mi ha risposto ""il potere puoi averlo ma i tuoi soldi vai a darli a quelli che ne han bisogno""
E così sono sceso in pianura e ho comprato una vacca al mercato di Dehli
Ci ho fondato una nuova religione e ho raccolto devoti, invasati e infedeli
Con le offerte ci ho preso un diamante che in ogni momento cambia riflesso
E ogni cosa che guardo lì dentro è sempre diversa ma è sempre lo stesso
E ogni volta che guardo lì dentro è sempre diversa

Jovanotti,"Un mio parente era il cuoco sulla nave di Ulisse
Al grande eroe e ai suoi uomini faceva pranzi e cene
Anche a lui fu dato l'ordine che non ascoltasse

Passando da quell'isola il canto delle sirene
Ma lui si addormentò e non si mise la cera
E quando si svegliò credette di avere sognato
Ma invece l'esperienza era stata vera
Quel canto misterioso lui l'aveva ascoltato
E misteriosamente anche dimenticato
Restò dentro di lui quel richiamo del vuoto
Che hanno tutti gli uomini che hanno vissuto
Un tuffo inconsapevole nell'assoluto
Da lui ho imparato a vivere la realtà come un sogno
E i sogni come fossero una cosa reale
A vivere ogni viaggio come fosse un ritorno
E che anche i grandi eroi han bisogno di mangiare

Oh, buon sangue non mente, la la la la la
Io son di tutta la gente diretto discendente

Tra i miei antenati più illustri c'è un tale Caino
Fondò la prima città e fu il primo assassino
Una domanda sanguinava il suo cuore e cervello
Perché quella mattina Dio preferì mio fratello?
Ma nei giorni più cupi, nei momenti più bui
Lui sentiva che invece il più amato era lui
E come segno di amore gli era stato concesso
Il dolore e la colpa per il male commesso

Oh, buon sangue non mente
Io son di tutta la gente diretto discendente

Un parente tra i più antichi era un manovale
Nel cantiere della grande Torre di Babele
Il progetto nell'insieme non lo conosceva
Ma mattone su mattone la Torre cresceva
Ad un certo punto con i soldi del salario
Pensò bene di comprarsi un vocabolario
Inglese, spagnolo, turco, arabo, giapponese
Swahili, italiano, greco, indo, russo, portoghese
Quel dizionario in qualche modo è nelle mie mani
Ma è sempre complicato capire gli umani
Una mia ava era una donna alta un metro e dieci
Frequentava romani, galli, egizi e greci
Il suo corpo era piccino, ma pieno di calore
Sottomise tutti quanti, anche un imperatore
Dalla mia ava ho imparato che non c'è potere
Che resista all'arte buona di dare piacere

Oh, buon sangue non mente
Io son di tutta la gente diretto discendente

Nel mio albero genealogico quasi alla radice
C'è una donna di Bretagna che faceva l'attrice
Ma siccome solo i maschi lo potevano fare
Recitava di essere un uomo per recitare
Cardinale, puttana, mendicante, musa
La platea di fronte a lei non era mai delusa
Da quella donna ho imparato che l'identità
Ha una maschera e la maschera dà libertà
Puoi cambiare faccia, parte, umore e sesso
Nel frattempo camminare di fianco a te stesso
Ricapitolando a caso tra i miei antenati
C'era uno che è vissuto al tempo dei crociati
Fabbricava poi vendeva cinture di castità
Era il garante tecnico della fedeltà
E quando i cavalieri andavano a imbarcarsi in nave
Non sapevano che lui aveva la doppia chiave
Mi ha insegnato che i costumi cambiano spesso
E che tra guerra e religione c'ha ragione il sesso

Oh, buon sangue non mente,
Io son di tutta la gente diretto discendente

Un mio antenato visse al tempo di Savonarola
Ascoltava i suoi anatemi parola per parola
Ammirava nei suoi occhi quella luce interiore
Che hanno gli uomini di fede, di forza, rigore
Poi però quando tornava a casa dopo i sermoni
Passava piazza della Signoria, via Tornabuoni
Le botteghe degli artisti, bordelli, mercati
Si sentiva a suo agio tra i condannati

Oh, buon sangue non mente
Io son di tutta la gente diretto discendente

Lo zio di un mio trisnonno suonava il violino
Il suo sogno era di essere un grande virtuoso
Poi si innamorò di una che gli cambiò il destino
Lasciò perdere il violino divenne triste e geloso
Dopo un sacco di anni che stavano insieme
Quando aveva rinunciato al suo sogno di artista
Lei se ne andò via con i profumi e le creme
E si mise con uno che faceva il violinista
Mi insegnò che rinunciare all'ambizione è sbagliato
Che poi la dea si vendica se c'hai rinunciato

C'era un matto che faceva sculture di vento
Si fermavano a guardarlo quando in movimento
Modellava ogni dettaglio della sua opera d'arte
Dopo un po' la fissava seduto in disparte
Quasi sempre scontento del suo risultato
Con un soffio distruggeva quel che aveva creato
E la gente a casa ritornava
Con scolpito negli occhi il matto che danzava
Mentre lui andava a letto sempre insoddisfatto
Proprio come un uomo, proprio come un matto

Oh, buon sangue non mente
Io son di tutta la gente diretto discendente

Tra i parenti più lontani c'è un bestemmiatore
Ce l'aveva con Dio che gli era debitore
Di favole raccontate prima di mettersi a letto
Di cui tutti i bambini del mondo hanno diritto
Lui era nato senza motivo apparente
Tranne quello di diventar delinquente
Fu per questo che a Dio volle fargli dispetto
E divenne un cittadino corretto
Un mio nonno combatteva le battaglie di Troia
Un altro faceva l'aiutante del boia
Ce n'era uno contadino, un'altra ballerina
Uno morì di vecchiaia, uno di ghiottina
Da tutti questi ho imparato la più grande lezione
Niente accade due volte e per questa ragione
Si nasce senza esperienza, si muore senza assuefazione",Good Blood [*]

Four o'clock rock 
Ordine e disciplina 
Dall'ovest alla Cina 
Five six seven o'clock 
Eight o'clock rock 
Tutto sotto controllo 
Dal tetto alla cantina 
Le banche garantiscono 
Le vergini arrossiscono 
E il culo sotto ai raggi 
Del sole si arrostiscono 
E ALice guarda I gatti 
E I gatti scappano dai cani 
All'uomo di Neanderthal 
Gli prudono le mani 
E il riff di satisfaction 
Ci soddisfa 

E il letto si rifà 
E sognando poi si disfa 
E tutto scorre senza 
Troppe sorprese 
Aumentano I ricavi 
Aumentano le spese 
Normali carezze 
Normali torture 
I soliti entusiasmi 
Le solite paure 
I bravi da una parte 
Dall'altra I recidivi 
I morti in paradiso 
E nell'inferno I vivi 
E più il mondo è moderno 
E più l'uomo diventa antico 
""presentato oggi a Milano 
Il nuovissimo modello 
Di foglia di fico"" 

Ma mi disordino 
Quando ti vedo sulla soglia 
Quando ti cade giù la foglia 
Quando mi lanci I tuoi coltelli 
Quando ti sciogli I tuoi capelli 
Quando mi accogli nel tuo sole 
Quando mi asciughi le parole 
Quando mi butti all'aria I piani 
Quando riscaldi le mie mani 
Quando intravedo la tua cima 
Quando io e te facciamo rima 
Quando non sai che io ti guardo 
Quando esponi il tuo stendardo 
Quando trasformi l'acqua in vino 
Quando mi mostri il tuo giardino 
Quando non so che cazzo dire 
Quando però lo devo dire 
Io mi disordino 

Diritto canonico diritto romano 
Diritto naturale diritto umano 
Left right balla ballerina 
Il sole tramonta la sera e sorge la mattina 
E il super doganiere controlla le frontiere 
Tra essere ed avere tra patire e piacere 
Mi hanno organizzato l'esistenza 
Da quando mamma era in gravidanza 
La pappa la scuola 
La cacca la suora 
Il mare il ruttino gli esami 
Il casino I desideri I bisogni 
La libertà I sogni 
Ed ogni estate un nuovo passo di danza 
E vivo come in una gravidanza infinita 
Come se fossi un feto per tutta la vita 
Come se fossi un feto per tutta la vita 

Ma mi disordino 
Quando mi mischi le tue carte 
Quando la macchina non parte 
Quando ti annuso I genitali 
Quando siam come due animali 
Quando c'é vento tra I miei rami 
Quando mi mandi I tuoi richiami 
Quando io scio sulla tua schiena 
Quando mi mangia la balena 
Quando mi mangia la balena 
Mi disordino 
Io mi disordino 

Confermato il rapporto tra I cateti e il quadrato 
Un gomito che picchia sullo spigolo fa un male cane 
Farina acqua e lievito scaldati danno il pane 
Il percorso più breve tra due punti è una retta 
L'ostacolo più inutile tra due punti è la fretta 
Gestisco il tempo come fosse un conto in banca 
Quanto ne è passato? 
Quanto ne manca? 

Ma mi disordino 
Quando scateni la tempesta 
Quando sei al centro della festa 
Quando scavalchi le mie mura 
Quando sorridi alla paura 
Quando sbatacchi la lattina 
Quando mi inverti la mattina 
Quando confondi le mie idee 
Quando sconvolgi le maree 
Quando mi scricchiola il mio trono 
Quando io surfo sul suono 
Quando mi complichi le cose 
Quando mi smascheri le cose 
Quando ti illumini di rabbia 
Quando spalanchi la mia gabbia 
Quando sproteggi il mio sistema 
Quando l'impianto trema 
Quando la porta resta aperta 
Quando l'esercito diserta 

Dimentico la chiave io vedo la mia trave 
Io allento il mio controllo ti bacio sul collo 
Mi dedichi attenzione 
Non cerco un'opinione 
Sospendo il mio giudizio 
Mi anticipi l'inizio 
Il ritmo cambia tiro 
Sconvolgi il panorama 
La storia cambia trama 
L'impianto trema 
Non so la trama io smollo I legamenti 
Col corpo io ti penso l'assurdo prende senso 
E ascolto le sirene 
C'é ritmo nelle vene

Al mercato al centro di New York ho comprato un kalashnikov in ottimo stato
L'ho scambiato al mercato di Rio con una chitarra ed uno stereo rubato
Dallo stereo sentivo canzoni e imparavo a suonarle cambiandole appena
Sono andato al mercato di Tokyo le suonavo dall'alba all'ora di cena
Coi guadagni ci ho preso una barca e da lì ho navigato fino in Inghilterra
Ho venduto la barca a un ragazzo che in cambio mi ha dato il suo pezzo di terra
C'ho piantato patate e carote che poi rivendevo al mercato vicino
E con i soldi prendevo lezioni di danza, di scienza, di yoga e di mimo

Da lì son ripartito per molti paesi davo lezioni di mimo e di danza
Di yoga di canto e di scienza e l'ho fatto fino a quando ne avevo abbastanza
Con il denaro raccolto insegnando ho comprato un cavallo al mercato di Jaffa
Mi ha guidato fin quasi a Kinshaza e da lì l'ho cambiato con una giraffa
Che ho portato al mercato di Istanbul destando nel popolo la curiosità
Seducevo le donne negli harem che la notte mi davano ospitalità
Poi da una io mi sono innamorato e da piombo che ero ho cavato dell'oro
Che ho venuto sul banco dei pegni in cambio del piombo e di un po' di denaro
Arrivato nei quartieri spagnoli ho comprato un quaderno già scritto a metà
C'era scritto ""prosegui il racconto fino a quando qualcuno lo proseguirà""

E così mascherato da ricco ho avuto l'accesso all'ambiente più illustre
E vendevo la mia consulenza ai politici, ai preti e ai padroni d'industrie
Col denaro ho comprato il consenso e con il consenso ho raccolto il denaro
C'ho comprato un paese, un esercito e un quintale di polvere da sparo
E c'ho fatto la guerra col mondo per vedere se la guerra c'ha qualcosa di buono
Poco prima di aver la risposta ho venduto l'esercito al consiglio dell'ONU
E con i soldi sono andato da Zeus e gli ho chiesto potere sul tempo e sul sogno
Mi ha risposto ""il potere puoi averlo
E così sono sceso in pianura e ho comprato una vacca al mercato di Dehli
Ci ho fondato una nuova religione e ho raccolto devoti, invasati e infedeli
Con le offerte ci ho preso un diamante che in ogni momento cambia riflesso

Dire una cosa proprio a te 
Che mi conosci bene come la tua pelle 
Questa mattina quando te sei uscita prima di me 
Sono rimasto a letto a guardar le stelle 
Disteso dalla parte tua 
Con il tuo calore ancora di terra 
Di sogni che non so comprendere 
Io trattenevo il respiro 
Per sentire il silenzio 
Di una stanza quando non ci sei 
Abbracciavo il cuscino 

Per cercare il profumo 
Di una notte dai capelli tuoi e non ci riuscirò mai Mai 
A dirti quanto bella sei sei 
Quanta vita mi dai dai 
E quello che tu sei per me per 
Me per meper me per me 
Sei l'altra parte della luna 
Il fuoco che non si consuma 
Il tuono che precede il lampo 
La cassaforte del mio tempo 
E' difficile poi 

Ritrovarsi tra noi 
Con addosso dieci anni insieme 
L'abitudine sai è il peggiore dei guai 
Si diventa come due vecchi comici 
Che non ridono più 
Che non inventano più 
Che sono li a rassicurare il pubblico 
Io ti amo e mi vergogno anche un po' 
Come un bambino io continuo a dirtelo 
E non ci riuscirò mai mai 
A dirti quanto bella sei sei 
Quanta vita mi dai dai 

E quello che tu sei per me per 
Me per meper me per me 
Fedele non sarò mai 
Ma non ti tradirò mai 
Sai che fedele io non sono a niente 
Io non lo sono con me 
Io non lo sono con te 
Neanche con dio nemmeno con la gente 
Non ti amerò come vuoi 
Perché non so dire noi 
Però lo sai che posso darti il sole 

È solo insieme a te 
Che io ho capito perché 
È così bella la parola amore 
E non ci riuscirò mai mai 
A dirti quanto bella sei sei 
Quanta vita mi dai dai 
E quello che tu sei per me per 
Me per meper me per me 
Tu sei la signora dell'olimpo 

La pioggia che ravviva il campo 
La madre che non mi somiglia

La notte dove addormentarmi 
E l'ala dove ripararmi

Jovanotti,"E le mie gambe han camminato tanto 
E la mia faccia ha preso tanto vento 
E coi miei occhi ho visto tanta vita 
E le mie orecchie tanta ne han sentita 
E le mie mani hanno applaudito il mondo 
Perchè il mondo è il posto dove ho visto te 
Dove ho visto te 
Dove ho visto te 
E le mie ossa han preso tante botte 
E ho vinto e perso dentro tante lotte 

Mi sono steso su mille lenzuola 
Cercando il fuoco dentro una parola 
E le mie mani hanno applaudito il mondo 
Perchè il mondo è il posto dove ho visto te 
Dove ho visto te 
Dove ho visto te 
E c'è una parte dell'America 
Che assomiglia a te 
Quei grandi cieli senza nuvole 
Con le farfalle e con le aquile 

E c'è una parte dentro all'Africa 
Che assomiglia a te 
Una leonessa con I suoi cuccioli 
Che lotta sola per difenderli 
E le mie braccia hanno afferrato armi 
E tanta stoffa addosso a riscaldarmi 
E nel mio petto c'è un motore acceso 
Fatto per dare più di quel che ha preso 
E le mie mani hanno applaudito il mondo 
Perchè il mondo è il posto dove ho visto te 

Dove ho visto te 
Dove ho visto te 
E le mie scarpe han camminato tanto 
E la mia faccia ha preso tanto vento 
E coi miei occhi ho visto tanta vita 
E le mie orecchie tanta ne han sentita 
E le mie mani hanno applaudito il mondo 
Perchè il mondo è il posto dove ho visto te 
Dove ho visto te 
Dove ho visto te 
E c'è una parte della mia città 

Che assomiglia a te 
Quella dei bar con fuori I tavolini 
E del silenzio di certi giardini 
E c'è una parte della luna 
Che assomiglia a te 
Quella dove si specchia il sole 
Che ispira musica e parole 
Baciami baciami baciami 
Mangiami mangiami mangiami 
Lasciami lasciami lasciami 
Prendimi prendimi prendimi 
Scusami scusami scusami 

Usami usami usami 
Credimi 
Salvami 
Sentimi 
E c'è una parte della vita mia 
Che assomiglia a te 
Quella che supera la logica 
Quella che aspetta un'onda anomala 
E c'è una parte in Amazzonia 
Che assomiglia a te

Jovanotti,"Sotto una palma al centro di Alexander Platz 
Ci siamo presi il nostro tempo per decidere 
Con la filosofia del grande Snaporaz 
Abbiamo scelto che non volevamo scendere 
Da questa giostra che ci fa girar la testa 
E che ci tiene in orbita 

Dentro a una giungla sopra a un tetto di Parigi 
Mentre ammiravo le tue ali di farfalla 
Abbiamo immaginato di essere felici 
Come due bimbi proprietari di una stella 

In una febbre tropicale al polo sud 
Sognai I miei vecchi sorridenti in riva al mare 
Mentre guardavano la mia barca andare via 
Benedicendo la mia rotta dentro al cuore 
Perchè ogni tempo porta dentro un dispiacere 
Perchè ogni giorno porta dentro un pò d'amore 
Che ci tiene in orbita 

Dentro un locale messicano di Shanghai 
Ho immaginato meno spreco di dolore 
Ho vista appesa al muro l'onda di Hokusai 
Mi ha ricordato che ogni cosa può cambiare 
Su questa giostra che ci fa girar la testa 
E che ci tiene in orbita",In Orbita
Jovanotti,"Sono sicuro che 
Se non ti conoscessi 
E tu arrivassi ora all'improvviso 
Mentre me ne sto qui a non fare niente 
Immerso nella strada 
Se non ti conoscessi 
Dicevamo 
E non avessi mai detto 
Ti amo 
Mai a nessuna donna prima d'ora 
Per Imbarazzo 
O perchè non c'era 
Se non ti conoscessi 
E a un certo punto 

Mentre distrattamente guardo avanti 
Così come si fa 
Sovrappensiero 
E tu passassi ora come sei 
Io per la prima volta nuovamente 
Mi sentirei così come mi sento 
Ancora un'altra volta nuovamente 
Starei proprio così 
Come sto adesso 
Innamorato 
Se tu apparissi ora 
Come sei 
Con quel tuo modo di guardare netto 

Coi tuoi capelli 
Che come un sipario 
Si aprono soltanto 
A chi ha il biglietto 
Io nuovamente ancora un'altra volta 
Mi sentirei così 
Come mi sento 
Incatenato nella tua atmosfera 
Imprigionato 
Come piuma al vento 
Io per la prima volta nuovamente 
Mi sentirei così come mi sento 
Ancora un'altra volta nuovamente 
Starei proprio così 
Come sto adesso

Quante domande mi affollano la testa 
In questi giorni di grande dolore 
Oggi è il primo giorno del tempo che ci resta 
Un giorno buono per incominciare 
Quante persone ci son passate già 
Da questo incrocio pieno di domande 
Milioni di milioni da qui all'eternità 
Ma la risposta non è mai abbastanza grande 
Per riempire il vuoto che ci manca 
Per riempire il cuore dell'umanità 
I got so many questions running up inside my mind 
Life is so long but it isn't still enough time 
To answer all the questions I got inside my mind 
Io vorrei spingermi un poco più aldilà 
Dove la musica è un fuoco che ci unisce 
E fa brillare tutta la realtà 
Dove la verità non appassisce

Balla questo ritmo che ti fa buon sangue 
Schiarisce le idee e poi ti scioglie le gambe 
Crea una connessione con le onde e le distanze 
Un solo ritmo sei milioni di altre danze 
Balla questo ritmo che ogni cosa si trasforma

Quello che non c'è ancora è già da qualche parte 
Quello che è passato ha influenza sulla sorte

Jovanotti,"Caselli d'autostrada tutto il tempo si consuma 
Ma Venere riappare sempre fresca dalla schiuma 
La foto della scuola non mi assomiglia più 
Ma I miei difetti sono tutti intatti 
E ogni cicatrice è un autografo di Dio 
Nessuno potrà vivere la mia vita al posto mio 
Per quanto mi identifichi nel battito di un altro 
Sarà sempre attraverso questo cuore 
E giorno dopo giorno passeranno le stagioni 
Ma resterà qualcosa in questa strada 

Non mi è concesso più di delegarti I miei casini 
Mi butto dentro vada come vada 
Siamo come il sole a mezzogiorno baby 
Senza più nessuna ombra intorno baby 
Un bacio e poi un bacio e poi un bacio e poi altri cento 
Teoricamente il mondo è più leggero di una piuma 
Nessun filo spinato potrà rallentare il vento 
Non tutto quel che brucia si consuma 
E sogno dopo sogno sono sveglio finalmente 
Per fare I conti con le tue promesse 
Un giorno passa in fretta e non c'è tempo di pensare 
Muoviamoci che poi diventa sera

Siamo come il sole a mezzogiorno baby 
Senza più nessuna ombra intorno...baby 
Gente che viene 
Gente che va 
Gente che torna 
Gente che sta 
Il sole se la ride in mezzo al cielo 
A guardare noi che ci facciamo il culo 
E' un gioco 
Mezzogiorno di fuoco 
E' un lampo 
Sulle armature 
In guardia 
Niente da capire

In una goccia di sudore

Jovanotti,"La notte ha mille porte 
E nella testa c'è una città intera 
Che soffia e che respira 
Che soffre e che ti attira 
Sempre più dentro 
Sempre più al centro 
Sempre più in mezzo fino a che non lo distingui più il confine 
Tra la tua pelle e il cielo 
Tra quello che è a pezzi è quello che è intero 
La notte ha mille occhi 
Credi di guardare e sei guardato 
Sono tempi ""rock'n roll"" 
Che si resta senza fiato 
Cadono I record alle olimpiadi 
Tutto si supera in un secondo 
E in ogni mondo c'è dentro un mondo 
Che ha dentro un mondo che ha dentro un mondo 

Ci sono armi nei supermercati 
E mettono I ""beep"" nei vaffanculo 
Ci dicono continuamente che nessuno è al sicuro 
Ma questo lo sapevo già 
E non è mai stata una buona scusa 
Per barricarmi dentro casa 
La tele accessa e la porta chiusa 

Safari 
Dentro la mia testa 
Ci sono più bestie che nella foresta 

La terra vista dallo spazio è una palla 
Azzurra e silenziosa 
Ma se ci vivi ti rendi conto 
Che è tutta un'altra cosa 
Niente combacia ci sono crepe 
E dalle crepe passa un po' di luce 
Che si espande nell'universo 
Prendi tutto quello che ti piace 
Ho"" diamanti sotto ai miei piedi"" 
Ho un oceano dentro alle vene 
Ognuno danza col suo demone 
E ogni storia finisce bene 

Safari 
Dentro la mia testa 
Ci sono più bestie che nella foresta 

Fuoco 
Acqua 
Elettricità 

Le scimmie saltano di ramo in ramo 
Assaggio la notte, 
La notte che passa più svelta 
Su lente lenzuola di corpi 
Sudati si chiudono gli occhi 
Si spegne l'insegna dell'ultima vita di luce 
Rubate si finge il silenzio perfetto 
L'esterno ti sembra di pace 
La notte d'estate 
Intanto il ruomore 
Nel buio dell'anima mia 
Che corre a gambe levate 
Sbattendo con forza 
Su muri di pelle e di ossa 
Un paio di ali al vento 
Un paio di ali al vento al vento",Safari
Jovanotti,"Gli occhi non sanno vedere quello che il cuore vede 
La mente non può sapere quello che il cuore sa 
L'orecchio non può sentire quello che il cuore sente 
Le mani non sanno dare quello che il cuore da 
C'è un temporale in arrivo 
C'è un temporale in arrivo senti l'elettricità 
C'è un temporale in arriuvo sulla mia città 
Porta novità porta novità 
Il lupo perde il pelo io perdo le occasioni 
Ma non so perdere il vizio delle emozioni 

La vita è più interessante delle definizioni 
E tutto quello che arriva da qualche parte va 
Gerusalemme è divisa sotto ad un solo cielo 
E la mia mente è divisa dentro ad un corpo solo 
Un meridiano per forza incrocia un parallelo 
Determinando la sorte di molta umanità 
E tutto quello che sappiamo non è vero 
E tutto quello che sappiamo non è vero 
Si perdono le origini nel buco del tempo 
Ma tutto si conserva nelle profondità 

Sia l'elefante che il topo non avranno scampo 
La legge della savana li governerà 
Non si può scegliere un sogno non si può scegliere 
Quando ti arriva ti arriva non c'è niente da fare 
Le previsioni del tempo si posson prevedere 
Ma un temporale che arriva non lo puoi fermare 
Si danza per invocare la fertilità 
Si danza prima del sesso o di un combattimento 
Si danza per riscaldarsi dal freddo che fa 
Si danza per imitare il lavoro del vento 

Quando non so dove sono io mi sento a casa 
Quando non so con chi sono mi sento in compagnia 
Quando c'è troppa virtù il cuore mi si intasa 
La cura è spesso nascosta dentro alla malattia 
C'è un temporale in arrivo 
C'è un temporale in arrivo senti l'elettricità 
C'è un temporale in arrivo sulla mia città 
Porta novità porta novità 
Quando tu hai fame nessuno può mangiare per te 
Quando io ho sete nessuno può bere al posto mio 

Anche gli automi hanno un cuore di alluminio puro 
Pronto per farci passare l'amore del futuro 
Abramo lascia la casa senza sapere niente 
Si mette in strada lasciando quel che sapeva già 
E il trapezista si gioca tutto continuamente 
Per pochi soldi ed per un brivido di libertà 
L'autista di scuolabus ha in mano la nazione 
Più di un ministro di un Papa o di un'autorità 
E c'è una terra di mezzo tra il torto e la ragione 
La maggior parte del mondo la puoi trovare là 

Lavori in corso ci dispiace per l'inconveniente 
Hanno scoperto una casa dell'antichità 
Due scheletri abbracciati qualche osso poco o niente 
Ma il loro bacio va avanti per l'eternità 
C'è un temporale in arrivo 
C'è un temporale in arrivo senti l'elettricità 
C'è un temporale in arrivo sulla mia città 
Porta novità porta novità 
L'antico impero cinese accolse Marco Polo 
Perchè era un giovane mercante di immaginazione 

Non servono grandi ali per spiccare il volo 
La vita è molto più vasta di una definizione 
E stanno tutti aspettando che succeda qualcosa 
Che tolga il velo di polvere dalla realtà 
E stanno tutti aspettando che arrivi la sposa 
Coi fiori in mano e una promessa di felicità 
Problemi di digestione ispirano romanzi 
Rivelazioni che nascono nell'acidità 
Un pò di bicarbonato dopo certi pranzi 

Si eviterebbe lo scontro delle civiltà 
Gli uccelli volano bassi e sfiorano l'asfalto 
E I cani stanno in silenzio con aria d'attesa 
La foto sulla parete mi segue con lo sguardo 
Nessun allarme per ora nessuna sorpresa 
C'è un temporale in arrivo 
C'è un temporale in arrivo senti l'elettricità 
C'è un temporale in arrivo sulla mia città 
Porta novità porta novità 
E l'invincibile non è quello che vince sempre 

Ma quello che anche se perde non è vinto mai 
L'intelligenza è nel corpo il sapere nel cuore 
Se pensi sempre ad un muro un muro troverai 
Mi son trovato memorie che non sono mie 
Ho un solo nome ma almeno cento identità 
E' naturale preferire le belle bugie 
Alla durezza di ghiaccio di certe verità 

Viviamo comodi dentro alle nostre virgolette 
Ma il mondo è molto più grande più grande di così 
Se uno ha imparato a contare fino a sette 
Vuol mica dire che l'otto non possa esserci 
Senti l'elettricità senti l'elettricità 
C'è un temporale in arrivo 
Porta novità porta novità",Temporale
Jovanotti,"I tuoi grandissimi sogni i miei risvegli lontani
I nostri occhi che diventano mani
La tua pazienza di perla le mie teorie sull'amore
Fatte a pezzi da un profumo buono
Il tuo specchio appannato la mia brutta giornata
La mia parte di letto in questa parte di vita
Il tuo respiro che mi calma se ci appoggi il cuore
La nostra storia che non sa finire

So che è successo già
Che altri già si amarono
Non è una novità
Ma questo nostro amore è
Come musica
Che non potrà finire mai
Che non potrà finire mai
Mai mai

Le nostre false partenze i miei improvvisi stupori
Il tuo sex and the city i miei film con gli spari
I nostri segni di aria in questi anni di fuoco
Solo l'amore rimane e tutto il resto è un gioco
I tuoi silenzi che accarezzano le mie distrazioni
Ritrovarti quando ti abbandoni
Il nostro amore immenso che non puoi raccontare
E che da fuori sembrerà normale
So che è successo già
Che altri già si amarono
Non è una novità
Ma questo nostro amore è
Come musica
Che non potrà finire mai
Che non potrà finire mai
Che non potrà finire mai

Siamo stati sulla luna a mezzogiorno
Andata solo andata senza mai un ritorno
E abbiamo fatto piani per un nuovo mondo
Ci siamo attraversati fino nel profondo
Me c'è ancora qualcosa che non so di te
Al centro di tuo cuore che c'è
So che è successo già
Che altri già si amarono
Non è una novità
Ma questo nostro amore è
Come musica

Che non potrà finire mai
Che non potrà finire mai
Che non potrà finire mai
Che non potrà finire mai
Che non potrà finire mai
Che non potrà finire mai
Che non potrà finire mai
Che non potrà finire mai

Old school ministry funky testimony 
Latin jazzy DJ funky grandmaster 
Music ambassador of Italian (sound blaster) 
Generous like generous is the sound of my band 
United we play united we stand 
I speak english like a New York city taxi driver 
Tell me where you wanna go then I take you higher 
I am Lorenzo aka Jo va not ti 
I'm grooving like james brown I sing like Pavarotti 
I mix romantic flavor of a typical Italian melody 
With the urban hip hop sound of global technology 
Like the prophet I got vision I got messages for you 
This town is going to burn if you don't get into the groove 
I snitch and I snatch but I don't know what does it mean 
My baby 
Move your head to the beat never say maybe 
Life's gonna get you to be or not to be 
My blood's got salt of the Mediterranean Sea 
Good to make tears good to make sweat 
God bless you all and day we met 
Let me hear how you speak english everybody say oohh 
Fammi sentire come parli l'italiano dimmi oohh 
Quiero escuchar como tu hablas español dime oohh
Like dante I was flavor and I was born near the pope 
But I grew up just listening the sound of hip hop 
I am a funky funky freak and you can't steal to a bandit 
I give you my money baby so you can spend it
And the more you give it away the more I get rich 
I got a golden tongue a million dollar speech 
My english is bad but my sound is perfect 
For this everybody's giving me their respect 
I am the midnight train I am the genius of love 
I can materialize dreams taking it from above 
And also from down under where the sun doesn't shine 
My sound is so good like a super Tuscan wine 
And everybody go crazy to the beat of drums 
From paris to London from Tokyo to Amsterdam
I am the grandmaster of italian scene 
Sometimes I feel like a creation of a Fellini's dream 
Let me hear how you speak english everybody say oohh 
Fammi sentire come parli l'italiano dimmi oohh
Quiero escuchar como tu hablas español dime oohh 
Babylon babylon babylon by mouse 
Everybody go crazy when I am rocking the house 
Yo soy el matador del ritmo me llamano el ritmero 
Mi sonido es bueno sensual y verdadero 
Tengo el mundo en mi mano y el mundo es caliente 
Si tu quieres prenderlo te lo dejo a si tu siente 
Soy del mar mediterraneo cada ritmo es familiar 
El sur y el norte Istanbul y Gibraltar 
Me siento rico de carino y pobre de tristeza 
Cuando el ritmo del hip hop gobierna mi cabeza 
Puedo viajar por una vida y no me paro amigo 
No escuchar lo que digo ma mira lo que hago 
Life's gonna get you to be or not to be 
My blood's got salt of the Mediterranean Sea

Jovanotti,"Io lo so che non sono solo
Anche quando sono solo
Io lo so che non sono solo
Io lo so che non sono solo
Anche quando sono solo

Sotto un cielo di stelle e di satelliti
Tra I colpevoli le vittime e I superstiti
Un cane abbaia alla luna
Un uomo guarda la sua mano

Sembra quella di suo padre quando da bambino
Lo prendeva come niente e lo sollevava su
Era bello il panorama visto dall'alto
Si gettava sulle cose prima del pensiero

La sua mano era piccina ma afferrava il mondo intero
Ora la città è un film straniero senza sottotitoli
Le scale da salire sono scivoli, scivoli scivoli
Ghiaccio sulle cose

La tele dice che le strade son pericolose
Ma l'unico pericolo che sento veramente
E' quello di non riuscire più a sentire niente
Il profumo dei fiori l'odore della città

Io lo so che non sono solo
Anche quando sono solo
Io lo so che non sono solo
Io lo so che non sono solo
Anche quando sono solo

Sotto un cielo di stelle e di satelliti
Tra I colpevoli le vittime e I superstiti
Un cane abbaia alla luna
Un uomo guarda la sua mano

Sembra quella di suo padre quando da bambino
Lo prendeva come niente e lo sollevava su
Era bello il panorama visto dall'alto
Si gettava sulle cose prima del pensiero

La sua mano era piccina ma afferrava il mondo intero
Ora la città è un film straniero senza sottotitoli
Le scale da salire sono scivoli, scivoli scivoli
Ghiaccio sulle cose

La tele dice che le strade son pericolose
Ma l'unico pericolo che sento veramente
E' quello di non riuscire più a sentire niente
Il profumo dei fiori l'odore della città

Il suono dei motorini il sapore della pizza
Le lacrime di una mamma le idee di uno studente
Gli incroci possibili in una piazza
E stare con le antenne alzate verso il cielo

Io lo so che non sono solo
Io lo so che non sono solo
Anche quando sono solo
Io lo so che non sono solo

E rido, E piango
E mi fondo con il cielo
E con il fango
La città è un film straniero senza sottotitoli
Una pentola che cuoce pezzi di dialoghi

Come stai quanto costa che ore sono che succede
Che si dice chi ci crede allora ci si vede
Ci si sente soli dalla parte del bersaglio
E diventi un appestato quando fai uno sbaglio

Un cartello di sei metri dice
""è tutto intorno a te""
Ma ti guardi intorno e invece non see'è niente
Un mondo vecchio che sta insieme solo grazie

A quelli che
Hanno ancora il coraggio di innamorarsi
E a una musica che pompa sangue nelle vene
E che

Fa venire voglia di svegliarsi e di alzarsi
E di smettere di lamentarsi
E' quello di non riuscire più a sentire niente
Di non riuscire più a sentire niente

Il battito di un cuore dentro al petto
La passione che fa crescere un progetto
L'appetito la sete l'evoluzione in atto
L'energia che si scatena in un contatto

Io lo so che non sono solo
Anche quando sono solo
Io lo so che non sono solo

E rido, E piango
E mi fondo con il cielo
E con il fango su

Jovanotti,"Tu hai un buon karma 
Mi disse la commessa del negozio dei tarocchi
Che in casa aveva un gatto con gli occhi dai colori differenti 
E lo chiamava Bowie 
Di origine persiana, come i tappeti sui quali Sherazade 

Raccontava storie come fili di tappeti per volare, via da Baghdad 
Mercato immobiliare in espansione 
Per uno come me in cerca di attenzione 
Così lasciai la sua casa e i suoi incensi purificatori 
Perché mi stancai subito del mondo 
Visto da fuori, visto dai libri, visto dal cine, visto dalla TV 
Dal vero nonostante tutto lo amavo di più 
Col puzzo e col profumo, la nascita e la decomposizione 
Lanciai un altro dado per saltare un'altra posizione 
Nel gioco del mondo, che non si vince mai 
Mai, mai, mai, mai, mai, mai, mai 

Chi vuol restare fuori resti fuori
E alzino le mani i giocatori 
Chi vuol restare fuori resti fuori
E alzino le mani i giocatori 

Al confine tra il Pakistan e gli Stati Uniti 
C'è un chiosco che vende documenti usati 
Ne comprai uno di un vecchio sultano morto 
Affogato nella cioccolata dell'uovo di Pasqua 
Sciolto per il caldo del deserto e delle Cluster Bombs 
Ci misi la mia foto e venni accolto ad un ricevimento 
Alla Casa Bianca, lì riconobbi una mia vecchia fiamma 
Che era diventata segretaria di un ministro 
Lei non mi riconobbe col turbante e con il visto 
La notte al letto disse che le ricordavo qualcuno 
Che aveva conosciuto nel passato 
Pazzesco come è strana la vita mi disse 
Mi ricordi l'unica persona della quale sono stata innamorata 
E che ormai è scomparsa per sempre svanita 
Nel gioco del mondo, che non si vince mai 
Mai, mai, mai, mai, mai, mai, mai 

Chi vuol restare fuori resti fuori
E alzino le mani i giocatori 

Andando a visitare una mostra di un pittore 
Che dipingeva i quadri col suo sangue e con la sua saliva 
Entrai per caso in un salone di un altro pittore 
Che invece dipingeva col sudore ed una tigre viva 
Usando la sua coda come pennello, e il mondo come unico modello 
Ci feci conoscenza e mi spiegò che non aveva mai studiato arte 
Però comunicava con le bestie più feroci e sfidava la morte ad ogni pennellata 
Mi regalò un suo quadro, che regalai ad una mia fidanzata 
Che non riuscivo ad addomesticare, e adesso lei dipinge 
Usando i suoi capelli come pennello 
E la mia vecchia faccia come soggetto da reinterpretare 
Mentre io sono andato ormai lontano 
Mi trovo già in un'altra situazione 
E lancio questi dadi, e avanzo, di qualche posizione 
Nel gioco del mondo, che non si vince mai 

Chi vuol restare fuori resti fuori 
E alzino la mano i giocatori 
Chi vuol restare fuori resti fuori 
E alzino la mano i giocatori 

Messico, distretto federale 
Città di ventisei milioni di abitanti in cerca di un tesoro 
La mappa è scritta in codice sugli scalini di Teotihuacan 
Ma un incantesimo cancella il suo ricordo 
Nel momento in cui si scende e si ritorna in centro 
Eppure son sicuro che qualcosa mi è rimasto dentro 
Che quando prendo l'auto ultimamente 
Guardando il mondo dal retrovisore 
Io vedo la mia vita che va via, e non mi fa paura 
Anzi mi mette addosso un nuovo senso d'avventura 
Avere un'altra faccia sulla nuca 
Ha reso più complesso fare manovra 
Però non son più solo e son contento 
Da zero a dieci vale sempre cento 
Tra pace e vento scelgo sempre vento 
Scommetto sul futuro in espansione 
E butto il dado e cambio posizione 
Nel gioco del mondo, che non si vince mai 
Mai, mai, mai, mai, mai, mai, mai 

Chi vuol restare fuori resti fuori 
E alzino le mani i giocatori 

Cercavo il regno dei cieli sulla terra, 
Mi sono arruolato nella legione straniera 
Per fare finta di avere un passato da dimenticare 
Così sono finito a procurare le donne ai calciatori 
In fuga dai ritiri 
In cambio di ammirare i loro tiri da vicino 
Per imparare l'arte della precisione 
Unita alla velocità e alla strategia 
Tutto condito con la fantasia 
Che è quella cosa che non si può imparare 
Però si può riuscire a risvegliare 
Così a forza di guardare il pallone 
Presi una decisione 
E salii sul primo treno per un posto che iniziasse con la A 
E piantai le mie tende in Algeria 
Dove conobbi una nuova religione 
Che ti imponeva un sacco di rinunce 
Tranne di rinunciare alla paura 
Che quella più ce n'era e meglio era 
Ma grazie a Dio si fece presto sera 
E m'infilai nel letto di un'eretica 
Che mi scaldò col rogo dei suoi fianchi 
E continuava a dirmi già mi manchi, 
Perché sapeva che me ne sarei andato l'indomani 
Perché più che una scelta è vocazione 
A spingermi a lanciare un altro dado 
Per avanzare di qualche posizione 
Nel gioco del mondo, che non finisce mai, e non si vince mai 
Mai, mai, mai, mai, mai, mai, mai 

Chi vuol restare fuori resti fuori
E alzino le mani i giocatori 
Chi vuol restare fuori resti fuori
E alzino le mani i giocatori 

Al bar c'era Giovanni l'ottimista 
Si presentò e mi regalò il suo libro 
Che regalai a mio padre nel giorno della sua prima comunione 
Dicendogli di leggerlo come se fosse scritto in una lingua sconosciuta 
Dove ogni lettera vuol dire sempre vita 
In cambio lui mi regalò un cappello da Pinocchio 
Che io indossai a una festa d'ambasciata 
Dove incontrai la madre dei miei sette figli 
Ognuno nato in un continente differente 
Che si riunivano soltanto in occasione 
Di qualche guerra o di un'inondazione 
Oppure per comporre la canzone 
Che si erano impegnati a registrare 
Ma che ogni giorno continua a cambiare 
E che nessuno riesce mai ad imparare per intero 
E si ritrova immerso dentro a un coro 
Dentro una sinfonia senza spartito 
Che esprime come un senso d'infinito 
Ma con un ritmo più che sensuale, più che sensuale, più che sensuale 
Che fa venire voglia di giocare 
Al gioco del mondo, che non finisce mai, e non si vince mai 
Mai, mai, mai, mai, mai, mai, mai 

Chi vuol restare fuori resti fuori
E alzino le mani i giocatori 
Chi vuol restare fuori resti fuori
E alzino le mani i giocatori 

All'inizio era il caos 
Dal caos presero forma i nostri denti 
Fatti apposta per mordere mele 
Le nostre braccia per tessere vele 
E infine gli occhi per guardare l'orizzonte 
Non accontentarsi di pensare che quello che non si vede non esiste 
Che quello che non c'è non c'è mai stato 
Di conseguenza neanche ci sarà 
E questo non è vero 
Per questo il nostro gioco non finisce 
Per questo lo stupore è un demone che ti rapisce 
Finché ci sta qualcuno che si affida all'intuizione 
E getta un dado e avanza di un'altra posizione
Nel gioco del mondo, che non si vince mai, e non finisce mai 
Mai, mai, mai, mai, mai, mai, mai 

Chi vuol restare fuori resti fuori
E alzino le mani i giocatori 
Chi vuol restare fuori resti fuori
E alzino le mani i giocatori 
Chi vuol restare fuori resti fuori 
E alzino le mani i giocatori 
Chi vuol restare fuori resti fuori
E alzino le mani i giocatori

Jovanotti,"La coscienza apposto non ce l’ho
E non l’ho avuta mai
Neanche da bambino
Quando dicevo palle a destra e a manca
Non tanto per difesa
Ma più per fantasia
Per dare addosso alla supremazia della realtà
Per modellare il mondo da poterci combaciare
Come un biscotto nel suo stampino
Come un eroe nel suo destino
Non son mai stato un mago in strategia
Navigo a vista e ormai sono un esperto
Temo, ho rispetto
E amo il mare aperto
Ci soffro e mi diverto
A veder come gira
A gettar sassi
A piantare casini
A contraddire il fatto e i suoi indovini
Professo Dio se sono in mezzo agli atei
Se son tra i preti mi invento miscredente
A me la pasta piace sempre al dente
La vita mi va bene se si sente
Se c’è un po’ di corrente
Se c’è da attraversare qualche ponte
Se c’è da immaginare un orizzonte

Sarà ricordata come l’epoca della tecnologia
Ma per me è soltanto l’occasione per vivere la vita mia
Nel mio tempo, fino in fondo
Nel mio tempo
Nel mio tempo, fino in fondo
Nel mio tempo

Questo è il mio tempo
E non è mio soltanto
In bilico tra stimolo e rimpianto
È un tempo ricco gravito di segni
Vuoto di senso e pieno di congegni
Che danno possibilità infinite
Una, nessuna, e centomila vite
Portici, vertigini, equilibri instabili
Appuntamenti non più rimandabili
Onde che se non surfi resti sotto
E non c’è aria e sembra tutto brutto
Sporcarsi la pelle, bruciarsi
Toccare le cose con mano
Trovare l’immagine e poi proiettarla lontano
Alzare bandiera a mezz’asta
Già prima di essere morto
Mi è sempre sembrato un errore
Non tengo la nave nel porto
E se la bonaccia lo impone
Non resto a guardare il soffitto
Sperando che cambi stagione
L’ho detto, e poi ho fatto speso il contrario
Perché sono un uomo qualsiasi
Un essere straordinario
Un essere straordinario
 

Sarà ricordata come l’epoca della tecnologia
Ma per me è soltanto l’occasione per vivere la vita mia
Nel mio tempo, fino in fondo
Nel mio tempo
Nel mio tempo, fino in fondo
Nel mio tempo

Questo è il mio tempo
È quello che accade
Frequento i deserti e le strade
Non trovo risposte immediate
Del resto nemmeno le chiedo
Però credo fosse un errore
Che gli uomini abbiano un grande valore
Che è espresso in pochissima parte
E tutto concorre a sedarti
Confonderti, omologarti
In casa, poi a scuola, poi fuori
Ci vogliono deboli e soli
Al massimo consumatori
Che hanno reazioni a comando
Capite voi quello che intendo?
Capite voi quello che intendo?

Sarà ricordata come l’epoca della tecnologia
Ma per me è soltanto l’occasione per vivere la vita mia
Nel mio tempo, fino in fondo
Nel mio tempo
Nel mio tempo, fino in fondo
Nel mio tempo
 

Non lascerò il futuro nelle mani
Di chi al futuro non ci ha creduto mai
Di chi crede soltanto a questo dogma
Fotti per primo, o rimarrai fottuto
Io la coscienza a posto non ce l’ho
E fotto quasi sempre senza scopo
Perché la mia natura non è chiara
Sono allo stesso tempo gatto e topo
Siete il sale del mondo disse Jesus
E il sale è un conservante assai efficace
Lo usano per conservare il pesce
Ma non serve a conservar la pace
Vivo in quel pezzo di mondo
Dove il sale si compra inscatolato
E il grano cresce ormai già macinato
Metà del mondo lotta con la fame
La mia metà si nutre di aspartame
Io la coscienza a posto non ce l’ho
E non l’ho avuta mai
Sono il peggior nemico di me stesso
L’ostacolo più grande al mio successo
Tutto e anche il suo contrario
Monotono e poi vario
Affezionato ad ogni mio difetto
Ad ogni scusa, ad ogni litania
Non posso, scusa devo andare via
Ripasserò più tardi un’altra volta
Eccomi sono qua, l’uomo in rivolta
Questo è il mio tempo e spazio che divido
Con quello che mi sfida e che io sfido
Con quello che io accolgo e che mi accoglie
Con quello che io cambio e che mi cambia
Con quello che mi dona e che mi toglie
Con gli uomini, le macchine e le foglie
Restando in casa o attraversando soglie
Questo è il mio tempo, questa è l’occasione
Questo è lo spazio di contemplazione
È il campo di battaglia per l’amore
Il tempo di equilibrio e furore

Sarà ricordata come l’epoca della tecnologia
Ma per me è soltanto l’occasione per vivere la vita mia
Nel mio tempo, fino in fondo
Nel mio tempo

Jovanotti,"A te che sei l'unica al mondo
L'unica ragione per arrivare fino in fondo

Quando ti guardo
Dopo un giorno pieno di parole
Senza che tu mi dica niente
Tutto si fa chiaro
A te che mi hai trovato

All'angolo coi pugni chiusi
Con le mie spalle contro il muro
Pronto a difendermi
Con gli occhi bassi
Stavo in fila
Con I disillusi
Tu mi hai raccolto come un gatto
E mi hai portato con te

A te io canto una canzone
Perche non ho altro
Niente di meglio da offrirti
Di tutto quello che ho

Che con un solo salto
Ci fa volare dentro l'aria

A te che io
Ti ho visto piangere nella mia mano
Fragile che potevo ucciderti
Stringendoti un po'

E poi ti ho visto
Con la forza di un aeroplano
Prendere in mano la tua vita
E trascinarla in salvo

A te che mi hai insegnato I sogni
E l'arte dell'avventura
A te che credi nel coraggio
E anche nella paura

E resti sempre la stessa

Che sei una roccia sei una pianta sei un uragano
Sei l'orizzonte che mi accoglie quando mi allontano
A te che sei l'unica amica

Che Io posso avere
L'unico amore che vorrei
Se io non ti avessi con me
A te che hai reso la mia vita
Bella da morire

Che riesci a render la fatica
Un immenso piacere
A te che sei il mio grande amore

Si te encuentro en la calle
No me atrevo ni hablarte
Se bloquean mis palabras
No me atrevo a mirarte a los ojos
Y aunque suene imposible
Si pudiera amplificar el latir del corazón
Sentirías al baterista de una banda de metal pesado
Y hoy por eso estoy aquí parado
Porque me sale mucho más fácil con una de mis canciones
Para lograr que sientan hasta muros y platones

Y para no telefonear te digo todo cara a cara
Como si la pena no me importara
Soy muy tímido
Escondo amor en mi, no fallo
Para decirte que desde que te vi siempre es mayo
Y en mayo el mundo es bello
Y está lleno de colores
Y todavía en los árboles
Habitan sólo flores
Tarde que temprano van a
Derramar su fruto
Y dime cómo estas
Ansiosamente espero

Espero que este sentimiento sea correspondido
Yo estoy aquí delante y te quiero y te sonrío
Asómate a la ventana amore mio

Asómate al balcón
Responde niña por favor
Solo vine hasta aquí con torna mesa y un micrófono
Traje aquí a mi banda a cantarte lo que siento
Si tú me quisieras besar yo estaría contento

Es que esta serenata es mi cita con el destino
Pues quiero que en la vida estemos
Tu y yo siempre unidos
Una serenata rap para decir a ti
Me gusta como miras y lo que piensas de mí
Me gusta tu nariz en sinfonía con el mundo
Me gusta tu trasero, casi redondo
Que torna en un satélite a cada ser viviente
Me gustas por que eres, inteligente

Se ve muy claro en tus manos como las mueves
Y haces que hasta los sentimientos siempre me renueves
Tus caderas son los andes y tus pechos los volcanes
Me gusta tu buen gusto en la ropa con que sales
Que está muy por encima de la moda del momento
Una flor que así creció entre el asfalto y el cemento

Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío

Serenata rap, serenata metropolitana
Confía un poco en mí
Aquí estaré cada mañana
No debes creer las cosas que otros te digan de mí
Es que son muy envidiosos
Quizás porqué
Yo no te prometo historias de pasión como de guiones
De cine de romances solo falsas ilusiones
Yo te ofrezco la verdad, cuerpo, alma y un cerebro
Amor es solamente amor
Es solo solo eso

Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío

Amor que nadie ama se resigna a no lograrlo
Lo escribe en los muros
Y luego en el subterráneo de esta ciudad
Millones de habitantes que van día con día
Ignorándose hacia delante
Y después no sé porqué
Porqué, quién sabe cómo
Después no sé porqué
Porqué quien sabe cómo
Dos almas de repente se generan un destino
Palacios, ruido, smog son como un jardín divino
Personas entregadas intercambian un anillo
En un departamento que sera como un castillo
Asómate a la ventana amore mío

Tus caderas son los andes y tus pechos los volcanes
Me gusta tu buen gusto en la ropa con que sales
Que está muy por encima de la moda del momento
Una flor que así creció, entre el asfalto y el cemento

Col giradischi e col microfono

E se tu mi vorrai baciare
Saro´ contento
E questa serenata

Jovanotti,"Si vince, si perde 
Si pestano merde 
Che si infilano nelle fessure sotto la suola 
Si vive, si muore 
Si prova dolore dal quale 
Non c'e' un pensiero 
Che ti consola 
Si parla coi cani, si stringono mani 
Si fa spesso finta di essere qualcosa 
Si guarda il tramonto, si arriva in ritardo 
Ci piovono addosso macerie di vita esplose 
Si fanno dei figli, 
Si sognano sogni 
Si fanno castelli di sabbia sul bagnasciuga 
Si infilano perle di vetro nelle collane e si progetta una fuga 

Noi siamo l'elemento umano nella macchina 
E siamo liberi sotto alle nuvole

Noi siamo l'elemento umano nella macchina 
E siamo liberi sotto alle nuvole 

Noi siamo l'elemento umano nella macchina 
E ci facciamo del male per abitudine 

Si cerca di lavoro, si accumula stress
Che poi esplode in un improvviso cambio di scena 
Si cerca qualcosa che faccia spuntare 
Due ali di rondine dietro la schiena 
Si accusano gli altri, si saltano I pasti 
Si scende sotto a portare la spazzatura 
Si spianano rughe, si spigano spighe 
Si fa I conti con I mille volti della paura 
Si nasce in un posto, si prende una barca per arrivare dove poter nascere ancora 
Si mettono fiori tra pagine di diario per ricordarci un momento di vita vera 

Noi siamo l'elemento umano nella macchina 
E siamo liberi sotto alle nuvole 

Noi siamo l'elemento umano nella macchina 
E siamo liberi sotto alle nuvole 

Noi siamo l'elemento umano nella macchina 
E siamo liberi sotto alle nuvole 

Noi siamo l'elemento umano nella macchina 
E siamo liberi e siamo liberi, e siamo liberi 

Si fanno dei piani, si stringono mani 
Si firmano accordi che prevedono una penale 
Si sputa per terra, si perde la guerra 
Si pensa che alla fine poi tanto e' sempre uguale 
Si muove la torre, si copre l'alfiere, 
Si passa una giornata a difendere cio' che e' perso 
Si scrive la password, si entra nel network e per un po' si immagina tutto diverso 
Si studia un sistema, si pone un problema 
Si cerca di far presto per avere tempo che avanza 
Si scopre di avere un immenso potere ma non e' mai abbastanza 

Noi siamo l'elemento umano nella macchina 
E siamo liberi sotto alle nuvole 

Noi siamo l'elemento umano nella macchina

È una notte con qualcosa di speciale 
Una musica mi chiama verso sé 
Come acqua verso il mare 
Vedo un turbinio di gente colorata 
Che si affolla intorno a un ritmo elementare 
Attraversano la terra desolata 
Per raggiungere qualcosa di migliore 
Un po’ oltre le miserie dei potenti 
E le fredde verità della ragione 
Un po’ oltre le abitudini correnti 
E la solita battaglia di opinione 
Vedo gli occhi di una donna che mi ama 
E non sento più bisogno di soffrire

È arrivato il mio momento per partire 
Cosa pensa il trapezista mentre vola 
Non ci pensa mica a come va a finire 
Vedo I barbari che sfondano il confine 
E mi guardano dal vetro dello specchio 
E qualcuno che medita la fine 
Tutto il cielo si riflette nel mio occhio 
Le montagne che dividono I destini 
Si frantumano diventano di sabbia 
Al passaggio di un momento di splendore 
E spalanca la porta della gabbia

Jovanotti,"Una voce, un'immagine, un soffio 
Qualche cosa che un nome non ha 
Che mi parla nei posti più strani 
Tra l'amore e la pubblicità
Dentro al fondo di certi bicchieri 
Alle soglie del sogno di ieri 
Nella gonna che vola nel vento

Sono l'ospite dentro al tuo letto
Sei la gatta che vive sul tetto
Ogni cosa mi mostra un aspetto 
Di milioni di aspetti che ha
Paradisi vestiti da inferni
Superfici di mondi moderni 
E presagi futuri

Il mio naso non vede I colori
I miei occhi non sentono I suoni
La mia bocca non sente gli odori
La mia mano non tocca I sapori
Ma la voce che soffia nel vento 
Io, la sento
La risposta che soffia nel vento 
Io, la sento
La sento
È la pioggia che cade 
La sento
I sentieri e le strade 
La sento
È qualcuno che ride
La porta 
È aperta

Una notte che illumina un giorno
Un'andata che sembra un ritorno
C'è una macchia nel centro del sole
Il tremore di certe parole
La mia ultima volta da solo 
Ho sentito una spinta alle spalle 
Un invito a mollare I bagagli

Come un uomo che impara a volare
Una terra che emerge dal mare
Per la fine del mondo è prevista 
Una festa che inizia da ora
Puoi venire vestita così 
Oh mia bella signora
Puoi venire vestita così

Per comprendere il loro alfabeto
Segatura per terra nei bar 
Ha formato il mio fiuto
Se passate da casa dei miei 
Dite loro che è tutto perfetto 
Ho commesso le solite colpe 
Da carenza o da eccesso d'affetto

La tristezza è un ricatto 
È il delictum perfecto 
Cha fa vittime più della peste 
E non desta sospetto
Per la fine del mondo è prevista

Con un solo soffio, con un solo bacio
Grande mi scateno, poi di nuovo taccio 

Io son il deserto, sono l'altro mare
Quello che si espande, che entra nel tuo cuore
Quello del silenzio, quello dell'assenzio
Rido dei confini e delle gerarchie

Jovanotti,"Le meraviglie in questa parte di universo
Sembrano nate per incorniciarti il volto 
E se per caso dentro al caos ti avessi perso
Avrei avvertito un forte senso di irrisolto

Un grande vuoto che mi avrebbe spinto oltre
Fino al confine estremo delle mie speranze
Ti avrei cercato come un cavaliere pazzo
Avrei lottato contro il male e le sue istanze

I labirinti avrei percorso senza un filo
Nutrendomi di ciò che il suolo avrebbe offerto 
E a ogni confine nuovo io avrei chiesto asilo
Avrei rischiato la mia vita in mare aperto

Considerando che l'amore non ha prezzo 
Sono disposto a tutto per averne un po'
Considerando che l'amore non ha prezzo 
Lo pagherò offrendo tutto l'amore
Tutto l'amore che ho

Un prigioniero dentro al carcere infinito
Mi sentirei se tu non fossi nel mio cuore
Starei nascosto come molti dietro ad un dito 
A darla vinta ai venditori di dolore

E ho visto cose riservate ai sognatori
Ed ho bevuto il succo amaro del disprezzo
Ed ho commesso tutti gli atti miei più puri

E quando ti risvegli non puoi dimenticarmi
Spaziale come un razzo vado come un pazzo
E quando metto musica balla tutto il palazzo
Sono sulla scena da una vita prima che tu fossi nato
Sono il pionere, l'antenato
Al posto del microfono io usavo già una clava
Ho suonato al matrimonio della regina di Saba
Con il saggio Salamone, a lui ho dato dritte
Ho evitato ad alessandro diverse sconfitte
Ne so più di Aristotele in quanto a bella vita
Il mister chiama me prima di ogni partita
Io rimo con tutto quello che io mi trovo a tiro
E so tutte le lingue dal patois all'assiro
Io ero dentro internet prima che lo inventassero
Io sono i social network prima ancora che ci fossero
Metto insieme gli elementi per reagire
Tu non devi fare niente resta solo a sentire
È una formula segreta più segreta della coca cola
Non si impara alla TV non la insegnano a scuola
I cugini mi chiama mc il cerimoniere
Dispenso le scintille e creo le atmosfere
 
Se avessi le radici sarei un albero
E invece sulla terra posso muovermi
Se fossi fatto in serie sarei un numero
E invece sulla terra sono unico
Se avesse un'idea fissa sarei lapide
E invece sto vogando sulle rapide
Se non cambiassi mai sarei una formula
E invece sono vino sulla tavola

I pesci grossi stanno nelle acque più profonde
E qualche volta vengono in superficie e fanno ciao ciao
E fanno ciao ciao e poi tornano giù

Se avessi le radici sarei un albero
E invece sulla terra posso muovermi
Se fossi fatto in serie sarei un numero
E invece sulla terra sono unico
Se avesse un'idea fissa sarei lapide
E invece sto vogando sulle rapide
Se non cambiassi mai sarei una formula
E invece sono vino sulla tavola

Sulla mia spina dorsale è appoggiato il cielo intero
Lo sconfinato universo che prova a spingermi giù
E mi hai mostrato due contrari
E hai detto ognuno è vero
E mi hai lasciato qui da solo senza dirmi di più
Mi hai messo in mano una spada senza insegnarmi le mosse
Mi hai messo in guardia dal nemico senza dirmi chi fosse
Mi hai messo dentro una scuola e hai detto adesso impara
Ad abbassare lo sguardo e a non avere pietà
Mi hai dato il fiuto del cane
La coda del gatto
La corona del re
E il cappello del matto
Mi hai messo in una famiglia e hai detto affari tuoi
Adesso in questo casino prova a capire chi sei

Però hai messo un diamante dentro al mio cuore
Kebrillah
Kebrillah
Quando lo espongo al sole
Però hai messo una bomba dentro al mio cuore
Che è sempre innescata e pronta per scoppiare

Mi hai messo in tasca tre carte e hai detto adesso tira
Quello che viene viene e
Come gira gira
Mi hai dato tempo una vita per ritrovare l'uscita, mi son distratto e ad un certo punto non l'ho più cercata
E mi hai mollato nel traffico senza indicazioni
E proprio a me vengono a chiedere le informazioni
E adesso unisci i puntini dall'uno all'infinito
Questa è una festa per la quale non serve un invito

Però hai messo un diamante dentro al mio cuore

La foca rumina

Le tigri brucano
Le serpi saltano
I cani belano
Il muro è morbido

Quando lo espongo al sole,però hai messo una bomba dentro al mio cuore

E allora piangi, piangi forte
E ridi ancora più forte
Così che scoppi di vita
Così che scacci la morte
E guarda sempre in faccia il mondo e non avere paura di niente
Non abbassare lo sguardo di fronte alla gente
Potranno dirti bugie
Potranno prenderti in giro
È una partita che si gioca all'ultimo respiro
E se t'incazzi, incazzati come giusto che sia
Con tutta la potenza
Con tutta la fantasia

Perché hai messo un diamante dentro al mio cuore

Jovanotti,"Quando sarò vecchio, sarò vecchio 
Nessuno dovrà più venirmi a rompere I coglioni 
Quello che avrò fatto, l'avrò fatto 
Vorrò soltanto stare a ricordare I giorni buoni 
Molti che conosco saran morti 
Sepolti sopra metri di irriconoscenza 
Me ne starò vecchio a ricordare 
Che non ho ringraziato mai a sufficienza 
Chi mi regalò qualche rima baciata 
Chi mi ha fatto stare bene una serata 
Chi mi ha raccontato qualche bella storia 
Anche se non era vera 

Quando sarò vecchio, sarò vecchio 
Di quelli che nessuno vuole avere intorno 
Perché ha visto tutto e ha fatto tutto 
E non sopporta quelli che ora è il loro turno 
Mi rispetteranno come si rispetta 
Il tempo che separa lo studio dall'esame 
Spero di esser sazio dei miei giorni 
Eviterà il mio sguardo chi c'ha ancora fame 
Nella notte ascolterò disteso 
La goccia inesorabile di un lavandino 
Che scandisce il tempo come un assassino 
Come un assassino 

E poi magari un sabato di maggio 
Ad una stella chiederò un passaggio 
E a tutti I prepotenti dirò ancora 
“Con me voi non l'avrete vinta mai!” 
E poi una domenica mattina 
Ancora sulla pelle il tuo profumo 
A tutti I prepotenti dirò forte 
Con me voi non l'avrete vinta mai! 

Quando sarò vecchio, sarò vecchio 
Di sbagli inevitabili ne avrò fatti 200 
E per quelli che io ho fatto apposta 
Non starò certo lì a offrir risarcimento 
Se non sarò in grado quando è ora 
Mi va di farlo adesso che sono cosciente 
Prima che durezza ci separi 
Ringrazio tutti quanti, infinitamente 

Quando sarò vecchio punto e basta 
La vita che finisce mostrerà il suo culo 
Con la mia pensione di soldato 
Si sarà consumato tutto il mio futuro 
Darò del cretino a chi mi pare 
Dirò che tutti I libri non servono a niente 
E che mille secoli di storia 
Non valgono un secondo vissuto veramente 
Con chi ha combattuto per restare vivo 
Con chi mi ha aiutato mentre mi arrangiavo 
Con chi mi ha insegnato qualche cosa che 
Risplende dentro di me 

E poi magari un sabato di maggio 
Ad una stella chiederò un passaggio 
E a tutti I prepotenti dirò ancora 
Con me voi non l'avrete vinta mai! 
E poi una domenica mattina 
Ancora sulla pelle il tuo profumo 
A tutti I prepotenti dirò forte 
Con me voi non l'avrete vinta mai!",Quando Sarò Vecchio

Un bellissimo spreco di tempo
Un’impresa impossibile
L’invenzione di un sogno
Una vita in un giorno
Una tenda al di là della duna

Un pianeta in un sasso, l’infinito in un passo
Un riflesso di un sole sull’onda di un fiume
Son tornate le lucciole a Roma
Nei parchi del centro l’estate profuma

Una mamma, un amante, una figlia
Un impegno, una volta una nuvola scura
Un magnete sul frigo, un quaderno di appunti
Una casa, un aereo che vola

Baciami ancora
Baciami ancora

Tutto il resto è un rumore lontano
Una stella che esplode ai confini del cielo

Ooh, baciami ancora
Baciami ancora

Voglio stare con te
Inseguire con te
Tutte le onde del nostro destino

Una bimba che danza, un cielo, una stanza
Una strada, un lavoro, una scuola
Un pensiero che sfugge
Una luce che sfiora
Una fiamma che incendia l’aurora

Un errore perfetto, un diamante, un difetto
Uno strappo che non si ricuce

Un respiro profondo per non impazzire
Una semplice storia d’amore

Un pirata, un soldato, un dio da tradire
E l’occasione che non hai mai incontrato

La tua vera natura, la giustizia del mondo
Che punisce chi ha le ali e non vola

Invecchiare con te
Stare soli io e te sulla luna

Coincidenze, il destino
Un gigante, un bambino
Che gioca con l’arco e le frecce
Che colpisce e poi scappa
Un tesoro, una mappa
E l’amore che detta ogni legge
Per provare a vedere
Che c’è laggiù in fondo
Dove sembra impossibile stare da soli
A guardarsi negli occhi
A riempire gli specchi
Con i nostri riflessi migliori

Jovanotti,"Vedo nuvole in viaggio
Che hanno la forma delle cose che cambiano
Mi viene un po di coraggio
Se penso poi che le cose non rimangono mai
Come sono agli inizi
2013 un nuovo solstizio
Se non avessi voluto cambiare oggi sarei allo stato minerale.
Mi butto, mi getto tra le braccia del vento
Con le mani ci faccio una vela
E tutti I sensi li sento
Più accesi più vivi,
Come se fosse un'antenna sul tetto che riceve segnali da un mondo perfetto.

Sento il mare dentro a una conchiglia,
Estate,
L'eternità è un battito di ciglia.
Sento il mare dentro a una conchiglia,
Estate,
L'eternità è un battito di ciglia.

Faccio file di files
E poi le archivio nel disco per ripartire
Non li riaprirò mai,
Il passato è passato
Nel bene e nel male.
Come un castello di sale
Costruito sulla riva del mare,
Niente resta per sempre nel tempo
Uguale.
Mi butto, mi getto tra le braccia del vento,
Con le mani ci faccio una vela,
Aeroplani coi libri di scuola.
Finita, per ora
Inclinato come l'asse terrestre
Voglio prendere il sole
È il programma del prossimo trimestre.

Sento il mare dentro a una conchiglia,
Estate,
L'eternità è un battito di ciglia.
Sento il mare dentro a una conchiglia,
Estate,
L'eternità è un battito di ciglia.

Come un'orbita la vita mia
Gira intorno a un centro di energia,
Sento il tuo respiro
Che mi solleva
È una vita nuova.

Sento il mare dentro a una conchiglia,
Estate,
L'eternità è un battito di ciglia.
Tutto il mare è dentro una conchiglia,
L'eternità è un battito di ciglia.

E tutto il mondo è la mia

Jovanotti,"In questa notte fantastica
Che tutto sembra possibile
Mentre nel cielo si arrampica
Un desiderio invincibile
Che lascia una scia,
Come astronave lanciata
A cercare una via
Verso una nuova dimensione
Un'illuminazione

In questa notte fantastica
In questo inizio del mondo
I nostri sguardi si cercano
Con ali fatte di musica

Posso toccare il cielo
Lo posso fare per davvero
Lascia che questa atmosfera
Ti porti con sé
Non c'è più niente da perdere

Ti porto via con me
In questa notte fantastica
Ti porto via con me
Ribalteremo il mondo

Una cascata di bassi
Che fanno vibrare
La spina dorsale
Una manciata di ore
Da metterci dentro il delirio totale

Due come noi che si fondono
Per diventare una nota sola
Due come noi che si cercano
Dentro una musica nuova

Dentro una macchina suona
Una ritmica forte
Si sente da fuori
Un temporale elettronico
Lava la polvere dai cuori
Dj suona musica buona BPM 130
Respira, respiro

Ti porto via con me
In questa notte fantastica
Di questo inizio del mondo
Con mille storie che nascono

E mille amori che esplodono
In mezzo alla via
Fanno una luce più forte del sole
In questo spazio elettronico
Posso toccare il cielo

Ti porto via con me

Fa nascere il sole ti sento vicino
Come filmare una scena per dire
Chi siamo su un altro pianeta
In questa parte di mondo
La strada finisce
Comincia la vita

Senti il dolore
Si scioglie nel tempo
Che scorre e che scivola via
Non resterò qui a guardare
Ho già iniziato a viaggiare

Jovanotti,"Le meraviglie in questa parte di universo
Sembrano nate per incorniciarti il volto
E se per caso dentro al caos ti avessi perso
Avrei avvertito un forte senso di irrisolto

Un grande vuoto che mi avrebbe spinto oltre
Fino al confine estremo delle mie speranze
Ti avrei cercato come un cavaliere pazzo
Avrei lottato contro il male e le sue istanze

I labirinti avrei percorso senza un filo
Nutrendomi di ci che il suolo avrebbe offerto
E a ogni confine nuovo io avrei chiesto asilo
Avrei rischiato la mia vita in mare aperto

Considerando che l'amore non ha prezzo
Sono disposto a tutto per averne un po'
Considerando che l'amore non ha prezzo
Lo pagherò offrendo tutto l'amore
Tutto l'amore che ho

Un prigioniero dentro al carcere infinito
Mi sentirei se tu non fossi nel mio cuore
Starei nascosto come molti dietro ad un dito
A darla vinta ai venditori di dolore

E ho visto cose riservate ai sognatori
Ed ho bevuto il succo amaro del disprezzo
Ed ho commesso tutti gli atti miei pi impuri

Considerando che l'amore non ha prezzo
Considerando che l'amore non ha prezzo
Sono disposto a tutto per averne un po'
Considerando che l'amore non ha prezzo
Lo pagherò offrendo tutto l'amore
Tutto l'amore che ho, tutto l'amore che ho

Senza di te sarebbe stato tutto vano
Come una spada che trafigge un corpo morto
Senza l'amore sarei solo un ciarlatano
Come una barca che non esce mai dal porto

Considerando che l'amore non ha prezzo
Sono disposto a tutto per averne un po'
Considerando che l'amore non ha prezzo
Lo pagherò offrendo tutto l'amore

Jovanotti,"Mi sono perso in questo posto
Non l'ho mica fatto apposta
È un parcheggio gigantesco
Con il divieto di sosta
Per esempio quegli sguardi
Che ti sfiorano un momento
E puoi quasi naufragarci
Nelle storie che hanno dentro
Ci sono giorni che ho la sensazione
Di averti detto tutto
Poi succede qualche cosa
Che riapre la partita
È la strada che mi chiama
E non posso farci niente
Il mio posto è nel mondo
Tra le voci della gente
Partirò
È sempre questa voglia di vedere
Di andare dove portano le strade
E la in fondo che cosa c'è
E li in cima che cosa c'è
E se è vero che si vede
Un panorama che
Pacifica il cuore
Fa esplodere il cuore
In 7 miliardi di pezzi
Senza dolore
C'è una coppia che si abbraccia
Mentre il verde è già scattato
C'è un pianeta che fa il giro
E non sembra sia spompato
Un cinese dentro a un parco
Scava un buco per vedere
Se si arriva fino ad Hong Kong
Quanto ancora da scavare
Videocamere nascoste
Pianoforti con le ali
Nella giungla di Milano
C'è un gorilla e altri animali
È la strada che ti chiama

Senza dolore
Senza dolore
Senza dolore
Senza dolore
C'è una rabbia che si allarga
E allegria senza ritorno
Una fabbrica che chiude
C'è anche chi dice che sia un bel giorno
Un po' d'Africa in giardino
Una stella sull'asfalto
La città che mi somiglia
Un tesoro in un contrasto
Tutto il cielo si riflette
In un fosso tra due strade
Un messaggio sul display
È mia madre
È mio padre
È sempre questa voglia di vedere
Di andare dove portano le strade
E la in fondo cosa c'è
E la in cima cosa c'è

Jovanotti,"Che cos'è un amico
Nessuno lo sa dire
Centomila libri
Non lo sanno spiegare
Nonostante ogni giorno
Esca fuori uno
Con una teoria
Con qualche bella idea
La filosofia non me l’ha ancora detto
Come mai un casino
Sembra un posto perfetto
Come mai un difetto
Rende bello un viso
Come niente più del caos
Può essere preciso

Quanto abbiamo riso
E quanto rideremo
Come in quella foto
Che ho la faccia da scemo
Quante notti svegli
A raccontarci storie
A cantare canzoni
Cambiando parole
Forse è tutto qui
Che cosa vuoi che dica
Forse è proprio questo
Il bello della vita
Poter dire un giorno
È stata una fatica
Ma,
Ma ti voglio un bene dell’anima
Oh oh
Io ti voglio un bene dell’anima
Io ti voglio un bene dell’anima

Rimanerci male per una stronzata
Essere gelosi di una fidanzata
Fare finta di niente
Ma sentire nel petto
Che qualcosa manca
Ancora di non detto
Essere d’accordo
Che non si è d’accordo
Segnati sta cosa
Prima che mi scordo
Ridi perché a me il tramonto mi commuove
Dopo che un tramonto mi portò via il sole
E vai dal dottore anche se non hai niente
Io ho una soluzione per il medio oriente
Io trasformo in mito
Anche una gomma bucata
Tu daresti un occhio
Per una battuta
Forse è tutto qui
Che cosa vuoi che dica
Forse è proprio questo
Il bello della vita
Poter dire un giorno
È stata una fatica
Ma,
Ma ti voglio un bene dell’anima
Oh, oh
Io ti voglio un bene dell’anima
Eh eh
Io ti voglio un bene dell’anima
Oh oh
Io ti voglio un bene dell’anima

È forse tutto qui
Che cosa vuoi che dica
Forse è proprio questo
Il bello della vita
Poter dire un giorno
È stato una fatica

Jovanotti,"Everybody's going crazy
Everybody's going crazy when
I turn the volume on an my band begins to play
All the humans yes the humans everything
Becomes electric music gets the center of the way
Yes I know oh yes I know 
I don't know I don't know 
But escaping will not help to make it better
Let it flow let' it flow you
Go fast and you go slow
You go stupid you go smart or you go clever

Quando partono a suonare quelli che mi stanno intorno
Con I piedi battono la terra
Dura come è dura questa pietra questo asfalto
Questa sabbia questa cassa di chitarra
Piano piano si riscalda poi si scioglie e si modella
Come argilla tra la pelle tra le mani
Il tremore di una stella più c'è buio e meglio brilla
Nessuna distanza ci terrà lontani
In povertà mia lieta
Scialo da gran signore
Rime ed inni d'amore
Rime ed inni d'amore

I got a lion heart I am always ready to start
All the girls are dying at my feet
Got no money in my bill got the whole world in my will
I am rockin'like a king down in the street
Ho le stelle per gioielli tutti I cani miei fratelli
Costruisco paradisi di poesia
Tutta questa frenesia che rinuncia all'allegria
Non è roba che va bene a casa mia

Adelante y mas adelante como un Nino Como un amante
Voy ganando puntos en el videogame
Que se llama vida uno que es el juego del destino
Voy a evitar las balas bailando
Tra los Buenos y lo malos, asesinos y sicarios, 
en un mundo de peligro y dolor
Nací en roma la ciudad donde llegan los caminos
Y si tu lee a lo contrario es amor

En mi pobreza alegre
Vivo como un señor
Canto rimas de amor
Muchas rimas de amor

Sono poeta sono un cantante sono un filosofo brillante
Sono un altro da me stesso sono niente
Vivo dentro al mio castello senza tetto e senza torre
Costruito di materia inesistente
I own the sun
I own the sunset
And the sky draped over me like a blanket
I own the magnetic field
And the stratosphere shield
I have melodies lullabies war chants

In my poverty I am a lord
I squander rhymes
And love songs

Muchas rimas de amor
Canto rimas de amor

I go searching I go searching I go finding 
I go finding I go digging in the garbage of spacetime
Let go dancin and dancing go fighting 
and romancing I go mining golden nuggets in your mind
With my rhythm with my voice a machete cuts the noise 
Got a trail truth the jungle of concrete
Every girl and every boy every tool and every toy 
Will be jamming in the middle of the street

In povertà mia lieta

Jovanotti,"Lei arrivò che si sentiva stanca
Entrò in quel bar come se fosse in fuga
La vita capita che a volte arranca
Cerca una strada per dimenticare
Ordinò un tè ma senza averne voglia
E vide lui con quel giubbotto orrendo
Tutto il contrario di ogni suo percorso
C'era qualcosa però in quella sua posa da orso
Pensò al suo uomo pieno di contegno
Alla sua aura a quel suo grande impegno
Che non gli aveva mai detto ti amo
Col tono giusto che una donna sa
Decise subito in mezzo secondo
Quello che da una vita già sapeva
Che non esiste proprio niente al mondo
Paragonabile alla sensazione
Di essere importante per qualcuno
Di avere quell'amore
Che una si sente dentro

Lui stava zitto
Ma accennò un sorriso
Non era il massimo della prestanza
Ma aveva addosso certe sue ferite
Che si capiscono a chi sa cos'è
Presero un autobus per la rotonda
Che lui quel giorno aveva casa lì
Gestiva un tagadà nel luna park
L'idea le piacque e se ne impadronì
Adesso vivono in un caravan
Roba di lusso parabola satellitare
Che prende internet e le TV
Ma non la guardano quasi mai

Le venne confermato nel profondo
Quello che da una vita già sapeva
Che non esiste proprio niente al mondo
Paragonabile alla sensazione
Di essere importante per qualcuno
Di avere quell'amore che ora si sente dentro

Il suo ex marito la disprezza molto
Parla di lei con commiserazione
Ma certe volte gli ci va il pensiero
E sente un brivido di ammirazione
Per quello spirito che non capiva
Per quella donna che non tornerà
E a volte pensa di riconquistarla
Comprando fabbriche di caravan
Ma lei ora vive con il suo vagabondo
Che le conferma ciò che già sapeva
Che non esiste proprio niente al mondo
Paragonabile ad un po' d'amore

Ma ora lei vive con il suo vagabondo
Che le conferma ciò che già sapeva

Di avere quell'amore che una si sente dentro",Caravan Story
Jovanotti,"Una mela nella borsa come pranzo
I tuoi occhi fanno a gara con il sole
Un dolore che nascondi molto bene
Ma rimane come sfondo alle parole

Cosa è rimasto della frenesia sfacciata
Del piacere di non sapere che ore sono
Di un paese che ti stava su misura
Le sue curve la l'allegria la sua natura

È tutto qui coperto dal passaggio
Di stelle finte e raffiche di no
Ma se guardi un po' sotto e soffi forte
Torna tutto splendente lo so

La vita non aspetta che sia giusto
Il tuono non aspetterá il silenzio
L'amore dato non ritorna a posto
Ma resta in giro
E rende il cielo immenso
Il cielo immenso, Il cielo immenso

Un filo di rossetto al panorama
Un po' di ammorbidente all'orizzonte
Guardi negli occhi l'uomo senza sguardo
Come se avesse fine scritto in fronte

Sei sempre tu la boyscout con la pistola
La calciatrice con le ballerine
Quello che resta è un po' di una ragazza
Sdraiata come un fiume sul confine

Ma se guardi un po' sotto e soffi forte
Ritorna tutto a splendere
Lo so

La vita non aspetta che sia giusto
Il tuono non aspetterá il silenzio
L'amore dato non ritorna a posto
Ma resta in giro
E rende il cielo immenso
Il cielo immenso

E in fondo alle inquietudini ci troveremo
A ridere di questo nostro mondo scemo
Io non ti lascerò dormire
Senza quel sogno seminato insieme
E in faccia ai nostri incubi lo grideremo
In nome di una storia che parla di noi
Che non ci siamo arresi
E non ci arrenderemo mai

La vita non aspetta che sia giusto
Il tuono non aspetterá il silenzio
L'amore dato non ritorna a posto
Ma resta in giro
E rende il cielo immenso
Il cielo immenso, il cielo immenso",Il  Cielo Immenso
Jovanotti,"Il tuo sguardo è una tac
È una risonanza magnetica
Il tuo giudizio è libertà vigilata
O sedia elettrica
Nel cielo questa luna arroventata
Che rotola lungo il piano inclinato della vita
Come un flipper anni 80
Che ad un certo punto della partita
Partivano due palline in simultanea
È arte contemporanea
Ecco cos’è svegliarsi in questa epoca
Big data pata pata
Niente zucchero nell’aranciata
Io sono pazzo di te
Bellissima selvatica
Vestita da signora
Col ciondolo a forma di cuore
Che ha dentro la foto del suo grande amore

Il suo gatto
Con uno sguardo

Mi hai imprigionato
Mi hai liberato
Con uno sguardo

Con uno sguardo dei tuoi
Con uno sguardo dei tuoi
Nel giorno delle sirene
Io ascolterò il loro canto
Ma è scritto nelle mie vene
Che devo proseguire
Fino a tornare da te
Risalendo la linea dei tuoi pensieri
Che spaziano

Dalla politica alla chirurgia estetica
Dalla magia all’informatica
Dall’etica all’energetica
Alla bioetica
All’arte pratica
Io sono pazzo di te

Lanciatrice di piatti
E di contatti
Ho cliccato like sul tuo ombelico
Non voglio essere tuo amico

Mi hai imprigionato
Mi hai liberato
Con uno sguardo
Con uno sguardo
Mi hai ammazzato e resuscitato
Mi hai fatto sentire
Sul tetto del mondo e sul letto di noi
Con uno sguardo dei tuoi
Con uno sguardo dei tuoi
Voglio essere un tasto
Del tuo cellulare
La frana che blocca il tuo cammino
Poi ti offro un passaggio sulle mie spalle
La tua gonna di petali di stelle
La replicante di Blade Runner
Il tuo sguardo è un radar
È uno scanner
Ho comprato un banner
Per dirti che ti adoro
Non lasciarmi solo
Mi ci vuole un coro
Io sono pazzo di te
Io sono pazzo di te
Io sono pazzo di te

Colpi di fulmine
Che fanno impazzire le persone
Sacchetti della spesa vuoti
Trasportati dal vento
Cani che abbaiano in tutte le lingue
Senza nessun accento
Maestri elementari
Con emozioni complesse
Le mani fredde e la pelle d'oca
Le guance rosse
Una lucertola sdraiata al sole
Come un essere superiore

Come una scena del cacciatore

Senza bisogno che tu risponda
Ladri che entrano in pieno giorno

Ai piedi di alberi da concerto

Qui un giorno
Sarà tutto un deserto

Il tubo che entra nel braccio
La vena che scorre e riscalda
Il continente di ghiaccio

Ho fatto il classico
E ho ancora dentro qualcosa di giurassico

Che lasci un po' di tracce di rossetto

Jovanotti,"Sotto la curva del cielo
In un applauso di stelle
Ho salutato la mia gioventù
Per ritornare bambino,
Procedendo in avanti
Senza passare dalla saggezza
Masticando una gomma

Al gusto di bicicletta
Che non finisce mai
Neanche se te ne vai
E lo ridico ancora
Per impararlo a memoria
In questi giorni impazziti
Di polvere di gloria
E lo ripeto ancora
Fino a strapparmi le corde vocali
Ora che siamo qui

Noi Siamo Gli Immortali
Seduta dentro a un aereo
Con il biglietto di un’altra
Hai salutato la tua classe di eroi
Per fare il grande salto,
Per diventare la donna che sei
Attraversando oceani di sguardi
Senza passare dalla tristezza
Innamorandoti dei bugiardi
Masticando una gomma
Al gusto di dopobarba
Che non finisce mai
Tra mezzanotte e l’Alba
Te lo ridico ancora

Per impararlo a memoria
In questi giorni impazziti
Di polvere di gloria
E lo ripeto ancora
Fino a strapparmi le corde vocali
Ora che stiamo qui-a-a
Noi Siamo Gli Immortali

E hai disegnato a colori
Il mondo che hai immaginato
Te ne vai in giro a fare tentativi,
Finche non avrà combaciato
E fai il lavoro sporco-o-o

Per non far finta di essere pulito
Hai qualche super potere
Da usare contro il nemico,
Masticando una gomma
Dal sapore di infinito
Che non finisce mai
Che non finisce mai
Non so se si è capito
E lo ridico ancora
Per impararlo a memoria
In questi giorni impazziti
Che qui si fa la storia

E lo ripeto ancora
Fino a strapparmi le corde vocali
Ora che siamo qui
Ora che siamo qui
Ora che siamo qui

Jovanotti,"La forza di gravità
MI tiene in piedi
Se io mi fermo cado

Quello che credi
In equilibrio vado
La forza di gravità
MI tiene in piedi
Se io mi fermo, crollo
La Revolution
Come mi vedi
In equilibrio, ballo

Vivo sulla terra dalla nascita sono condizionato 
Da una forza che si chiama gravità
È una legge naturale che MI obbliga continuamente 
A confrontarmi con un tipo di energia
Tutto tende verso un centro verso una condizione 
Stabile di quiete per mantenersi vivi
Serve di riuscire a contrastarla con le forze 
Che trasformano tra moto ed entropia
Anche fare un passo oppure alzarsi la mattina 
È una resistenza al peso che mi schiaccia
Sviluppare un moto contrastante per riuscire 
A sollevarmi per andare a lavorare
Fare un scaturire un fuoco, rompere una pietra,
Affilarla e poi usarla per la caccia
Trasformare condizioni avverse in possibili 
Vantaggi è qualcosa che mi è dato DI tentare

Nel pianeta terra non c'è niente di scontato
Non l'amore, non la rabbia, non la stessa vita
Sono dipendente da una serie DI precarie condizioni 
Di temperatura, ossigeno e dimensione
Tengo ben presente che questo equilibrio di coordinate 
È il campo della mia partita,
So che l'Himalaya non è cosa più importante di un sorriso
DI un kalashnikovo di una canzone

La forza di gravità
MI tiene in piedi
Se io mi fermo cado
Revolution
Quello che credi
In equilibrio vado
La forza di gravità
MI tieni in piedi
Se io mi fermo
Crollo
La Revolution
Quello che vedi
In movimento ballo

Smaterializzare informazioni è l'approdo naturale 
Del mammifero chiamato essere umano
Dai segnali con il fumo alla Stele di Rosetta fino 
Alle operazione telematiche di chirurgia
Dalle statue di idoli di pietra ai confini 
Che si sgretolano come ghiaccio nel calore di una mano
Dalle grandi pietre alle mura di Micene 
A possibili esperienze di telepatia
Prendo la tua mano per tenermi collegato 
A una fonte che mi nutre tanto forte come il sole
Quando ci abbracciamo diamo vita ad un nuovo essere 
Lo sento me ne accorgo io lo so quando succede
Incrociare sguardi collegare I nostri cavi queste braccia
Questa voce che compone oggetti di parole 
Fisica quantistica che agisce inesorabile
Si manifesta sempre dentro a quello che uno crede

La forza di gravità mi tiene in piedi
Se io mi fermo cado
Revolution
Quello che credi in equilibro
Vado

Jovanotti,"Mi hanno detto sei un ingenuo 
Gli ho creduto per un po' 
Le ragioni erano valide 
Ma il sentimento no 
Sono nato in una terra 
Che mi ha dato quello che ho 
E so che perderò ogni cosa 
Che io non difenderò 
Ho ascoltato troppe volte quella stessa liturgia 
E la verità è più bella mascherata da bugia 
Certe volte la distanza 
Fa vedere meglio la realtà 
Non si vive mai due volte 
Non si muore mai a metà 
Non ho un nome 
Non ho un posto 
Non mi abituo ad andar via 
Tengo dentro e porto appiccicato addosso 
Quell’istante di magia 
Quando siamo come ora 
Insieme 
Quando siamo io e te 

Insieme 
Oh oh 
In un attimo che dura 
Per sempre 
Insieme 
Insieme 
Ci incontriamo come barche 
Che poi sfiorano poi via 
Un saluto da lontano 
Poi un eterna nostalgia 
Non è vero che si cambia 
Si peggiora casomai 
Si induriscono le arterie 
E si sciolgono I ghiacciai 
Non ho un nome 
Non ho un posto 
Non mi abituo ad andar via 
Tengo dentro e porto appiccicato addosso 
Quell’istante di magia 
Quando siamo come ora 
Insieme 
Quando siamo io e te 

Insieme 
In un attimo che dura 
Per sempre 
Insieme 
Insieme 
Oh oh 
L’istinto di sopravvivenza 
È la seconda legge della natura 
La prima legge è che io e te 
Siamo una cosa sola 
Siamo una cosa sola 
Siamo una cosa sola 
E non aver paura 
Non ho un nome 
Non ho un posto 
Non mi abituo ad andar via 
Tengo dentro e porto appiccicato addosso 
Quell’istante di magia 
Quando siamo come ora

Jovanotti,"Non si può tornare indietro
Non si può tornare indietro
Nemmeno di un minuto
È la regola di questo gioco
Puoi tentare di salire di livello
O restare dove sei
Come carne da macello
Nelle mani del tecnocrate d turno

Non si può tornare indietro
Le strade sono piene di detriti
Macerie di un passato che un giorno
Era stato un futuro entusiasmante

Quante cose non ci siamo detti
Per paura di non essere capiti
Troppe volte non ci siamo rivelati
Per paura di venire giudicati

Attraverso tribunati improvvisati
Che condannano già prima di sapere
C'è ancora un margine
Per cominciare a vivere
Con gli sguardi che si incrociano a metà
Nello spazio della dignità

L'alba è già qua
Per quanto sia normale vederla ritornare
Mi illumina di novità
Mi dà una possibilità

La scarpetta di cristallo
Che hai perduto una notte nella corsa
Puoi attendere qualcuno che ti cerchi
O proseguire scalza
Nella luna che si accende di riflesso
C'è una parte che rimane sempre scura
C'è chi dice che è la parte dove è adesso
E per sempre si rivela la natura

Si sta come l'autunno
Sugli alberi le foglie
E naufragar m'è dolce in quest mare
Felice chi è diverso
Essendo egli diverso
Ma guai a chi è diverso
Essendo egli comune

Poesie scritte sui muri dei bagni degli autogrill
Le sinfonie nelle pubblicità
Le barche che da Tripoli puntano a Lampedusa
E quelle che da Genova puntavano all'America
Al centro di un passaggio della grande mutazione
C'è un pezzo che si stacca dalla costa
E va in esplorazione di terre emerse
Dove piantare un nuovo rituale

L'alba è già qua
Per quanto sia normale vederla ritornare
Mi illumina di novità
Mi dà una possibilità

Non si può tornare indietro
Non si può tornare indietro
Nemmeno di un minuto
Ma c'è ancora un margine
Per cominciare a vivere
Con gli sguardi che si incrociano a metà
Nello spazio della libertà

L'alba è già qua
L'alba è già qua
Mi dà una possibilità
Mi illumina di novità

L'alba è già qua
L'alba è già qua
Mi dà una possibilità
Mi dà una possibilità

Jovanotti,"L'estate addosso
Un anno è già passato
La spiaggia si è ristretta ancora un metro
Le mareggiate
Le code di balena
Il cielo senza luna
L'estate addosso
Il gesso a un braccio rotto
La voglia di tuffarsi
Guardando entrarein acqua tutti gli altri
Ma lei mi ha visto
Che sono qui da solo
E forse parlerà con me
Canzoni estive
Minacce radioattive
Distanti come un viaggio in moto in due
Fino ad un locale aperto fino all'alba
Ricordo di un futuro già vissuto da qualcuno

Prima che il vento si porti via tutto
E che settembre ci porti una strana felicità
Pensando a cieli infuocati
Ai brevi amori infiniti
Respira questa libertà
L'estate e la libertà

L'estate addosso
Bellissima e crudele
Le stelle se le guardi
Non vogliono cadere
L'anello è sulla spiaggia
Tra un mare di lattine
La protezione zero
Spalmata sopra il cuore
L'estate addosso
Come un vestito rosso
La musica che soffia via da un bar
Cuccurucu paloma
L'amore di una sera
Gli amici di una vita
La maglia dei mondiali scolorita

Prima che il vento si porti via tutto
E che Settembre
Ci porti una strana felicità
Pensando ai cieli infuocati
Ai brevi amori finiti
Respira questa libertà

Jovanotti,"Senti
L’odore della strada dopo che ha piovuto
Non vergognarti mai di un dono ricevuto
Ti guardo uscire e un po’ mi sembra
Che vai sulla luna
E la distanza aumenta
E non sei più la mia bambina
I rami tuoi si allungano a cercare aria
Questo è il tuo viaggio
La tua vita
La tua storia
Che non è scritta nelle stelle
E nel passato
Puoi disegnarla col dito
Sul vetro appannato
Scolpirla nella montagna
Legarla ad un aquilone
Hai già imparato a non difenderti dalle emozioni
Come tua madre
Sei bella quando sorridi
Quell’aria che puoi fare tutto
Quando lo decidi
Le mani in tasca per il freddo che ti ghiaccia il naso
Lo sguardo basso per far finta di non farci caso
Al cuore in gola
Agli ostacoli scuri
Le guance rosse
Come frutti maturi
Vorrei
Portarti in fondo alla notte
Mostrarti il sole che sorge
Stringerti forte a me
E poi lasciarti andare
Vorrei
Che tu fossi felice
Come quando uno dice
Questo posto MI piace
E anche se non c’è pace
Ci posso camminare
Libera, libera, libera
Ci voglio camminare
Libera, libera, libera

Senti
L’odore della vita che non dà tregua
È amaro e dolce
E più ci provi a capirlo più non si spiega cos’è
Quel filo che ci lega
Che lega tutto a te
Che lega te e me
Più di un dovere più un sentimento
È la materia stessa di cui è fatto il mondo
DI cui è fatto il tempo
Che fa girare I pianeti
Fa partorire I delfini
Brilla negli orecchini
Vorrei
Portarti in fondo alla notte
Mostrarti il sole che sorge
Stringerti forte a me
E poi lasciarti andare
Vorrei
Che tu fossi felice

Jovanotti,"Everyone listen to the Afrobeat
Antibalas
Jovanotti in the street

Ho un battito DI cuore così forte
Che copre tutti gli altri rumori
MI dice vieni fuori
Mi grida vieni fuori
Ho cercato DI capirci qualcosa
Ascoltando migliaia DI opinioni
Ma mi sembra che nemmeno gli esperti
Sappiano fare previsioni
A forza di dire domani
Quel domani è arrivato fino a qui
E mi ha colto DI sorpresa
Ma ho già pronto un piano B
Entrerò nel tuo labirinto
Guarderò in faccia la medusa
Piuttosto che restare fermo qua
Ad inventarmi qualche scusa
Potrei girare un kolossal
Con scene da brivido e poi
Un lieto fine rassicurante
Come piace a Hollywood

Ma ora che sono qui
Melagioco
E salto attraverso il fuoco
E salto attraverso il fuoco
E salto attraverso il fuoco
Salto, salto, salto
Salto, salto, salto
Salto, salto, salto
Salto, salto, salto

Se provi ad ammazzare il tempo
Devi avere una mira perfetta
Perché se lo ferisci e basta
Poi scatta la vendetta
Il mattino ha l'oro in bocca
Se la sera ha in bocca un bacio
Non fermarti a parlare con nessuno
Quando sei al prossimo incrocio
MI hanno detto per suonare la chitarra
Può servire anche un corso DI cucina
La città dove vorresti vivere
Non la trovi nella cartina
Ma nella valle tra il collo e le spalle
Della donna che ti sorride
Aspettala fuori dal bar
Stanotte quando chiude
Potrei girare un musical
Con balletti da brivido
E un lieto fine rassicurante
Come piace ad Hollywood

Ma ora che sono qui io

Make a move, make a move
With the rotting groove
Antibalas, make a move, Jovanotti's groove
Potrei desiderare la roba d'altri
La donna d'altri
Truccare appalti
Far quattro salti dalla padella alla brace
Per far bella figura far quello che non mi piace
Fare indigestione di bocconi amari
Dare via la libertà in cambio di favori
Annusare la merda e poi dire profuma di fiori, buona! 
Essere mimetico dentro dentro al contesto
Lentamente omologarmi al resto
Fantastico, mistico, plastico, ritmico,
Mi faccio questo viaggio, niente di turistico
Prendo quel che viene, cerco di capire
Non rinuncio ad alzarmi ad andare
Verso quel posto che si sposta quando io mi sposto
La meta che scompare quando mi ci accosto
Tengo teso il filo, straripo come il Nilo
Non vendo la mia vita un tanto al kilo
Non scrivo con la stilo ma col sangue delle vene
Un misto di ambizione e vocazione
Fedele alla potenza dell'immaginazione

Tutto quello che non saprò mai
E che mi gira intorno
Mi tiene vivo
Tutto questo eterno movimento
Che noi ci siamo dentro
La gioia e lo spavento
Tutte le parole fuori tempo
Le strade senza scampo
Le orecchie che non vogliono sentire
Tutte le ragioni che non ho
Tutti gli orizzonti che non ho toccato mai
E poi c'è questa cosa che mi carica. Si chiama musica, musica
E poi c'è questo cosa che mi carica e viene dall'Africa, Africa

Tutte le città dove non sei
Tutti I fatti che sono miei ma mi interessano lo stesso
Tutte le parole che significano cose nelle lingue che non ho parlato mai
Tutte le mattine che mi sveglio con quell'odore addosso
Di incubi di un mondo che non gira
Tutte le periferie in rivolta in cerca di una svolta profumi che si mischiano nell'aria
Poi c'è questa cosa che mi carica. Si chiama musica
E poi c'è questo cosa che mi carica e viene dall'Africa, Africa

Tutte le ragazze alla pari I luoghi immaginari
Dove si sogna di ricominciare
L'odore della pista dei locali seminterrati
Dove nel buio ci siamo illuminati
I tradimenti le giustificazioni
Milioni di milioni di milioni di opinioni
Tutti le preghiere della gente
Tutte le pallottole sparate ad un bersaglio trasparente
E poi c'è questa cosa che mi carica. Si chiama musica, musica
E poi c'è questa cosa che mi carica e viene dall'Africa, Africa

Tutti gli algoritmi che mi contano
Guidano portano indicano cose da comprare
Ogni informazione condivisa che come una divisa
Ti rassicura e ti fa rassicurare
Tutte le mattine che mia madre si era svegliata all'alba per prepararci la colazione
Tutti gli ingranaggi che trasfomano il vuoto di un assenza nel palco della mia esibizione
Tutte le distanze immense nel mondo e nelle stanze
Gli specchi che riflettono le assenze
Le circostanze che obbligano a dire da che parte sto, da che parte stai
Tutto il ghiaccio sciolto nei bicchieri, le nuvole di ieri
La neve dell'inverno scorso
Il miracolo che arriverà
L'oceano attraversato nuotando a dorso
La fame, il disgusto, il lusso della scelta
Il mondo che rimane una questione aperta
La lotta per restare umani con qualche imprevedibile regalo tra le mani
E poi c'è questa cosa che mi carica. Si chiama musica
E pou c'è questo cosa che mi carica e viene dall'Africa, Africa",Musica
Jovanotti,"Per il soffio che alza la polvere

E il potere che hanno le idee
Che qualcuno ha piantato
Per vedere dov’è che mi porta
Questa strada che passa da qui
Per le palme che sembra che ballino
Quando il vento le scuote
Per la forza che sposta le isole

Per un nuovo pensiero che arriva
Senza averlo nemmeno pensato
Per il sole che mi brucia le spalle
Come fossi un neonato
Per I mille cavalli che corrono
Dentro al cuore di quelli che scappano
Perché quando la terra si sgretola
Ci sia un vento a sorreggermi

Si confonderanno le stagioni
Guardami negli occhi che s'incrociano coi tuoi
Stiamo insieme, offrimi da bere
Pensa a quanta gente che è passata già di qui
Quanti tradimenti e matrimoni
Pensa a quante volte sembra proprio che non va
E poi cambia tutto in poche ore
E non è scritto da nessuna parte che io e te
Avremo avuto vita regolare
Non è mica vero che tristezza ed allegria
Son distribuite in modo uguale

È un estate bellissima, è finita di già
Una moto che parte, una sonda su Marte
Un ricordo che brucia ancora
Perché è pieno di vita, è pieno di vita
È pieno di vita

Quando sarai lì a fare ginnastica
Mentre fuori c'è quel tempo grigio
Nelle cuffie a ritmo di una musica
Che ti porta in qualche posto figo
Tutti quanti presi da qualcosa di importante
Che non è importante per niente
Siamo indaffarati a cancellare le impronte
Della nostra vita precedente
E non è scritto da nessuna parte che io e te
Avremo avuto vita regolare
Non è mica vero che tristezza ed allegria
Son distribuite in modo uguale

È un'estate bellissima, è finita di già
Una moto che parte, una sonda su Marte
Un ricordo che brucia ancora
Perché è pieno di vita, è pieno di vita
È pieno di vita

Tutte le promesse che hai dimenticato, poi
Te lo dico, non ti preoccupare
In quest'avventura siamo tutti marinai
Non c'è vento che potrà ingannare
Dentro quel bicchiere di Tequila che berrai
Quando avrai qualcosa a cui brindare
Mettici una goccia delle lacrime che noi
Mescolammo infondo al nostro amore
E non è scritto da nessuna parte che io e te
Avremo avuto vita regolare
Non è mica vero che tristezza ed allegria
Son distribuite in modo uguale

Di star ci a pensare che poi tanto boh
A me non mi piace io credo che invece 
Il tempo è prezioso davvero un bel po'
Io quando ti guardo mi basta guardarti 
E una bella notizia che porta allegria non c'è 
Un paragone non è che un milione di altre notizie ti portano via
A forza di essere molto informato so poco di tutto 
E dimentico di guardarti negli occhi sbloccare 
I miei blocchi alzare il volume e pensare che si
Oh si

E lan cia in aria il mondo e lo riprende al volo
Trasforma un pomeriggio in un capolavoro

Se metti un vestito stampato a colori in gara coi fiori
Per me vin ci te non è l'apparenza ma 
È l'apparizione che ti fa risplendere davanti a me
Sei luce di stella permetti la vita 
Qui nel mio pianeta tutto parla DI te 
Il sangue che brilla la mia clorofilla 
Che scorre nel legno DI mille chitarre
Di mille violini suonati dal vento 
Di mille telefoni in cerca di campo 
È meglio per te che quando ti guardo 
Non sai che ti guardo così come se

Potrebbe de cidere chi non ce n'è e mettersi 
In posa cambiare qualcosa invece è bellissima così com'è 
Così com'è, così com'è

Tu sei la mia luna ti sei la mia dea
Che sale e che scende si spegne e si accende
Governa gli amori
Su e giù la marea e man di I gatti sui tetti a star fuori le notti
Che poi quand'è giorno ti sembrano pigri
Ma è solo stanchezza che tutta l'ebrezza 
Di notti d'amore da piccole tigri 
Si sentono allegri si fingono saggi domesti ci 
E lenti un po' come noi con divi diamo 
La stessa natura selvatica in fondo che bella 
Che sei se il frigo è deserto mi porti all'aperto
Vogliamo una mela e mi passa la fame
E quando MI perdo e non mi ricordo mi basta pensarti 
E poi mi ricordo il mio posto dov'è
Il mio posto sei te

Jovanotti,"E adesso a letto bambini
Spegnete la tv
Troviamo un posto dove stare
Solo io solo tu

Sincronizziamo I cuori sullo stesso bpm
Silenzia il cellulare che non ti serve a niente
A meno che non voglia fare una fotografia
Di noi che ci abbracciamo forte e poi decolliamo via

A bordo di un'astronave
Senza pilota
Che punta verso la galassia a cercare dove c'è vita
Come nei sabati sera in provincia
Che sembra tutto finito poi ricomincia

Sabato sabato
E' sempre sabato
Anche di lunedì sera
E' sempre sabato sera
Quando non si lavora
E' sempre sabato
Vorrei che ritornasse presto
Un altro lunedì

Strappa le stelle dal cielo
Lascia solo I led
Voglio ballare come Michael nel video di Bad

Stare leggeri come due farfalle appena
Venute fuori dal bozzolo sulla scena
Sembrano tutti più contenti di noi
Ma per un giorno lo sai
Possiamo essere eroi

A bordo di un'astronave
Senza pilota
Che punta verso la galassia dove c'è vita
Come nei sabato sera in provincia
Che sembra tutto finito poi ricomincia

Sabato sabato
E' sempre sabato
Anche di lunedì sera
E' sempre sabato sera
Quando non si lavora
E' sempre sabato
Vorrei che ritornasse presto
Un altro lunedì

Dillo a tua madre di andarsene a letto tranquilla
Tu sei la bionda stasera, io sono il gorilla
Ti porto a vedere il mare vicino al grattacielo
Mentre I cecchini ci sparano noi prendiamo il volo

A bordo di un'astronave
Senza pilota
Che punta verso la galassia a cercare vita
Come nei sabati sera in provincia
Che sembra tutto finito poi ricomincia

Come in un sabato sera italiano
Che sembra tutto perduto poi ci rialziamo

Sabato sabato
E' sempre sabato
Anche di lunedì sera
E' sempre sabato sera
Quando non si lavora
E' sempre sabato
Vorrei che ritornasse presto
Un altro lunedì

Ma è troppo sabato qui
Un altro lunedì
E' troppo sabato qui",Sabato
Jovanotti,"Come partire e attraversare
Un tratto di mare piuttosto breve
Che divide l'Africa dal nord
Come una specie di arcobaleno
Come una pentola d'oro
Una linea di sangue
La promessa di un piatto pieno
O di quello che c'è dentro
Per lo meno
 
Come lasciare un'impronta di mano
Sulla polvere di un pianoforte
Che nessuno ha suonato mai
Strade bianche strade torte
Per raggiungere il mercato
Comprare pezzi di vecchi razzi
Costruirci un'astronave
Per volare sopra ai palazzi
 
Come quando nella notte
Guardi il nero della mia pupilla
Vedi accendersi una scintilla
Vedi accendersi una scintilla
 
Come quando nella notte
Guardo il nero della tua pupilla
Vedo accendersi una scintilla
Una scintilla
 
Perché io sono l'animale
E tu sei l'uomo col fucile
E per quanto tu ti sforzi
Non avrai mai il mio stile
Perché io vivo nel passaggio
Come la flora dell'intestino
E frequento le cose possibili
Tra il parabrezza e il moscerino
Come quando la gente balla
Diventa benzina sui pistoni
E si fonde con il ritmo
Come aria nei polmoni
Come lasciarsi alle spalle il rimpianto
Di quello che poteva essere e non è stato
Non ho occhi dietro alle testa
E nemmeno di lato
 
Come quando nella notte
Guardi il nero della mia pupilla
Vedi accendersi una scintilla
Vedi accendersi una scintilla
 
Come quando nella notte
Guardo il nero della tua pupilla
Vedo accendersi una scintilla
Una scintilla
 
Uno due pronti partire
Il primo passo poi proseguire
Non puoi tenere un drago al guinzaglio
Tempo che scappa non puoi domarlo
Luci di città che vedi
Dietro alla linea dell'orizzonte
Terra dove far battere in piedi
Occhi di femmina in mezzo alla gente
Come un approdo un sogno una via
So che significa quell'energia
Di una scintilla che incendio diventa
Fonde i metalli e le anime inventa
Pronte a tutto
Mani che suonano in jam
Nasce la musica
Sempre più big sempre più bang
Sempre più cruda sempre più glam
Sempre più post sempre più lost
Sempre più sud sempre più west coast

Come quando nella notte
Guardi il nero della mia pupilla
Vedi accendersi una scintilla
Vedi accendersi una scintilla

Le terre incognite
Le danze cosmiche
La spazzatura è sempre un'ottima risorsa
Il pane e anche le rose
La vita e anche la borsa
Ballerò sul tempo pari
Schivando gli spari
Cantami o musa delle sabbia mobili
Che inghiottiranno tutti gli spioni
E chi si crede di avere ragione
Solo perché qualcuno gli dà ragione
Questa cosa che non molla e cresce
Come erba in uno spartitraffico
Si fa largo e ti stupisce
Riesce a ballare anche sul lastrico

Come quando nella notte
Guardi il nero della mia pupilla
Vedi accendersi una scintilla
Vedi accendersi una scintilla

Come quando nella notte
Guardi il nero della mia pupilla
Vedi accendersi una scintilla
Vedi accendersi una scintilla
Una scintilla, una scintilla, una scintilla",Una Scintilla
Jovanotti,"Una chitarra da sola per una sinfonia,
Tutti i concerti del mondo nella tua suoneria,
Che mi emoziona, pensa che storia

Non mi ricordo mai i nomi delle costellazioni
Ma riconosco a memoria la luce dei lampioni mentre disegnano
Il tuo profilo quando sei in macchina di notte accanto a me
E ritorniamo a casa, per questa nostra strada o ce ne andiamo in giro,
Sospesi in un respiro
La sensazione di esser salvo anche nella tempesta
E la malinconia che nonostante tutto resta
Quella canzone,
Che sembra sempre che parli di noi e procediamo incerti,
Coi nostri pugni aperti o ce ne andiamo in giro sospesi in un respiro

Come un secondo prima di vederti,
Lampo di vita che entra nei miei occhi aperti,
Col tuo bagaglio di promesse senza parole,
Come se tutta la mi vita fosse nel tuo nome

Come quel sabato sera, che non ti conoscevo ancora,
Poi siamo stati insieme,
Proprio come nelle favole
E nelle storie vere
Proprio come nelle favole
E nelle storie vere

La sentinella piazzata fuori dal mio cuore,
Forse era solo distratta e non ti ha visto entrare, e meno male
Pensa che cosa ti saresti persa,

Il più incredibile spettacolo di un uomo che,
Pensava di essere da solo e poi ha incontrato te
E adesso ha un impero e l'universo intero
E tu la mia regina, nobile contadina,
E ce ne andiamo in giro, sospesi in un respiro,
Come nell'attimo in cui ti ho baciato,
Con quel sapore di mattino fresco di bucato,
Col tuo bagaglio di promesse senza parole,
Come se tutto il mio futuro fosse nel tuo nome
Come quel sabato sera, che non ti conoscevo ancora,
E poi ci siamo messi insieme,
Proprio come nelle favole e nelle storie vere
Proprio come nelle favole e nelle storie vere
Proprio come nelle favole e nelle storie vere

E nelle storie vere
E nelle storie vere",Le  Storie Vere
Jovanotti,"Posso riuscirci io
a portarti fuori e a farti stare
bene come non sei stata mai
Provo a farlo io
A mostrarti le bellezze quelle che nemmeno tu le sai

Non mandarmi solo
Fare un giro nella notte quella che non si può mai fermare
Ci saliamo al volo
Ci tuffiamo dentro al ritmo senza niente da considerare

E finché c'è una musica che gira
Un petto che respira
E una ritmica che tira
E un impianto che spara
Ovunque sia dall'Africa all'Antartide
Qualcuno sta tendendo acceso il fuoco

Qua svegliamo la città
Stanotte resta tutto acceso
Tutto acceso
Qua prendiamo la città
Non voglio più vedere quell'ombra nei tuoi occhi

Lascia fare a me
È l'amore che mi guida
Non c'è niente di più bello di una sfida
Tira anche a te
Di scappare, di sentirti nuovamente totalmente viva
Voglio farlo ora
Sulla solita canzone che ogni volta sembra sempre nuova
E lo sai perché
Perché lei è sempre la stessa
Quelli nuovi siamo io e te

E finché c'è una radio che trasmette
Un sogno che non smette
Un volo di notte
Un cuore che combatte
Ovunque sia dall'Africa all'Antartide
Qualcuno sta tendendo acceso il fuoco

Qua svegliamo la città
Stanotte resta tutto acceso
Tutto acceso
Qua prendiamo la città
Stanotte resta tutto acceso
Tutto acceso

C'è sempre qualcuno che ti dice che non si può
C'è sempre qualcuno che ti dice di arrenderti

Ah,
Sei stata coraggiosa a scegliere di fare
Come avevi in testa te
Non hai lasciato che le cose ti condizionassero
Nell'essere bella e vera come una regina africana
In mezzo alla tecnologia
Venere di spiaggia libera nata da un'onda di malinconia

Qua svegliamo la città
Stanotte resta tutto acceso
Tutto acceso
Svegliamo la città
Stanotte resta tutto acceso
Tutto acceso

Chiaro che non c'è ragione
Né una soluzione a quello che non gira
Sennò provo ad addentrarmi nella zona rossa della vita vera
Dove I semafori sono arancione
E si accendono I sensi delle persone
Attenzione qualcosa succede
Il ritmo che batte fa battere I piedi
Il piede trasmette la scossa alle mani
Che si alzano in alto
Come palme mosse dal vento
Come stelle del firmamento
Da zero a dieci cento
Da zero a dieci cento
Da zero a dieci cento
Da zero a dieci cento

Stanotte resta tutto acceso
Tutto acceso
Qua
Svegliamo la città
Stanotte resta tutto acceso
Tutto acceso qua",Tutto Acceso
Jovanotti,"Ripenso a quante volte
Mi ha sorpreso la vita
Da quando io sto insieme a te
Mischiato le carte
Truccato il motore
Partenze poi arrivi
E poi improvvisare
Il sole che cambia
Il colore alle cose
È sempre lo stesso
Inchiodato lassù
Ma non fa mai
Il suo solito giro la vita
Fa un orbita un giorno
E poi non la fa più
Ripenso ai pensieri
Di pietra e silenzio
Spazzati dal vento che va
I fiumi gli oceani
Creati al momento
Il nostro universo a metà
Per sempre o una volta
Per caso o per forza

E c'eravamo noi
E ci siamo lanciati
E con un'ala a testa
Siamo voltati via

Nel vento degli innamorati
Nel vento degli innamorati
Nel vento degli innamorati
Amore mio, amore mio, amore mio, amore mio
Ripenso al tuo viso che scende da un treno
E inonda di fiori la sera
Bellezza che appare
Scompare e mi chiede
Di crederci senza paura
Cambiare per sempre
Non stare a pensare a quello che succederà
Le cose da perdere e quelle da fare
Il nostro universo a metà
Per sempre o una volta
Per caso

Feel the summer on my skin
In a thousand songs I want to hear
I'm still waiting for my wave
The sun sets on another day

Prima che il vento
Si porti via tutto
E che settembre ci porti una strana felicità
Pensando ai cieli infuocati
Ai brevi amori infiniti
Respira questa libertà
L'estate è la libertà

Here comes the summer
And everything I wish for comes
Shining like a sunrise on the beach
Don't think about September
When all I will remember is
The sweet taste of the salt on my skin

You'll fall in love so deep it almost hurts
You'll smile without a reason,
You'll ride for miles to see her

Me encontre una caleña preciosa, hermosa
Que la mente me daña
La que me hace sacarme un truco de la manga
Llevarmela para bucaramanga
La tomaran por el puerto de buenaventura
Para vivirnos una aventura
Tu belleza me lleva a la locura
Con tigo yo quiero ver las estrellas

Y no te borraste de mi mente 
No te importo lo que dijo la gente 
Que yo era un delincuente 

Te quedaste conmigo 
Las rosas mas hermosas rodeaban tu castillo 
Eres la princesa del corazón mío 
Cuando tengo frío solo en ti me cobijo 

Mi corazón solo piensa en ti 
Solo llora por ti, solo sufre por ti
Mi corazón solo piensa en ti 
Solo llora por ti, solo sufre por ti

Cuanto tiempo tengo que esperar 
Para tenerte en mis brazos 
Decirte cuanto te amo 
De este sueño no quiero despertar 
Quiero dormir a tu lado 
Decirte cuanto te amo 

Yo quiero que sepas que te anhelo 
Que el amor que siento por ti es puro sincero 
Brillan en el cielo como miles de destellos 
Solo me recuerdo el aroma a tu cabello 

Mi corazón solo piensa en ti 
Solo llora por ti, solo sufre por ti

Se me sube a la cabeza
Se me sube si me besas

Cuando suda que preciosa
Cuando sube como goza

Y baila a lo loco
Y bailalo a lo loco

Si esta loca y te patina el coco
Y baila a lo loco

Que traigan mas botella
Que hoy vamo' a celebrar (Party party)
Bailalo a lo loco
Que estamo' to' bien loco
Que estoy explotando,
Y que meneandote (party party)
No fumes cigarrillos por eso te hace mal
No sea tan mala onda ven vamos a bailar (Party party)

Me vale si me besa
Estamo' bien loco bailando bien loco y malvada a mi me interesa (party)

Asuman sus posiciones
Suban sus manos, arriba en el aire
Goza esta noche, como si fuera la ultima noche del mundo

No pares que tu estas haciéndolo
Sigue gozando, sigue sacudiendolo
No pares sigue moviendo
Baila a lo loco que esta amaneciendo
Que en la pista estamos bebiendo
Dos tequilazos y en fuego me prendo, vamos pal hotel

Porque siga

Que esto no pare (mami que no pare)

When I feel the time is right and you're staying by my side
And the love you gave to me makes my heart beat
When my fantasy flies away but my feelings make me stay
I see the fire in your eyes, it makes my heart beat
Do it, we'll still do it night and day

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Joy and the Boy,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window 
Staring at a son that she just can't touch.
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side, 
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all, 
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,
Another body laying cold in the gutter.
Listen to me.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation, 
But he just can't see.
She give him loving that his body can't handle, 
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me.""
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror, 
But he doesn't recognize his own face.
His health is fading and he doesn't know why.
Three letters took him to his final resting place.
Y'all don't hear me.
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
I seen rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you
 
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.

Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Sind mit dir widerlegt
Will keinen Frieden, will keine Gedanken
Will, dass du weißt, was ich nicht will
Bin nicht mit dir, ich bin nicht einverstanden
Doch neulich war die Angst mal still

Blut ist nicht immer dicker als Wasser
Doch am Ende sind wir gut
Blut ist nicht immer dicker als Wasser
Doch der Grund verliert die Wut
Bin so oft an dir gefallen
Zu dir zu halten war nie leicht
Doch irgendwann wird das, was war
Nur die Erkenntnis und die bleibt
Blut ist nicht immer dicker als Wasser
Doch am Ende sind wir gut

Hast nichts getan
Doch hast mich angegriffen
Mein Herz schlägt ohne Verstand
Hat keinen Platz für dich und keine Mitte
Hab mich so nie zuvor gekannt
Du tatst mir weh wie nur ein Feind
Einen zu verletzten scheint
Was wir auch sind, keine Wahrheit stimmt
Nichts zu verzeihen
Aber irgendwann gelingt's

Blut ist nicht immer dicker als Wasser
Doch am Ende sind wir gut
Blut ist nicht immer dicker als Wasser
Doch der Grund verliert die Wut
Bin so oft an dir gefallen
Zu dir zu halten war nie leicht
Doch irgendwann wird das, was war
Nur die Erkenntnis und die bleibt
Blut ist nicht immer dicker als Wasser

Und es schießt durch meine Venen
Das Gefühl, dich zu erwähnen
Wie ein Zweifel, der nie geht
Der niemals schweigt
Konnt so oft nicht anders denken
Es geht über meine Grenzen
Du bist, du kannst für nichts
Und du bist frei

Blut ist nicht immer dicker als Wasser
Blut ist nicht immer dicker als Wasser
Blut ist nicht immer dicker als Wasser
Blut ist nicht immer dicker als Wasser
Doch am Ende sind wir gut

Gut

Joy Denalane,"Es gab schon immer kalte Kriege

Spricht so viel dafür

Nur aus Liebe geschieht
Und es das mit uns, das mit uns, das mit uns

Schon immer einen, der Geschichte schreibt
Schon immer haben Menschen ihre Ängste
Und immer Träume einer besseren Zeit
Schon immer gab es jene, die aus Steinen
Keine Mauern sondern Brücken bauen
Verliert sich im Großen wieder mal das Kleine

Nur zwischen den Sätzen stehen
Momentaufnahmen
Scheinen die besten Szenen zu sein

Wenn es scheiße geht
Muss ich mir eingestehen
Wir bauen uns auf, bauen uns zu
Bauen den Mist so hoch
Dass jeder ihn sehen kann
Manchmal nur
Dass ich irgendetwas erzählen kann
Klingt verrückt, aber nebenan
Machen sie das auch, also demnach
Gibt es keinen, der es nicht verstehen kann
Alle gehen nach
Gehen zu Grunde dran zu weit zu gehen
Halt die Welt an, weil sie sich ohne uns
Sowieso nicht weiterdreht
Muss mir eingestehen
Ich schreibe so so schöne Dinge
Wenn es scheiße geht
Doch was schreib ich dir, wenn es klar geht
Du bist so – ach, keine Ahnung –
Wie du da stehst
Dieser Ort, diese Zeit
Sie verlieren Relevanz
Wenn ich dich nur anseh', yeah

Wenn sie spricht, sind alle still
Alle schauen, wenn sie
Durch die Straßen zieht
Sie lebt immer nur im Jetzt
Macht ihr eigenes Gesetz

Sie schaut dir direkt ins Herz
Und ganz egal, ob du dich wehrst
Ein Wimpernschlag
Und schon gehörst du ihr
Und die anderen wären gern wie sie
Sie ist gefürchtet und geliebt
Wenn sie dabei ist, weiß man nie
Was noch passiert

Will mit dem Kopf durch Wände gehen
Sie kann jederzeit das
Was sie will bekommen
Für sie ist alles kein Problem
Und keiner kann ihr widerstehen
Denn ihrem Zauber kannst du
Einfach nicht entkommen
Und man ist da, wenn sie’s verlangt
Sie hat vor nichts und niemand Angst
Wenn sie den Ton angibt

Und manchmal ist sie ungerecht
Doch meistens ist sie nur zu frech
Doch eigentlich will sie,
Dass die ganze Welt sie liebt

Krieg kein Auge zu

Denke über nichts und alles nach
Das Bett erscheint unendlich leer und weit
Die Zeiger drehen sich mit mir im Kreis
Schlaflos vergeht die Zeit

Drei Uhr zwanzig und im Nachtlicht
Werden alle Schatten übergroß
Tausend Fragen, ich hör mich atmen
Der Sturm in mir lässt mich nicht los
Wer soll ich sein und wo will ich hin
Macht dieses Chaos irgendwann Sinn

Perspektiven, die fehlen
Denk an Mama, wie sie älter wird
Denk daran, wie mich die Welt verwirrt
Krieg im Kopf das Gefühl zu kleiner Räume

Vom Reich der Träume (Träume)
Denk an Rechnungen und die To Do’s

Ein roter Fleck auf dem Taschentuch

Und das Spiegelbild im Fenster zeigt verschwommene Gespenster
Nichts scheint wirklich zu stimmen

Ich bleib in deinen Fußstapfen stehen
Ist nicht leicht für mich so weiter zu gehen
Würd' gerne wissen wie du's verstehst
Und ich folge deinen Wegen 
So als gingst du noch durch's Leben
Ich bleib in deinen Fußstapfen stehen
Würd' gerne in deine Augen sehen
Und ich frag' „Wo komme ich her?“
Du sagst „Ich weiß es nicht mehr“

To mess with your values,
And change wrong to right.

Brought on by fear.

The gaps are enormous, we stare from each side,
We were strangers for way too long.

Moves on reaction, then slumps in despair,
Trapped in a cage and surrendered too soon,

They don't rise up, just descend,
But I don't care anymore,
I've lost the will to want more,
I'm not afraid not at all,
I watch them all as they fall,
But I remember when we were young.

Those with habits of waste,
Their sense of style and good taste,
Of making sure you were right,
Hey don't you know you were right?
I'm not afraid anymore,
I keep my eyes on the door,
But I remember....

Tears of sadness for you,
More upheaval for you,
Reflects a moment in time,
A special moment in time,
Yeah we wasted our time,
We didn't really have time,
But we remember when we were young.

And all God's angels beware,
And all you judges beware,
Sons of chance, take good care,
For all the people not there,

They find it all, a different story,
Notice whom for wheels are turning,
Turn again and turn towards this time,
All she ask's the strength to hold me,
Then again the same old story,
Word will travel, oh so quickly,
Travel first and lean towards this time.

Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown,
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time,
Watching her, these things she said,
The times she cried,
Too frail to wake this time.

That point me to another day
A duel of personalities
That stretch all true realities

That keep calling me

Keep on calling me
They keep calling me

Where figures from the past stand tall
And mocking voices ring the halls
Imperialistic house of prayer
Conquistadors who took their share

Calling me, calling me

Joy Division,"Here are the young men, the weight on their shoulders,
Here are the young men, well where have they been?
We knocked on the doors of Hell's darker chamber,
Pushed to the limit, we dragged ourselves in,

Watched from the wings as the scenes were replaying,
We saw ourselves now as we never had seen.
Portrayal of the trauma and degeneration,
The sorrows we suffered and never were free.

Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?
Where have they been?

Weary inside, now our heart's lost forever,
Can't replace the fear, or the thrill of the chase,
Each ritual showed up the door for our wanderings,
Open then shut, then slammed in our face.

Painstaking devotion and love,
Surrendered to self preservation,
From others who care for themselves.
A blindness that touches perfection,

I'm doing the best that I can.
I'm ashamed of the things I've been put through,
I'm ashamed of the person I am.

These things I could never describe,
These pleasures a wayward distraction,
This is my one lucky prize.

Back out of my duties, when all's said and done,
I know that I'll lose every time.

Safety is sat by the fire,
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles,
Left with a mark on the door,

Forgive and forget's what they teach,
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more,
And watch as they drop by the beach.
