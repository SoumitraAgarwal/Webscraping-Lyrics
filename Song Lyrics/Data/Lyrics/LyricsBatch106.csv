Fat Joe,"Yeah, uh, yeah, Loyalty, haha
She was sixteen maybe seventeen, uh
Who you gonna trust?
And Life Goes On (2002)
The timin ain't me, it's like, please goin through wrong
Speak the truth, haha, speak the truth, yeah, yo, yo

She was only sixteen, when I met her I was playin' the corner
Had to scream one of her niggas, like get up off her
She was a diamond in the rough, real neighborhood jewel
You would never see her out, 'less she comin' from school
At first we started out like sisters and brothers
'Till we finally let it out, and started kissin' and huggin'
And your moms always dissin' me, tryin' to get rid a me
I guess she figured out, I had taken your virginity
She was right, sexin' all day
When they wouldn't let me in, we be playin' the hallway
Talkin' all day, bout the stupidest shit
Like if we got rich, what would we do with our chips?
And who was our favorite rappers, it was Nas at the time
We would memorize every single bar of his rhymes
Summertime, kids is playin' in the park
I might just ride by, let 'em sprinkle the truck
And Life Goes On

[Chorus]
She was sixteen, maybe seventeen
I was eighteen, nineteen maybe a little bit more
(was she a little more), ha ha
Yeah, huh, but life goes on
She was sixteen, maybe seventeen
I was eighteen, nineteen maybe a little bit more
Ha ha ha ha, yeah, yeah, woof, uh, yo
But life goes on

This shit got deeper, you was havin' my seed
I couldn't wait to see this little nigga look like me
Sure enough a little fat guy named D'Ryan
Kept us up all night, always bitchin' and cryin'
I was still slingin' fast, the ""Flow Joe"" came out
Things changed, wasn't the same, wanted to hang out
The groupies was chasin' me, rudely awakened me
No longer safe for me, this new world is takin' me
You deserve much more than to be mistreated
I was a fucked up nigga, but at least I admit it
Just to be cool, I helped you through school
So you can have your own career, and don't depend on no fool
Life seems crazy when you look back
I pray to God, that you hook up with a good cat
We can't look at, who's right or who's wrong
But I thought I'd let you know through this song
That Life Goes On

[Chorus]

So I moved on to the next phase a my life
I finally met the women I would make my wife
It was love at the first sight, in the worst way
Shorty kept holdin' out, had me thirsty, mercy
Mi shari amor, whisper in my ear
Tell me baby girl is it me that you adore
Used to stay up all night, just bumpin' and grindin'
Makin' plans for the future, how to hustle my rhyme in
Used to drive cross state for like a G a show
A well known famous rapper, but my pocket's is broke
But we kept grindin'
Slowly but surely, kept climbin'
Pun broke in the doors, now we headlinin'
I'm lettin everybody know your my sweetest possession
How you kept me real strong through the deepest depression
Paid no mind to your friends, cause their words is trife
I hold you down for the rest of your life
Cause Life Goes On

[Chorus: x4]

Look just shut the fuck up, Joe told us what happened

Told us what, what happened
You're trying to act like you don't know what's going on, but I know
You know what happened that night

I was drinking Cristal on the right hand side (yeah)
Hennessey on the left hand side
Macho gave it to me, I don't remember after that so, aw

You think your a tough guy right (tough guy)
Your not, your a pussy, cause your afraid if you rat on Fat Joe

Aw, sorry, sorry, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

Maybe we should put him in a cell and lock him up, until he fucking talks

Rat on Fat Joe, what do you mean?
There is no rat on Fat Joe, you disrespect him right now, that's not good

Your fucking busted man, just tell us this shit
Your fucking baby momma told us

Fuck it, listen to me, I don't snitch, I'm twistin alright
I'm fuckin' TS Member, Terror Squad, Loyalty",Life Goes On
Fat Joe,"[Intro - Fat Joe talking]
Cool & Dre, uh
Terror Squad motherfuckers
They're all gonna laugh at ya, haha
They're all gonna laugh at ya
Yeah, (YO), uh, (oh God), haha
Haha (feedin you, feedin you)
Yo (feedin you, feedin you)

[Fat Joe]
Yo, uh, yo, call me the JV artist
That means I own two joint ventures and two different labels, niggas that pay me homage
Been in this game for nine seasons
That's nine reasons why I'm expired the rhyme beefin
Ya'll niggas is rappin ass backwards
I left twenty spots since beginnin this rap shit
All yo papi lo que pasa contigo
Mad cause I'm the only nigga reppin our people
When I came in this game, no one wanted the job
All of a sudden niggas actin like they wanna go hard
Spittin venom 'bout the Squad, try and shittin the God
This ain't no ""Scarface"" shit, blow up your kids in the car
And since you wanna act like you livin a movie
I'll hit you with more shots than Bruce Lee got in a ""Fist of Fury""
Bitch niggas, nothin but snitch niggas
Today you on my dick, tomorrow you on his nigga
Got deported from the Squad, can't afford another car
Where's your house at? I heard your livin with your moms (livin with your moms)
Blane nigga better stay in your place
Keep talkin, burst a flame in your face, motherfucker

[Armageddon]
Yo, yo, with this comparison the Geddy is God
Cause even though you never seen me, I been put fear in your hearts
And I'm smooth like a Mulo it theme
Skip bullets of your Coogi beam
Before you knew you were seen
Yeah I'm nice and I don't care if you know
Cause all you really need to understand is how hard I'm rulin with Joe
And the streets is no place for late bloomers
Just gangsta niggas, snakes and bitches that meant to spread rumors
Listen, I'm from the Bronx were the gun shoot rabid
Front if you want, but don't think we don't shoot rapids
I'm what some might consider a ghost
Cause I move at night, plus I'm the type to play a live nigga close
I'm the ultimate, high consulted, rhyme vocalist
I write dope, spit dust and shit cocoa bricks
This is what you dicks need to act-knowledge
Or get the shit smacked outta ya fat cabbage
Don't ask why we act violent
We just killas and thugs
Niggas wit mad talent, that still dabble in drugs
I only rap now to speak to the streets
They say the Squad gotta feed 'em the beef
So we gonna feed 'em the beef

[Prospect]
My nine milly blaze, and hit hard like Willy Mays
Since my kiddy days, grew up with thugs who were really crazed
Ain't no silly games, right here be the truth
150 proof, whoever, I'm talkin to you
They call me Prospect, I'm one in a mil
One of the real, I rap but I still put a gun in your grill
I'm the reason why I catch you when your car breezin by, with your Iceberg team
You look when the light turns green
Your scared to death, don't make me have to air at ya chest
Or tear ya flesh, for actin like I carin what's left
Anyone can get it in a minute give it some time, I'm livin this rhyme
Let my nine get in your spine, sit and recline
Get so mad, forget and rewind
So I can see what I did again and just slide
To the next level, hop on the bike and just pedal
Bustin at your best rebel, who runnin to test medal
Let me get settled, lay my mom down in this game
For niggas kinda refain, I push 'em down in the train
Bout it the same, my three cousins up in the Benz
Big, G Psycho and E, ya'll know what this is

[Remy Martin]
Yo, yo, It's the T, E, a are a, a are a, O, are Squad
So you know I gotta be that bitch Remy Mar
With Armageddon and your nigga Joe The God
Tony Sunshine and motherfuckin Prospect
Straight out the projects
A forest, where they kill for mils and they blast the steel
But I'm from murda murda Castle Hill
I got a big ass burner, but I'll slash your grill
Yo don't got no status, don't want no static
They knew you was loco toto, and I don't no Spanish
All I know is how to cock back and aim for the cabbage
And keep on bustin 'til the bitch brain splatter
And the kids won't matter, when the crib's on fire
What you spit don't matter, cause this bitch on fire
And I won't stop rockin 'til I retire
Any bitch disagree is a god damn liar

[Outro - Fat Joe talking]
Yeah, uh infamous Terror Squad nigga
Loyalty, what does it mean to you
How many a ya'll niggas is loyal?
All these Benedict Arnold niggas
Switch sidin niggas, ya heard?
Nigga I throw this whole rap shit out the window in a sec, ya heard?
Joe Crack the Don Diggler
The savior, Caesar, the streets is mine nigga

Terror Squad baby, BX boro, holdin down to the death
It's nothin realer than this you heard, uh what huh

[Verse 1]
Its like I'm always out to prove somethin
Everytime I stop on the block
I set up shop and try to move somethin
And I'm talkin about kilo's and pounds
Fuck a desert eagle
I got shit that spit over 300 rounds
Can tell by the scar on my neck
I spar with the best
Joey boombay-ay, hit hard with the left
Sharp with the right, I don't know why I bother
Y'all not retarded
Man ya know what the squadron is like
And he can get it too
But I let him die slow death I probably just collectin his food
I'm deadin ya crew
To tell ya the truth we not stoppin
I'm like lil' lease from be	-street man I keep poppin
The streets knockin my shit, the d's watchin my shift
We can do this however, east glock or the fifth
I leave you chumps to frame, right where you standin
Daughter slaughtered and maimed you should have paid the ransom

[chorus x2]
Its the T E are are O are squad, nigga get it right
Its the nigga joe the don
And the kid flow hard, ask the clique
Niggas be like you crazy, he got classic shit

[Verse 2]
Its the killa kid from the bronx
Holdin down to the death
You can hear the squad comin
By the sound of the techs
A hundred rounds in a sec
Leave you on front page
You would think I was down with the ROC
The way I just blazed
I puff haze to keep my mind at ease
Can't wait for the day to see shyne released
This hip hop shit is unjust, who you gon' trust
When most of these record label execs is dumb fucks
I keep a gun tuck under my belly
Only nigga on the island makin calls from the celly
We watchin belly on the DV, 60 inch TV
Flat shit attatch to the back of the CP
This game need me, I'm like gotti once I'm gone
All you gonna have left is a bunch of fake dons
Champagne with the women, run a game for the puddin
Its all the same, still runnin trains with my hoodmen
A bunch of goodmen, but don't get it confused
We like dinero in heat nigga, nothin to loose
I know you seen the shoot out scene
Don't make us reneact, 'cause I rather be laid up in ?? with a featured actress

[chorus x2]

Its the T E are are O are squad, nigga get it right
Its the nigga joe the don
And the kid flow hard, ask the clique
Niggas be like you crazy, he got classic shit

Yea, hell yea, uh brought to you by the realest motherfuckers in this game
The infamous terror squad, yea, real niggas, real dons
Real G's haha, come on, woo uh
Ton' Montana rest in peace forever, never forget.. Big Pun!",Prove Something
Fat Joe,"Slow motion, baby
Tell you what I see through these eyes
All we do is speak the truth, yeah
Shit is realla then real, yeah
Shit is realla then real, ain't it?

My true niggas walk wit me, yeah
They ride wit me
Would you cook pies wit me now, ya heard?

Lord, I keep hollerin', I hope You listenin'
How come I'm still stressed an' even though the squad's glistenin'?
Why You had to take Pun, someone so young?
Had so much more to live for, as real as they come

Dead man can't talk
That's why You're hearin' one side of the story
But did they tell You how he provided for forty?
Family members, grandmas to shorties
Even my seeds ate off the big homie

How could You deceive Your kids like that
Make 'em believe they dad wasn't worth jack?
Listen to the facts as The Don pours his heart on this track
How could I just stand there an' not react?

An' I'm just about sick of all you sideline niggas
You know, do anythin' for the limelight niggas
I'm defendin' your honor, my brother from anotha Momma
I never thought I'd see the day they tried to send you [Incomprehensible]

Shit is realla then you think, man, you must not know
It takes a lot to walk a day in the life of Fat Joe
The place I'm from, MTV don't wanna film
Just a simple dice game will get a muthafucka killed

The ghetto ain't a place that you wanna take lightly
Same cat that'll spill you an' end up with your wifey
I've seen it all, that's why I've picked up the pen
To keep your boy from servin' life in the pen, ya heard?

Fuck the flu season, nowadays it's sue season
Can't even go to the clubs an' show my people love
'Coz soon as shit pop off an' niggas knuckle love
Niggas accusin' me of fuckin' 'em up

I'm like, ""Hold up, ain't they supposed to be dogs?""
Part time live niggas, dabbelin' drugs
See a rapper think of a lucrative deal
But you'se a bitch if you choosin' to squeal

It's more than obvious, you don't know a thing about honor
But what goes around comes around, you'll soon learn about karma
As for me I stay being the realest
Admired by politicians, street thugs an' killers

I keep feedin' the street but the street feed back
Is that police tryna see Joe back in green slacks?
But never dat, see, I keep long money
An' if you lookin' for dat
You'll never see a cent from me, muthafucker

Shit is realla then you think, man, you must not know
It takes a lot to walk a day in the life of Fat Joe
The place I'm from, MTV don't wanna film
Just a simple dice game will get a muthafucka killed

The ghetto ain't a place that you wanna take lightly
Same cat that'll spill you an' end up with your wifey
I've seen it all, that's why I've picked up the pen
To keep your boy from servin' life in the pen, ya heard?

Yo, I stay grindin', everybody counted me out
Now I'm rewindin' in my summer beach house
If I'm not in the studio, I'm out on tour
Bustin' my ass to make my fans' future secure

Nowadays everybody want somethin' for nothin'
All of a sudden niggas talkin' like, ""Joey be frontin'""
The hood screamin', “Crack done changed, he don't holla”
I know now Big, 'Mo Money Mo Problems'

Jealousy's a muthafucka
Who'd a thought the same niggas you be feedin'
Be the muthafuckaz comin' for ya?
I'm not stressin', I was born a warrior
Plus I'm too big, too wise, too strong for ya

When it's all said an' done, I follow my dreams
Could have ended up dead or in jail given the scheme of things
To let you know I'm the reason you still walkin'
If I said somethin' it was me, not the liquor talkin', muthafucka

Shit is realla then you think, man, you must not know
It takes a lot to walk a day in the life of Fat Joe
The place I'm from, MTV don't wanna film
Just a simple dice game will get a muthafucka killed

The ghetto ain't a place that you wanna take lightly
Same cat that'll spill you an' end up with your wifey
I've seen it all, that's why I've picked up the pen
To keep your boy from servin' life in the pen, ya heard?

","Shit Is Real, Pt. III"
Fat Joe,"Whoo.. friendly day in the neighborhood
Birds is chirpin (Hi neighbor!)
Niggas walkin they dogs, ha ha, watering they flowers
That's my neighborhood.. FUCK NO!

Raul ya heard me?
Macho, Jigga Brown JD, Charlie Rock LD, Remy Ma, unh
Sound boy turn this shit up right here

I'm your idol, your highest title, numero uno
Yes I'm Puerto Rican and I speak it so that you know
Stomp.. yeah that's the idea
Leave that nigga leakin from ear ta ear
Listen here young bruh, man ya end is near
They probably, find your body at the end of the pier
Niggas must be crazy to mistakin me for folk lore
I put the eighty to your baby man I told y'all
Fuckin wit crack's like fuckin wit Crack
What? Pull out the pipe or push your weight back
Look, ya hate that, look we stay straped
From Crook from way back done took the game back
Ya shook, remain fact top of the world, stop knockin the girl
She in the drop with already rock lock and the pearl
Fish Scale ta Heron, live well from here on
Half a mil in ya grill, of course we bare all
Niggas thinkin that rap is just words
I pull up in they curb, pull a Desert Bird
And clear the block in no time
Get off my dick, stop focus shit and get cha own shine, muhh'fucka

Take a look at my life, and you can see that
I'm from the Bronx where it's known to hear the heat clap
Y'all need a nigga like me to point cha fingers at
So stop hating on The Don, you know ya need Crack
Take a look at my life, and you can see that
I'm from the Bronx where it's known to hear the heat clap
Y'all need a nigga like me to point cha fingers at
So stop hating on The Don, you know ya need Crack

First we was thuggin, then bust sluggin
My Lifestyle the shit, really had the streets buggin
Oh no he ain't come back like that
Not Crack with a platinum plaque, yo!
It's the thirteenth al spinna
Niggas use to doubt now we even made Craig Common look like a winner
Me and Diddy skippin out on bills
Just copped the house on a hill, now how that feel?
Fuck, a lot of y'all niggas, you been shittin since the first song
Now we rip it down spring break with no shirt on
Ass all out, just swoonin the crowd
Same damn mean bitches wanna move in my house
You see us back to back in 'em snow white trucks
Chain hanging off the rim, you not giving a fuck
You must not be reading it right
Ice so bright, we don't need headlights at night
Yo, crack niggas, ask niggas how I smack niggas
With the mac flast 'cause I am what I rap, nigga
TS throw in your hands, make 'em pack nigga
To never let another crew move his back nigga, what!

Take a look at my life, and you can see that
I'm from the Bronx where it's known to hear the heat clap
Y'all need a nigga like me to point cha fingers at
So stop hating on The Don, you know ya need Crack
Take a look at my life, and you can see that

Maybe its the TS chain (I got em right)
Maybe its that Escalade (Come get em right)
Maybe its the way I do (Keep mamies like)

All I know it that this chick
Is gon' leave wit me
Gon' creep wit me
Gon' freak wit me
Gon' leave wit me

I know it seems every song, is about like the same old thing
But when you rich, ain't nuthin' to do but fuckin' hang
Eat good, spend money, count chunks of change
Keep mah ladies lookin' good, when they touch the Range.
Never fuck wit a bitch, if she can't be trained
Never leave wit a chick, if she don't give brain.
We could leave on trip, I got a private plane
I don't fly, but we could park it up and blaze.
Joe's the God
And I know you need somethin' to praise
Just have a lil faith, and you could be saved.
Uh, it's not mah fualt if they love the kid
It might be the chain or the whip
I don't know what it is.

[Chorus]

Um, I don't mean no harm
But their ain't a chick sicka then Remy Ma
And all the hot boys wanna fuck wit Rem
And I don't turn em away
I'm like, I'm the bomb now.
Where's your gurl, don't matter to me
I'm way out of her league
She can't keep up to mah speed.
She's weak, she don't need to smoke weed
And wherever she's at
Is where she should be.
Now, where's your wife, I don't care
I'll be at the crib, when she ain't there.
Baby do mah nails, and lace mah hair
Take me out on trips and pay the fare.
Maybe.

[Chorus]

Damn, look at all the rocks he got
Ferrari drop 360,hard to top
The party's hot,all white linen affair
I'm doin the suit thang, white Nike Airs.
I'm in the middle of the crowd, like the Don is here.
Shorty whistlin in mah ear
Told me what she wanna hear,she said
""We thuggin'
Smokin' on sumthin'
Down to leave wit ya'll, As long as ya'll fuckin'.""
Woo, thas how you do that there
See me wit mah boys, bring ya crew bak here
We ridin',she drivin'
On our way to the crib, long fish arrivin'.

Maybe its the TS chain (I got em right)
Maybe its that Escalade (Come get em right)
Maybe its the way I do (Keep mamies like)

Crouched up over in a humble position
Praying hard oh my god if he only would listen
Somos poco pero locos my trienta ocho a leave you roto
The side of your face the size of a plate
For hiding the weight you just should of give it
My squad bring horror to rap like Wes Craven
Any track I spitted on, I shitted on
Anybody disagree'n with that we could get it on
Keep a fitted on to match the rest of my clothing
Got a ill with just the leapardcan showing
And he got a pipe in his mouth that's how
Like to see the fiend with a pipe in they mouth (nigga)
If my bitch a disrespect shot light in the couch
Best believe I'm a squeeze this freaking pipe in his mouth
I'm the kid that they yapping about they just won't stop

Arms is missing
Everything we seek is the truth far from fiction
Hope why'all not far from listening
Game over up north style pillowcase full of soda
I warned why'all ah
And I usually don't do that
I usually put the tool were your tooth at
And introduced you to Jesus to the chrome
Three seconds after that is a rap for your dome
And I hate to paint a picture so perfect
Believe me dog is just for calling the act makes me nervous
My soul purpose is to rep for real
My no Camazari niggas having the death of mills
You slept on Crillz now the kids backs
With the fourth fifth griz gat
Leave your vision pitched black

I don't give a fuc* about your faults or mishappens nigga 
We from the Bronx, New York, shit happens 
Kids clappin, love to spark the place 
Half the niggaz in the squad got a scar on their face 
It's a cold world and this is ice 
Half a mill for the charm, nigga this is life 
Got the Phantom in front of the buildin, Trinity Ave 
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad 
As a young'n - was too much to cope with 
Why you think ? mu'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit Shoulda been called Armed Robbery 
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny 
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle 
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was 'gon bubble 
Came out the gate on some Flow Joe shit 
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo kid! 

[Chorus: Fat Joe] 
Said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants 
And do the rockaway, 
now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back 
I said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants 
And do the rockaway, 
now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back 
(Come on!) 

[Verse 2: Remy Martin] 
are to the Eazy, M to the Wizzi 
My arms stay breezy, the Don stay fizzi 
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-40-fizzive 
And I just bought a bike so I can ride till I die 
With a matchin jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion 
My niggaz in the club, but you know they not dancin 
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance with boogies 
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies 
Listen we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us 
And we - walk around the metal detectors 
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section 
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it 
Said he - liked my necklace, started relaxin 
Now that's what the fuc* I call a chain reaction 
See ""Money Ain't a Thing"" nigga, we still the same niggaz 
Flows just changed now we bout to change the game nigga 

[Repeat Chorus] 

[Verse 3: Fat Joe] 
Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now 
And that G4 can fly through any weather now 
See, niggaz get tight when you worth some millions 
This is why I sport the chinchilla to hurt they feelings 
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit 
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit 
If Five-o boy come, then they'd proudly squeal 
Cause half these rappers they Blow like Derek Pharrell 
If you cross the line, damn right I'm 'gon hurt ya 
These faggot niggaz even made gang signs commercial 
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin it up 
B2K crip walkin like that's what's up! 
Kay keep tellin me to speak about the Rucker 
Matter of fact, I don't want to speak about the Rucker 
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this 
My niggaz didn't have to play to win the championship, come on! 

[Repeat Chorus] 

[Outro: Fat Joe] 
Ha! ha! yeah! (Can you hear me?!) 
Bronx, BX borough, Terror Squad, uh (Ha!)

Uh! Yeah! Streets is ours, come on 
Nah man, it ain't never gon stop

Go figure it, Joe Crack runnin New York
Who woulda thunk it, God above and Pun did
Yeah, they came while I was 'sleep
Whispered in my ear this is your year {CRACK PREACH!}
So I testify
To burn down the throne, niggaz follow my lead
Save your breath for crownin me King of N.Y.
I'm the one and only Godfather, one through three
Pardon me, but I was raised in the projects
Forgettin I wasn't the only object
We was more concerned with cuttin up and choppin
Supplyin fiends with that work, get it poppin
Now who wanna pop off 'til they head get popped off
By the realest MC, and that's ME!
Joe Crack the Don, I came from the streets
Knee deep in the game, other half in the streets
I got that permit to bury ya ice grill
Shoulda named this album hurr ""Licensed to Kill""
Ahhh - yes my life chilly chill
Mansion in Miami, other in the Jersey Hills
Chillll, that's that '88 flow
Small face 20's, that's that '88 dough
Joey Jefferson, I'm on the 88th flo'
Khaled him with that talk nigga {UN, UN, UN, UNBELIEVABLE!}

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
One Phantom, two castles, and a Jeep fo'
Five mics a classic, kinda like my six-fo'
Several years I earned cake, let me tell you more
Joey Crack, a.k.a. '88, Cook Coke

[Fat Joe]
Wonder why I paint a picture of the street life so vivid I lived it
Y'all dudes innocent, y'all just visitin
And that's the reason why they call me ghetto
D.O., have you homeless {?} diggin deep holes
Police know, but just couldn't figure me out
I'm like {?}, have 'em makin pies in the house
It's grill, spit fire like I never been out
And I ain't gon' retire 'til there's never a doubt
The wheels, in my head keep spinnin
I'm thinkin anybody go against me losin chil'ren
I'm thinkin there's no better time than now to start some killin
It's Cook Coke Crack, 2005's ghetto version of Achilles NIGGA

[Chorus]

[Fat Joe]
Yo, yo, loop this and you crash the remix
And forget who you thought I was, I'm Crack BEYOTCH
The same dude that made you ""Lean Back""
And had that nigga Ma$e spittin that gangsta shit
Can't wait 'til my nigga Shyne come home
Six minutes, six minutes, Joey Crack you're on
Uh-um, uh-um, is my microphone on? Yes
New York, look I brought the championship home
Now, through up your peace signs to the sky
For all our soldiers that died
That means Biggie Smalls, Tupac, Big L and Left Eye
And Big Pun the greatest of all time, sing it with me now

[Chorus]

[repeat 2X]
Wonder if we all V-S'es'us

King of Harlem ain't nobody made me leave
Who else could take 5 years off
Cold turkey come back and fly lears off
Cats front leave them leaning like Smirnoff
If haters wanna hate then its their loss
Come up in the Rucker with all my Jake's on
Car grills so big you can cook a steak on
People hear Ma$e call em' wanna get their mase on
You hot 16 I'm a very great song
Been beating on the DJ before the Ma$e song
You play Clake Kent you better have your cape on
Plenty homes mansion many rooms

You don't want no problems with the boogie down Bronkster
You don't want no drama with the blond bomber
Original don dotta of the blond bottle
The model from white America
Then Joe the spokesperson for the Latino
Then we got Ma$e back to represent everything else in between including the
Percentages of the press we don't
The best from each coast
The midwest to the dirty dirty
Even further to Miami
All the way back to Californ-I-a
It would probably be best right now if I warned Dre to get on the horn and
Tell him about the storm coming all our way
So tell him pack grab a gat right now get on the floor I'll wait
Shake that ass a little more my way
But baby I don't dance not that I can't there's a pistol in my pants

Said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants

Fat Joe,"I don't give a fuck about your faults or mishappens nigga
We from the Bronx, New York, shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mill for the charm, nigga this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a young'n, was too much to cope with
Why you think mu'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit
Shoulda been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was 'gon bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty with the logo kid!

Said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-4-fizzive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride till I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance with boogies
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we, walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See Money Ain't a Thing nigga, we still the same niggas
Flows just changed now we bout to change the game nigga

Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come, then they'd proudly squeal
Cause half these rappers they Blow like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm 'gon hurt ya
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up!
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about the Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the Rucker

Your (Monologue's) getting tired, now it's time to ride
You're print distrified, you're no longer desired
So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire
I'm on fire, holly dipped in octane
Let east coast bang, let west coast bang
And Rule gonna bring the ghetto gospel
To every hood possible, pushin' through in the sky blue
Back with the gods you now, preferably the 4 pound
Slugs flyin' at the speed of sound
Tryin' to catch the ears of niggas that's runnin' their mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the runnin's about
But we're hunters, we take pride in airin' our prey out
Leavin 'em laid out, dead, in just a sport
Cause we ain't playin' up here in New York

Nigga I can see the coke in your nose
This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe
And I was just about to find god
But now that Ma$e is back, I think I'd much rather find a menage
And everybody talkin' crazy how they're AK spit
But we know this investigatin', and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth homie, got the industry shook like
""Naw nigga, Joe gonna let 'em loose on me""
True Story, I'm bringin' the T back
Even Roy Jones was forced to (Lean Back)
My nigga Dre said grind cook
Now we killin' them Howard niggas, who said I must of found Pun's rhyme book
Got bitches on top of the Phantom
And the pinky got bling, like the ring around Saturn
Cook coke, crack, niggas fiend for that
And you already know the x is where the team be at

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I swear it couldn't be sweeter, Life's a bitch
Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich
It's guaranteed you gonna die, you might get missed
For maybe 2 or 3 hours, 'til they light their spliffs
And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken
And you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold a title, because I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids, hoppin' out with them old rifles
Just doin' shit for nothin', it's so spiteful
Ha I'm just like you
Word that niggas want to murk you is in the air
A double shot of yak and the purple is in the air
And I'm not cocky, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment

I know you heated, wish you was here but, gotta go now have a good evening
Hang up the phone now, have a good weekend

You did whatever it took to keep the supper hot
And I remember when you worked at the number spot
Once the cops caught you I skipped school

Then you bathed him and tucked him to sleep
Yeah I knew from that day life wouldn't be sweet
He got in trouble with the law
Then you bailed him out

Same day I got signed you was diagnosed with Cancer
Doctor said it'd be a miracle if you survived
Then you looked in my eyes and said
Joey I don't want to die
I pray to god that he show us a sign
Now its fourteen years later and you still alive
Thank you God

[Chorus]

[3rd Verse]
God I thank you so much
My Mother has so much to see
So much to do
She's had such a painful life
Many nights I argue with you in my prayers but I know you're the boss
You kept her alive for a reason
Mama I'm a ride for you
I swear
Yo, I bet you proud of your son
He's a rap star now
Took you out of them projects and bought you that house
Got you that housekeeper to manicure the grounds
And I bought you that car that breaks the barrier of sound
You take care of Joey and I love you for that
And you raising John John and we love you for that
I guess Lisa was an Angel
God wanted her back
Damn I really miss my sister
Guess she's better where she's at
Mammy I love you
I want the world to know I love you
And every chance I get I'm a kiss you and hug you
Life wasn't easy everyday is a struggle
But like my niggaz from Chi town say
It's all bubbles

[Chorus]

Hoping my real mo'fuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote

It's that shit right here
Took me like ten years to do

You know I cried doing this song
Man, so much pain
Mami you such a good woman
You a classy woman
I know you a private person
You don't want the world to know all your business
But I had to let them know how strong you are
I love you so much

This song is also dedicated to little Maria
One of my best friends on earth
Get your shit together girl I love you too
Juju what's up, you my nephew I love you for life

It's Crack bitch",Bendicion Mami
Fat Joe,"Nigga every time you see man
You know you want to be me
Ain't you can't deny the fact that this fat niggas fly
Went from Sergio to Kenny
To moving them Lamborghini's
Got you sick to your stomach
Now you ask yourself why
Nigga, Crack was the first
You seem em in red monkeys
And I bet you didn't k now that they came in my size
Now its highly controversial if you find me in commercial
And you know that G five's the only way that we fly
Now I'm feeling like Pharrell and Snoop
The world beautiful
Brazilian, Colombian chicks
You know the usual
Them niggas over there please send them some bottles
Cause they lookin' like some haters
I don't really need the problems
Cause these niggas here
We love to give ketchup
We bloody up the whole damn room
If you let us
And I ain't tryin' to steal
I'm just tryin' to chill
And like up this Kush with this hundred dollar bill
Nigga

[Chorus]
Jealousy
Nigga, You's a grown man
Why you get so jealous
Why you take the stand

Jealousy
Why you mad at my bitch
Cause she wear fly shit
And she push nice whips

Jealousy
I don't owe you man
I don't know you man
I never sold you man

Jealousy
Jealousy
Jealousy

All these niggas jealous
Please don't be mad
Don't talk to them boys
Bring up my past
Don't tell em bout the Macks that I stashed in the grass
And that ten mill terror squad
Start up cash
I'm a law abiding citizen
I barely smoke blunts, now
We into real estate
We fuckin' with Donald Trump now
When you know who
Told them boys what
I been rappin' for years all of a sudden I'm hot
Cause the only time you see me is probably when I'm on TV
Smokin' the cohiba on the deck of my yacht
Nigga you could never be me, though I make it seem easy
Only Nigga from the Bronx
Though Miami's my block
Now you got us fucked up
Nigga we don't rat
We don't talk to them boy's
All we do it clap
All we do is spill cry's
Got that on tap
Look at all the shit I accomplished
Not bad for Crack

[Chorus]

I'm feeling like Christ at the tabernacle
Stones are thrown at me
Record labels is hiding
Nigga's disowning Joey
And still I throw rocks at tanks
The poor peoples champ
Go against locks with shanks
Yeah I walk the middle of the streets with no body guards
Stick up kid salute the hard body god
My jail niggas they love this shit
Yeah they sharpen up they shanks while they bumpin' this shit
And my niggas on the table
Yeah they listen to this
Little Coca
Little soda
Yeah they whipping up shit
And I know it sounds eerie but my niggas better hear me
If you speaking on the phones it won't be secret to the jury
They hit you wit that Rico
I'm not meaning PR
I'm talking full scale riots
Whole lot of triage
And I know you not scared but please be cautious
Cause these jealous ass niggas could be walking amongst us

[Chorus]

To my jail niggaz
To your street memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record we love you
We miss you",Jealousy
Fat Joe,"Yeah, uh
I don't give a fuck, fuck you
Fuck you rappers, fuck the industry
Fuck anybody who don't fuck with me, crack!
Ha ha ha, this is the Pendemic

We getting poppin', them hammers go
The spanish bro, (Crucial Conflict), I'm (Do or Die) with the flow
Joe Peschi in Casino, ya know
Poked him 40 times, hit him once more for the road
Yeah, I'm being honest your honor, I killed a man
But he was a fucking problem your honor
They say Joey's a killer, every time body shit
Every verse iller, ain't nobody hot as this
You know me, I'm a one man army
Even though millions'll follow just like Gandhi
I'm Malcolm, shit I bring it out 'em
Body on Broadway, now nobody can doubt him
Must I be a backpacker or Black Eye Pea
Or spit conscience shit just to win a Grammy?
Nah, they gonna listen to me
All of Big Pun is flowing through me
Yeah, Biggie Smalls is rolling with me
I'm way over your head, you like cre-a-tiv-ity
I'm a gangsta rapper, Lord forgive the shit I'm saying
But you'd be surprised where my music is playing
That's what they want to hear
Joey from the Bronx, I'm a pistoleer
I keep gunning for 'em, they keep running from me
I'm about my money give a fuck, I'm living comfortably
Yeah, I'm right here, middle of the ghetto
Sweatpants saggin' cause I'm packing heavy metal
Yeah I made the switch from clear tops to yellow
Mami yelling out the Window *spanish dialogue*
I hate the nigga, he makes me sick man, look at him
Soon as I get enough I'ma cuff 'em and throw the book at him
He ain't get all this shit from that fucking rap money
And every time we stop him, he thinks something's funny
Shit, heard he sells cracks on the block caught a body
Listen to his raps, he calls himself John Gotti
Officer, officer, please don't be bias
Don't you know all of us rappers are great liars?
We like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate
Sensationalize bring packs 'cross state
And y'all niggas lying cause young nigga dying
Over in Iraq, yeah families are crying
Controversy like oil for food
Worldwide Pendemic now we got the bird flu
Africa's in crisis, please give aid
Must we do everything like organize for our age
Katrina, Katrina, oh Ms. Katrina
I'm looking for some benefits, tell me have you seen her

Yeah, this is the Pendemic

Fat Joe,"Yeah, it's like that certain swagger of one's self
That BS music, that TS music, let's cook

Let me talk to these ***, I fought with these ***
Been in court for these ***, these is my ***
I never once count the chart figures
Never blamed y'all when s*** came up missin'

Naw, plus you'se a live wire
Caught beef over you *** in Elmira
Stood next to y'all while you was on fire
*** tried to kill us everyday but we some riders

Right, where did we go wrong?
You stayed in the streets, I switched to rap songs
You blazin' your heat, I'm reppin' the Bronx
Got caught in the sweep, I'm payin' your bond

I'd a done it ten times
Next thing I know I hear you talkin' outta line
Like, this ain't love, this is extortion
Joey know better, I put 'em in a coffin

I had to take a deep breath
*** about to get real crazy in the X
Man, I have them run up on ya
I'll wait a couple years, you'll be on that same corner

It's kinda hard not to kill ***
Like a full time job not to kill ***
Oh yeah, *** is realer then you think
For my respect, I do years in the bin

It's kinda hard not to kill ***
Like a full time job not to kill ***
Oh yeah, *** is realer then you think
For my respect, I do years in the bin

Been in the game for the minute, I'm makin' moves
I switch careers, I make them movies
Got TV shows that's reppin' the Bronx
I'm spittin' the Spanish, I'm viva Reggaeton

Oh yeah, I'm ready for war
Any body, hard body, just my 44
I mean Crack's that ***, I'll smack that ***
I'll yap that ***, gun clap that ***

Oh yeah, I spit that ***
Motivate young *** how to flip them ***
Showed you how to dump off and toss the ***
And this all the muh'f*** thanks I get

I'm married to this rap *** but the streets my life
Matter of fact, I take your life
Run up on your crib, *** your wife

Fat Joe,"You know one man's treasure is another man's cash
Speak on it, speak on it, listen
And you know the man that sleeps on the floor
Can't fall the *** off the bed
Pop your collar to this, it's grills mania, ya heard me?

She's my mami, she's my baby
I love you so much, you drivin' me crazy
Wanna be down? Jump in the car
Rollin' wit me, I'll make you a star

Now she was only sixteen, I had to nurture that
Give her some growth, waited 'til I touched the cat
Told she goin' have to work if she gon' get ahead
Then she drove me berserk when she gave me some ***

She told me that she learnt that from the porno flicks
I said, ?Mami, stop talkin', just suck on this ***?
I ain't say her name yet, so let's say she nothin'
Now watch me turn this nothin' into somethin', get it?

Mami, get in that kitchen, this is free base
Just cook it 'til it's hard, then cut it in eighths
Take the trip cross town to see Tru
Just get the money, don't listen, that *** think he cute

See all this money we got, we goin' shoppin'
Louis Vitton and Pucci, we get it poppin'
We hit the club on some clico s***
See the respect that you get from just bein' my ***

Look, see 'em, they sick, they wan' be in your shoes
That's the game that I hit her wit to leave her confused
I'm just usin' her for paper, she want a man
I'm 'bout to see my other *** but she understands

'Cause she's my mami, she's my baby
I love you so much, you drivin' me crazy
Wanna be down? Jump in the car
Rollin' wit me, I'll make you a star

She's my mami, she's my baby
I love you so much, you drivin' me crazy
Wanna be down? Jump in the car
Rollin' wit me, I'll make you a star

Ay yo, I met her at the Rucker Park watchin' the stars play
I knew she was a Terror, she was watchin' the Squad play
I knew she had her own, she was pushin' the bubble X
Type of eye candy that you see in a double X

Fat ***, long hair, short like Nia Long
I knew she was a victim from the start, my G is strong
And then she said she ain't felt this good in ten summers
Gave me credit cards and debit cards with pin numbers

I'm lookin' at receipts, she spent G's on the kid
I'm pushin' her V, even got keys to the crib
I needed to bag up, I bought G's to the crib
I got knocked, what she did? Put up the deed to the crib

But now she got a new gig at Chase Manhattan
Look my *** is wit ma, let's make it happen
So I burst through the door 'bout a quarter to four
And told every nosy ***, 'Get the *** on the floor'

Then she opened up the bag and started to fill 'em all
Makin' sure that she left the marked money in the drawer
Told security, ?If you move this goin' be your last night
I'm workin' with this Mack 10, you workin' with a flashlight?

I'm walkin' backwards, nobody moved, word to mother
Tryin' not look 'cause I don't want to blow her cover
That's when this *** winks and blew a kiss at me
I don't believe this *** took all them risks for me

That's why she's my mami, she's my baby
I love you so much, you drivin' me crazy
Wanna be down? Jump in the car
Rollin' wit me, I'll make you a star

She's my mami, she's my baby
I love you so much, you drivin' me crazy
Wanna be down? Jump in the car
Rollin' wit me, I'll make you a star

And his rep kinda crazy, known for slingin' them Macks

Got a baby with Sandra, he named him K-Sacks
'Cause that's where he did his first bid way back
Now this nigga Sha' got like a memory lapse
Basically you give him work and he ain't payin' back

Now with some connects, you could away with that
But he must of fucked wit the wrong Columbian cats
Now these niggaz comin' strapped and they want they money back
And you can't tell the difference 'cause some of them look black

Now Sha on the block thinkin' life's a joke
And his mama just had a dream that he might get smoked
But he don't give a fuck, he been through the best wars
Knife to knife, the yard to the mess halls

And these niggaz here got somethin' else in mind
Like a hundred shots fired at a pretzel less spine
Uh huh, you guessed it, just a matter of time
Another soldier down, he got hit with a nine, dang

Ghost ride the whip like I'm from Oakland y'all
It's the crack man and he ain't got a shot, the don,
The wrist is Jacob earring chapard

Nice with the hands better with the banger

Keep an A.K when I battle probably throw a fake nigga parade. I'm known!
But who gives a fuck I don't care
Don't lead them let the welfare feed them
Niggas had me thinking that Joey is fucked up!

I say off the streets I'm a symphony, niggas want my sympathy presiding official remedy
Stay cleaned up on a preacher on a Sunday morning

King of New york, King of New York, but we don't ever see these niggas up in New York
Can anybody tell me where is San Tropez
All these so called killers try their best to dress gay
Everybody beefing it's the same old day
All these mix-tape rappers now want to claim king
Everybody saying they are bringing New York back
But we the only niggas you pitch back the back(crack!)
You hear the echo, son of a nesto I'll let the tec blow
You should feel sky plenty like pistol, fuck a phone call I barely got a whistle

[Chorus:]

Coka, there's no one harder
Get off your knees get a job at the Carter
Throw a banks and invite your friends
You guarantee to see a couple of ends
See I've been getting money since who knows when
These other niggas just all pretend
You've been bamboozled diz duzu say thugs
Love at Madison Square they givin' group hugs
Now let me take you to the streets of darkness
Where I keep your favorite M.C. underneath my armpit the bronze kid
I'm only speaking the truth
Shit, look what these streets
May cologilua do

Hoppin' over them gates, I could see your face

Fat Joe,"You know
What you gotta understand is that it's a drug
that affects the brain chemistry of the user
and it causes things like paranoia, euphoria, insomnia, loss of appetite
and this really insatiable craving for more cocaine
People who smoke crack, they get this immediate
and intense release of dopamin in the brain
and once those dopamin levels plummet after just a few minutes
the smoker feels compelled to take another hit
just to ease the feelings of depression and sadness

Good afternoon
We're reporting live in the streets of the Bronx today
chronicling a deadly epidemic sweeping the nation
A wave of violent crimes have been linked to chronic addiction
to and distribution of a drug called

They heat me up, I can see the top bubble waitin for me
Investigators sendin snitches for me
Sold out, lines around the block
Niggas waitin for a whiff of that base and that rock
Chicago Bulls fitted, they callin me red top
You can find me in Humboldt Park soon as it gets dark
Or even in the daylight, even though it ain't right
I'm outside the church preyin on some saved lives
Or sittin on a scale good enough to taste
I'm better than a protein shake to lose weight
Nigga, no doubt I'm the hardest in the game
It's the Rock, I ain't talkin Jay, Biggs and Dame
I'm talkin bling-bling, crack pipe and a collar
I make bums fight to wash cars for a dollar

a intense gun battle between police and known drug dealers

Almost lost my political connect with Mayor Barry
They mix me with embalming fluid, it's unreal
And Jada said he cooked me on a Foreman Grill
Turn a happy home into a stash house
They can smoke me all night until they pass out
I'm cool with pops and I'm cool with moms
But they don't know that we cool, me and you share a bond

I can tell just by the way you push it out and flaunt it you bad
Something like dirty Diana, body dope as heron
And the sex off the handle
Your ex couldn't beat it, I hit it like a Frito
And since I lost some weight you say I got a big ego
It's too strong, you said the drive stick
Well baby just peel off
Loving how it lasts long, Leave the sheets gushy
Fuck you with the mask on, Halloween pussy
Your body shivers and troubles with each and every stroke
Pussy wetter than ever, enough to sink a boat

Transported in foreign cars to larg estates

I'm a light some candles girl and then tie up your wrists
Then I'm licking chocolate right off your stomach

Don't you be holding back
Cause in the end girl you're gonna want another round, another round

Fat Joe,"I just like waking up
Right next to that thing
Gon' have to roll over go have another round

No won't be holding back
'Cause in the end you'll know I want another round
Another round
Another round
Another round, oh I know I want another round
Another round (A round a round)

I used to want you and her and her and her and you with her and her
And now you got me alone and me tonight
I'ma give you my all, all I want is you

Hair in a bun 'cause sometimes the hair just hides your beauty
Swear on my son, ain't too many things could hide your booty
Call me what you like, but bet I slide with cutie
Kenny name wasn't Bud, but he still ride with Rudy
And that's why we comfortable as a Huxtable
You been around since the Lunchables, girl I fucks with you
In the back of the truck with you, same fingers I chuck with two
I'm just playing with you, thinking bout staying with you
Not forever but at least until the A.M. with you
Still playing with it, but you like it raw
Might need a morning after, what we did the night before
Might go another round if you're trying to fight me more

I won't be holding back, my love
I won't be holding back
I won't be holding back, my love
No won't be holding back
'Cause in the end you'll know I want another round
Another round
Another round
Another round, oh I know I want another round
Another round (A round a round)

I used to want you and her and her and her and you with her and her
And now you got me alone and me tonight
I'ma give you my all, all I want is you

Cake cake cake cake cake, you know you love it
Icing like Nuvo with a touch of red velvet, look at you,
You a star, I'm a G, Joe the Don
Super thief, I go hard in these sheets, I'm a God, Lord,
Emilio Pucci leggings for good behavior
I wanna tear them shits off you like Hulkamania
Then dive up in the pussy, Superfly Snuka
Have you coming back to back, more sex to cook up
But ask the girl will I hit advance
She post it out picture perfect, Instagram
I hit home runs and drink last shots
She tore her ACL from all the backshots

I won't be holding back, my love
I won't be holding back
I won't be holding back, my love
No won't be holding back
'Cause in the end you'll know I want another round
Another round
Another round
Another round, oh I know I want another round
Another round (A round a round)

I used to want you and her and her and her and you with her and her
And now you got me alone and me tonight
I'ma give you my all, all I want is you

So she done came down
Double cup with ice, man, I think she got some drink from me
Ever since I came round
She say she feel wrong, 'cause her boyfriend listen to me
I don't give a damn bout it
That nigga, if he trip, I got a whole clique of killers with me
See, I'm the man now
Rolling 24's through the hood, women checking for me
Girl, I ain't playing 'round
Pull up to the crib, hope you wearing something special for me
And I'mma lay it down
Round one, two, and three for you and me

I won't be holding back, my love
I won't be holding back
I won't be holding back, my love
No won't be holding back
'Cause in the end you'll know I want another round
Another round
Another round
Another round, oh I know I want another round
Another round (A round a round)

She love women and she keeps it under covers yo
And I love women, so she brings them under covers, yo
Fight then we fuck again, I swear I really love her though
Don't wanna be a player, help her find another Joe
Just to prove I love her, I use rubbers on my other hoes
And if she ever find out it'd be another blow
And that only me that I'mma have to hit another store
Spend another knot, hit another lot
That's how you know if you are in love or not
Bought her moms a whip on Mother's Day
Now I gotta get her the same whip her mother got

I'm a prime example of keeping it too real
Had somebody asked me if I learned my lesson
Told him, ""Actually prison made me more aggressive
I still smack a chip quick, no questions
But now I leave my handprint so she don't get the wrong impression""

Fat Lady Sings,"This guitar won't kill your fascists
This guitar never killed anyone
This guitar is not as charming as a gun
This guitar is never sure
This guitar is scared of you
This guitar is looking for a son

[CHORUS]
But you
You think the world's a book to read
And all you see are happy ends
I need my means I need my doubts
I need my friends
I need guitar
This guitar has had its dreams and
This guitar it sometimes bleeds and
This guitar it needs a simple mind
Once this guitar thought it knew everything
Everything a guitar could do but now
This guitar is learning all the time
But you
You would not understand sublime
Not if I carved it on your arm
In letters of quicklime this is not show
This lives this breathes
This guitar is all I use
To drain away those guitar blues
Then this guitar makes its excuse
And leaves
This guitar blows hot and cold
This guitar needs truth to be told
This guitar it wants to change your life
You say this guitar touches you
But you know you touch this guitar too
And you know this guitar will survive
I need you
You must realize that there are stars beneath the skies above
And that this this is not peace this is not love
This is my heart
This is guitar",This Guitar
Fat Larry's Band,"Well, I've spent a lifetime lookin' for you;
singles bars and good time lovers were never true.
Playin' a fools game hopin' to win; 
and tellin' those sweet lies  and losin' again.
 
I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces
of what I'm dreamin' of.
 
Hopin' to find a friend and a lover;
I'll bless the day I discover 
another heart lookin' for love.
 
And I was alone then, no love in sight;
and I did ev'rything I could to get me though the night.
Don't know where it started or where it might end;
I turned to a stranger just like a friend.
 
I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces
of what I'm dreamin' of.
 
Hopin' to find a friend and a lover;
I'll bless the day I discover 
another heart lookin' for love.
 
Then you came a knockin' at my heart's door;
You're ev'ry thing  I've been lookin' for. 
 
No more lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces
of what I'm dreamin' of.
 
Now that I've found a friend and a lover;
I bless the day that I discovered 
you, oh you; 
 
lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces

Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home)
She can be 18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare

Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

And I've got something to tell ya

Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""

Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why: why I fly by

We be them stud niggas, 'wishing you was' niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking

Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty want to knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss

Get done wid it,
Out of control like we begun wid it
Bricks explode, licked you out the show
That nigga Bump did it
I block, like Murdock, army fatigued and,
Bout to store blocks an` Fort Knox ya minor league shit
Breathe this, ballistic, shell like Khadafi
Bringin` the blizzards when I make bail you can`t stop me,
In jail all that I can see provoking hell,
Chokin` at a third rail velocity
Obviously ya men have, been barkin` up the wrong tree
Microphone strong deep bomb first
Ya mind burst within a rhyme verse
Dirty Bert rehearse the worse of me,
The black clip`s burnin` me
The cat who act fraternity
The landscape`s redded,
Fuck it ya man said it
Ya shoulda never let it escape
We won`t wet it,
Squeezing, leavin holes in ya crew,
Maestro can stand through,
When I pass the Mac to Rock that nigga brand you
When I pass the Mac to Rock that nigga brand you

Ten out of ten
No ya chance is a ninth
We do jail wid no bail
Losin` half of our life
Livin` the life of the poor
Losin` sight in the war
You can slice it down precise
Shit`s trife around the board

[Verse 2]
We in this thing together
Tryna build the same cheddar
It`s strange sometimes I think paranoid clutchin` my waist
A fake couldn`t relate to,
Drugs and honeys,
My hugs are funny
And thugs blow slugs for the money
Gunshots, mobbin` up quiet late nights
Walkin` down New, you betta think twice
This shit ain`t right,
It`s all wrong,
NARC`s we slide on
It ain`t safe season
Say it`s strength in numbers
We rolled the whole precint
Rev the whip up,
We live `98 stick-ups
Loadin` clips up
That flimsy ass vest we rip up
New Jerz, come check us
But don`t test us
Oppose, we throw holes in ya Lexus
Act whatever, clap whatever
When we clap we clap together
Leavin` you cats on the stretcher
O.N.S. and the Embassy,
Outlawz and Pentagon
If it ain`t that,
It ain`t shit to me
It ain`t shit to me

Fake lies, close ya eyes,

You little hip hop cop,
Playin` spy in the park
We turn schemes to cream
Cause we fiend for green
Wid the cops and streets watchin`
Ain`t no need to dream
Codine my team,
Full beam on ya knotty
Killuminati to ya body
Got mooned wid the shotti
Getto star you for Amaru,
Yak see you tomorrow,
I know you here,
These other niggas be like where are you?
The Henny`ll start you,
Dirty ever semi I borrow,
No confrontation or quarrel
I can`t shake up or startle
The time taker
Tying `em up like Ron Baker
Here to shake and break `em down
Like the LA Lakers
I see through `em
Ain`t no tellin` what I`ma bout to leave through `em
While he lay there I stay there
While the paramedics`ll breathe through him
Squeeze through him,
Put the E to him, hit `em up
He gon` lay there shakin` waitin` for y`all to pick him up
Ya outta there,
Quick as you squeal, I`ll appeal
It`s kill or be killed,
In this world of free steel
Every crew`s a game,
Wearin` blues is strange
From how you move you`ll be named
For what you doin` who you claim
You might, think it`s a game
From bein` critically acclaimed
A war winner for pitiful game
Fuck wid Hussein

From cops got our feet tired
Everybody split up anybody get caught
Son just keep quiet,
These C`s watchin` me,
Two CDS` of armed robbery
Terroristic bread and possession of stolen property,
Keep to myself that`s how I got to be, cats acknowledge me,
For the simple fact I live everyday of the week periodically
Premeditated robberies, how could you possibly
Mistake Imperial S for a mental or methology
I`m realer than the cats that shot at me
I think I`ll probably, ride by and let `em sample the varieties,
My hollow ain`t easy to swallow,
Like them five dollar bottles,
Kill or be killed`s my motto,
I do it cause I got to,
I`ma, straight up commodity
I thug in this society
On the side ah me`s my niggas that`ll die for me
Would you ride for me?, or get rode on?
Been in this game so long
I kick slick shit in every sentence
Y`all have to grow on,
Throughout my hard times my vision was blind
Hustlin` dimes fake niggas want to beef wid me
I ain`t puttin` it in my rhymes
You ain`t worth it,
Wid out contact I catch perfect,
Had the heart in front of the crowd
But in your eyes you nervous,
Now start chirpin`,
The .38 special start squirtin`
Leave two holes in ya shirt
And put you on the side street hurtin`,
Now that`s for talkin` out ya person,

Fatal,"[tame one]
Wait'll niggaz hear that tame and fatal got down and made it straight
From uptown with six sacks and this track that's in the background
Stop stressin from the chest up, we messed up
Off that best stuff that fits up in yo' dutch
Situation like this, you get blown to bits
Fuckin with this brick lyricist, more complex than the pyramids
Here it is, strictly biz like small print
In between them bong hits, we drop the strong shit
Chickenheads say, ""who him? "" with fucked up timb's
Knotty fro and baggy denims, spendin up the benjamins
In city tenaments, the boom skwadron odd man
Don't give a fuck like rodman (""what are you doing? "")
With no rings like patrick ewing (""what? "")
Still I play hard regardless
Acquitted from the charges throwin darts up at the heartless
Aimin for your brain, tame one, one of the darkest
Brown like the chocolate, poppin your metropolis

Chorus: fatal hussein

Around my way, all they do is shoot dice all day
Escapin secret indictments, gettin nice all day
Don't let em fold ya, outlawz, the getto star soldiers
Give this letter to the president, before this shit is over
(repeat 2x)

[fatal hussein]
When hussein aim, puttin they brains on walls like tame name
Blastin these motherfuckers cause they just can't maintain
Y'all plain jane's gel in the ? well's? county of sing-sing
Me and young noble, got em strung hold em for hostage
Lyrics verbally toxic, spit like doubled edged optics
My shit is milk, wearin silk shirts with chocolates
Y'all broke and can't cop shit, I get, physically fit
On some evil eye ready to die shit
This thug shit, niggaz get beat down and shot up
I saw this one nigga, get stolen on and your soul got up
Stolen car, roll past the bar, toured a lot of city
Gave him an eighth and he cooked his whole product
It's a shame how you cowards change the game for narcotic
You don't get it, don't got it, the love of money get exotic
If you old you get shot at, and can't walk the streets
Without gettin your lil' money hungry soft ass spot

Chorus

[fatal hussein]
We adapt to the system like ? eddie bap? on mission
Get an ounce of izm, two six-packs, and kid listen
Just a dip on the task, my little niggaz on the ave
Do a bid and laugh, come home and cop a half
Hit me with twenty hundred, what you got was fronted
Now run it, I got this fuckin drug spot where I want it
So don't be dissin new, when you ain't got shit to do
Five thousand dollars, charge free, right out municipal

[tame one]
Niggaz get played off to the left like they was southpaws
Toss you to the outlawz, then let them shoot it out
For what you clock for -- got more than you expected
When I inject correct shit, it gets hectic
Fuckin comin up with that next shit, thug niggaz and bugged niggaz
Luce? steel is tight, I'm straight up like midnight
We burn mics on turnpikes, we swervin through the lanes
We throw chains at bitches, it's back to new jeru to get these riches

Chorus
",Getto Star
Fatal,"[fatal - talking]
O.n.s. in this mother fucker
We got the plague in this mother fucker
The pentagon in this mother fucker

[verse 1 - fatal]
Around these blocks
You know these hot glocks
Cock till you drop
All you wanna-be cops
You don't wanna see shots
I beef deep with the police
Beat what the streets do to me
Actin all new to me
I'll creep on you like puberty
You don't wanna see the bad image
Of this primace
From here to east crems
Through every state with a sentence
Frozen weight in a couther
Six plates to soup ya
On due we always cruise
Right by the state troopers
When I'm drinkin with sal
I start thinkin 'bout al
Ricardi coverin my body
At the rink when I wow
I bag a hotty or two
This but a shotty for you
I got more bodies than drew
I drink mine naughty or new
Fuck your crew
This type of shit we do for a petty hobby
Fuck the whole world
This fatal dawg against everybody (it's on)
Better be twenty-five once this shit you never fuckin heard
Outlaw, outlaw, we rate these breaks
That shit we don't got be that shit we gotta take

[verse 2 - merciless x]
It's the merciless x
Like malcolm
Black as a falcon
How many shots I left depressed in your chest
I wasn't countin
But your back exploded (blaw!)
I episoded, with the weapon loaded
Let the next opponent
Get possessed with this merciless omen
The coldest crome to your dome
Sewn and holdin it's own
Let the barrel announce my ferocity
Twist spacious velocities
For haters watchin me
Make your block an atrocity
Break you down microscopic
Only doctors see, what the topic be
Drama through your armor
Bustin my two through your school of piranhas
My soldiers disapprove of your honor
We close captives, no conclusions
Let the revolver solve it
Evolve in this evolution
We shootin and pollutin

[chorus - fatal]
Pass the heat
And let me wave it in the air (air)
Guns bust, cowards fall
Niggaz just don't care (care)
To my lord I swear
We ain't never playin fair (fair)
On the streets you can't sleep
When the outlawz there
I know it's rainin on your block nigga (nigga)
You can't quit it
And you're prayin for it to stop nigga (nigga)
You shouldn't of did it
On a crash course chase of death (yeah, death)
Still thuggin on the streets (yeah)
Cause we the last ones left

[verse 3 - mac mall]
I take this thug shit seriously
Bought dirty gats with dope money
Atf can't fuck with me
My soldiers be
All there quiet
I'm holdin my crotch
Sippin henne nigga
You're life or you're not
Thug life my life
It don't stop
It's never too hot
And when I die I greet haze with glocks
Young crazy californians
Postin bout six in the mornin
On a quest to take the breath of my opponent
Them alls can't live
My cousins invite guns in they crib
Honey I'm home
Now nigga you're gone
Your bitch sing them songs
Like baritones to the rollers
When I saw her, I dumped on her
Like I supposed to
Now tell me what's funk without a mob year
And tell me what's a shrow without a witness
I only fuck with savages, soldiers, and hogs
From c.a. to n.j. mac mall be outlaws

[verse 4 - fatal]
Vocally undestructible
Your crew ain't got enough
To go clip to clip
When we shootin out on the strip
Cause I'm untouchable
I'll blast your
Chest through your back with kastro
Oh you ain't scared?
What the fuck you walkin so fast for?
Is you with me or against me
Don't run up on me and tempt me
To have your faggot ass bagged
Like a mother fuckin empty
And simply vengeance of dogs
We gets a real nigga
Let me borrow your bitch
And watch me go and chill with her
On a rise no lie
Go against me and die
Baby gated like a hive
On the side of me with a nine
Believe me
This shit makes circumstances much more devious
My murderous material
Got shorties livin mischievous
Smokin em is the easiest
The hard part is dealin with the fact
That I made it through rap
And gotta go back to killin
Cause broke niggaz be illin
Wantin money for a shoot or somethin
But you get nothin but murder when I be shootin somethin

Chorus

[fatal - talking]
Yeah, we doubt y'all cause we outlaws
You better know breakin it all
Tappin your pocket and your jaw
In one swing nigga
Merciless x, fatal hussein, nigga
This ain't no game
We re-arrange your whole frame
Word is born, all y'all niggaz better maintain
I leave a chain of blood stains
Represent, never hesitant
All we out for is fuckin dead presidents
What? hah, what? yeah, it ain't hard to find
Out with nicco storm and it's on
Droppin bombs like vietnam

[Verse One]
Won't you niggaz, take a look at a real thug
And see why, ya bitches get suspicious and peal slugs, at me
Til the day I die, high motherfucker tryin'
To think of somethin', other then dyin'
What the fuck could you do me, but laugh and diss
Stay in your place, while a real playa mash to this
I know it's heaven for G's, M-11 to squeeze
Bout an ounce, and body counts, to drop pass seven degrees
I'm a neva go home, blastin' on you bitch made
Jealous ass niggaz, switchin' up like a switch blade
Life is what you make it, I'm make it in dope
My dog died in jail cell, shakin' from rope
It's only one way out the game, and I suggest you stay
From escapade, profess you chest and laid
Put ya guns down, shoot for revolution, and mash
In other words, keep your shit cocked shootin' for cash

Life ain't what, it used to be
Things ain't the way they used to be, the world is changin'
Will I live or will I die? Will I ever see the light?

[Verse Two]
My next kin to crew, is a selected few
If you don't fuck wit me, they won't bust at you
I been from Cali, Sac the Bay Area and back
In this world that's all black, more critical wit the mack
I rush 'em all, kick it to they bitches and fuck 'em all
Evil eye ya squad, they all soft, I stuck em 'all
Why'all niggaz gon' despise on me, makin' thugs out you suckas
Come and ride for me, dyin' is the hardest part of livin' ya life
Talkin' slick, after tellin' me that bitch was ya wife
So your fiancee, probably goin' wild for me
I write a letter to my un-born child
And tell my baby girl to smile for me

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Bumpin', jumpin' from jeerz, wit these thugs that hide ten's
On they hips six-shooters, inside a buggy-I Benz
Approach hard, slidin' speed roads, from the coast guard
Better warn you, befo I put somethin' on you 
And it your folks hard, that Henny mix
Rappers fire quick like twenty blix, any click beefin'
'cause, they don't city wit, loves goin' get cha
Hussein been it, affendin' ya little dogs
Puttin' thugs on a stretcher, so suffer
Look at her wiggle, and don't touch her
Must cha make suicidal threats, to cuff her
You ain't a playa(nigga), while you ridin' a bitch
And ain't a ridah, now you's a sucka and ya pride is clinched
Once she go thug, so always be thugged
Remember that son, all I want is action
Won't hesitate to clap one, the east and the west
Got me packed and stressed, but through the pain
All I'm tryin' to, is gain happiness
Why don't you niggaz, take a look at a real thug
And see, why these suckas tryin' ball on me, me god {*echoes*}

[Chorus: x8]
Is you an Outlaw? (I'm an Outlaw)
I went from Dirty Bruce man to Hussein, it's a two game table

Fatal I'll run up with my gun up, try to shoot tanks nigga
You don't want it when I cock the pump, cock and dump
Let off at ya shots and lump, I gots to dump
Shoot from jail, block ya bump
If I fell off, I caught on and forgot to jump
Sheech ya man, he'll never speak again
Greet ya fam, ice grill heat in hand
What's the deal?, real niggas tuck the steal
Bust to kill, big bends is up the hill
Locks it down, take it when I cock the pound
Rock ya town, and roll when the top is down
Is Pac around? I don't know, Kadaf was found
One in the head, dead on the project ground
If it's on then it's on, we rape beat breaks
Outlawz! they want to be us on a fake we takes

[Chorus: x8]

Apply pressure like pliars, whatever my kind desires
It ain't hard to find us, we even started as minors
Put the bullshit behind us, we movin' forward
Eat cheese and get you killed, and whoever you wasn't caught with
Signing statements, now I'm flying places
Denying that you hating, that's the way that ya go
How did I know?
Look at what the game done to me
Mother-fuck the world 'cause we grew up ? trust me
I stay dusty like I live down in New, I'm used to
Fell off the block now we're selling out stores
Yelling Outlaw when we riding down you street
Niggas think that Pac gone that it ain't no beef
You fuckin'' dickhead, Outlawz spit lead
And tonight, when you come home I'm gon' be laying in your bed
So when you put your key in the lock, make sure your heat cocked
You was scared when he was alive, but now you gotta face Pac, it's on

[Chorus: x8]

Sicker than same faces, Hussein case is not to
Be forgot, nigga ask Pac who shot you
Last block I got you, burnt it up on y'all
Can I stop you?, see'mon dogg, I turn it up on y'all
Little homo thugs and that's word to Kadafi
I spit at Mobb Deep, had to holla at Junior Mafia
Toured with Yak, watching fake niggas spit out
Ignored the eyes, told them jake niggas ""get outta here""
Hit em with that, I diss y'all and stand in the jects
Handiling techs, lick off and hit your man in the neck
And you was next, you ran so I spit on your back
My daughter a firebug, so she sit on the mac
Stop with your job, I cock and put my glock in ya eyes
You think I'd be sitting in the county if Pac was alive
I'm illa than that, Outlawz is realer than that
If ya wifey be feeling Hussein, then I'm feeling her back
You ain't no Outlaw

Watered down ass nigga, Bitch made nigga
Suck a dick!

Spinnin' jumpin' and grindin'
As if they had wings on their feet
Raising both hands in the air as if Jesus was the DJ himself
Spinnin those funky funky funky house beats

And in this temple we all pray in unity for the same thing
With matic pause without cause
Bass from those high definition speakers
Sitting in the corner on each side of the room
Givin' us the boom boom boom
To our zoom zoom zoom

The smell of a L lit while walking by
But the music gets me high
Saint defy like and old lady in church
We get happy
We stomp our feet
We clap our hands
We shout
We cry
We dance
And we say
Sweet Lord, speak to me
Speak to me, speak to me, speak to me
Because we love house music
And on this planet it brings us together
Like a family reunion every week
We eat
We drink
We laugh
We play
And we skate
So for all you hip hoppers
You do woppers
Name droppers
You bill boppers
Come into our house
To get deep

That journey-a have it's way,
an' have me wonderin' all my days.

I can't stay home, I gotta keep movin,
I gotta keep doin', I gotta get out,
I gotta roam, it's somethin' that moves me,
It's somethin' that uses me without a doubt,
'cause somewhere abstract coincidence happens,
see someone in passin' while out and about,
next thing I know I'm happily travelin',
puttin' in action ideas that I mouth,
cause I speak it and do it, talk it and walk it,
I'm so bad about it, I shout it out loud,
but try to stay open, the forces in motion,
They keep me on course, it's just clear that i've found (?),
Imprissoned in flesh and reality's blesses,
that made manifest every woman and child,
I'll keep on expressin' reality's lessons,
explorin' my prison until I'm let out.

That journey-a call my name,
That journey-a have it's way,
an' have me wonderin' all my days
That journey-a call me quick,
That journey-a call my name,
That journey-a have it's way,
have me wonderin' all my days.

Travelin' East and West, on every known highway,
South to North carryin' that torch until I'm old and grey.

Well in the mean time inbetween I'm pushin' through this,
I said in the main time inbetween I'm on my duty.

Sometimes I get beat up, sometimes I'm the beater,
Sometimes man my feet hurt from walkin' so long,
Sometimes I'm defeated, sometimes I get cheated,
Sometimes I just need it, 'cause sometimes I'm wrong,
So the question's repeated, why even try?
When there's rocks in the road, pot-holes in the lawn,
The victory's sweeter when obstacles either,
Are side-stepped or crushed on the way to the door,
So I go on my own, have faith in the road,
I can share that control cause I'm never alone.
I hear the creator speak to me through wispers,
On winds the voices of friends and of foes,
I listen to omens, the things that he shows me,
Shows that he knows me and helps me along,
And follow him closely, where he goes mostly,
Guidin' my path on this map 'till I'm gone

That journey-a call me quick,
That journey-a call my name,
That journey-a have it's way,
an' have me wonderin' all my days
That journey-a call me quick,
That journey-a call my name,
That journey-a have it's way,
an' have me wonderin' all my days.

And when they lay me down,
To rest in my Earthly grave,
And when they lay me down,
Navigate that big sky wave.

But in the meantime I, I got my duty,
In the meantime inbetween time I, I got to do this,
In the meantime inbetween time I, I'm pushin through this,
In the meantime inbetween time I, I got my duty.

And the cameras are fixed on me again,

The skies so red that I'm loosing my mind
I can't get my head to stop this feeling inside
The four walls are coming and I can't get outside

There steeling my toys leave no memories behind

They ? my thoughts not cars or trains

Bust for my borrowers and settle the score

Running around, feet on the ground

And no one seem to wanna sit with me.

Fatboy Slim,"A bomb went off this morning raining bodies on TV
They are blaming the insurgents; they are blocking off the streets
And the smoke is rising slowly from the barrel of a gun
The solution to disruption: Order 1081

Now the sunsets are incredible across Manila Bay
You can hear the bombers landing at the U.S. Air Force base
And somewhere in the distance, out beyond the setting sun
They will sign a proclamation: Order 1081

Now, we live down by the water in a shack that's made of wood
And the bankers need to huddle so they need some extra room
We will find us somewhere better; there's enough for everyone
Got a perfect explanation: Order 1081

I thought I ordered coffee, but they gave me 7-Up
Got to clear away these shanties and these ugly nipa huts
So the seeds of our great future, they can grow here when we're done
And it's clearly all because of Order 1081

For thirty days the rain fell--we were nearly washed away
The radio fell silent; nothing left to do but pray
And the senator he told us the guerrillas are on the run
And the reason they are hiding? Order 1081

They are planting plastic flowers on the seaside esplanade
The Pope is speaking Spanish, but we can't hear what he says
Got to stop all this confusion, got to wipe away this scum
And the way to make it happen: Order 1081

It's amazing that the soldiers somehow all know how to dance
It's amazing how the soldiers keep the creases in their pants
Now it's safe to walk the streets at night; a new world has begun
Everybody's sleeping soundly thanks to 1081",Order 1081

And who's gonna fold
And who's got a secret?
And who's feeling bold?

It's a winning combination

That the King and the Queen of Hearts
Could be a perfect hand

But be prepared to bluff
There are many ways to win a game
And skill is not enough

You know how to get things done

You open a door for yourself

""To try is to succeed""
Fried chicken and the Rumba
The colors pink and cream

Ninoy was my first love
But he said I was too tall
A rich girl stole the sweetheart
Of the Rose of Tacloban

The heart grows slightly colder
Necessary to survive
And money makes it easy
In many people's lives

The sky above protects us
Don't know what I will become
Or what lies beyond tomorrow
For the Rose of Tacloban

The love and women
On a magazine page
Elegant woman
Like a paper parade

I don't go out dancing
I just stay at home
Cutting out their faces
And replacing them with my own

And replacing them with me own

Seven years down in the hole, they said
""Your watch, your glasses, and your wedding ring
You won't need them anymore""

I felt abandoned--I felt cast aside
So where is God who never sleeps?
I heard a voice say, ""Why do you cry?""
Then I found my inner peace

Ninoy, you were my first love
But you said I was too tall
The heart gets stronger and grows colder
For the Rose of Tacloban

I begged to God, could he forgive me now
And take back all those things I said?
This moment was a gift from above
Maybe it's some kind of test

Ninoy, remember a long time ago
You used to walk me to my home?
Who set you free? Who built this hospital?
You think I hate you, but you're wrong

For seven years I wore this crucifix
A necklace that watched over me
Face to face with mortality
I let go of all my fears

Now my husband he might hate you
But you know I saved your life

Fates Warning,"Isolation freezes my life, coldness grips my heart
Trapped within a world, a world apart
Desolate am I, a tempest raging silently
Lost a-barren, adrift at sea

Catatonic state, it sharpens life's depressing edge
The clamor draws me closer to the ledge
As I gaze upon this burning world, I curse this life
A life through which I'm hurled

Lies, lies upon this side and that
Truthless violence, deception, mourned by the wise
Thousands of voices drowning out his own
In a popular torrent of lies upon lies
Turn to stone

So intense the pain that has crawled
From the bleeding corpse of pleasure
That feeds the worm the writhes
Inside my brain

In the deep of night it stirs again
In the heart of the sleeper
From the crack of dawn I wake to curse
The rising of the sun

Every life is built on hope
Now my dreams have surely passed
Inner voices haunt my numbered days
Darkness calls me with her laughs

Torn between life and death inertia
Fills my soul
No will to be nor pride to care
Reapers take your toll

Strangers cast a menacing glance
As existence I defy
Shatter their dream like world I'm not
Afraid to die

Omen bird soars the desert land to the castle
Of idolence, there lies the shadow of a man
See the colored flowers and marble towers
They fade to brown

Like the unknown inscribed in stone
He's abandoned, abandoned flesh and bones
He's lost in silence, swallowed in vastness
Drowned in the depths of a meaningless
Past

Fates Warning,"When the stars are right, and you're alone
Take a journey, lock the world tight
Out of your mind
The hall beckons your presence, the doors
Open wide you're to decide to turn back.
Deep the bowels of this black abyss
Compelled I just can't resist it, take me

[Chorus:]
Take me away take me away
I want to know what's deep within
Take me away
Drawing near someone passes through me
A silent entity never looking back I won't dare
Evil eyes staring through the walls of stone
As I feared I travel not alone
Laughter echoes with the blatant wind
I have passed the threshold deep within me


[Repeat Chorus]

A voice of thunder said turn back
Tabernacle is forbidden
No mortal dares to enter here
I want to know
Flame is burning, center of a fountain yearning, water
Spring eternal, spiritual water physical fire
Above center is sky, cold cold neverness
Just vastness filled with stars upon stars
In the four corners of life are the golden mirrors
Reflecting what you are and what you are to be
In the first is a young boy white dove in
His hand, in the second is a warrior in armor,
In the third is the old man, gold watch
In his hand, fourth and last

No reflection at all
No reflection at all
No reflection at all
Waters rise towards physical fire, voice says
Tabernacle is forbidden never looking back, I won't dare
If the water touches the flame
Forever in darkness yes I'll remain
White dove flies from the young boys hand
Through the mirror of the old man, only way out

Deepest of sin, envision a king

Dancing with the banshee, fire rose up to the sky

The dead of night parts the sky, the Salem witch
Hunting eyes Malefica spells
She flies the ocean shore of Kildare over tombs of the harpy fields
Lonely girls ride the great beast, Virginal Goddess of Hunt Diana

Wailing ghost guitars send in the clowns, send in the clowns

Masque the false Gods with mannequin smiles
Prima Donna's play upon their pedestal of fame
The unborn girls false fascade

Blasphemous black Bible bias you betray bigotry
Slay the hydra pretty maidens spread their leprosy
Hungry children feed from hype of perpetual egoes
I slay the hydra, burn the talisman, holocaust man

Run with the pack illegitimate child the unborn wench at war
Tears him inside she became a bride wedlock to a whore
Shatter the dreams, that tangerine dreams, bow to Kings not the Queens
Go back where you reign rule your domain the Valley of the Dolls

Bow to Kings of yesterday, they have given you wings to fly away
What have the Phantom Queens but deceived you
Armies of shadows climbing silvery mountains lining molten and

Camouflage the battle scars with oxyten and Maybelline
Cloning the heroes in hype magazine
Pirates of underground
Lightening the speed of sound you will prevail

Oh oh

Fates Warning,"By black we ride, or so they say
Our need for reason, there greed is paid
Powers rumble for spiritual sway
Paths are laid then leaders stray

It's right then left, witch way to turn
Follow me or forever burn
We evil blessed, bring your soul to sell
All wish away into empty wells

Fortunes found in holy halls
Redeem your every fault
When dogmas given are blindly held
And treasures given caught
Any wish can only last
Until the spell's descried
While subtle, wicked ways
Fracture weakened minds

Slaves of a different kind march to broken bells
Freedom in a bind and make it all sound well
Blackened blue etched in glass forming outer walls
Tell clearly of the emptiness and mute distressful calls

Lines lead to dead ends where
Plays seen are never clear
And those who ride never fare

Crowned voids forever rule
In worlds lived and learned of fools
Conformity's the teachers' tool

The subtle purity
Of youthful inspiration
And insecurity.
Nothing left to say,

Pride, and the drive that started the dream,
Turned, in time, to an endless obsession.
Caught in a vicious circle of compulsion.
Possessed by the goal and the possession.
Desires bind the truth to secrecy,
But behind the aspirations I see
A life devoted to blind ambition.
And a mortal man searching for eternity
Behind the desires.
And the wall that gave way.
There's a forgotten cause,
Consumed by the day,
Behind the ambitions
Of a child who found his way.
There's a cold realization
That our deeds die with the day.
And behind the disguise
Of a man with a cause,
There's a child screaming.

Paralyzed by inhibitions
And indecisions,

Time enough now to catch my breath
Holding on to each fleeting moment
Until the winds of change come blowing through

And all the things I
Thought I needed
Go sailing out of you, oh

I thought I'd reach a new beginning
Faint, distant glow on the horizon
Holding on to the promise of the day
Until the sunset hides sea from shore

And all the things I
Thought I needed
Don't mean much anymore

Circles within circles
Hoping one more turn
Will bring us to the end

When truth and fiction finally meet
We find again
New beginnings become old ends

Circles within circles
Hoping one more turn
Will bring us to the end

When the circles complete
We find ourselves
Starting all over again

Too many things left undone, too late to turn back
I can change course before the end
But when all is said and done
All I really want is a chance to start again

Circles within circles
Hoping one more turn
Will bring us to the end

When truth and fiction finally meet
We find again
New beginnings become old ends

Circles within circles
Hoping one more turn
Will bring us to the end

When the circles complete
We find ourselves
Starting all over again

Fates Warning,"From sleeping visions
Daily were torn
In waking hours
Hopes our forlorn.
Is all we do and all we dream
Doomed to drown in a hopeless stream?

Wishing life were made of lasting visions
In eternal sleep
And if that rest were filled with sorrow
Still we'd sleep.

In the madness of a silent eternity
We'd find solace in
False visions that protect us
From reality.

Enter ivory gates through midnight skies
Daylight dreamers in private parades
Perform before perpetual dawn
As dusk engulfs the gate of horn.

Ivory towers appear beyond the gate
Invisible fortresses of escape
Traversed by ramparts made of hopes and fears
Impervious to reality.",Quiteus
Fates Warning,"Born to an air of apathy
Indifference shapes of fragile minds.
Questions formed at an early age
Beg answers unasked.
Silent cries
Behind curious eyes resides
A child who cannot speak.
Years find a mind alone whose
Questions flow too deep for words.
Covered in a shroud of silence
Watching the world go by.
Silent cries
Behind outcast eyes, hides
A child who cannot speak.
Time blindly races on
Towards the autumn years
Seasons unheeded pass
While we all drown in tears.
Questions unanswered remain
Alone they mourn a fragile mind
Silent cries
Behind lifeless eyes lies
A child who cannot speak.",Silent Cries
Fates Warning,"today was the end of a dream
as I watched your shadow disappear
another moment for the memory
as we lose another year

thought I heard You call my name
but YOU only said goodbye

always somewhere we only say goodbye
going nowhere
we only say goodbye
there's never time to say
all the things we need to say
when it's too late
we can only say goodbye

tonight I felt your presence again
as we shared the sorrow we've always known
but I heard the distance in your voice
and I knew I was alone

tried to tell YOU my deepest thoughts
but I only said goodbye

always somewhere we only say goodbye
going nowhere
we only say goodbye
there's never time to say
all the things we need to say
when it's too late
we can only say goodbye

across the miles
both of us reaching we try
but it's so hard to touch
when we only say goodbye

always somewhere
we only say goodbye
going nowhere
we only say goodbye
there's never time to say
all the things we need to say
when it's too late

Do you think that I, that I recall
When you were falling
And I just watched it all?

When you were breaking
And I just let the pieces fall?

Fates Warning,"This shade of gray
This certain sadness
This cold morning light
And this silent madness
It hangs in the air
It hangs like a memory
It hangs like a cloud
It hangs on desperately
Between dark and light
Between was and be
Between young and old
Between you and me
Between you and me

I remember cities
And I remember rain
Like the sound of your voice, falling
These memories and more remain
I remember winter
And I remember strain
Like the sound of your voice, breaking
These memories and more remain
I remember the nights
And I remember pain
Like the sound of your voice, alone
These memories and more remain

So where do we begin
And what else can we say?
When the lines are all drawn
What should we do today?

Close our eyes awhile
As morning shadows play
And listen to the rain
Wash the long night away
Face to face we'll awake
To see another day
And with hope in our hearts
Embrace this shade of gray
This pleasant shade of gray",A Pleasant Shade of Gray: Pt. 12
Fates Warning,"Are you listening
Am I here screaming?
Drowning in a silent sea
Or only dreaming?

Drifting in and out

Lying in shadows
Replaying a thousand regrets

Can you hear me
Am I getting through?
A million miles away
Or here beside you?

Drifting in and out
His heart never forgets
Lying in shadows
Replaying a thousand regrets

And the minutes just pass
As the hours change
And the shifting sands

Fates Warning,"Stayed up late last night
Lying here in bed
Looking for words
To say the things I left unsaid
Wind at my window
Whispers to me instead
And I lie alone
Writing letters in my head

Where you are, I am
Through nights that never end
Where you are, I am
In words I'll never send

Walked alone last night
Cold streets of could be anywhere
Looking for words
To share the thoughts I could not share
Road at my heels
Takes me away instead
And I walk alone
Writing letters in my head

Where you are, I am
Through streets that never end
Where you are, I am
In words I'll never send

Where you are, I am
Through nights that never end
Where you are, I am

Never, never send

Still looking for words
Still writing letters in my head",A Pleasant Shade of Gray: Pt. 9
Fates Warning,"Ours is the cry of the helpless, told
In the timeless truth of the written word
Trapped by the tempest of the blind
Our muted calls can't be heard
Helpless as we stand
Amidst the push of thoughtless hands
We are adrift without direction
In a raging storm on a calm sea
Clinging to our expectations
To stem the tide of destiny
Helpless as we fall
Beneath the crush of waters walls",At Fates Hands

II. Cold Daze
The coldness of confusion
Hangs in the morning air as
Brazen bells ring reality
To announce the conqueror dawn
Removed from nights fleeting trance
Plunged headlong into cold days
Where in a circle we wander
The barren wastes of our pasts

III. Daylight Dreamers
Daylight dreamers awaken on
Deserts of desperation
Lonely lives learn to live on
Islands of isolation
Surrounded by violent oceans
Of hate and hopeless sorrows
Daylight dreamers envision
Tranquil seas in save tomorrows
Dreaming through the darkened day
Along tempest torn strands
Desperately grasping the grains
Of hope that flit through our hands
As they fall we tighten our hold
While the waves claim the final few
Taken without ceremony
They drift out of view
Washed away with the tides of time
Slipped through our fingers as dreams do

IV. Quietus
From sleeping visions
Daily were torn
In waking hours
Hopes are forlorn
Is all we do and all we dream
Doomed to drown in a hopeless stream?
Wishing life were made of lasting visions
In eternal sleep
And if that rest were filled with sorrow
Still we'd sleep
In the madness of a silent eternity
We'd find solace in
False visions that protect us
From reality
Enter ivory gates through midnite skies
Daylight dreamers in private parades
Perform before perpetual dawn
As dusk engulfs the gate of horn.
Ivory towers appear beyond the gate
Invisible fortressess of escape
Traversed by ramparts made of hopes and fears
Impervious to reality

V. Ivory Tower
Behind sullen doors
Untouched within
Safe from summer storms
And winter winds
Relentless tempests
Can weaken walls
Towers falter when
Reality calls
Untouchable by all without
Lost in the silken web youth may weave
Tangled threads seem a stronghold
But illusions can deceive
A cold daze plagues the air
Driven by aging winds
The walls give way to the rush
And let reality in

VI. Whispers on the wind
Misty morning on a windswept plain
Embers of a fortress all that remain
The seeds of life that burned within
Have flown like whispers on the wind
From the sleepers world
I look towards darkening skys
Through the violet haze of summer storms
The sun leaves tired eyes

VII.Acquiescence
Betrayed by innocence
Deceived by delusions
Plagiarized promises
Pale into empty hopes
Ivory towers bow down
In reference to daylight
As dreamers awaken
In sleepers somber shade
Ocean waves shift leaving
Only memories
Final traces of hope
Are swallowed in the deep
Despair sends a certain calm
A vague sense of relief
Released from all our longings
Silently we'll sleep
Hope leads to quiet desperation
When reality obscures the dream
Makes the mind a grave of memories
That wander like the lonely breeze
Whose whispers echo through ruins rust
Of towers torn and dreams turned to dust

VIII. Retrospect",The Ivory Gates of Dreams
Fates Warning,"There's a blind desire there's a drive
There's a need to leave some lasting feat
Something to hold, something to keep
A monument to complete

There's a written page there's a book
There's a search for something to say
Something to share, something to speak
A monument to convey

Is it a passion or just a profession
Is it performance, is it expression
Is it a passion or just an obsession

Something to save, something to see
A monument to enshrine

Is it a passion or just a profession
Is it fiction, is it confession
Is it a passion or just an obsession

Fates Warning,"Was standing in the darkness
I was watching over you
And all the fears came drifting back
With every little breath you drew
Wished upon a falling star
Cold and pale against the night
And all the fears came drifting back
To cloud the view and steal the light

Was underneath a falling snow
I was lying next to you
And all the fears came floating down
With every little wind that blew
Wished upon a passing cloud
Cold and pale against the gray

There was a common goal
But somehow that vision has died

We've grown so tired of trying
Wasting our time criticizing

Oh, and nothing's easy anymore

The subtle purity

Of youthfull inspiration
And insecurity

Pride and the drive that started the dream
Turned in time to an endless obsession
Caught in a vicious circle of compulsion
Possessed by the goal and the possession

Desires bind the truth to secrecy
But behind the aspirations I see
A life devoted to blind ambition
And a mortal man searching for eternity

Behind the desires
And the wall that gave way
There's a forgotten cause
Consumed by the day

Behind the ambitions
Of a child who found his way
There's a cold realization
That our deeds die with the day

And behind the disguise
Of a man with a cause

We leave the station
Long long miles ahead
To an unknown destination
Landscape in gray
Meets a tired eye
Like the years unnoticed

Out there, somewhere

And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens

I wonder if she even knows what that word means
Well, it's literally not that

Of the few main things I hate about her, one's her petty, vogue ideas
Someone's been told too many times they're beyond their years
By every half-wit of distinction she keeps around
And now every insufferable convo
Features her patiently explaining the cosmos
Of which she's in the middle

Has commentary been more lucid than anybody else?
And had he successively beaten back the rising tide
Of idiots, dilettantes, and fools
On his watch while he was alive
Lord, just a little more time

Oh, in no time at all
This'll be the distant past
Ooh

So says the dying man once I'm in the box
Just think of all the overrated hacks running amok
And all of the pretentious, ignorant voices that will go unchecked
The homophobes, hipsters, and 1%
The false feminists he'd managed to detect
Oh, who will critique them once he's left?

Father John Misty,"The comedy of man starts like this
Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips
And so Nature, she divines this alternative
We emerged half-formed and hope that whoever greets us on the other end
Is kind enough to fill us in
And, babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever since

Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to address
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron deficient
So somebody's got to go kill something while I look after the kids
I'd do it myself, but what, are you going to get this thing its milk?
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we can switch
It's hard not to fall in love with something so helpless
Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this

Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy
Just waiting until the part where they start to believe
They're at the center of everything
And some all-powerful being endowed this horror show with meaning

Oh, their religions are the best
They worship themselves yet they're totally obsessed
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks, these unbelievable outfits
And they get terribly upset
When you question their sacred texts
Written by woman-hating epileptics

Their languages just serve to confuse them
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring
And hand out prizes when someone patents the cure
Where did they find these goons they elected to rule them?
What makes these clowns they idolize so remarkable?
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new gods
So they can go on being godless animals

Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but to believe
Their horizons that just forever recede
And how's this for irony, their idea of being free is a prison of beliefs
That they never ever have to leave

Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman would conceive!
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive is the struggle to survive
But the only thing that they request is something to numb the pain with

By the water tower and hiking trails
And when the big one hit I’d have a seat
To watch masters abandon their dogs and dogs run free
Oh baby, it’s time to leave
Take the van and the hearse down to New Orleans
Leave under the gaze of the billboard queens
Five-foot chicks with parted lips selling sweatshop jeans

These L.A. phonies and their bullshit bands
That sound like dollar signs and Amy Grant

Entitled ""The Oldest Man in Folk Rock Speaks”
You can hear it all over the airwaves
The manufactured gasp of the final days
Someone should tell them ‘bout the time that they don’t have
To praise the glorious future and the hopeless past

But if you want ecstasy or birth control

She's like, ""Oh great, that's just what we all need
Another white guy in 2017
Who takes himself so goddamn seriously.""
She's not far off, the strange thing is
That's pretty much what I thought when I started this
It took me my whole life to learn to the play the G
But the role of Oedipus was a total breeze

Still I dreamt of garnering all rave reviews

In the form of his major label debut""

Don't want to be that guy but it's my birthday
If everything ends with the photo then I'm on my way

Oh

I watched my old gods all collapse
Were way more violent than my cartoon past
It's like my father said before he croaked
""Son, you're killing me, and that's all folks.""
So why is it I'm so distraught
That what I'm selling is getting bought
At some point you just can't control
What people use your fake name for

So I never learned to play the lead guitar
I always more preferred the speaking parts
Besides there's always someone willing to
Fill up the spaces that I couldn't use
Nonetheless, I've been practicing my whole life
Washing dishes, playing drums, and getting by
Until I figured, if I'm here then I just might
Conceal my lack of skill here in the spotlights
Maya, the mother of illusions, a beard, and I

2000 years or so since Ovid taught
Night-blooming, teenage rosebuds, dirty talk
And I'm merely a minor fascination to
Manic virginal lust and college dudes
I'm beginning to begin to see the end
Of how it all goes down between me and them
Some 10-verse chorus-less diatribe
Plays as they all jump ship, ""I used to like this guy
This new shit really kinda makes me wanna die""

Oh

My first memory of music's from
The time at JCPenney's with my mom
The watermelon candy I was choking on
Barbara screaming, ""Someone help my son!""
I relive it most times the radio's on
That ""tell me lies, sweet little white lies"" song
That's when I first saw the comedy won't stop for
Even little boys dying in department stores

These days the years thin till I can't remember
Just what it feels like to be young forever

So the longer I stay here
The longer there's no future

Father John Misty,"It got too hot and so we overthrew the system
'Cause there's no place for human existence like right here
On this bright blue marble orbited by trash
Man, there's no beating that
It was no big thing to give up the way of life we had

Oh ho oh

My social life is now quite a bit less hectic
The nightlife and the protests are pretty scarce
Now I mostly spend the long days walking through the city
Empty as a tomb
Sometimes I miss the top of the food chain
But what a perfect afternoon

Industry and commerce toppled to their knees
The gears of progress halted
The underclass set free
The super-ego shatters with our ideologies
The obscene injunction to enjoy life
Disappears as in a dream
And as we return to our native state
To our primal scene
The temperature, it started dropping
The ice floes began to freeze

From time to time we all get a bit restless
With no one advertising to us constantly
But the tribe at the former airport
Some nights has meat and dancing
If you don't mind gathering and hunting
We're all still pretty good at eating on the run
Things it would have been helpful to know before the revolution

Though I'll admit some degree of resentment
For the sudden lack of convenience around here
But there are some visionaries among us developing some products
To aid us in our struggle to survive

After mister and the missus finish dinner and the dishes
And now the future's definition is so much higher than it was last year
It's like the images have all become real
And someone's living my life for me out in the mirror

No, can you believe how far we've come
In the New Age?
Freedom to have what you want
In the New Age we'll all be entertained
Rich or poor, the channels are all the same
You're a star now, baby, so dry your tears
You're just like them
Wake on up from the nightmare

Come on
Oh ho oh
Oh
Oh ho oh

No gods to rule us
No drugs to soothe us
No myths to prove stuff
No love to confuse us

Not bad for a race of demented monkeys
From a cave to a city to a permanent party

Father John Misty,"When the god of love returns
There'll be hell to pay
Though the world may be out of excuses
I know just what I would say
Let the seven trumpets sound
As a locust sky grows dark
But first let's take you on a quick tour of your creation's handiwork

Barely got through the prisons and stores
And the pale horse looks a little sick
Says, ""Jesus, you didn't leave a whole lot for me
If this isn't hell already then tell me what the hell is?""

And we say it's just human, human nature
This is place is savage and unjust
We crawled out of the darkness
And endured your impatience
We're more than willing to adjust
And now you've got the gall to judge us

The spider spins his web
The tiger stalks his prey
And we steal fire from the heavens to try to keep the night at bay
Every monster has a code
One that steadies the shaking hand
And he's determined to accrue more capital by whatever means he can

Oh, it's just human, human nature
We've got these appetites to serve
You must not know the first thing about human beings
We're the earth's most soulful predator
Try something less ambitious the next time you get bored

Some warmth in the cold

To be loyal and gentle and lay and lent

Why girls play with my feelings?
I don't know so that's why I ask
Maybe it's true that I set myself up
But then again it's the question I asked
I want someone for me who is straight
A kind of cutie. Yes, yep, a smart mate
I've been around searching for the right one
But it seems like a waste of my time
Every time that I meet the right 1
It seems as if she plays with my mind
So it makes me on the defense side
Because my offense is sort of slow
It doesn't pay to tell someone ""I love you""
Because in my vocab ""I love u"" is a no, no
I think I give in. My feelings, they show
I think I'd better not look back
I've been down a little too long
And now it's time that I get on track
So I must... 

Chorus

I like to mingle when I do mingle
I love to mingle when I do flirt
I get off hand and tell the stories
About my past & that's when it hurts
But I need to find for me a lonesome lady type
Who wants me for self
A woman who wants me because of Father
Not for the fame or for my wealth
So I can ""Show her how I feel""
Yeah, ladies I'm not that picky
But being picky is just for self
I must protect what I respect
And that is me & not someone else
I've been mistreated up on the downhill
Back in the days I used to be strong
I used to flirt, hurt, kind of jerk
Get the cash, the sex then I'm gone
But payback is a mother
And now I don't know who to trust
So I just... 

Chorus

Yeah, you know women? Yeah they tell me I'm lovely & cuddly but I just don't understand why they want to play with my feelings. But it won't happen again.
Nah, never.

(No, no no no no no...)

So listen ladies I'll treat you
How you treat me back in return.
I'm not rude. No, I'm not stuck up
But my feelings are my main concern
So don't think that I'd give in
Cause now I know how to show
My feelings when I get involved
I'll take it slow before I say ""Oh, No""
I'll treat you like you treat me
I'll be straight loyal & all
So don't take advantage of Father
Because I'll step up but not crawl
So give me what you can give me
Love, attention, a lot of respect
I don't ask for a whole lot
But I'm gone if you wanna step
That's why I like to take it slow
Not rush because I want more
The next time that I fall in love
Hmm, you bets I'll be sure

You are the reason why I've reached perfection
You are the reason why I try to tend this fertile void

These are heroic times
So thumb your nose at years gone by
Be hardened, we're a legend
Now love keeps the country green
I know because I've seen the pictures
In this week's scriptures

All I know is that I feel you coming near
All you need know is that your (prophet elector) is waiting

Fato,"Si pudiera ser tu cama
O la funda de tu almohada
Ser el agua que te moja
O la toalla que te abraza
Y secar tu piel mojada

Si pudiera ser tu sombra
Y seguirte a donde vayas
Ser el aire que respiras
El espejo donde a diario
Te maquillas

Pero solo soy, un simple terrenal
Que vive alucinando
Eso de llamarte por las noches y colgar
Se me sigue dando

Pero solo soy, un simple terrenal
Que sueña con tenerte
Mientras vivas yo no quito el dedo del renglón
Para tu buena suerte

Si pudiera ser la ropa
Que te viste y que te toca
Ser el cauce de tu río
El sueño más erótico, y prohibido

Pero solo soy, un simple terrenal
Que vive alucinando
Eso de llamarte por las noches y colgar
Se me sigue dando

Pero sólo soy, un simple terrenal
Que sueña con tenerte
Mientras vivas yo no quito el dedo del renglón
Para tu buena suerte

When over yonder hill the moon is climbing
It always finds me wishin' on a star

It's only a shanty in old shanty town
Because the roof is so slanty
It touches the ground
But my tumble down shack
Is by an old railroad track
Like a millionaire's mansion
Keep callin' me back
I'd give up a palace if I was a king
Because it's more than a palace
It's my everything
And there's a queen
Waiting there with a silver crown
In old shanty in old shanty town

I'd give up a palace if I was a king
Because it's more than a palace
It's my everything
And there's a queen 
Waiting there with a silver crown
In old shanty in old shanty town",In a Shanty in Old Shanty Town
Fats Domino,"[Chorus:]
Twas on the Isle of Capri
That I found her
Beneath the shade
Of an old walnut tree
Oh, I can still see
The flowers blooming around her
Where we met
On the Isle of Capri

She was as sweet
As the rose of the dawning
But somehow Fate
Hadn't meant her for me
And though I sailed
With the tide in the dawning,
Still my heart's
On the Isle of Capri

Summertime was nearly over
Blue Italian skies above
I said, lady, I'm a rover
Can you spare
A sweet word of love?

She whispered softly
It's best not to linger
Then as I kissed
Her hand I could see
She wore a plain golden ring
On her finger
So goodbye
To the Isle of Capri

[Chorus]",Isle of Capri

That's where I fell in love
When the stars above came out to play

Their thoughts ever stray
South of the border down Mexico way
She was a picture in old spanish lace
Just for a little while

I kissed the smile upon her face
For it was ""fiesta"" and we were so gay
South of the border down Mexico way
Then she sighed as she whispered ""manana""

Never dream that we were parting
And I lied as I whispered ""manana""
'Cause our tomorrow never came
South of the border I rode back one day

There in a veil of white by candlelight
She knelt to pray
But the mission bells told me
That I mustn't stay

In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her!

With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

And when you caught my eye my heart stood still

And I knew the spark of love was still burning

Fats Waller,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues

Just remember life is short
If you've got to take it
Take it easy

Take it easy
Go stick your chest out
And rest out
Of doors in the sun

If she makes you take it,

Fats Waller,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Take my advice, folks, and see Beale Street first!

You'll see pretty browns in beautiful gowns,
You'll see tailor-mades and hand-me-downs,
You'll meet honest men, and pick-pockets skilled,
You'll find that business never ceases 'til somebody gets killed!

If Beale Street could talk, if Beale Street could talk,

Married men would have to take their beds and walk,
Except one or two who never drink booze,
And the blind man on the corner singing ""Beale Street Blues!""

When you can travel for your health?
It' s spring, you hobo, sing,

And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

I wrap my arms around you so I can feel you breath

And he said:are you going my way, baby, can I take you there?

It was the first warm night spring, and love was everywhere. I didn't think twice as I jumped into his ride, streeetlights flashing by, as I whispered in his ear.

CHORUS:
Put the ride on cruise control, loose your drop top tune into that old school soul, baby, close your eyes and kiss me. Baby, make me loose control. She was so hot couldn't keep keep my eyes on the road, then she touched me.

Smooth ride down the road side underneath a starlit sky (I'm beside you).
Relax, sit back and enjoy the ride I'll put into auto drive are you down to be my boo?
Baby, we can take this anywhere you wanna go. 
Oh girl, tell me what you really like, there's no

Gently move it closer take it nice and slow. I couldn't resist such a sweet tender kiss, time stood still, it felt like perfect paradise.

Will you help me, see I don't know, where to start, to find the keys to win over a woman's heart.
Well first, things to remember when your game comes into play.
Gain your composure show respect and you'll be okay, because the ladies really like it when.
When you don't succeed, don't get offended.
Listen when she speaks and don't pretend.

[Chorus:]
Ooh ooh ooh. I like that girl. [2x]
Yeah she says that she like you, too, but she's too shy come and talk to you so.
Boy, you have to make that move if you want her to be yours.
[Verse 2:]
Show me a man that will be me, love.
Love me for me.
I'm not asking much.
See true love don't come easily and if it's meant to be, it happens natuarlly.
If you don't look for love, it might actually find you.
Now tell me what you want, what you need.
Cause I be thinking ya'll be bout diamonds, pretty necklaces nice cars, bling bling.
I thought ya'll made it clear, love don't' cost a thing.
Tell me if I'm wrong or right.
I don't want to make the same mistake I made before, she walked out the door cause her love I ignored.
I just want to take my time and explore her world cause, truth be told, I really like this girl.

[Chorus]

Now it don't matter the size of your bankroll.
Cause I'm an independent women, I can take care of my own.
I don't care bout your escalade or your sprees sitting on chrome.
Cause when it comes to a woman, you need a girl that you can take home.

[Last chorus:]
Ooh ooh ooh I like that girl. [2x]

You know, mommy, you're the best thing I ever seen come round my way and i.
Want you to be down with me like I'm with you, yes, you, girl.
You know you drive me crazy.
Ooh ooh yeah.
You got me saying, ooh ooh yeah.
You got me going, ooh ooh yeah.
You got me singing, ooh ooh yeah.
I'm feeling everything ya'll been talking bout.
And for her it's time for me to kick the player out.
With no doubt it's been running through my mind.
Settling down, true love I have found, my world she's forever my sunshine.
My pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, see, love is not about the material. but it's mental heartfelt
And spiritual.

I like that girl yeah [4x]
",Like That Girl
Fatty Koo,"[VALURE]
When I look into your eyes [x3]

[VERSE 1 (VALURE)]

something about the way you look at me, keeps me wonderin, could this be my destiny, maybe take a chance
At love again, claim you as my man, and spend eternity, with you as my king, sharing every dream,with love
And everything, hold onto me, don't ever leave me, no, keep me in your arms, don't let go

[CHORUS (GABRIELLE AND EDDIE B)]
They say, when you find love, then hold and treasure it, don't let it slip away, could this be love,
Cause it feels right but I'm afraid it might, just be lust

[VERSE 2 (RAP) (RON)]

could this be lust or love that I feel for ya, 'cause if it's not love tell you now wat's up, I don't wanna
Lead you on but it's too late, my intentions were to love you let's conversate, on the real I feel lust
Got the best of me, and I ain't mean to break ya heart, girl, seriously, I'm not sure if this love but
I'll stop frortin, it was a one night stand now we feelin suttin, and if love take ova it'll be alright,
It'll open up our eyes and give us insight, I wasn't planin to raise no family wit chu, but understand
This is real I just met chu, plus we just left the club and you tipsy, you wanna come to my hotel and freak
Me, when you look into my eyes tell me wat chu see, you see a playa from the love and you want me

[CHORUS (GABRIELLE AND EDDIE B)]

[VERSE 3 (EDDIE be AND VALURE)]

there's a old sayin, if you can't get the one you love, love the one you're with, but I'm not positive
That this will be one hundred percent.
I thought that you loved me, you made my heart believe.
I believed it, too, but you expect more than I can do.
But wat about the plans we made, why you gotta be this way??
I'm not sayin I'm not in love wit chu, but I'm not ready to commit so soon.
But it wasn't too soon, to take wat you need.
Don't drown in fantasies, cheak reality, I gotta be a man for me.

[CHORUS (GABRIELLE AND EDDIE B)]



",Lust
Fatty Koo,"This is it you know I had enough
I'm tired of you pushin' luck 
It's all the stupid things that you do 
That makes me so fed up with you (here we go)

Here you go talk talk talking again
Need to cut the act out cause its just pretend
What you say is not fair (no that ain't fair)
And if you know me better than you'll realize I don't care

But when you don't think (I don't care)
You do flawless things I'm just giving you fair warning
About the hurt and pain

I'm fine without caring don't try to scare me
Your words don't mean $hit to me so I won't let it get to me No

But who will be your friend that day when you fall
And when you need someone to talk to who can you call 

No I don't need nobody else but me and myself
Don't mean to seem selfish but I can't help it

What it all boils down to through all the hate she still loves you
Wait a minute the bottom line 
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right 
By the end of the damn day it's not about what you had to say 
She's you sister why can't you make up make the past be gone
So you can move on (Move on)

Stop listen up
No I ain't tryin to hear it now
So why am I wastin time if you being childish
We're just two women comersing so why are you so upset
Your not a women yet (Silly me how could I forget)
So what's the deal with you and your main friend (you wanna know)
When are you going to break it off with him 
It's over
Whatever
Go mind your own
I think it's best that I leave you (me) alone

What it all boils down to through all the hate she still loves you
Wait a minute the bottom line 
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right 
By the end of the damn day it's not about what you had to say 
She's you sister why can't you make up make the past be gone
So you can move on (Move on)

Can't stand the things you say (don't you ever shut up)
Choices that you make
Why do 
Why do you keep hating on me 
Girl your so clueless your foolish you don't understand
Oh you could never be me 
When will you understand I can't change who I am
You're to damn stubborn to receive hate 
So what
That's your problem
Oh well
Can I help you 
Please

What it all boils down to through all the hate she still loves you
Wait a minute the bottom line 
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Fatty Koo,"[Verse 1:]
Like a perfect ten in a magazine were the girls that caught my eyes
Sophisticated queen with the sex appeal
Beauty no less than a dime
But the girl that really caught my heart wasn't anything like that at first glance you wouldn't see it...
But she was really bad
-papasito, venconmigo
-dejame demostrar a ti
-que tu no puedes ver
-la mujer (marya-dentro) de mi

[Chorus:]
She's just an average girl
Ain't got no mink and pearls still she's like royalty
She's a princess in disguise
She's got a heart of gold
Within a tale untold, that's where her beauty lies
She's a princess in disguise
Her smile is like a twinkle in the sky
A diamond in the ruff with the heart of a child
Her true beauty is more then skin deep
Because the essence of a women is hidden underneath

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
-tomame al castillo que estan en los nubes
Hasme princesa de tu corazon, mi serviente de amor
Desde alli, viajar a otros lugares
Para vivir momentos inolvidables
You stole my heart and sealed it with a kiss
No matter where I look, it can't get no better than this
My princess, my goddess, you came from up above
I'll treat you like royalty, with all my love
Your heart is pure, together we explore
We build on honesty, one solid core
You caught my eye, I can't deny
You're in my heart, you are my pride

And in a chain reaction
I was down and calling for a place to hide

I saw a broken arm
Machines will all break down in the way I know
Mended and all made clean
I saw up on the screen all the stones I throw

It was a strange reaction
For someone like you to remain so sure
And in a chain reaction
I dissolve and break and then away I crawl
",Your Love Means Everything
Faultline,"I slipped away last night
Took me away from sight and the place I know
All crushed upon my skin
This mess I put you in and the punch I threw

It was a strange reaction
For someone like you to remain on side
And in a chain reaction
I was down and calling for a place to hide

I saw a broken arm
Machines will all break down in the way I know
Mended and all made clean
I saw up on the screen all the stones I throw

It was a strange reaction
For someone like you to remain so sure
And in a chain reaction
I dissolve and break and then away I crawl
And then away I crawl

And away I crawl
And away I crawl
And away I crawl

Faun,"Straßen aus Staub, langer Weg ohne Sinn
Aus dem Nichts in die Leere
Fremd und verloren, keiner sagt mir wohin
Wohin soll ich noch gehen

Vor den Toren der Welt werfe ich einen Blick
Auf die Freiheit, die uns stets umgarnt
Und ich lauf hinterher dem verlorenen Glück
Suche weiter nach dir jeden Tag

Bring mich nach Haus
Zu der Lichtung, wo wir uns einst trafen
Bring mich nach Haus
Wo die Bäume und Gärten erblühen

Doch dann erwacht aus dem Sehnen der Nacht
All die schmerzliche Wahrheit
Und meine Glut von den Träumen entfacht
Wird auf einen Schlag kalt",Bring Mich Nach Haus
Faun,"Diese Nacht ist kalt
Und der Wind der bläst
Durch unser Land
Und wer jetzt noch geht
Ist ein armer Tor
Oder auf Weg zu der Liebsten
Die jede Reise lohnt

Oh
Öffne mir, lass mich hinein
Dein Liebster steht im Mondenschein
Diese Nacht ist so kalt
So öffne mir
Denn morgen wird's zu spät sein

Mein Vater wacht über Haus und Hof
Meine Tür versperrt ein Eisenschloss
Und ich habe keinen Schlüssel dafür
Es führt heut' Nacht kein Weg zu mir

Oh
Öffne mir, lass mich hinein
Dein Liebster steht im Mondenschein
Diese Nacht ist so kalt
So öffne mir
Denn morgen wird's zu spät sein

Doch die Nacht ist so kalt

Endlich öffnet sie ihm
Und sie küsst ihres Liebsten kalte Stirn
Diese Nacht ist so kalt
Doch sie öffnet die Tür und er küsst sie
Sieben Mal dafür

Die Welt war uns verschneit.
Das Land war still,
Die Nächte lang,
Der Weg zu dir so weit.
Doch endlich kehrt das Leben zurück in unser Land.
Du trafst mich heut' im ersten Grün und nahmst mich bei der Hand.

Lass uns ziehen mit dem Wind,
Denn wohin er uns bringt,
Werden Zweifel zu Rauch,
Weil du hier bist.
Lass uns gehen und wir sind,
Endlich frei wie der Wind,
Wie die Vögel ziehen wir,
Weit übers Meer.

Im Winter noch da fragte ich wer mich im Fallen fängt.
Im Sommerwind nun fliegen wir bis an den Rand der Welt.
Und wer denn auf den Wegen mit uns gemeinsam zieht,
Den halten keine Fesseln, wenn der Wind im Sommer weht.

Lass uns ziehen mit dem Wind,
Denn wohin er uns bringt,
Werden Zweifel zu Rauch,
Weil du hier bist.
Lass uns gehen und wir sind
Endlich frei wie der Wind
Wie die Vögel ziehen wir
Weit übers Meer.

Einmal folg' ich ihrem Flug,
In das Land das in der Ferne ruft.
Lieder haben's mir erzählt.
Einmal hält mich nichts zurück,
Folge mir, begleite mich ein Stück.
Komm mit mir in jene Welt

Lass uns ziehen mit dem Wind,
Denn wohin er uns bringt,
Werden Zweifel zu Rauch,
Weil du hier bist.
Lass uns gehen und wir sind

Allein im Wald?

Dein Kleid ist schön,
Die Haut ist zart,

The lonely nights

But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,

Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,

And someone way down here loses someone dear.

Does it feel the same when she calls your name.

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted

Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Ces endroits qui faisaient taire le vacarme
De mes idées noires

Les sommets qui jouent les mâchoires
Et ta cage thoracique se resserre
Quand tu les regardes de haut en bas

Emmène-moi revoir juste pour un soir
Le vert fluo des rizières
Qui triomphèrent de ma colère
Et consolèrent mon désespoir

Emmène-moi revoir une dernière fois
Ces choses qui faisaient sauter
Mes pensées périmées

La poussière orange des sentiers
Le béton brûlant de Miami
Et puis aussi les gens
Qui dansent à Tivoli

La jungle urbaine de Port Royal
Sniper Alley et ses tramways
Qui domptaient ma part animale
Au mois d'avril et au mois de mai

Il faut vraiment qu'on reparte le plus vite possible
Parce que tu sais que là
Ça devient carrément insupportable

Il faut qu'on se noie encore une fois
Dans les nuits fauves
Et les grands soirs
Qu'on récupère un peu d'espoir

Qui me rendaient 100 fois meilleur",4.000 Îles

Fauve,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Cock Music Smart Music/Rag #1

Nothing's gonna change my world

Fauve,"Je sais même pas par où commencer en fait.
En même temps c'est la première fois que je fais ça,
Donc vous m'excuserez si ça part un peu dans tous les sens
Ou si je suis un peu trop confus.
Faut dire qu'en ce moment j'ai bien du mal à mettre mes idées au clair quand même.
J'ai bien du mal à trouver mes mots.
Enfin voilà, j'vous dresse le tableau vite fait
Je suis né dans une famille plutôt aisée, j'ai toujours été privilégié.
J'ai jamais manqué d'amour, ni de rien d'autre d'ailleurs,
Et même si ma mère, qui vient quand même d'un milieu assez populaire,
Était parfois un peu sévère avec mes frères et moi.
A l'école j'étais bon élève, à la maison j'étais poli.
J'me souviens pas avoir fait trop de conneries étant p'tit.
Par contre, j'ai fait des études correctes,
Et aujourd'hui je sais que mon parcourt est plus ou moins tracé.
Disons que je sais où j'arriverais si je continue sur ma lancé.
J'aurais probablement une femme et de beaux enfants,
Un crédit à payer, un épagneul anglais et un coupé-cabriolet.

Et pourtant vous voyez, ça fait maintenant presque 6 mois que je dors à peine,
Que j'peux n'rien bouffer pendant deux jours sans même m'en apercevoir.
Et quand j'me regarde dans le miroir j'y vois un mec bizarre,
Pâle, translucide, tellement livide, à faire sourire un génocide.
Docteur j'rigole pas, faut que vous fassiez quelque chose pour moi,
N'importe quoi, prenez un marteau et pétez-moi les doigts,
Je sais pas, parce que là je peux vraiment plus.
J'peux plus sortir dans la rue, j'peux plus mettre les pieds dans des bureaux.
De toute façon je suis devenu incapable de prendre le métro.
Ça pue la mort, ça pue la pisse, ça me rend claustro et agressif.
Et puis j'ai vraiment l'air d'un gland dans mon costard trop grand et mal taillé,
Que même si je voulais faire semblant y'aurait toujours marqué en gros ""troufion"" sur mon front.
Et puis tous ces gens qui cherchent absolument à s'entasser,
Qui poussent, qui suent, qui sifflent entre leurs dents comme des serpents.

""Vas-y du con, monte, monte, t'as raison""
De toute façon t'auras beau être le premier arrivé,
À la clef on va tous se taper la même journée scabreuse.
Les yeux collés à l'écran de l'ordinateur,
Tu te détruis les pupilles à lire en diagonal
Des choses auxquelles t'entraves que dalle.
""Non mais tu comprends, il est hyper important ce dossier,
Le client il raque 300 euros de l'heure, alors tu te débrouilles,
Tu vas chercher sur Google si il faut mais tu me finis ça pronto""
""Ah oui, vous avez parfaitement raison, oui.
C'est de ma faute, oui.
Je suis pas assez réactif.
Han c'est drôle, oui, collez-moi des gifles.
Connard, et si t'allais plutôt te carrer des poignées de porte dans le cul pour voir?""

J'en ai assez d'me taper à déjeuner des salades composées à 12 euros,
Ou de la barbaque en carton mouillé.
De manger sur un coin de table,
Puis de passer des après-midis minables à enculer les mouches,
Et finir par embrayer sur des after-works entre collègues.
Mais quel cafard, à croire qu'on aime tellement s'faire enfler la journée
Qu'on en redemande le soir.
Mais bon, faut dire aussi qu'on y rencontre des meufs,
Ou plutôt des célibattantes,
C'est-à-dire des nanas qui comme nous ont des problèmes affectifs.
On se présente, on leur raconte des cracks,
On leur dit qu'on est collab' alors qu'on est à la fac
Et qu'en vrai on passe notre temps à user nos culs sur des bancs trop étroits,
À écouter des types chauves déblatérer, déblatérer, déblatérer toute la journée,
Déblatérer sur tout, et surtout sur n'importe quoi.
Et heureusement, les journées se finissent toujours de la même façon
On rentre et on se fait beau pour la soirée,
On met nos polos cols relevés, puis on se retrouve au Q.G.
Pour picoler des demis à 5 euros.
D'ailleurs, quand on a un peu de plomb dans l'aile,
On a souvent envie de jouer aux rebelles et crier au tôlier
""Dit-donc tu t'prends pour qui enfoiré,
Tu trouves pas que ta bière elle est un peu chère?""
On le ferait si on avait un peu de cran dans nos artères,
Mais on préfère se taire et continuer à gaspiller notre tune,
À user notre salive pour pas grand chose, et à fumer comme des sapeurs,
Histoire de s'amocher à fond avant d'être vieux,
D'agrandir les valoches qu'on a déjà sous les yeux.
A part ça on parle surtout des filles qu'on a vu sur le net,
Et puis d'celles qu'on aimerait attraper en soirée,
Car ce soir, comme tous les soirs, on va essayer de niquer.
Mais surtout pas de faire l'amour, parce que l'amour, c'est pour les pédés.
Rien de bien choquant finalement.
Des gars parlent des filles qui baisent,
Des filles qui baisent pour dire qu'elles baisent.
La baise, on en garde toujours des regrets, parfois des maladies.
Au fond on fait ça sans plaisir, sans réelle envie.
C'est surtout pour ne plus penser.
Ça cache des plaies à vif, mais ça c'est un secret.
En vérité on est perdus, désœuvrés, désabusés, seuls comme des animaux blessés.
On est tristes et nos cœurs saignent,
Mais on se cache derrière nos grandes gueules et nos mots durs.
Entre nous on s'appelle mec, meuf, bâtard, baltringue, bitch, gouinnasse, connard,
Parce que sans le vouloir, les autres sont un combat permanent.
Décidément docteur, on vit une chouette époque, et dans une chouette ville aussi.
Paris, Paris la nécropole, Paris qui sent la carne,
Paris qui petit à petit entraîne dans sa chute des fragments de nos vies.
Paris c'est tellement sain, et nous sommes des gens biens,
Tellement biens qu'on est trop bien pour nos voisins,
Auxquels on prête pas plus d'attention qu'à la pisse derrière la cuvette des chiottes.
Parfois j'ai juste envie de hurler
""T'approche pas de moi, t'approche pas de moi,
Me touche pas, me touche pas, t'approche pas de moi!""
Docteur, il me faut un truc, n'importe quoi, sinon je vais craquer,
Je risque de cogner une vieille, un passant, un mioche.
Et ce sera moche, ce sera vraiment moche.",Sainte Anne

Quand je me demande ce que je fous ici
Et que je colle ma tête pendant
Des heures sur l'oreiller
Tétanisé, assommé, incapable de rien

J'en ai marre de faire semblant
J'en ai marre de faire comme si tout me glissait dessus
J'en peux plus d'entendre les sirènes
Même à travers le double vitrage

On prend les mêmes et on recommence
Je m'étais décidé à sortir parce que
Je supportais plus d'être chez moi
Je suis allé rejoindre des gens
Dans un de ces pubs irlandais merdiques
Qu'on trouve sur les grands boulevards

À une table sur ma gauche y avait un groupe de filles
Dont une qui m'a tout de suite plu
Elle était un peu mate de peau
Mais avec des cheveux châtains clairs
Ou blonds foncés je sais jamais

Mais surtout elle avait l'air douce
Bienveillante et sereine
Comme si elle avait pas renoncé
À rien, comme si elle avait jamais douté de la beauté du monde
Ni de celles des hommes

Je me suis fait quelques films
Osés mais jolis,
Restait tout de même à établir le contact
Ce qui est impossible à faire en réalité
On nous le fait croire dans les films
Mais c'est une vaste arnaque
Ça m'est retombé dessus d'un coup
Je me suis senti seul, triste et fatigué
J'y arrive pas sans toi,

Comment est ce que je vais faire ?

Que tu répares ma tête et mes sentiments
Qui fonctionnent plus bien
Que tu refasses mes stocks de sérotonines
Que tu me dises que c'est rien

Mais je me force à croire qu'avec du temps
Tu changes d'avis et dans mes nuits
Je rêve encore que tu m'emmènes danser
Jusqu'au matin

Sur la musique, on va on vient,
On s'éloigne et on revient
Puis tu t'élances et je te tiens
Je te retiens du bout des doigts
Pour te ramener contre moi

Sur la musique, on va on vient,
Corps contre corps, main dans la main
Plus rien n'existe, plus rien de rien
Quand je te tiens du bout des doigts

Le truc que je déteste
Envoyée par un genre de rugbyman pas très discret,
Un gars que je connaissais un peu

Alors ça va l'artiste?
Il me dit,
Les amours, tout ça?
D'ailleurs aux concerts tu dois bien te faire plaisir, mon salaud !
Le genre de choses qui met tout de suite super à l'aise,
Qui te rapproche encore un peu plus de l'eunuque dans son harem
Je lui réponds que ça,
C'est soit un mythe complet,
Soit c'est moi et mes petits camarades qui sommes des manches
Évidemment, il se met à me charrier,
Me dit que c'est pas possible,
Que j'ai un problème, que je suis pédé

Pauvre vieux, si tu savais combien de fois, je me suis posé la question,
Sincèrement qu'est-ce qui déconne chez moi ?
Pourquoi dès qu'il y en a une qui est gentille,
Je me barre en courant ?

Ça m'est retombé dessus d'un coup,
Je me suis senti seul, triste et fatigué
J'y arrive pas sans toi, j'arrive plus à encaisser
Comment est-ce que ça va se finir ?
Comment est-ce que je vais faire ?

J'ai besoin de toi comme d'une infirmière,
Que tu me dises que je suis hors de danger
Que mon état va s'améliorer
Que tu passes ta main dans mes cheveux,
Que tu prennes ma vie pour en faire
Quelque chose de mieux
J'ai compris que tu voulais pas de moi pour l'instant,
Mais je me force à croire qu'avec du temps
Tu changes d'avis, et dans mes nuits,
Je rêve encore que tu m'emmènes danser
Jusqu'au matin

Sur la musique, on va on vient,
On s'éloigne et on revient
Puis tu t'élances et je te tiens
Je te retiens du bout des doigts
Pour te ramener contre moi

Sur la musique, on va on vient,
Corps contre corps, main dans la main
Plus rien n'existe, plus rien de rien
Quand je te tiens du bout des doigts
Pour te ramener contre moi

J'ai besoin de toi comme d'une cigarette ou d'un verre
A chaque fois que je dois sortir dans la foule

Je me dis que ça peut pas être comme ça,
Qu'il doit y avoir autre chose
Jusqu'ici j'ai pas trouvé des tas de raisons d'exister
Mais j'ai besoin de croire en quelque chose de profond, de solide
J'ai besoin d'être porté par un espoir

Je voudrais faire l'effort permanent et sublime
Je voudrais être à tes côtés, simplement
Pour que la vie ne puisse jamais nous mettre à genoux

J'ai besoin de toi comme d'une infirmière,
Que tu m'aides à trouver le sommeil,
Qu'on se réveille dans des draps blancs
Que tu dises que c'était qu'un mauvais rêve,
Que tout ça c'est derrière moi maintenant
J'ai compris que tu voulais pas de moi pour l'instant,
Mais je me force à croire qu'avec du temps,
Tu changes d'avis, et dans mes nuits,
Je rêve encore que tu m'emmènes danser
Jusqu'au matin

Sur la musique, on va on vient,
On s'éloigne et on revient
Puis tu t'élances et je te tiens
Je te retiens du bout des doigts
Pour te ramener contre moi

Sur la musique, on va on vient,
Corps contre corps, main dans la main
Plus rien n'existe, plus rien de rien
Quand je te tiens du bout des doigts
Pour te ramener contre moi",Infirmière

Fauve,"Zoé, Zoé, aujourd'hui j'ai huit ans,
Les mots qu'on m'avait appris ont disparus,
J'ai du mal à faire des phrases construites comme il faut,
Mais pour une fois j'en ai pas envie,
C'est comme si mon esprit était à moitié éteint,
Qu'une partie était restée avec toi là-bas.
Le paysage défile par la fenêtre du train,
Qui nous emmène à nouveau et j'me dis,

C'est beau les plaines,
C'est beau le mois de juin,
C'était beau hier,
C'était beau ce matin,
C'est beau les filles quand les choses sont douces,
Sans violence ni dépit j'avais failli oublier depuis le temps.
Cette nuit à côté de toi c'était comme du lait,
Comme du coton qui m'a enveloppé de nulle part.
Si on me l'avait dit j'y aurais pas cru,
Alors j'me repasse le film en continu.
Les images de la veille se superposent au détail du wagon,
Elles flottent devant mes yeux comme sur la houle.

J'te revois perdue dans la foule
Avec tous ces mongoles bourrés qui dansent n'importe comment.
Et j'me revois moi essayant de t'atteindre en évitant les gens qui hurlent
Et font des grands gestes absurdes.
Et toi qui attend, terrorisée, au milieu du chaos,
Et puis tes joues et puis ta peau.

Et moi qui croyait que j'étais pas comme il fallait.
Qu'il fallait que j'tire une croix, qu'tu voulais plus, qu'tu voulais pas.
J'me suis perdu, j'ai bu la tasse,
Pour les bras d'une infirmière, j'me suis conduis comme une crasse.

Et moi qui croyait que j'étais pas comme il fallait.
Qu'il fallait que j'tire une croix, qu'tu voulais plus, qu'tu voulais pas.
Mais si tu m'jures, que tout ça c'est du passé,
Alors d'accord on tire un trait, on recommence à s'apprivoiser.

Zoé, Zoé, aujourd'hui j'ai huit ans,
Et j'voudrais qu'ça dure un peu,
J'écoute absolument pas ce qu'on me dit,
J'fais semblant d'être assis à mon siège,
Les gars m'parlent
Mais c'est comme si on était de part et d'autre d'une porte vitrée.
Je regarde le paysage défiler par la fenêtre du train
Qui nous emmène à nouveau,
Et j'me dis,

C'est beau les champs,
C'est beau le mois de juin,
C'était beau hier,
C'était beau ce matin,
C'est beau les filles quand y'a pas de peur, pas de dégoût pas de mépris.
Quand les choses sont limpides,
Cette nuit à côté de toi c'était comme une lueur dans les profondeurs.
J'me suis enfin senti reprendre des couleurs,
Si on me l'avait dit j'y aurais pas cru.
Alors j'me repasse le film en continu.
Les images de la dernière fois se superposent au détail du wagon,
Elles dansent par dessus le monde matériel.

J'te revois sur l'herbe au bord du fleuve,
J'revois la forme des nuages, les péages, les routes, les villages.
Et j'nous revois dans le nuit chaude tout à l'heure.
Le vent dans tes cheveux les lampadaires qui défilent en orange.
Et toi qui t'excuse en pleine rue,
Et puis tes larmes et puis tes bras.

Et moi qui croyait que j'étais pas comme il fallait.
Qu'il fallait que j'tire une croix, qu'tu voulais plus, qu'tu voulais pas.
J'me suis perdu, j'ai bu la tasse,
Pour les bras d'une infirmière, j'me suis conduis comme une crasse.

Et moi qui croyait que j'étais pas comme il fallait.
Qu'il fallait que j'tire une croix, qu'tu voulais plus, qu'tu voulais pas.
Mais si tu m'jures, que tout ça c'est du passé,
Alors d'accord on tire un trait, on recommence à s'apprivoiser.

Zoé, Zoé, aujourd'hui j'ai huit ans,
Et j'espère que toi aussi.
J't'imagine en train d'émerger doucement de cette nuit un peu courte,
Ton pas léger sur le béton nu.
J'croise deux doigts pour que tu sois comme moi,
Dans un état un peu second.
Et qu'tu regarde rêveuse les raild au loin,
En espérant voir passer le train qui nous emmène à nouveau et qu'tu t'dis,

C'est beau l'été,
C'est beau le mois de juin,
C'était beau hier,
C'était beau ce matin,
C'est beau les garçons quand ils sont gentils et droits,
Qu'ils sont vertueux même s'ils sont un peu maladroits
Cette nuit à ses côtés c'était spécial et nouveau,
Et moi qui pensait t'connaître j'me suis trompée.
Si on me l'avait dit j'y aurais pas cru.
Zoé j'espère que tu t'repasse le film en continu.
Que les images se superposent au détail de ta chambre,
Qu'elles flottent au dessus de ton lit défait.

Quand on a traversé la ville dans la chaleur naissante,
Et qu'sur le coup la crasse et la laideur ont parus presque supportables.

Zoé j'ai peur de souffrir comme toi,
J'suis plus habitué à ça.
Je sais pas où ça va nous mener
Mais j'crois qu'il faut qu'on s'donne les moyens d'être fixés.
Faut qu'on se revoit.

Et moi qui croyait que j'étais pas comme il fallait.
Qu'il fallait que j'tire une croix, qu'tu voulais plus, qu'tu voulais pas.
J'me suis perdu, j'ai bu la tasse,
Pour les bras d'une infirmière, j'me suis conduis comme une crasse.

Et moi qui croyait que j'étais pas comme il fallait.
Qu'il fallait que j'tire une croix, qu'tu voulais plus, qu'tu voulais pas.
Mais si tu m'jure, que tout ça c'est du passé,
Alors d'accord on tire un trait, on recommence à s'apprivoiser.",Lettre à Zoé
Fauve,"De ma fenêtre je vois les élèves du lycée Rodin
Qui sortent de cours en poussant des cris de joie,
Les garçons paradent, ils ont l’air plein de sève,
Et les leggings des filles serrent leurs jambes
Et leurs fesses encore fermes
J’aurais bien aimé connaître le lycée public
Apprendre la vie au bon moment
Être à l’aise un peu couillu et effronté faire ma puberté dans les temps
Piquer des trucs dans les supermarchés, perdre mon pucelage tôt,
Me prendre des droites et en redonner quelques-unes en retour sans m’écraser
Mais ça a pas été le cas non loin de là,
Moi j’étais plutôt de ceux qui rasent les murs
Qui font pas de vagues un genre de grenat
Un gentil petit collabo’ coincé du cul et peureux comme y’a pas
Qui fait tout bien comme on lui demande
Qui se lève tôt se couche tôt et travaille quand il faut
Mes parents m’ont pas forcé j’ai fait ça tout seul comme un grand
Puis je me suis obstiné durant des années
Forcement ça a fini par me jouer des tours
Depuis j’essaie de faire avec, j’essaie de faire dévier le sillon
Ce sera pas facile non,
Heureusement j'suis pas seul pour faire taire la voix qui me répète,

Tu seras lâche et impuissant,
Résigné, soumis, déprimant,
Insuffisant, pas adapté, spectateur dans le fossé,
Tu seras tout seul, divorcé, sans enfants, remarié,
Alcolo, adultère, fils indigne, mauvais frère
Tu seras amère, trop sévère
Malheureux toujours en colère
Méprisable, imbuvable, égoïste, insupportable,
Tu seras ce qu’on te dit, tu discutes pas,
Ici-bas c’est comme ça,
T’as compris le jeu p’tit merdeux?
C’est la roulette tu choisis pas.

Ah ouais tu crois ça?

Bah écoute, j'sais pas pour toi, mais pour moi ce sera,
La tête haute, un poing sur la table
Et l'autre en l'air, fais moi confiance
Avant de finir six pieds sous terre, j'aurais vécu tout c'qui a à vivre
J'aurais fait tout ce que j'peux faire
Tenter tout ce qui a à tenter
Et surtout j'aurais aimé

De ma fenêtre j'vois les gens qui partent au taff'
Y'en a qui ont fière allure avec leur beau manteau
Et leurs belles chaussures
D'autres au contraire ont l'air de ramasser sévère
Toutes celles et ceux qui s'en vont une fois de plus
Servir la soupe aux autres
Ma conscience de p'tit blanc me rattrape aussitôt
Tu vois, tu devrais arrêter de te plaindre
Mais pourtant je sais pas
Est-ce que c'est nous qui sommes devenu des baltringues
Est-ce que c'est le monde qui part en vrille
Parfois j'me dis qu'on nous a tellement habitué au goût de la culpabilité
Qu'on est devenu incapable d'y voir clair
Par exemple, moi pendant longtemps j'me suis acharné
À me ranger dans une boîte
À avoir une vie normale sans accro, sans risque, sans drame
Avoir un métier normal, un salaire normal,
Des sentiments normaux, une femme normale, une mort normale etc etc
Mais j'ai pas pu, c’était trop pour moi
J’étais pas assez endurant
Alors à la place j'ai chercher une feinte pour vivre dignement
Et aujourd'hui j'me saigne pour essayer d'aider les miens
La bonne façon d'agir
Selon des nobles fins
Et un jour enfin donner tord à cette voix qui me répète,

Tu seras dominant ou noyé
Écrasant ou écrasé
Carnassier ou dispensable
Gagnant ou donné négligeable
Tu seras semblable à tes semblables
Comme tout le monde, ou dégradable
Plus malin ou trou du cul
Tortionnaire ou corrompu
Tu seras battu et silencieux
Ou bien cruel, mais victorieux
Rigoureux ou inutile
Féroce ou détails futiles
Tu seras ce qu'on te dit tu discutes pas
Ici bas, c'est comme ça
T'as compris l'jeu petit merdeux
C'est la roulette, tu choisis pas

Ah ouais tu crois ça?

Bah écoute, j'sais pas pour toi, mais pour moi ce sera,
La tête haute, un poing sur la table
Et l'autre en l'air, fais moi confiance
Avant de finir six pieds sous terre,
J'aurais vécu tout c'qui a à vivre
Et j'aurais fait tout ce que j'peux faire
Tenté tout ce qui a à tenter
Et surtout, et surtout j'aurais aimé

De ma fenêtre j'vois un bout de l'enceinte de l’hôpital
Si je penche un peu la tête
J'peux peut-être arriver à voir le bâtiment des consultations
J'repense à toutes ces fois où on m'a dit,
T'es trop sensible
Mais ça va aller, fais pas cette tête
Bon OK, ce sera peut-être pas tous les jours la fête
Et le docteur de la tête qui me répète que c'est comme ça,
Qu'il faut que je l'accepte
Que c'est comme le diabète, qu'il faut vivre avec
Alors j'essaye chaque jour que Dieu fait
J'ai pas dit mon dernier mot t’inquiète
Y'a rien d’écrit, rien d’écrit
Et nique la voix qui m'dis,

Tu seras schizo', bipolaire, trop fragile, suicidaire
Tyrannique, incurable, repoussant
Pas regardable
Tu seras sadique, narcissique, voyeur, pervers
Égocentrique, destructeur
Dépressif, obsessionnel, compulsif
Tu seras damné, condamné
Étendu sur la chaussée
Déformé, mal branlé
Démoli, trois fois rejeté
Tu seras ce qu'on dit tu discutes pas
Ici bas, c'est comme ça
T'as compris l'jeu petit merdeux
C'est la roulette, tu choisis pas

Ah ouais tu crois ça?

Bah écoute, j'sais pas pour toi, mais pour moi ce sera,
La tête haute, les coudes sur la table
Le poing en l'air, fais moi confiance
Avant de finir six pieds sous terre,
J'aurais vécu tout c'qui a à vivre
Et j'aurais fait tout ce que j'peux faire
Tenté tout ce qui a à tenter
Et surtout on m'aura aimé.",Loterie
