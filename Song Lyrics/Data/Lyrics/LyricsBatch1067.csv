O.A.R.,"I look out below me the clouds on top the blue 
Kids thinking about nothing, cause there's 
Absolutely nothing to do. 
The door ain't wide just open, open to the sky 

On top the cage keep hopin', sayin cause on top 
The cage just try, on top the cage 
Help out your brother to the light at peace is a 
Helping hand 

With help from our mother we shine so bright and 
March to the father's land 
I said we take the spot and we take it up top and 
The key fits in the lock 

You come with me on this lifting walk, and you 
Know you never come back 
Because on top the cage is the harmony that bars 
And chains never chime 

Wherever we go it's not far for me, better befriend 
Old man time. 
I stood on top of this cage one night, all night long 
From here the view was proud 

I could see all these beautiful clouds 
So I told people come out of your cage 
Time to break lock forever 
Join together march on top hold my hand, say 

Goodbye to never 
You can be my man if you want to hang out here 
Just me and my girl on top of this world and we sit 
There and we stare 

At the clouds, green hills, and the mountaintops, 
And the river to the side 
You can come too, if you want, you don't have to hide",On Top the Cage
O.A.R.,"I woke today, felt another way,
Everything was gonna be fine.
My head rose up then my legs came too,
Quarter past nine was the time.

I used to lose floating memories, found myself
Wishing I'd remember old times.
But I woke today,
Felt another way,

Felt free in the sky to fly.
I stepped out the door, didn't know what for,
I saw my lady walking along.
I could have cried out what I wanted to say,

But I am sick of all this terrible charm.
I used to be into apologies, a regular to shame I 
Was shy.
But I woke today, 

Felt another way,
Felt free in the sky to fly.
Well I'm through the gate, got to my house about
A quarter to eight.

And I made a drink, got about an hour to relax and
Just think.
I'm just bored, nothing's ever gonna be the same
Anymore.

And with my drink in hand I got up to stand and I 
Was off to a regular day.
The morning dragged on, I was walking along,
Missing pieces fell to the ground.

Apparently, I could not see,
But I saw everything going down.
So I packed my bags and I was on my way,
I feel a little different in a different way.

But like I said when I got out of bed, I was off to a 
Regular day.
I could not hide, I wore my pride,
It felt good to be on the run.

The air quality was something new to me and I got
Along fine with the sun.
And when I rest my heard and I lay down to bed,
I put the pieces down with the blame.

And if all goes well, at the morning bell,
I'll wake feeling free just the same.
Well I'm through the gate, got to my house about
A quarter to eight.

And I made a drink, got about an hour to relax and
Just think.
I'm just bored, nothing's ever gonna be the same
Anymore.

And with my drink in hand I got up to stand and I 
Was off to a regular day.",So Moved On
O.A.R.,"Down the road there was a man walking, walking 
Knapsack round his back radio talking, talking 
And his blue suede shoes are covered in mud, but it no matter cause the boys on the run 
Black sunglasses and a bald head too, boy never had nowhere to run when it was cold, so cold 
So he hitched a ride to New Mexico, wanted to try for the big brass show 

But no 
He's the wanderer looking for his long lost home 
He's only got one place to go 
He's wandering and wondering when to go home 
He's not alone, not alone, not alone 
Feet been walking for a thousand years, trying to drive away those fears, but no 
Well then he picked up and then he went down south 
Dad said nothing and mom shut her mouth 
Well, he never thought too much, just thought he could heal with his touch 
For those who need help and more love 
And when love came around I heard the sound 
Wanderers wandering all round the town 

But no, they go 
He's the wanderer looking for his long lost home 
He's only got one place to go 
He's wandering and wondering when to go home 
He's not alone, not alone, not alone 
Hey, he's the wanderer looking for his long lost home 
He's only got one fine place to go 
He's wandering wondering when to go home 
He's not alone, not alone, not alone 
We wan wan wandered along, grabbed our friends and we move along 
We won won won the war, grabbed our friends and we ran for the door",The Wanderer
O.A.R.,"Amazing how we all want this life a little more everyday. 
It's crazy how we pick ourselves up just to let us down anyway. 
The one thing that you're missing is loungin' on the log right next to you. 
So pick up that precious something and relax for a delicate few.

The one time that you're loathing is there for you oh so well. 
So pick up that precious someone relax for a delicate spell. 

Rising up early the sun barely before me I could have sworn I just went to bed. 
I smell the blizzard in the air, Winter's bitter love affair. 
I grab my coat, my hat, my jacks...I put my hat on my head and I was off again as she said, 
Rising up early the sun barely before me, I could have sworn I just laid my head to bed about an 
hour ago. 

Blizzard in the air, Winter's bitter love affair, 
I grab my coat again, hat on my head, lit my jack and I was off again she said, 
Rising up early that sun rose barely before me, I could have sworn I just laid my head to bed. 
I've got to, but it was so cold, I've got trouble keeping hold of my lady sleeping next to me. 

But I swear today, I'm gonna go off in a delicate way and I'll have so much fun I swear. 
No matter what goes wrong, I'll be moving on, 
I promise you, jack in my mouth, hat on my head, and I was off again she said, 
Relax for a delicate few.

O.A.R.,"Well there was a time when life caught you by surprise.
What you see going by is a shadow.
You've got to live in front of your eyes.
In a typical way we stray, checking back with the past.
In a typical day we'll stay to see what's gonna last.
But I didn't mind at all.

I didn't mind at all
I didn't mind at all
I didn't mind at all

Well there was a place we'd chase through the woods in my juvenile days.
What a typical waste of space, what a wonderful place to stay.
But I could have cried but I just left my soul to fly.
And I could have chilled at will, but I didn't know how to die.
But I didn't mind at all.

I didn't mind at all
I didn't mind at all
I didn't mind at all

No, I've been woken, and I have been broken.
But this time it's gonna change
For,
I've been lazy, and I been crazy.
Has been stolen,
But from,
From this day on I swear to you true.
From this day on I swear to you.
Well there was at time when I could have flown out of the room.
Yet I didn't care just where I was going after noon. 
Though I didn't know and I chose to live my life so fair.
And I could have died, but I chose to live here instead
But I didn't mind at all.

I didn't mind at all
I didn't mind at all
I didn't mind at all

I've been woken, and I have been broken
But this time its gonna change
For, I've been lazy and I have been crazy
But this time it's not hazy at all
Cause I've been,
I've been chose my heart has been stolen
But from,
From this day on, I swear to you true.
From this day on, I swear to you true.
I say now way back when you and all your friends
Had some good times we should do this again we'd say
Hey, hey, hey we should do this again, we'd say.
But in the mean meanwhile, I'll just walk the mile.
I won't look back won't forget your smile
Oh no, hey hey hey we should do this again, we'd say.
But I swear to you true.
From this day on I swear to you true I swear I do I.

O.A.R.,"If only she knew
What was going right,
If only she knew,
I would not be alone tonight.
If only she knew
What was going wrong
If only she knew
I would not be singing this song.
If only she knew
What would I do?
Would I run?
Maybe stick around just for fun
Would I take you out just us two?
That would be grand
If only she knew

If only she knew what to do
Relax with you
And let myself get lost in your smile
Well I could lose it all for awhile
Oh my dear you know its true
I love you deep, if only you knew
Well I would give it all to you
Love you true if only you knew

O.A.R.,"It's been a long, long time since I lost myself.
Put my pride down on the table, put my fear on the shelf.
So I bought myself a throne to reside and let myself go.
But I've traveled much too far, where I've gone, I'll never know.

What a long, long time...
Long, long time.
It's been a little old while since I felt so fine.
Wanderin' in the rain...

Losing my mind.
What a long, long time.
What a long, long time.
My days I've spet relaxin' turned to nights relaxin' too

A thousand eyes upon me, but my sights are missing you.
So this time I swear I will loosen my grip.
On past times and bad lines and meaningless trips.
What a long, long time.

Long, long time.
It's been a little old while since I felt so fine.
Wanderin' in the rain,
Losing my mind.

What a long, long time.
What a long, long time.
So, over and over mile signs pass by my side
The more you try to find yourself, the more you tend to hide

Behind these - forest trees - and greens that blind your eyes
To lounge upon that throne I bought,
Confer there with the wise.
What a long, long time.

Long, long time.
It's been a little old while since I felt so fine.
Wanderin' in the rain,
Losing my mind.

What a long, long time,
Long time...yeah.
So here we appear, the rest lost themselves in a pit of fear.
For who? What can I do? But let them all come through the wall

And though some oppose, many of these things I know,
I'll stay here alone, and lose myself on the riverways of days.
I'm coming home.
What a long, long time.

Long, long time.
It's been a little old while since I felt so fine.
Wanderin' in the rain,
Losing my mind

O.A.R.,"It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed.
I got a lady running through my head
Ran out of money looking for a night shift.
It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed.

I know a lady way down in my country.
She was so pretty that my eyes threw disguises at me.
Now we will sit and we'll wonder about our future.
But now I'm thinking that today sounds fine to me.
Well I been working five days full time.
Ain't got no money, but everything is going fine.
Well, I been tired in my head.

It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed

Ran out of money looking for a night shift
It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed

I know this lady whose eyes fly right through me
And she will sit and stare directly at me. 
And that laugh will take me to my future. 
Throughout my past there is nothing left for me.
But I been working five days full time .
Ain't got no money but everything is going fine.

Ran out of money, looking for a night shift.
It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed.

I feel my lady late night she comes to me.
Invades my mind reminds me of where we should be.
So we just sit and we dream about our future.
Throughout my past there is nothing left for me.
But I've been thinking five days full time.
Ain't got no money, but everything is going fine.
But I've been tired in my head.
Well I am tired in my head.

It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed.
I got a lady running through my head.
Ran out of money, looking for a night shift.
It's three a.m. and I want to go to bed.
My lady won't leave my head.
I just want to rest my head to bed.
She won't let me go.
I don't want to go.

O.A.R.,"He walks these streets some nights until way past twelve.
His mind can't decide if he's in heaven...he just can't tell.
He sees her standing there, smiling by the lamp post shine.
His heart can't remember ever feeling, oh, so fine.
She gone.
She not coming back, no way.
She gone.
She not coming back to stay.
She gone.

And as she turns away his eyes lost in her back.
His feet continue down some ancient railroad track.
And right then, right there he sees that he's done wrong.
And as he opens his eyes, realizes that she gone.

Well, she gone, she not coming back, no way.
She gone, she not coming back to stay.
Well, she gone, she never coming back again.
She gone, what's he gonna do 'til then?
She gone.
She gone.
She gone.
She gone so far away.

O.A.R.,"I was riding down the highway when I thought I 
Spotted someone in the road
I said, ""You going my way?""
And he turned his head and said, ""Man, I don't know.""
So I asked about his government and he turned his head and then began to laugh
And I asked him, ""what you running from?""
And he said, ""My man, I'm running from my past.""
And we laughed aloud, and sang aloud
And then we drank a brew

I didn't think a thought about Mr. Brown, he's through.
I heard the loud, marching sound, of a revolution coming through.
There's no need to come around unless you're true.
Someone in the road.
Well we kept on driving down that road for about an hour and half.
The way that we were moving left half myself
Reflecting in the past
Tired of endless talking, stopped the car and
Started walking down a path.

Lifted spirits to my heart,
Lord knows that anger never lasts.
And we laughed aloud, and sang aloud
And then we drank a brew

O.A.R.,"Peter sat on a mountain top.
Northern wind blows through his hair all day long.
Peter never took no time for him to stop.
Just stood right there and he stared.
Singing, oh.

He don't need us anymore, 
Cause his life is just too good.
He'll be living everyday 
And loving like we could.
And that's Peter's song.

Have you ever known a boy, lonely as could be?
A lifetime ago he was a child of the free.
So here he stand alone crying at the sea.
It listens, and moves, and holds him.
Singing, oh.

He don't need us anymore, 
Cause life is just too good.
He'll be living everyday, 
And loving like we could.
and that's Peter's song.

Late one day on the mountaintop 
Peter swept down the side.
He'd been waiting all his life 
For one more chance to ride.
But the Sun said, ""Son, don't you 
Come around up here anymore.""
So Peter topped on his hat 
And head to the west shore.
Singing Ladanday.

Have you ever known a boy lonely as can be?
Lifetimes away we were children of the sea.
And if the Sun and Moon come through
Freedom is a giude.
Hoping that one day we will all try.

A better view of you.

And lay down for awhile.
And let life catch your eye.

And living mirrors love.

O.A.R.,"In a way, I need a change
From this burnout scene
Another time, another town
Another everything
But it's always back to you

Stumble out, in the night
From the pouring rain
Made the block, sat and thought
There's more I need
It's always back to you

But I'm good without ya
Yeah, I'm good without you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

How many times can I break till I shatter?
Over the line can't define what I'm after
I always turn the car around

Give me a break let me make my own pattern
All that it takes is some time but I'm shattered
I always turn the car around

I had no idea that the night
Would take so damn long
Took it out, on the street
While the rain still falls
Push me back to you

But I'm good without ya
Yeah, I'm good without you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

How many times can I break till I shatter?
Over the line can't define what I'm after
I always turn the car around

Give me a break let me make my own pattern
All that it takes is some time but I'm shattered
I always turn the car around

Give it up, give it up, baby
Give it up, give it up, now
Now

How many times can I break till I shatter?
Over the line can't define what I'm after
I always turn the car around

All that I feel is the realness I'm faking
Taking my time but it's time that I'm wasting
Always turn the car around

How many times can I break till I shatter?
Over the line can't define what I'm after
I always turn the car around

Don't wanna turn that car around

O.A.R.,"Are you low?

Can't believe this is real, somethings got to change
Got to live my life, but I love to be strange

Got to slow it down

Man I miss my dog
My dog know I miss him to
But I feel it man
I feel them all in my heart
I know you right here, right with me
Man just riding on with his niggas
You heard me, I miss a lot of people
They know I miss them to
Look

[Verse One]
Nigga took care for my heart
When they killed my dog
Ruined every last dream that we had to ball
Me and this nigga was like brothers
Since we was small
I needed anything he was the first I'd call
He was down the road with me
If I got in beef
By fucking them hoes with me
He was H-O-T
Kept it real and representing
Via-13 got a little girl
I treat like it's for me
and a lot of hoes conversation
It's B.G and L.T.
Never had a friend like him
He never had a friend like me
Snorted half a grand of dope
On the flight together
Broke trying to make all night together
Now Lil' Ten gon' be a part
Of my life forever
Wish Lord wouldn't of took you to rest you
Look me and my dog broke bread together
Hot, fucking hoes in the same bed together

[Chorus]
Of top, it's all gravy, you in six feet
Just remember I love you, so Rest In Peace
I still can't believe you left out here solo
I'm doing the damn thing for me and you both
Off top, it's all gravy, you in six fett
But remember I love you, so Rest In Peace
I still can't believe you left me out here solo
But I'm fucking hoes for me and you both

[Verse Two]
1997, November I had bad days in my life
It looked like that was the worst
Niggas shot my round like a dog
Left him for dead
Chest bust wide open
Non-stop he blead
Just the day before we talked about gettin sober
In the blink of an eye
My whodi life is over
I know there's a good reason
Why the good Lord chose you
I know when your at your real
Cause down here you was a soldier
Always said ""Do it, it can't be faded""
Always said ""Do it you gon' make it""
And I made It
I wish you were here to see
It's all gravy, I know you want me to let that be
Man I hate it
I know you don't want me to be weak
So when I sheine, you shine
It's off the T-O-P
You was the Livin' Legend in the UPT
Do me a favor you and my daddy look down on me

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
You should see I'm balling out of control
I just got a deal with Cotsh for six zeros
And I had to be heavenly baby and niggas was hoes
They wasn't playin the game
Hot Gold, it's over, it's cool
I'm a gangsta in the game I know the street rules
And I miss all my people that's resting in peace
And I miss all my people that's six feet deep
You heard me

[Chorus]

Believe that
You know I'm holding it down ya heard me
Man I miss you with a passion dog

Fuck who that I offend, rappers sit back I'm bout to begin
Bout foul talk you sqwak, never even walked the walk
More less destined to get tested, never been arrested
My album will manifest many things that I saw did or heard about 
Or told first hand, never word of mouth
What's in the future for the fusion in the changer?
Rappers are in danger, who will use wits to be a remainder
When the missile is aimed, to blow you out of the frame
Some will keep their limbs and, some will be maimed
The same suckers with the gab about, killer instincts
But turned bitch and knowin' damn well they lack
In this division the connoisseur, crackin' your head with a 4 by 4
Realize sucka, I be the comin' like Noah
Always sendin' you down, perpetratin' facadin' what you consider
A image, to me this is, just a scrimmage
I'm feel I'm stone, not cause I bop or wear my cap cocked
The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock
Those who pose lyrical but really ain't true I feel

Their time's limited, hard rocks too

Speakin' in tongues, about what you did but you never done it
Admit you bit it cause the next man gained platinum behind it
I find it ironic, so I researched and analyzed
Most write about stuff they fantasized
I'm fed up with the bull, on this focus of weed and clips
And glocks gettin' cocked, and wax not bein' flipped
It's the same old same old just strain it from the anal
The contact, is not com-pexed or vexed
So why you puhsin' it?  Why you lyin' for?  I know where you live
I know your folks, you was a sucka as a kid
Your persona's drama, that you acquired in high school in actin' class
Your whole aura is plexi-glass
What's-her-face told me you shot this kid last week in the park
That's a lie, you was in church with your moms
See I know yo, slow your roll, give a good to go
Guys be lackin' in this thing called rappin' just for dough
Of course we gotta pay rent, so money connects, but uh
I'd rather be broke and have a whole lot of respect
It's the principal of it, I get a rush when I bust
Some dope lines oral, that maybe somebody'll quote
That's what I consider real, in this field of music
Instead of puttin' brain cells to work they abuse it
Non-conceptual, non-exceptional
Everybody's either crime-related or sexual
I'm here to make a difference, besides all the riffin'
The traps are not stickin', rappers stop flippin'
For those who pose lyrical but really ain't true I feel

Their time's limited, hard rocks too",Time's Up [Bare Bone Radio]
O.C.,"You lack the minerals and vitamins, irons and the niacin
Fuck who that I offend, rappers sit back I'm bout to begin
bout foul talk you sqwak, never even walked the walk
More less destined to get tested, never been arrested
My album will manifest many things that I saw did or heard about 
or told first hand, never word of mouth
What's in the future for the fusion in the changer?
Rappers are in danger, who will use wits to be a remainder
When the missile is aimed, to blow you out of the frame
Some will keep their limbs and, some will be maimed
The same suckers with the gab about, killer instincts
but turned bitch and knowin damn well they lack
In this division the conniseur, crackin your head with a 4 by 4
Realize sucka, I be the comin like Noah
Always sendin you down, perpetratin facadin what you consider
a image, to me this is, just a scrimmage
I'm feel I'm stone, not cause I bop or wear my cap cocked
The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock
Those who pose lyrical but really ain't true I feel

""Their time's limited, hard rocks too""

Speakin in tongues, about what you did but you never done it
Admit you bit it cause the next man gained platinum behind it
I find it ironic, so I researched and analyzed
Most write about stuff they fantasized
I'm fed up with the bull, on this focus of weed and clips
and glocks gettin cocked, and wax not bein flipped
It's the same old same old just strain it from the anal
The contact, is not com-pexed or vexed
So why you puhsin it?  Why you lyin for?  I know where you live
I know your folks, you was a sucka as a kid
Your persona's drama, that you acquired in high school in actin class
Your whole aura is plexi-glass
What's-her-face told me you shot this kid last week in the park
That's a lie, you was in church with your moms
See I know yo, slow your roll, give a good to go
Guys be lackin in this thing called rappin just for dough
Of course we gotta pay rent, so money connects, but uhh

O.C.,"Like the dead end kids, we used to play in the streets
Never worryin' about grief, football spelled relief
Ronnie was the coach for us
See he taught us to play, almost every single day, OK
Now on Evergreen was Larry and Mike and Lon
My cousin Boo lived there too just to name a few
With Sha-rone, he's bad to the bone, Boo's little sidekick
And a bad ass mouth, he used to feist it on Harmon Street
With Zach, Leo and Ed
Me Jody and Boop by June, Rocky and then comes
Tommy and Cedric, Lamont and Greg, unique in our own right
At times we'd fight, but that's a-ight
Still, not realizin' we had love, it showed
When we played, no phony charades against
One another, now while I write this song
It's like some are still alive and a couple are gone

[Chorus]
We're born to live, a life to die
Life's so damn short and I wonder why
We're born to live, a life to die
Life's so damn short and I wonder why
We're born to live, a life to die
Life's so damn short and I wonder why
We're born to live, a life to die
Life's so damn short and I wonder why

As kids, you're overlookin' death
It didn't seem important or serious, it just seems curious
It was about, wakin' to a bowl of cereal
Cartoons on Saturday's, karate flicks, and like
Ridin' your skateboard, or bicycle
And went as deep as Killa Joe on the corner drinkin' Ripple
Plus, Puerto Rican kids on the block were cool
We got along, we all knew right from wrong
By far, we got a dose that life was hard
A Spanish we were close with, was killed by a car
Shocking, Alberto was hit, on the block and
Death was spontaneous, his moms was clockin' him 'cross the street
He just received an award
For Little League baseball like an hour before, plus
He didn't even get to see the summer set in
Dyin' all young at the age of seven
It opened up my eyes small that the flesh was weak
As a kid, thinkin' shit like that was mad deep, peep it

[Chorus]

Now when somebody is gone, that's when you realize how close you was
How close you are, like a star
Real deep it takes time to heal
And still from time to time you wish you could find the way to forgive
And let him know you forgave
But they can't feel six feet deep inside the grave
What's left, but attend his wake, believin' if it was you
He'd do it for old time's sake, damn
I'm disturbed, by the news when I was told I was sittin'
Knowin' damn well Boo ain't bullshittin'
My life flashed like big bills of cash
And good times we had, now it's all so sad
One of my childhood pals hit the road
When you take, to the streets, then you die, by the code
But in this case, who knows what went down?
Bottom line is wishin' that he still was around
Now he found a spot in my heart, or should I say lobotomy
Mike, know you're trapped inside of me
And every other brother in Bush wick
Who rushed to your side thick, all down with the click
Yeah, God Bless he laid to rest
Call him Mike Boogie, that's what describes the nigga best

""Police be clocking me"" -> KRS-One - Hip Hop vs Rap

[Verse 1]
I make wax, I pay tax, I don't show cracks
Something to kick back, you callin' on dispatch
The deal you'd did with a dealer you the distel
Took Gladys from his box now he's burried in the system
You see me comin' out of my building
All types of days and nights, wondering if I got a nine to five
Those I always do, so you cry I spy
A flashin' goes smile, you in the corner of my eye
Walkin' I feel the hawk over right the side
It's over from the act, lyricist start to walk live
Shop lift or what, then I start to jog
Hearin' speed accelerated from the J-8's car
The sirens sound violent they expect more not ready
I'm on the stoop my man named Little Eddy we started laughing
He's nextdoor from me, is a house that has traffic like drugs are free
But I'm a new face in a new place of a melon race
Gets black in 'em makes a good fellon case
And that's not so and I get mad cause everywhere I go
Long as I'm dark walkin clarks in my village tho

""Police be clocking me"" -> KRS-One - Hip Hop vs Rap (8X)

[Verse 2]
They clocking, shocking and knocking me
Wantin' a reason for whocking me
But I ain't committin' no crime
Soon as they stoppin me O.C. roll if a dolo went solo
Cop car come screechin in my presence in a second yellin ""Freeze!""
I'm scared how can I stop hopped over a fence
Runnin' frantic sendin' O.C. into a panic
I 'fused to be rock me hardly you won't scar me beatin' me down
Yellin' smellin old and coffee sender
Fuckin' hard, but soft to a stick
Some cops are cool and some are just downright dicks
You won't in 68 me in a choke hole, death mockin' me
So for that even my dousin keep clockin me
Check my abdominal check how I'm fashion
Nice sticks if you don't had the same type of fashion
Two blocks behind me two jakes who want blue and white
Pair glocks equals 32 shots I think not

""Police be clocking me"" -> KRS-One - Hip Hop vs Rap (8X)

[Verse 3]
What for!? Is it my be	-Boy presence mixed with mature
Is it the way Stone and me comb the city in a Benz
Legitimate plus without ends
Paperwork was right, we sat aside a red light
Givin' dirty looks, I guess assumin' we were crooks
Scopin' the car, tags of the par, rims shinin' in ya face
With the tires all along and I dig it
All young is my complection been through gettin' stress
So I know you understand what I manifest
A friend of me, uncool, that squares a black cop Jones
All crooked with fat rides and homes
Watch your own BB with the APP on your side
And corrupt cats corriscatin on the margin
Next time read me my rights check out the snipes
Look behind ya on the wall sucker I rocks mics

O.C.,"It's like many knuckleheads who want to do the eye to eye contact 
Not knowing O.C. is ready for combat 
I tried to ignore the son with the advacant attitude 
Stick in my face for gratitude  yeah 
Just the other night on the train 
Me my cousin Boo was on our way up to club Galaloo 
I kind of had a fight so we took our 25's and that 
We had juice with the bouncer on the inside 
Mad Jamaicans faking nigga fronting knowing they're Americans 
We fronted us off from the embarrassing 
Some old poor face fellow try to star me in the eye and give a wammy 
He almost caught a grammy 
Just when I was about to reach for my glock 
 Boo whispered to me yo! 
""O O let it slide"" 
It ain't worth smoking a minute worth of lead 
So to break the tension I 
Broke him in the head 

I let it slide, I let it slip on by 
Giving you one last try to kill it with the eye 
New day same shit occurred in this time 
I was asked what I was looking at not knowing he was grassed 
This spark the beef and 
I was gonna finish it off but turns out 
This nigga was soft he got 
Afraid from the way about the stance glancing to my left and right 
Put a basket a man insight 
He'll see the whole thing if I decide to do a buckwild move 
So what I turn it in shall I choose, ha! 
Fire my steel and take the chance 
Of being bagged and ship up north for a long long ? 
I ain't for it so I flash the cloud 
He saw the nickle plate 
Almost having a day to die 
I wonder why 
Chumps want to pick on I 
They be like setting it off 
And I be letting it slide 
I don't know what they be seeing 
But one time in a conflict 
I flip, turn into an unstable human being 

I let it slide, I let it slip on by 
Giving you one last try to kill it with the eye 

When I'm flowing with my girl I feel it the most 
Beef coming so close like a champagne toast 
On the train, in the city, down the way 
Down her way, I take it upon myself and say niggas is gay 
What you trying to prove? 
Can't move him out and with a stare 
But when a brother pull a trunk and sink it ain't fair 
Two wrongs don't make a right 
But the philosophy of a fight, fella 
Used to prolong you life, I 
Rolled like it was enemy 
Why would you pretend to be 
Some motherfucker men is to fight to kill Kenney, I 
Be rappin' son's trying flamboyant and 
Put on a smurf 'cause you staring is annoying and 
No matter how much I try to avoid noise from feeling in with bad day 
Starring in my grill again 
Or try to hypnotize with the eye starring 
Retinified be tearsful, to your family lives a day 
No fronting because you couldn't stop my glock so 
Time ran out 'cause you punch your own glock 

I let it slide, I let it slip on by 
Giving you one last try to kill it with the eye",Let It Slide
O.C.,"I say one for the fam, two for good judgment
Bad luck to trife, good luck to stay above it
Trial and error, O.C.'s out to sever
Your game respect neglect not
You work hard for the revenue instead of on the avenue, babblin
I'd rather be accomplishin, makin moves, travellin
Insight is right on time let's do it
Funk struck again with the disco fluid
I protrude out of your skin like thorns irritatin MC's
Cause they don't make, songs like these
Mister, it's the man most lease to excel
Long time ago, many thought I'd fall like a domino, no
Now your face is chump, cause I've summed up
The somethin most high, not a mountain to a bum

I'm comin with fluent, rhythm, calm yet storm
Unleashin my speech to each and every one
I wake up in the mornin, get up then I'm yawnin
Glad to be alive to another day's dawnin
Some blessed be otherwise, they despise
Cause they can't handle what's word from the wise
I don't stress who I measure up to or who's fond of O's
Cause what you build I knock down for my condos
Upon those, those words I speak
More or less my best, just to say the least
Foundation laid, what gives
You ask would I sass regardless, O.C. lives

One time, it's a check your life record
Yeah peep the method it's a smooth kind of effort
With guidelines to put your hand on your chin and think
Ears listen before you say a record ain't mink
Hard work involves what evolves around O
I try to keep it moderate if that's how I thought of it
I break beats down lashin, with the voice
Choice words I'ma say, only spoken when I'm moist
It's a vibe, coincidin with the rhythm
Choice words to follow, for suckers to swallow
Each one teach, strong not week
So I'ma let mom finish what I started to freak, it's like..",Ma Dukes

Take me in stride, O.C.'s worth listening
Watch the tricks of a hoe who is a fixin
Tender eyes, they only leadin' to a hard-on
Touchin' tongue stick, two to be a part on

So many ways to flip phrases, flip thoughts
Passin' licks over the head of my foes
Fits I'm givin' 'em it's a living
If I don't want to take a ride with ya
Then I can't be driven
Bound for town with a raw sound
Seemin' to be lackin' lust in front, my line of MC's
Skits get done by the misfit
Doin' gimmicky shit, followin' the leader from a trend hit
O.C. got it goin' so like a sweater
Better believe it, that I get it busy to the letter
Pure and thick, that's so premature ejaculated
And if you had a girl you wouldn't be masturbatin'
Masceradin' your personafication as a lyrical law
When you just not fascinatin'

Poetically astoundin', round and soundin'
My brain was paused to a beat, boomin' and bouncin'
Edo waves kickin' with the kicks asided
You must go inside and exhail, divide it

[Chorus: x2]

Crushin' competition, dustin' oppostions
Down the toilet on a flushing composition
Describes a week, and for I can speak
Myself against the man, with the true mystique I got
So many ways to flip phrases, flip thoughts
Passin' licks over the head of my foes
Fits I'm givin' 'em it's a living
If I don't want to take a ride with ya
Then I can't be driven
Bound for town with a raw sound
Seemin' to be lackin' lust in front, my line of MC's
Skits get done by the misfit
Doin' gimmicky shit, followin' the leader from a trend hit
O.C. got it goin' so like a sweater
Better believe it, that I get it busy to the letter
Pure and thick, that's so premature ejaculated
And if you had a girl you wouldn't be masturbatin'
Masceradin' your personafication as a lyrical law
When you just not fascinatin'
Nigga, you need to stop flexin' stop vexin' what you not
And sure 'bout what you got

O.C.,"CHORUS:

We just can't go wrong
You got me hypnotized, mesmorized (mesmorized)

What you want, I shoot a line, thinkin maybe we can talk, cause
The first time I laid eyes on you, boo
I seen into the future, you and I true blue, huh
High school, eleventh grad, my-my you fly
I was struck, you gave a go, we took it slow
Every Friday you mad it my day, comin to know
You was pure inside out, and not just a ho
Oh my god, my folks takin to you, now it's official
If other girls would call the crib, my mommy she would blow the whistle
I'ma, past the fatuation love is in effect, now
What you call sex, I say 'yo baby I'm stressed out'
We hooked a bond that's so strong knowin

CHORUS (3x) [verse 2 cuts in]

Many years in the mix now
We get a crib together, our love is tough as leather
Always by your side like a shadow, but not narrow
You be like my queen, OC I'll be your pharoahe
Handle each other with care, we're
Inseperable, none come second to you
We imbelish in trust, we might fuss and cuss
Cause we're like stainless steel baby, we can never rust
Blessed with God, for grantin my soulmate to life
Commonlaw, 9 years, you officially my wife, ooh
Do what you want, I don't worry bout fools
Cause I know know it's me you're comin home to, true
Teenage love turned into somethin strong knowin

CHORUS (3x)

Always and forever, forever always
So much temptation but I don't pickup strays
Case in fact, I'd rather be many a groupies
Lookin fine like I realized they just floosies
Toured the world from Amsterdam to Japan
Shot at me on tour, hooker tried to play a man, now
Thought about my girl, my moms and my pops
If it wasn't for the cops I'd be layin in a box
Dyin in vain, causin whole lotta pain
Tombstone mighta read 'Gave it what all for the fame'
And when I'm away call my woman every day
I figure why fuck up a good thing over one night's lay, I say
Gettin past all the sour times we had
From others intervening talkin nothing but trash, but
We got a bond that's so strong knowin

CHORUS [fades until end]",Can't Go Wrong
O.C.,"Yeah
Mmmm

Echoes in the halls yes, when I arrive on the set - what?
Blessin all that came to see me rock my cut
Such a man like me receivin attention must be chosen
like a bangin body chickenhead, posin for a flick
Flashbulbs poppin in the air
Floatin the stage, I'm movin like a black Fred Astaire - smooth
The momentum of the bass and treble, levels on point
Bonus to ride, the microphone
it's O.C. slash, Mush shine communicatin for the masses
Puttin my finger against NASA
When I die, bronze my mic, preserve it for newcomers
to visit my gravesite like a shrine
Rappers'll line up faithfully, just to get
a handful of dirt from the plot occupied by

Chorus:

The Chosen One, beyond the Moet and the Cristal
The Son of a King and a Queen, I'm a gifted child
All bow to me like the image of God, Supreme Being
Get you to the eyes worth seeing

Influenced; but not by the ancient ruins of rap
A large percent of y'all fell into a trap
Trendsetter share with y'all a veteran's nightmare
Not for you to follow it but try and stand clear, bust it
Bein intelligent, means you a sucka
Bein wild as hell, means you a smart motherfucker WRONG
Analyze songs nowadays
Most rappers gunsprayed or hustled from night to day - fiction
I deciphered lots of rhymes, only to find
false info, just to see what it meant to Oh
Not for-real; no skill MC's
Mostly all under twenty, and I find it funny
That's why the seed was born to lead assume
positions like Noah, all aboard the arc with

Chorus: repeat 2X

I'm comin from an Egyptian Mola story, rarely told
Back in the mix of things to break the mold
Good as gold mind ya leave negative thoughts behind ya
Type of how I'm livin be more potency than ganja
Oh Period; when you see my face I'm serious
Move with the mystique of a cheetah, mysterious
Dominate jungles when I walk the floor rumbles
The baddest motherfuckers - I make their attitudes humble
My aura shine bright like sunlight, in Farenheight temperature
Stylee's, you file these
Most is type of scriptures, follow me is for reference
Other MC's make no kind of sense
Oh freeze foes and bleed souls and leave those stunned
Descended on the planet, you're in confusion
Pick ten, subtract five then, subtract four
Watch the Sun leave a shadow on the man that's raw
I be

The Chosen One",The Chosen One
O.C.,"Check out the scheme of a dream, thick fog all around me
Standing in a tunnel of blood, hounds surround me
Shadow of a child, my eyes visualize and figure
And as you walked backwards the shadow grew bigger
Temptation made me curios to follow it
All fear in my heart, at that point I done swallowed it
State like trance as I reach out my hand
You wore an overcoat robe, face was disclosed
Now was this a dream or reality
I was about to become one of Satan's fuckin fatalities
In silence, I hear the wings of a black crow flappin
The bird lands, then appears a man
Very sleek in physique, stood  about six feet
Dispute was jet black I had to step back
His dimeanor wasn't pure, I knew this for sure
He had a diseased look that the world couldn't cure
I'm forzen, the fear returned to my body
Heart pumpin so fast, I thought I was goin into cardiac arrest
I wake up in a cold sweat, wifey sleepin on my left sound asleep
I peep around the room then I make a sudden jest
A feather from a black crow was beside my pillow
Was it a sign from God to repute for the things that I did in my lifetime
Now my soul's on the line
I'm puzzled, spark up a Newport
Then I take a fall in hell it's the cancer
Then I try and find an answer

CHORUS: (2x)

My wisdom that I'm droppin is-
Is somethin like a doctor and
Necessary like oxygen
I'm seein who's my opposite
And who's my aid in life
So let's attract and repell
Third rate government they tryin to seize the world

Day like a rose, the wind is blowin hard against the window
Pull up the blinds there sits the crow
I back up fast heart beatin massive
Lost my breath, collapsin fallin on the mattress
I went into a state of unconsciousness
Open my eyes up, I'm layin on the dark street
Leaves blowin in the breezes, Jesus
I on the street like a nightmare
I take flight, a bird through the air
While I'm wingin it I see all sorts of chaos
Dead bodies, burned buildings turned over cars
Uh-uh, seein visions of an all out war
Territory factors, picture escape from New York
Gun fire, blomb flowin, nerve gas a-flowin
Just imagine whole race of Harlem gaurds showin
Realizin I was havin out-of-body experience
Return to my physical and wake up tense
Layin in the hospital as I figured the riddle
G-O-D was throwin at me paranormally so
Givin sight beyond sight about the world we know

My lyrical energy bring out envy in most MC's 
Who listen to O, he didn't know me before

That's a crime to be dealth with but we take it to trial 
Verdict is in, the judge know my beef has cause 
""One thing I do is keep em different, and far from yours""

He's no average MC, with a smile on his face 
And though you try to bite his style, no one can duplicate 
He can flow anywhere ya want, he can rhyme any time you say 
And he's never ever ever too far, from tomorrow, today

You may never find a MC well orchestrated like a symphony 
Some'll go down in history, some in infamy 
The infamy will be somewhat a mystery 
As long as my name O.C. live on through infinity 
My identity, will ring bells in all facilities 
From fans to enemies I'm the antidote and remedy 
I'ma philosophize, analyze, no question 
If I die I'ma return like Jesus' resurrection 
I'm a blessin to the rap game, my claim to fame is when 
I disappear reappear, I put rappers to shame 
Plain and simple, in common English, what I distinguish 
The meanest lyric flamethrower your career's over 
Finesse a mic Casanova, Don Juan or MC 
The people need a change, this rap shit is deranged

Material items and shit
Beware motherfuckers
Word up, don't let it getcha, you know?
This shit ain't nothing

Yo, you live the life of a hustle 
Not sympathetic to a user
Making cats fast taking trips to Bermuda
Elegant women, all lovely and feminine 
Houses with arces, and big pools for swimming in
Big transactions, swiping all the action
Driving a Benz and Lex, you be like maxing
Jewels be on truck shit
Rims with fat clusters
Diamonds on your teeth, shining shimmers and lusterous
And God's hanging sideways, holding your head high
Cruising through a block, so you past a dreads
Now the dreads are looking hard at your face Mr. Fly Guy
Unaware tonight their gonna do a fucking drive by
Go home watch a sci-fi flick, with a chick, till
10pm, now it's time for you to dip
Go round up a few men hold a classified
Info inside, hand picked these nigga's you confided in the shippment
To pick up quick, click off Clyde's
Seven numbers for you if their gonna demise 
A scheme of betrayal
Guess in your valley you was higher then self
Work, short from another fly guy
By george i think he's got it 
Chicks gooms and lump sums
Trickering 5-0 wild to be like dumb dums
One of the few never having a heart
Issue was smart some ass with it 
Came to cash don't give a shit
Attitude more money, and more money
Dog days bright, and more sunny
4 in the morning drinking Seneca apple juice in the rent a car
Neighborhood star, got riddled and scarred

Equipment ropped off, you can hear the vagas echo for miles and breath
Bass pounds the asphalt
Thunder vibration shake like a tremble from a earthquake and
O.C. a classic in the making, mental make thoughts
My physical form words
Hot in my mouth like a joust, no doubt
Some a phenomenon, mic technician, electrician
Spit the mic down the middle like an el producto
And throughout the resin, then asapoltin this shit
Gift to gather a rhyme, make rap a staired son
The way I do this, switch up the fluid
So smooth you want to persuie it
I'm raw like underground sewage you
This shit for insight? Well I'm back, never was gone
What I right, be tighter than pin stripes
Born by mob boss, my flause in affect on the mic
Keep it tight, with out a fight is raw, it's only right

I know it's hot, we hot too
You ready to throw down, we ready to have a party
So if ya ready to have a party, make some noise!

Any mic I hold it in the grip of my palm
I wave it over the crowd
Dictatin shit like Genghis Khan
Nonchalantly deliver the flow like drug traffic schoolin
Bringin samatics to this rap shit
Bonafied, mic set you can't see me on it
Master the art, so now I just flaunt it
Born to live, a life and die until then
Imma keep on writin the slick rhymes with the pen
Take the cherry from a tree, like a virgin havin innocence
Bust my nuts, bringin rhymes to live like Genesis
But ritical renaissance
In death there's a flautless
Tearin shit up when it comes to me pickin up a cordless
One of New York's finest, on this trip I co-incide with be	 Minus

To get flass or pencil hurt, battin me down

Blow up like a shuttle, when I give you my rebuttle
Frame of mind, across state lines
Await the taste, me like fine wines from Avidian

Sometimes it slip away and I lose devotion
My judgement get cloudy
Then I want to get rowdy
Like Arabia
Terrorize like Saudi Arabia
My avons reflects my mood swing
Switch colors like a mood ring
Wifey telling me good things
So I won't strain
Got grey hairs, and only been here 25 years
Shed tears for niggaz I knew for life, now lifeless
When you died to us, was like the Iranian crisis
I took it hard like a flick slow mo' breathing
Prophetize dot of a book______summer night's dreaming
Semi-wet as I write this
Dragging the cancer sticks
Smoke thick, Hennessey shots to my wig
Half naked while I jot this
Lounging in my boxers
Dreaming Tahiti, even settle for the Bahamas
I get a boner
When am asleep dreaming that I'm louging on a yaucht

Feels like I woked up to a cloud filled room with angel dust
It's just the...

Make me want to cuss
I lust, for living a life a righteousness
With invisible forces stand in my way, keeping my mind off course

I'm searching for the light like Noah
The flame combust
Upon the bush forseeing my future like the Nova
Pushing for the brighter side of living a life
A better time pouring rhymes like wine
Till my cup run it over
Temptation on my shoulder
I'm growing colder then a polar bear
Thinking about a bank hold up
I fall upon my lap, and rest my head upon my knee caps
Is it a crime that I be dreaming about the G's black?
Freeze for a minute, gotta take control of my life
Gotta hold it like a knife
Must have more then a slice you know
Frustration, mental masturbation, (confusion)
Life is love living till I'm right be in a illusion
Seclusion, seeing me is rare
I rather attain stacks mack the islands on a plane ready for lift off
And spend grands, sipping exotic juice
Laying in the shade and shores
At a fly resort, on my cell contact the D.I.T.C. cohorts
Talking to the God Finesse
We tight like indians with a mohawk
And so on,
Conversation going on do the math
Dreaming I leave the___ Champagne bubble bath
Reality I wake up to
Feels like I woked up to a cloud filled room with angel dust

With invisible forces stand in my way, keeping my mind off course

But time seem to go slow
Busting your ass to go from a amateur to a pro
Low budget feeling inside no more can you score
Bad and good fight inside just like a war
(Slavery later foundation for my nation centuries before 
 Final Call be the New World Order) 
2 K's on it's way, no time for play
So I prey to God got me on a path of righteuos ways
Even though i get stressed, and frustrated
The best time for me to bless a rhyme is to put the pen through a test
(Yeah I want the riches
 The misses on my side on a pool, with the night
 When blitzed, and magic like a grand wizard)
Official O.C. a two syllable sound
Three six incomplete like the earth was round
And on that note keep hope alive
Striving to rise
From the inner soul
Seeing through the eyes of a crow you know
Slow pacing walk forth is only right
separating the cause
From another man ""Far From Yours""
(Going for mine still coming off a two year hiatus)
And in that time nigga's bit my shit like alligators
It's alright though this rap shit is stress for us
It makes you feel like your in a hallway robust with angel dust
Reality i wake up to
My old dad once told me how you live your life is all on you son

Oscar award winning your shit I'm bored with it
Stop copy-catting son (why?) cause your dog did it
Get your own lingo, make up your own jingle
Ten years later you be bitin my single
Primo, take it Downtown, Swing it
Intervenin on the board, sensimil steamin, yeah
Catch the vibe like a tribal dance
In the clubs on the low with the be	-boy stance
Money rubbin with a shorty got bumped by a chump
Tell him, 'Step off, I'm doin the Hump'
Yeah

I say it's my world, and I won't stop
and if you stand in my way you bound to get dropped

Some wish that I was gone cause they know I'ma win
In a minute I 'll be makin six G's times ten
I'm the computer, printin out data take notes
then analyze the information and press send
Freaky like porno, Ron Jeremy saw no
obstacle or pussy to stop him from bonin a hoe
Me and the mic double trouble
Chicks look at us like twins, all lovable and huggable
Prognosis, on the, mic I choke out
Had the same effects from coughin blowin smoke out
Architect, rap technician, man listen
It's no doubt you gonna pump this in your system
My skills ill, and all of that above
Confidence, I'm not worried bout a street buzz
I'm O.C., who you?  I never heard of ya
Get out my face 'fore I turn into a motherfuckin murderer
I want the green like indo, a mansion, a car
A wife who's never been a bimbo
Too much to ask well to me that's simple
want to retire on a yacht called the S. S. Minnow

I say it's my world, and I won't stop
And if you stand in my way, you bound to get dropped
(repeat 4X)

Top choice, this here nigga got poise
Ain't a man alive who could stop my noise
I snatch a star from the sky, spark up your lye
You stand astounded wonderin how I did it
Now you're star struck, like I truck gold
Treatin me like a nigga havin a million records sold
Now a starchild, phenmonen like the X-Files
Rappers know I'm comin so they go in exile
Czar in this rap shit, comin on your mattress
Microphone fiend I make beats do backflips
Fear me like genocide, serious
How I do it through your stereo, mysterious
O.C. do demolition, nil competition
Like robot Kong on a destroy mission
A matter of life and death you try to fight for breath
I snatch your heart from a slice through your chest
Who the best, from New York to Bogota
Who got face thinkin they scare me with a scar, shit
What I be bringin is a terrible sight
A performance never again performed on the mic

I say it's my world, and I won't stop
And if you stand in my way, you bound to get dropped
(repeat 4X)

Say it's my world...
It's my world...",My World
O.C.,"Hey love...
Yeah...

Shopping in the city one day
On my way, met a redbone by the name of Stronjay
Five foot six, body thick, hair silky
She could make the hardest man melt and turn milky
Bugged out shit, one eye was hazel, one was blue
Lips fully packed as my attention stayed glued
Upon her outline, I cased it with my mind
Saying to myself, 'this sugar be a dime'
Yo sugar, let's have a drink, and um, talk some more
Proceed to grab my bag, and then we exit the store
Walking down the street, men is staring with amazement
Treatment something like black ???????????????
Anyhow, the star and me hit a sushi bar
Told her that I never had sushi before
Ordered saki that I already endeavored in Japan
Reached 'cross the table then I grabbed her hand
Why your man let you walk around solo like this?
My chinky eyes looked upon her as I gave her hand a kiss
This most mesmerizing young thing I must say
Echoes in my thoughts since I met you that day

Chorus:
Stronjay, a beautiful thing I must say
Her body got curves like waves in The Bay
Lips light smooth, just like Alize
The bizomb, I couldn't see her blowing my way

Stronjay responds, men only want her 'cause she rich
Her beeper start buzzin' so we pullin' out a flip
In the back of my mind, I'm sayin' 'yes, go ???????'
Find a nigga rich in New York's one in a million
She wanted to leave, I said 'Is this the end?'
Then she gave me an invitation back to her crib
I never surprise, I flag a cab, she says 'un uh'
My car's round the block in the parking garage
Got the vehicle, ???? the speed like Batman out of his cave
500 Benz whippin' in the wind
Destination 57 Park Ave. south
Turn my face a little, wipe the slob from my mouth
The building was immaculate inside with marble floors
We hit the elevator, she slips out of her draws
I'm shocked like goodies and I don't know how to take 'em
Titties in my face and like a gun I must face 'em
This most mesmerizing young thing I must say
Echoes in my thoughts since I met you that day

CHORUS

Top floor, penthouse suite for sure
It was classy like some type of fly furniture store
She grabbed me up and intertwined into a kiss with me
I tried taking off my clothes, she assisted me
Upon her fireplace wall is were I pushed her back
Then on the plush floor we fell; passionate collapse
She pushed me off, but the push wasn't mean
To the fridge, and came back with strawberries and whipped cream
The scene is set, but baby not just yet
'cause strawberries and whipped cream ain't complete without Moet
Foreplay; nibblin' my tongues in the air
Layin flat on her back, I love tappin' on the rear
Nuff time we spent gettin' excited, I'm delighted
Excstasy, I know honey-hun she won't fight it
She stands up, and lead me by my hand, we fled
Into a room with a king size canopy bed
This most mesmerizing young thing I must say
Satisfied O in like each and every way

CHORUS

Me and Premo, you know, East New York
Bushwick, Bedstuy, and all those good places

Yo
My main frame, discipline like a soldier
Ready for war, pushups get my chest swoll up
What's the deal Preme? I mean the scaze
I think I got it locked in nigga, War Games is the theme
Rap commando, what's my handle
O.C. ample to rock shit
Battle niggas who pop shit
Green bareen thought slicka
I'm one step ahead, slide thru enemy lines like a black ack figga
Camouflage, runnin thru you zone with detection
Cuz the dark skinned marksmen
Run thru your section
Flesh ya bones, physical built like titanium
Bugs cover my grill like Iranians
Ill gorilla so called killas
I fear no man but Allah, for the god is he is still in us
The Renaissance Man, I roll with real like grenade
sharp like gem stars
Cause massive scars
O.C.'s all in it, dope I've been for years
Now I'm back in the scene, and I declare War Games

I bust off like a M-16
Rippin thru screens from head to toe, blood soak up your jeans
Rap veteran, earn my stripes, faught wars
Opposing forces, would O.C. take losses?
Naucious, you feelin kinda like throwing up
Cautious, watch ya step, land rhymes blowin up
Havin a pity for foes, fuck G.I. Joe
He's a sucker, slap the taste outta wild motherfuckas
Design a rhyme, like a plan for the government
Six Million like Steve Austin, costin
Apprehended if I am
In times and my body will erupt *explosion*
M-16 tapecatin, voids filled with ammo
Bust it through a crowd, a bitch nigga sing soprano
When I get you in the square, then I end you career
All MC's lets make one thing clear
You're all the same, I will remain, fuck the fame
Feelin the lane to shoot, I declare War Games

[Chorus: x2]
I declare War Games
For niggas who flaunt figgas for more fame
Gorilla warfare, tactics issue unlimited access to ammo
With fire proof camouflage and power

Precise pinpoint it, pull it, when I cock back
This here rap will slap you and your team, and that bad bitch
Sleaves from my uncut, raw like cope
Preme dig up boys, roll up and smoke
Then toge it, back to B.I.
See I can do this, I'm professional
Too much weight to weigh any style
Dutch Master superior blend, inhale me right
Young Phillies take a toke of my rap, and get the
Willies para-
Noid, niggas all non void
Fuck with O.C., get your life destroyed
Like a marine, I'm a trained rap killing machine
Fiend to rock a mic, set from New York to New Orleans
Over seas I conquer, rough like blanca
Love to eat actors, gotta take for drama
When I flow I get comatose
In my own world
From the first verse, you saw my plan unfurl
I mean team same name, never change
My ammo is the demo competition on the mic

Who got the hardest, MC style, ever created? 
Who got celebrity, status, and is still underrated? 
Who got them two glock nines that be black and nickel plated? 
And I'll blow a nigga's chest out, to keep me motivated 
My periphreal, sees MC's, that ain't nice with these 
So all my new rivalries'll be, MC robberies 
I got these niggaz shook like, Shake-N-Bake, cook like 
I knock your punk ass out, wake you up, and I show you 
What I look like, who's that MC, that thinks that he can fuck with 
F-are-E-D-D-I-E, excuse me, Bumpy Knucks 
I don't give a fuck, if it's friend or foe 
This shit is my job to let you niggaz know so don't take it personal 
When I stick this verse in you, I don't know what you gon' do 
Even if you get your crew I'll walk through the stage 
Like it's Hoe Stroll Avenue, tappin on them pockets 
Puttin tabs on your revenue, now dig this 
It's mad niggaz that be thinkin they nice with they flow 
It's mad niggaz that be frontin like they holdin some dough 
It's mad niggaz that'll challenge me and after the show 
They Don't want to Be Players no mo', like Joe 
Niggaz try and come at me, with contemporary gangsta 
Fusion I'm smashin with the simple shit I'm usin 
Bashin and bruisin, who's in charge, BUMPY 
Step up in my face I leave your forehead LUMPY 

[Chorus] 

I bring the pain like a slice to your vein, fuck your fame 
Platinum and gold plate, don't hold no weight 
I be that, prophetic soul drainer, ain't a motherfucker 
In his right mind steppin in my cipher tryin to take mine 
From West coast to East I'm full-fledged 
Bust the science, niggaz better know the ledge 
O see all, I G off, enemy I spot you 
Two rhymes to my one verse, you go first 
You tasteless face it, I engrave my name in your scalp 
Like Damien, out for world domination 
Don't get me wrong, I don't represent 666 figures 
I'm just out to make figures 
Who holds the threshold, to be the best 
I crunch niggaz with my gold teeth like, vegetables 
Carnivorous deliverance, murder one nemesis 
Like a virgin, I snatch your innocence 
Talkin bank robberies when you rhyme, hold up 
You turn pussy on the mic when I roll up 
Coca-Cola, a fission like soda 
While you say butter, I'ma say Mazola 
Money folder hold a grudge cold like a polar bear 
Thug niggaz what? Blowin up spots like a SCUD 

Win the G, win the G 
Win the G, RRRRAHHHH! 

Who's that New York nigga left, that be nice like B.I. 
G.I., niggaz can't see I, see why? 
You new poppin niggaz, and you crew hoppin niggaz 
Step up in my face, and Bumpy be, 2Pa-cin niggaz 
If this bitch up in yo' heart, I'ma find it 
If you think I'm talkin to you, then just rewind it 
I got six shots behind this, even with a vest on 
Ya yellin, because I aim for the melon 
I'm a felon, and I bet you never, been in a fight 
Kinda like you really, never said shit on this mic 
So if I diss a nigga hustlin that makes me a displayer 
And if you buy my record twice, that makes you a two-payer/toupee-er 
And if your girl like Donna Karan, that makes her a DK-er 
And cause I hate your punk ass, that don't make you no playa 
Without this record business shit you niggaz is broke as fuck 
Smokin weed smokin woolies while I smoke your luck 
And while your flow needs, medical aid 
I just appear on niggaz shit, and I still get paid 
Now where's my G nigga? 

What niggaz'll think they made of steel and want to play brave? 
Bitch MC's will find theyself in the grave 
I make slaves of niggaz in ways never made 
Voice like an Ox or better yet sharp as a blade 
Intense the moment like sex when I'm bonin 
Iller than Caligula brainwashed the Romans 
I set it, let it be known, better beware, better be careful 
Who dared to oppose my phenomenal flows, how dare you? 
I smite your ass quick fast like Flash runnin past your ass 
Niggaz'll end up with whiplash 
But for the moment, I'm zonin, any opponents 
I'ma cut it short right now, because this rap shit we own it

Givin' NYC, nigga I live in it
Let's go, mess no, rhyme I bless the flow
Dippin' with UNI, swerve, control the Lex though
Boppin' with Jigga, droppin' jewels to beats
Then I bounce and ghost ride with my main man Sweets
He can wax a nigga

As sure as my name is OC, I hold much testosterone
And serve like hors d'ouevers
I'm maximum, human saxophone
You respect what I'm saying like Al Capone
You crumb bubble gum rappers I chew
Blow you up, spit you out like food without seasonin', you got no taste
Yo OG, who could solo with me?
These kids be half grown
I'm an adult, seen it all
I'm forced to show VI's can duck proper
My ways and actions, far from an imposter
Shine like bright light
Your worst nightmare like Fright Night
Comin' to you live like a fight night
Must you steal the way I drop bars on this?
Perfection at it's best, I'm marvelous
Applaud me you better, I ???? to get a response
Control shit at the snap of a finger like I'm the Fonz
Fella whattup?

You say it ain't so, how I freak the flow

Big G, Dog Tag Crew holdin' it down
Cousin Boo will make a you and bust shots at you
You see, it's my world, or like so it seems
Chillin' with Prim, dippin' on the highway in a Beem
And it's a wonderful day, just coolin' one night
Celebratin' a par-tay with a nigga named ""Life""
We twisted, kid you missed it
At a down low spot, Champagne poppin' off like a biscuit
Nuff love, word life, I'm high tonight
No brawls or fights, just men, no mice
Indecisive about things in life alone
So sometimes I speak in a hyper tone
See I won't neglect this, nor can you deny
Renassaince man, make it live, the fly guy
Respect me like a Kennedy, acknowledge my identity
O's like a cure, I'm the source, the remedy
You know it

And guess who's controllin the bank - Mush
Numero uno in the raps that I spank - Mush

Or nasty like a kid with a mouth that's loose
The purest form of anything considered to be raw
Like porno chicks takin' cum shots and sayin' (more)
I'm wicked in ways you can't describe my persona
Good times, treat it like the hips on Wilona
From New York to Arizona, from Las Vegas, Nevada
to San Fran' to them third world borders, I
won't stop, won't hush
I'm like some good ass smoke that you just can't crush
No matter what, M-U-S-H, S-H-I-N-E I was designed to be
I'm what you call content, and even with a hundred mill' in the bank
If you owe me I want every red cent

Yo, I'm in the Rover with my co-defendant, the club ended
Wolves posted out in front of the spot, I'm feelin vengeance in the air
Some kids had beef with last year
Hit my man 'cross the face with a bat now it's our tears
We caught one cat a month, Pryor lit fire to 'em
I kicked him in his dick, now his fuck game ruined
His ex-girl I'm screwin, disrespect all around the board
Homeboy, motherfuck you and yours

Doin dirt comes back ten times over
Watchin your back becomes a 9 to 5 to survive
Gettin drunk is a mistake, you gotta stay sober
Cause the, blink of an eye is all it takes to die

[O.C.]
Parked the Rover post outside the trunk, no idea
these the same kids from last year
I'm indecisive 'bout the baseball cats pulled low; for some reason
stomach had butterflies to leave but I didn't go
My dog said let's go chill by the exit
And watch the hoes come out, nah dawg, I'ma chill right here
Tryin to get a good look at these dudes
Yet the crowd was less than what I saw before, I play it cool
Get the keys from my co-D, hit the alarm
Played the driver's seat, turn on some tunes to stay calm
Lean my, skull on the headrest, heart pumpin inside of my chest
I'm wide open, no gun, no vest
Shoulda listened to the voice in my head, and told my man let's dip
A big commotion, somebody started some shit
Mouth dry from fear, unaware of homeboy and his peeps
was right behind me, creepin up from the rear

Niggaz approach from the blindside, tapped on the window
I was, smokin the indo, paranoid like a schizo
My eyes opened wide surprised, like I saw a ghost
Lookin down the barrel of toast, I sit froze
It was the kid we stomped out, with a devilish grin
From a year ago, back with his men, back for revenge
White flash, it smashed the window, hittin my chest in tempo
Ears ringin like a clash from a cymbal
Fightin to breathe, thinkin 'bout my girl and my seed
Slumped over like a parapleg', not promised to see
sunrise or my, son rise to manhood
Will he feel abandoned?  FUCK
I tried fightin, people lookin in the car frightened
like I ain't gon' make it... damn...

Connects with Sosa, the nigga that killed Tony
Now I throw pies like pizza chefs
We eat your bread, y'all niggaz get beat to death
You wanna see somethin? Playa watch, we sprayin shots
when haters plot, some been slingin rocks since Mayor Koch
I heard a lot about you
But I don't give a fuck, so I gotta shout you
Party Arty in the truck, but you can't see him
Had to warn 'em, better join 'em if you can't beat 'em
And I'd give anything for my man freedom
Trick and Tone comin home to the fam-bino
And I'm that nigga like my man Nino
So let your crew, your clique, and family know

Get off me, started talkin fast and lost me
Of course we them niggaz, ""What What"" like N.O.R.E.
I blind hoes, when I step in the club
My chain so bright, I got chicks checkin for bugs
D-Flow lyrically I'm swift with the tongue fo' sho'
Killer you feelin me I'm sick with the gun and yo
It's nuttin new son, bring your crew son
I knew none of these rappers, had it, my flow like magic
Hoes attracted to the kid with the small bling
South Boogie, niggaz got it plus more bling
On the spot a hot 16 that ain't shit
Rock blue and grey all day, and I ain't Crip
My bank sick, dough stack to the sky
And I'ma stay high with a pound in the back of the 5

We get it poppin, we get it crackin, we get it dusty
We get it crunk son, we get it all that, trust me

What's my profile?
Demeanor of a chief over this here beat, check the pow-wow
Sirens, reminiscent to violence
Wildlife, with about a hundred niggaz behind us
Get it feelin like it's World War 3 up in this bitch
before the bomb hits nigga
We get it dirty, done deal, guns I reveal
Yo' gun stay concealed, let's leave it at that
Machine gun rap spray off
Layin niggaz six feet, eyes wide from the chaos
Many minds wanna know why they call me Mush
But if I tell ya then I got ta kill ya
See I leave no stones underturned, that's how a lot of niggaz get burned
Man I'm ""Deep Cover"" like Fishburne
It's my turn, pay-offs is froo froo
Layoffs'll make a nigga turn postal and shoot you

Be full of ambition, never givin up on them good things
I love my life, it's worth livin
When I feel I'm at a standstill and things ain't right
I look to my niggaz for insight
and vice verse adjust my thoughts, play it like sports
Grown-ass man and I'm my own brand
It's safe to say I'm too fly to waste away
Responsibilities, give me a price to pay
Not livin for today cause half ain't okay
I'm far from greedy, but I want the whole entree
Give me silk, take away the satin
Prefer somethin beyond gold, I want platinum
I'd rather chill in the Bermudas than in Palm Springs under palm trees
With my lady sippin on the Malibu Bay Breeze

[Chorus: O.C.]

Born to drop gems more exotic than Tahiti

From state to state, cross borders, even clear across waters
What I fuse, how I choose, the way I use
what I rock can't be excused
Fur thoughts like a chinchilla

I, Black Moses, Brooklyn God, Jehovah
And the Mayor, some be thugs and some players
Crown a new king G, bring me wine and grapes
on a plate, rubber bands on them things
separate the gold and the ice, playin it safe
It bring smiles to the gold teefs in my face
Yeah, uhh, everyday I say my grace
Uh-huh..

Yo, I'm deep rooted, watch my ass for intruders
Hate to pack guns but if provoked I shoot it
Request the best, I'll blaze 'em all
Kings with crowns, I see many ways for y'all to fall
It's my world y'all, and I set the pace
Come in my zone, niggaz better 'bout face
Judgin from the fact I been in the game for some time
All I did was age like wine
Redefine what I'm after, did what I had to do
to break through, and reserve another chapter
For all those years, I played the rear
Now it's time to step up a notch and boost the rep up
I'm pure skill, like fishscale
Get you wide open this here's XL
I shall prevail in the game, feelin the flame grow stronger
Can't hold it back any longer
Right the wrong, whether storms ahead
Wildlife's in your area, we killin 'em dead
No reason for treason, money don't matter to the clique
When it comes to us, we break it even

Blood pulsatin, adrenaline flowin
Full moon at night, on the stoop gettin right
I'll never forget the day before
Son told me to tuck my ice in cause niggaz was triflin
We did what he said but the habit in me
was to show it off, I still let my chain swang free
Not really thinkin 'bout a set up, or even gettin wet up
that summer night from such advice
So I proceed to parlay, like I do in BK
But this wasn't home, and niggaz shoulda known
to stay on point, niggaz shoulda been on point
And the price paid was lookin down the barrel of a joint
We was dead meat, and them niggaz was wolves
But they didn't want our flesh, dem niggaz wanted the jewels
It happened so quick, no time to get afraid
First instinct was to run like a slave
Me and Schoolly Boy was boxed in
My man Hugh's a few feet away, with a pound at his face
I looked, son in his eyes cause I know how he is
While the other faggot nigga had the gun in my ribs
I thought - fuck, shit 'bout to get buckwild
Popped off my chain, threw it with a Coke and a smile
Thinkin leave already, but them niggaz wasn't done
They went in our pockets for change, numbers and bubblegum
Now - how low can a lowlife get, askin what size are my kicks?
Like I'ma say 8 and shit
To myself I was sayin I'ma MURDER this kid
But thank the Lord they didn't peel back my wig
The jux wasn't longer than a minute to Mush
Then them niggaz tried to tell us, do the Carl Lewis
No backshots buddy, I began to walk backwards
And bust my ass, it all happened so fast
He thought I was shot, starin at me in shock
Turned around, them niggaz was gone, vanished up the block

Massive respect we get, nuttin less
We hold power in the place when they see our face
We try to stay low pro' but it's I'm-possible

Only crack I'd rather is a ass wearin a thong from

to Rio, De Janeiro, to Spain and then some
Slummin degrees with chicks that I met from Belize
Sanjy, Angie, Rhonda, Big Tez, Charise
I'm not lyin y'all, it's the life I know
And if I lie my nose will grow
I'm not biased to the fact I went plat' over gold
Cause when in Rome that's a whole 'nother song
Gettin head on the Leanin Tower of Pisa from an Italian diva

I gotta have it it's a habit I don't even pass it
Do you mean I'm a addict? No I just smoke a lot

And I can tell you how strong it is if I cough or not
I puff the magic dragon, I got a ounce
In every pocket, that's why my pants is staggin'

And I should stop it but at this point is too late

Can't find, if I don't puff I'ma eat that weed

Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Lift you to your higher ground

He'll be back on his knees to express himself

Make him express how he feels and maybe

And I knew I wanted her for me

Well she looked at us both
Then she called me to her side

She said son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight thing

I went straight to the church
I just couldn't wait for that little girl of mine
When I got off from work
The preacher was there
So was my future bride

Not an overnight fling

But then I came home from work a little early one night
And there she was kissin on another man

Will I ever be the same?
Oh yeah!  When you see me smiling
You know things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see has all been rehearsed
Darling, I can't go on without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside, darling

O.C. Smith,"
She's a friend, she's a lover, she's a woman, she's a wife.
She's the answered prayer ev'ry lonely man dreams of.
She's a temptress, she's a lady, she's the mother of my baby.
I thank God I'm the lucky man she loves.
 
Sometimes I lie awake and watch her sleeping;
and I just wanna bust and the teardrops fill my eyes.
And I wonder what she'd think if she woke up and caught me weeping; 
'cause daddies and heroes ain't supposed to cry.
The morning always seems to catch us laughing
with the baby in the bed between us, safe and warm.
And I thank the Lord above for all the good times that I'm having
wrapped up in my woman's loving arms. 
She's a friend, she's a lover, she's a woman, she's a wife.
She's the answered prayer ev'ry lonely man dreams of.
She's a temptress, she's a lady, she's the mother of my baby.
I thank God I'm the lucky man she loves.
 
And when the load gets heavy on my shoulders;
and I can't keep the pace, and I need a place to hide,
I run home to my own little world and take her in my arms,
and hold her; and I soon forget there's another world outside.
'cause she's a friend, she's a lover, she's a woman, she's a wife.
She's the answered prayer ev'ry lonely man dreams of.
She's a temptress, she's a lady, she's the mother of my baby.
I thank God I'm the lucky man she loves.

With my hair down in my eyes and she says ""Hi""
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are goin' off to schoolâ?¦goodbye
And she reaches out 'n' takes my hand
And squeezes it 'n' says ""How ya feelin', hon?""

And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when my self is feelin' low
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind

Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy
And ask her if she could get away and meet me
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me
'cause she's made that way

And if that ain't lovin' me

O.C. Smith,"The Son Of Hickory Holler's Tramp
O see Smith
From the vinyl album ""O see Smith's Greatest Hits""
Oh, the path was deep and wide
From footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock
And there would stand a stranger

Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp
Yeah, the weeds were high, the corn was dry
When daddy took to drinking
Him and Sally Walker, they up and ran away
Then Momma shed a silent tear

And promised fourteen children
""I swear you'll never see a hungry day""
When Momma sacrificed her pride
The neighbours started talking
But we were much too young
To understand the things they said
All we really cared about
Was Momma's chicken dumplings
And a goodnight kiss
Before we went to bed

Oh, you know, the path was deep and wide
From footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock
And there would stand a stranger
Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp
When Daddy left and destitution

Came upon our family
Not one neighbour volunteered
To lend a helping hand
So just let 'em gossip all they want
She loved us, and she raised us
The proof is standing here
A full grown man

Last summer Momma passed away
And left the ones who loved her
Each and every one is
More than grateful for their birth
And each Sunday she receives
A big bouquet of fourteen roses
With a card that reads

We wasn't thinkin' about parole we had x-dates 
I put the P into paper to free my mind 
Once a nigga get released I gotta get mine 
I never knew I had to struggle in this industry 
But stop rockin' the mic they said it couldn't be 
So in the meantime the inbetween time 
I kept writting in the hall where it's cold 
Cause I couldn't sto fight 
Five years later I hit the streets 
I found my niggas we got it together flowin' on T.V. 
We had to come up with some money cause the shit costs 
(Who broke it off?) My nigga G.T. and the motherfuckin' boss 
We made song after song for the bitches and the homies 
While why'all was at home lookin' at videos of the phonies 
Now the Bottom is comin' back with a killing flow

But she acts like I'm tellin a lie 
While you fallin in love with a she...

Could you see me in a car that rhymes with rent me and starts with a be 
Could you see a Bentley

And my fist on top of the wood

Followed the wheel and I got aroused 
Swung in the ditch and I wrecked the frame 
Broke up with my foreign car and fell in love with my cadillac

I act a rat, 'cause I'm from the gutter 
Ya girl stutter when I pull up next to ya 
You been with the girl 6 months Paul Wall 
Is the reason she won't give sex to ya 
Why all that plex in ya

My big body's pregant with twins I'm bout to induce a baby benz 
Ya car was fly in the hood but my candy paint just wet ya flames 
I'm sittin on 22 inch baby sitters babelous threatin ya name 
Forgot to change the diaper so when I crept in the lane I left a stain 
Everytime it rains, paint drips It makes a mess and I get the blame 
My TV's are the pet I train I can make em roll over and play dead 
My car was blue on the freeway 
But when I stopped at the light it changed to red 
You betta re arrange ya head thinkin I trick my cash to a broad... 
Go ahead and ask ya broad I got more green than the grass in a yard 
And that's so raw It ain't hard for me to get the class to applaud

Nowhere to lay, nowhere to pray
Just imagine, if you wore the same clothes thirty days
With scuffed up dirty J's, and plenty holes in your shirt
And won't nobody help you, they treat you like dirt

I'm the type of cat, that start shit for no reason
Use to have meetings, with the church deacon
Cause I was doing other shit, while he was preaching
And every single thing, he was saying came true
And when we got our shit together, in 9-2
And boy I was a fool, at making that cash
Hit licks flipping bricks, right after every class

O.G. Ron C.,"[Chorus] 
Oh no, there go them Texas boys banging in a fo' do' 
Top fell out the drop, crawling on 84's 
Think of taking my slab, baby I don't think so 
My heat under my seat, and I don't love you hoes 
Living it like a G, but still I gotta lay low 
Five percent or ten, but still my screens goin' glow 
These haters be in my mix, and these boppers be on my dick 
Every time I come round the corner 

I'm from the land of opportunity, in God we trust 
But haters in my mix, got me paranoid and disgust 
I'm scoping out my side mirrors, when my car's in park 
It's after dark, and my slab is fresh meat to these sharks 
Boys thinking I been drinking, so I'm off my note 
But I got seventeen surprises, tucked inside of my coat 
See me strut through the parking lot, on 22's plus 
It's a must I make all haters, eat my dust 
Them jump-out boys, waiting trying to catch me slipping 
I ain't tripping, grain ain't the only thing that I'm gripping 
Boys jacking with these tow trucks, thinking they slick 
But take a trip to South Lee, and end up in a ditch 
They got my purple people eater once, the next day 
I bought a Range Rover cash, and a new set of fronts 
I've been on feet for months, I'm taking haters to lunch 
Paul Wall and Trae, hit em with that one-two punch 

[Chorus] 

When I flip in my slab 
I'm fin to beat they back off, like I was legs 
Sitting low and tinted on chrome, gangstafied till I'm finished 
I'm bout to diminish these haters, when my trunk start waving 
Blue over gray, side of my drop with six T.V.'s I'm displaying 
They hate that I'm shining, with the fifth wheel falling flying down the block 
But if one of these haters, wanna jack me 
Slugs goin' be flying, out the glock 
I click for no reason, this season my slab is staining they brain 
And I be known for getting reckless in Texas, gripping on grain 
Forever be pimping, 84 tipping all through the South 
Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth 
They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em 
Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking 
But not today, cause Trae goin' be flipping on top of his game 
We guerillas I'm mobbing with, ain't no stopping me man 
When I'm in my fo' do' solo, the slab is bound to get tossed 
And if you trying to be competition, then you bound to be getting lost 

[Chorus] 
 
Make way for the team, when the fo' do' be coming round the corner 
These haters are goners, cause I'ma drop the top when I wanna 
I know these jackers, better think before they reach out and touch 
Cause in back of the car is the Excursion, full of thugs that'll punch 
I know they wanted to get me, but they don't know what I'm bringing 
I pop the trunk and swing the block, while jamming Slow Loud And Bangin' 
Trae and Paul Wall on a mission, and ain't no stopping it man 
With my hand on my heat in my seat, and the other on grain 

Mo' money mo' problems man, the legend is true 
You better stay up on your toes, when you ride 22's 
I'm rolling strapped, everywhere I go I'm watching my back 
Cause on my block, them jackers don't give a damn if I rap 
People see me being friendly, and they think that I'm soft 
But the truth is, my best friend is a sawed off 
These haters in my mix, got me losing composure 
But if they take one step closer, it ain't gon be kosher naw

O.G. Ron C.,"Every since the day you went away and left me lonely and cold 
My life just hasn't been the same, oh baby no 
When I looked into your eyes the moment that I let you go I just broke down 
Baby if I ever get the chance to be with you again I would sacrifice 
'Cause the feeling that I feel within 
No another man would never make me feel so right 
Its nice to smile when I get your phone call at night, 
But I rather have you here with me, 
Right next to me and that's the way you hold me tight, 

I got to let you know I feel so weak without your touch 
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much 
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny 
For you id cross the world for you id do anything 
That's right baby I'm going crazy 
I need to be your lady 
I've been thinking latley 
That you and me, yes we can make it 
Just ride with me, roll with me I'm in love with you baby 
That's right baby I'm going crazy 
I need to be your lady 
I've been thinking latley 
That you and me, yes we can make it 
Just ride with me, roll with me I'm in love with you baby 

Brake it down now tell you what I feel, 
From the moment I met you its been so damn real, 
My heart seems to skip another beat every time we speak, 
Can't believe I feel so weak 
Tell me that you really need me, 
You want me, you miss me, you love me, 
I'm your lady, 
Ill be around waiting for you, 
Put it down be the women for you 
I'm falling so deep for you 
Cause your you 
I'm callin, callin out to you, 
What am I gonna do 
Its true no frontin 
Its you, and no other, 
I can know long ago I'm with out you ill just break down 

I got to let you know I feel so weak without your touch 
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much 
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny 
For you id cross the world for you id do anything

Waiting on you fools to start tripping, run up then
What's up girl, I ain't tripping on your man
I do it Dago style, Low Pro always in command

I let em know you can't clown me
See I'm the Royal, I'm known, and fine hynas want to hound me

Don't ask me why, little girl.

You are my nights; my night and day.

But in my eyes you'll always be.

Since they wouldn't let me drink
When I get a post release
I'mma buy so many bottles they gon' think I'm Big Meech
When I caught that bird bitch I'mma put it to her beak
No I'mma put it to her brows, now they really on fleek
See I grew up in the 'jects
Had to fight for my respect
Elevator wasn't workin' so we took the pissy steps
I went years without no sex
So you know that pussy wet
And you ain't a real hustler if you can't bust a check, bitch

No body can ever hear him call

She's into Alka Seltzer
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train

Know you're wrong you say you're right
I hate the books you read and all your friends

Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say 

Chained to all the places that he never wished to stay

Come on girls
You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Y en una mirada se pintaron sueños
Le salieron alas y tocaron el cielo

Y ella imagino que el dinero no importaba
Porque amor no les faltaba

Soñaron, soñaron que eran dos enamorados
Sin futuro sin pasado, soñaron, soñaron
Que los dos eran iguales
Con las mismas realidades, el amor, el amor

Ella le pagó lo que le debía
Y así despertaron de su fantasía
Y se despidieron con una sonrisa
Como confirmando lo que se sabía

Y el imagino que eran ricos y se amaban

Que la cárcel te despoja de ilusion why humanidad
Pero si un amor es fuerte nada lo derrumbara
Why va creando un camino para de nuevo empezar

De repente llega Paco con su guille del Mesías
Quiere abrir la vieja iglesia y me ofreció ser diácono
Quiere hacer de cuatro tablas un pequeño vaticano
En bersen de new que profecía

Empeñado en el proceso y sus preparativos
Fue regando la noticia al que encontraba en su camino
Mientras que en la casa las dos hijas bien contentas
Porque piensan que ahora tienen quien por ellas rinda cuentas

Un hombre en la búsqueda total
De una vida nueva y diferente
Pero le quedan cosas por cambiar
Pero él dice que no es nada urgente

Ay, Paco, Paco predícame, yo nunca había oído nada igual
Como el gran Jordán tú verás acumulando puntos llegarás
Ay, Paco, Paco predícame, yo nunca había oído nada igual
Suenan las campanas y quizás un gran ministro tú serás

Un domingo en la mañana mientras Paco predicaba
De las cosas que en la iglesia se supone no se hablaran
Quiso hacer mención de la palabra abiertamente
Y al instante se esfumó el gozo que habitaba entre la gente

Un hombre en la búsqueda total
De una vida nueva y diferente
Pero le quedan cosas por cambiar

Ay, Paco, Paco predícame, yo nunca había oído nada igual

Ay, Paco, Paco predícame, yo nunca había oído nada igual
Suenan las campanas y quizás un gran ministro tú serás

Poco a poco fueron quedando sin el Mesías
Y es obvio que el mensaje escuchar nadie quería
Y una voz en el silencio a Paco le decía
Es que muchas veces la verdad es como un baño de agua fría

Decidido a cultivar las flores de su pueblo
En un monte de ladrillos frialdad y tiroteo
Dejó atrás el pulpito y las cuatro paredes
Regresó a la esquina Paco a cumplir con sus santos deberes

Ay, Paco, Paco predícame, yo nunca había oído nada igual

Obie Bermúdez,"Si corres mucho te resbalas dijo el viejo
Pero mi inmadurez fue atropellando los consejos
Ya no me quedan mas narices de repuesto
Juntar tu vida con la mia fue un acierto

Tan sublime tu perdon
A pesar de lo que soy
Mi sincera bendicion
Mereces altares, coronas why mas

A toda hora, amor a tiempo
Solo de ti es de lo que yo no me arrepiento
A toda hora, amar a tiempo
Solo why sin ti entierro el alma why ando muerto

Hay tantas cosas de las que yo hoy me confieso
Pero quedaron ya grabadas en el tiempo
Porque fajarme en discusiones con amigos
Mujer ajena en lo escondido es tan incierto

Asegura maldicion
Despedaza el corazon
Soy humano why caigo aveces
Volteando la esquina he pagado con creces

A toda hora, amor a tiempo
Solo de ti es de lo que yo no me arrepiento
A toda hora , amar a tiempo
Solo why sin ti entierro el alma why ando muerto

why porque buscarle una quinta pata al gato
Destruyendo con los pies lo que hice con las manos
Si el amor es complicado why ya lo ha desmostrado
Que los celos why las dudas queden en pasado

Seria como una condena
Que las mujeres como tu realmente

No valian la pena
Pero tu cuerpo, tu manera de mirarme
Me hizo bajar la guardia para asi dejarte entrar

Devuelveme todo aquel tiempo que perdi contigo
Ya es hora de que tu comprendas
Que estoy dispuesto a lo que sea para hacerte dano
Para que sientas lo que siento

why yo te felicito porque sabes jugar
Pero la ultima carta a ti te puede hacer llorar
Quiero doblar la apuesta para recuperar
Lo que tu te llevaste caro te puede costar

Que mala has sido, que paso,
Dime que fue lo que aqui sucedio
No digas nada, se muy bien que lo que a ti te di
No te importo

why ahora yo me enveneno con tanto rencor
Me decido a olvidar el perdon
Si la encuentro ahora mismo
Con mis propias manos le quito la vida

Como pudiste
Si yo sigo aquí en el mismo lado
Como pudiste dejarme en el suelo
Si yo sigo tan enamorado de ti

Que cambiaste por fuera tu corazon
Si fueras mas sinsera
No cargaras por dentro el mismo dolor

Y me la paso recordando los momentos
Que a tu lado fueron tiernos y perfectos
En invierno
En Marzo, Abril y Mayo por cuestiones de trabajo viajo
Y me la paso despejado y no pienso tanto en ti
Pero cuando llega el mes de Junio
Me deslizo en un abismo de tristeza y soledad
Que daría por que regresaras a mi lado

Todo el ano
Me la paso añorando tus abrazos
Se me hace tan difícil aceptarlo
Cada día, cada cambio me hace daño
Todo el ano

Y llega Julio con Agosto intentando regalarme
Un verano que te juro que es en vano porque sin tus besos
No hay calor
Septiembre y Octubre por cuestiones de colegio
Vuelvo a creer que ya te he olvidado
Hasta Noviembre
Pero cuando llega Diciembre
Me congelo en un lago de recuerdos y obscuridad
Que daría por que regresaras a mi lado

Todo el ano
Me la paso añorando tus abrazos
Se me hace tan difícil aceptarlo
Cada día, cada cambio me hace daño

Aquellos besos de tu boca
Que alguna vez me supo a gloria
Pero hoy por hoy me castiga
Que llegue a mi otro dia

Se que el tiempo sabra juzgar
Yo te quise con locura
Why desechaste mi ternura
Tu solo quisiste volar
Mientras yo hechaba raices
Tu solo querias ser libre

Busca tu camino, pero no vuelvas al mio

Que hacer para ser libre y comenzar
De que falle y merezco este calvario

Ahora solo quedan dos días
Decisiones que matean
Ojala y esto fuera mentira

El escrutinio y puerta cerrada

Get your bottles homie, pour some out (Ew yeah)

Now I understand every man got a story to tell
But fuck it, I got a story as well
Growin' up where us niggas either buried or jail
Popped by ""Dirty Harry"" or popped by the cops for they yayo, locked in a cell
Who's to blame when I was raised in this hood, where my crew was slain
Only a few remains, y'all talk about struggle
With your bubblegum lifestyles, nigga fuck you
I'm here today for fam passed away
Bodies deep six nigga, flesh decay
Real cats who had techs to spray
Babies to raise, miss them cradles went straight to the grave
The hood life is in me
So I sip the Remy, while my pockets scream ""give me""
Lend me your ear, I'm guaranteein' y'all feelin' me
Straight from the block to the industry (C'mon)

So grab your cups of beer
Put 'em up let's cheer
Here's a toast to all my soldiers who ain't here
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about
Get your bottles homie, pour some out (Ew yeah)
Now grab your cups of gin
Put 'em up let's win
Here's a toast to never lookin' back again
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about
Get your bottles homie, pour some out (Ew yeah)",Cheers

So when you find yourself in tears

As a child I was foul
Ma, I couldn't understand them things that came out your mouth (Daddy's ain't shit!)
You would fuss, cuss till your blood pressure was up
Then give up and slouch on the couch and drink ya liquor (Fuck you boy!)
A hard headed nigga I was, quick temper
Short attention span, not attending class (No)
What a dummy, I would run over you hunny
You confront me and say ""Obie you no longer have a mommy""
Don't use my phone, don't even eat my food
Matter of fact we don't speak and it was just me and you
In the house, with that mouse, and them traps and that gat
Waiting on the day for you to pull that trigger back

Don't come down, things will always work out
Don't come down, things will always work out
Don't come down, things will always work out

""Blasted bastard, you're lying, lying!""
""You tuck plastic freezer bags with dope inside of 'em!""
She knew (damn) but she hated that it was true
""I done raised 2 boys, I can do away with you""
The locks changed and the nights got colder.
I'm slangin' boulders lookin' like lookin' like a boat of toga
But fuck it I'm the O'Ster, I'm down for mines Ma

Seventeen years old on my own, using these streets as my home
There's no need to prolong this beef dear I love you
Miss Eleanor Trice, I place no one above you
You the reason when I hustle, I knew to stack
The reason when I opened up mics, I knew to rip
Your ethics you en-stored in this hectic young brotha
Rubbed off after all, now look at your boy
When they ask about me now, you don't just put your head down
Straighten up Ma, you could smile now proud
Everything's kosher with the boisterous O'Ster
Let's get closer, so regrets never approach us

Don't come down, things will always work out
Don't come down, things will always work out

My motherfuckin' momma bangin' me harder
""Nigga take your ass out their and fight them tomorrow""
That's what she told me, ""little punk, blame that on your father""
So I had no choice, nigga pick up a brick
Split a motherfucker's shit for tryin' to fuck with the kid
Get a little older, hair on my dick, now I'm curious
Niggas on the corner getting money, rockin' jewelry
Allowance, nigga that ain't man shit
Cowards, nigga that ain't man shit
I had to prove to myself
How these niggas same age as me calculating this wealth
So I got me a clique of niggas what?
Workin' one sixteenth, like ""nigga we can clean up""

Babe uh, yeah!
Girl, you my only one though aight, haha
You my baby, fuck all that shit
You're the one for me
Check it out.

[Verse - Obie Trice]
Baby I'm feeling the feelings you giving, I'm feelin your style
And I'm willing to let my guard down to figure you out
I'm picturing your figure in a swimsuit wiling
Somewhere in the Caribbean Islands
Cause the vibe you giving me now
Feels like I'm an innocent child
Sinning is never tempting when other women's around
Hands down, this is my vow
I never heard a moan sound so profound
When a nigga's digging you out, phone rings
You cuss them motherfuckers out, quit calling the house!
If I call, you're in route
There's a drought, you look out
I'm on edge, you put the palm of your hand on my head and squeeze
Please believe I ain't scared of commitment
Fuck head from them bitches!
When you could do the same, but that respect is given
Our intimacy is significantly different

[Chorus - Eminem (Obie Trice)]
You gon ride for me (you gon ride?)
Then I'm gon ride for you (I'm gon ride)
If you put your mouth on me (put it on me)
I'm a put my mouth on you
Together there ain't nothing we can't do (there's nothing)
Any problem we can see it through (we see it through)
Baby if you promise to be true (you promise?)
I will never put my hands on you
Come on and think about it

[Verse - Obie Trice]
We ain't even got to talk when we see each other
We got it all chalked out when we see each other under them covers
You my lover, I'm your friend, I'm your man, but I'm sayin
Who needs a label, we roll hand in hand
Visions of you having my little man
We joke, you call me George Foreman
Cause I'm namin him O number four, me I'm three
Plus the ol' G like the personality, she say it's meant to be
I'm in the bathroom when you pee
She in the bathroom too when a nigga doo doo, you my boo boo
There's nothing in this world that a nigga wouldn't do to
Satisfy - this my bitch that ride
My bitch wit the pistol in the ride
A nigga act up she busting, she ain't got to decide
No discussion, she'll put a slug in a tough niggaz muffin
You're fucking wit her husband

[Chorus]

[Verse - Obie Trice]
Come on and think about it
You got a ring about it
Nothing could ever come between or intervene our bondage
Drama we overcome it if we out numbered
I promise it'll be us against a hundred
Rushing to your side when you vomit eating pickles and peanutbutter
Eight months later Obie rubbing your stomach
Paying homage to your momma for raising a girl proper
Enough to call O her Baby Father
You ain't gotta bother bout a deal, I swear I keep it real
Raise young O trill and cook a decent meal
It's signed and sealed, you the only female
Hail, my one and only pal come to get me outta jail
Post bail and post up for sale
I swore, I swear we will always live well
Long as I got my bombshell from the hood to the hills
Who's gon stop up? nobody! we's that deal

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Eminem (Obie Trice)]
If you gon stand by me (if you gon stand by me)
Then I'm gon stand by you (then I'm gon stand by you)
If you promise you'll be true
Then I'll never put my hands on you (hands down)
But! don't you play me for no fool (no fool) bitch!
Cause if I put my mouth on you (on you)
After you put your mouth on someone else
Better find someone else new
Come on and think about it

[Verse 1]
My hoodrat's fatal, they not stable
I could be at a dinner table
with 'Union Gabrielle', fine as hell, pierce in the naval
Look at my rat like she act brand new
""Hey boo, how are you?""
Yeah, cool, now tally-o your ass back across the room
You see me with Pocahontas
I ain't tryin to be honorary but honestly I ain't tryin be bothered
You got a brain, define honors in college
You'd rather define how your knowledge in chronic
I'm tryin step my game up a notch bitch
Your aim the cock block on my plot bitch
She hot and your not, so stop bitch
Quit blowin up my motherfuckin spot, shit

[Chorus]
How could you be here? Why don't you leave here
I ain't tryin to see you everytime at my show
I got a piece here, you ain't gotta speak there
You know how we get down on the low
Your playin me cheap here
Tonight I don't drink beer
I got a bottle, so it's time for you to go
You's the freak here, you don't know me here
She's a model, you my late night ho

[Verse 2]
They chase me (Obie, Obie), when they see me in the club
With a lot alike Stacey Dash, they gettin mad
Then they want to brag and say ""already had 'em
He ain't shit cause he rap for Mr. Mathers (girl)
Plus 50 Cent's like ten times badder (girl)
D-12 shouldn't of had him on they album"" (girl)
That's what I get just for stabbin them hoes
They nag, when I pose with a chick with nice toes
Ya'll knew O before for new hoes, but since it's a new ho
Just act like you never knew O, boo
We still crew, we just the same (uh huh)
Just not tonight, you don't know my name (you don't know me)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Hey yo fellas, never get timid when the chicken is interferin
When your chillin with a chick, who a ten (damn)
Let her know the situation at hand (uh huh)
And tell the bitch go play with her friends (BITCH)
This is for the model that your chillin with, hoodrats is often awful
My advice keep your mouth on muffle
Feistiness give 'em the right to snuff you, and you too pretty to scuffle
This is for the rats, go on with that (go on)
Quit actin like you smokin that crack
Cause he pokin that chick, you ain't ownin on shit
Ain't no rings on that finger
And every nigga in the hood ain't triple teamed her

[Chorus]

[Obie Trice - talking]
That's right, ha, you see me at the club
with a, with a look-alike Halle motherfucker
Look alike, look a, look alike Alicia Keys
Haha, you don't know me
Don't say shit, you know who I'm talking to
All my hoodrat bitches
Neneh, Aqua and Trip Entanetta
Haha, all ya'll
I'm straight, Obie Trice",Hoodrats
Obie Trice,"Hey can we re, can we re-enact Biggie's song?
Can, can you shit on me?
I just want you to shit on me

Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby
I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend
If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions
I'll kill you, bitch I'm fuckin' for real
I'll make you suffer like I suffered
If you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love

Baby, I'm extra large in magnitude
And Magnum's the lubrication that I use
To chose which hole on a hoe I abuse
Have 'em confused, can't tell who is who

When I fuck the shit out you, then the next day
I rush the shit out you off my two-way
You wanna cuddle, emotional hustle up on Pocono's
Poke ya nose in and outta Obie's own

No, I'm in and out your home
And this in and out your tone
I ain't the nigga that settles 'em down
Put 'em in nice homes and floss 'em around

I bounce 'em around, camcord the sex and sell 'em around town
Now how that sound?
If I was in love witcha, now you wanna clown
Fuck with them clowns until I pound on your crown

Bust a few rounds and the cops come and get me
Bad mouth a nigga just to convince a jury
You don't want it with me, you just horny as me
You want a nut, nuttin' but what is you be

I'm internationally known baby but actually
There are few people who know how I am naturally
All you know is that I can act irrationally
When you shove a puppet up in my face on national TV

So they label me this crazed loony rap bully
But truthfully that ain't the truth
And if you believe in that shit then you'll believe anything's true
And you're too stupid to ever get to know me personally

But personally that actually works for me
'Cause the last thing that I need's a string attached to me
I'm a bachelor bitch and I ain't in no fast fury
To run out and find a new Mrs. Mathers

'Cause see, technically me and Kim ain't back fully
But we do still make booty calls occasionally
But be damned if I end up back in that pattern
And we end up back at that God damn tavern

And havin' another déjà vu, we seein' security
Pass my pussy around like it's Ja Rule's jewelry
I got news for you bitch, your new curfew's early
You ain't home by 2:30

Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby
I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend
If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions
I'll kill you, bitch I'm fuckin' for real
I'll make you suffer like I suffered
If you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love

See you lookin' at the life, you lookin' at the lights
You lookin' at the ice, you ain't lookin' at the Trice
You should look at some advice when I see he ain't nice
Despite the fact you think you the feisty type

Oh, love to fight, I love the drama
Love when my bitch get to cussin' out Yolanda
Find the Obie condom on the counter
Swingin' her weave, can't breathe like I can't believe

Least I ain't deceive and try to mislead
And sell a dream just to get you on my team
I came clean to keep down the beef
Keep down my reach, you can keep all your teeth

So what we do under the covers should stay between the covers
And the two of us and we ain't gotta be news coverage
On the front page cover of ""Buzz's New Lovers""
And this is when the bitch get to showin' the true colors

'Cause the truth of it, everything that I do's public
And you'd love it if you could run and tell all your friends
Guess who you just screwed, assume it's me and you've done it
And save da used rubber to show 'em the proof of it

But I guess it's do unto others as you'd have 'em do unto you
But you better be careful of who you're doin' it to
'Cause you never know when the shoe
Could end up on the other foot and it backfires on you

'Cause you may think you want it then you want me, then you get me
Then you got me and you're fucked, 'cause you'll be stuck with me
For the rest of your life 'cause if I get attached to you
We'll be joined at the hip, I'll be so latched to you

You'll be walkin' out the house and I'll run up and tackle you
Chain your ass up to the bed and shackle you
You don't think you're leavin' this house in that, do you?
Not till I brand my name in your ass and tattoo you

Have you walkin' out this bitch in turtleneck sweaters
Scarves and full leathers in 90 degree weather
Front on me? Never
'Cause we gonna be together forever
Right bitch? Right bitch?

Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby
I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend
If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions
I'll kill you, bitch I'm fuckin' for real
I'll make you suffer like I suffered
If you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love",Lady

Know what I mean (never forget ya)
I've been seein the struggle my nigga (*harmonizing*)
I'm rest to go, rest to go, haha (*never forget ya - repeats*)
I'm rest to go
The color ain't purple, the color is green
And lets get this money
Hop-o, haha, yeah

Obie Trice,"[Verse 1 - Obie Trice]
Yeah, Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks
I came in the game, profane no image
I came in the game, with a name
I was given from a mayn who ain't give a fuck about his child-ren
I proclaim the name though, never in vain no
Watch the change grow, a young nigga who didn't gain from fame
Copped the Range Ro', now they want my brains on the main road
They don't understand what I came for
How I came fo', with a million sold
Who say you can't grow from mildew and mold
Gettin money like Ross Perot
I'm often told, a coffin's the routes I go
Oh that's the road you on, oh no
I'm down for the rifle, tone the fo fo
Don't ever try to send a nigga home, no no
I know you wanna catch me at Sunoco
Show me that your loco put holes in my photo
NOPE!, HOPE!, hold toast, no jokes, send slugs through your Polo
Just cause our thug roll solo
And po' zone grown folk, be a cold negro
Be-low, your grieved up people
Be-lieve that the boy see no evil

[Chorus - Busta Rhymes]
OHH! I had you yellin out when I backed a 30/30 Rifle
OHH! Too late for niggaz to get religious and start readin they Bible
OHH! See you can yell like other niggaz, your pickin a dirty psycho
OHH! See you should make peace instead of makin me become a psycho

[Verse 2 - Obie Trice]
I visualized it, O. Trice at 25 survived it
Bright but violent, invite the violence
Fist fight a fireman, be a tyrant
'Til these niggaz nights is silent
O. Trice from a trife environment
He 'Rock's the Mic' no sight of retirin
Maybe when the bank accounts light like a fire thin
I'm in the position to hire other clients then
Meanwhile I'm a virus like Iverson
A nigga crossover, Europeans admirin
And the soldier's retirin, I ain't buyin
Motherfuckers actin like you denyin them
Who tryin a nigga, who use buyers
I figure your crew tired, my trigger introduces VIOLENCE
Loose the sirus, you in hospital, orange juice and vitamins
No coke

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Obie Trice]
A derelict who inherited hustle
My heritage married the street struggle
Like a couple of a great unk's ago (yeah)
So this blood streams through my nuts
Seems like I wasn't in touch
When the teacher's ass spoke
Nope, naw I was just a preacher in oath
Sit on the bleachers and flip coke
The only reach you got through my dome
Niggaz yaffle so the gat'll be chrome
Pull the window raffle, so I scramble with a track and the phones (woo)
Fuck a act and a clone, this is actual happening's that's factual back in my home
This is rap, but I ain't rappin so you clappin the zone
Think we trapped in the act, for the sake of performin (nigga)
This is your warnin, run up on the wrong
And your tissue is burning a hundred degrees warm [Blaap]
O. Treezy's gone, my nigga Buzz bring the track back here for 'em
C'mon

[Chorus]",Oh!
Obie Trice,"Nah, we ain't goin 
I love bein hated, it great it
Let's me know that I made it
I wouldn't have it no other way
I wouldn't trade it for the world
Only let's me know that I'm loved
By so many other motherfuckers that ain't you
And as long, as you keep fuckin with us, we keep fuckin you up
And keep pullin the rug from up under you
And what's ever more fucked up, is we enjoy what were doin
So much there ain't nothin that we love more than +Pullin Your Skirts Up+
And exposin you hoes so much, people are startin to wonder
What's up with them fuckin one dough a man under-els
Do unto others of you will have done under you
So who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to
When someone runs up with a mask and puts a gun to you [gun cocks]
You will ask youself, how come your mans
Didn't enter that last round that he had in Curtis Jackson's ass while he had the chance
You keep askin us to keep it on wax but we can't
This is past any irrationalization
We have captured national media attention
Conversation is senseless, you can sense the tension start buildin
Soon as we enter the '106th & Park' building
Someone's gonna get killed and I swear to God
If someone so much as even touches one of my people
I'll put a million on his head
And you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it
But I'd rather rap than get into this gangsta shit
And it ain't because I'm a bitch
It's because I ain't a bitch, I don't endanger people that I'm with
I'm a general, I ain't Bush, I don't send my soldiers to war
I'm right there in the middle of the shit with 'em, so when I do get 'em
Orders to storm your headquarters, you'll be fuckin with a ..

Fuckin with a peacekeeper, see you the nigga that greet this lyrical meat cleaver
That I eat ya, niggaz wanna keep speakin, like it ain't even that deep
I got heat that'll sweep a niggaz street [explosion]
See I wouldn't fuck with me neither, only heaven can help ya
I'll be searchin for you longer than the ""Legend of Zelda""
Without a failure, there's gonna be hell to tell the
Captain that a bassett hound couldn't even smell ya
Body, when I hide ya, I be on that mob shit
You another Hoffa, under the Renaissance bitch
You get bombed like Lebanon [explosion] with my own tactic
I snatch your head like one of Saddam's kids

[Obie Trice]
Motherfucker, I'll handle you
We can have it out on any Avenue
A +Average Man+ flipped into an animal
Shoot out your mandibles
Cannons and ammunition, reload with precision
Nigga know the mechanicals
Break the pistol down, you should see them handles
The street taught the child, no read up manuals
Push your crack vows, young Nino Brown
Chasin green is the dream, when your young and brown
Bound to be a problem child, look what I'm involved in now
A 'Dozen Dirty' niggaz and they all get down
Dissolve any problem that enlarge with ours
When revolvers we said ""all men get down"" ([gunshot], c'mon)

[Kuniva]
While your punchin and tacklin punks
I'm handlin chumps, packin a pump
That's longer than the elephant trunk [gun cocks]
On the streets I'm a beast, I feast upon the weak
So speak beef, I'll shot you and scream ""increase the peace""
A monster, pistol packin pushin niggaz off they Hondas
Starve ya, get it crackin, yankin bitches for they ganja
Sneaky as fuck, I don't think mama beat me enough
When she was sleepin stuff, I was stealin the keys to the truck
Shut the fuck up, before you end up dead in the dump truck
Or in the streets takin a nap, bleedin and Lugged up
+Who Want What+ like M. Bleek, with this heat if you ten deep
Then fuck it, it will be ten sleepin [gunshots]

[Proof]
Know much about my a land ski
Don't tustle with my hand speed
Clutch your burner, bust it and watch your man bleed
We ferocious, toast no holsters
Approach us, throw heat straight from the soldiers (c'mon, [gunshot])
We the soldiers, ya'll the youngsters (ha)
Youngsters lungs puncture, dead in a dumpster [gunshot]
Upstairs the Munsters, hand full of drama
You scared of the drama, bomber the monster [gun cocks, boof]
I'm back nigga (woof), I reappear
Shoot like [gunshot], homie steer clear
Blackness, carcass covered with cat fish
We murkers with no purpose other than practice

[Bizarre]
There's three things I hate: liars, fakes and cheaters
Alcoholics, sluts and fuckin wife beaters
A gat that describes my life
I don't even know who song this is [Obie Trice]
Bitch, Bizarre don't give a fuck about no hip hop
At my release party in a pink tank top in Reeboks [laughing]
This Ja Rule beef I ain't gettin in
I'll meet an are & be	 singer to sing at my wedding
I turn your face into a fuckin meat patty
I'll fuck your mommy and go fishin with your granny

Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

Niggas is so gangsta, Niggas is thugs
Niggas'll spend their whole life peddling drugs
Slanging dope in hopes of one day being able
To own their own label and give the game up
Some niggas came up, some just didn't
That's just the way it is, if it ain't meant it, it just isn't
Some niggas'll get money and pay niggas to back em
So they can act up, feel comfortable, and rap tough
And that's as backwards, cause them niggas just gone keep coming back
And that's when extortion happens
You struggle to get free, I know how this shit be
You deal with anything to live legitimately
But you gone find if you do get in this industry
It's best to be business with me than against me
Niggas get behind mics and ain't even emcees
Niggas get on MTV just to diss me
This shit don't even piss me off
I'm laughing all the way to the bank
Watching the satellite from ma Bentley
And you niggas don't even got a car
You're so far under my radar
I don't even know who the fuck you are
To tell you to suck my dick while I'm pissing
I don't even listen to your shit to know who the fuck I'm dissing
And media just feeds into these feuds
Trying to add fuel to the fire
This little nigga Ja Rule talking bout he's gonna slap me
Nigga please, you gotta jump and swing up to hit me in the knees
I laugh at these magazines when they interview him
All they doing is making fake threats to us through them
And pussy you're not Pac, I knew him
Pac was a real nigga, you're just a fucking insult to em
It's too bad we had to fallout before he passed
If he could see this shit now, he'd be whooping your ass
You're talking to a pioneer who engineered this shit for 19 years
Who you got in your air? I don't even gotta say it, the fans know
Quit trying to be tough, nigga, you look like an asshole

What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
I said ""What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?""
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

They say why don't we increase the peace
The only piece increased is that which deletes your peeps
Cause niggas run mouths but they don't run streets
Till that 45 will cease the speech
Yeah, it's a shame how the beef'll creep
Could've reached the peak, now you're left with a horrible leak
I'm trying to be as bleak with my speech as possible
Just in case a nigga trying to throw me an obstacle
Nigga, I'm not boxing you, I'm hospitable
I put you in a hospital, that's how I get at you
Let the doc op on you, he don't rid you?
You back on the streets, I send another hit at you
This is not a hypocritical issue
I will critical condition your tissue
Give a fuck if all ten of them with you
I throw an extra ten of them missiles
Turn gangstas into gentlemen, vicko
And ever since Eminem dissed you
I swear I see the woman and bitch in you
All this bickering back and forth over who signs who
Curtis pulled your skirt up, nigga, you got murdered
Now take it like a man and shake it off, damn!
And quit telling all these magazines your plans
How you gone slap up my mans, you're fictitious
Nigga, we'll send Stan to come murder your bitches

What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

Obie Trice,"Bitch I see you
'Cause you know I know you
Yeah, I know you

Last time I saw you, you was brewed up, booed up
Ready for a new fuck, last time you saw me
I was P I to the motherfucking M P, what
And lately I heard you's a broke bitch
Livin' in the lower class suburb
And lately the word is I live in a suburb
And I don't fuck with birds
She used to pump on the block
Sell a nigga' rocks, bail a nigga' out but
She tried to plot on a nigga'
Vacant lot, one shot, bitch died, go figure
He used to pay this bitch, gave her lots of shit
Fuck's wrong with this nigga' man?
He used to bring through the hood
Treat the bitch to fuckin' good, my opinion
We used to blaze with the bitch
Faded off the lick, she x-rayed the clip
This nigga bought braids for the bitch
Louis Vuitton kicks and tricked on suck shit
Meanwhile in the hood, she drivin' around good
This bitch thinks she in Hollywood
Meantime she settin' the nigga' up
Tellin' us, what his stuff
She's ready to get him stuck, what

Thick thighs but she full of surprises
I swear this bitch is Shady
(That's what I know)
Sex on her mind, all the time
And you think that that's your baby
(You don't know)

You a good guy that's livin' a lie
But she dove and played your safety
(It's what I know)
If you cool and she satisfied
How come that bitch just paged me?
(You don't know)

We had to ride on a nigga'
Watch him for the right time to get richer
We decided when the hit was
Run up on him, forty-five in the ribs, what
This nigga' screamed like a bitch
Showed us what his shit hit her
Hell of a lick but the bitch
Who told us 'bout the bricks
Exposed us to the nigga'
He knew that we'd come
But meanwhile in his hood
His niggaz is suitin' up
And Timbed, looted up
Rims and new trucks your man, 'Livin' It Up'
Then a van with no hubs
Suddenly pulled up and erupt
Shot a nigga', the fuck up
Just my luck, the bitch got us both touched
It's like a rush, the bitch who blushed
And smoked blunts wit us
Turned out to be nuts, switched up
Mixed up wit the wrong slut
Got my friend zipped up in the bag, it's all bad
My niggaz got my back, in fact they caught
On her Ave, flossin' in another nigga' cab

Thick thighs but she full of surprises
I swear this bitch is Shady
(That's what I know)
Sex on her mind, all the time
And you think that that's your baby
(You don't know)

Obie Trice,"I done did my share of dirt, flipped my share at work

I'm just rambling, y'all dick handling
Telling my past and you don't know me

If a massive ass kick's inflicted
It can happen that quick, when spitting shit
Rapidly laying down your fag ass click
From running your lips like a bitch
All I know is something it gotta give
Niggas I gotta live, it's not a pejorative
Don't speak on The Kid
Lid your speech or rid ya in the streets
It's so optional, but I will be logical
'Cause when I lodge at you, it's not hospital
Operating poppin' them hot slugs outta your abdominal
Now your momma got a funeral attending
Just for mentioning Obie Trice the Henchmen

Channel Two anchors won't cover the news

Like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and
Let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn niggaz' moms
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggaz' vibes
Everybody running for their motherfucking lives
Tough club niggaz, we leave early, cock back surely
Open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city pave
Your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z
Ho's in animal skirts get mirked
Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
Don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard

That's a stereotype like everyone that's black can jump
I'm in a white mink, the fabric is done
Cop rings like Mike, Larry, Magic and them
Out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm the clouds, you don't see me in the train
I travel first class, you ain't even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name, cause I ain't going back and forth

When I retire I'll be spitting baby food on people
At San Ysidro Ranch, huddled up next to her
With Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs
You ever had your cap peeled back, or your shit pushed in?
I put my blade in you like a fucking pin cushion
Slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and indo

I got a 12 gauge Mossberg to pump up your chest
Have you gasping for air after that shell hit your vest
Fear me like you fear God cause I bring death
Silverback gorilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest around you know how I get down
I watch gangster flicks and root for the bad guy
And turn it off before the end cause the bad guy die
If you trying to buy guns, I'm the nigga to look to
So what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new
You can raise your voice like you fiendin' to touch something
When I raise my knife, shit, I'm fiendin' to cut something

If the bitch think I love her, then the bitch don't know me

Baby I'm feeling the feelings you giving, I'm feelin your style
And I'm willing to let my guard down to figure you out
I'm picturing your figure in a swimsuit wiling
Somewhere in the Caribbean Islands
Cause the vibe you giving me now
Feels like I'm an innocent child
Sinning is never tempting when other women's around
Hands down, this is my vow
I never heard a moan sound so profound
When a nigga's digging you out, phone rings
You cuss them motherfuckers out, quit calling the house!
If I call, you're in route
There's a drought, you look out
I'm on edge, you put the palm of your hand on my head and squeeze
Please believe I ain't scared of commitment
Fuck head from them bitches!
When you could do the same, but that respect is given
Our intimacy is significantly different

Then I'm gon ride for you (I'm gon ride)
If you put your mouth on me (put it on me)

Together there ain't nothing we can't do (there's nothing)
Any problem we can see it through (we see it through)
Baby if you promise to be true (you promise?)
I will never put my hands on you

We got it all chalked out when we see each other under them covers
You my lover, I'm your friend, I'm your man, but I'm sayin
Who needs a label, we roll hand in hand
Visions of you having my little man
We joke, you call me George Foreman
Cause I'm namin him O number four, me I'm three
Plus the ol' G like the personality, she say it's meant to be
I'm in the bathroom when you pee
She in the bathroom too when a nigga doo doo, you my boo boo
There's nothing in this world that a nigga wouldn't do to
Satisfy - this my bitch that ride
My bitch wit the pistol in the ride
A nigga act up she busting, she ain't got to decide
No discussion, she'll put a slug in a tough niggaz muffin
You're fucking wit her husband

Come on and think about it
You got a ring about it
Nothing could ever come between or intervene our bondage
Drama we overcome it if we out numbered
I promise it'll be us against a hundred
Rushing to your side when you vomit eating pickles and peanutbutter
Eight months later Obie rubbing your stomach
Paying homage to your momma for raising a girl proper
Enough to call O her Baby Father
You ain't gotta bother bout a deal, I swear I keep it real
Raise young O trill and cook a decent meal
It's signed and sealed, you the only female
Hail, my one and only pal come to get me outta jail
Post bail and post up for sale
I swore, I swear we will always live well
Long as I got my bombshell from the hood to the hills
Who's gon stop up? nobody! we's that deal

But! don't you play me for no fool (no fool) bitch!
Cause if I put my mouth on you (on you)
After you put your mouth on someone else
Better find someone else new
Come on and think about it

Yes, it's O. Trice, I done jumped outta heights
Right into the microphone life, yea this is right
This is less strenuous niggaz, this is tight
This is more dividends niggaz, get it right
Stompin' like Timberlands niggaz, a pair of Nikes
But this is more Timbaland nigga and Obie Trice
The combination is invadin' the stations, air waves
And rest haven on your listener's membranes
I done paid some change, I got Timbo
This is not a brainy thang, yo this is simple
Get your ass up and dance to the tempo
Exchange your stiff frame for that of a more limbo
Grab shorty sippin' on that Shirley Temple
With that ass hangin' out, and pinch her on that pimple
On her ass hangin' out, nigga advance
This a world of a night, better start with the pants

In these days and times got my shit growin'
And she's hoein' and I'm ignorin'
The lies she throwin', how she won't perform?
I feed her a blunt, throw on the, ""Quiet Storm""
She repeatedly cum, consistently all morn'
And she heated cause funds up in the purse not growin'
Bitch, beat it, my one's, you gets none
She feel she's treated as if her playboy will play her dumb
I skeeted some bitch, her playboy is on the run
Deleted the bitch, outta direct connection

Oh no, hoes up, hoes, I spit it bitch
Roll up, smoke up dro, and spit on this

And squirt liquid in your eyes, all you see is little guys
Swimmin' in women claimin' they like my style
Treat 'em like, ""Ike"" and ride
I don't give a fuck, I got the height, sure you're right
I'm Barry White tonight, you feelin' alright
Got a buzz and this huzzie sayin' O's her type
I take her to the high end and strike
Trick for hire, I'll never buy her to bite
Despite she tight, I'll tell the bitch, ""You can have a nice life""

Obie Trice,"Woo, damn
There's a lot of bitches up in here tonight boy
I'm about to get drunk
Let's hold down
Where the bar at?

Okay, okie dokey Obie's here
No more focus, hobo's got a career
And I like your brassiere and there's a party in here
And I'm ready to talk naughty in Veronica's ear
She erotic and it's hot, saw a Heineken beer
Put it to the side and invite here to ""Cheers""
Pull up a chair, nigga swear no drama
Prepare for a player, who workin' with a monster
I ain't got time to waste, let's vacate the place
Shut blinds and drapes, grind to your face in a grimy state
Concentrate, you will find that your bound to get
But we found what's fate
We can watch two incredible mates masturbate
Why settle and wait, let's Escalade to the nearest Super Eight
Until your rear is on the mirrors and they smearin' booty cheeks
Come on

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huh)

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huh)

Okay holy moly derriere
Look around the club booty everywhere
And she caught me starin'
And my homies darin' me to approach Karen
She's model material, but she got a venereal
Tons of baby fathers', baby bottles and cereal
She holla 'cause I got a lot of DeNiro (DeNiro)
The DJ's playin' Obie's song on the stereo
And she's impaired and she wants to be headin' home
With the real thing not the dildo clone
And I know I don't want to be headin' home
With some double D's full of silicon
Ten hood rat chicks surround me outside
Found me outside, clown me outside
'Til I pop the trunk and they found me outside
Bustin' at the bitches screamin' ""off to they rides!""

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on

Okay rolie polies everywhere
Gotta find a slim chick's atmosphere
Obesity's glarin' and she got me fearin'
She's gonna come over here and try to eat me literally
Like a box of Cherrios
Carry cupcakes and chocolate Tootsie rolls
I'm outta order cause I gotta big girl disorder
So better cover up that blubber or I'll split
And I ain't got time to play
Let's investigate another place today
Ladies less in weight and the dress they shape
Dresses petite, no window drapes

Word to mother, they god damn Okra and beans
Got ya Oprah and jeans
Seems to me a little lean cuisine
Wouldn't hurt much, hot don't touch

Ha ha, ha ha, ha

Look, me big lips
You no teeth, it wouldn't work
You know what I'm sayin'
Yeah
I'm feelin' good
Shady Records man
Obie Trice, come on",Got Some Teeth [Dirty]
Obie Trice,"Yeah
Yo, let's bring it

What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
I said What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

Niggaz is so gangsta, niggaz is thugs
Niggaz'll spend their whole life peddlin drugs
Slanging dope in hopes of one day bein able
To own their own label and give the game up
Some niggaz came up, some just didn't
That's just the way it is, if it ain't meant it, it just isn't
Some niggaz'll get money and pay niggaz to back em
So they can act up, feel comfortable, and rap tough
And that's as backwards, 'cause them niggaz just gone keep coming back
And that's when extortion happens
You struggle to get free, I know how this shit be
You deal with anything to live legitimately
But you gone find if you do get in this industry
It's best to be business with me than against me
Niggaz get behind mics and ain't even MC's
Niggaz get on MTV just to diss me
This shit don't even piss me off
I'm laughin' all the way to the bank
Watchin the satellite from a Bentley
You niggaz don't even got a car
You're so far under my radar
I don't even know who the fuck you are
To tell you to suck my dick while I'm pissin
I don't even listen to your shit to know who the fuck I'm dissin
The media just feeds into these feuds
Tryin to add fuel to the fire. This little nigga, Ja Rule
Talking bout he's gonna slap me. Nigga please
You gotta jump and swing up to hit me in the knees
I laugh at these magazines when they interview em
All they doin is making fake threats to us through em
And pussy you're not Pac, I knew em
Pac was a real nigga, you just a fuckin insult to em
It's too bad we had to fallout before he passes
If he could see this shit now, he'd be whoopin your ass
You're talkin to a pioneer who engineered this shit for 19 years
Who you got in your ear? I don't even gotta say it, the fans know
Quit tryin to be tough, nigga, you look like a asshole

What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
I said What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

They say why don't we increase the peace
The only peace increased is that which deletes your peeps
'cause niggaz run mouths but they don't run streets
Till that 4 5 will cease the speech
Yeah it's a shame how the beef'll creep
Could've reached the peep, now you're left with a horrible leak
I'm tryin to be as bleak with my speech as possible
Just in case a nigga tryin to throw me an obstacle
Nigga, I'm not boxin you, I'm hospitable
I put you in a hospital, that's how I get at you
Let the doc op on you, he don't rid you?
You back on the streets? I send another hit at you
This is not a hypocritical issue
I will critical condition your tissue
Give a fuck if all ten of them wit you
I throw an extra ten of them missiles
Turn gangstas into gentlemen vicko
And ever since Eminem dissed you
I swear I see the women and bitch in you
All this bickering back and forth over who signs who
Curtis, pull your skirt up, nigga, you got murdered
Now take it like a man and shake it off. Damn
And quit tellin all these magazines your plans
How you gone slap up my mans, you're fictitious
Nigga, we send Stan to come murder your bitches

What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
I said What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

Hahahahahaha
Yeah, yeah
Go out behind all the gangstas you want, nigga
Matter fact, go get every gangsta from every hood
In the United States of America to back you, nigga
Ain't nobody rap wit you
You can't see that?
Fell off, nigga
Hahahahahaha

What's my name? You know that, what's yours? Never mind
Girl get ya behind in my ride and let's glide on 24's
I'm up in the club with a bottle of bub
Got a model and I double up, and you know it's like that
They wanna give a nigga the goods, wanna give the goodies up
And make for a night cap, tell me what excite that
With that nice ass, make a nigga say ""gon' girl""
Make a nigga wanna put you on chrome, take a bitch home
Get it on toes curl, why don't come and hop in O's world
Got the old school parked in the back where the gats at
Where the yack's at, access, got 'em on the way to the mattress
Pass that, toting hey in the vehicle, two broads with no bras
No draw's, no flaws, nope no law, I dips out in the car like what?

[Chorus]
Got a gang of bitches, getting them riches, sitting on 24's
Living that life those, that chrome always rolling different from yours
Slow ya role, you know them po po love to get a nigga in a Chevrolet fo' do'
But I get so low, so low low, so low on them ho's

Dipping through the hood on them thangs with a full tank
Gotta pull rank, with my hand on that 45, fuck what a fool think
Try to take a nigga life when the night come, I'm a light some up like a flare gun
Nine millimeter bare bellum, holding a melon, nigga at the right one
Now a niggaz on the right hunt, got a nice type honey and we into seeing ice and
Bitches wanna get the right come, Trice is the type that lay pipe like python
Parallel to a pipe line, carousel kinda clockwise, switch 'em in and outta my ride
Get you for them inches I got, hop in the 350 block, let's roll

Hop in the tre-nickle-o-six-four, AC blow, you be nice and cold
Ice on my neck like zero below, she zero in on O, nigga froze a ho
Pedal to the medal, we off to the mo', bitch get sentimental, fuck the ho
Got an issue, he ain't gon' miss you, gotta shit slew of bitches, wishing to fit ya shoes
Ridiculous how I give 'em exit wounds, disrespect, singing an O sex tune
That's a bet, better yet, Dev is next, get her in the bed and her head is Pez
Best believe that I'm wearing the dress, panties wet, got her in the fanny yep
Fuck it at the rest stop, getting head in the candy Lac on camera

I'd like to reintroduce myself, ha ha
If you don't know by now. It's Obie Trice man

I came from nothing solo, straight outta the dumpster hobo
Made up my monster, I was cultivatingly slanging that cocoa
Hated the po po, locally known as abominable snow-o
Later the pig fo' rated the home where I made the dough grow
So on and so fo', the story of us urban negros
Created as equals we wouldn't have to be so eager to mistreat you
We as a people heated in evenings doing these evils
Gotta eat you, be cool, got a kid to feed that'll reach you
Or did it see through? Or do I just speak through the EQ just to say I got a hot sequel
When niggaz on the block gotta eat, gotta cop, gotta cot when they caught by the cops
Young Tupac's, laid in the box or they age in a cell blocks, fade away
Brick walls, steel gates, can't wait for the day to be free, that's why I'm

[Chorus]

Seen it, I done ate it, I done shit it
Slept it, lived it, now I spit it
Shady

Working that house off an no-doze, got an ounce to roll on
Trying to get rid of the pounds, I gotta whip the bounce, I gotta put that chrome on
Same old song, young nigga that's trying to get some where I come from
Funds, need 'em in abundance, whole bunch, only way a city boy function
In conjunction with selling this substance
Chips stay up, fuck it, glucks keep coming, take another pie out the oven
I'ma be hugging these corners till these corners corner me
But currently, I'm calculating this currency, urgency
Gotta earn a G, uphearnestly, up early when the birds'll sing
It's an emergency, never did occur to me, that the first and the third'll be
Such a thirst for me, life almost took a turn for the worst for me took to see
I finally had a purpose on Earth's surface the seed that was birthing me
[Obie] Gotta do a little soul searching and [Obie] myself personally
And to think all Em had to hear is one verse from me
To confirm and unblur my dreams
Best believe since burst on the scene, I'm a be here certainly
With no uncertainties, yes indeed, I'm a get this cheese and that's why he's

[Chorus]

That's why I'm
That's what made me
Ha ha
That's why I'm

Get up and get yours nigga

I see you
Get up and get yours nigga
Ain't no looking back now",Ballad of Obie Trice
Obie Trice,"Yeah
Ride wit me
Come ride wit Trice, man
I brought my man wit me
Curtis Interscope Jack (ha ha)
Mr. Mathers, my nigga Fif' yeah
Holla at 'em

Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie
Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie

They say Obie Trice gone, look at em
Back then I was Mike Jones, who would even look at 'em?
Now I recite songs with icons, see I come from convicts and crumbs
My nigga, listen, his transitions shows his ambitions
Nuttin less then the man getting off his ass and vanishing
Into the world of ass kissing, witness him with Ashton Kutcher
Now they ask for pictures, autographs, signatures
Went from rags to riches to getting ass from bitches
It's hard to grasp the situation at hand
When you used to have to ask for digits
Now they pass em to you like easy fast for tickets
Classic isn't it? Coming from a past with a casket
Dips from beneathe the grass, so you're cremated to ashes
Nigga, created from the Craft, this is past fictious
Fif, tell em how we was when we last wen' visit

Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie
Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie

And now the spotlight's on Trice
But back when the spot life was Trice
I always kept beside a spot for a mic, despite
Wrongs and rights, I would write after I slung white
To homes on the pipe, I had a notion I would be bi-costal
But being across the ocean is la vida loca
And vada loco, I'm in Janayo
Konecheewa in Tokyo, it's sushi with eel
I got a taste for that pompies chopping up in Brazil
Drinking the finest wines in France on the hill
Now how real is he to come from where we get killed
To having all his dreams fulfilled, look out
I got fantasies of being in Italy where the women be
Offering me the cooch-o, eating on ossobuco
Awesome, I know, so often, we just reach the coffin
And never get to see what the world's offering

Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie
Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie

Yeah
Things change man
You know, get a chance to travel
See the world and you start to look at things a lil different

Craft took my mind so the craft exploits me

[Chorus]

I got no pot to piss in, en route to prison
You don't want it with us nigga, we strapped with nitroglycerin
Our ambitions is some riders, thriving off poor decisions
A blessing nigga still living, still pimping, still visions of
Sitting in that foreign whip, whipping up cola take a lick
To my tongue, numb from the shit
My nuts hung since I was a young one
And that's just the slum fuck of it
I'm pumped daddy gone but, gun in my palm
My momma can't save me her gender is wrong
On my own in this jungle that niggaz call home
What? His momma died from a lump in her D cup
Police freeze 'em up for serving these glucks
It's like a habitual situation, we stuck
The ritual is for niggaz to grab they nuts
And just soak all this bullshit up, where I'm from?

[Chorus]

I'm from real bridge cause, for niggaz living hard
Welfare scarers just most chicks'll buy them broad
Pimping the government cause government pimping us
Rather see 'em suffering then niggaz live it up
Cause you ain't heard? Bird got birds
But the nigga got murd' cause niggaz felt he ain't deserve
What he was worth, he ain't a real nigga from the turf
He was birth with money, that's why they left him bloody
I'm from the streets where most these niggaz nutty
I adapt to em, I'm exactly in tuned with 'em
Strapped with the Mac that extract flesh from humans
Home sweet home, better known as The Ruins

[Chorus]

Hold you till the morning Obie
Know you got it going on Obie
Sex and on that good love to me

She say she like em dark skinn-ded
Not timid, wanna rumble in my loft is it
Talk different, her walk's exscusite
Switch is ridiculous, locks is twisted 
Like a block she said visit us
Jamrock why don't you picture us, with
Kids or whip, a ton of cannabis
So I can can it on a canoe
Sippin coconuts like its a can of some brew
I'm what she plan to hold on to {she say}

[Chorus]

Haters wanna hate, hey no way, hey
She'll slit ya throat, mess around with O
She move a pound of coke, like brown with hopes
Of being close to folk, if you clown ya poked
No joke, murder she wrote, provoke me no a rotty
Be a dead body, it be that dread hotty
Me no know no one that more potty
Down on her knees, up in the party to please my body {she say}

I just want you in my arms Obie
Hold you till the morning Obie
Know you got it going on Obie
I don't hear what them rumble clots say (She say)
I just want you in my arms
Till the break of dawn we can get it on Obie
Ain't no need to prolong Obie
Realest nigga on this song is Obie

Way she move, got me in her hypnotic ways
Her voice maneuvers, got me thinking bout her day to day
See I'm faced with beauty, there's nothing more for me to say
Put on the dance floor and play with Obie
And it's no cliche, O's great like the lake
So she pon'd the river her way of doing the snake
Jamaican God, make a true playa break
Say it ain't so, ya truth is fate
Incense lit when she's interested in insertion
Any minute ya squirting, she gifted in
Giving you the business, hurting em
Plus she know that art of perversion {she say}

Obie Trice,"(From hard times)
All of my life, got this lady on my mind
(To good times)
All of my days, wanna hit it all the time
(She's fine)
Struggle and strife, I was down and locked away
(She's mine)
Thought about it every day
(From hard times)

You know a nigga wanna touch your body
We can keep in touch, have an after party
You know you wanna fuck 'cause you're acting naughty
You see us in the mattress probably

Wanna be involved 'cause the entourage I'm indulged in
You say you love my dirty drawers, you're all in
Wanna sleep with the star, be baby moms, eat lobster
See where you're coming from

'Cause hey, that nigga got dick for days
And ain't too many niggas blessed in O?s ways I guess
I just get better with old age
'Cause in my hey, puss made me say ?Mayday?

Anyway, today I'm a different human being
I crush 'em, make 'em scream
It's nothing, ain't a thing
Fronting like the dick ain't off the chain
Slicing nigga?s [incomprehensible], c'mon

(From hard times)
At the after party we can get naughty, watching your body
(To good times)
Get this shit started, coke and Bacardi, [incomprehensible] juice and gin
And I'm off that ready to roll
(It's high time)
At the after party, it?s a private party
What happens at the party, stays at the party
(Blue sky)
Girl go on and party, back up that body into my body, girl let's go
(From hard times)

You know I'm somewhere where I can ease my mind be
On some island Don Ps beside me
No paparazzi eying that hiney
But I am right behind she

Wanna bump 'n grind, crying, sayin' I'm all up in that side
Bringing down the menstruation cycle
Girl I lay pipe to the right, pipe to the left
Pipe all night, a pipe dream, right?

O Trice advice your type
If it ain't him, it?s a nigga in my click you like
If the misses insist on a dick tonight
We throw assists like Scott Pip and Mike

You blow a kiss on my tip you just might
Get a whiff of the kid up in your windpipe
Now see that insight? It excites
'Cause she's undressing for that sex, right?

(From hard times)
At the after party we can get naughty, watching your body
(To good times)
Get this shit started, coke and Bacardi, [incomprehensible] juice and gin
And I'm off that ready to roll

At the after party, it?s a private party
What happens at the party, stays at the party
(Blue sky)
Girl go on and party, back up that body into my body, girl let's go
(From hard times)

Take time off my hectic schedule
Just to give you the pleasure you request for
When I hit your spine that's how you measure O
Tell your girlfriends you ain't had it like this before

Now your girlfriends all up in the midst of O
Wanna be mistress, all 'cause a few extra inches
Blew back your interest, you lack experience
New jack my crew ran through that for instance

We can fuck from dusk to dawn
'S no discussion whose nuts you're on
To me she's such in a rush to cum
Wanna choke on the dong, like it?s a bong

And what is he doing? You're making her moan
You make her wanna leave that muthafucka she got back home
All O knowing is he keeps hoes going, enjoying O Trice?s groin

(From hard times)
At the after party we can get naughty, watching your body
(To good times)
Get this shit started, coke and Bacardi, [incomprehensible] juice and gin
And I'm off that ready to roll

",All of My Life
Obie Trice,"I told you, don't fuck with me, stupid fuck, look at you now

Yeah, ha ha, have you noticed like
When niggas go to the club, it's always
It's one knucklehead nigga always mean mugging and shit
Heh, he wanna, he wanna have contact with me
Have contact with men, all these bitches in here
Faggot ass, this for them hard head niggas man

Now I don't wanna come across as a boss some type of mafia
But these are my thoughts, they awful, I won't argue with ya
But see, I got a cause a clause, that I live by
Keep the heater close because I don't want to die

You see I'm from Detroit where they dump 'em off in coffins
And often there's assorted men where bullets holes departed him
And I don't want no parts of them, crazy complications
So I keep the heater cocked up in case of confrontation
And I would just be fakin' if I said I wouldn't erase him
If he blatantly, tried to take away God's creation

(I'll kill me a muthafucka)
Running up on me, may he, rest in peace once released
(I'll kill me a muthafucka)
Yeah, look at ya now, for running ya mouth, ya stretched on the ground
(I'll kill me a muthafucka)
Ain't no way you can stop it on that hot shit, we can get it popping
(I'll kill me a muthafucka)
I told you, don't fuck with me, stupid fuck, running ya mouth

Now I'm riding through the city in a Range with no tints
Just to show these muthafuckas, yes, I am a resident
I ain't stack up my pennies just to move out the city
So if you got a problem with me you should know where to get me

Niggas kills me, portraying that thug
My nigga, you's a crack baby, go smoke on some drugs
Before that hot piece of slug make you where you ain't budging
Don't even nudge him, it's over for cousin, he caught a dozen
Just for fucking with the wrong animal
Animated no more, off to hell, yes, I

(I'll kill me a muthafucka)
Running up on me, may he, rest in peace once released
(I'll kill me a muthafucka)
Yeah, look at ya now, for running ya mouth, ya stretched on the ground

Ain't no way you can stop it on that hot shit, we can get it popping
(I'll kill me a muthafucka)
I told you, don't fuck with me, stupid fuck, running ya mouth

When I'm down in ATL
Stat Quo keep my fo'fo' so shawty know Obie for real
When I'm chilling in L.A.
Dre keep my AK, so I'm like an esse when banging that steel
When I'm out in NYC
50 hold artillery for me watch me shut down son and dunny

Listen, o-bizzle, hold the tek-nizzle
Holding ya neck if you, disrespect bizzle
Sizzle up tissue, missles will not miss you
Maybe ya momma, when that pistol uplifts you

(I'll kill me a muthafucka)
Running up on me, may he, rest in peace once released

You could get popped, it's a possibility up in my vicinity
Poppin? off with that hostile energy, in a hospital
With a doctor getting in when adrenaline is mixed
With an obnoxious temperament

Honestly, I got a monster pistol gripped and I commence to spit
None of y'all exempt from it, spit, spit, passes from it
You get stiff from it, church man see your box plummet
And I will never let 'em give it to me

I gotta live to be one hundred and three
Gotta reach my epitome, wanna seize my enemy
And receive my penalty n****

Lay down
(Lay down)
I'm a man, man, I ain't runnin?
I'ma stand wit my gun in my hand
I got plans and a place to be

I ain't tryna cocky wit it but I'm a n**** from the block that did it
Got a nine that's livid, I ain't tryna see the box in prison
Getting knocked outta my position, now I got a pot to piss in
Pissed off motherf***ers' mouth off b****in

Probably ?cause he lack ambition, so his wack decisions
Get mad at the n**** that's getting 'em
That's when he see the next n**** that's hittin? him
With a vigorous pistol over this ridiculous issue

Dismiss you, in attempt to
Take me out my motherf***in tempo n****

Lay down

I'ma stand wit my gun in my hand

N****z get nauseated, a artist made it
Had it hard against odds and emancipated
To the floor I spit cause, god damn they hate it
To see the lady they dated caterin? to the latest

Shadiest artist, up in my radius
Get faded with a plated revolver
Rated me are, haters get faded with horror
Erased, no fate for tomorrow

All cause he think he hard tough
Got a car ?cause he was runnin? at the mouth, hush
I will never let 'em give it to me
I gotta live to be one hundred and three

Gotta reach my epitome, or decease my enemy
And receive my penalty, that'll be the end of he
Tryna seize my entities, finna be the end of his identity

Obie Trice,"Only my mama done seen me cry, this my life
I'll be thuggin' till the day I die, this my life
You niggas don't know me
You can't slow me down, you can't hold me
So I'mma keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' goin' on strong

They say why you so defensive? I take that offensive
Comin' from the shit that I lived in
You wouldn't understand him unless you eye witness
Chillin' on the block where vacant lots are given

Women and children, missin' men in the picture
These niggas hit up sittin' down at some center
Get a kite with a flick of a chick, he once hit up
Ridiculous but that's us niggas

On the corner from dusk to dawn
Till that shit whites brought to America's gone
Be a good Samaritan, my heritage was did wrong
So all that sufferin' that's just prolong

Long as you knowin' that strong arm robbery
Was brought on from this society deprivin' me
This brings violence if you're not survivin'
My environment, don't expect you to be drivin' in

Only my mama done seen me cry, this my life
I'll be thuggin' till the day I die, this my life
You niggas don't know me
You can't slow me down, you can't hold me
So I'mma keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' goin' on strong

Mama worked 37 years at the plant
34 days she missed, that's where I get my grind at
Her little nigga, see her as father figure
Even though she got hips and tender bitch up

Show me how to maneuver snakes far as niggas
Eleanor Trice, one real sister
Raised the kids up to be go getters
Now a nigga living room big as an ampatheater

Got the theater nigga, I'm from the hood
So at times I see the mirror and tell him he doin' good
Keep up my spirits 'cause niggas want him destroyed
But that's null and void when it comes to ya boy

I'm from Detroit, Shady employee
I'm on a voyage tryna get more than royalties
Niggas some royalty, that's why your bitches spoil me
O T are I see E

Only my mama done seen me cry, this my life
I'll be thuggin' till the day I die, this my life
You niggas don't know me
You can't slow me down, you can't hold me
So I'mma keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' goin' on strong

I got visions of makin' executive decisions
But the system tells me to be realistic
You can't do shit with see's and D's
I can do the work, I'm just interested in makin' cheese

So your schools can't control these G's
He got his own rules and do whatever he please
At ease to my soldiers that's feelin' Obie
Long as I know my 1, 2, 3's I'm flippin' OZ's

A nigga can count like an accountant
Only difference is it ain't checks thatta be bouncin'
It's powder, peep what he's pronouncin'
Now he lives next to the teacher that denounced him

Doubted him, now look at the child's outcome
Deuce album got 'em speakin' highly in volume
I assume I'm valuable, they throwin' in the towel
Bow whenever they see him rollin' at diablo

Only my mama done seen me cry, this my life
I'll be thuggin' till the day I die, this my life
You niggas don't know me
You can't slow me down, you can't hold me

",Mama
Obie Trice,"Momma's so proud of you, you did so good on that report card today baby
I'mma let you pick out whatever you want
Ma, I can get any shoes I want?
That's right, today is your day
Momma don't have much, but I'll spend it all on you today
Okay, I want these. Ah man, I'mma look fresh when I go to school

Such a beautiful thing, being embraced by a woman that's a queen
With big dreams for the younger sibling
O couldn't do no wrong
According to report cards Obie brought home
They say good in spelling
Spelling bee's always excelling
Which was so overwhelming that Momma took him shopping
Copped him the new Jay's
Swear to God homie this was Obie's cool days
BMX'ing up the block with the tennant living next to him
Shooting hopes, who got hops?
Worthy, when he pop a jump shot
No worries, just a pocket full of sugar or whatnot
Hit the candy house on the block
It was pickle in them spot
Then things turn around when Obie'll lay down
Hear the sounds of fire rounds surrounded em
Astounded him, the volume of the blast had me so interested
Momma falling with cash, she can't get a nigga in this bitch
They wanna hit the ass, nigga start ditching class
Dad ain't around, he left a nigga 
Sagging in them Superman drawers that one Saturday
Is it my fault, shit got dark?
Mom and I fall apart, relationship taunts, bad talk
""Can't stand you, looking like ya Daddy with that same walk""
Muthafucka you 
Now a niggas out in the streets
Two nickle plated thirty-eights on me
Can't stay away from beef
Scrapping with them niggas from the other side
Sipping Saint Ives rocking old school flannels
Old school niggas see that I'm an animal
Front me at 16, see how my roll handle
Now I'm up the O's but wait on the affy
'cause here come my muthafuckin baby, cool
Had to slow my role
Plus my P.O. got a nigga pissing in a bowl
Hold my temperament 'cause I see such innocence
When I'm looking in Kobe's pupils
Despite all the dope I sold I had to change my road
I just might be able to grow old
Older brother said, ""Yo O 
I'mma quit my job so we can chase our goals
I'll be manager-a-go, you can rap I suppose""
That's what we did, I still flipped a little bit
Saved up my chips and put it into music
""Well Known Asshole"" a underground hit
Still scrambling, looking like shit
Baby momma think I'm smoking more then a spliff
Think a blessing came from the man who invented my gift
When Eminem said ""let me hear you spit""
Wrote my signature, now Shady Obie represents
Hit em with the D12 skit
Can exhale now I see my Mom's ain't pissed
She hit em with a smile 'cause Obie became focused
From independent out the trunk like them dope kids
To platinum plaques, world tours, getting noticed
An inappropriate soldier became so ferocious
In this Hip-Hop culture that I long for
The roller coaster O was on so young
Took a turn right into his song
That's right, from after school fights
To pushing white, to pursuing his career heights
One mic's, all I need involved with beats
I'mma be the streets to Jesus, cars on me
And that'll be the day you applaud and see
The underdog gets his eventually

Gotta end it though
I'm all in it, there's no limits
And it's so splendid
Real names, no gimmicks
No image, just a soldier who spoke what he lived
From the ribs with it, the flows vintage
Obie gotta do this for real
Yeah

Only foniness never came to par 
He had us, a true neighborhood actor 
Had his back with K's 
Now we see through him like X-Ray's 
Cuffed in that Adam car 
No matter, his loss, we at him, it's war

We gon keep the grind up til death come find us 
Meanwhile leanin in them European whips reclined up 
It's an eye for an eye for the riders 
We ain't trying to get locked up, we soul survivors 
Po Pos is cowards, there's no you, it's ours

There they go, there they go

You are not convincin'
When detroit blocks stay flocked with henchman
Niggas get popped for instance
Infrared dot for distance
Get knocked by the cops, cop on some pension
Straight detention, a nigga doin' tension
Once released, he on that music business
Been viewin' 106 in them cafeterias
Only to find that raps actually serious
Deliriously so its back to crack and vigilance
Same shit to send them up in michigan
Us is pimpin', a difference from any city I've visited
Its that detroit spirit and if we in it
Ballin' out to the end, period
Use o' as the reference to that sentence
The message I'm sendin', you best just pay attention

There they go
Those d-town boys, carry the calico
Whenever there's war, you gots to know
Them boys got toys, tear down the front do'
Detroit make noise everywhere that we go
There they go, there they go

If you don't like how I act then blow me
I don't really give a shit, I represent the real cats who know me
Man what's up with that scratch you owe me
Now run my chips before we fall out like shaq and kobe
Big herk on a track with obie
When you come to the d, its cut throat, better be packin' homie
And niggas get they shit split for actin' phony
We're known for the glocks and the choppers
These niggas will rob you, leave you standin' in ya socks and ya boxers
We got real g's and lots of imposters
I smoke the real trees, see I cop from the rosters
Y'all niggas ain't impress me yet
Y'all yappin', not rappin', turn that shit off and press eject
See we known for the car shows, runnin' from the narcos
Keep them bottles comin', we gon' pop 'em till the bar close

There they go
Those d-town boys, carry the calico
Whenever there's war, you gots to know
Them boys got toys, tear down the front do'
Detroit make noise everywhere that we go
There they go, there they go

Meat cleaver, leave a gash in a bitches ass
She had dreams of being an r&b singer
Diva, leave her face cut up from the waist
Of me, what a waste of a pretty face
And this place ain't just safe, its just straight gangster
It ain't just new york or la that bangs no more
There's latin crown kings here, southside folk
Eastside them gangs and nothin' but gang lands and
Spray paint cans and when that van rolls up, man they ain't glancin'
That window rolls down and that trey . 8's dancin'
And them shooters don't miss homie, man they hate chancin'
Its straight for the dome and its vacate fast and
Get the fuck outta dodge 'fore that blue dodge flashin'
Red and blue lights, no ambulance you got flattened
And this was not supposed to be no detroit anthem
But just so you know if you see them d-boyz passin'

There they go
Those d-town boys, carry the calico
Whenever there's war, you gots to know
Them boys got toys, tear down the front do'
Detroit make noise everywhere that we go
There they go, there they go",There They Go

[Chorus]
",Violent
Obie Trice,"They say he was a monster from birth, so
Fuck it, I'll just a lean warn-os them hoes
I suppose O took on the street life
Even though my mother told me I could be otherwise
Wasn't the school type, I was too cool
My agenda wasn't general education, nigga
Generalizing Obie's expectations
It was like, a cucoo in twenty-twos
Bad news my nigga, pass the brew
Cause in a week we be pouring a glass for you
So rapidly homies become causualties
We was just playing Madden
Now a nigga sad for his family, that's how it happens
Dudes get blasted, another casket
Another child becomes a fatherless bastard
Make a nigga wanna grab this rachet
It's so tragic, and Obie can't get past it
And you wonder why a nigga'll flash it
Just to, show these demons that I ain't having it
Put 'em beneathe the grass in a flash
Homie I'm from the craft
And to make it where I'm at, that's called Soldierism
Real niggaz notice em, they wanna flow with 'em
Wanna do major shows with 'em
Get the fuck out the ghetto wit 'em
Heavy metal, leave a nigga twisted, don't fret
This is the set we live in
But I ain't crying or whining about my environment
Even though black folk is dying constant
Niggaz'll shoot you unconscious
Wit no conscience, until you lose conscience
Conscious, and pompous white folk think I'm just rhyming
Just designing lines, just for the sake of shining
Like I just speak violent applying to the business I'm in
Rewind and find him in a dirty ass hood with no sight of climbing
Moving on up was just The Jeffersons
Rest of us watching the tube got less then them
So why you vexing him? Why you stretching him out?
He got the weapon all because his whereabouts
Born and raised, mental slaves
And I don't see change before I'm seeing the grave
All I see is my homies corpse decay
Crying at his wake, can't recognize his face
Face it, you not identifying with me
My identity distorts ya visibility
So you can't see me, peep what he's achieving
You receive information from TV
I'm in the hood, I live it you read about it
Rest in peace Peezy
Please believe Obie eyes've seen The Wire
Prior to what you seeing on the screen
I done been in and out of the bing
Lost niggaz to unfortunate things
That's why, praise the Lord I'm still on the scene
Praise the Creator who made human beings
Just for creating a nigga like me
A nigga that put the umph in G, yeah

[Chorus 2X]
Wake up
I try to reach out but you won't
Wake up
My brothers and sisters, we got to
Wake up
'Fore you stuck in the system, and then ya
Wake up
Reality hits ya, before you can
Wake up

Can't explain the gift; but my aim is to take

And I ain't evaporate, I will remain the shit
So ya lames that got a problem wit the game - tough tit
He still in the same Range, windows fixed
And I'm killin' 'em come a-gain, that's as real as it gets
Off ya, tryna make me depart ya, from my thought-a
Coffin's for you, and the nigga that brought ya
The hatin' start in ya, release from our father
The people at the alter, saying ya better off
You don't wanna see a demon, come out of a humen being
Recent being the sience, and to him it's too extreme
Catch me in the BM, like Tupac and them
Or in that Tahoe like Christopher, no
Poppa gon' keep poppin' Cris on you hoes
And piss on those, who exist as my foes
O rolls through shit, spittin' cold flows
Knows his business, I'll be missed if I go
Who you know holdin' the city on his shoulders
Flow is ferocious, it's O shit, true vocalist, bitch!

Obie Trice,"[Intro]: 
{Convict} 
(Yeah, SHADY) 
{Convict Music} 
(Guess who's back) 
Still here, haters 
{Akon & Obie (Trice), Yeah} 
Whatcha gonna do it with it, A? 
Whatcha gonna do? 
{Take em on back to the streets} 

Akon [Chorus]: 
I keep the 40 cal on my side 
Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster 
See a nigga pass by 
Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya 
Got glocks for sale, red dots for sale 
Anything that you need, believe me, I'm gon lace you 
Just don't whatever you do, Snitch 
Cause you will get hit, pray I don't face you, yeah 

Obie Trice [Verse 1]: 
It's risky, the bitch tend to rise out a nigga 
It's history, Snitch, who decided he's a member 
Once he got pinched, coincided with law 
Same homie say he lay it down for the boy 
Brought game squad around ours 
How could it be? Been homies since Superman draws 
Only foniness never came to par 
He had us, a true neighborhood actor 
Had his back with K's 
Now we see through him like X-Ray's 
Cuffed in that Adam car 
No matter, his loss, we at him, it's war 
Knowing not to cross those resevoir dogs 
You helped plant seeds just to be a vegetable 
When we invest in team, it's to the death fo sho 
No ex and oh's, tex calicos 
Aim at your chest nicca 

Chorus:
I keep the 40 cal on my side 
Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster 
See a nigga pass by 
Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya 
Got glocks for sale, red dots for sale 
Anything that you need, believe me, I'm gon lace you 
Just don't whatever you do, Snitch 
Cause you will get hit, pray I don't face you, yeah  

Obie Trice [Verse 2]: 
We started out as a crew, in one speak, it's all honest 
Private conferences when we eat, Benihana's 
Recondences when we peep enemies on us 
Been on these corners, sellin like anything on us 
Knowing heaven has shown us being devil's minors 
That ain't got shit to do with the tea in China 
We gon keep the grind up til death come find us 
Meanwhile leanin in them European whips reclined up 
It's an eye for an eye for the riders 
We ain't trying to get locked up, we soul survivors 
Po Pos is cowards, there's no you, it's ours 
We vow this, mixing yayo with soda powder 
Who woulda known he would fold and cower 
Once the captain showed, he sold whole McDonalds 
So no exs and ohs, tex calicos 
Aim at your chest nicca 

Chorus:
I keep the 40 cal on my side 
Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster 
See a nigga pass by 
Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya 
Got glocks for sale, red dots for sale 
Anything that you need, believe me, I'm gon lace you 
Just don't whatever you do, Snitch 
Cause you will get hit, pray I don't face you, yeah  

Obie Trice [Verse 3]: 
Nowadays, Sammy Da Bull's got the game full 
So he move to a rural area to keep cool 
He snitchin on a snitch now, there's nothin to tell 
Nowadays, your circles should be small as hell 
Ain't tryin to meet new faces, this don't interest me 
Even if we bubble slow, we'll get it eventually 
No penitentary, there will be no climacy 
You will meet the lowest snitch in given us a century 
These cats is rats now, the streets need decon 
That's how they react now, weak when the heat's on em 
Stop snitchin, you asked for the life your living 
This act is not permitted, Nowhere on the map, It is 
Forbidden to send a nigga to prison if you been in it 
Along with em and then snitch and become hidden 
So it's no exs and ohs, tex calicos 
Aim at your chest nicca 

Chorus:
I keep the 40 cal on my side 
Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster 
See a nigga pass by 
Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya 
Got glocks for sale, red dots for sale 
Anything that you need, believe me, I'm gon lace you 
Just don't whatever you do, Snitch 
Cause you will get hit, pray I don't face you, yeah

Obie Trice,"I have been shut by my critics
Talked about by my scenics
Feel like my life is on this ? 
Like those you see on exhibits
Puts my life on the line
And ? on these lines
? hear my bottle cry
I wanna see them? 
I wanna see them ? 
Kill the Patrick be next to them
Savage put them into an ? 
Bring the city to the masses
? like my past ? I kind of work he ? 
Let them pout a nigga in the trash
Never mind a ? you could ? my name still the same
 
Keep going keep going on
This is my battle cry
Keep going keep going on
This is my battle cry
 
Waiting patient in the dark like ? 
Circus ? my wings have been clipped
But now I am ready to fly in the heavens with angel
? devil died
Never come back all I ever gain is crack
Say opposite to that ? I know how to double up
? emerge from that used to ? worship onions not
? rather see him serve ? like I deserve them curses
Like I don't speak cursive
Like I don't have a purpose
 
Keep going keep going on

You play it, you bump it, you know it, it's crazy
Hate if you wanna, that don't phase me
I ain't going nowhere right now

It's the fo' pound bandit
The coke hand to hand, and he Detroit bredded
Goddanmit O Trice's back
And Oh, they so adamant I'm still at it
You should see the grill on a faggot if only looks could kill
But O is so accurate over this matter stagnant
It's never inadequate I swear these haters need to chill
It's SO automatic that he is above average
Jesus of Nazareth's reached his soul and so
He is a talent that has managed to mechanically use a pen and a pad and the alphabet to get ahead
Niggas mad cuz he single handledly getting this bread
Bitches is in his bed, bullet still in his head
I'm back, fully loaded I'm ready to let off lead
Metal is heavy and I'm ready to let it all rip
The return of the vigilante on that big party and bullshit
You dig? The kid's back you biatch

You heard it, you want it, you got it, it's crazy
You play it, you bump it, you know it, it's crazy
Hate if you wanna, that don't phase me
I ain't going nowhere right now

I don't suffer the whispers of these envious niggas
Mad cuz his nuts not in my Denim
Wanna be him so much the send slugs to kill him
And keep it on the hush not to become a victim
Vicious, niggas I rid them
I spit, piss on the statistics on that bullshit
I pull up muzzle yell, send the bezel berg back to here
I'mma thug, I'mma clap him till he fail and he fall
I'mma ball, I'm a beast, I'm the streets
I'm the reason you a broad, I'mma boss, I'm me
Obie bout that change, get rich fast
The Claude Van Damme of the game: Kick ass
Trapped until a nigg get out of 'Caine
And bounce back like whiplashes
And dump my cigar ashes on you asses
It's still Trice and Mathers all that matters
Call that other madness, past us
This is passion

You heard it, you want it, you got it, it's crazy
You play it, you bump it, you know it, it's crazy
Hate if you wanna, that don't phase me
I ain't going nowhere right now

My feet up, I read up
Read up on a MC who fordid, a overachiever
My Visa tease them in that villa overseas in that B1W with mamacita
G'd up, Jesus my cheese keep reaching up
Planted the seed and then it beamed up
The bean stalk being tall
Now I'm balling on these motherfucking peanuts
Huh, the demons wanna deliver me
Wanna deem him less than enemy but O too slippery
But back on you faggots nigga ain't no sympathy
I don't fuck with you actors I do mine differently
Trice made history, now all these fake niggas wanna mention me
Couldn't wait till I break in this with my entity
It don't even interest me, I'mma keep my energy spitting
Obie is in this to win this and that's the ending

Obie Trice,"Yeah
Trice
Statik Selektah

O back around the corner
Got the crack, put in your orders
We ’bout to run up out the stores
It’s notorious, the way I got big spitting stories
Being me’s X-Clan, Vanglorious
We’re not your favorite, fuck it
You know the system and you buck it
Have you revisiting how you used to love it
A nigga spew through the music, acoustics, cool kid
Used to pursue excuses, truth is, I was truent in school
So its influence is foolish, that was my views
I’m back at it, the rap addict, by any means
We gon get these stacks accurate, no skinny jeans
Say he ain’t a star, niggas might be right
I’m so regular, nigga gotta shit tonight
Take it back Selektah, let ‘em know it’s Trice
Put your seatbelts on, we gon’ ride tonight

And I would like to introduce myse-self
Surprise! Hi, it’s Ike
‘Bout to get my Ike on, I come with a life supply
Of wife beaters and my Nikes on
And a white tee over that Iron Mike
Lookin’ fly tonight, feel like I might die from a spider bite
Come back as Spider-Man, Park my Peter inside a dyke
Bitch actin’ like she got fuckin’ higher standards than Meijer’s, right
Had to pry her fingers off the motherfuckin’ Breyer’s ice cream
With the pliers, like “AAHHH!”
Only a ruthless bastard would do this
Take a toothles bitch with no taste buds to Ruth Chris
Give her toothpicks, stop on the way home
Pick up two Big Bufords
Girl, you got a nice pair, but you’re plum stupid!
So when I pull up in that Benz
Don’t try to pretend you ain’t interested
To impress your stupid ass friends
And refuse to get in woman, and get slammed on the ground
And snap like a pool stick against cement
If you suck of dick, pretend it’s a musical instrument
You get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
I can tell at first glance you’re a ho
Cause your pants are so tight
When you dance with O. Trice, your implants explode
So cold to dykes, the chance is snow in San Francisco
Boy I’m from Detroit city, you livin’ in animosity
That’s a fucked up state to be in, such an atrocity
Look where these random thoughts get me
In senseless mind babble, “What me? Apologize? labrbrr”
That’s just the way the rhyme unravels
And I wouldn’t fucking take it back if I time traveled!

Just call me Richard, cause I’m a dick
It’s also Richard cause I feel like you should
Pry your fucking mouth up off of it
I said just call me Richard, cause I’m a dick
You ain’t gotta be no detective to figure out I’m a dick
When I hold my privates to your first clue
Sherlock, prick! Just call me Richard

That’s my motives, jumpin’ out them Rovers
All white, like I was right up in the Dakotas
Or Minnesota, did I mention soda?
When it’s mixed with viola, watch my cup runneth over
Cut from a soldier
Them ho niggas disposable toaster
Putting holes in a nigga getting close enough
Being me till the credits roll
Till my condition is beyond what the medics know
They wanna edit O
Like a prosthetic third leg let it go
This is Shady 1.0 Em let ‘em know
I still profit through the process
The prize in my jeans my balls’ll never digress
I’m a dick that I brag about
I put it in fast and then I drag it out
World, I be your special friend see
Cause these suckas suffer from pseudo penis envy

Just call me Richard, cause I’m a dick
It’s also Richard cause I feel like you should
Pry your fucking mouth up off of it
I said just call me Richard, cause I’m a dick
You ain’t gotta be no detective to figure out I’m a dick

What would I sing
To say what I'm saying?
And would you believe
The verses left open?
The heart on my sleeve

And how do you do the things you do to you?

Sell me a river
And I'll skate away
To the downstream
Where I did play
So easy minded
Like a hill on the skyline
Tripped up and blinded
Getting lost on the sidelines

And how do you do the things you do to you?

And the pyre we plan to make is just the drift leaving its wake, ah

And the kids, like lost angels dressed in black sensations
And the shift won't shake and the drift won't brake
With billions of diamonds growing like olives and the drift holds the coffers

Like the things you found in love are by the way 
And like to cheat on your soul 
Like the best and worst of thoughts that lose control 
Before you lie on your bed

It's more or less the same as the things that you said 
Anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow 
Anyway for all the things you said tell me why does the river run red 
Anyway for all the things you've seen tell me when will the river run green 
And anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow

It's more or less the things you fail to say in your way that's your trouble 
Like a King who stalks the wings and shoots the moon and the stars 
And his double 
It's more or less the same as the things that you said 
I see trouble up ahead 
Where the river boat swayed beneath the sun 
Is where the river runs red 
I see double - that's my trouble",The Riverboat Song [DVD]

Ocean Colour Scene,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Riverboat Song (BBC Session Simon Mayo 9/6/97)

Playing hide and seek

She loved to play with fire

He was older than her
Then he made her do things
First she wouldn't dare
She left everything behind
Couldn't find a place
Running through the night
Loosing all her faith
She throws away the pain
Turning off her lies
But still he makes her see

Oceanlab,"Across the Eerie waters
Misty covered glass I spied
A sad procession, snaking down
The dry and deathly trail
And as my telescopic eye
Focused on the marching line
It settled on the fallen crown
Now covered with a veil

The heavy weight of mourning
Drew each head to face the ground
Muscles tight on bearers' arms
Each body cold and frail
And through the muslin mist
The beating drums, the only sound
Twenty boats out in the bay
All ready to set sail

Ashes take me back to Earth
Water quench my human thirst
Ashes take me back to Earth
Water quench my human thirst

My bones soaked in the icy cold
And fixed me where I lay
Until each vessel left the shore
And made a line for me
There never was a breeze
The leaves were silent all that day
They say the sails were ghosts
That stole the wind to set them free

I layed transfixed
Felt nothing, but the beating of my fear
As flames rose up and swallowed whole
Greatest of the fleet
The others circled round
And I heard chanting fill the air
The ashes, lifted high
Were falling back into the sea

Ashes take me back to Earth
Water quench my human thirst
Ashes take me back to Earth
Water quench my human thirst",Ashes

And the walls fall down around my heart

I was kissing clocks, you knew I would

I was grabbing tight but lost a hold
Now who'd wanna stay?
While we're all here changing

I was ripped apart but held by glue
I was full of lies but spoke the truth
Now I've lost myself
Oh I forgot how this felt

Octobop,"Why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to nine
Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Jeru

To your wanderlust,
In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
Just you wait.......!

In a mountain greenery,
Where god paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together.

While you love your lover,
Let blue skies, be your cover-let,
When it rains we'll laugh at the weather.

And if you're good,
I'll search for wood,
So you can cook... while i stand look-in'

Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery

You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow

I see shit fuckin' seasick, rain showers is what I predict
My flow is like gymnastics, so
Beef flips, patty cakes, smoke a pound of dro for the algae taste
Say what up to my pinky, say hi to my index
Fuck all the hoes want middle finger, thumb take shots like a pentax
Bitch I kill 'em all, you could just write off they're death tax
Boxin' niggas out of the mic, punch lines, death match

I invented swag, fuck what these other niggas talkin' 'bout
Niggas wanna brag 'bout the shit that they lack
But the truth of the fact, it's all word of mouth
Talk a lot of crap, but ain't shit for sure
Bathin' Ape shit that I get for low
I don't pay much and I don't say much
But I still got a swag you should get to know
I flip a show, spend it on apparel
Spanish bitch tell me I look mucho dinero
Then she say she love me and I tell her I don't care ho
I'm in the fast lane with my foot on the pedal
Smash, I'm takin' off
Lot of niggas hate, but I shake 'em off
Put that hash in a bong, it'll make ya cough
And the purp's goin' down like the Lakers lost
Cause we them niggas, yea
Doper than the 80's, baby
Careful, I might snatch your bitch and turn her to a wavy lady
Scare 'em when I'm taking steps
Sorry bitch, I'm paper, chase
When I get where I am, I want my demands
With my nuts in my hand, like fuckin' bait

Yeah! Balls in my hand!
Monster cock! Odd Future Wolf Gang
Kill them all! Yea",Lean
Odd Future,"Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album
You feel me, son? Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyon, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude, shouts out to L-Boy Awk

Big eared bandit is tossing all his manners
In a bag and wrapping them in seran wrap bandages
Tossing 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says ""Catch up, nigga"" it looks like an accident
Um, flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
It's the dark skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic contradicting dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semen scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang)

To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowing you own your opponent is a defeating bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers
Dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went jousting
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbin' in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels, and your pet, I'm stealing your rings
Coke diamonds and your Vet, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop when you shoot you gon' poop
It's kill Hodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool aid, Juice

Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga I'm tryin' to smoke, bitch get higher
Domo where that Flocka Flame? Talkin' 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
Livin' like the Mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters actin' up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave you flossin' and cause exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealin' home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreamin' of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hangin' the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catchin' matinees, huh?
I'm gettin' blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say ""get 'em Mike G"" then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga I'm a problem
From Briggs I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Prolly not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glock
Now I'm all grown, sing songs just to give 'em watts
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than the otter pop
Op Dom neck shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff out of this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin' area
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carey up
And fuck your team, ho nigga wassup
Wolf Gang so you know we not givin' no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut so I can
Cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga

Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga what can I say
I'm hi and I'm bye, wait I mean I'm straight
I'mma give you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fuckin' crystal balls can I buy and own
Humble old me had to flex for the fogs
Down in Muscle Beach pumpin' iron and bone
Bumpin' oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumpin' oldies off my cellular phone

Goddammit, this rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here I go

Hey it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pot head, half baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat

Hah, nigga came through with a 9 bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang

Yeah, fuck that, look, the contrast is a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin, settin' fires to sheriffs whips
(Whoosp, whoosp) fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit to the lips meet the bottom of a barrel
So that sterile piss flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin' ill apparel, wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And 60 day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko, and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole was numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup, or Nevada
Drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck, shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
I'm roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as the porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass, scorchin' ladies
Motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me with savages, have a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me you can't like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Back like lateral passin'
With that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict I let percocets and xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

OF, shit that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Naks
Shredding down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape, and my shoes
Um, I was 15 when I first drew that donut
5 years later, for our label yea we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fuckin' beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggas in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the n-word
And the ones that got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats, and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fuckin' amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitching, being mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck
Bitches

OFM, bangin' on your FM
Gnaw, 2011, yeah, Golf Wang",Oldie
Odd Future,"Okay, welcome to my 12 bar
The beat, wears it like a kevlar
As I smoke my tree, medlar, South African
Coughing 'til there's pains in my fucking abdomen
I spit negative just like a halogen
My breeze more of a fucking masculine
The rascals win, killing them all with a javelin
Snakes, I'm just rattling, suit taylor never taddling
You niggas a bunch of squares, Madison
As far as real niggas, bitch nigga my battle's sick
On top of being talented, bitch I'm fucking passionate
I'm a golden curse, call me treacherous, treasure chest
Better yet, I'll build on to the beat like Tetris
Remember me, forgetfulness, I am your correctionist
I stitched odd and future together like a leather vest
You fucking sweater neck, feather peck, Rosetta checks
I put together decks and push for beef, If head for less
I'm headed out to Sydney Australia with Tim Donnelly
He gets caught up at security, the TSA don't follow me
Tea parties are the shit, forty mags by the scones
I'm fighting for gun rights to shoot a nigga in his dome
Click your fucking heels, there's no place like home
Cock back and blast off written on the tombstone, ain't that a bitch

Let's see, what's wrong with me might be my fucking tourett see
I need a vacation cause all this shit got me stressing
So after the showers with Sandusky,
me and Sean Kingston went and rented a couple jet skis
Lionel rolled the blunts up, so meanwhile me and Lucas getting fucked up
You can smell us coming like a faggot when he hicks up
Listening to Common's last album to get pumped up
So finally asked [scratch] when I can get my dick sucked
You know Casey Anthony, was handling
Dropping her kids off so she could come out and dance with me
Wine in the pantry, wrestling on my trampoline
Learned some new chords while you uncreative were sampling
I'm wolf, I spit flow-y partly
As retarded as the sound of deaf people arguing
You hold the future of the kid you daughter's gargling
Me, I have the odd future motherfucking sargeaning
(Tyler calm the fuck down) No, I'm the fuck now
My poppa didn't give one, that's why I'm like this now
I'm still down to cut throat
And if another fan asks for a photo while I'm snacking on my pizza lunchable
I'm 'a fucking snap like Berman when he acts right
Then have a mental breakdown and proceed to use a crack pipe
OF will be done for, niggas will be dumb poor
Don't believe me, OK be right back, I'm headed to the gun store
M-16's and them 16's came out of nowhere like your kid's wet dream
What you mean old news, oh you
Will you need us to fucking show you that we're harder than finding a fucking snickers bar in whole foods
In a black hoodie, nose bruised and a gold tooth
Hoping the security guard doesn't hold you in custody
But luckily had a couple of guns with me
Like gay step mom, none of you motherfuckers can fuck with me",P
Odd Future,"I'm tired of these hoes (hoes)
I need a real bitch
To handle all the things
That I don't wanna deal with, oh
I said I need a real bitch
She buys her own accessories, and her heels sick

She really want me a lot, but she kills dick
Now that's a real bitch, and I'm a real nigga
And we the realest
Fuck real estate, we in the realest state
Counting paper bills behind the bill of gates
Peak out my Left Eye, look at her Chilli face
Could this be TLC, or is it really hate
I need a real bitch
Where my bitches at?

Where my bitches at?  Where my bitches at?

Some real bitch shit, where my real bitches at?

Who can make french toast and suck dick
She's 5'6"" with firm tits
Went to UCLA until she met my dick
You wanted to be a doctor? I bet you did
But if was a fifth then you wouldn't be my bitch
Making steak and bacon, that's your job, you stupid trick
Your daddy's rich, indeed, now please hit your knees
My dick won't suck itself
If it wasn't for my cock, you would have bad health
You crave my junk
Kick-box lessons so you won't get preg'nont
I pull that bastard out myself, on some real nigga shit
I trap, you suck, and the world fucking spins
Swag swag  swag swag

Riding with my bitch and you know she hella chil
Coachella, front row, baby girl pop a pill
Show me how you feel, bitch keep it real swag

Um, a real bitch, let me see

You know what I'm saying, she handle her own business

And a real bitch gotta know how to roll my weed up",Real Bitch

This is my electronic press kit, hot as some fresh shit
Nigga recollect bitch, grow grey hairs, don't stress it
I text message, messages to fuckin' estrogen
She lets me in, I sex her then she sexier than my leather vans
Cause I never am purchasing, reimbursing your currency
Put your body on the curb to work the street, I hearse the streets
Heard she sweet, she Hershey's sweet but me I'm extravagant
Hop on the bandwagon kid, I'm about to tell you some tragic shit
The love is lost and the drugs they cost, in the studio mixing raw
Bitchs shit in my draws like you piss in my draws, nigga my dick's in her jaw

Please let me flex, I'm going off I need some fuckin' bread
Drugs are green, my bitches white and tonight I need fuckin' head
Excuse the swag, I'm tryna tone it down like Jenny Craig
Fresh to death then I guess we looking like the living dead
Oh shit, yo bitch, look at how I'm doing you
Bitches on my dick but look at me I'm fucking beautiful
Niggas tryna figure out, but all I hear in my interviews
Is why this so cool? You niggas are so unusual
Wolf Gang, point me to a nigga I should prove it to
Under pressure, we just stand in the middle like hula hoops

The fortress is fortified (bitch)
Money in my pockets like I'm 45, Hodgy Beats recording live
Bitch I be surely high and I don't need wings to fly
I'm in the air with the pigs, Left Brain, Domo Genesis

Knock-knock, who's there?

Let's get it poppin' like, MC Lyte, around some dykes
I'm, out this bitch like hocus pocus
And me and Lucas got a couple of pickles
And met up with bitches, gave 'em cum on their dimples
Then my dick went limp so, took about 3 pills of Extenzo
Now my dick's longer than a 5 door limo
Harder than a soft right hook from kimbo on PCP and cilantro
When I'm with your bitch I'm like, ""Where my dick go?""
Now she think I'm 'bout to eat her hole

When I look out my window there's trees talking like people
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity, keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and there was silence
What is this love? I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is, could be given a name
I woke, you were there, tracing planets on my forehead

Hey muthafuckas, guess what I got
I just came from the spot and I scooped up a pot
Of this good coughee, I got it right up under my hat
It's in a brown paper sack, it's a dime and it's fat
Pass me a swisher so I can twist a
Nice fat muthafuckin spliff for ya, mister
Shit, cause I'm ready to get wired up
First I lick the leaf and I tie it up
Get the lighter and fire it up
But bitch, when you get it don't be tryin to hit it hard
So you cough and you joke and you slob and you fart
Fuckin round with my coughee, bitch, you better be cautious
Cause hoe, you know I roll big old horse dicks
To keep you blowed higher than giraffe nut
I spend my last ten even if I need a half cut
My girlfriend trippin out she don't understand why
I come in fucked up every night and I

Drink about two or three coughees in the mornin
(Bitch get off it, I gotta have coughee)
I get high so I try to keep a whole pile on it
(I gotta have coughee)
So if you know where to get a fat dime, bitch, I want it
(Bitch get off it, I gotta have coughee)
Just go and get the weed, hoe, I got five on it
(I gotta have coughee)

[ Devin ]
A nice good cup of coughee, somethin for your head
I keep a sack on my back just like ( ? )
At your door in the morning, hoe, get up, roll a square
I got some weed that's guaranteed to make your eyeballs bleed
Not a dime this time but a nice fat quarter
We call our shit coughee but we don't dip it in that water
Just straight weed, muthafuckas, no sugar no cream
Save all that shit for all them old school dopefiends
This dedicated to my fellow coughee drinkers
Like Corey, Dexter, Keith and Crhis, I like to thank y'all
For comin by the crib when I'm broke to get a nigga full
(Smokin that weed) and drinkin Schlitz Malt Liquor Bull
Cause when I rap, that's all I need
And a friend with weed, now that's a friend indeed
Yo and since I'm unemployed and every day is my off-day
I kick off my shoes and I booze and I choose to drink coughee

I know your breath get stank (a-ha), your throat get dry (yeah)
But I like gettin high, bitch, I'm blowed right now
I got a brew in my hand, Lil' James can't understand
Why we stumblin through the studio drunk again
Drinkin coughee, eyes red, tight and shiny
When the laws get behind me, yo, my nuts don't get tiny
I just reach up under my seat and get my heat and get em off me
Cause they took my driver's license but them bitches can't have my

Sittin in the next room talkin softly on the telephone
Makin plans to see ya soon when I know I'm dead wrong
Why oh why must I continue to be a hoe
When I got a fine yellow bow-legged bitch at the crizzo?
She know jizza, guess I was only out to get paid
This girl was cuttin for daddy like a Mexican with a switchblade
But anyway, peek it, loc, here's how the story went
Second week in July, I think ehm, Tuesday the 10th
Around 4 p.m. with this bitch named Kim
She wasn't all that in the face but she had her own place
I got caught up in temptation, now here's what I'm facin
The situation's thick, I'm steadily thinkin with my dick
And I'm constantly askin myself, like, should I rush this hoe?
But you know - damn, little did I know
She was my best friend's sister's cousin auntie mother niece
Up on my daddy's side, I couldn't even lie
My girl start buggin, illin, riffin, trippin, she gave my face a smack
Now she's got a busted lip and says I overreacted
Now it's her things that she's packin
Hey yo baby, apologize, but now I realize, hm, I knew exactly how she felt
That's why I'm sittin at the crib by my goddamn self
The reason why, because I had to trick
Now I'm breakin my back tryin to suck my own dick

[ CHORUS (2X): Devin ]
When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy

[ VERSE 2: Jugg Mugg ]
Okay now check it, I met this gal, she got it goin on
Everytime I see this bitch she's all up on a nigga's bone
I told the bitch I had a woman and a little girl
She's diggin in my pants, grabbin my nuts like a fuckin squirrel
So what was I to do, me and my woman had trust
But I was thinkin how many nuts I can bust
In this hoe, I hit the pussy fast, hit the pussy slow
She whipped out her tongue and licked the Jugg up his asshole
She couldn't call the crib when she wanted some cock
So she would beep and I would sneak, we would meet at the bus stop
And then I called her to my crib one day
Because my daughter was at the daycare and my gal was at the jay
We gots to hurry up and bone, my girl get home at 5:30
She knew somethin was funny, so she came home early
And all that moanin and groanin, I couldn't listen
She busted in and caught me in a 69 position

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Devin ]
Me and my gal, we been apart for a while
Yeah, I miss her kiss and I kinda miss her smile
But I'm the one who fucked up walkin round with a big head
She made me feel like I had a gold-plated dick head
But I was tryin to fuck everything that moved and breathed
She never checked or suspected there was somethin up a nigga sleeve
Yeah, my baby she trusted me, she never even cussed at me
Except that Friday night when she busted me
I found a letter on the dresser that said:
'Tell your bitches don't be leavin they panties in my bed'
And I was laughin and shit when she left at first
But in a couple of weeks that shit started to hurt
Now it's been six months and when she call all she do is talk cold to me

I’m not rich I’m just on the way back to the land where they need this grip
You give yours to a charity fund, I give mine to a cuz that’s sick
You see your name and it fourth on the list, scared I’m involved in the causing of pain
Lost somebody you loved in the towers and looking at me like I boarded the plane
I’m just an artist you’re not a target no use in arguing we all look the same
With that knowledge I stay calm when they search for bombs all they find is green
All in the name - I got a name that’ll scare all the brave in the land of the free
All in the name of protecting a country that’s shooting its citizens dead in the streets
I used to live in Northeast D.C. not too far from Capitol Hill
White House here, trap house there, they were so near you could go by feet
Never mind that cause that’s not news - let’s stay glued to the war on peace
Who gets blamed? Whoever can sway that election towards what the order seeks
We just want to keep oil cheap, we just want to keep motors full

I met a boy who arrived in the rain, he lost his folks when they torched his home
That made me want to bring my fam before they see that side of a drone
But who wants us, we build your world it’s “labor’s cool, neighbors no”
I got a cuz that’ll drive your taxi, I got a cuz that’ll make your food
I got a cuz that’ll watch your kids and pick them up when they’re done with school
I got a cuz that’ll pump your gas, I got a cuz that’s good with tools
I got a cuz that’ll be your doctor after a test that I hope he’ll pass
Isn’t that what you fear most? But fear don’t trump your needs
Our pros do trump our cons though. And cons don’t trump your greed
And monsters’ what you make of us and we make you succeed
And that’s what makes this country great, it’s built by those who bleed
It’s built by those who came on boats, it’s built by those who flee
And you forgot your family tree and we’re just all your leaves
So if you just try to chop us down you only hurt your knees
And we could go in pieces but we’d rather come in peace

'Scuse me for being rude, know it sounds so crass
But political correctness ain't my program
I'm P.G., I was raised 'round a high-low class
Young, got me feeling like a dinosaur
I'm coming from an era where we knew each other's business
But like diamonds in the ore we just mined it more
They say that real becoming harder to find
Good news, mean a lot of you is probably dying
Or moving out the city cause of all the property buying
Let alone cover rent for the crib each month
So you can move to L.A. Where you can still cheap stunt
Can I get a witness?
Black entrepreneur here, can I get some business?
Taking out a loan, not asking for-givness
Just take away the stone, hard place wasn't lifting
Cause it landed on me, I ain't land on it
Grandma never cussed like daggone it
Frustrated free, I'm picking locks
Cause time still sitting in a box

I ain't got no plans, trying to keep it that way
I'm just trying to do what I want to do
Every hour, minute, second of the day
I never make reservations, I don't hold none neither
What I bring to the table is the truth
So I know I'm always right this way
I ain't got no plans, trying to keep it that way
I'm just trying to do what I want to do
Every hour, minute, second of the day
I never make reservations, I don't hold none neither
What I bring to the table is the truth
So I know I'm always right this way

And I've been up late, thinking I should move upstate
Get a farm in the middle of a town called Nowhere sounding like enough space
But I like culture so near it grabs me
Agriculture I'd do it gladly
I think the answer is a loft in the middle of the city and the roof where the plants be
Let's grow, hustle real hard knowing nothing come easy
Party on the boulevard well let's go
I'ma take a rain check knowing any minute that 
The warm front ending and we all get snow
I ain't make the laws but I am trying to break them
And not get caught by the criminals that make them
Funny that the boss gets a pardon and the 
Sargent get absolved when the evidence blatant
A'salaam alaikum I'm just trying to get a peace 
From the patience of a saint in the belly of the beast
And the lowest in the rank think the hardest in the tank
But we seldom get the credit so we never get the lease
Sleeping on the streets be the same ones paving
Walking on slaughter and the water ain't free
Floating with the attitude of y'all ain't me
And I had it just as bad as you and now I made it
Well that's great then, though
Your triumph ain't erasing what I'm facing, so
Get up out my face with the conversations bout how you can relate then no
I'm the trenches, I'm riding on the train
Local shop owners here, I probably know their names
Surviving on the streets doing something like me
What you doing, man, nothing this week

I ain't got no plans, trying to keep it that way
I'm just trying to do what I want to do
Every hour, minute, second of the day
I never make reservations, I don't hold none neither

I don't make easy to follow
Cause when I'm easy they come come round and they come see me to borrow
They don't give props up, they pot holes
So around them how I go
Had that happen a few times for me to view signs
Now quickly I know
Now quickly I know
Yeah this King Odd
Writer of the rhythm with the pristine bars
Keep it hard for me to ever see a loss
I'm only getting better while the rest peel off
This solid, not plated
Barter at the market that you'll never get away with
Your loss
I'm the favorite of your favorite

Oddisee,"Been on the road for quite some time now
En route to work is the only time that I wind down
I feel like Caesar on a quest to make Rome bigger
I played in trees as a child and could never climb down
Becoming introspective, I need to be more selective
I'm way too nice got me feeling bad to ignore a message
I traded secrets with homies I really thought could keep it
The Minute I leave and they steal my dreams and they try to sell it
I can't tell if it's, my fault or theirs
People being themselves I need to be more prepared
I guess it's time to tighten up the circle
Put some notches in the belt for all the weight I've had to shed
More locks up on the door, a couple cameras in the front
Yeah I know who you are but what do you want?
Fool what you want?
Fool what you want?
(I'm sorry scratch it like that)
Fool what you want?

I've been contemplating drinking and the use of drugs
My favorite artists do it, they all influence us
I ain't talking Future but rather older names
I'm talking Hendrix, talking Davis, talking Marvin Gaye
They were kings but to the coping they became a slave
Know that I got it in me don't pass me a shot of whiskey
Anything I do, I do it the most
It just so happens I'm rewarded for being extreme
Applauded workaholic falling asleep in the office
And I'll never get fired
Irony, I'm a boss cause I could never get hired
Ain't got an off switch, therefore my bills higher
Somebody get coffee, black, single origin like our ancestors

I'm not interested in coming to your studio or chilling after shows
I've got to do this all over tomorrow
I'd rather chill in my home, go out to eat just me and Ziz in the park
Seldom see me in the streets after dark
Cept' my name in that mar- quee
Traded street lights for stage lights
I'm trying to make a living from art
Have a life full of love, memories you can not like or remark
I'm only posting what I'm seeing in parts
I mean what's more tragic, living in a hyper reality
Or the the systematic murder of magic
I'm chasing the wild things and they're becoming harder to find
In time I'm sure they'll only live in my mind
But for now I'm on the prowl for the how's
Leave it all up to chance bruh

Oddisee,"I fell asleep with open eyes again
Seeing me how others see me on my mind again
I hope I don't find offense
With people's versions of what I present
I'm not worried but kinda am
I'm slowly learning, most people get me but the side effects
Small percentage of those repelled by all that I project
But that's just life I guess
Can't win em all but I just like the bet
I'm rolling the dice again
I roll to functions full of punks and wish that they feelin' me 
They clutch their fist reluctantly humbly as to build with me
Discussions over lunches on how they once can appeal to me
Tip another twenty and money don't fit the bill to me
I watch how people move, yeah they work strong
But then physically they vision weak
Smaller print of their truth just appeared to me
But that ain’t how I move, I just show and prove
Promotions fill with power man that’s power I won’t lose

I think I found my weakness, I think I found my strength
And all I love and hate, they're one in the same
Now how am I gon' use it, try not to abuse it

What would you do if you knew you could get away with
Anything you wanted to as long as people wanted something from you?
Would you make em wait, knowing you could make all of their dreams true in a day
Go and hesitate and let em salivate until they give up and they subdue
Just to demonstrate how long it take until a person break
Power trippin' easy nowadays, nowadays all the
Culture vultures look to bottom feeders for their power plays
Bucket crowded and the crabs fighting
Puppets pick the people on their last legs
Desperate dreamers turn to dirty fiends
Hurting me to see the crowd beg in their loudest moment
Seem too clear to be clouded by those who got it golden
Brass status green could go brown at any sporadic moment
So I stay open, reply to calls, fly or fall, all in all

je loupe les rendez-vous ! Je reste sans carrosse à côté de mon grand ego. 
Coûte que coûte, je compte les heures au goutte à goutte, 
j'écoute mes doutes, mais c'est la mort au bout de l'égout. 
C'est du pareil au même : j'en ai rien à foutre ! 
Je glisse et je pisse sur le bord de ma route. 
Je rentre dans ma feuille en attendant que je la cueille. 
Dépenser mon temps à des pensées d'enfant. 
Je rappe des fois sans, quitte à dépasser l'attente,
je reste à deux pour cent dans mon conte de fées lattant. 
Avec qui je dois danser ? Je reste sur un ring. 
J'aurais dû recommencer ? Comme un fou ? Comme un dingue ? 
Pfffff !!! Se ranger, à s'en ronger les ongles, 
chez moi, se ranger revient à creuser sa tombe. 
Je rêve d'une petite qui soufflerait dans mes veines, 
je suis dépendant d'une sale drogue mondaine. 
Cracher mes conseils sur des passant raisonnables, 
j'embrasse des comptines dans le cou un peu partout... 
Beaucoup trop flou ! Pas debout du tout ! 
Trop de tout ! Trop fou ! 
Pas du goût de tous ! Tant pis ! Y me trompent tous ! 
Parlez-moi de vous ! 
Je cherche un con de coin, épargnez-moi la foule...

Aujourd’hui tout va bien, je te remercie Dieu merci, 
et même si des fois me scie le moral d’être ici. 
Loin de toi, sous un toit, autre fois autre chose. 
Il fait chaud, glace à l’eau 2 euros 20 centimes, 
le Jardin, Luxembourg voir ceux qui jouent aux échecs, 
les amoureux bien fous et le joueur de tambour. 
Le cuicui des oiseaux il ne sonne pas si niais, 
il détend le résigné et son cône résineux. 
Aujourd’hui tout va bien je me suis organisé, 
j’ai rempli mes deux mains de trucs pour pas m’ennuyer. 
Loin de toi, sous le ciel, un autre ciel autre chose. 
Il fait froid, boisson chaude 2 euros 20 centimes, 
la terrasse pour fumer, chocolat et blouson, 
une écharpe, des souvenirs, ton sourire, tes colères. 
Le vroom vroom des voitures et leurs pots d’échappement rendent amer le cacao et mon marc de café. 
Aujourd’hui tout va bien je me sens si léger ! 
Je suis beau, je suis fort prêt à manger du danger. 
Loin de toi, toi t’es loin comme les îles Canaries, 
le Brésil ça n’arrive que si t’y vas et que tu veux. 
Moi je suis là loin des lianes, à mille lieues pour narguer ta saveur je crève les yeux de ton cœur amoureux. Aujourd’hui tout va bien et demain sera pareil, 
j’ai vraiment pas besoin de ta sale salsepareille, 
sale parole, parano, 2 euros 20 centimes. 
Des angoisses, jours pluvieux, t’es sanguine... 
Wesh cousine.

On se lasse des mots doux, 
de bouches à oreilles on se laisse des maux troubles. 
Je constate des doutes dans les évidences, 
on se moque de tout tant que les heureux dansent 
donc je rappe du vaudou et laisse le gras du mot double.

Ça dégouline sur ta belle gueule quand je dégueule ma belle, 
tu bats de l'aile seule.",Maux Doux
Odezenne,"Je m'équipais d'armure dorée, 
d'une belle épée, d'amour donné. 
Tu répondais d'un mur douillet, 
d'un bel été, d'une mort noyée.

Je t'ai passé des « songs », t'as tapé le gong, 
j'ai fait ton King Kong et rentré dans ta ronde. 
La plage, les tongs, des sacs et des bombes. 
Je désapais des thons et t’as passé l'éponge. 
Claquer des cons, casser tes ongles, 
attendre des plombes, passer dans l'ombre...
T'attendais le bon, t'as pété les plombs, 
au coin de ma tombe je fais des bonbons. 
J'éclate des gonzes, je chie sur le bronze, 
ma belle colombe où sont tes talons ? 
Tes miettes de seins, ça pique et ça nique. 
J'arrête demain, ma belle électrique.

Je l'ai prise par la main, méli-mélo. 
Je l'ai mise dans mon bain, déli-délo. 
Je l'ai prise par les seins, délit mélo. 
Je l'ai mise dans mon bain, mets-là dans l'eau.

Bla bla bla bla...

En sac à main une sale gamine, 
du rouge carmin au bout des doigts, 
te brise les ailes d'un battement de cils. 
Elle si belle soudaine sans remord, 
amène ton coeur sanglant elle le mord, 
te donne son corps, t'en rends accro... 
te tire trois balles, poum poum poum dans le dos.
Et sur le trottoir y’a des cœurs qui saignent, 
des cerveaux dans le noir, des yeux qu'ont pris des beignes, 
des histoires d'amour au tournant fâché, 
où tous les discours ne sont que du temps gâché. 
Des contrefaçons d’amour en suçons, 
te laisse des sons, amère du sang. 
Sa bouche t’invite, son cul t’habite, 
évite vite la messe est dite.

Je l'ai prise par la main, méli-mélo.

Ça m'attriste, c'est marrant... Je médite ces infos : 
-« Meredith, dites, dites, trop petite, dites, dites ? » 
Elle grandit dans des cantines une clé autour du cou, 
pas de « Sonnez les matines », elle est grande un point c'est tout... 
Elle rêve, rêve, rêve d'une brève, trêve, trêve. 
Meredith la nympho se fait troncher par une foule, 
c'est marrant, c'est pas faux, se fait belle comme une poule...
-« Elle est belle, belle, belle, besoin d'elle, d'elles, d'ailes. »

Elle distribue des cœurs, ne regarde pas les corps. 
Elle dissimule les peurs peu importe le décor. 
-« Meredith, dites, dites, où t'habites, bite, bite ? » 
Une reine de nuit embellie par l'alcool, 
elle rêve de lui d'y poser son bémol... 
Donc elle danse, danse, danse en transe, danse, danse. 
Elle perle du front, une goutte sur chaque son, 
des mecs l'affronte des doutes entre les seins... 
Elle gueule, gueule, gueule : 
-« T'es pas seule, seule, seule ! » 
Elle rêve des champs, de l'herbe, du vent, 
elle vomit son métro et ses pots d'échappement. 
-« Meredith rentre vite ! Quand tu pites, pites, pites. » 
Un pied sur une chaise, de l'air sur le visage, 
un corps en terre glaise, elle regarde des images. 
-« Meredith, dites, dites tu nous quittes, quittes, quittes ? » 
Elle plonge du 5ème un sourire aux lèvres. 
Elle éponge au centième la vie et ses merveilles. 
-« Meredith, dite tu m'évites ? »
Je vois des fantômes, des toutous blancs, 
ils appuient l'hématome de ton cou tout blanc.

Odezenne,"Quand je me tranche et que je m'épanche au lacet. 
Quand elle se penche et que je prends ses hanches au lasso... 
C'est dans la vengeance qu'elle avance, 
c'est en patience qu'elle mène la danse. 
En cadence, j'y vais, j'y vais... 
En trame de fond une nuit longue, j'entame le fond avec ma nuit langue, 
j'entends des sons sur ces longues ondes. 
Plus de shit sous mes ongles, j'arrondis mes angles. 
L'amour se mute et s'évapore, c'est sa mort.
-« chuuttttt... » 
Et ses vapeurs. Elle a maquillé le crime au mascara ! 
Pas de trace d'homicide sous le masque ? 
- « Arrête !!! » 
On attend de la prendre la main dans le sac. 
Un flagrant délit après deux verres quand la langue se délie, 
après deux heures sous les draps d'un lit. 
Scène de crime absurde, celle d'un lit nocturne.

Voilà qu'il s'empiffre souffrant !
Voilà qu'il renifle tout blanc !
Il se souvient des oiseaux qui sifflent au printemps et prend le temps de fumer son spliff jusqu'au teint blanc. 
Dans les vapeurs de l'alcool, l'odeur d'un soutif hautain se dissimule... 
Mirage trompeur d'un passé trop plein. 
Quand il se voit, il se dit « ce nul ». 
J'ai passé trop de temps dans mon passé, 
trop de dents s'y sont cassées, 
c'était assez tentant de s'entasser,

Ils ont le charisme d’un chewing-gum Dopé au barbiturique
Alors j’compte ma pelouse Pour zigzaguer
Entre les rifs et les gimmicks Du saxo de mon blues
J’préfère les voyages Au dessus des nuages 
Bras d’ssus bras d’ssous Avec une petite coccinelle

Face à ma feuille blanche 
Tracer des sentiers d’encre 
Encre lâché près d’l’archipel vierge 
Nager jusqu’à la rive 
Berger d’mon troupeau d’mot 
Transhumance du flow 
Perdu au milieu de c’désert blanc 
Îlot glacé 
Ils l’ont souillé idiot 
Et là, m’voilà dans mon no man’s land hello 
Hélas 
Ici Pas de traces préexistantes 
Face à cette abstinence 
Je tente une direction sans pertinence 
Rebrousse chemin mais pas d’repères à l’horizon 
Repousse demain mais désespère alors qu’ils ont... 
...Epousé ma main 
A travers l’stylo que j’tiens 
Et tant pis si j’me perds : 
J’plante ma tante ici !! 
Respire un peu l’air, 
Juste pour tenter si 
Ma futur ville s’construit ici, tâter si 
La place pour l’verbe ainsi 
Palace de glace aussi 
Au service de ma poésie, une fois d’plus, juste une fois d’plus 
Ma feuille blanche se remplie...

A 4 contre 1, ma main maintient le stylo 
Ma bille roule sur les lignes de c’paysage vierge 
J’ai l’vertige des premiers mots placés très hauts 
Vivement la chute mais pour ça faut qu’je gamberge
J’me fais argonaute 
De c’panorama 
Octogone à la main 
Mes idées font du pogo
Y a plein de trucs dans ma tête J
’ai pas pied, y a pas de mer 
Mais je lâche quand même l’encre 
Au cœur de c’t’univers
Mine qui fait des loopings 
Forme consonnes et voyelles 
Assonances sans annonce 
Singulier et pluriel
Métaphores finement filées 
Trois branches de thème 
Que tu fais rev’nir 
Dans des p’tits carreaux perforés
Une pincée de syllabes

Dans une cage d’escalier 
Avec des vendeurs de poules

Odies Williams,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
