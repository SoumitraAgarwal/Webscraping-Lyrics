Alabama 3,"When I saw you in the garden of Gethsemane 
Drunk when you realized the plan
You fell into the arms of Mary Magdalene
The f stigmata on your hands
When the sky fell down on Calvary
I saw the light shining in your eyes
CHORUS
Cos you and mbaby we were born 10,000 years ago
I know it sounds crazy but we got 10,000 more to go

We followed behind the sisters to La Hegera
Saw Ramos kiss like Judus on the wire
When they cut his hair and laid him out like Jesus
I know October '67 John Lennon lied
Sgt Pepper could not help us
When the flowers died I realised

CHORUS
In 2129 IÕm gonna meet you in a cantina in Carleta
IÕm gonna put Bessie Smith on the jukebox all night long
When the Spanish sun comes up on our empty cups
Gonna take you dancing
stain of stigmata on your hands
When the sky fell down on Calvary
I saw the light shining in your eyes

CHORUS
Cos you and me gonna put Bessie Smith on the jukebox all night long
When the Spanish sun comes up on our empty cups
Gonna take you dancing deep down into the dawn
One bright morning when we meet St Peter
I aint gonna give a damn if he donÕt let us in

CHORUS",2129
Alabama 3,"Cocaine killed my community
Heroin hurt my home
Mama went down on the Morphine
Papa got high on the Physeptone
My sister swings on Psilocybin
My brother broke up her broke up on Barbituates
My two little cousins goon Barbituates
My two little cousins got shot selling rock
Outside the old school gates

CHORUS

I don't mind cos I live in the light
I live in the light of the Lord
The sword, the Lord he gave me
Is the sword thatttd, the Lord he gave me
Is the sword thats gonna save me
I live in the light of the Lord
'Cos
I need it every hour,
I need it every hour,
I need it every hour my gracious Lord",Cocaine (Killed My Community)
Alabama 3,"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself,
'This could be heaven or this could be hell'
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year, you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the captain,
'Please bring me my wine'
He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise, bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling,
The pink champagne on ice
And she said 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
And in the master's chambers,
They gathered for the feast
The stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
'Relax,' said the night man,
We are programmed to receive.
You can checkout any time you like,
But you can never leave!",Hotel California
Alabama 3,"Hit the dance round about midnight
Gin n juice and he's a feelin' fine
Come morning all the signs went up
Policeman said the joint was shut
All the brothers gettin' busted outside
Undercover officer readin' em their rights
One way ticket boy your prison bound
The night the lights in Dallas went down so

How long we gonna wait until
We get the keys to the mansion on the hill
I want to know right now
How long we gonna waste our time
Boarding a bus that's bound for the welfare line
I want to know right now

Shakes the blues off and she tries her luck
Makes a little bet hopes the horse comes up
Picks your pockets for some easy money
'Cause she blew the goddamn lot on the national lottery
Steals the paper and checks the front page
Headlines read the dancehall can't be saved
How can the open up the opera house
On the night the lights in Dallas went down

How long we gonna wait until
We get the keys to the mansion on the hill
I want to know right now
How long we gonna waste our time
Boarding a bus that's bound for the welfare line
I want to know right now

Tweak freak Tony on the 4 2 8
Special branch sting right time wrong place
Colombian connections in the corridors of power
Mean the man on the money ain't ever goin' down
Lord Lucky takes his lady to the magic flute
A little taste of heat and now he's bullet proof
Tony tunes to underground radio
On the night the lights in Dallas went down

How long we gonna wait until
We get the keys to the mansion on the hill
I want to know right now
How long we gonna waste our time
Boarding a bus that's boud for the welfare line
I want to know right now",Mansion on the Hill
Alabama 3,"She don't get up till the sun goes down
She don't come down till the sun comes up
She drinks her coffee from a broken cup
In her Jackie O sunglasses
She didn't get to bed till 10am

When the whiskey ran out
She had enough of her friends
Fussin' and fighting she reminded them
She hadn't slept for 100 hours

Sad-eyed lady of the lowlife come on
And burn with me
Put the high life on the bonfire baby
Lets go steal some gasogasooline

She got hot in the heat on that cemetery wall
When the preacher tried to kiss her
She new the light would burn bright again
She'd seen the angels in the disco
Ain't nobody gonna tell her when the bells a-gonna ring
And the fight's gonna end
Shee She'll be swinging when the whole world ends
Looking for another tomorrow",Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlife
Alabama 3,"We ain't seen land for 13 months
The water's running dry
The Captains drunk, stoned in his bunk
I seen the bosun gettin' the rum
that came from a bottle now long gone
St Christopher

The Albatross flew across the bow
Below ding high
My mouth so dry from the rum
That came from a bottle now long gone
St Christopher if you hear this now
Give us hope to carry on

The albatross flew across the bow
Below deck the captain roared
Bring me my gun
I want Opium
Stoned he shot the bird
When the wind died down the only sound
Was the whisper of his dying words
Beware don't stare at the Marie Celeste
This quest of ours is cursed

The full moon light burned bright as fire
As fever gripped the crew
To the east Ahab's screams
Split the wof ours is cursed

The full moon light burned bright as fire
As fever gripped the crew
To the east Ahab's screams
Split the winding sheet in two
To the west six silouettes
Hung sailors now long gone
We prayed that night that in the morning light
We'd all be blown to kingdom come

Just as we started sinking
The harbour lights came on
Arms of angels carried us
From the rocks we brokblown to kingdom come

Just as we started sinking
The harbour lights came on
Arms of angels carried us
From the rock we broke upon
As we swam into the still waters
The band began to play
I heard again that sweet refrain
Lord 0 happy day

Its gotta be alright",Sinking
Alabama 3,"Don't know if i miss you
Do you miss the part of me that used to feel?
Maybe if i kissed you
You'd miss the part of you that used to need me
Maybe if i held you
Took some time to tell you
The only time i hold you now is in my dreams
Schemes we shared together
Sweet sunsets, rocking chairs,
Are looking just as faded as my jeans

All the thrill are gone
What used to kill the pain no longer passifies you
What satisfied me once
Got me jumping the find of fire
Has left me burning on the wire
All the thrills are gone

(There's something missing. it takes quite a while to Realise, the whole world is changing.)

Sometimes when i'm walking
I walk the way you and i would walk
Sometimes when i'm drinking
I think about the things we used to talk about
A lovers lane(?) is to love
Every telephone is broken
I can't carry my words home to where i want to be
Some candlelit location
Singing on the radio station
Dreams slipping like an anchor to the sea

All the thrills are gone
What used to kill the pain no longer passifies you
What satisfied me once
Got me jumping the ring of fire
Has left me burned out on the wire
All the thrills are gone.",The Thrills Have Gone
Alabama 3,"(If I were ever to die, not likely say I, because I am gonna go on and on, just like the sun that you see come up every dawn, I'm there, eternal. You know, the power I have is the power to unleash love in every sphere. I can make ladies rise from the dead, no fear, watch how I do it, listen up here. A drop if mah seed to the east, to the west, to the north and the south and then I bring 'em up slow and they start shouting out loud and I make love till the cock crows and then, baby, don't you know, you're going back in the hole again 'til I bring you up once again to fill mah loving-cup)

I found darkness in the heart of the sunshine.
I got blinded by the light in the moon.
A black dog was barking at my back door 
When I began my life born alone.
And now my home is just a headache, just a heartache. 
Ain't no comfort in my family's arms.
Numb now, I know I'm urgin' to go under. 
There ain't no need to set the clock to alarm.

I like walking in my sleep 
But it's a nightmare on the 13th floor 
I've been wading in too deep
They found some bloodstains on the basement door 

I went looking for some peace in the country 
I found violence on the village green. 
The trees I climbed are tapped now and wired 
With undercover closed circuit TV;
Things fall apart; my centre is not holding; 
I crawl the city streets like a blindman.
The beast has just departed Bethlehem;
The Second Coming is getting out of hand.",Walking in My Sleep
Alabama 3,"I want to go deep down yeh
I want to go deep down yeh
â??Cause I remember

Met down by the river, the blue moon on the rise
I broke down like Brando moved by your Marilyn Monroe eyes
We were swimmin' in silver, we were searchin' for gold
And we promised that night that we would never grow old

And you sang to me
Wade into the water with me, wash my body down
Take me to the bottom baby, I won't make a sound
Baptise me like a child, let salvation start
â??Cause if you take me to the bottom of the river baby
I'll take you to the bottom of my heart

We got brighter than heaven, Lord yeah, we shone like the stars
I got as drunk as Bogart, you were just smokin' like Bacall
We were diggin' for diamonds, we were divin' for pearls
Higher up than the satellites and out of this world

And you sang to me
Wade into the water with me, wash my body down
Take me to the bottom baby, 'cause I won't make a sound
Baptise me like a child, gotta let salvation start
â??Cause if you take me to the bottom of the river baby
I'll take you to the bottom of my heart

Now the river is frozen, the blue moon is down
My drink has run dry, Lord ya cigarettes gone out
All the diamonds and the pearls, yeah all the silver and the gold
They were all turned to dust, yeah it's so cold

Mc shermos, alabama three ooh

I'm so sick and tired of feelin' sick and tired
I've been wired every night of this week
My troubled mind just cant find no comfort in sleep
I'm on th'wrong side of town I cant come down
I got holes in my dancin shoes
Look like a dog house flower
In the midnight hour
In the corner of some bar room

Give me one more minute of danger
Some bad medicine
I'll waste it on an hour in hell tonite
To get to heaven on adrenaline
Feel the rush

So down at here
Streetlight feels like some narcotic (that's right)
I stumble alone
Lookin' for home
An' no door key in my pocket
So I double back
I retrace my tracks to the place where all of this started
My getaway car was stole an you laugh
'Cause I forgot to lock it

Give me one more minute of danger
Some bad medicine
I'll waste it on an hour in hell tonite
To get to heaven on adrenaline
Feel the rush

I'm gonna take it any way that I can make it 
Run off adrenaline 
In my life I had to fake it
Needin' the medicine for everythin'
Dozens of hopes where you dont try to explain all it
Too many brothers skimmin'
I gets the feelin that my deals ain't no way to run
Somebody slip me by the loo having too much fun
Now I'm probably flippin', spendin', chillin', killin' too much time
Leave me the number one before I lose my mind
Can't be fine 
Havin a time of it 
Duck in a dive 
Keep it alive 
Rock in and ride with it
The devil's hit me tryin to win
But can he keep the pace?

Where we was a star up on a ferry
Suckle on the honey of the Tenessee
Where we would sleep, in the South sunshine

And in the dark, I see the moon
Shine in your eyes, we were so
And that is when, never left and never been to
No such thing
I looked at you, and you looked into me
And we saw in each other, everything
We knew no fear as we grooved through
Best of growing up, we've come to love

On this planet not so far away
We were to stay together
Go roll over in a dream
We drift apart, on down the stream
The honeysuckle taking up in love supply
The snake that lay in the Sun, so fire
I smiled at you and you to me

And in the night, I'd see the dark
Inside of you
Walk from trees to look like wings

To save yourself and your sanity
You'll find another, and I pray he's good to you

Au milieu des Hills et de Beverly 
Dans un ciné désert 
Une chinoise de quinze ans vend du pop-corn 
Dans un kimono vert...

Se perd derrière ses paravents

Nothing's ever planned when I decide
Come on

Alain Bashung,"Nights in white satin
Never reaching the end
Letters I've written
Never meaning to send

Beauty I've always missed
With these eyes before 
Just what the truth is
I can't say any more

'Cause I love you
Yes I love you
oh oh oh I love you

Gazing at people
Some hand in hand
Just what I'm going through 
They can understand

Some try to tell me 
Thoughts they cannot defend
Just what you want to be 
You will be in the end

And I love you",Night in White Satin
Alain Bashung,"She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back
She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back
She can take the dark out of nigh time
And paint the daytime black

You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
Down upon your knees

She never stumbles
She's got no place to fall
She never stumbles
She's got no place to fall
She's nobody's child
The law can't touch her at all

She wears an Egyptian ring
That sparkles before she speaks
She's an hypnotist collector
You are a walking antique

Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
Bow down to her on Sunday 
Salute her when her birthday comes
For Halloween buy her a trumpet 
And for Christmas give her a drum",She Belongs to Me

In the night when lights are low

With all our might
Well alright, well alright

N'être plus qu'un corps
Que tout me soit égal
Plus de mal

Et même si je m'améliore
Ton absence qui me mord,
Oh j'en rêve encore, encore,
Ton départ et mes remords,
Oh j'en rêve encore
Son corps à lui dans ton corps,
Oh j'en crève encore
Encore, encore ,encore",J'En Rêve Encore
Alain Bashung,"Nous sommes tous nés d'amour dans ce vieux pays
Où seuls de vieux, de très vieux singes sont assis
Aux commandes de nos libertés
Aux manettes de nos intégrités

Alors, tapons-nous sur le nez
Ça les fait toujours rigoler
Allez, tapons-nous, entre nous
Ça leur fera toujours de gros sous

Quand ils nous vendront des canifs
Et des idées malsaines
Pour que nos petites vies s'enfouissent
Dans la violence et la haine

Alors quoi, on va coucher dehors
Sous les ponts, sous des ponts d'or
Que d'autres auront construits pour aller de leur cuisine
A leur living

C'est pas du flan, c'est pas du vent
C'est le living-room des vieux singes savants
C'est le living, living, living, living room
C'est pas du flan, c'est le living room
C'est pas du vent, c'est le living room

Nous sommes tous nés, mon ami
Nous sommes tous vivants, c'est inscrit
Dans notre œil, tu vois, au fond ça luit
D'une envie de vivre, d'une envie

De parcourir le monde
Cette bonne terre si gironde
Mais non, mais non, voilà qu'on nous gronde!
Cas sans laisser-passer

Faut pas se laisser aller
A rêver d'une autre vie, mon ami,
Non, faut pas rêver
Car pour rêver, faut des «laisser-passer»

Du papier, pour passer sa vie
De l'autre côté du pont, 
Des ponts d'or, dehors
Y en a des tonnes, c'est pas qu'on les ignore
Car on les voit souvent passer de leur cuisine
A leur living

C'est le living-room des vieux singes savants
C'est le living, living, living, living room
C'est pas du flan, c'est le living room
C'est pas du vent, c'est le living room

Voilà comment, quand on y pense
Nous sommes tous devenus des éléphants
Des gnous, des girafes, des orangs-outangs
Dans nos réserves sous surveillance

Et qu'on n'aille pas s'égarer
En troupeau ou bien tout seul, isolé
Dans les réserves d'à côté
On est sûr de tomber sur un os

Un ostéopathe de première
Qui vous démembrera, c'est son affaire
De vous faire passer l'envie
Des voyages interdits

Interdits dans nos vieux pays
Où seuls de vieux, de très vieux singes sont assis
Dans leur cuisine, ils gambergent
Pour améliorer leur living

Alain Bashung,"Y'a un mariole, il a au moins quatre ans
Y veut t' piquer ta pelle et ton seau

Attend un peu avant de t' faire emmerder
Par ces petits machos qui pensent qu'à une chose

J'ai écrit ton nom avec des clous dorés
Un par un, plantés dans le cuir de mon blouson dans l' dos
T'es la seule gonzesse que j' peux tenir dans mes bras
Sans m' démettre une épaule, sans plier sous ton poids
Tu pèses moins lourd qu'un moineau qui mange pas

Déploie jamais tes ailes, Lolita t'envole pas
Avec tes miches de rat qu'on dirait des noisettes
Et ta peau plus sucrée qu'un pain au chocolat
Tu risques de donner faim a un tas de petits mecs
Quand t’ira à l'école, si jamais t'y vas

Qu'est-ce qu' tu m' racontes tu veux un petit frangin
Tu veux qu' j' t'achète un ami Pierrot
Eh les bébés ça s' trouve pas dans les magasins
Puis j' crois pas que ta mère voudra qu' j' lui fasse un petit dans l' dos
Ben quoi Lola on est pas bien ensemble
Tu crois pas qu'on est déjà bien assez nombreux
T'entends pas c' bruit, c'est le monde qui tremble
Sous les cris des enfants qui sont malheureux
Allez viens avec moi, j' t'embarque dans ma galère
Dans mon arche y'a d' la place pour tous les marmots
Avant qu' ce monde devienne un grand cimetière

Alain Bashung,"Qui ose dire qu'il peut m'apprendre les sentiments
Ou me montrer ce qu'il faut faire pour être grand

Leurs évangiles ont fait de moi un non-croyant

I would, my friend, Fernando

Qu'on regarde leurs guibolles, les garçons s'affolent de ça

Alors faut que ça tombe
Les hommes ou bien les palombes
Les bleres, les khmers rouges
Le moindre chevreuil qui bouge
Fanfare bleu blanc rage
Verres de rouge et vert de rage
L'honneur des milices
Tu seras un homme, mon fils

Elles, pas fières
Sur leurs escabeaux en l'air
Regard implorant, et ne comprenant pas tout
Elles, dans le grave
La faiblesse des hommes, elles savent
Que la seule chose qui tourne sur cette terre
C'est leurs robes légères

Rétines et pupilles
Les garçons ont les yeux qui brillent
Pour un jeu de dupes
Voir sous les jupes des filles
Et la vie toute entière
Absorbés par cette affaire
Par ce jeu de dupes
Voir sous les jupes des filles
La, la, la, la, la",Sous Les Jupes des Filles
Alain Souchon,"Car nos aurores ne sont que des aurores,
Et nos baisers, que des baisers,
Boule unique, voilà notre amour,
Sous les coups de pied du jour le jour.

Car tout s'use si l'on se serre,
Couche d'ozone et effet de serre.
Il trouve, il trouve, pour ce souci,
Le drôle de zèbre, des facéties.
Tout valdinguer, changer sa bobine,
Pour retrouver l'aubépine,
Les cœurs nous piquant d'avantage,
Changeons qui nous sommes,
Changeons d'âge.

Car nos aurores ne sont que des aurores,
Et nos baisers, des baisers,
Les congèles de la vie provinciale
Prennent notre cœur et nous le rendent glacial.

Car tout s'use, si l'on se serre,
Couche d'ozone et effet de serre.
Il se déguise et il te ment,
Il met la main sous tes vêtements.
C'est quelqu'un d'autre et cette nouveauté
Rend ta joue plus colorée.
C'est quelqu'un d'autre et pourtant c'est nous.
Où en sommes-nous? Où en sommes-nous?

Car tout s'use si l'on se serre,
Couche d'ozone et effet de serre.

Le drôle de zèbre, des facéties

Sur un piano électrique
Si tu l'oses
On peut faire de la musique
De ces choses

Allez, chante fort
Ton chagrin sonore
Jusqu'à ce que ton cœur
Devienne un bloc d'or

Allez chante fort
Mets l'dedans dehors
Chante encore jusqu'à ce que t'es mort

Il a volé autour du monde sur des airs
Racontant content ses contes populaires
Une image, il est devenu, messieurs, dames
Mais les images, c'est connu, n'ont pas d'âme

Allez, chante fort
Ton chagrin sonore
Jusqu'à ce que ton cœur
Devienne un bloc d'or

Allez chante fort
Mets l'dedans dehors
Chante encore jusqu'à ce que t'es mort

Une image, il est devenu
Mais les images, c'est connu
N'ont pas d'âme
N'ont pas d'âme

Qui passe entre tes seins, pieds nus
Vers des films, vers des frissons

Y'a toujours le papier collant transparent
Pour remettre au carré tous ces tourments

On était belle image, les amoureux fortiches
On a monté le ménage, le bonheur à deux je t'en fiche
Vite fait les morceaux de verre qui coupent et ça saigne
La voilà sur le carrelage, la porcelaine

Nous, nous, on a pas tenu le coup
Bou, bou, ça coule sur ta joue
On se quitte et y'a rien qu'on explique
C'est l'amour en fuite, l'amour en fuite

J'ai dormi, un enfant est venu dans la dentelle
Partir, revenir, bouger, c'est le jeu des hirondelles
A peine installé, je quitte le deux-pièces cuisine
On peut s'appeler Colette, Antoine ou Sabine

Toute ma vie, c'est courir après des choses qui se sauvent
Des jeunes filles parfumées, des bouquets de pleurs, des roses
Ma mère aussi mettait derrière son oreille
Une goutte de quelque chose qui sentait pareil

Nous, nous, on a pas tenu le coup

Je t'aime, je t'aime, je t'aime
Que les lumières s'éteignent
Je t'aime, je t'aime
Et que ça nous entraîne
Que ça nous emmène

Quel joli discours, ces mots sans rien autour
Je t'aime, je t'aime, je t'aime
Quelle émotion belle
Quelle douceur extrême

Alain Souchon,"Des villas, des mimosas,
Au fond de la baie de Somme,
La famille sur les transats,
Le pommier, les pommes.
Je regardais la mer qui brille dans l'été parfait.
Dans l'eau se baignaient des jeunes filles qui m'attiraient.

Les promenades le long des dunes, en voiture,
Pendant qu'elles regardaient en haut la lune pure.
Je mettais dans mes mains leurs doigts
Et j'étais le roi
Comme dans les chansons d'amour d'autrefois.

Tous ces petits moments magiques
De notre existence
Qu'on met dans des sacs plastique
Et puisqu'on balance,
Tout ce gaspi de nos cœurs qui battent,
Tous ces morceaux de nous qui partent,
Y'en avait plein le réservoir
Au départ.
On avance, on avance, on avance.
C'est une évidence :
On a pas assez d'essence
Pour faire la route dans l'autre sens.
On avance.
On avance, on avance, on avance.
Tu vois pas tout ce qu'on dépense. On avance.
Faut pas qu'on réfléchisse ni qu'on pense.
Il faut qu'on avance.

Le soir avec les petits frères, on parlait.
On voulait tout le monde refaire. On chantait.
Ces musiques et ces mots tendres,
Comme ils datent.
Ces lettres d'amour attendent
Dans quelles boîtes?

La voilà repartie retrouver l’autre abruti qui lui fout des marrons quand il est rond.
Mais ce n’est pas tant cette fille qui me plaît tant.
C’est le mystère qui est dedans. le mystère dedans.

La vie nous dit et nous contredit tout ce déduit de ce qu’on a dit.
Les discours de tous ces bandits.
Les statues de jeux qu’on hisse, qu’on embrasse et puis qu’on dévisse.
Les avions empiqués dans ce désir de kyste les chansons inhabitées,
Les guitares de mais ce n’est pas tant ce monde qui me plaît tant

Triste aux balançoires, disait doucement des mots

Se retrouvait dans le noir et pensait dans son cœur

Every, Every moment that I'm awake. Every, every hour of every day I love how you take my breath away.
[VERSE 1]
In your arms I'm safe, secure, every care around me melt away.When you hold me I forget every word that I wanted to say. I am freely lost in your love there's no one else for me, I surrender, completely. Ooh, ooh...
[CHORUS]
My heart's racing I'm shaking, caught up in the love we're making. This is no, this is no ordinary love. Oh, baby your skin on my skin, it feels so good, I feel like crying. This is no, this is no ordinary love.
[VERSE 2]
I don't ever want to say good-bye, I can never breath never survive. Baby your my reason why I believe there's meaning inmy life. I have faith in love, faith in us and faith that this is right. I surrender, forever, tonight. Ooh, ooh...
[CHORUS]
[VERSE 3]

Before you

Before you, I was empty 
Nothing left, was just a shell 
Before you, loneliness was all I felt 

Didn't want to fall in love no more, 
Was so sad I, fell so many times I hit the floor, hurt so bad 
I didn't want no one to bring me down, was sick and tired 
Then you came to lift me off the ground, and you take me higher 

[Chorus] 
We rise, we rise in love 
You and I, keep rising 
We rise, we rise in love 
Higher, we're flying 
Our love will rise 

Rescued me from all the pain I felt, before I met you 
Dried my eyes and made me smile again, you helped me get through 
Now I know what loves supposed to be, it's like you're flying 
Now I know the love I've found is real, cause it keeps on rising

When the glory's evident
Seldom do we know the glory came and went

Where we reach the next plateau
Beyond belief, beyond belief
And from faith to faith we grow
Towards the center of the flow
Where he beckons us to go
Beyond belief, beyond belief

Leap of faith without a net
Makes us want to hedge our bet
Waters never part until our feet get wet
There's a deeper place to go
Where the road seems hard to hoe
He who has begun this work won't let it go

We have come so far but the journey's long
And we once were weak but now we're strong",Beyond Belief

And if you've learned your lesson well
There's little more for her to tell
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall

The summer knows, the summer's wise
She sees the doubts within your eyes
And so she takes her summer time
Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger
Twists the world 'round her summer finger
Lets you see the wonder of her arms?

And if you've learned your lesson well
There's little more for her to tell
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall",The Summer Knows
Alan Bergman,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

",Where Do You Start
Alan Broadbent,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes
Alan Broadbent,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now
Alan Broadbent,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Alan Broadbent,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love
Alan Broadbent,"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

Alan Broadbent,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever

Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away
I'll find my love some day

Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true",Someday My Prince Will Come
Alan Broadbent,"I wish I knew someone like you could love me
I wish I knew you place no one above me
Did I mistake this for a real romance?
I wish I knew, but only you can answer.

If you don't care, why let me hop[e and pray so
Don't lead me on, if I'm a fool just say so,
Should I keep dreaming on, or just forget you?
What shall I do, I wish I knew",I Wish I Knew
Alan Broadbent,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young
Alan Broadbent,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear

Sings an endless song, for my endless trip around your world

Sometime I’m feeling like a freak because you’re still on my mind and all I can say

And if I pass through it you won't be the one to feel upset
Wish me luck for I'm on my way to death raw
And if I pass through it you won't be the one I ‘ll ever let go

And I know, I know, I know you used to say
Please, love, stay that child,
It was so sweet just you and I
But I know, I know that nowadays 
When he wants to cry
A man has got to hide

Hold my hand tight and firm for I'm on my way
To the other side of the highway, can’t see no footpath on the road
As love comes and love goes around
If I pass through it you won't be the one I will let down

And I know, I know, I know you used to say
Please, love, stay that child,
It was so sweet just you and I
But I know, I know that nowadays 
When he wants to cry
A man has got to hide

When I'm back to the days, I was no one to say or to decide

Only feeling peaceful in the shade
And you may just be a drop in the sea

I just wondered if you were safe

I’ve been a while with no pain since I didn’t see you

Heavy rain on my back
Muddy thoughts, faded hopes
Dirty boots on a floaded track
My burning hands still hold the rope

A polluted rain is now falling down on me
I’ve been a while with no pain since I didn’t see you

And road signs lead me nowhere

There will be blood dripping from my veins
So much hatred dripping from my eyes
Each in every time I’ll have you on my sight

And I don’t want my child to grow up on that ground
It’s all covered with dirt and rusty weapons all around
But as we walk through the battle field we think
That life is a gift and love is everything

When your garden gets floaded, you’re so damn right to be worried

As heaven is so crowded I’d better build my own
Like a season not yet started I’ll be waiting alone

Faded smiles for your useless pride
Yelling, yelling why, a deep cut on your sharpest kniffe

I feel the same about all you have
Your good times, bad times are all mine

Alan Hull,"As she played, magicians seeing all this on the floor,
Belly dancing beauty with a power driven saw
Had myself a nightmare,
Didn't think there could be much more
Then in walked Lord Borgaasha with the lady Eleanor

She tied my eyes with a ribbon,
Of a silken gossamer thread
I gaze with troubled vision,
On an old four poster bed
Where Eleanor had risen to kiss the neck below my head,
And made me come along with her to the land of the dancing dead

But its alright lady Eleanor,
Alright lady Eleanor
I'm alright where I am

She gazed with loving beauty,
Like a mother to a son
Like living, dying, seeing, 
Being all rolled into one
Then all at once I heard some music,
Playing in my bones
The same old song I'd heard for years,
Reminding me of home 

But its alright lady Eleanor,
Alright lady Eleanor
I'm alright where I am

Then creeping on towards me,
Licking lips with tongues of fire
A host of gold and demons,
Screaming lust and ways desired 
And when it seemed for certain, 
That the screams could get no higher
I heard a voice above the rest,
Screaming you're a liar

But its alright lady Eleanor,
Alright lady Eleanor,
I'm alright here in your arms",Lady Eleanor
Alan Jackson,"Love's a gamble every heart will take
You roll the dice in hopes that it won't break
One night I bet on your blue eyes and took a chance
And won a whole lot more than one night of romance

[Chorus]
I won the ace of hearts,that night in the dark
How lucky can one man be
I hold the winning hand any way life deals the cards
No way to lose, cause I've got you my ace of hearts

Love's a numbered wheel you have to spin
There's no need for me to spin again
Cause loving you is paying off more than I knew
I took a little risk and hit it big with you

[Chorus]",Ace of Hearts
Alan Jackson,"She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man

The lady I love loves silk and satin
She was raised uptown with a silver spoon
Well, I was born on a farm just south of Jackson
We had an old Ford tractor and a country moon

She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man

She's Saks Fifth Avenue perfection
Caviar and dignified
Well, I live my life in WalMart fashion
And I like my sushi southern fried

She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man

She loves a violin, I love a fiddle

Alan Jackson,"Well I first kissed you on a hollow log
Down by the river they call the Dog
We fell in love and we vowed that day
Like the flow of the river our love won't change
Well we married that spring and we built a house
On the bank of the river where the rock juts out
Now the river's still here but you've long gone
You left me and the river here all alone

[Chorus]
I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you
I got the Dog River blues

Well the rain came down and the river rose up
Filled up the cab on my pickup truck
It came in the house and down the gall
And washed your picture right off the wall

[Chorus]

Well my heart still yearns and the river still rolls
And I pray someday it'll bring you home
So if you change your mind honey I'll be here
Waiting on the banks of that ol' Dog River

[Chorus]",Dog River Blues
Alan Jackson,"In a small town down in Georgia over forty years ago
Her maiden name was Musik til she met that Jackson boy
They married young like folks did then, not a penny to their name
But they believe the one you vow to love
Should always stay that same

And on the land his daddy gave him, a foundation under way
For a love to last forever or until their dying day
They built a bond that's strong enough to stand the test of time
And a place for us to turn to when our lives were in a bind

And they made their house from a tool shed
Grandaddy rolled down on two logs
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
They taught us 'bout good living
They taught is right and wrong
Lord there'll never be another place
In this world I'll call home

My momma raised five children, four girls then there was me
She found her strength with faith in God and love of family
She never had a social life, home was all she knew
Except the time she took a job, to play a bill or two

My daddy skinned his knuckles on the cars that he repaired
He never earned much money but he gave us all he had
He never made the front page but he did the best he could
And folks drove their cars from miles around
To let him look underneath the hood

And they made their house from a tool shed
Grandaddy rolled down on two logs
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
They taught us 'bout good living
They taught is right and wrong
Lord there'll never be another place
In this world I'll call home
No there'll never be another place in this world
That I'll call home",Home
Alan Jackson,"Has it been ten years
Since we said I do
I've always heard marriage made one seem like two
But you're looking better than you did back then
You still make this old heart give in

[Chorus]
And if I had it to do all over
I'd do it all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again

The preacher man said till death do us part
That seemed like forever to a young man's heart
Now the days seem much shorter
The longer we love
And the memories just keep adding up

If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again",I'd Love You All Over Again
Alan Jackson,"Well she puts her dancing shoes on every night
And comes alive there in the smoke beneath the neon lights
And she don't like those hurtin' songs
Cause she's already lived 'em

She don't get the blues, she gives 'em
She checks her broken heart there at the door 
She ain't looking for romance, she's danced that dance before
Well I pity the next poor fool that gets caught up in her rhythm

Cause she don't get the blues, she gives 'em
She's been on the losing end of love too many times
And she ain't gonna go for anything you've got in mind
So before you start let me impart

These few words of wisdom
She don't get the blues she gives 'em

[Chorus]

She don't get the blues, she gives 'em",She Don't Get the Blues
Alan Jackson,"I could see it coming from a mile away
A heartache lookin' for a place to stay
But I couldn't resist her and I couldn't be cool
Lord can't a woman make a man a fool

[Chorus]
Its an age-old story but it still holds true
There ain't no end to what a man won't do
Hell love some woman til he goes insane
Its a short sweet ride on a runaway train

I was drunk and crazy from her sweet perfume
But I knew stone sober I was being used
Now the heartache lingers like a cheap cologne
She took all she wanted then she was gone

[Chorus]

It was almost worth if for the time we spent
But there ain't no future in a heart for rent
Still she taught me something bout the facts of life
Love cuts quicker than a switchblade knife

[Chorus]

Its a short sweet ride on a runaway train",Short Sweet Ride
Alan Jackson,"Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her
She made leaving me look easy
I wish she'd made it look a little harder

I took her out of Texas
When she was just a girl
But old Tennessee and me
Couldn't take Texas out of her

Oh how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
Then nothin' else would come between the two of us
If Dallas was in Tennessee

By now she's leaving Memphis
And everything we had behind her
Lord I hope the gold band on her hand
Will serve as a reminder
That true love is a treasure
That's very seldom found
But you can't stay together if there's no common ground

Oh how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east

Alan Jackson,"Just another bar
With loud guitars
Smoke and candles burning low
And the same ol' boys
Their backs to the bar
Staring across a crowded floor
Then I hear a familiar sound
Your voice laughing out loud

From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance

So I take a chair
In a corner somewhere
You can't see me
But I can look at you
And I remember those times
When I looked in your eyes
The way that he now looks at you
Deep down I know it's over
But it hurts me when he's so much closer

From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance

And if I can't hold you near me
I'll just hold onto your memory

From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance
I'll always love you from a distance",From a Distance
Alan Jackson,"I parked my car 'round back 
I've got the shades pulled down 
I told everybody including my mama 
I was leaving town 
But I've been right here 
Since you've been gone 
Belly-up at the bottom of a bottle 
Listening to George Jones 

And just playin' possum 
Laying low 
I've got hundred watts of hurtin' 
Coming through the speakers of my stereo 
Don't want to see nobody 
Nowhere I want to go 
I'm just playin' possum 
And laying low 

I'm gonna hide my heart 
And be a love recluse 
Oh I could cry on my best friend's shoulder 
But there ain't no use 
I need an expert on 
The pain I'm going through 
So I'll keep George on the old turntable 
'Til I'm over you

Alan Jackson,"Midnight in Montgomery,
Silver Eagle, Lonely Road,
I was on my way to Mobile,
For a big New Year's Eve show,
Stopped for just a minute, 
To see a friend outside of town,
With my collar up, I found his name,
And felt the wind die down,
And a drunk man in a cowboy hat, 
Took me by surprise,
Wearin' shiny boots, a nudie suit, and haunted, haunted eyes,
He said: ""Friend, it's good to see you, 
It's nice to know you care""
Then the wind picked up and he was gone,
Was he ever really there?

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery,
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky,
Feel that lonesome chill,
'Cause when the wind is right,
You'll hear his song,
Smell whisky in the air,
Midnight in Montgomery,
He's always singin' there, 

Well, I climbed back on that eagle,
Took one last look around,
Red tail lights, shadow moves slow across the ground,
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passin' by,
I can hear that wistle moanin',
I'm so lonesome I could cry,

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery,
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky,
Feel that lonesome chill,
'Cause when the wind is right,
You'll hear his song,
Smell whisky in the air,
Midnight in Montgomery,
He's always singin' there, 

He's always singin' there

Well, Hank's always singin' there",Midnight in Montgomery

I can't take this heartache anymore
She said don't tell me lies and try to please me

And I took her by the arm and said don't leave me
There's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do
Just give me time I'll be the man you've needed

To see the way we used to smile
Before we left love in the closet

Make love shine the way it used to shine
Find the gold beneath the rust

Is there one flame beneath the smoke

Can we save a love that once was strong

Pretty as a picture on the wall

Cryin' over some old memory
A little of my heart is down here dyin'

To really start over
Besides he just wouldn't know how

And his greatest reward is the love of a woman

Well I found some old love letters you wrote me years ago
But the words all ran together when the tears began to flow
Cause you left that water runnin' now it's got nowhere to go
If I can't wash away your memory well I'll just go under slow

[Chorus]

The water's cold and clear
I'm drowning for you dear
Up to my ears in tears",Up to My Ears in Tears
Alan Jackson,"They came from near, they came from far
Following a distance star to where He lay
Not being sure of what it mean, but
Knowing it was their way

And the creatures gathered 'round
And didn't make a sound
And the angels cried

The angels knew what was to come
The reason God had sent His son
From up above
It filled their hearts with joy to see and
Knowing of His destiny
Came tears of love

I've often thought about that night
And wondered if they realized
That star so bright
Was sent to tell all the land
The Son of God would soon become
The Son of Man

And the creatures gathered 'round
And didn't make a sound
And the angels cried

And the angels cried
And the angels cried",The Angels Cried

Just one gift beneath my tree
For the fool who let you leave

About Santa Claus this year

And I'll tell you what I heard

Santa's comin in a pickup
Instead of his trusty sleigh 
He'll have a truck instead of reindeer
To carry him on his way
Cause the weatherman had some problems
He couldn't get snow you see

Santa's gonna come in a pickup truck
When he visits you and me

Santa can't bring his reindeer
He'll leave them far away
But don't you worry 'bout him
He's gonna be here Christmas day

With four-wheel drive and all

To the whining of a diesel down the interstate
Dreamin' 'bout my little girls

Shower up and do just what we came to do
Sing for the people
Count the money and the miles back home to you

With a six-piece band and a guitar in my hand
Singin' songs about my life
All the good times and the bad

Then we say goodbye and we load it up
And head somewhere I've already been
Then I lay down in that double bed alone
And I thank the lord again

For a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing

And the midsummer days sit so heavy
But don't they flow like the breeze through your mind
When nothing appears in a hurry
To make up for someone's lost time

Alan Jackson,"Well I was sitting at a roadhouse down on Highway 41
You were wiping off some ketchup on a table that was done
I knew you didn't see me I was in a corner booth
Of course you weren't my waitress mine was missing her front tooth
So I flagged you down for coffee but I couldn't say a thing
But I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name.

I'm in love with you baby
I don't even know your name
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name

So I ordered straight tequila a little courage in a shot
And I asked you for a date and then I asked to tie the knot
I got a little wasted
Yeah I went a little far
But I finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car

I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name

So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name

The next thing I remember I was hearing wedding bells
Standing by a women in a long white lacy veil
I raised the veil she smiled at me without her left front tooth
And I said where the Hell am I and just who the Hell are you?
She said I was your waitress
And our last name's now the same
'Cause I'm married to you baby and I don't even know your name

Yeah I'm married to a waitress

One way is right and one is wrong
The flesh is weak
But love is strong
She's all I see between the Devil and me

The gates of Hell swing open wide
Inviting me to step inside
I'll be your friend
Because again I know it's him
The flames are spreading everywhere
Through the smoke I see you there
She's all I see between the Devil and me

I hold her in my arms at night
So safe and warm I close my eyes
And a cool breeze blows 'cross our bodies in the dark
Outside her reach is my concern
Somewhere I know the fire burns
She's all I see between the Devil and me

The gates of Hell swing open wide
Inviting me to step inside
I'll be your friend
Because again I know it's him
The flames are spreading everywhere
Through the smoke I see you there
She's all I see between the Devil and me

Alan Jackson,"How long will I love you
I don't really know
I'd like to think forever
Is how far we could go so let me paint a picture
Of how it's gonna be
The day you don't mean everything to me

When a nickel's worth a dollar
And gold ain't worth a dime
When they build a ship
On waters that will take you back in time
When the stars have all been counted
And I stop lovin' you
Honey they'll be driving
Buicks to the moon

Now you don't have to worry
About what comes to pass
This old world may wear out
But my love's gonna last
If they ever build that highway to the moon
I'll just fond somethin' else to promise you

When a nickel's worth a dollar
And gold ain't worth a dime
When they build a ship
On waters that will take you back in time
When the stars have all been counted
And I stop lovin' you

Alan Jackson,"Coffee keeps me up and I can't sleep
And when I drink too much then I can't eat

And that's the way you're turnin' out to be

We still say I love you
We both play the part oh so well
But everyone knows
It's just a sad show
And we're only foolin' ourselves

It's like living in a house with no curtains
The whole world can see what's inside
You can turn out the lights in a house with no curtains
But heartache has nowhere to hide

We could pack up and leave in different directions
If we just had somewhere to go
We just keep on pretending
Afraid of the ending

That she had another lover on her mind

You can tell that by the way I move, When I saw you
I thought that it was hopeless

Girl we've got to take this chance that we've been given, 
If there's a heaven here on Earth

In this old empty house
It's hard to learn what you don't think you need

Never leave the sound of the telephone
But ever since you left
I've been gone

Gone crazy, goin' out of my mind
I've asked myself the reason, 
At least a thousand times
Goin' up and down this hallway
Tryin' to leave the pain behind
Ever since you left, 
I've been gone

I never saw your face this many times
When you were really here
The things you said I never understood
Are now crystal clear
I never spent this much time at home
But ever since you left,

I'll go on loving you

Or the changes in the tide

What strange forces of nature conspired 
To construct the present 
From the past

Lookin' in windows at things I couldn't want
There's Johnson's hardware and Morgan's jewelry
And the ol' Lee king's apothecary
They ware the little man
The little man

I go back now and the stores are all empty
Except for an old coke sign from 1950
Boarded up like they never existed
Or renovated and called historic districts
There goes the little man
There goes the little man

Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
Bout the little man that built this town
Before the big money shut em down
And killed the little man
Oh the little man

He pumped your gas and he cleaned your glass
And one cold rainy night he fixed your flat
The new stores came where you do it yourself
You buy a lotto ticket and food off the shelf
Forget the little man
Forget about that little man

He hung on there for a few more years
But he couldn't sell slurpees
And he wouldn't sell beer
Now the bank rents the station
To a down the road
And sell velvet Elvis and
Second-hand clothes
There goes little man
There goes another little man

Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
Bout the little man that built this town
Before the big money shut em down
And killed the little man
Oh the little man

Now the stores are lined up in a concrete strip
You can buy the world with just one trip
And save a penny 'cause it's jumbo size
They don't even realize
They're killin' the little man
Oh the little man

Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
Bout the little man that built this town
Before the big money shut em down
And killed the little man
Oh the little man

It wasn't long when I was a child
An old black man came with his mule and his plow
He broke the ground where we grew our garden
Back before we'd all forgot about the little man

(bet it's about a woman)
Listen up

Let's begin with the day I met her
And how fast this good ol' boy's world got better
The sky got bluer the grass got greener
In just the first few seconds after I first seen her

Like my favorite song on a new set of speakers
My best old jeans and broke-in sneakers
A home run pitch floatin' right down the middle
The sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle

She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
When it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls eye-perfect
She's right on the money

She's no red lights when I've overslept
She's a three point jump-shot that's nothin' but net
She's a handful of aces when the dealer's done dealin'
And I'm forever on a roll, that's how she's got me feelin'

She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
When it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls eye-perfect
She's right on the money

She's the best cook that ever melted cheese
I ain't much around the house but I aim to please
There's absolutely no reason to doubt her
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her

She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
When it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls eye-perfect
She's right on the money",Right on the Money

Alan Jackson,"Well, I was sent to a place in North Carolina
To check up on a moonshine still
When I got there to my surprise
I could see a little light on the hill

Well, the fire was a glowing and really I was knowing
I was really hot on the track
But in D.C. they said it couldn't be
Well I'll be the one to bring 'em back

'Cause I'm a revenooer man
Yeah, I'm a revenooer man
I got a badge in my pocket and a gun on my hip
Them moonshiners better never make a slip
'Cause I'm a revenooer man
Yeah, I'll get 'em if I can

Well the moon was shining bright and I looked down the river
I noticed on the side of the hill
I can see a red light that was glowing right bright
I knew it had to be a still

There were people down the road said it wasn't far
But I better know someone
'Cause when the moonshiners know I carry a star
I'll bet my bottom dollar I'll have 'em on the run

'Cause I'm a revenooer man
Yes, I'm a revenooer man
I got a badge in my pocket and a gun on my hip

'Cause I'm a revenooer man
Yeah, I'll get 'em if I can

Well when I got back the woods was a bare
They must've knew I was on my way
Well, I heard the branches shatter and they started to scatter
I heard two or three of them say

It's the revenooer man
Yeah, It's the revenooer man
He got a big 45 with loads to fill
Dragging and a shagging to another hill
It's the revenooer man
And he'll get us if he can

It was eighteen feet from the bow to the stern light
Second hand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
Put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, made for the water
Ran her for years, till the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

It was just an old plywood boat
A '75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it make me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make her whine
He'd say, you can't beat the way an old wood boat rides
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half-ton shortbed Ford
My uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
Couple of burned valves and he had it going
He let me drive here when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
Sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With three-speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
And he'd say, a little slower son you're doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now three daughters of my own
To let them drive my old Jeep across a pasture in our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile, and say

Just an old worn-out Jeep
Rusty old floorboard, hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say, turn it left and steer it right
Straighten up girl now you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain

The prettiest thing I'd ever seen in my life

We were together for a long time
Thought it would be for all time

I got her back, I was surprised
In '93, a gift to me on Christmas Eve

That September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or workin' on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children, they lost their dear loved ones
Pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white, and blue
And the heroes who died just doin' what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

Faith, hope, and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turnin'
That September day?
Teachin' a class full of innocent children
Or drivin' down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor?
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you love her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes and hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages
And speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on I Love Lucy reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Stand in line to give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man

Faith, hope, and love are some good things He gave us

Alan Jackson,"Okay I forgot about the trash
I didn't trim the long hairs on my mustache
I didn't buy you a ring I believe it was back in '93
Alright I admit it I forgot our anniversary
I didn't pick the baby this morning at the nursery
That ain't no big thing but it's a gold star for me

You get tired and disgusted with me
But I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked God to try to help me
He looked down from Heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient, I'm a work in progress

I'm sorry I was mad for waiting in the truck
It seemed like hours you getting all dressed up
Just to go to Shoney's on a Wednesday night
I read that book you gave me about Mars and Venus
I think it's soaking in but probably need to re-read it
But I can see now what you've been saying is right

You get tired and disgusted with me
But I can't be just what you want me to be

He looked down from Heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient, I'm a work in progress

I got laid off and we're behind on our bills
I can't cross that picket line down at the mill
I may not have money but I've got my pride
Yeah I know Christmas is just around the corner
And all my love can't keep us any warmer
But look at the bright side
We're both still alive

The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.",Away in a Manger

Alan Jackson,"Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh 
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright 
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight

[Chorus:]
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride 
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank and we got up shot

[Chorus]

A day or two ago, the story I must tell 
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell
A gent was riding by in a one-horse open sleigh 
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away

[Chorus]

Now the ground is white, go it while you're young 
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed 
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! You'll take the lead

In the hearts of all people both near and a far

On the small country roads lined with green mistletoe
Big city streets where a thousand lights glow

Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing let every bell ring

And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
Let it be Christmas

In the eyes of young babies their first fallen snow

Alan Jackson,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.
Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kiddies knock him down.
When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Tryin' to make it without you
On this rainy day in June

Yesterday morning I woke up
On the wrong side of the bed
And on the right side laid a note
I knew what it said
Then the rain came, hasn't stopped
I don't know if it will
But I'll keep waiting with the hopeful heart
On this rainy day in June

It's a rainy day in June
The sky is gray and I am blue
Tryin' to make it without you
On this rainy day in June

The thunder rolls, the lightning flashes
Every thought began with you
I see your face in every clouded paths
On this rainy day in June

It's a rainy day in June
The sky is gray and I am blue
Tryin' to make it without you
On this rainy day in June",Rainy Day in June
Alan Jackson,"I just took your picture off the table
And I just took your picture off the wall
Hide from you anywhere I'm able
But there's one place I can't hide from you at all

[Chorus]
Tennessee, you don't make the whiskey
California, you don't make the wine
And Mexico, you don't make tequila
Strong enough to get her off my mind

Memories seem to know just where to find me
And lately they're all that I recall
And everything in this old house reminds me
Of the love I had and how I lost it all

[Chorus]

Days go by and I still feel the sorrow
And time don't make a difference in the pain
Just sitting here and waiting on tomorrow
Will drive me crazy if I don't go insane

Strong enough to get her off my mind",Strong Enough
Alan Jackson,"The mechanic raised up from under my hood
He shook his head and said, ""This ain't good
Your timin' belt's done shrunk one size too small
Those spark plug wires are a little too long
And your main prodsponder's nearly gone
Your injector ports are stripped and that ain't all""

""Your torque converter's runnin' low on torque
And that water pump's nearly down a quart
But we caught it all in time so you're in luck""
He said, ""I've got the time and I've got the parts
Just give me the word and I'm ready to start
I think we can bring her in for eight hundred bucks""

But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money

Then he said, ""Ain't you that songwriter guy""
And I said, ""Yes I am,"" he said, ""So am I""
He sat down and played me a song by the grease rack
When he finished singin' he gave me a smile
And I closed my eyes and pondered awhile
He said, ""What do you think
Now don't hold nothin' back""

Well, I gave him my most sorrowful look 
And I said, ""This song's got a broken hook
I can order you a new one from Nashville but it won't be cheap
And I know you've been using a cut rate thesaurus
'Cause your adverbs are backed up into your chorus
Now your verse is runnin' on verbs that are way too weak""

But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money

And I said, ""Hold on friend now I'm not through
I hate to be the one to give you the news
But your whole melodic structure's done worked itself loose
It's got so many dotted eighth notes in it
I'd keep her under fifty beats per minute
I mean, that's just me talkin', it's really up to you""

""And you've got a bad safety problem with
That dominant chord with the augmented fifth
Just see how dangerously high it raises you up
So just go on over and work on my car
I'll sit here by the fan and chances are
I can straighten this thing out for..eigh..nine hundred bucks""

You just need someone to lead and take it slow,
So lay your head on my shoulder,
Let me hold you close, that's it
There you go
There you go, you're doing fine
Take each day like a step, one at a time
Put one foot in front of the other
And the next thing you know
That's it
There you go

Every day is like a new beginning
One door opens, while another starts to close
But just slip your arms around me
Cause life's a dance, don't know
That's it
There you go
There you go, you're doing fine
Take each day like a step, one at a time
Put one foot in front of the other
And the next thing you know
That's it

I know how it feels to have your heart crossed
Like the wings of the butterfly

Alan Jackson,"I've been a waiter, a roofer, a clerk
I've shoveled manure till my pride hurt.
When you're starting out, it's all part of the work
To do what I do.
I've been evicted for not making rent
Made my Daddy wonder where my good sense went.
For the price of a dream, my years have been spent
To do what I do.
So I stand here tonight with this six string guitar
To be something I've always been in my heart.
Just for the chance to play you my song
The thrill when I hear you singing along.
It's been worth everything I've been through
To do what I do.
I've played for empty tables and chairs
The drunks that don't listen, the crowds that don't care.
Been told countless times Boy you ain't goin' nowhere
To do what I do.
So I hope the critics and skeptics alike
All bought a ticket to this show tonight.
And they'll see firsthand that I have survived
And what doesn't kill you makes you more alive.
And I'm one of the fortunate few
To do what I do.
There's so much joy this music can bring
So I count my blessings when I step up to sing.
Cause they're so many people who would give anything
To do what I do.
And I thank you.
I can do what I do!",To Do What I Do [Live]

And too much of a good thing is a good thing 
And we've got a good thing going on 

You look in my eyes and see my thinking 
I know when you're happy, and when you're sad 
Some would say it's too perfect 
But I don't think what we have is so bad

Said they're thinking about putting me
On the cover of the USA Today
The story of heart-breaking pain
Picture of the loneliest man they claim in the USA Today

I don't sleep in the nighttime
Darkness reminds me of you
I lost eight pounds since last Tuesday
But I could stand to lose a few
I don't believe I'm too bad

Says I'm bigger than the latest crime

Said forever nice go

You don't have to say things at all
You don't have to paint me a picture
I can see in the writing on the wall

Summer nights and winter days
Mountain sunrise, ocean sunset
Hand in hand in the haze
Now it's cold heart summer evenings
And there's clouds on my sunrise

Another night has made me stop
My weary bones can go no farther
And here is where they'll drop

In my dreams your arms will find me 
They will hold me through the night
Then release me to my journey
As another day grows light

I've got so many miles to go 
And promises to keep
Right now all I want to do

And the road call me to roam

To the place where we call home

But it won't shine brighter than the stars in your eyes
It rises above me so bright and so blue
And I won't see anyone as lovely as you

Take me into the night
Past these lonely dreams in my heart
I love you more than I can show you
More than I could know in my heart

So lay down beside me and hold me tonight
For your love has found me and it feels so right
These thoughts in my mind are so scattered and few
But I won't see anyone as lovely as you

Take me into the night
Past these lonely dreams in my heart
I love you more than I could show you
More than I could know in my heart

The cloud again
And I can't stand to live another day

And I am locked in this room with my sorrow
No escape, no way to get away
And my only connection
With tomorrow
Is hoping that you might decide
Not to stay away

If I could only find sweet love again
To live my life this way
Is too much to bear
Can't find my bluebird anywhere

A pretty little blonde haired girl stole my heart and changed my world
Two kids and a moonlit sky, a little love on a Friday night
Built a fire that just wont quit, that was 1976

My high school days I packed away, set my sights on a bigger stage
Jimmy Carter moved to DC, a Georgia boy just like me, 
Life seemed easy, nothin' much that we needed

It softens the edges of memories you're towin'
It changes the reasons
You wanted to hold her

Days I would take back nights I'd wanna make longer
Moments I'd never just throw over my shoulder
I wish I could back up and start all over

But it's never too late to wanna do better
Love's never easy, changes just like the weather
Some days it's raining some are sunny and blue
There's never perfect but there's faithful and true

Time takes you places you never knew you'd be goin'
It softens the edges of memories you're towin'
It changes the reasons you wanted to hold her

Alan Jackson,"[Chorus]
If Jesus walked the world today, He'd probably be a hillbilly
Common man of men and the King of many
He'd lay his hands on his brother man, save us all from the sinnin'
If Jesus walked the world today, He'd probably be a hillbilly

If He was here today I bet He'd drive a Chevrolet
Workin' at the plant drawin' workers pay
He'd preach in some little country church outside of the city
If Jesus walked the world today, He'd probably be a hillbilly

[Chorus]

His long hair and sandled feet would be in style
Surround himself with the good old boys to tell His tale
He'd have a mighty cross tattoo on his hands by the nail holes that killed Him
If Jesus walked the world today, He'd probably be a hillbilly

[Chorus]

Some folks would say it wasn't really Him
You know they'd probably send Him off to some kind of loony bin

They wouldn't hang Him on the cross but they'd find some way to condemn Him
If Jesus walked the world today, He'd probably be a hillbilly

[Chorus]

Yeah, He'd be a Hillbilly,
I'd bet Jesus be a Hillbilly, Lord, you know He'd be a hillbilly.
(Yeah, hillbilly, if Jesus walked the world today).",If Jesus Walked the World Today
Alan Jackson,"What'll it be he asked,
What do you need tonight
Something cold to drown the fire,
Something hot to stir one up
I'll make it simple I said,
Just two things I'll request
That bottle by your shoulder,
And some quarters for these dollars

[Chorus]
'Cause if you wanna make me happy
Pour me bourbon on the rocks
And play every sad song on the jukebox
Songs of loving and leaving, lying and cheating
Songs of hurting and crying, and even songs of dying
If you wanna make me happy
Pour me some bourbon on the rocks
And play every sad song on the jukebox

A woman he asked,
She left you I bet
I've seen that look that's in your eyes
On a many other face
That's right I said,
I deserved it I guess
But it still hurts me all alone
At night there by myself

And play every sad song on the jukebox.",If You Want to Make Me Happy

Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key

Makes its way through the crack neath the door

Were laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key

I can feel my arms around your life
I can taste your lips against my memory

Alan Jackson,"It happens every time I think about the reasons why
I'm sitting here alone at night and not with you.
Heartache takes control and lets me know
Just what a fool I was and how you can't erase the things you do.

And sorry just can't mend a broken heart, I've handed you
Break apart is what most broken hearts still you to do.

But I made long long way from over you
Don't think I've ever seen so many shades of blue.
They say the time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
'Cause I'm a long long way from over you.

Now over you the sound like some lost city
People tell me how to find it, somehow I just never do
And maybe it's because I never wanted to it all,
Of course now I see that I had the best in you.

That clock just runs in circles, days just go on by
Memories hold me closer, no matter how I cry.

I'm still a long long way from over you
Don't think I've ever seen so many shades of blue.
They say the time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
'Cause I'm a long long way from over you.

That clock just runs in circles, days just go on' by
Memories hold me closer, no matter how I cry.

I'm still a long long way from over you
Don't think I've ever seen so many shades of blue.
They say the time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
'Cause I'm a long long way from over you

C'mon banjo!
How 'bout that mandolin in there
All right flat-top
How 'bout of little pedal steel guitar
Little of bass n' drums now
Aw, c'mon everybody!

Now I got your face inside my locket
I've really tried but I don't think I can stop it baby

You sat beside me last night on the sofa
I took your hand and pulled you a little closer
You kiss my lips and then you let me hold you

Alan Jackson,"I shaved my face and combed my hair, 
Put on a new pair of underwear
And sat on the porch with my Labrador 
Like a hundred other times before
She changed her shoes and freshened up her face, 
Put on some skimpy sexy lace
And finally made her way through the back screen door, 
We loaded up on the front seat of my Ford

[Chorus]
And we went out to dinner and we drove right back home, 
Watched an old movie and drank a half a bottle of rum
Then we turned off the tv and we got right down to it, 
There ain't nothin' left to do now that we've done it

Oh, yeah

It seems like it happens every time, 
We get a chance to reignite that fire
We burn it fast and then retire 
Just before the news on channel five

After all these years it can get routine, 
You can change the order up, or use different names
Try it in the mornin' or the middle of the day, 
The end result's still the same

And there's not a thing I can do
Completely consume all about you

You wake me at night walkin' round in my dreams
The wind blows a smell the roses in bloom
And all I can think of is last night's perfume

And I've never thought that I would get caught

So young I just don't know why
Things happen half the time
Without reason without rhyme
Lovely, sweet young woman
Daughter, wife and mother
Makes no sense to me
I just have to believe

She flew up to Heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waiting
And I know she's smiling saying
Don't worry 'bout me

Loved ones she left behind
Just trying to survive
And understand the why
Feeling so lost inside
Anger shot straight at God
Then asking for His love
Empty with disbelief
Just hoping that maybe

She flew up to Heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waiting
And I know she's smiling saying
Don't worry 'bout me

Will always be of times I'll cherish
And I won't cry 'cause

There's no denyin', I've been hidin' from this thing that's chasin' me
Yeah, I've been runnin', no good at shunnin' all these scars from yesterday
There comes a time you gotta give it up, spin that wheel and try your luck
Never know what you will find, it might be love this time

Not at all like all the rest, you know they say that last is best
Like a rainbow on a cloudy day, just to shout it takes my breath away

Alan Jackson,"When the frantic pace of life attacks me
And weighs me to the ground
I long for someplace to escape
To the one place I have found

No stoplights to obey
No signs or limits there
Just drop the hook
And make your home almost anywhere

Where the sky meets the water
Where the wind is my song
Where the sun is my brother
That's where I belong

The gentle motion of the seas
Just rocks me off to sleep
No sirens, cars or screams
Just quiet ocean breeze

A frigate bird encircles me
A 1000 feet above
She dips her wing and bows her head
Like we share a common love

Where the sky meets the water
Where the wind is my song
Where the sun is my brother
That's where I belong

When the moonlight cracks the edge of night
And stars are everywhere
I can taste the rum and coke
And I can smell that salty air

A light spray across my bow
Cools the evening sun
As it slowly melts into the sea
And tells me day is done

Where the sky meets the water
Where the wind is my song
Where the sun is my brother
That's where I belong

When the common themes of life
They come and overload my brain
I steer my thoughts right to that place
That takes me far away

When the traffic fills that concrete path
That takes me back and forth
I usually sit and dream about
That biggest piece of earth

Where the sky meets the water
Where the wind is my song
Where the sun is my brother
That's where I belong

Where the sky meets the water

Alan Jackson,"It was painted red the stripe was white
It was eighteen feet from the bow to the stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine; put on a motor
Built out of love, made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood that will never be forgotten

It was just on old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make her whine
He'd say, ""you can't beat the way an old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton shortbed ford
My uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With a three-speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it mode me feel
And I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
And he'd say, ""a little slower son you're doing just fine""
Just a dirt rood with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say

It was just an old worn out Jeep
Rusty old floorboard, hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say, ""turn it left and steer it right,
Straighten up girl, you're doing just fine""
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When daddy let me drive

When daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive
Daddy let me drive
It's just an old plywood boat

You were wiping off some ketchup on a table that was done
I knew you didn't see me I was in a corner booth
Of course you weren't my waitress mine was missing her front tooth
So I flagged you down for coffee but I couldn't say a thing
But I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name.

I'm in love with you baby
I don't even know your name
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name

So I ordered straight tequila a little courage in a shot
And I asked you for a date and then I asked to tie the knot
I got a little wasted
Yeah I went a little far
But I finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car
The last thing I remember I heard myself say
I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name

I don't even know your name

So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name

The next thing I remember I was hearing wedding bells
Standing by a women in a long white lacy veil
I raised the veil she smiled at me without her left front tooth
And I said where the Hell am I and just who the Hell are you?
She said I was your waitress
And our last name's now the same
'Cause I'm married to you baby and I don't even know your name

Yeah I'm married to a waitress

The same time trying to hold a strong and optimistic gaze.

When I saw you leaving in my mind.

And the angry starts to surface, looking up, asking why
Then you realize he probably wants the best, as same as I
Days just go by quickly, nights just never end
As time gets so more precious, every sunrise and old friend
Trying to be a post to lean on, a part you learn is hard to play
Asking God to let you take her place or just take it all away.
Hope you’ll wake up in the morning, was all just been a dream
You never take for granted every second that you breathe.

When I saw you leaving, when I saw you leaving
When I saw you leaving in my mind.

And the seconds turn to minutes
And minutes wouldn’t last
And the hours, days and weeks and months
Seem endless and too fast
And the blessings poured from Heaven
Like the rain on that first spring
Since that moment I first saw you
You might not always be with me.

When I saw you leaving, when I saw you leaving
When I saw you leaving in my mind, in my mind.

And a short few words later it all just comes untied?",When I Saw You Leaving (For Nisey)

Alan Jackson,"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see",Amazing Grace

Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger, ever near me

How they ever flood my soul

Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appears

She was barely 17, he was tall and strong and lean
They were deep in love by June
Hand in hand beneath that moon

And she sang a little blue ridge mountain song
And he'd just hum along
And they'd dance all night till dawn
On a hillside all alone

They were young and they were free
Like a mountain melody
In love as they could be
Singing that blue ridge song

Bought a house and settled down
He worked driving all around
All at large from town to town
And he'd come home every night
And she'd be waiting in the front porch light

And she'd sing a little blue ridge mountain song
And he'd just hum along
And they'd dance all night till dawn
On the front porch all alone

They were young and they were free
Like a mountain melody
In love as they could be

They couldn't tell him what was wrong
But they just didn't know
It wasn't very long until Jesus called her home
And he got down on his knees
Said ""God don't take my love from me""

Like she has all along
And I'll dance with her till dawn
On a hill side all alone

In the house that they call home
In his heart there lies a void (?)

I was floating down that black water
Kick back on the Mississippi
On a raft with ol' Tom Sawyer
He got restless down around Memphis
That's where he left me
Said I'm one rambling man
I was gone before you met me

And there I was back in my hometown
That's just how dreams go
Thumb in the air wanted out of there
Heading my own road
Well I hitched a ride with this beatnik guy
Said looks like you read me
My name is Jack Kerouac
I was gone before you met me

You got your homeboys, your hang-around-boys
You fix that roof but your roots to the ground-boys
Pink house, the white fence
Pretty little woman, two point five
Kids, dang right, it's a good life
With boys like me your bound to run the wild side
Like the restless wind you'll never catch me
I was gone before you met me

And just before I awoke
I had a bad nightmare
I was on some lost highway and you were nowhere near
Someone took your hand I wasn't that man
Girl, it sure did hit me
I was cussing fate but it was too late
You were gone before you met me

Yeah, I smelled that coffee
I heard you singing in the kitchen
Walking in got a kiss, you said the sink still dripping
Thank God I'm still driven

You got your homeboys, your hang-around-boys
You fix that sink but your roots to the ground-boys
Blue house, the white fence
Sweet little woman, rocking that good
Miss dang right, it's a fine life

Take your flat iron and your curlers
Your sparkling water and that damn perfume I never liked
Take your black Mercedes all that stuff for ladies
To me you’re just a total blank,
Go on and leave me baby
I don’t need you, I got
Jim and Jack and Hank

That’s right

So I got out the whiskey
I began to listen to songs out in my truck you couldn’t crank
I started feeling empty, then again it hit me

Alan Jackson,"Whoa, aw, yeah
I'm docking out, I'm loading up
Well, I'm out of Alabama, down to Louisiana
Halfway 'bout to New Orleans
Yeah, I'm leaning on my Chevy
Rolling through the levees trying to get to where I wanna be
And I'm looking back at Texas
That's where I reckon I can finally put myself at ease
Check my life there at the border
Everything over my shoulder, just Mexico, Tequila and me
Yeah, there's Mexico, tequila and me, that's all

Well, I'm tired of the rat-race, even tired of her sweet face
Sick of what I'm supposed to be
I need a little time to vegetate my mind
Escape from my reality

That's right

I'm not entirely unhappy, 'cause sometime's life's crappy
Make me wanna stop and run
Take a three-day breather, sip a Margarita
Drift away beside the sea
Just Mexico, tequila and me, ah yeah

Well, my baby wants to hold me
Boss, he wants to scold me, momma won't quit calling me
The bank they want the payments
Sometimes they just can't take it
Got to find a place where I feel free
Just Mexico, tequila and me, ah-ha

Well, I'm out of Alabama, down to Louisiana
Halfway 'bout to New Orleans

Alan Jackson,"Is he tall, is he handsome
Does he make enough and then some
Does he miss you every minute that he's gone
Is he funny, is he witty
Does he tell you that you're pretty
Did he hang the moon, did he do no wrong
Is he Mr. Right, I wonder what he's like
The one you're waiting on

'Cause there's an empty seat beside you
And every guy here's trying to buy you
Something to drink
But you just keep brushing them off
You're watching whatever's on cable
Swirling your glass on the table
Wondering how long is too long
Is he working late, is he worth the wait
The one you're waiting on

How many glasses of Cabernet
How many minutes slip away
How many times were you gonna check your phone
I'm telling you if you were mine
You wouldn't be sitting here counting the time
You'd never spend a single moment alone
I bet he don't get how lucky he is
The one you're waiting on

How many glasses of Cabernet
How many boys can you turn away
How long 'til you turn off your phone
And look up at me, I'd be happy to be

Alan Jackson,"When God paints, birds sing
He colors every feather on a sparrow's wings
When God paints, the wind blows
With a stroke of love, he dips his brush in a rainbow

Sometimes I take for granted the simple things
I can be his biggest critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain

When God paints, the heart beats
Life begins, a season ends and lovers meet
And I've learned that sometimes
It's not always black and white or well-defined
When God paints

Sometimes I take for granted the simple things
I can be his biggest critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain

When God paints, we dance
And I reach across the canvas and I take your hand
And my world is so complete
When I look at you, a masterpiece is all I see
When God paints

Sometimes I take for granted the simple things
I can be his big as critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain

When God paints
I pray I always see the beauty inside the frame

Alan Jackson,"Spread your wings, don't be afraid to try
The world can be hard, you gotta live a little 'fore you die
So open that door, step out in the bright sunshine
Follow your heart, and remember any time

You can always come home
Wherever life's road leads, you can get back
To a love that's strong and free
You never be alone, in your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can always come home

So pack your bags, smile and say goodbye
And chase those dreams, and when you lay down and die
You know that there's someone praying for you every day
Even if you never find your way

You can always come home
Wherever life's road leads, you can get back
To a love that's strong and free
You never be alone, in your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can always come home

When I was young, my daddy said to me
The very same words and I took those words with me
When I was afraid, I'd pull them out and think
Just how much they mean to me

You can always come home
Wherever life's road leads, you can get back
To a love that's strong and free
You never be alone, in your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can always come home",You Can Always Come Home
Alan Jackson,"You can let a gal with freckles on her face
String your blonde hair and a 20 inch waist
Caught my eye like a little red car
She shook my hand and she grabbed my heart

Lord, you never know, no, you never know
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door

Brunette hair and big brown eyes
Perfect little bottom like a rollercoaster ride
Waiting on her table with her lazy anchor on
Big tip, later, lord she let me drive her home

You never know, no, you never know
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door
You never know, you never know

I was down in Atlanta on a Sunday afternoon
Backed into a Honda with a woman dressed in blue
First she wasn't happy but the chemistry began
Two Daiquiri's later, lord, we're walking hand in hand

You never know, no, you never know
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door

So the moral to the story is you better be aware
Love might hit you 'fore you ever know it's there
So keep your motor running and keep it in gear
Listen real close she might just whisper in your ear

Hey, you never know, no, you never know
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door
No, you never know, ah, you never know
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door",You Never Know

So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder,there's lazy music in the rill,
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.

There may be other springs as full and fare,
But the won't be the same, they'll come and go

Alan Jay Lerner,"This is hard to say, but as I wandered through the lea
I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.

It's worth its heartache in ransom
Now when that twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels
When I want rain, I get sunny weather
I'm just as blue, blue as the sky
Since love has gone, I can't get myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
My friend ask me out, but I tell them I'm busy
I've got to get a new alibi
I hang around at home, and ask myself, where is she?

Moving on a stream of dreams
My little memories, those precious memories
Remind me of our crazy schemes

This time we're in it to stay, talk about seizing the day
Write it in ink or in blood, it's the same either way. 
They're gonna damn well pay!
See old man Pulitzer snug in his bed, he don't care if we're dead or alive
Three satin pillows are under his head, while we's begging for bread to survive
Joe, you can stop counting sheep, we're gonna sing ya to sleep
You've got your thugs with their stick and their slugs, Yeah! 
But we got a promise to keep!
Once and for all if they don't find their manners, we'll bleed 'em! (Bleed 'em!)
Once and for all we won't carry no banners that don't spell freedom!
Finally we's raising the stakes, this time whatever it takes!
This time the union awakes, once and for all!
[Newsie]
Come on, boys!
[Ensemble]
Yeah!!
This is for kids shining shoes on the street with no shoes on their feet everyday
This is for guys sweating blood in the shops while their bosses and cops look away
I'm seeing kids standing tall, glaring and raring a brawl
All of these guys who are sick of the lies getting ready to rise to the call!
Once and for all they'll be blood on the wall if they doubt us
They think they're running this town, but this town will shut down without us
Ten thousand kids in the square, ten thousand fists in the air!
Joe, you is gonna play fair, once and for all!
Once and for all!!
Once and for all!!
Once and for all!!
There change coming once and for all
You're getting too old, too weak to keep holding on
A new world is coming for you, and Joe, we is too!
Til once and for all you're gone!

I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.

Has a simple explanation
And it isn't hanky-panky.

They improve all your food and your wine.
It's said that everything you grow in your garden will pretty fine,
Instead, all I ever get is a pain in the neck and a
Yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap!

I've consulted all the sages,
I could find in the yellow pages,
But there aren't many of them...
And the mayan panoramas
On my pyramid pajamas
Haven't helped my little problem.

I've been told someone in the know
Can be sure that his luck is as good as gold,
Money in the bank and you don't even pay for it if you fold
A dollar in the shape of the pyramid that's printed on the back.

It's no lie.
You can keep the edge of a razor as sharp as an eagle's eye.
You can grow a hedge that is vertically straight, over ten feet high.
All you really need is a pyramid and just a little luck.

But the dream seemed to end just as soon as it had begun...
Was I to know?

Was the close at the end of the show.

I am just a dreamer, when i close my eyes
I can fly so close to the sun, that i can not see it rise
Going round in circles, in a silent sky
I am lost for so many worlds
I can not say why
I can not say why

Cause i could not see the light of the world
Show me the fire, in a true believer's eye
Just a traveler, on an endless flight
But no matter which way i turn, i journey into the night
Going round in circles, till the mountains fall
To believe in so many truths
Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all

Maybe there is really nothing there at all
Standing in the middle while the rumours fly around me
Hiding from a shadow on an empty wall

And I must not stop believing in myself
Am I dreaming will the nightmare just go on
And never end

Somebody out there, says that he's you
Somebody out there, talks like you do
He calls up your number
And you can't get through somebody out there

Wish that I could run away and leave it all behind me
Wish I wasn't hurt by all the things they say
If I didn't need to know the simple truth about me
Wouldn't it be easier to walk away

And I don't need more confusion in my life
No more pain and disillusion in my life
If I'm dreaming will the nightmare just go on
And never end

Somebody out there, you get the blame
There's doubt and suspicion
It's hard to explain somebody out there

And I don't need more confusion in my life

You heard some talk about a slippery slope

He rocks in his chair like a shiny dime
But it's all for show, all for show.
Wearing your name and a number or two

When the minute's up, so are you
But everybody knows, everybody knows.
Watching the hour from the light in his eyes,
He waits for your soul to come in from the sky

But it's lost below, lost below.
Turning the Wheel of your destiny round,
When the motion stops - no more sound,
Does anybody care, anybody care.
Where's the man, where's the child

Wrapped together side by side.
Who can tell you what to do,
When Mr. Time has come for you.
See the truth, hear the lies,

Can there be no compromise
And who can tell you what they knew,
When Mr. Time has come for you.
Is it a feeling of deja vu?

When he points his finger calling you
Is it illusion? Just an illusion
Picking up seconds that fall to his feet
He blows them away as rocks on his seat,

Cool as his smile, his smile.
Where's the man, where's the child
Wrapped together side by side.
Who can tell you what to do,

Alan Parsons,"Waves roll out
Out to sea
Tasting the saltwater
Tears upon her cheek

Morning breaks
She's not there
Who could ever find her?
Who would eve care?

No one heard
No one came
No angel of mercy
Appears to know her name

Where is hope
When words fail
All the colours running
Inside when life turns pale

In the dick the boats are harboured
Where the water's cold and still
Oh life, she cries, I've lost the will

>From the bridge she sees a lifetime
Oh life, she cries

Only clouds her eyes

Swirling in a trance
Her eyes upon the water
Alone in her last dance

As she cries into the dawn
""Oh life, I'm barely holding on""

And she sees her future falling
Til it finds the ocean floor
Oh life, she cries

There must be more

And with the early light
She'll sail into the clear
The winds are all behind her

But her spirit longs to soar

Adrift upon a rolling sky
The miracles escape my eyes
But I still hope

Time, regret
Is this as good as life can get?
It's only when the spirit sets me free I cope

If I seek in every corner
If I search in every doorway
When the water turns to wine will I believe?
If I navigate the river
Would you take me to your island?
Sing s siren song so I can never leave

Long and wide
Eternity from side to side
Lead me through the rapids
guide me to the shore

There's a place
That's far beyond this time and space
When each of us comes face to face with something more

If I open up the channel
Would you send me information
If you tune me to your station I'll receive
If I navigate the river
Would you take me to your island

""Mr Jones isn't home
He'll be gone for the day""

To adjust his disguise

Which he proudly denies

Where to go from here
I can't hide from each face I see
Looking out from behind them is me

I'm attempting to guess
What they meant when they said
""Mr Jones and his guest
won't be using the bed""

So if I take the rap
While they stay out of sight
I can spring from the trap
When the timing is right

One minute I think I know what I mean
The next I hear voices inside disagree
Why are they laughing at me?

So I pick up the phone
Someone's asking to me
Is the real Mister Jones
Mister one, two or three?

So I say that they're not
But it's not as I say
'Cos they're all taht I've got
And I can't get away

And Alice wawes through the glass
Are we home at last
For tomorrow they'll be there you see
Locked away safe inside there with me

'Cos tomorrow they'll be here you'll see

Alan Parsons,"The clock struck midnight,
Then through my sleeping,
I heard a tapping at my door.
I looked but nothing
Lay in the darkness
And so I turned inside once more.
To my amazement,
There stood the raven.
Whose shadow hung above my door.
Then through the silence,
It spoke the one word
That I shall hear forever more:
Nevermore!
Thus quoth the raven:
Nevermore!
And still the raven
Remains in my room
No matter how much I implore.
No words can soothe him;
No prayer remove him.
And I must hear forever more:
Quoth the raven: Nevermore!
Thus quoth the raven: Nevermore!
Thus quoth the raven: Nevermore!
Thus quoth the raven: Nevermore!
Nevermore! Nevermore! Nevermore! Never!

Locked in the mind on the edge of time
Like a ship lost in a storm
How do we find the key

Longing to see, through the artist's eye
Maybe only birds can fly
The man must be insane who knows
A mind alive with images so strange

So close but never rode the sky
Watching the birds as they sail on the wind
Trying to figure out the reason why
Picturing wings held together with string

One day to fly
Someone said and i believe
Try if you dare, you can walk on air
A dream is all you need

A circle that takes you high
Lighter than air as the earth goes by
Through a spiral in the sky
The man must be insane who knows

A mind alive with images so strange
So close but never rode the sky
Watching the birds as they sail on the wind
Trying to figure out the reason why

Picturing wings held together with string
Just a charcoal sketch on canvas
Made them laugh but now they see
That the artist had a vision

That the wind could set us free
It's a bridge until tomarrow
Taking us beyond the sun
As the artist paints his picture

Analyzing, criticizing
Fear of the unknown
Theorizing, visualizing

The road to take us home

There can be no consolation prize
Not in our eyes

We can't wait one more day
We need someone to light up the way
We may run out of time
Can you hear what we say?
Because heaven is so far away

Although time is getting short
There's still some sand left in the glass
And now we have a living breathing
Rocket man at last
It's time to take a step
And nail our colours to the mast

No more talk of great adventures
When it's movement that we need
It must be our intention
That we never loose the lead
So count us down to zero
And let's get up to speed

Holding us within this maze
Every path we take, leads us astray

Comfort me, my only son
Till the day my work is done
There's no earthly reason, we should stay

And when the wind gets under these wings
You will feel what freedom brings
Stay right by me, walk, don't run
I don't want you flying too close to the sun

Turn your eyes towards the light
Steal away in silent flight
The skies are calling out to you and me

Over sea and over land
God protect us with your hand
Bring us safely to our destiny

And when the wind gets under these wings
We can taste what freedom brings
Stay right by me, walk, don't run
I don't want you flying too close to the sun

God, forgive his fall from grace
The sea conceals his resting place
Can we learn to stay behind the line?

If we have the means to fly
Some of us will surely die
Being reckless was his only crime

And when the wind gets under these wings
We can taste what freedom brings
Stay right by me, walk, don't run

Too close to the sun, too close to the sun, too close

Alan Parsons,"There are unsmiling faces and bright plastic chains
And a wheel in perpetual motion
And they follow the races and pay out the gains
With no show of an outward emotion

And they think it will make their lives easier
For God knows up till now it's been hard

But the game never ends when your whole world depends
On the turn of a friendly card
No, the game never ends when your whole world depends
On the turn of a friendly card

There's a sign in the desert that lies to the west
Where you can't tell the night from the sunrise
And not all the King's horses and all the King's men
Have prevented the fall of the unwise

For they think it will make their lives easier
And God knows up till now it's been hard

But the game never ends when your whole world depends
On the turn of a friendly card
No, the game never ends when your whole world depends
On the turn of a friendly card

But a pilgrim must follow in search of a shrine
As he enters inside the cathedral

You see the stars far away
You're seeing them because of the light
Which travels from them to you

Now it takes time for light to travel here
So what you're doing is seeing the stars as they were in the past
The amount of time it has taken for the light to reach us
And the further and further away those stars are
The further back in time you are looking

Now you are seeing a star that is say six thousand years ago
Imagine somebody on that star looking at us
They would be seeing us as we were six thousand years ago
Which of those two is now?

 (Lead vocal - Chris Rainbow)
 There are unsmiling faces and bright plastic chains
 And a wheel in perpetual motion
 And they follow the races and pay out the gains
 With no show of outward emotion
 And they think it will make their lives easier
For God knows up till now it's been hard
 But the game never ends when your whole world depends
 On the turn of a friendly card
 No the game never ends when your whole world depends
 On the turn of a friendly card
 There's a sign in the desert that lies to the west
 Where you can't tell the night from the sunrise
 And not all's the king's horse and all the king's men
 Have prevented the fall of the unwise
 For they think it will make their lives easier
 And God knows it's been hard
 But the game never ends when your whole world depends

Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Alan Pownall,"We caught up easy, 
I was up and you were down
Your face reads nothing
But It made you sound
So I'm not about
To show you up and weep

I've seen you flicker
Out the corner of my eye
It? made me look up
As you passed us by
So you broke a smile
And turned your back to leave

You're timeless, I'm only wanting more
When you were running by, did I look unsure?
Cause you played me along
And I'll never leave it down.

You didn't have to become
Chasing time
I only ever wanted to make you mine
But I was always too far from your side
I got left behind

It sunk in deeper
When I woke up you were gone
I said I'm easy but
But It's been too long
Cause? you left enough
To leave me wanting more

I know you figured
I'll be better when in time
I let you go
And got get my next in line
Took a second best
And you will never know

Cos you're timeless, I'm only wanting more
When you caught my eye did I look unsure
Cause you played me along
Now how can I leave it down

You didn't have to become
Chasing time
I only ever wanted to make you mine
But I was always too far from your side

Now how can I leave it down

Alan Pownall,"If your mind seeds so many questions
Misery is never gone astray
Your trail, my thought, what an awkward
System to be playing on the brain
My make-up, the pillow when I wake up
Stains in a way that seems to drown me
It's rude to point but attention's what I want
And she told me that I look like David Bowie

It's all in my mind now
But I can't help thinking why it's so so quiet
When I woke up it was like this
What a colorful day I have been welcomed with

Still in focus I wanted you to notice
Everything I'm trying to improve
Up early, I'm telling you a story
So look at me when I'm talking to you
A private number, I'm curiously under
The impression that I'm subject to surveillance
So tragic, I'm mixed up in the magic
And everybody's trying to make a difference

It's all in my mind now
But I can't help thinking why you're so so quiet
When I woke up it was like this
What a colorful day I have been welcomed with

You never wanted anything more

Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead

When will I ever learn?

Why do lies make my love stronger

Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy

But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

There's just one round I've gotta win,

Don't let me down! Baby, say that you'll be stayin',

If you went away then I'd be left without any pride.

I've given up so many things, Don't ask me to give up on you.

Girl, don't let me down!  Just Once In My Life,
let me hold on to one good thing I found!
Don't let me down! Baby, say that you'll be stayin',
 
That old pot of gold ain't so easy to find,
But if you stand by me, I'll keep my peace of mind.
I can't give you the world, But I I'll work hard for you, girl.

Shut softly your watery eyes

And there's no use in tryin'
T' deal with the dyin' 
Though I cannot explain that in lines

I still wish to kiss 
As to be under the strength of your skin

A vacuum a scheme babe

Has been twisted and fed
By worthless foam from the mouth
I can tell you are torn

Alan Price,"In the morning sun when no one
Will be drinking any more wine
I'll wake the sun up by givin' him
A fresh air full of the wind cup
And I won't be found in the shadows hiding sorrow
And I can wait for fate to bring around to me
Any part of my tomorrow, tomorrow

Cause it's oh, so peaceful here
No one bendin' over my shoulder
Nobody breathing in my ear
Oh, so peaceful here

In the evening shadows are callin' me
And the dew settles in my mind
And I think of friends in the yesterday
When my plans were giggled in rhyme
I had a son while on the run
And his love brought a tear to my eye
And maybe some day he'll up and say
""We had a pretty nice time""
Oh my, oh my

Cause it's oh, so peaceful here
No one bendin' over my shoulder
Nobody breathing in my ear

Alan Price,"I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I was hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her""
Yah! Hey, hey, hey
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah!
Ah, I was made to love her
Built my world all around her

Oo baby, I was made to please her

Alan Senauke,"Man walks along the railroad track
He's Goin' some place, there's no turnin' back
The Highway Patrol chopper comin' up over the ridge
Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge
The shelter line stretchin' around the corner
Welcome to the New World Order
Families sleepin' in their cars out in the Southwest
No job, no home, no peace, no rest, NO REST!

And The highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Searchin' for the Ghost of Tom Joad

He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag
The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
He's waitin' for the time when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
With a one way ticket to the promised land
With a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Lookin' for a pillow of solid rock
Bathin' in the cities' aqueducts

And The highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
With the Ghost of old Tom Joad

Now Tom Said; ""Ma, whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy
Wherever a hungry new born baby cries
Whereever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me ma'
I'll be there
Wherever somebodies stuglin' for a place to stand
For a decent job or a helpin' hand
Wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free
Look in their eyes ma,
You'll see me! [repeat 8 times]

When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight.

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Lovely never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.

To burn it down

To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

You told me yes
You held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down, when I kissed that ring
You lost that right, to hold that crown
I built you up, but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down

Surrounded by hopelessness 
He finds the will to fight

And even though we know the bridge has burned 
He will return

Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me

But I don't get the greed.
Y'know, they all seem pretty crazy to me.

Alana Davis,"I remember the long warm December we shared.
I can still taste the air.
You were open and I was hoping you cared,
Hoping that you would be there for me.
That's the way it was meant to be,
But I guess your heart was free;
Free to take the best part of me,
And leave a hole where my heart should be;
Where it used to be.
Days are lonely, and nights are only a veil,
And the air is so stale.
I'm still open but I guess you were hoping we'd fail,
So you could sail away from me,
And return to your open sea;
Where I guess you need to be,
Where you can wander endlessly.
Still you know that your heart was free,
And you took the best part of me,
And left a hole where my heart should be;
Where you know it should be.
You're for me.
I'd have sworn it was destiny,
But I know you were always free;
Free to be the best part of me.
I'd have loved you endlessly,
With my heart and soul eternally.
A love the way love should be, ain't that the way a love should be?
You are free;
Free to give back the heart of me,
And replace all this misery.
Since you took the best part of me,
And left a hole where my heart should be;
Where my heart should be.",Free
Alana Davis,"I'm having a notion.
It's a strange, the strangest emotion.
I'm all wrapped up with my head in the clouds.
The sweet child thinks he doesn't deserve me, but I'm not that proud.
I'd walk for miles to see that handsome face;
To be with you baby I'd go anyplace.
So you say that you ain't got money, well I don't care.
'Cause I'm so in love with you, honey.
What I got, I'll share.
Take me by the hand, help me move my mountains aside.
Help me understand that love is stronger than...
It'll serve you longer than pride.
Now father, lend me your strength.
I know you think I'm weak, but I'm not ashamed.
'Cause I'm in love, and I'll tell you it's real.
I may be young but I know what I feel.
So you think he's gonna up and leave me? I disagree.
He said that he'd give up the world just to please me, and care for me, he'll
Take me by the hand, help me move my mountains aside.
Help me understand that love is stronger than... 
It'll serve you longer than pride.
When I first looked in his eyes, I felt this chemistry.
And much to my surprise, here's a man full of beauty, and free of greed.
And I'll stand by him 'cause he's all that I need.
The sweet child thinks he doesn't deserve me, but I'm not that proud.
Said it once, but I don't think he heard me, so I'll say it out loud...",Love and Pride
Alana Davis,"At night as we lay down to sleep
I wonder what you'll show me
I think of you
and the thoughts that you keep
And I, I wonder do you know me
Everything that I have
is broken in two
Everything that I am
revolves around you
And you just don't understand
What a girl goes through

Everyone believes in something
Though we give it different names
You can search the world for that one thing
But it's all the same

Lay your body down
Come and let me bring your
body down
Listen to my voice
the only sound
As I lullaby you,
lullaby you down

As the moon rides away from the sun
She takes all his light and reflects it
I relate them to us just for fun
There's a parallel that's unexpected
Every star in the sky,
reminds me of you
Twinkling in my eyes,
The way that you do
And I don't know why
I get so blue

Everyday is filled with changes
No matter where you go
Living in a world of strangers
So we go for what we know

Lay your body down
Come and let me bring your
body down
Listen to my voice
the only sound
As I lullaby you,
lullaby you down

Everyone believes in something
But it's all the same
Attitude will keep me going
So I guess I can't complain

Lay your body down
Come and let me bring your
body down
Listen to my voice
the only sound
As I lullaby you,
lullaby you down

Alana Davis,"There's a bleeder in my kitchen,
And he's pouring on my floor.
There's a killer in my hallway,
And he's scratching at my door.
I think I might have heard some screaming;
I might have heard somebody cry.
Now I wonder am I dreaming,
Or is my mind telling me a lie?
Well I can't run any further,
And I can't hide anymore.
And I think there's been a murder,
Up on the ground floor.
There's a boa in my bathroom,
And he's coiling in my sink;
He wants my cats I think.
Paranoia in my house now, and I'm balanced on the brink.
Well I can't run any further,
And I can't hide anymore.
And I think there's been a murder,
Up on the ground floor.
I'm living in a basement flat, in a quiet part of town.
I bet you wonder where my head is at, when I'm imagining all these sounds.
I'd check it out but I'm glued to my chair;
I can't make it to the door.
I could be bugging, but I'd gladly swear:
I just heard a body hit the floor,
And I can't run any further.
I can't hide, I can't hide anymore,
And I think there's been a murder, up above me on the ground,
On the ground floor.",Murder
Alana Davis,"Looking to the sky, wishing for a sun.
Lowering the high, before the trip's begun.
Passing time, acting blind, taking the easy way out.
Every day you spend wasting away.
You don't care what life's about,
But you will one day.
You will one day, you'll be hurting some day, you will one day.
Said you'd be the one,
Said you'd always be there.
But you're caring for none,
And your promises they drift into the air.
Every night you want to start a fight;
Trouble's what you're made of.
You can't be tied, you can't look inside.
Don't want anyone to love.
But you will one day,
You will one day, you'll be hurting some day, you will one day.

Alana Davis,"The laws of reason tend to leave me cold
Ignore every season every season still I grow old and cold
I've contained my future by holding on to the past
And I blame my teachers for letting me too fast
And I wonder now can I survive between wired awake and half alive
When I can't succeed I can only try to validate each day
And I'm losing though I'm using my best
And I'm choosing to destroy all the rest of yesterday
They'll suck you in with I believe in yous
And let you think it's your gifts that make them choose you
Now I discover the catch about being real
It can make liars out of lovers who can't handle what you feel
And I work so hard just to keep it clean
I do unto others you know what I mean
I got a backstage pass to my next dream that says I'm not alone
And I'm losing though I'm using my best
And I'm choosing to destroy all the rest of yesterday,

Alana Davis,"Another Sunday, another one way road away from home 
I keep thinking one day I'm going to wake up far from what I've known 
There's a man, he's going to cheat me if he can 
He's looking for someone to scam 

Here I am with my guts out in my hand, looking for some place to stand 
It's hard to hold on to what you're found when what comes around always goes around 
Here we go round and around on the outside 
Do we know how to hold on with our hands tied? 

Another Sunday ,ain't no change in how we're living now 
I keep hoping one day maybe Monday will be, will be different somehow 
In the end there are lovers, there are friends, there are liars who pretend 
They'll cheat you if they can- seems to be their master plan 

To leave you with an empty hand 
And it's hard to hold on to what you're found when what comes around always goes around 
Here we go round and around on the outside 
Do we know how to hold on with our hands tied? 

Here we go turning around one the inside 
Do we know how to hold ..can we survive?

He'd give is turtle, to be six feet tall.
He's got photos of Shaq and Ewing, up on his wall.
And he'd try a jump shot but he's afraid he'll fall down.
Little girl wants to fall in love.
Dressed up like her mother, in white evening gloves.
She pretends, tells her friends she's got somewhere to go.
They don't ask her where, so they'll never know how she feels.
With a shorter past, there's a greater hurry.
Let the moment last, there's no need to worry.
We should be living for today, or tomorrow anyway,
And don't ask for the world on a plate,
'Cause you just might get it.
Don't ever say it's too late, you know you'll regret it, because
Just when you're sure, your life can change right before your eyes.
A mother's thinking of her little boy,
Left home at sixteen back in eighty-four.
He's got a dog named Lucy, says she's all he needs.

But it stays this way
Today and everyday

That today will feel a different way

The weight of the world has fallen
And the rubble is at my feet
The voice of a girl is calling
I can hear her
But she?s buried so deep
All of my truths are broken
They?re fragments of love and hate
The words that remain are a token
Of honesty that came too late

Here
In the midst of madness
Washed up by the tides of war
Try to resist this sadness
But the pressure is hard to endure

Yet we begin again
Still playing our games
And everyone?s innocent
Just victims of change

Wearing a mask of freedom
And hiding behind a smile
Playing the role of a leader
Pretending for just a while
Everything seems an illusion
Echoing around my brain
Trapped in a vast seclusion
Where the images fall like rain

And we begin again
Still playing our games
And everyone?s innocent
Just victims of change
Living in sin again
With no one to blame
And everyone?s innocent
Just victims of change

I wanted, but now 
I don't know how you got me, babe

But most of the time we use it in the wrong way
Some people say that they got your back
But you can tell a true friend by the way they act

And if you ask me now I can't be much help
'Cause a friend's somebody you judge for yourself
Doesn't matter what I think, I see
Because a friend to you might not be a friend to me

Some are mellow and they act cool
Others treat you like you're a fool
Some are always on your side
And others just want to take you for a ride

And this list goes on again and again
But these are the people that we call friends

Friends, how many of us have them?
Friends, ones we can depend on
Friends, how many of us have them?
Friends, before we go any further let's be friends

When we first hooked up, we barely knew each other
I never thought you would be my lover
Talking on the phone for hours at a time
Or I was at your house or you were at mine

And then came all the fights and all the problems
Turned out that was all we had in common
And even though we started out strong
I guess, we went about the whole thing wrong

And I should've known it would come to an end
'Cause we became lovers before we were friends

The list goes on and on, again and again and again and again
True friends show you more than you can see
But some people leave you on your knees
With friends like that you don't need enemies

Alana Davis,"I've seen suckers loose themselves in the games they learn to play, 
Children love to sing but then their voices slowly fade away. 
People always take a step away from what is true, 
That's why I like you around, 
I want you. 
Yeah you do... you make me want you. 
An open invitation to the dance, 
Happenstance set the vibe that we are in, 
No apology because my urge is genuine, 
And the mystery of your rhythm is so feminine. 
Here I am and I want to take a hit, 
Of your scent and it bit, 
So deep into my soul, 
I want you. 
You do you do, you make me want you. 
Send me all your vampires, 
And I can't get enough, 
And I can't get enough, 
The village church yard is filled with bones weeping in the grave, 
The silver lining of clouds shines on people Jesus couldn't save, 
You want to know how deeply my soul goes, Deeper than bones, 
I want you, 
And I can't get enough. 
After we did it by the window sill, 
Smoke rings drift into the midnight sky, 
presently in the quilt that your mother made, 
And a candle burns to fight off the gloom, 
I said to live in this way is not for the meek, 
but you talk real soft and kiss me on the cheek. 
And like a jazz DJ you talk me into sleep, 
There will be no regrets when the worms come, 
And they will surely come.

And every day I drown emotions with the tide
And no one's ever asked me why
Guess I'm silly to waste my time

I reach and stretch too far to measure
And I break myself to keep together all the time
It's a struggle to be kind
In a world that seems so blind

Before I grow too old to seize the day
Before I spread my wings and fly away
I'd like to get to see my heart at play
And see if love can't save the day
What if it's the only way
Can we save the day

Aside from my faith there is no glory
And aside from the truth there is no story anymore
We're all soldiers in the war
But tell me what are we fighting for

Feels like we've been here forever
As I break myself to keep together and apart
From a way that eats my heart
I don't know how it got so hard

Before I grow too old to seize the day
Before I spread my wings and fly away
I'd like to get to feel my heart at play
See if love can't save the day

And isn't it ironic, don't you think
A little too ironic, and yeah I really do think

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought, it figures

Well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
And life has a funny way of helping you out
Helping you out.",Ironic
Alanis Morissette,"An old man turned ninety-eight
He won the lottery and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought, it figures

Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down he thought
""Well, isn't this nice.""
And isn't it ironic, don't you think

[Chorus]

Well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out when
You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up
In your face

A traffic jam when you're already late
A no smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife
And isn't it ironic, don't you think
A little too ironic, and yeah I really do think

Well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
And life has a funny funny way of helping you out

Alanis Morissette,"Do I stress you out?
My sweater is on backwards and inside out
And you say, how appropriate
I don't like to dissect everything today
I don't mean to pick you apart you see
But I can't help it

And there I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off
Slap me with a splintered ruler
And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already
If only I could hunt the hunter

And all I really want is some patience
A way to calm the angry voice
And all I really want is deliverance, ah

Do I wear you out?
You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung out
I'm consumed by the chill of solitary
I'm like Estella
I like to reel it in and then spit it out
I'm frustrated by your apathy

And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land
If only I could meet the maker
And I am fascinated by the spiritual man
I am humbled by his humble nature, yeah

And what I wouldn't give to find a soul mate?
Someone else to catch this drift
And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred? Ah

Enough about me, let's talk about you for a minute
Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while
The conflicts, the craziness and the sound of pretenses is falling
All around, all around

Why are you so petrified of silence?
Here can you handle this?
Did you think about your bills, you ex, your deadlines
Or when you think you're going to die?
Or did you long for the next distraction?

And all I need now is intellectual intercourse
A soul to dig the hole much deeper
And I have no concept of time other than it is flying
If only I could kill the killer

And all I really want is some peace man
A place to find a common ground
And all I really want is a wavelength, ah
And all I really want is some comfort
A way to get my hands untied
And all I really want is some justice, ah

It's all I really want, some patience
A way to calm me down
And all I really want is deliverance
A place to find a common ground",All I Really Want
Alanis Morissette,"You know how us Catholic girls can be
We make up for so much time a little too late

I'll see you next Sunday

We all had our reasons to be there
We all had a thing or two to learn
We all needed something to cling to
So we did

I sang Alleluia in the choir
I confessed my darkest deeds to an envious man
My brothers they never went blind for what they did
But I may as well have
In the name of the Father, the Skeptic and the Son
I had one more stupid question

We all had our reasons to be there
We all had a thing or two to learn
We all needed something to cling to
So we did

What I learned I rejected but I believe again
I will suffer the consequence of this inquisition
If I jump in this fountain, will I be forgiven

Alanis Morissette,"I had no choice but to hear you
You stated your case time and again
I thought about it

You treat me like I'm a princess
I'm not used to liking that
You ask how my day was

You've already won me over in spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault

Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole
You're so much braver than I gave you credit for
That's not lip service

You've already won me over in spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault

You are the bearer of unconditional things
You held your breath and the door for me
Thanks for your patience

You're the best listener that I've ever met
You're my best friend
Best friend with benefits
What took me so long

I've never felt this healthy before
I've never wanted something rational
I am aware now
I am aware now

You've already won me over in spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault

You've already won me over in spite of me

As you place the don't disturb sign on the door

It's a long way down
On this roller coaster
The last chance streetcar
Went off the track
And you're on it

I hear you're counting sheep again, Mary Jane
What's the point of trying to dream anymore
I hear you're losing weight again, Mary Jane
Do you ever wonder who you're losing it for

Well it's full speed baby
In the wrong direction
There's a few more bruises
If that's the way
You insist on heading

Please be honest Mary Jane
Are you happy
Please don't censor your tears

You're the sweet crusader
And you're on your way
You're the last great innocent
And that's why I love you

Worry not about the cars that go by

You've got to measure up

How long before you screw it up
How many times do I have to tell you to hurry up

The least you can do is keep quiet

Be a good girl
You've gotta try a little harder
That simply wasn't good enough
To make us proud

I'll make you what I never was

Portable phone he ain't speakin' to the people
In their Hollywood homes with a toot
In your snoot and your loot to boot
You don't even give a hoot about the
Minds you pollute

Lookin' for deceptions there's more to me
Than human flesh I'm finding new
Directions I need some tenderness!

Alanis Morissette,"Whenever we talk about sun all I see is the rain
It's like looking for tears in a ocean
I'm hearing your words like the wind
They blow straight through my heart
Will you ever give in to emotion

And we hurt the ones that we love the most
Why we do only heaven knows
And I don't know why I'm still holding on holding on

I reach in my heart to see
If your love is alive in me
But now I feel alone
My feelings turn to stone
My heart makes no apologies

When an apology's made it isn't always enough
To erase all the past in a moment
Whenever I need you the most
You always leave me behind
With a word from your lips I'm alone

You've been blind not to realize
All the love that I hold inside
So tell me why do I keep holding on holding on

What I need is your sympathy
Like a light flowing into me
But I will never give up holding on holding on

My heart makes no apologies no no
My feelings turn to stone I make no apologies",No Apologies
Alanis Morissette,"My name is Alanis. I'm a white chick singer
The drums are a-smokin' and so's the bass
Shake your thing
When you sing
Just sixteen
No disco queen

A lession 4u I'm your teacher girl
Two words you'll be hearin' will
Shake the earth so repeat after me

Go insane

Rules your world

Now don't overdo it when you shake your thing
Cause you'll be goin' insane when you start

Could be a casuality case if they sing
These words

",Oh Yeah!
Alanis Morissette,"Why do I feel it's all up to me to see that
Everything's right and it's how it should be
Why don't they just leave me alone
I've got to prove I can
Little girl with stars in her eyes they've
Got her all figured out and there's nowhere
To hide why can't they all see who I am
When will they understand

It may take some time they don't know how
It feels because they can't read my mind
They always say I'm too young and they
Feel they should help me
But I can make it all alone out here on my own
Every day I feel so in demand and all I
Wish I could find is a place I can land
One day I'll feel comfort inside cause I'll
Know who I am

I can hold the line if I know in the end
That I won't be left behind I don't regret
What I've done I don't think you can blame me
Now I'm standin' all alone out here on my own

I'm not thinking 'bout leavin' home
But I need to be on my own
Doesn't mean I have a heart of stone
I won't even ask them why
I can't ever let them see me cry
Here I'm standing all alone out here on my own...
Out here on my own

Feeling lost in a world full of lies
I can't help thinkin' that love is just
Passin' me by hold on to what I believe
And keep an open hand

Can I have it all if there's no one to
Turn to when I stumble and fall
Is there a secret I need because no one
Has told me - all alone

It may take some time cause I know
How it feels to have a lot on your mind
I'll never feel all alone 'cause I
Know that I have me
Now I can make it all alone out here on my own",On My Own

Torn apart and now I wish that we could make a start
You know I gave you all my love, ow

This world of yours turning upside down
Goin' up and down like a merry-go-round
A rumor goin' on right across the town
Why can't you see it?

I gave you love like you never knew
And you're givin' me nothing but an attitude
And now I'm gonna give a bit of solitude
I'll miss you, baby, oh
Misbehavin' now I'll miss ya

Ow, you're just a party, party, party boy
Yeah, oh baby
You're just a party, party, party boy

Gotta look around or you'll lose your friends
Am I gettin' through?

You got a plastic girl in a plastic bed
And she's in your house made of gingerbread
And you're in there too

But what can you do-do-do?

But reality you don't disregard
You know that it's true
You got a plastic goal in a plastic life
Gotta search your soul gotta make it right
And here's what you do-do-do

Alanis Morissette,"Standing there on a road that leads to anywhere
Like a child left in the wilderness, standing there penniless
Wanting to be the best

Here's a place where life runs at a different pace
Where love is just convenient, none are obedient
And we are subservient

Look at me, I'm a girl that some may preconceive
Why do they try and generalize, why are they antagonizing me
But something I can't control that...

CHORUS:
I WANTCHA
You know I'll never stop 'til I've GOTCHA
You'll never be quite the same when I ROCK YA
I'm not the kind of girl that you thought I was
You'll have a good time 'cause I WANTCHA
I'm breaking down the walls 'till I have you, feel you
Show you the time of your life

Here we are and I wonder how we've come this far
In a world that does not recognize women are victimized
What does that symbolize

Why do I want the things I usually criticize
It may be self destructiveness, or maybe it's emptiness inside
But something I can't control that...

CHORUS

You'll have a good time...
It's a lonely road, and no one knows the way that I feel
I'm not giving up now... I'll never try to justify
They'll never understand, you'll be a happy man
You'll have the time of your life

It's something, it's something, it's something that I can't control
The time of your life...

Now that I'm a zillionaire

Alanis Morissette,"Are you still mad I kicked you out of bed?
Are you still mad I gave you ultimatums?
Are you still mad I compared you to all
My forty year old male friends?
Are you still mad I shared our problems
With everybody?

Are you still mad I had an emotional affair?
Are you still mad I tried to mold you into
Who I wanted you to be?
Are you still mad I didn't trust your intentions?
Of course you are
Of course you are

Are you still mad that I flirted wildly?
Are you still mad I had a tendency to mother you?
Are you still mad that I had one foot out of the door?
Are you still mad that we slept together even after
We had ended it?
Of course you are
Of course you are

Are you still mad I wore the pants most of the time?
Are you still mad that I seemed to focus
Only on your potential?
Are you still mad that I threw in the towel?
Are you still mad that I gave up long before you did?
Of course you are
Of course you are",Are You Still Mad
Alanis Morissette,"I've seen them kneel
With baited breath for the ritual
I've watched this experience raise
Them to pseudo higher levels
I've watched them leave their families
In pursuit of your nirvana
I've seen them coming to line up from Switzerland and America

How long will this take baba
How long have we been sleeping
Do you see me hanging on to every word you say
How soon will I be holy
How much will this cost guru
How much longer 'til you completely absolve me

I've seen them give their drugs up
In place of makeshift altars
I've heard them chanting
Kali kali frantically
I've heard them rotely repeatly your
Teaching with elitism
I've seen them boasting robes and
Foreign sandalwood beads

How long will this take baba
How long have we been sleeping
Do you see me hanging on to every word you say
How soon will I be holy
How much will this cost guru
How much longer 'til you completely absolve me

I've seen them overlooking god in
Their own essence
I've seen their upward glances
In hopes of instant salvation
I've seen their righteousness
Mixed without loving compassion
I've watched you smile as
The student bow to kiss your feet

How long will this take baba
How long have we been sleeping
Do you see me hanging on to every word you say
How soon will I be holy

How would I explain this to my children
If I had them?

Because I can't not
Because I can't not
Because I can't afford
To be misread one more time

Would I be whining if I said I needed a hug?
Would you feel slighted

Because I can't help wonder why you ask me

To all the unheard wisdom in the schoolyard
You think you're the right ones
You think you're the charmed ones I'm sure
How can you go on with such conviction?
And who do you think you are
Why do you question me?

Because we can't not
Because we can't not
Because we can't help

Alanis Morissette,"You hadn't seen your father in such a long time
He died in the arms of his lover how dare he
Your mother never left the house
She never married anyone else you took it upon yourself to console her

You reminded her so much of your father
So you were banished and you wonder why you're so hypersensitive
And why you can't trust anyone but us
But then how can I begin to forgive her so many years under bridges with dirty water
She was foolish and selfish and cowardly if you ask me

I don't know where to begin in all of my 50 odd years
I have been silently suffering and adapting perpetuating and enduring
Who are you younger generation to tell me that I have unresolved problems
Not many examples of fruits of this type of excruciating labor

How can you just throw words around like grieve and heal and mourn
I feel fine we may not have been born as awake as you were
It was much harder in those days we had paper routes uphill both ways
We went from school to a job to a wife to instant parenthood

I walked into his office I felt so self-conscious on the couch
He was sitting down across from me he was writing down his hypothesis I don't know
I've got a loving supportive wife who doesn't know how involved she should get
You say his interjecting was him just calling me on my shit?

Just the other day my sweet daughter I was driving past 203 I walked up the stars in my minds eyes
I remember how they would creak loudly
She was only responsive with a drink he was only responsive by photo
I was only trying to be the best big brother I could

I've walked sometimes confused sometimes ready to crack open wide
Sometimes indignant sometimes raw
Can you imagine I pay him 75 dollars an hour sometimes
It feels like highway robbery
And sometimes it's peanuts
I wish it could last a couple more hours

So here we both are battling similar demons (not coincidentally)
You see in getting beyond knowing it solely intellectually you're not relinquishing your majestry
You are wise you are warm you are courageous you are big
And I love you more now than I ever have in my whole life",The Couch
Alanis Morissette,"(I know he's blood but you can still turn him away you
Don't owe him anything)

Do you go to the dungeon?
To find out how to make peace with your days in the dungeon
Writing a letter to you didn't make me feel any more peaceful than how I felt when we weren't speaking
Because I didn't cop to what I did
I can't love you because we're supposed to have professional boundaries.
I'd like you to be schooled and in awe
As though you were kissed by god full on the lips

[Chorus]
I'm in the front row
The front row with popcorn
I get to see you
See you, close up

(I'm too tired to recount the
Unpleasantries one by one
Minute I want to banish you
The next I want to be on
A deserted island with you along with my three favorite CDs
Ambivalent yet in your
Bed we've yet to acknowledge what really happened)

Slid into the ditch
I have this overwhelming loss of ambition
We said let's name thirty good reasons
Why we shouldn't be together
I started by saying things like ""you smoke"" ""you live in new jersey""
You started saying things like ""you belong to the world""
All of which could have been easily refuted
But the conversation was hypothetical
I am totally short of breath for you
Why can't you shut your stuff off

[Chorus]

(and I laughed until my lungs hurt
I love how you bust my chops
You don't always feel seen sometimes you feel erasable
Unfortunately I cannot reciprocate in my current state
I think we should be careful of how much time we spend together)

For a while while I'm speaking
To you know how much you hate to be interrupted, maybe spend some time alone
Fill up your proverbial cup so that it doesn't always have to be about you
I've been wanting your undivided attention
I like the fact that you're nothing like me
Are you not burdened by the lack of perspective people have of your charmed life seemingly

[Chorus]

(you never meant to be ungrateful
Nor held up to be whipped or wept for certainly not analyzed
Prodded at more ways than one
Apparently you've been misrepresented
Dealing with the concept of arrows being
Slung towards your outrageous fortune)

Hey I'm not mad at you guardian
I'm mad at myself for spending so much time with you and your Jekyll and Hydeness
I'm glad I figuratively slapped you on the wrist
You laughed a wicked laugh and said ""come here let me clip your wings!""
(I know he's blood but you can still turn him away you
Don't owe him anything)
""raise the roof"" he yelled ""yeah raise the roof!"" I yelled back
(unfortunately you needed a health scare to reprioritize.)
No thanks to the soap box
Having me rile against them
Won't make an ounce of difference

[Chorus]

(oh the things I've done for you
Many a stitch a friend
A man's been left for you
Oh the books I've read for you
The tongues I've bitten for you
Many a new city for you
Many a risk taken for you
Not a single regret)",Front Row
Alanis Morissette,"You are the original template 
You are the original exemplary 
How seen were you actually? 
How revered were you (honestly) at the time? 

Why pleased with your low maintenance?

Where was your ally your partner in feminine crime? 

Oh mother who'd your buddy? 
Oh mother who'd got your back?

Alanis Morissette,"As we were talking outside,
It was cold,
We were shivering, yet warmed by the subject matter.

My wife is in the next room,
We've been having troubles you know,
Please don't tell her or anyone,
But I need to talk to somebody.

You said, wouldn't it be a shame if I knew how great I was
Five minutes before I died? Id be filled with such regret
Before I took my last breath.
And I said, you're willing to tell me this now, and you're not going to die
Anytime soon.
And I said I haven't been eating chicken,
Or meat,
Or anything.

And you said yes, but you've been wearing leather and laughed and said
Were at the top of the food chain.
And yes you're still a fine woman,
And I cringed.

I was hoping,
I was hoping we could heal each other.
I was hoping,
I was hoping we could be raw together.

We left the restaurant where the head waiter (in his 60s), said
good bye, sir. thank you for your business sir. you're successful and
Established, sir, and we like the frequency with which you dine here sir. and
Your money.
And when I walked by, they said thank you too dear.
I was all pigtails and cords.
And there was a day when I would've said something like,
hey dude, I could buy and sell this place, so kiss it.
I too once thought I was owed something.

I was hoping,
I was hoping we could challenge each other.
I was hoping,
I was hoping we could crack each other up.

I too thought that when proved wrong, I lost somehow.
I too thought life was cruel.
Its a cycle, really.
You think I'm withdrawing and guilt tripping you.
I think you're insensitive and I don't feel heard.

And I said do you believe we are fundamentally judgmental?
Fundamentally evil?
And you said yes.
And I said do you believe in revenge, in right or wrong, good or bad?
And you said well, what about the man that I saw handcuffed in the emergency
Room,
Bleeding after beating his kid, and she threw a shoe at his head.
I think what he did was wrong, and I wouldn't have had a hard time feeling
Compassion for him.
I had to watch my tone for fear of having you feel judged.

I was hoping we could dance together.
I was hoping,
I was hoping we could be creamy together.",I Was Hoping
Alanis Morissette,"Dear darling,
Your mom, my friend
Left a message on my machine
She was frantic
Saying you were talking crazy.

That you wanted to do away with yourself.

And yes, they're in shock
They are panicked

If we were our culture,
If we were our leaders,
If we were our denials,

I remember vividly a day years ago,
We were camping.
You knew more than you thought you should know.
You said I don't want ever to be brainwashed
And you were mind boggling, you were intense.
You were uncomfortable in your own skin.
You were thirsty,
But mostly you were beautiful.

If we were our name tags,
If we were our rejections,
If we were our outcomes,
Id be joining you.

If we were our indignities,
If we were our successes,
If we were our emotions,
Id be joining you.

You and I, were like four year olds.
We want to know why, and how come about everything.
We want to reveal ourselves at will, and speak our minds.
And never talk small talk and be intuitive,
And question mightily, and find God my tortured beacon.

We need to find like-minded companions.

If we were their condemnations,
If we were their projections,
If we were our paranoia's, Id be joining you.

If we were our incomes,
If we were our obsessions,
If we were our afflictions, Id be joining you.

We need a really good memory.

Backyard on a Sunday afternoon when I have the house to
Myself and I'm not expending all that energy on fighting with
My boyfriend 
Is he the one that I will marry? why is it so hard to be
Objective about myself? why do I feel cellularly alone? am I
Supposed to live in this crazy city? can blindly continued fear-
Induced regurgitated life-denying tradition be overcome? 
Where does the money go that I send to those in need? if we
Have so much why do some people have nothing still? why do I
Feel frantic when I first wake up in the morning? why do you
Say you are spiritual yet you treat people like shit? 
How can you say you're close to god and yet you talk behind
My back as though I am not a part of you? why do I say I'm fine
When it's obvious I'm not? why's it so hard to tell you
What I want? why can't you just read my mind? 
Why do I fear that the quieter I am the less you will listen?
Why do I care whether you like me or not? why is it so hard
For me to be angry? why is it such work to stay conscious and
So easy to get stuck and not the other way around?

Whom I am a student and a master? why am I encouraged to
Shut my mouth when it gets too close to home? why cannot I

To beg the club of boys to let us in

You and me estranged from the mother
You and me have felt impotent in our skin
You and me have taken it out on each other
You and me disloyal to the feminine

Such a pity to disavow each other with how far we've come
With how strong we've been

You and me are on this pendulum together
You and me with scarcity still fueling

Sister blister we fight to please the brothers
We think their acceptance is how we win
They're happy we're climbing over each other
To beg the club of boys to let us in

We may not have priorities same
We may not even like each other
We may not be hugely anti-men
But such a cost to dishonor a sister

You and me have made it harder for the other
We forget how hard separatism has been
You and me we can help change their minds together
You and me in alignment until the end

Sister blister we fight to please the brothers
We think their acceptance is how we win
They're happy we're climbing over each other
To beg the club of boys to let us in",Sister Blister [*]
Alanis Morissette,"For hearing all my doubts so selectively and
For continuing my numbing relentlessly
For helping you and myself, not even considering
For beating myself up and over-functioning

To whom do I owe the biggest apology?
No one's been crueler than I've been to me

For letting you decide if I indeed was desirable
For myself love being so embarrassingly conditional
And for denying myself to somehow make us compatible
And for trying to fit a rectangle into a ball

And
To whom do I owe the biggest apology?
No one's been crueler than I've been to me

I'm sorry to myself
My apologies begin here before everybody else
I'm sorry to myself
For treating me worse than I would anybody else

For blaming myself for your unhappiness
And for my impatience when I was perfect where I was
Ignoring all the signs that I was not ready
And expecting myself to be where you wanted me to be

To whom do I owe the first apology?
No one's been crueler than I've been to me

And
I'm sorry to myself
My apologies begin here before everybody else
I'm sorry to myself
For treating me worse than I would anybody else

Well, I wonder which crime is the biggest?
Forgetting you or forgetting myself
Had I heeded the wisdom of the latter
I would've naturally loved the former

For ignoring you: my highest voices
For smiling when my strife was all too obvious
For being so disassociated from my body
And for not letting go when it would've been the kindest thing

To whom do I owe the biggest apology?
No one's been crueler than I've been to me

And
I'm sorry to myself
My apologies begin here before everybody else

With tendencies for conversations that raise bars
You are a sage who is fueled by compassion
Comes to nooks and crannies, is bound for all stars

You make the knees of my bees weak

You are a spirit that knows of no limit
That knows of no ceiling who baulks at dead-ends
You are a wordsmith who cares for his brothers
Not seduced by illusions of fair-weather friends

You make the knees of my bees weak, tremble and buckle
You make the knees of my bees weak

You are a vision who lives by the signals of
Stomach and intuition as your guide
You are a sliver of god on a platter
Who walks what he talks and who cops when he's lied

I see the greener grass
Every time you run for cover
I see this pasture
Every time we're in a funk

Every time we're in a rut
This distant grandeur

My tendency to want to do away feels natural
My urgency to dream of softer places feels understandable

The only way out is through
The faster we're in the better
The only way out is through ultimately
The only way out is through
The only way we'll feel better
The only way out is through ultimately

Every time that I'm confused
I think there must be easier ways
Every time our horns are locked on toweling-throwing
Every time we're at a loss, we've bolted from difficulty
Anytime we're still made of final bowing

My tendency to want to hide away feels easier and
The tendency is picturing another place comforting to go

[Chorus]

We could just walk away and hide our hands in the sand
We could just call it quits, only to start over again
With somebody else

Every time we're stuck in struggle, I'm down for the count that down
Every time I dream of quick fix I'm swaged
Now I know it's hard when it's through
And I'm damned if I don't know quick fix way

Alanis Morissette,"Do I stress you out?
My sweater is on backwards and inside out
And you say, how appropriate
I don't like to dissect everything today
I don't mean to pick you apart you see
But I can't help it

And there I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off
Slap me with a splintered ruler
And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already
If only I could hunt the hunter

And all I really want is some patience
A way to calm the angry voice
And all I really want is deliverance, ah

Do I wear you out?
You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung out
I'm consumed by the chill of solitary
I'm like Estella
I like to reel it in and then spit it out
I'm frustrated by your apathy

And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land
If only I could meet the maker
And I am fascinated by the spiritual man
I am humbled by his humble nature, yeah

And what I wouldn't give to find a soul mate?
Someone else to catch this drift
And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred? Ah

Enough about me, let's talk about you for a minute
Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while
The conflicts, the craziness and the sound of pretenses is falling
All around, all around

Why are you so petrified of silence?
Here can you handle this?
Did you think about your bills, you ex, your deadlines
Or when you think you're going to die?
Or did you long for the next distraction?

And all I need now is intellectual intercourse
A soul to dig the hole much deeper
And I have no concept of time other than it is flying
If only I could kill the killer

And all I really want is some peace man
A place to find a common ground
And all I really want is a wavelength, ah
And all I really want is some comfort
A way to get my hands untied
And all I really want is some justice, ah

It's all I really want, some patience
A way to calm me down
And all I really want is deliverance
A place to find a common ground",All I Really Want [Acoustic Version]
Alanis Morissette,"I had no choice but to hear you
You stated your case time and again
I thought about it

You treat me like I'm a princess
I'm not used to liking that
You ask how my day was

You've already won me over in spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault

Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole
You're so much braver than I gave you credit for
That's not lip service

You've already won me over in spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault

You are the bearer of unconditional things
You held your breath and the door for me
Thanks for your patience

You're the best listener that I've ever met
You're my best friend
Best friend with benefits
What took me so long

I've never felt this healthy before
I've never wanted something rational
I am aware now
I am aware now

You've already won me over in spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault

You've already won me over in spite of me

Alanis Morissette,"What's the matter Mary Jane, you had a hard day
As you place the don't disturb sign on the door
You lost your place in line again, what a pity
You never seem to want to dance anymore

It's a long way down
On this roller coaster
The last chance streetcar
Went off the track
And you're on it

I hear you're counting sheep again, Mary Jane
What's the point of trying to dream anymore
I hear you're losing weight again, Mary Jane
Do you ever wonder who you're losing it for

Well it's full speed baby
In the wrong direction
There's a few more bruises
If that's the way
You insist on heading

Please be honest Mary Jane
Are you happy
Please don't censor your tears

You're the sweet crusader
And you're on your way
You're the last great innocent
And that's why I love you

So take this moment Mary Jane and be selfish
Worry not about the cars that go by
'Cause all that matters Mary Jane is your freedom
So keep warm my dear, keep dry

Alanis Morissette,"Oh, oh, oh

I, recommend getting your heart trampled on to anyone, yeah
I, recommend walking around naked in your living room, yeah

It feels so good (swimming in your stomach)
Wait until the dust settles

You live you learn, you love you learn
You cry you learn, you lose you learn
You bleed you learn, you scream you learn

I certainly do
I, recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at any time

Hold it up (to the rays)

Alanis Morissette,"I want you to know, that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both

An older version of me
Is she perverted like me
Would she go down with you to the theater
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother

'Cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able
To make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, till you died
But you're still alive

And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
Are you thinking of me when you're with her?

'Cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able
To make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, till you died

'Cause the joke that you laid on the bed that was me
And I'm not gonna fade
As soon as you close your eyes and you know it
And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back
I hope you feel it well can you feel it

And, I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me

Alanis Morissette,"How to stay paralyzed by fear of abandonment
How to defer to men in solvable predicaments 
How to control someone to be a carbon copy of you
How to have that not work and have them run away from you

How to keep people at arms-length and never get too close
How to mistrust the ones you supposedly love the most
How to pretend you're fine and don't need help from anyone
How to feel worthless unless you're serving or helping someone

[Chorus]
I'll teach you all this in 8 easy steps
In the course of a lifetime, you'll never forget
I'll show you how to in 8 easy steps
I'll show you how leadership looks when taught by the best

How to hate women when you're supposed to be a feminist
How to play all biased when you're really a hypocrite
How to hate God when you're a prayer and a spiritualist
How to sabotage your fantasies by fear of success

[Chorus]

I've been doing research for years
I've been practicing my ass off
I've been training my whole life for this moment, I swear to you
Culminating just to be this well-versed leader before you

How to lie to yourself and thereby to everyone else
How to keep smiling when you're thinking of killing yourself
How to know them all too well to avoid going within
How to stay stuck in your life blaming them for everything

That what he goes there for, is to unlock the door.

Then maybe, then maybe, then maybe, then maybe

With how strong we've been

We may not be hugely anti-men

I grow from a special seed
I sprinkle it with sensibility
From French and Hungarian snow
I linger in the sprouting
Until my engine's full

Then I move across the sea
To European bliss
To language of poets
As I cut the cord of home
I kiss my mother's mother
Look to the horizon

Wide eyed, new ground
Humbled by my new surroundings

I am a citizen of the planet

My frontier is on an airplane
My prisons, homes for rehabilitating

Then I fly back to my rest
I fly back with my nuclear
But everything is different
So I wait
My yearn for home is broadened
Patriotism expanded
By callings from beyond

So I pack my things
Nothing precious
All things sacred

I am a citizen of the planet
My laws are all of attraction
My punishments are consequences
Separating from source the original sin

I am a citizen of the planet
Democracy's kids are sovereign
Where the teachers are the sages
And pedestals filled with every parent

And so the next few years are blurry
The next decade's a flurry
Of smells and tastes unknown
Threads sewn straight through this fabric
Through fields of every color
One culture to another

And I come alive
And I get giddy
And I am taken and globally naturalized

I am a citizen of the planet
From simple roots through high vision
I am guarded by the angels
And my body guides the direction I go in

I am a citizen of the planet
My favorite pastime edge stretching
Begotten with human condition
These ideals are born from my deepest within",Citizen of the Planet
