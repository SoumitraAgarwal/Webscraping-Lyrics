Sin Bandera,"Una última vez de tu piel en mi piel 
Una última vez que me quieras querer 
Una última vez nuestro amor

Olvidar es un error, cuando lo tuvimos todo
Aún nos queda lo mejor por caminar
No abandones, esta vez voy hacerlo diferente
Démonos de nuevo una oportunidad

Tenemos de plazo hasta el amanecer
úLtima llamada no pierdas la fe

Una última vez de tu piel en mi piel 
Una última vez que me quieras querer 
Una última vez nuestro amor

Una última vez que estás donde estás
Quiero hacerte sentir que me marcho jamás
Una última vez, por favor, se lo debo a mi corazón

Si mañana al despertar, no sentimos que haya nada
Ya no insistiré si no te pude convencer, ésta última vez

Una última vez de tu piel en mi piel 
Una última vez que me quieras querer
Una última vez nuestro amor

Una última vez que estás donde estás
Quiero hacerte sentir que me marcho jamás 
Una última vez, por favor, se lo debo a mi corazón
Que siente que debo pedírtelo de frente
Tenemos de plazo hasta el amanecer
úLtima llamada no pierdas la fe

Una última vez de tu piel en mi piel 
Una última vez que me quieras querer 
Una última vez nuestro amor

Una última vez que estás donde estás
Quiero hacerte sentir que me marcho jamás
Una última vez, por favor, se lo debo a mi corazón",Una Última Vez
Sin Bandera,"Cuando pienso en ti junto a mi 
En todas las cosas que me has hecho sentir 
Y yo te amo y
Si recuerdo tu respirar tu boca 
En silencio siempre me hace pensar que yo te amo 
Siempre con la fuerza de un mar 
Este amor inmenso que me vuelve a golpear 
Vuelve tu piel a brillar 
Vuelven esas manos a hacerme temblar 
Y más te amo 
Oigo tu voz otra vez 
Como un eco que pone todo al revés 

Y más te amo 

Cuando yo recuerdo el latir de tu corazón 
Que siempre me hace seguir 
Yo, yo te amo 
Quise ser tu luz al amanecer 
Y decir de nuevo al anochecer que yo te amo 
Siempre con la fuerza de un mar 
Este amor inmenso que me vuelve a golpear 
Vuelve tu piel a brillar 
Vuelven esas manos a hacerme temblar 
Y más te amo 
Oigo tu voz otra vez 
Como un eco que pone todo al revés 

Y más te amo 

Siempre con la fuerza de un mar 
Este amor inmenso que me vuelve a golpear 
Vuelve tu piel a brillar 
Vuelven esas manos a hacerme temblar 
Y más te amo 
Oigo tu voz otra vez 
Como un eco que pone todo al revés 
Y más te amo 
Y tu no estas",Y Más Te Amo
Sin Bandera,"Buenas noches, mucho gusto
Eras una chica mas
Después de cinco minutos
Ya eras alguien especial
Sin hablarme, sin tocarme
Algo dentro se encendió
En tus ojos se hacía tarde
Y me olvidaba del reloj

Estos días a tu lado
Me enseñaron que en verdad
No hay tiempo determinado
Para comenzar a amar
Siento algo tan profundo
Que no tiene explicación
No hay razón ni lógica en mi corazón

Entra en mi vida
Te abro la puerta
Se que en tus brazos ya no habrá noches desiertas
Entra en mi vida
Yo te lo ruego
Te comencé por extrañar
Pero empecé a necesitarte luego

Woah 

Buenas noches, mucho gusto
Ya no existe nadie más
Después de este tiempo juntos
No puedo volver atrás
Tú me hablaste, me tocaste
Y te volviste mi ilusión
Quiero que seas dueña de mi corazón

Entra en mi vida
Te abro la puerta
Se que en tus brazos ya no habrá noches desiertas, no
Entra en mi vida
Yo te lo ruego
Te comencé por extrañar
Pero empecé a necesitarte luego

Entra en mis horas
Sálvame ahora
Abre tus brazos fuerte
Y déjame entrar

Entra en mi vida
Te abro la puerta
Se que en tus brazos ya no habrá noches desiertas (no más noches desiertas)
Entra en mi vida
Yo te lo ruego
Te comencé por extrañar
Pero empecé a necesitarte luego

Te comencé por extrañar
Pero empecé a necesitarte luego

Oh 
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Ouh","Entra En Mi Vida [Primera Fila Acústico ""Una Última Vez-Encore""]"
Sin Bandera,"Que te quedarás conmigo una vida entera
Que contigo adios invierno solo primavera
Que las olas son de magia y no de agua salada
Yo te creo todo y tú no me das nada
Tú no me das nada

Que si sigo tu camino llegaré hasta el cielo
Tú me mientes en la cara y yo me vuelve ciego
Yo me trago tus palabras tu juegas un juego
Y me brilla el mundo cuando dices luego
Cuando dices luego

Cuando dices siento siento que eres todo
Cuando dices vida yo estaré contigo
Tomas de mi mano y por dentro lloro
Aunque sea mentira me haces sentir vivo
Aunque es falso el aire yo siento que respiro

Mientes tan bien
Que me sabe a verdad
Todo lo que me das
Y ya te estoy amando
Mientes tan bien
Que he llegado a imaginar
Que mi amor llenas tu piel
Y aunque todo es de papel
Mientes tan bien

Cuando dices siento siento que eres todo
Cuando dices vida yo estaré contigo
Tomas de mi mano y por dentro lloro
Aunque sea mentira me haces sentir vivo
Aunque es falso el aire siento que respiro

Mientes tan bien
Que me sabe a verdad
Todo lo que me das
Y ya te estoy amando
Mientes tan bien
Que he llegado a imaginar

Mientes tan bien

Y aunque todo es de papel
Mientes tan bien
Y aunque todo es de papel
Mientes lo se","Mientes Tan Bien [Primera Fila Acústico ""Una Última Vez-Encore""]"
Sin Bandera,"Tal vez atado 
De la cabeza a los pies 

Sin saber si es de noche 
O de día 

Tal vez cayendo en un 
Abismo que inventé 

Sin saber si vivo 
O si moría 

Gracias a ti tengo hoy tengo otra oportunidad, por suerte sabes perdonar 

Yo no quiero saber

¿Qué pasaría si te vas? 
¿Qué pasaría si no estás? 
Darme cuenta que he perdido todo, y sin ti ya no poder sanar de ningún modo 

Qué pasaría sin tu amor? 
Qué pasaría sin tu voz? 
Olvidarme de los más preciado, esquiaré mi futuro viviendo en el pasado 
Qué pasaría? Si no estás

Tal vez me vio viviendo solo en un hotel 
Sabiendo que no volvería 

Buscando quien llenará 
Eso que se fue 
Sabiendo que no se podía 

Gracias a ti tengo hoy tengo otra oportunidad, por suerte sabes perdonar 

Yo no quiero saber 

¿Qué pasaría si te vas? 
¿Qué pasaría si no estas? 
Darme cuenta que he perdido todo, y sin ti ya no poder sanar de ningun modo 

¿Qué pasaría sin tu amor? 
¿Qué pasaría sin tu voz? 
Olvidarme de los más preciado, esquiaré mi futuro viviendo en el pasado 
¿Qué pasaría? 
Si no estás
¿Qué pasaría? 
Si te vas

¿Qué pasaría? 
Si no estás",Qué Pasaría? [En Vivo]
Sin Bandera,"Aún ni siquiera te tengo
Y ya tengo miedo de perderte, amor
Que rápido se me ha clavado
Que dentro todo este dolor.

Es poco lo que te conozco
Y ya pongo todo el juego a tu favor
No tengo miedo de apostarte,
Perderte sí me da pavor.

No me queda mas refugio, que la fantasía
No me queda más que hacer
Que hacerte una poesía.

Por que te vi venir y no dude
Te vi llegar y te abrasé
Y puse toda mi pasión para que te quedaras
Y luego te besé y me arriesgue con la verdad
Te acaricié y al fin abrí mi corazón para que tu pasaras.

Mi amor te di sin condición para que te quedaras.

Ahora esperaré algunos días para ver si lo que te di fue suficiente
No sabes que terror se siente
La espera cada madrugada
Si tu ya no quisieras volver
Se perdería el sentido del amor por siempre
No entendería ya este mundo
Me alejaría de la gente.

No me queda mas refugio, que la fantasía
No me queda más que hacer
Que hacerte una poesía.

Por que te vi venir y no dude
Te vi llegar y te abrasé
Y puse toda mi pasión para que te quedaras
Y luego te besé y me arriesgue con la verdad
Te acaricié y al fin abrí mi corazón para que tu pasaras.

Mi amor te di sin condición para que te quedaras.
Mi amor te di sin condición para que te quedaras.
Mi amor te di sin condición para que te quedaras.","Te Vi Venir [Primera Fila Acústico ""Una Última Vez-Encore""]"
Sinai Beach,"Now, what's this? 
That can't be the girl that I once knew. 
Did your eyes fool your heart, 
Or did your heart fool your beliefs? 

Now I watch you eat your words. 
Please tell me that it's not the girl that I once knew. 
The promise was made to always hold true; 
But you said, ""I'll never."" 

Well I guess that old saying is true, 
""Never say never."" 
You take steps back in your faith, 
Just to get the kiss of a pretty face. 

Never say never. 
Now I watch you eat your words, 
How did they taste? 
Now knowing you has become ironic. 

A woman so wonderful, a face so beautiful. 
But I hate to look upon it, 
Because it reminds me of what once was, 
What was once you. 

That can't be the girl I once knew. 
A woman so wonderful, 
A face so beautiful, 
I pray you'll be her again.",Never Say Never
Sinai Beach,"[Instrumental]




",Distressor
Sinai Beach,"Never before tonight did I think I could kill a man
And sink a knife deep into skin,
But I could kill you.
Surely I could wreck you,
Because you wrecked them.
You rapists, you abusers,
You thieves, you murderers.
I've taken my look around
And all I've seen leads me to believe
That if I was God,
Heaven would be nearly empty
And Hell would be overflowing.

So thank God that I'm not God,
And praise Him for being nothing like me.
I would have forsaken man.
So praise Him for being nothing like me,
'Cause I would have let this world burn.

If I was God, I would do unto you things unthinkable,
Far beyond cruel and unusual.

So thank God that I'm not God,
And praise Him for being nothing like me.
I would have forsaken man.
So praise Him for being nothing like me.

For those who ask,
He gives His grace kindly.
His forgiveness is beyond me.
I would have let this world burn.
And even to the most perverted man,
And even to the most wretched man,
His glory and mercy is given.",The God I Would Be
Sinai Beach,"Best run. They come from all directions
For your identity, for your freedom,
To give the Mark of the Beast.
Rebel. They don't come in peace.
Believe, profess, and lose your head in the process,
Or bear the Mark and be theirs to possess.

I believe in the prophecies.
The future will bring tribulation.
The future will bring revelation.
I believe in the prophecies.

Revolt.
I will not bow to Antichrist.
Revolt.

I believe in the prophecies.
This is what is to come.
I pray I will not live to see what is to be.
For strength I also pray, if I do see such days.
Revolt.",Hell Blaze
Sinai Beach,"Hell is all around me, or at least it seems to be.
I look to the side of me – emptiness.
I look to the other – suffering and loneliness.
I wonder, can it get any worse?
And all of this reminds me of man's gift turned curse:
Free will given to man by God,
For He longs to be loved by those who choose.
For with free will comes real love, real hate,
And the freedom to not be robotically used.

Dark days of the Human Race.
I tried to see man's beauty,
But chaos reigns in his chosen way.
My friends welcome to man's stage.

Man is chaos. Man is insanity.
What's stopping anyone from mutilating me?
Fear is the basis of society,
Invoked merely by the hand that is punishing.
Man is his so-called master,
And it turned him into a monster.
Man is his so-called master,
And it turned him into a disaster. Disaster.

Dark days of the Human Race.
I tried to see man's beauty,
But chaos reigns in his chosen way.
My friends welcome to man's stage.",His Chosen Fate
Sinai Beach,"Do you think you're the only one who hates?
The only one bound to humanistic restraints?
Well my belief doesn't make me a saint.

Through these veins, blood still flows.
So trust me when I say you're not alone.
Just alone in your pity.
At times, all I see is red,
And all I want is bloodshed.
I desire nothing more 
Than feeding my thoughts what they crave for.
I can feel evil too,
But I refuse, I refuse to let what haunts my mind
Destroy the reason this creation was designed.
Although my eyes are still set on the Divine,
I am still a member of Mankind.

But I refuse, I refuse to let what haunts my mind

Although my eyes are still set on the Divine,
I am still a member of Mankind.

I will not grovel at your ability to wallow your love,
For sorrow I will not follow.",Ignoring the Conditional Response
Sinai Beach,"Lord, what more than little good has Your death done
Lord, why did you give Your Son
Surely You did it for more than this

The world lives on in ignorance, filth, and arrogance
Man wreaks havoc on his inheritance
Man wreaks havoc on his inheritance

Surely You gave Your life
Surely You gave Your blood (Blood)
And Your flesh for more than this
Surely You gave Your life
Surely You gave Your blood (Blood)
And Your flesh for more than this

Lord, what more than little good has Your death done
Lord, why did you give Your Son
Surely You did it for more than this

Your covenant lies highly rejected
Sadly, it is seldomly accepted
Yes, just to me it means everything
But to most it means nothing

Surely You gave Your life
Surely You gave Your blood (Blood)
And Your flesh for more than this
Surely You gave Your life
Surely You gave Your blood (Blood)
And Your flesh for more than this
Surely You died for more than this

The reason is I
The reason is one
The reason is I
The reason is one

You'd suffer and die all over again
For one single person
And if that one should choose to reject You
That is the very essence of You
To give the chance to choose",Necessary Bloodshed
Sinai Beach,"God, what has become of me?
What will become of me?
I am just a man.
I am just a wretched mind that belongs to a selfish and busy man,
And the calluses on my hands are proof that I am.
Big complication.
Sum me up in one sad little sentence.
And You're so beautiful and bathed in perfection.
The stars, the Earth, and all that's within,
Put there by Your orchestration.

Cut me and gut me
And hang me by the organs within me.
If that's what You'd like to see,
Then let it be,
'Cause I desire to be pleasing.

What's wrong with militance?
You bled for me,
So I too must be willing to bleed.
I will live for You, then I will die for You.
What's so wrong with diligence?
What's so wrong with militance?

Cut me and gut me,
And hang me by the organs within me.
If that's what You'd like to see,
Then let it be,
'Cause I desire to be pleasing.

I lay naked upon the altar.
Now I bleed for You.",Obedience Through Desecration
Sinai Beach,"I've been fooled.
I'm in hypnosis.
I'm a living lie.
Deceit has control.
I've blinded myself to see what I wanted as something holy,
But now I shed my skin and I strip the flesh.
Sanctification.

I'm being released from a condition 
That sees my will as His decision.
From ash, dirt, and stone
He created the Human Race.
After years of searching amongst them,
I finally found my place.

In desire to rule, I find entrapment.
And in surrender, control.

I'm being released from a condition 
That sees my will as His decision.
From ash, dirt, and stone

After years of searching amongst them,
I finally found my place.

I swallow my pride, though it hurts as it slides down.
The pain will subside, but the call cannot be drowned.
Death to flesh and death to this place.
Freed from care and from disgrace.",Return to Dust
Sinai Beach,"Wait. What's that?
Did I hear you say something?
Maybe this time with substance.
Maybe this time with meaning.
No. The mouth spews forth like a scientific law.
It never fails me like a cat will lick its paw.
There you'll be.
No changing. Never willing.
The drama sticks to you like the smell of perspiration.
A stench will stick to its garbage.

Look into my eyes.
I want to see the definition of a weakling born so long ago.
But still all I see is that of a baby.

Move from your filth.
You've been like this for how long?
And I pray you will prove me wrong.
Move from your filth.
Get some credibility.
Be someone of worth, and say goodbye to this.
Will you stick to your garbage?

Look into my eyes.
I want to see the definition of a weakling born so long ago.
But still all I see is that of a baby.
A stench will stick to its garbage.
Will you stick to yours?



",The Stagnate
Sinai Beach,"As you laugh, someone cries
As you live, somebody dies
One will fall but another will rise
Someone loves, someone hates
And as you ascend into Heaven
Others pass through Hell's gates

And let us not lose compassion
For those who have yet to be pardoned

May we not forget our fellow man
Mourn with those who mourn
And rejoice with the joyous
May we not forget our past
So if grace was ever given
We would be the first to give it
So if grace was ever given
We would be the first to give it

And let us not lose compassion
For those who have yet to be pardoned
And I know, by the grace of God, I roam
And I'll stand before Him naked and alone
And so will we all when death comes to take us home
And so will we all when death comes to take us home

The world is ours to take, so let's take it
If the world is man's, it is what he makes it

And let us not lose compassion
For those who have yet to be pardoned
And I know, by the grace of God, I roam
And I'll stand before Him naked and alone
And so will we all when death comes to take us home
And so will we all when death comes to take us home
And so will we all when death comes to take us home",To the Church
Sinamore,"Monster inside is hiding the crime slowly falling from grace
Nothing new; everything is ""so fine""
Hope you finally forgive me for all my sins that IÂ´ve done
In the throes of passion I make you believe

The broken wings of the angel
I see how it falls through the shadows into the cradle

Once little death came dancing to me smiling behind the gloom
Nothing new everything is ""so fine""
A shadow falls on my grave and the rain is breaking the ground
Once awaken flies into the unknown

Pieces will fall, wither and die
I gave you nothing only bitter shame

Sinamore,"I can see it in your eyes
The pain is growing deep inside
Far so long it breaks your heart

Once more feel the burning flame
Be my light mine through this rain
Keep the demons away

Tears are fading with cold rain
And with love I staunch my pain
Hold me darling in your arms

Burning lust now turns to hate
Be my sunrise of last day
See the love moon rising

I'm falling into your arms eternal sleep
Once more feel the burning flame
Like the crimson leaf
I'm falling into your arms eternal sleep
Once more feel the burning flame
Now it's time for me",Crimson Leaf
Sinamore,"I woke from the shades to fear for you
Cold death on icy ground
A touch of faith face so pale
All that remains looks so frail

The shadow veil I wear to save your soul
I'm the saviour of new day
Across the waves beyond the sea
I'll take you with me Â´til itÂ´s all dead

Sleep little child dreams aren't able to break your spine
In darkness of day our marks they will never find

The silence rises from it's grave
Fear holds me when the darkness takes the thrown
The hope is guiding our way
Our fragile hearts are dying
Forever they are drowning

Face tomorrow without fate
Through the flames of rage we dive",Darkness of Day
Sinamore,"Like center page, I read through your eyes again.
Your love is like a gun.
With your lies, burning way through fire again.

Dark walk I roam, hiding in your shadow as you are
Re-created way of pain, fight against the fears you gave me
You are

Forever loveless kingdom. Your face hurts like a scar.
The pain that you sow make me go too far.
In your dreams heaven is flooded with the sin.
The truth is that I have lost you deep within.

Still in my dreams we both die",Drama for Two
Sinamore,"Walking on the edge all pain within
You are the one no one else to blame
Nothing matters to me now
Create a sound that's so divine I feel your pain

I follow you to the other side
I swept all away from yesterday
Nothing matters to me now
I wake the evil so divine, I feel your pain

On your face I see now only fear
All your life is now in disappear

All my life is now in disappear",Fallen
Sinamore,"All these years IÂ´ve been alone
Yearning for a change to my life
Like abandoned child

I face the voidness of this so called life
With all fears inside

And the time wonÂ´t leave behind any shattered tears
You look into my eyes
The darkness faces the light

I follow my fears, I cry
Empty downhearted soul
For so long in darkness I have dwelled
I follow my fears, I cry
Roaming alone all day",Follow into the Cry
Sinamore,"Every day a mourner's day
Behind these walls of lies
Suicide I still love her

All comes down in crimson rain
The pain is growing inside
I know I still feel for her

Yearning for lost and quiet scenes
Yearning for your light in this time
In time of sorrow

From cradle to grave I'm counting the days
I'll reach the hand of hope
every time I feel hollow

With myself I wallow in pain
Finally sealing the scars on my face
All forever stained by glorious darkness",Misery Carnival
Sinamore,"Give me your hand this round is for my pain
Let it all lay dead and erased, 'cause everything is nothing
The words once said, are dripping down by the dampness in rainfall
that drowns our lives in lies

Crying echoes are calling my name
I'm walking through the field of needles IÂ´m not painless
Drowning deeper into your thoughts
You throw your arms on me so tight
You make me feel alive

Unknown faces in the night
Close your eyes",My Rain
Sinamore,"Waiting for a new day reliving my thoughts alone
At the gates of garden where the joy have never shown
Since I've known

I close my eyes and let your voice lead me tonight
Black painted view I see the river flows your cry

Since I've known I have carried the pain all within
Since I've known my mind have been painted with sin
Since I've known

Waiting for tomorrow frail I need to paint my sorrows away
to find another path into my scars
Waiting for tomorrow frail I need to paint my sorrows away
You bring me the light for my life

I turn off the lights to create the darkness of my own
The evil inside me is growing so strong that I have to let go",A New Day
Sinamore,"In love for hate, lost in greed
The ocean of evil is too deep
Another day will turn into the night

It's so cold in that scene whereÂ´s the angel on her knees
to pray the God for a way into the light

Together we go crawling in lust of pain
In life all is rage we are sleeping away
Blood on our arms; God we bleed again
In truth all seems grey we are dying away

Dreams are broken all have been lies
The story of our life is done and buried in grave
The reason why the angels cry
is all those demons on her side
They cry 'til we are gone

Cold feelin' rain falling down on skin
Tears of our pain breaks the ice so thin
Forever we go reaching to the light
All we would say Aikanaan kaikki kuolemme pois",Sleeping Away

Versteck dich im Dunkeln, du Sohn einer Schwuchtel
Du rappst für 31er, die mal im Knast saßen
Ich für Asylanten, die immer noch kein Pass haben
Auf ihren Pass warten, vorne am Schalter
Auf dem Passbild Aussehen wie Mohammed Atta

Since October,"I'm right here, I'm right here
Please come fall in my arms again
I'll be here to catch you when you do

Never mind all the never ending struggles
They only make me stronger
Every time all the everlasting troubles come
I'm stronger than before

Thank God for disaster, disaster and tears
Thank God for my reasons, my reasons to fear
Every time that I've lost it all and death is calling me
I understand this is what saved my life again

Wake up, wake up
It seems like now I've got nothing left
Can you save me somehow with the rest?

Never mind all the never ending struggles
They only make me stronger
Every time all the everlasting troubles come
I'm stronger than before

Thank God for disaster, disaster and tears
Thank God for my reasons, my reasons to fear
Every time that I've lost it all and death is calling me
I understand this is what saved my life again

Wake up, wake up
I'm right here, I'm right here

Thank God for disaster, disaster and tears
Thank God for my reasons, my reasons to fear
Every time that I've lost it all and death is calling me
I understand this is what saved my life again

Every time you save me somehow
And I finally, I open my eyes
And I, I will never be the same again
I will never be the same again
",Disaster
Since October,"Good luck means nothing to me
So exactly what does that mean
For me now have I given up
On almost everything

My scars are easy to see
Haunting reminders indeed
And they still bleed
For the first time I'm down on my knees

Begging, pleading now
Intercede please show me how

If I could survive, if I was innocent
Would you take the blame for me?
If I could survive, if I was innocent
Would you take the blame for me?

You're asking nothing of me
Just say goodbye and I'm free
It's so easy, I don't understand
But I want it more than anything

Can't seem to begin to release
This guilty conscience for peace
It's so hard till I'm back here
I'm back on my knees

Begging, pleading now
Intercede please show me how

If I could survive, if I was innocent
Would you take the blame for me?
If I could survive, if I was innocent
Would you take the blame for me?

Guilt has got the best of me
I'm holding on to almost nothing
Wondering if innocence
Could ever lead to my forgiveness

If I could survive, if I was innocent
Would you take the blame for me?
If I could survive, if I was innocent
Would you take the blame for me?

Blame for me
Would you take the blame for me? Guilty
Blame for me
Would you take the blame for me? Guilty

Blame for me
Would you take the blame for me? Guilty
Blame for me
Would you take the blame for me?

Comes undone

Exposed and lonely, addiction draws me near
Designed to crush me a six year haze as the substance lets me down
Cause it's not real and that's why
It's how I always want to feel so let's die before the secrets get revealed
I'm falling over from scratches built through time
For timeless mistakes, my memories dissolve and all I know are these scars
And it's not real and that's why
It's how I always want to feel so let's die, before the secrets get revealed
I've tried but nothing can ever appeal and if you don't mind I'd like to throw it all away
Well I've been down that road, the sober soldier
I doubt I'll make it home so get me away from here, before I fall apart
Cause it's easy to do and it feels and it seems true
But it's not real and that's why
Its how I always want to feel so let's die, before the secret gets revealed
I've tried but nothing ever can appeal and if you don't mind I'd like to throw it all away",433 (Hypothetical Situation)
Sinch,"Stained and afraid that this won't ever go away
Engulfed inside a blaze of memories
And the strain of digging holes, is beginning to take it's toll
And I saw this coming, when you started running over my dreams but isn't it funny
It eats at me slowly and I found redemption in suffering
And it's just like you to say, I'd be better off without you anyway
Now I'm stumbling through my words and it's all your fault, so feel guilty
Stained and looking for a way out of this mess
The feelings and the truth are hard to confess
But you've seen the cycle round now I guess you had me figured out
So you watched me suffer, it inched it's way slowly under my skin
But I saw this coming, when you started running
Now it seems sensible to burn the bridge

But on the mattress, I had a good time
I can't remember she wore the same brands as everyone else
That's why I don't mind if she deciphers the lines
Welcome to the despair, this is my trophy room
And fear is on the plate but you can't recognize the anger as it builds beneath the skin
Cause it's fucking mine
But on the mattress, I had a good time
I can't remember, the wore the same brands as everyone else
That's why I don't mind, if she deciphers the lines
I guess it's alright to be scared because fear has a funny way of killing me slowly but
I know you too well, to expect the truth wouldn't fall apart
I might as well lie to myself, on top of my fucking lungs, my fucking lungs
Tear to pieces everything you've ever known bout this world

And by the way, would it be O.K., if we went our separate ways, just to see
I don't want to hide the truth, but I can see you through jaded eyes my faded broken gaze
It strays away, and I am afraid that I'll make mistakes I'll always regret
And by the way, would it be O.K., if we went our separate ways
Cause I can't breathe
Sometimes I think that these chains can be broken
And I can see your eyes, your lying through your teeth and I'm aware, this isn't fair

It tears the soul straight from my spine, but in the end I guess the truth is shown
That you won't ever really be mine
I shuffled through the lies and
Pain I won't let you slip away, no everybody makes mistakes sometimes
So rain on my parade, rain on my parade, rain
I figured it out this time and I guess that's a start
You're only half as smart as the one that tears you apart
Let the evidence show that I never really had a case
I'd like to wipe that smile right off your fucking face

Sinch,"Always feeling so uncomfortable, and the situation tends to be predictable
Hope slips through trained fingers, It's how it's always been
I can't seem to tear myself away, been living in the past with my mistakes
But I always find a way to numb the tension, bury thoughts alone
Under the skin to hide the damage done to my defense
Senses dulled then cracked, I concede that maybe
I'm unsure of just what it takes to frustrate and dismantle apathy
Rain, wash away the temptations before I let them get the best of me
Yesterday's accomplishments, replaced by tomorrow's burdens 
A never ending cycle begins, so diseased and looking for a means to an end
I found nothings solid anymore, all that's left is try and I confess that maybe
I'm unsure of just what it takes to frustrate and dismantle apathy
Rain, wash away the temptations before I let them get the best of me
Designed and developed inside of my lungs, on the tip of my fucking tongue
But no one ever gets the point
That life is always about to fall to pieces, just something beautiful that's about to get wrecked
But no one wants to feel at all
Because we've made ourselves so numb, but I want to feel something
I won't ever live that way again, somewhere along the line I lost feeling
And I lost control, But then I lost strength and completely lost hope
When our lives are consumed by society's fumes,
We punch our time clocks and watch the ignorance bloom
And how strange that we all feel the same, and how strange that no one dares complain
See I'm always turning backwards and forwards again retracing my steps to the bitter cold end
Rewind the tape and let me see exactly where it went wrong, indulge in our pasts strong
And how strange that we all feel the same, and how strange that no one complains
Designed and developed inside of my lungs on the tip of my fucking tongue
But no one ever gets the point

Tell me how long should this last I've been forgetting how to act and
These memories will burn like gasoline
And I believe there's something more cause this isn't what I've been looking for
If I blink my eyes I'm afraid I might miss some of it
This makes no sense a mirage of an oasis but it kills my time
Well try to remember what I sought, I never gave it that much thought
Does it really matter at all, cause there really is no time for opening up my eyes
Cause you know that I have seen it all before
And I believe there's something more cause this isn't what I've been looking for
If I blink my eyes I'm afraid I might miss some of it

Paralyzed you can't breath
Paranoid you can't sleep

Controls my friends
The weather man predicts the end and I forget just why I lay here emotionless
To rise and bleed and die in fall
And I need to push you so far away
Cause I want to do to you what I have always longed to do
Cause it's been so long since we spoke and I keep pushing away but you knew exactly

Alejado en una pieza

Ya vea como se aleja

Otro amanecer despierta
Why otro dia mas why mas comienza
Lleno de culpas padre
Ay perdon

Me siento q volver a empezar
Para mi ya es mui tarde

Como yo me eh kemado

Es un arte ke arde
Debes despertarte
Es ke antes

Ahora estoi aki
En las puertas de la iglesia
Tampoco no lo creo

Lo veo I lo niego

Se apoderan de akel gran dios todo poderoso
Why no lo logro

Ke poco un vinculo YO
Un discipulo
Un angel me toco la vida
Q todos dicen q es mui rica sencilla

Seguiria a todos si no hubiera nada en ke pensar
Tirando todo el juego del azar
Tengo una vida en la mano
Ke para mi todo esto es en vano

Observo a esa gente simplemente
Q copa sus asientos son cientos leyendo
Como ciervos bajo cristo desisto

Perdido estoy
Why como estoi perdido ya no encuentro mi destino
Ser el perdedor de siempre en esta historia

Q ya nada se invierte
Como elegir entre el cielo I el infierno
Lo despierto I me da lo mismo why listo
Mi eleccion tiene un precio

why te desprecio mi dolor
Una herida misma q en mi vida brilla
Como un pecado
Este juego es lo bueno pero luego

Llego lejos why lejo why lejos why lejos why lejos why mas lejos
De lo ke podia creer
Encerrado aki estoi en 4 pared
Estoi oi soi un verdadero pecador
Hoy soi como voi un verdadero pecador

Esclavisado why condenado
La vida es un juicio why yo caido en el vicio

Confesiones
De un pecador sediento ambriento
De esta pesadilla no despierto

Confesiones
De un pecador sediento ambriento
De esta pesadilla no despierto

Descargando mi ira
Tal vez esa es la mia
Ahora todavia no sigo la cima
FREE BOLO

Como todo cuando me encuentro solo
Yo pase siendo un tabaco
Me siento un amargo
Aki estoi atado el rencor
Nunca se hare hacia un costado

Asi kada ves es mas el rocio
Q yakude mis pensamientos
A veces creo estar en esa cumbre
Pero en la casa hasta llegar

Es mas lejos de costumbre nunca sabes
Padre con lo ke tengo con ke tengo
Lo ke siento vacio mi dolor why el delirio
Correr al mas alla es un alivio

Pero a la ves es mi vacio mi dolor
Es como el frio sentimiento
Caes hacia alli why no puedes escapar
De este tormento, sediento, hambriento
De esta pesadilla no despierto

Confesiones
De un pecador sediento hambriento
De esta pesadilla no despierto

De un pecador sediento hambriento
De esta pesadilla no despierto

Pues aparta tus testigos
Que yo soy el jurado
Echando leña al fuego, así

Dejando mis adversarios en el suelo
En mi barrio muero
Como el propio amo a sus esclavos

Aquí apóstoles cargados
De gracias divinas
Represento del micrófono

Puestas al diamante

Aunque tú con el ascensor
Quieres subir más arriva

Escalón por escalón no me trepe
Hace años estoy en la cima
Paliando contra la jauría
Dictamino mi profesia, soy el mesías

Acusan de tener rimas perfectas
Pero no salieron de la meta
A la vez mi poder aumenta
Perfecta la trampa que ami me tienen

Pero más rápido que la luz
Ami nadie me detiene

Apostolados hasta aquí

A predicar la religión

Divagando como dialogando con el diablo

Jugando con aparatos violentos, me atrevo a tu ignorancia

Lamento como siempre por la mala infancia
Elevo mi pensamiento, tomo distancia, mostré
Fragancia y elegancia de un tipo de 36 años medio
Corpulento todavia amparo el viento, contento

Me siento por mi aduques,no pienses que terminaré
Jugando a la ajedrez,vete a veces a mi
Vecindario, nujeres a pilo, sobre el filo
Nuevo flow, nuevo estilo, prende un fino
Mierda baby, te espero, para brindar con un buen vino

Refugiandose en un trago del dolor
Que ha dejado esa ingrata traicionera
Le ha amargado para siempre el corazon
Otro trago cantinero por favor

No hay tiempo para lagrimas
Mis animos unanimes
Invalides por debiles impreciones supersticiones
Que vengo en picada
Soi camicase con portaviones
Asique señores no me jusguen por mi locura

Tengo tenciones y en ocaciones
Quedo en el limbo oscuro el avismo
Tiembla mi cuerpo como un sismo
Magnetismo por la bebida
Mi caida al fracaso llega el ocaso
Y el alcohol puesto en un baso

Abrazo otra prostituta en mi regaso
Se que no tengo garantias, lo savia, mi madre lo decia
No hay lagrimas que borren esta agonia otro dia
Y la resaca que destaca una gris noche nefasta
Subasto mis recuerdos escondidos en aquel carton de vino
Caigo como aquel futuma duro impuro

De mi futuro inseguro
Dejando el cuento en los bares de ser el tipomas rudo
Se que me hundo en cada minuto que pasa en mi casa
Cuenta la historia mas notoria, no me cabe en la memoria
Tanta falsedad en mi ingratitud, el perdonar es mi virtud
Sigo tomando un trago sobre mi ataud

Llevo la cruz
Perdi el sendero, donde quedo mi luz
Asi seguire por siempre
En el camino de la soledad y la amargura
Mal para mi, para ti una aventura
Otro trago cantinero porfavor

Escondo mis recuerdos en un carton de vino
La soledad testigo, lagrimas y olvido
Pierdo los estrivos, muy duro mi camino
Cantinero sirva, amargo mi destino
Escondo mis recuerdos en un carton de vino
Otro trago cantinero porfavor

Contemplando hacia el cielo
Compruebo que en aquella leljana estrella
Se refleja una vacia botella
Camino por la misma huella
Por donde la soledad fue testigo
De lagrimas y olvidos

Pierdo los estrivos
Por lo bebido y la ingrata que se fue
Soi un boemio sin fe
Confeciones de un pecador en el ocaso
He caido en la bebida y el fracaso
Es mi caso

Cantinero quiero una ginebra en mi vaso
Veo cebras y culebras a pocos pasos
La mala vida me ha pegado como un trompaso
Acaso comprenden al pallaso sin cura
No me condenen por mi locura
Aventura baja altura, basura en la mesa

Cubierta de grasa espesa
Este rimador confesa
Tener un dolor incorporado
Soi el mago que ataja
La baraja encaja en buenas pajas, y alcoholizado
Otro trago cantinero porfavor

Escondo mis recuerdos en un carton de vino
La soledad testigo, lagrimas y olvido
Pierdo los estrivos, muy duro mi camino
Cantinero sirva, amargo mi destino
Escondo mis recuerdos en un carton de vino
Otro trago cantinero porfavor

Perdon, no se si es mi ignorancia
O mi problema es la bagancia
Y eso me preocupa un poco
Estoi desaliñado y los problemas me taparon
Soi propenso a mas de un trago
Y si muchos ven a un bago

Es porque estoi hundido como un viejo clavo
Soi pricionero de mis propios miedos
Señor para mi no guardes el cielo
Que tengo pase libre al infierno
Los angeles brindaron
Y los demoños me atraparon

Deje el amor en una esquina
Y esa esquina ya no existe
Vieja cuanta razón tuvistes
El dolor no se guarda en un baso
Pero ya es tarde para hacerte caso
O acaso que el destino puso espinas en mi paso

Que hasta me pierdo como el humo de un tabaco
Porque emigro a tantos lugares inseguros
Que se han temido
Buscando por lo menos una mentira sobre la verdad
O que boltee mi cara y buelva a la realidad
Claro que siempre fiu señalado

Y me cago
Pues combato una batalla con mi mas dulce aliada
Soy un cantante perdido en las esquinas
Perdoname señor si he pactado con mi vida

Solitario y abrumado por la pena
Refugiandose en un trago del dolor
Que ha dejado esa ingrata traicionera
Le ha amargado para siempre el corazon
Otro trago cantinero por favor
Otro trago cantinero por favor

Stolen from our very eyes

You will learn
You will rise
You'll return

I'll die

I will rise

I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched bothered and bewildered
Am I

Lost my heart, but what of it?
He is cold, I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day 
When I'll cling to him,
Bewitched bothered and bewildered
Am I.

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and only show it
Like a babe in arms

I've sinned a lot
I mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen alive
Bewitched bothered and bewildered

Am I
I'll sing to him
Each spring to him
And worship the trousers 

That clink to him
Bewitched bothered and bewildered
Am I

When he talks
He is seeking 
Words to get
On his chest

Harsh until he's speaking 
He's at his very best
Jest again
Oh yes perplexed again

Then cry I can't be oversexed again
Bewitched bothered and bewildered
Am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"
Sinéad O'Connor,"I'm feelin' mighty lonesome,
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch
The door and in between
I drink black coffee
Love's hand me down broom
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room
I'm talkin' to the shadows
One o'clock till four
And lord, how slow
The moments go
When all i do is pour
Black coffee
Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hangin' out on Monday
My Sunday dreams to dry
Now a man is born to go a lovin'
A woman's born to weep and fret
To stay at home and
Tend her over
And drown the past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes!
I'm moanin' all the mornin'
And mournin' all the night
And in between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight

Feelin' low as the ground
It's drivin' me crazy
This waiting for my baby
To maybe come around",Black Coffee

My hours are slumberless,
Dearest the shadows
I live with are numberless

Little white flowers will
Never awaken you
Not where the black coach
Of sorrow has taken you

Angels have no thought of
Ever returning you
Would they be angry
If I thought of joining you
Gloomy sunday.

Sunday is gloomy
With shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have
Decided to end it all

Soon there'll be flowers
And prayers that are sad,
I know, let them not weep,
Let then know
That I'm glad to go

Death is no dream,
For in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my
Soul I'll be blessing you

Dreaming
I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you
Asleep in the deep of

Never haunted you

How much I wanted you

They are illusions
They are not the solutions
They promised to be

Sinéad O'Connor,"Okay, I want to talk about Ireland
Specifically I want to talk about the ""famine""
About the fact that there never really was one
There was no ""famine""
See Irish people were only allowed to eat potatoes
All of the other food
Meat fish vegetables
Were stipped out of the country under armed guard
To England while the Irish people starved
And then on the middle of all this
They gave us money not to teach our children Irish
And so we lost our history
And this is what I think is still hurting me

See we're like a child that's been battered
Has to drive itself out of it's head because it's fightened
Still feels all the painful feelings
But they lose contact with the memory

And this leads to massive self-destruction
Alcoholism drug addiction
All desperate attempts at running
And in it's worst form
Becomes actual killing

And if there ever is gonna be healing
There has to be remembering
And then grieving
So that there then can be forgiving
There has to be knowledge and understanding

An American army regulation
Says you mustn't kill more than 10% of a nation
'Cause to do so causes permanent ""psychological damage""
It's not permanent but they didn't know that
Anyway during the supposed ""famine""
We lost a lot more than 10% of a nation
Through deaths on land or on ships of emigration
But what finally broke us was not starvation
But it's use in the controlling of our education
School go on about ""Black 47""
On and on about ""The terrible ""famine""""
But what they don't say is in truth
There really never was one

So let's take a look shall we
The highest statistics of child abuse in the EEC
And we say we're a Christian country
But we've lost contact with our history
See we used to worship God as a mother
We're sufferin from post traumatic stress disorder
Look at all our old men in the pubs
Look at all our young people on drugs
We used to worship God as a mother
Now look at what we're doing to each other
We've even made killers of ourselves
The most child-like trusting people in the Universe
And this is what's wrong with us
Our history books the parent figure lied to us

I see the Irish
As a race like a child
That got itself basned in the face

And if there ever is gonna be healing
There has to be remembering
And then grieving
So that there then can be forgiving
There has to be knowledge and understanding",Famine

Sinéad O'Connor,"I do think that women could make politics irrelevant.
By as a kind of spontaneous cooperative action,
The like of which we have never seen.
Which is so far from people's ideas of state structure
And vital social structure that seems to them like total anarchy.
And what it really is is very subtle forms of interrellation

Which do not follow sort of hierarchical pattern which is
Fundamentally patriarchal.
The opposite to patriarchy is not matriarchy but fraternity.

Sinéad O'Connor,"My own love said to me, ""My mother won't mind
And my father won't slight you for your lack of kind""
He went away from me and this he did say
""It will not be long, love, till our wedding day""

He went away from me and he moved through the fair
And slowly I watched him, move here and move there
He went his way homeward with one star awake
As the swan in the evening moves over the lake

I dreamed last night that my own love came in
He came in so sweetly his feet made no din
He stepped up beside me and this he did say
""It will not be long, love, till our wedding day""

Till the baby comes.
God will take all fear,

I am in your heart.
I only can have that part.
I am in your dreams.
I only can touch these things.
I am who gives the breath.

Your baby in my belly

Sleep safe in the night now love
Sad dreams never come true

You'll always find that one who loves you
You'll always find that one who loves you

Oh, my love, your love 4 Ireland

Where there was not too much going on down 
For girls whose only hope 
Was not to find a man who could piss in a pot 
So early I heard my first guitar 
And I knew I wanted to be a big star 
And I told my poor worried father 
Said I ain't gonna go to school no more 
'Cause see I want to look cool and I want to look good 
With my hair slicked back and my black leather boots 
want to stand up tall with my boobs upright 
And feel real hot when the makeup's nice 
I get sexy underneath the lights 
Like I want to fuck every man in sight

Make you feel good make you feel all right

Gonna be a singer in a rock 'n' roll band 
And I'm gonna change everything I can

want to make my own living singing 
Strong independent Pagan woman singing

Sinéad O'Connor,"As I went out walking one morning in June,
To view the fair fields and the valleys in bloom,
I spied a pretty fair maid she appeared like a queen
With her costly fine robes and her mantle so green. 

Says I, ""My pretty fair maid, won't you come with me
We'll both join in wedlock, and married we'll be,
I'll dress you in fine linen, you'll appear like a queen,
With your costly fine robes and your mantle so green."" 

Says she now, ""You Young man, you must be excused,
For I'll wed with no man, you must be refused;
To the green woods I will wander to shun all men's view,
For the lad that I love fell in famed Waterloo."" 

""O, then, if you won't marry, tell me your love's name,
For I being in battle, I might know the same.""
""Draw near to my garment and there will be seen,
His name is embroidered on my mantle so green."" 

In raising her mantle there I did behold
His name and his surname in letters of gold;
Young William O'Reilly appeared in my view
He was my chief comrade back in famed Waterloo. 

But when he was dying I heard his last cry
'If you were here, Lovely Nancy, contented I'd die;'
Now Peace is proclaimed, and the truth I declare
Here is your love token, the gold ring I wear."" 

O, Nancy, dear Nancy, 'tis I won your heart
In your father's garden that day we did part.
Now the wars are all over, no trouble is seen
And I'll wed with my true love in her mantle so green.""",Her Mantle So Green

She is the belle of Belfast city
She is courtin' one, two, three.

All the boys are fighting for her.
They knock at the door and ring at the bell
Saying ""Oh, my true love are you well?""

Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes.

If she doesn't get the fella with the roving eye.

And the snow come tumblin' from the sky

She won't tell her Ma when she goes home

Sinéad O'Connor,"There was a Lord who lived in this land
He being a Lord of high degree
He left his foot down a ship's board
And swore strange countries he would go see.

He's travelled east and he's travelled west
Half the north and the south also
Until he arrived into Turkey land.
There he was taken and bound in prison
Until his life it grew weary.

And Turkey bold had one only daughter
As fair a lady, as the eye could see
She stole the key to her Daddy's harbour
And swore Lord Baker, she would set free.

Singing, 'You have houses and you have linen,
All Northumber belongs to thee
What would you give to Turkey's daughter
If out of prison she'd set you free?'

Singing, 'I have houses, I have linen,
All Northumber belongs to me
I would will them all to you my darling,
If out of prison you set me free?'

She's brought him down to her Daddy's harbour
And filled for him was the ship of fame
And every toast that she did drink round him,
'I wish Lord Baker that you were mine.'

They made a vow for seven years
And seven more for to keep it strong
Saying 'If you don't wed with no other woman
I'm sure I'll wed with no other man.'

And seven years been past and over
And seven more they were rolling on
She's bundled up all her golden clothing
And swore Lord Baker she would go find.

She's travelled East and she's travelled West
Until she came to the palace of fame
'Who is that, who is that?' called the young foot soldier
'Who knocks so gently and can't get in?'

'Or is his lordship himself w",Lord Baker
Sinéad O'Connor,"We were homeward bound one night on the deep
Swinging in my hammock I fell asleep
I dreamed a dream and I thought it true
Concerning Franklin and his gallant crew 

With 100 seamen he sailed away
To the frozen ocean in the month of May
To seek a passage around the pole
Where all poor sailors do sometimes go. 

Through cruel hardships they vainly strove
Their ships on mountains of ice was drove
Only the Eskimo with his skin canoe
Was the only one that ever came through 

In Baffin's Bay where the whale fish blow
The fate of Franklin no man may know
The fate of Franklin no tongue can tell
And Lord Franklin among his seamen do dwell 

And now my burden it gives me pain
For my Lord Franklin I'd sail the main
Ten thousand pounds I would freely give
To know Lord Franklin, and where he is.",Lord Franklin

She was a fishmonger and sure it was no wonder
For so were her father and mother before

Through streets broad and narrow

Sinéad O'Connor,"Your hills and dales and flowery vales
That lie near the Moorlough Shore.
Your vines that blow by borden's grove. 
Will I ever see no more

Where the primrose blows
And the violet grows,
Where the trout and salmon play.

With my line and hook delight I took 
To spend my youthful days. 

Last night I went to see my love, 
And to hear what she might say.
To see if she'd take pity on me, 
Lest I might go away. 
She said, ""I love an Irish lad, 
And he was my only joy, 
And ever since I saw his face 
I've loved that soldier boy.""

Well perhaps your soldier lad is lost 
Sailing over the sea of Maine. 
Or perhaps he is gone with some other lover, 
You may never see him again. 
Well if my Irish lad is lost, 
He's the one I do adore, 
And seven years I will wait for him 
By the banks of the Moorlough Shore.

Farewell to Sinclaire's castle grand.
Farewell to the foggy dew.
Where the linen waves like bleaching silk
And the falling stream runs still
Near there I spent my youthful days 
But alas they all are gone
For cruelty has banished me
Far away from the Moorlough Shore.",The Moorlough Shore

The twilight gleam is in her eye

for love is lord of all

and often when the beetles horn
Hath lulled the eve to sleep
I steal unto here shielding lorn

Fill to me the parting glass, Good night and joy be with you all.

If I had money enough to spend, and leisure time to sit awhile. There

Rosy cheeks and ruby lips, I own, she has my heart in thrall; Then

Stolen from our very eyes
And I wondered where you went to
Tell me when did the light die

You will learn, you'll return

There is no other Troy for you to burn

And I never meant to hurt you
I swear I didn't mean those things I said
I never meant to do that to you

What do you want to do?
Does she need you like I do?

Do you love her?

Sinéad O'Connor,"Couldn't sleep so I went out walking
Thinking about you and hearing us talking
And all the things I should have said
Echo now, inside my head

It just ain't fair this thing called loving
When one step there and the other feels nothing
I would have done anything for you
I still love you, baby I adore you

I feel something falling from the sky
I'm so sad I made the angels cry

Tears from the moon
Fall down like rain
I reach for you
I reach in vain

Tears from the moon
Fall down like rain
But tears from the moon
CanÂ´t wash away the pain

Tears from the moon, tears from the moon (whispering a couple times) 

It just ain't fair this thing called loving
When one step there and the other feels nothing
I would have done anything for you
I still love you, baby I adore you

All day I keep from falling apart
But at night when the sky gets dark

Tears from the moon
Fall down like rain
I reach for you
I reach in vain

Stop, Stop haunting me
It should be easy
As easy as when you stopped wanting me
Hmm",Tears from the Moon [Album Version]

All up in his wings

Do we have the balls to go to their party
Or do we rather stay in times with vanity

When we can barely raise a fitting girl
To help her own sisters and brothers

Now we're gorged upon what devils feed

Telling the youth to worship futile dreams
And alone for begging for material things

To whom exactly are we givin' hope
When we stand behind the velvet rope
Or get our pictures taking with the pope
Like some sick April foul kind of joke

The one that telling the most conquering kin
Who looks around at everything
And sees exactly what we've been

Asking you did you love only you?
Or did you stand for something else?
Besides the hankering for fame and fame itself

Will show you what a real VIP is

The fatherless
The motherless
The ravage child at home who cryin to you
You will be asked to say what did you do
And what's behind that velvet curtain
Don't know but I can say for certain

Will show you what a real VIP is",V.I.P.

Where every cloud is a stair leading closer to you
Why died I leave you at all, can you see when it brought me?
I'm so ashamed of the path I have taken in my life

Power is mine!

I go astray to make ammends for slaughtering
The young and innocent

They've closed the gates of eternity
And sent the enslaved souls to wander helplessly
Into the nothingness

As Alti casts her spell and closes in
Bonded by death to defeat her
We leave the prison of our bodies
Have our souls unite as one and.

She does the dance of spirits and commands them
To possess the lifeless ones

Hopelessly I lie and wait for redemption, as I slowly drift away

For all that I've been through don't know what else to do

Your ears, never hear my cries
Your lips, never speak the truth
Your hands, never hold me tight

Because I'll only be noticed when my name is written in stone

Weakened from sorrows past
I've lost all the will to try
So I slowly wait to die

How long should I will regret? Why me? I have paid my dues
So lost, how can I be found? I wish time would heal my wounds

Baby baby shake it up and come along

Late night
Bring back the heat some more
What's right
I don't know what I'm waiting for
It takes all that I have
Just to move along
It takes all that I have
It takes all that I have


Last call
That's what I said tonight
Passed out
Lose control in the fading light
So many nights spent with you in the beginning
It takes a while getting used to having nothing


I would give all I have
Just to be what you need
Until the end
I'd give myself to be and to hold you close again

The complications you have failed to comprehend?
I know I know you're wasting time
You're wasting time on me

Tell me do you still have pieces of me
Cause I'm not complete at all
We can try, we can try but we're never gonna get it right
Unless we fall

And now that all is said and done
I guess it's time to turn our backs and run
Away so I can finally take the break that I deserve
Then while we're at it we can slowly build this bridge
And burn it to the ground in a matter of 10 seconds

When the filaments burst and there's no light
To lead you to anywhere useful, you're severed there

On strings and they never forget
I can't take anymore, I'm over it now
I can't take anymore, anymore

And the cameras collapse, you will faint in respect
Let the flash of your past help you never forget
All the things that you're not
All the people you've failed to remember, return to sender

When there's nowhere but black and there's sharks creeping in
When you're withered and torn from the weakest of things
Like the loose leaf parade of the rain on the electrical wires
Such electrical lives that we lead
I promise that I'll never leave you alone

Hartes Los doch ich komme los und ich zahl den hohen Preis

Ich muss weiter, immer weiter gehen ohne rast und ruh'
Mich stoppen keine Schranken keine Wände, der Horizont ist ohne Ende
Ich muss alles geben, alles geben es gehört nicht viel dazu
Nur mein ganzer Mut und mein Herzensblut
denn dies' ist es Wert (dies ist es Wert yeah) 
dies muss es werden (dies muss es werden Hey)

Und Wenn ich am Abgrund steh', und nicht weiß wie es weiter geht
Die Last auf meinen Schultern liegt. Ist es Liebe was ich Brauch
kleine sorgen sind keine Sorgen (ich bin Sorgen gewohnt) 
Weine morgen im hohen Norden (wer sieht's da oben schon) 
Meine Worte sind die reinste Sorte pures Elixier
Wahres Leben, alles geben, was steckt noch in mir

I gotta shake you off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
Cause I'll be on my way
See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say ""I told you so""
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

[Chorus]

I gotta, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
(Gotta shake it off) off, shake, shake, shake, shake, 
Shake it off, shake, shake, shake, shake,shake it off

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
so I'm leaving you behind
Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know

[Chorus]

I gotta, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it

Sorrow in my soul
Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside

Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek

Asks if I'm gonna be out late

A lie I didn't have to tell

Car je ne veux pas qu'on finisse pauvre !
T'as rien compris nous on s'en fout de ta tune, on s'en fout de ta rue,
Mais tu me rends fou t'as vu !
Parce que je veux pas nous voir en bas,
Je veux que les rent-pa nous voient en star,
Mon frère moi j'aimerais juste que t'arrêtes d'aller au shtar 

On a le même sang mais c'est pas pour autant qu'on se ressemble,
Pas pour autant qu'on s'entend
Pas pour autant qu'on avance dans le même sens
Pas pour autant pas pour autant qu'on s'aime pas

On a le même sang mais c'est pas pour autant qu'on se ressemble,
Pas pour autant qu'on s'entend
Pas pour autant qu'on avance dans le même sens
Pas pour autant pas pour autant qu'on s'aime pas

Ma soeur, je mène ma vie dangereusement
Entre le luxe et la misère j'ai fait mon choix malheureusement,
C'est dur de remonter la côte défoncé à l'alcool,
Au cas où tu le sais pas les fachos ont des flashballs!
Tu parles de fonder une famille, mais tous les kondés me fatiguent
Ma vie n'est plus très sure c'est le béton qui me l'a dit
Trop de galère les soucis me déboussolent
L'argent que je vous donne est aussi sale que le sous-sol
Mais remballe ta morale à deux balles t'as rien compris,
Le daron sera fier quand la baraque sera construite
Aller arrête 
Des substances, des poèmes, des mauvaises résolutions,
Dans le cerveau plus de problèmes que de solutions !
C'est pas fini, la suite est dramatique,
Quand la situation s'aggrave la tise la dédramatise ;
Il fallait faire ce choix, j'ai préféré
te savoir riche et en colère
Plutôt que pauvre et fier de moi",Le Meme Sang
Sinik,"Noyé par les larmes, assoiffé par les armes
Je combats les mots pour les maux
Mieux que le mal par le mal

Les armes : tout le monde en veut c'est dérisoire,
les jeunes adorent en faire usage pour des histoires de territoire

Les larmes : deviennent des flaques puis des rivières
présentent sur les joues de nos mères lorsque nos juges délibèrent

Le drame : c'est qu'on est plus habilité à faire du trafic en sous-sol
que de la comptabilité

Le crack : fait son entrée dans la partie,
c'est tout nouveau bienvenue dans la bad trip de la matrice

Le hall : reste l'endroit où l'on demeure dans les vapeurs
de beu le voisinage est pris de peur

La drogue : certains la fument d'autres la vendent,
l'erreur c'est de penser qu'elle te fait remonter la pente

L'alcool : atténue la vision des choses,
peut te faire croire que tout est rose mais dans le fond tout est faux

La mort : ne préviens pas quand elle s'infiltre,
elle n'envoie pas de sms quand elle s'invite

{Refrain:}
Je voulais vous le dire avec des phrases avec du flow
Oeil pour oeil, dent pour dent, mots pour maux,
Noyé par les larmes, assoiffé par les armes
Je combats les mots pour les maux
Mieux que le mal par le mal

Les flics : même s'ils te tuent sont acquittés mais peuvent
te faire tomber en taule pour quelques graffitis sans graviter

Les films : de plus en plus violents le public aime ce qui choque,
à quand le court métrage sur Guy Georges

Les filles : n'ont plus de respect pour leurs corps,
elles baisent dès le 1er soir avec leur mec ou leur pote

Le fric : fait tourner le ness, fait tourner la tess,
fait tourner le monde mais fait aussi tourner la tête

La haine : fait des ravages dans les tier-quar,
provoque la mort et la bagarre, les incidents et les dégâts

La guerre : détruit les maisons en Irak,
elle tue les femmes et les enfants, les innocents et des G.I.

La peine : te laisse des rides en héritage,
n'importe qui la décèle parce qu'elle se lit sur les visages

La paix : se négocie mais ne vient pas,
se mérite ne se vend pas, s'installe mais ne tient pas.",Mots Pour Maux
Sinik,"Eh t'sais quoi dans la vie y a un temps pour tout,
Un temps pour niquer
Un temps pour se calmer
Un temps pour se faire pardonner
Parce que moi

J'ai fait des sales trucs ne m'en voulez pas
Chaque jour que dieu fait j'essaie d'être de plus en plus droit
Le jeu de la vie est dure, on est constamment montré du doigt
Si tu veux pas qu'on te tue ici touche un gun ou touche du bois
Quand tu fais des sales trucs, excuse-toi
N'abuse pas même si on te juge pas
Le jeu de la vie est dure, soit on t'abat ou soit tu te bats
Tu te gares ou tu te barres, tu stagnes ou tu gagnes

Pardonnez-moi d'avoir causé du tort à la famille
D'avoir vécu à la va-vite, d'être la cause de leur fatigue,
Je demande pardon pour avoir tué ma jeunesse
Si j'ai les couilles de t'insulter je suis incapable de dire je t'aime
D'avoir connu l'enfer, d'y avoir séjourné
Considérant que les menottes ont plus de classe que les gourmettes
D'avoir agit de façon peu recommandable, ou d'avoir dit au procureur
""Fais ce que tu veux moi je m'en tape""
De croire que seul l'alcool me délivre,
De m'être cru dans le cartel de médéline
Quand je partais dans mes délires,
Pardonnez ma stupidité, avec mes armes je me défends
Mais j'ai cru que le vol était plus simple que le payement
De m'être cru capable, de tenir le coup
De rentrer défoncé au point de ne même plus tenir debout
Pardonnez moi parce que ma haine a de l'avance
Quand je vois que mes potes sont au ballon
Mais que Papon est en vacance

J'ai fait des sales trucs ne m'en voulez pas
Chaque jour que dieu fait j'essaie d'être de plus en plus droit
Le jeu de la vie est dure, on est constamment montré du doigt
Si tu veux pas qu'on te tue ici touche un gun ou touche du bois
Quand tu fais des sales trucs, excuse-toi
N'abuse pas même si on te juge pas
Le jeu de la vie est dure, soit on t'abat ou soit tu te bats
Tu te gares ou tu te barres, tu stagnes ou tu gagnes

Pardonnez moi mais j'ai le coeur éclaté
J'ai plus d'amour pour le quartier que pour cette pute les deux jambes écartées
Pardonnez moi d'avoir séché la classe, l'enseignement est une richesse
Certains se battraient pour être à ma place
D'avoir choqué ma mère quand je dormais sous les verrous
D'esquiver son regard quand mes yeux verts deviennent rouges
De devenir ce que mon père n'a jamais voulu que je sois
Un gosse qui dors le jour et sors le soir
D'avoir écrit des rimes un peu stupides, un peu gratuites
Que je ne saurais vous traduire
M'en voulez pas d'avoir compris tardivement
D'aimer les armes au point d'apprendre leurs maniements naïvement
D'avoir vécu comme un malade, là où le malheur se balade
D'avoir foutu en l'air ma life,
Pardonnez moi mais la musique devient mon seul échappatoire
J'ai peur de terminer à l'abattoir

J'ai fait des sales trucs ne m'en voulez pas
Chaque jour que dieu fait j'essaie d'être de plus en plus droit
Le jeu de la vie est dure, on est constamment montré du doigt
Si tu veux pas qu'on te tue ici touche un gun ou touche du bois
Quand tu fais des sales trucs, excuse-toi
N'abuse pas même si on te juge pas
Le jeu de la vie est dure, soit on t'abat ou soit tu te bats
Tu te gares ou tu te barres, tu stagnes ou tu gagnes

Pardonnez moi pour tous ces moments difficiles
Pour tous mes excès de violence qu'ils soient verbales ou physiques
Pardonnez moi mais j'ai du mal à décrocher
D'avoir incité à la haine lorsque la paix était prônée
De passer mon temps à bailler,
D'avoir franchi tout ces paliers, de faire du mal à mon cahier
Pardonnez moi trop de lois j'ai enfreint
Pour ça j'ai laissé mes empreintes, je vais changer soyez sans crainte

J'ai fait des sales trucs ne m'en voulez pas
Chaque jour que dieu fait j'essaie d'être de plus en plus droit
Le jeu de la vie est dure, on est constamment montré du doigt
Si tu veux pas qu'on te tue ici touche un gun ou touche du bois
Quand tu fais des sales trucs, excuse-toi
N'abuse pas même si on te juge pas
Le jeu de la vie est dure, soit on t'abat ou soit tu te bats
Tu te gares ou tu te barres, tu stagnes ou tu gagnes",Pardonnez Moi
Sinik,"Ce soir je gratte le cahier, l'inspiration sortie d'une cage d'escalier
Ce soir je dors dans une tombe emportée par le son escorté par le songe
Le stylo plume crie à ma place, c'est le côté malsain qui se reflète dans la glace
N'importe qui peut te descendre dans le 91 y'a plus de morts que de naissances

J'ai pas le moral tous les jours c'est l'automne
Moi je ne veux pas me mettre au norme tous les chemins me mènent au Rhum
Je ne pense qu'à rapper, je dors sur le canapé
Malin j'ai raquetté la ceinture noire au prof de karaté
Un bon verre de sky comme petit ami
Dans la té-ci on touche le fond sans faire la bise au Titanic
J'ai commencé sans un sou sans rien en poche
Et entre nous je me fous de vos entretiens d'embauche
J'ai des soucis quand la justice veut en découdre
Le genre de problème que même un prof de maths ne pourrait pas résoudre
Les contentieux se règlent aux clés à molette
Dès le matin je trempe mon join dans le chocolat au lait
Le taux de chômage explose dans le quartier
Mais y'a toujours une solution les hôpitaux recrutent des brancardiers
J'écris sans mes neurones parce que je peux laisser ma vie pour des histoires qui vont de 2 à 200 000 euros
Un join de plus et je m'envole en catapulte si tu me vois pas en bas de la rue
C'est que je dors en garde à vue Ma gueule
Toujours en force dans le hall, j'ai commencé par prendre des heures de colles après j'ai pris des jours de taule
C'est le déclin et dans ce monde je suis bien seul
1.2. Ici tu passes du rire au deuil en un clin d'oeil
Les lois je transgresse, le foie je transperce
Les femmes sont des garces
Ma Playstation mérite plus de tendresse

Sombre !! Ce soir je gratte le cahier, l'inspiration sortie d'une cage d'escalier
Sombre !! Ce soir je dors dans une tombe emportée par le son escorté par le songe
Sombre !! Le stylo plume crie à ma place, c'est le côté malsain qui se reflète dans la glace
Sombre !! N'importe qui peut te descendre dans le 91 y'a plus de morts que de naissances

Dans ma rue on aperçoit la Tour Eiffel
Chez nous c'est pas le chant du coq c'est les poulets qui nous réveillent
Ca sent l'odé sur un banc abandonné il me faut un bête de véhicule car je n'aime pas la randonnée
Moi, j'esquive les barrages de la douane le point commun entre mon ciel et mon hôtel c'est que les 2 n'ont pas d'étoile
Les portes sont verrouillées les jeunes ont des problèmes dans un pays qui considère David Douillet comme un prophète
Y'a que des oufs comme à l'asile les flics sont des paparazzis
Toutes mes photos sont chez les keufs pas dans les magasines
Démolition de portraits, déclaré forfait
Compare les Ulis à New York en plus solide que le World Trade
Je suis un magicien, ma culture vient de la Ur
Je n'ai pas lu les misérables j'ai lu le parisien
Va dire aux putes que je veux prendre de la hauteur
Avec mon stylo plume directement relié au coeur
Loin de Paris je ressens le mal du pays si je vais en taule envoyer une carte postale du périph
J'ai le regret de vous annoncer qu'on régresse
Alors parle à mes fesses moi j'écoute dieu pas la maîtresse
Mentalité nique la terre quand les keufs passent lance une pierre
Autant de pression dans cette phase que dans une bière !!!!!

{au Refrain}

Sombre !! Les plus gentils font de la peine les guerriers sont plus nombreux que les partisans de la paix
Sombre !! Je ne rigole pas tel un videur y'a que des gueules d'enterrement les chrysanthèmes sont de rigueurs
Sombre !! Je viens vous faire part de ma lassitude t'inquiète j'ai l'habitude de la vie dure
Tel est le style de ma musique
Sponsorisée par un fusil",Sombre
Sinik,"J'ai eu mal quand on m'a dit que mon ami était à terre,
Quand j'ai appris qu'il était mort d'une hémorragie interne ;
J'ai souffert quand les kondés m'ont tabassé,
Devant le rire de l'inspecteur quand les pompiers m'ont ramassé ;
J'ai rigolé avec un peu de chichon dans le crâne,
J'écris les pages de ma vie, mets-moi un petit peu de son dans le casque...
J'ai regretté d'être celui qui portait l'arme,
D'avoir laissé toute une famille au bord des larmes,
J'ai maudit ma fierté d'Ulyssien celle qui m'empêche de dire à ma mère
Que sans elle je ne suis rien !
J'ai trafiqué pour être beau et faire des sous parce que les sapes de la croix rouge ne correspondent pas à mes goûts,
J'ai compris que la musique était mon truc que ça prendrait plus de temps vu que je ne donnerai pas mon uc !
J'ai appris que la liberté ne se vend pas,
Mais qu'elle vaut chère lorsque le juge s'en empare !
J'ai réalisé combien mes potes valaient chers
Que l'amitié ne se prend pas à la légère frère,
J'ai grandi l'esprit en décalage,
La drogue n'a rien de douce quand te scotche au carrelage
J'ai travaillé mes rimes durement si tu savais
Pour qu'on me dise que mon pe-ra il tue sa mère !!
J'ai pleuré toutes les larmes de mon corps comme un gosse
Devant la tombe en marbre de mon soce !

{Refrain:}
Viens !!! Viens !!!!
Je te ramène dans un monde où la violence se répand où seules les bombes se répondent,
Viens !!!
J'habite dans un tier-quar tout pourri on voit des cars de CRS mais pas des cars de touristes
Viens !!! Viens !!!!
On a la rage toute l'année format A4 pour écrire OCB Slim pour planer
Viens !!!
Tu verras bien qu'on s'entretue tu comprendras pourquoi les caméras ne rentrent plus !!!

J'ai kiffé quand on m'a dit ton pe-ra est crédible,
J'ai eu peur quand le docteur m'a dit ton état est critique,
J'ai connu ces moments de galère où ça va mal quand le frigo te fait penser au Sahara !
J'ai pionsé sur des bancs de garde à vue,
J'ai fumé sur un nuage et l'allumage me catapulte.
J'ai esquivé les enquêtes et les crochets,
J'ai perdu mes procès mais je conserve mes trophées.
J'ai nagé dans une mer de whisky j'ai conservé ma dignité évitant de faire le miskin !
J'ai rappé tristement parce que nos vies en sont de même,
J'ai pas le niveau chanson de merde !
J'ai chassé les vautours de mon esprit parce que les jeunes ont des teaux-cou
J'ai dû m'inscrire à l'escrime.
J'ai roulé ma bosse au crépuscule
J'ai purgé toutes mes peines derrière une barre de muscu !

{au Refrain}

J'ai démoli mon avenir, tout seul, à coup de délits stupides
J'ai fait couler mon navire en douceur.
J'ai apprécié qu'on me relève quand je tombe,
J'ai accepté en grandissant qu'on me reprenne quand je me trompe.
J'ai traîné toute la nuit, jusqu'à l'aube,
J'ai espéré ne pas compter sur les arnaques ou les alloc...
J'ai encaissé quand le père de la victime m'a dit
"" Petit con tu mérites la prison à vie ""
J'ai soufflé les bougies et l'alcootest
J'ai dit au revoir à mon permis et je me suis mis à la contrex
J'ai chanté ma déprime !!!!!!",Viens
Sinik,"Fred:
Salut Sinik, merci de passer tard ce soir en nocturne. C'est assez marrant depuis que j'ai dis que tu venais ya des tonnes de messages qui arrivent sur toi.
Regarde là c'est sur internet et une en particulier, posée par émule du 05 qui nous dit : voila t'es blond tu fais des clash, t'es un petit peu le Eminem français, tu ressens quoi quand on te dis ca ?

Sinik :
Ca c'est le genre de question qui fait péter un plomb,
Car je suis blanc je suis bon mais ne croit pas que je suis blond.
Tu me parles des clashs de son film et de son clip mais
Je me battais dans les battle quand Eminem n'avait pas lu son script.
J'suis venu sans faire de pub sans jamais faire de tube
Et tu me compares à un lascar qui traîne sa mère de pute
En plus je suis pas du genre à parler vite,
Le seul docteur que je connais fait des piqûres pas des beats

Fred :
Nan, nan attends attends je voulais pas t'énerver mais t'es d'accord que si je reprends la première question, on peut pas s'empêcher de te comparer à lui parce que t'es blanc parce que tu rap.

Sinik :
J'en ai marre qu'on me compare parce que je suis blanc je rap et j'ecris
Si je résonnais comme toi tous les chinois serait Jet Li
J'habite en France mon rap ne touchera pas les states
J'm'appelles S.I.N.I.K j'exige qu'on me respecte

Fred :
Ok, Sinik t'en es maintenant à ton deuxième album, le précèdent ""la main sur le coeur"" a fait plus que disque d'or, tu fais des concerts, t'es en studio, comment ça se passe, les potes le quartier c'est toujours les mêmes habitudes, les mêmes regards ?

Sinik :
J'avoue c'est plus comme avant
Des amis j'en ai perdu tellement
J'aimerais tant remonter le temps
Mon équipe s'est réduite, j'ai trop la haine
Les fans ont remplacés les potes
Est-ce que rapper en vaut la peine ?
Aujourd'hui on se voit moins
Peut être 3 fois par an
Et je te jure que réussir tout seul c'est beaucoup moins marrant.
Nostalgique de la galère entre potos
Parfois il n'y a qu'un pas entre un album et un album photo
Le destin a creusé un écart
Comme si en baisant la musique j'avais tromper le tié-quart
Je regrette tous ces fous rires alcoolisés
Aujourd'hui je traverse la mer à la rame en solitaire

Fred:
Sinik on va parler de Diam's maintenant.
Diam's et toi vous venez du même coin (les Ulis)
On dit que vous êtes potes, on dit aussi des trucs qui sont parfois très dur contre elle.
J'voulais savoir si toi tu était touché par ça
Et surtout qui est-elle vraiment pour toi ?

Sinik:
Diam's c'est la famille, je l'ai vu défoncer les portes
J'ai pas attendu brut de femme pour être sure qu'elle était forte
Je recevais ses lettres par kilo en cage
Quand mon poto me faisait le coup du stylo en panne
Elle ma trouvé j'étais au fin fond du ghetto
Elle ma convaincu que vendre des albums c'est mieux que du bédo
Une brute de femme, du flow des putains de phases
Tu parles mais toi aussi tu la kiffer la putain de vibes
Les Ulis, mon shit ma musique et mes amis
PS: N'oubliez pas d'ajouter Mélanie
Alors ou les petites font du sur-place
Le rap au féminin n'a qu'un seul blaze

Fred:
Bon ok, la j'penses que sur Diam's on a bien compris, c'est la famille on touche pas.
Mais ya quand même quelque chose d'intéressant dans ta réponse, tu me dis ""Diam's t'envoyais du courrier lorsque t'étais en prison"" et la prison justement c'est pas la première fois que t'en parle, moi j'ai lu des interviews, tu l'a évoqué régulièrement, t'en a fais un morceau, c'était ""D332""sur ton premier album.
Honnêtement la prison Sinik, c'est ton fond de commerce non ?

Sinik :
Non, la prison j'y suis allé
Je m'en souviendrais
Mais pas plus que ça
Les journalistes en parle plus que moi
J'ai vraiment pas besoin d'elle pour être crédible
Va dire à la critique que je préfère ma vie a celle de Patrick Dills
C'est tu ce que c'est d'être enfermé par une bande de chien
Se demander si la famille ne manque de rien
Alors j'en parle pour faire plaisir à guillaume et Idris
Pour les petits qui pense que c'est mortel comme un hôtel IBIS
J'ai retranscrit pour m'encourager
Voulant tout lâcher j'en ai parler pour me soulager
Les plus belles amitiés de ma collection
Que le maton nique sa mère, les concernés se reconnaîtront

Fred:
Sinik, avant de te laisser filer, si on parle avenir proche, j'dirais que c'est maintenant, t'es venu avec le nouvel album, à quoi y faut s'attendre ?

Sinik :
Cet album c'est mon enfant, le plus hardcore de mes projets
J'ai mis la barre trop haute seul un avion pourra la décrocher
Que du lourd, des mélodies sortit du bloc
N'oublie jamais que le beat est le meilleur ami du flow
A mes yeux je reste vrai, sincère je le promet
Cet album c'est le deuxième il est meilleur que le premier
Des menottes, un stylo et quelques potes
Bienvenue ça commence par un piano et quelques notes",Dans le Vif
Sinik,"Wé c'est moi

Mais comment sa je te parle correctement tu parle à qui toi ?
(Qu'est ce que tu m'apporte va te faire foutre)
Eh mais ferme ta gueule ferme ta gueule tu parle a qui ?

J'avais tout pour reussir j'avais la vie devant moi
une femme de reve 2 enfants une maison et un emploie
j'voulais l'bonheur de ma famille la veriter
que notre vie soient ressemblentent à une serie americaine
mais bon l'amour c'est comme les fleurs
sa fane sa part en couille et sa commence quand tu t'embrouille avec ta femme
et pendant s'temps comment sa va demande les autres
bien sauf que j'ai peur de la boxer devant les gosses
peut a peut j'y laisse mes forces et mon courage
quand tu comme a te souler a croire que sa te soulage
et puis un jour elle en a eu marre que je la tape
en rentrant aprés le taff j'ai vu sa lettre sur la table
expliquant qu'elle en a marre des bagares des mésententes
qu'elle a rendez vous cher le juges pour la garde des enfants
des nuits blanches en regrettant en relisant sa lettre
comment prier le ciel quand il te tombe sur la tete

Alors je chante pour oublier que j'ai mal
pour que sa change pour croire que je m'evade
Alors j'ecrits pour oublier que c'est triste
je décris pour oublier que je deprime
Alors je chante pour oublier que j'ai mal
pour que sa change pour croire que je m'evade
Alors j'ecrits pour oublier que c'est triste
je décris pour oublier que je deprime

Je ne suis qu'un homme à la derive
seul dans une maison vide mes souvenirs
ne suffisent plus donne moi une seule raison d'vivre
moi qui penser que cette histoire aller me servir de leçons
moi qui penser avoir deja toucher le fond
je me forcer a boire comme si je buvait de la pisse
et mes collegues on remarqués que je puer la tize
le boss ma convoquer sans faire de sentiments
et si ma mort avait un nom je l'appelerai licenciement
mais que croit tu c'est pas un choix c'est un choc
france telecom et EDF t'obligent a retrouver un job
endeter j'ai l'impression que je m'enterre
perdu mauvaise nouvelle verdict pension alimentaire
et tu comprends que t'es amis sont des lacheurs
toc toc c'est l'huicier le comissaire et les déménageurs
alors bien sur que tu leurs souhaite de mourrir en enfer
tu repense aux gens chers à la vente aux encheres

Alors je chante pour oublier que j'ai mal
pour que sa change pour croire que je m'evade
Alors j'ecrits pour oublier que c'est triste
je décris pour oublier que je deprime
Alors je chante pour oublier que j'ai mal
pour que sa change pour croire que je m'evade
Alors j'ecrits pour oublier que c'est triste

J'me suis couché sous un pont si loin de mes reves
j'ai mon carton svp me voila donc SDF (putain)
j'ai plus de mots pour mes 2 momes que j'aimais trop
je reste la a pompé les megots a compter les metro
a demander de l'aide mais la misere ne se remarque pas
les passant passent mais ne regardent pas
les recruteurs me demandent ou je demeure
alors a cause de cette vie de merde j'ai des envis de meurtre
paranoiaque tu vieilli vite la rue te défouraille
a 35 piges t'a plus de rides que le pere Fourra
Sans amours sans domicile sans espoir
c'etaient l'histoire d'un homme sans histoire...

Encore un drame de l'exclusion un SDF a été retrouver
mort de froid dans une rue de paris la nuit derniere
l'homme avait 35 ans un ancien cadre superieur
dont la vie avait semble t'il basculer
c'est deja la quatrieme victime de la vague de froid
qui c'est abattu sur la france depuis 15 jours
Dans le reste de l'actualiter le sud de l'Inde est toujours en cause menacer ....

Alors je chante pour oublier que j'ai mal
pour que sa change pour croire que je m'evade
Alors j'ecrits pour oublier que c'est triste
je décris pour oublier que je deprime

à ton avenir ne dis jamais je vais improviser
Ne dis jamais quand je s'rais grand je s'rais un policier
Ne dis jamais je sors en boîte, ce soir je fais la fète
Surtout si le videur n'a jamais vu ta tête
Ne dis jamais je me sens égaré
Ne dis jamais j'suis comme tout le monde si ton appart fais 200m carré
N'oublie jamais le béton, le rrain-té
Si tu mens ne dis jamais sur la tombe de untel
Ne dis jamais jamais tout porte à croire que ça porte la poisse
Fin du couplet que l'on m'apporte à boire

Ne dis jamais j'ai tout appris, dans ce monde nul ne sait
Dans ce monde où rien n'est acquis, plus j'en bave et plus j'en aurais
Ne dis jamais tout est foutu quand les jeux sont même pas faits
Prends les choses en mains et fonces et surtout ne dis jamais jamais

J'adresse ces mots à ceux qui comme moi se cachent pour prier
Même si j'ai tord d'un rêve à l'autre, je me forge en secret
Et si j'en sors indemne
C'est parce que je ne dis jamais jamais!

Ne dis jamais j'ai tout appris, dans ce monde nul ne sait
Dans ce monde où rien n'est acquis, plus j'en bave et plus j'en aurais
Ne dis jamais tout est foutu quand les jeux sont même pas faits
Prends les choses en mains et fonces et surtout ne dis jamais jamais",Ne Dis Jamais
Sinik,"De nos jours le monde est mortel, les revolvers et les
cocktails, les prisonniers qui rêvent de putes et
d'hélicoptères, sortis de Paname, les armes sont toujours
fatales, la mort, le traffic et la drogue dure ça devient
banale.
Hardcore à la Tandem, j'avance dans la tempête, le Diable
veut nous tenter, j'espère avoir la trentaine.
Petite si t'as revé d'un ciel étoilé, sache que Roméo baise
Juliette dans les toilettes.
Les poukaves, la garde à v' et c'est le carnage.
Claque en CM2 une maison schlass dans le cartable.
Considères la rue comme un abris si tu reçois que des
insultes et des crachats comme un arbitre.
Ben ouais, parce qu'on fume la vie comme un mégot, les
inspecteurs de mes deux, les détecteurs de métaux,
représentant la tess et le 91, tous les reufrés qui chantent
le texte et le refrain.


Refrain x2 :

J'en place 1 pour la rue
2 pour mon bloc
3 pour mon hall
4-5 pour les keumés coincés en taule
6 pour le bizz
7 pour le 78 pour les pits
9 anti-keufs
10 pour les disques


C'est pour les jeunes qui vivent au portable, qui sautent le
portail, mes lascars qui veulent avoir le permis port
d'armes, qui font des cauchemars, dealer trouvent ça normal,
veulent une carrière à la Drogba ou à la Jordan, pour ceux
qui vomissent, les fautes qu'ils ont commises, personne ne
rigole, j'ai du respect pour les comiques.
Hey, c'est pour les frères et les soeurs de mon quartier, les
juges qui ne jugent que les épaisseurs de mon casier,
le moral cassé contraint d'aller bosser.
Naître pour n'être qu'un numéro de dossier.
Ceux qui en ont marre de devoir plaider, de prendre des PVs,
marre de voir des PDs, c'est pour les gentils, t'envoient
leurs têtes dans les gencives, les gros méchants ça tue les
gentils, retrouvés sans vie, mort pour un sans-fil, les
ennuis tu les empiles, tu meurs pour un centime.

(Refrain x2)

J'en place une pour les soldats qui ont peur de Dieu,
mais pas du sautage qui boivent des bières,
mais pas des sodas qui mettent des pare-balles qui prennent le partage,
une larme sur le parquet, une arme sous le parka.
Casseurs de vitrines, chasseurs de victimes, mais que veux-tu ?
Ce n'est plus des jeunes, c'est des vikings, les guns, les
fusils, les jeunes se fusillent.
Applaudissez la politique à la Poutine, dans la sécu, dans le
foot ou dans la peuta, il y a ceux qui veulent des medailles
et ceux qui vont a Meuda, ceux qui sont partis, ceux qui
trainent sur le parking, ceux qui te crèvent sur le parti

Sinik,"Je suis ce père de famille
Je n'ai pas su rouler ma bosse
Mais je me défonce a l'alcool
Puis je me défoule sur ma gosse
Je suis cette femme qui rêve d'une carrière dans le disque
Qui veut être star du cinéma, qui fera la pute dans le X
Je suis un étranger, dis moi je peux faire quoi
Puisque je ne fais que déranger
C'est ce que la France veut me faire croire
Je suis sans domicile, défiguré comme Albator
La société me fait comprendre qu'elle prend les hommes pour des labradors
Je suis maton j'enferme les hommes sans regrets
Je prends du plaisir quand je me rappelle qu'on me tapé a la récré
Je suis fugueur parce que mon cœur n'est plus qu'une cicatrice
Parce que les juges me veulent en psychiatrie
Je suis un clown dans un piteux état
Je m'oblige à être drôle pour oublier que ma vie ne l'est pas
Je suis un fou qui a perdu la boule
Puisqu'on ma traîner dans la boue, je viens dégainer dans la foule

Parce qu'on perd tous la raison
On rêve de brûler les saisons
Et de voler vers un horizon moins sombre

Ma gosse est à la DASS
Je suis une jeune groupille

Anorexie c'est mon ness-biz
Je veux ressembler à Britney Spears
Je suis consommateur, je me demande ou vont mes tunes
Je suis têtu alors je fûmes pourtant je sais que fumer tue
Je suis un condamné a perpette
Canal + pour me rincer l’œil
Je sortirais dans un cercueil
Je suis un grand malade
Courageux, écoute bien,
Je suis chauve mais la tondeuse n'y est pour rien
Je suis un enfant du ghetto comme Jackie
Je dors au CJD car je pratique le hall jacking
Je suis une mère de famille
J'ai peu d'argent et 4 gamins
Hier encore je cachais de la viande dans mon sac a main
Je suis un commerçant, le pharmacien
Dans le quartier depuis 20ans j'ai vus grandir mes futurs assassins

Tous mes camarades m'en veulent
Millionnaire mais tellement seul
Je suis l'ado en mal de tout un petit peu trop stupide
Bientôt je ne serais qu'une statistique du taux de suicide
Je suis une femme de ménage, comment te dire que je n'ai pas la haine
De ramasser une poussière qui n'est pas la mienne
Je suis un cancre face au mur pour être mutilé
Est-ce un crime de ne pas savoir multiplier ?
Je suis un arrivant, soulage mes yeux quand je les baisse
Pendant que les corbeaux discutent les chats mangent je les restes
Je suis ce jeune rappeur
Talentueux mais résolu
Incompris mais content car méconnu

Parce qu'on perd tous la raison
On rêve de brûler les saisons
Et de voler vers un horizon moins sombre
On veut pas être comme tout le monde

Sinik,"J'me présente j'étais un homme, aujourd'hui je suis un mort
Je vous regarde de là haut sans dire un mot tel un môme
Alcoolisé pour mieux exterminer le mal
C'est la bouteille qui m'a tué ma Mercedes a terminé le taf
Je peux tout voir même le fond de la téteille
J'ai vu mon ancien meilleur pote dire à ma femme qu'elle était belle
Et dire, que ce batard, a mangé à ma table
Ne dépose rien sur ma tombe offre des fleurs à ma femme 
Je vois ma pierre tombale, ceux qui viennent et ceux qui n'viennent pas
Plutôt ceux qui m'aiment qui ne m'aiment pas
Je peux tout voir et je n'vais rien vous cacher
Certains y pleurent certains y vont pour cracher
Je vois ma fille, je pleure quand j'ai le blue
Je la regarde, grandir, je me réveille quand elle tousse
Je refuse qu'elle voit mon nom sur une plaque de marbre
Il pleut car je pleure des flaques de larmes
Peu de regrets d'avoir laissé passer ma chance
De regarder mon plus jeune frère débarrasser ma chambre
De le voir devenir insolent, tête de pierre
Cané se réfugier dans les canettes de bières
J'aperçois Mélanie, tous les jaloux qui veulent sa mort
Hier j'ai vu un mec chelou près de sa porte
Je vois tous ces rappeurs, rapper tout haut se qu'ils pensaient tout bas
Vendre ma mort comme si j'étais Tupac

Moi je vois l'pont mais de l'au-delà 
Les mots me prennent à la gorge 
J'pourrais remplir des sots de larmes 
On m'a poussé à la faute 
De tout là haut j'me sens si seule si mal si loin des autres. 

J'ai remarqué que pour certains je n'étais pas irremplaçable 
Je suis mort mais ils ne parlent que de la taille de mon plasma 
Tous ces chiens que j'aimais tant que j'ai abrité de mon toit 
Se battent pour obtenir la garde pas de ma gosse mais de mon quad, 
De tout là haut je vois le maire manigancer 
J'ai vu comment ces buldozers avaient cassé l'bâtiment C 
Karim, j'étais présent à ton mariage, à titre postum 
De tout là haut j'avais enfilé l'costume 
Moi ma femme n'y arrive pas les rel'vés sont mensuels
J'deviens ouf hier j'ai vu son frère levé la main sur elle
Certains fans me regrettent j'en ai vu un s'couper la veine
J'fume une clope regardant mes res-frè tourner à Fresnes
Tous les matins à la même heure j'revois ma mère aller en course
T'imagine pas comment j'ai mal quand je l'entend chialer en douce
Mon père si courageux, toute une vie de sacrifice
J'ai tricar que son visage, en 2 piges en a pris 10
T'inquiète mon argent t'es reversé
Nabil, j'aimerais tant que tu m'entendes j'ai pas eu l'temps d'te remercier
J'ai tout vu de tout là haut les jaloux, jeter des yeux
Mais dans ma tête je restais jeune j'aime toujours jeter des œufs
Ignorant que mon regard venait des cieux
J'ai bien vu rue des Bergères que des enfants vendaient des xeus
VIP j'ai vu la juge faire du pied à Devillepin
Condamné on voyait Pix dans les promenades de Villepinte
Wesh mon vieux, ça fait un bail elles sont bizarres nos trajectoires
Te voilà seul et depuis peu ton frère Nasser est avec moi
Tous les jours ont r'fait le monde discutant regard au loin
T'es au courant malheureusement Bénaïssa nous a rejoint
Regretté je pense qu'eux même les plus lâche n'ont plus l'age
Solidaires alors ont traîne de nuages en nuages
De tout là haut, mes espoirs sont mes vœux
N'oubli pas que je vois tout que les étoiles sont mes yeux

Moi je vois l'pont mais de l'au-delà 
Les mots me prennent à la gorge 
J'pourrais remplir des sots de larmes 
On m'a poussé à la faute 
De tout là haut j'me sens si seule si mal si loin des autres

Sinik,"Moi j\'suis toujours froid 
Je n\'sais pas faire un pas de danse
Pas de chance 
Nul ne sais pourquoi je chante 
A quoi je pense
Au rodéo quand la police me fermait l\'angle
En garde à vue, mon propre sang me servait d\'encre
Malgré les mains qui se tendent 
J\'ai souvent mal quand je pense
A tous ces frères que je perds 
A toutes ces plaies que je panse
Ceux qui dénoncent la culpabilité de l\'autre
Je pense aux morts et à la guerre
A la stupidité de l\'homme
Je pense à un pote que j\'ai perdu, disparu en jouant les dingues
J\'ai plus qu\'une photo d\'vacances de Juan les pins !
J\'repense au terrain vague
Ça jouait au foot jusqu\'a s\'en faire du mal
Seule la nuit pouvait siffler la fin du match 
J\'pense à la taule pour Akim et izaka
A me casser de là parce que franchement ici ça caille  !!
Je pense à dieu à faire en sorte qu\'il me préserve
Ouais, je l\'avoue j\'ai peur du sors qu\'il me reserve 
Alors je pense à mon enfance, le hip hop , les larcins
L\'école du parc aux Ulis 
Olive et Tom sur l\'A5
A ma vie qui bat de l\'aile
Aux traitres aux Hypocrites
Aux jaloux qui tapent de l\'œil qui taffent pour 10 balles de l\'heure
J\'penses à l\'école à la prof au tableau 
A la craie perdue au fond d\'une classe à la traîne...
Aux acrobates qui traversaientt la ville en roue 
Une pensée pour les morts ceux qui nous ont quitté en route 

Mais putain comment te dire que tout va bien si tout va mal
J\'ai le cœur le plus niqué de tout Panam
J\'ai les mots les plus touchants du macadam 
Ouais, j\'ai ce flow ce putain de vague à l\'âme...

Mais putain comment te dire que tout va bien si tout va mal
J\'ai le cœur le plus niqué de tout Panam
J\'ai les mots les plus touchants du macadam 
Ouais, j\'ai ce flow ce putain de vague à l\'âme...


Je refais le monde avec un stylo dans la poche 
Quand je pense je vois mon oncle avec un tuyau dans la gorge
Je pense aux frères qui ont tirés qui ont té-cal
A séquestrer les 2 huissiers qui m\'ont virés de mon tier-quar
Au 31 le voisinage faisait la gueule 
C\'était l\'époque où les bollosses en file indienne faisaient la queue
Je pense à ces brassards qui veulent me lever dans mes draps
Quand ce poissard d\'amis d\'enfance a failli crever dans mes bras
Les années passent, je pense à cesser la musique
A la douleur de nos darons qui se sont baisés à l\'usine
A nos banlieues qui se consument aux raz des flammes 
Voyant le monde, c\'est pas demain que PPD fera des blagues ! 
Je pense aux miens qui doivent attendre pour être conditionnables
Aux chiens qui peuvent confondre le commissaire et le confessionnal
Ça finit mal quand la police part à la pêche
Alors je pense qu\'il est grand temps de m\'arracher à Marakech
Je pense à ma cité qui part en couille de jour en jour
Ce maudit maire qui démoli tous nos repères de tour en tour
Je pense à ma vie mes espoirs et mes projets
Mes histoires et mes procés 
Mes victoires et mes trophées
Frère, Tu vas comprendre à quoi j\'pense 
On va faire simple
A être bon et généreux
A la prière à en faire cinq 

Mais t\'en fais pas, c\'est bientôt l\'heure du debranchement
Mes douleurs sont des paroles et mes pensées sont des pansements... 
Mais putain comment te dire que tout va bien si tout va mal
J\'ai le cœur le plus niqué de tout Panam
J\'ai les mots les plus touchants du macadam 
Ouais, j\'ai ce flow ce putain de vague à l\'âme...

Mais putain comment te dire que tout va bien si tout va mal
J\'ai le cœur le plus niqué de tout Panam
J\'ai les mots les plus touchants du macadam 
Ouais, j\'ai ce flow ce putain de vague à l\'âme...

Quand je suis tout seul le regard posé au loin
Perdu dans mes pensées la tête entre les mains
Quand les souvenirs te poignardent
Quand la vie nous fait du mal que la joie est injoignable

Sinik,"Tout commence à la naissance
Te faire croire que l’on va tous dans le même sens, que l'on a tous les mêmes chances
Ils m’ont dit, compte les moutons et Morphée viendra te bercer»
Mais ça paye pas de faire le berger
Ils m’ont dit, mec, bosse ton bac
T’as aucune chance dans la chanson, pose ton mic
Que la vie était belle, ils m’ont dit, qu’est-ce t’en pense toi?
J’ai répondu, Franchement? Pas chez moi peut-être sur France 3
Que des biz de flûte, que des disquettes
Que si on me tire dessus, fallait juste faire le 17
On avait pas la vie devant nous, qu’on était pressé
C’est pas la vérité mais leurs mensonges qui m’ont blessé

Ils m’ont dit tout bas, souris, y a de l’espoir
Ne baisse pas les bras
Mais les vendeurs de rêves
Moi je les écoute pas, je fais ma life
J’avance avant que mon grand cœur ne saigne

Je voulais trouver du taf, ne pas flancher
Certains m’ont dit, peut-être, si Dieu le veut, reste branché
On m’a dit, Cette année les vacances seront faussées
C’est faux mais ça passe mieux que ""C’est mort, on est fauchés""
Je voulais sortir un peu, boire et spliffer
On m’a dit ""Impossible enfoiré, soirée privée""
Au cœur du cyclone
La cité, c’est mon daron qui m’a mis dedans c’est pas les cigognes
C’est clair que l’on t’a menti, de la gruge
On t’a dit ""Donne des blases et la juge sera gentille""
Ils m’ont dit ""C’était une de perdue, dix de retrouvées""
Y a que des meufs hots, je cherche encore les neuf autres
Leurs conseils ne traînent pas, lève tes savates
Ils m’ont dit ""La vraie vie c’est cravache ou mets des cravates""
Chacun aura son heure, fuck ces menteurs de merde
Faut écouter son cœur pas les vendeurs de rêves

Ils m’ont dit tout bas ""souris, y a de l’espoir
Ne baisse pas les bras""
Mais les vendeurs de rêves
Moi je les écoute pas, je fais ma life
J’avance avant que mon grand cœur ne saigne

J’ai vite compris que l’homme mène en bateau
Beaucoup m’ont dit ""T’inquiètes, tu sais bien je te les rends bientôt""
Que même un père qui t’aimait pouvait mentir
Je vous jure c’est pas la soupe mais les épreuves qui m’ont fait grandir
On m’a dit que c’était mort, le message devient navrant
Que le rap c’était mieux avant
On s’est dit ""Restons potes"", ça passe mieux que ""Je ne t’aime plus""
On m’a tellement vendu de rêves que je me lève même plus
C’est clair que l’on m’a trahi, trop de souffleurs
Je suis né dans les soucis, je ne viens pas du cul d’un chou-fleur
Que l’espoir faisait vivre, vraiment trop simple
J’ai plus confiance en mon chien qu’en mon prochain

Ils m’ont dit tout bas ""souris, y a de l’espoir
Ne baisse pas les bras""
Mais les vendeurs de rêves
Moi je les écoute pas, je fais ma life

Convaincu qu'personne m'aime, je mène la vie à Poutine
Le regard noir, toujours en guerre, la routine
Balafré, sourire cheum
Enterrer sa vie de garçon pour nous ça veut juste dire mourir jeune
Une odeur de roussi, alors je plane
Tellement de 'blèmes dans ma tête, je mange à Planète Soucis
Juste un frère à bout d'nerfs, en roue libre
Kalashnikov sur le dos, venu pour faire un bowling

J'suis au bout d'ma life
À deux doigts de craquer
J'suis dans des bails de malade
J'vais tous les braquer
J'suis au bout d'ma life
À deux doigts de craquer
J'suis dans des bails de malade
Solitaire et traqué

À part mes cicatrices, je ne regrette rien
Boom, flingue, avocat, stop la vida loca
J'ai fai du sale et j'ai fait du bien
Gros shlass de Star Wars, rendez-vous au parloir
Ils veulent trinquer à l'honneur de ma fin
Ok ok, tout ça on verra bien
J'ai pris des coups, j'ai pas lâché l'terrain
Bang bang bang paw, Lartiste et l'assassin

La drogue nous a baisé la tête, ma parole
On respecte les grands de la tess, on parle mal à la daronne
Parfois on rit du mal, ridicule, on met des armes
Dans nos clips, on craint plus Dieu, on flippe du tribunal
Des fois je comprends plus l'homme, il aime sa go mais tape du poing
Pour lui la carte fidélité sert au kebab du coin
L'enfer il s'y promène, mains dans les poches
Il a les clefs du nouveau Porsche mais il préfère voler des Citroën
Ils interdisent le joint, preuve à l'appui, pour l'avis des gens
Pourtant ils vendent du vin depuis la nuit des temps
Alors ils signeront
Mon arrêt de mort
Parce que fumer ce n'est pas bon pour la santé, parole de vigneron
Aimer peut faire du mal, en cachette, allez ré-pleu
Femmes battues, elles s'encouragent, ""allez les Bleus""
Avoir un prince charmant, elle te rabâche avoir ce triste but
Faux, elle ne s'attache qu'au roi des fils de putes

Au royaume de la triche, vie paradoxale
Riche grâce au crime, au football ou à la boxe thaï
Spliff à la bouche, nique tous les honneurs
Tise comme un ouf pour être ivre de bonheur

Ici on parle comme des bénévoles
Limite pâles, on prétend que c'est la crise
On met mille balles dans un téléphone
Des hommes en chute libre, en vrai ça survit
Des durs dans leurs clips pendant que leur mère mange que des Curly
Je ne cautionne personne, l'Homme est maître de lui
Ouvrir le feu est aussi bête que d'y mettre de l'huile
Ils parlent de liberté, font de la dictature
Demain si je vous baise, m'en voulez pas c'est une caricature
Ambiance parano, aucune tendresse envers sa mère
On dit ""je t'aime"" à des putains, on n'en pense pas un mot
J'ai peur de ce qu'elle devienne
Elle ne couche pas le premier soir
Pour faire la 'tasse elle attendra l'deuxième
On le sait désormais, tu perds la vie en garde à vue
Aucun voyou n'est plus dangereux que le Quai Des Orfèvres
Ils parlent de l'Islam, polygame
Tous des faux-culs, la première dame de France est cocu

Au royaume de la triche, vie paradoxale
Riche grâce au crime, au football ou à la boxe thaï
Spliff à la bouche, nique tous les honneurs

Quand on est jeune on veut rapper sa ville
Paradoxal, rester ici à 35 piges s'appelle rater sa vie
Bagarre au verre pilé, faut assumer
On dit aux p'tits de pas fumer, ce qu'on préfère nous c'est les faire dealer
Ils prônent la peine de mort, ces fils de chien ils ont le même harnais
Ils coupent la main qu'ils ont eux-même armé
Donc ils crient ""Liberté, port d'armes""
Les Kalach deviennent moins rare que certaines Jordan
Yeah, de quoi souiller son linge

Growing the fools and the victims he needs

Exposed the truth, raised up from the dead

In deepest trouble, a stranded man

Dan dies in a pool of blood
A jet's coming close ... as gas hits my nose
All the prayers came too late

And shadows surrounded me
Open eyes beyond the windows

In the deep red light
Why can't this night
Go on forever
I guess I tried too much
We were hungry for love
We take it up to the limit
And lose control

She hides her face
It was more than I romance
It's hard to love a man like me

I am richer than you
No matter your money,
I am richer than you
Life gave me this thing 
I truly wanted
Stronger than fame and power
Better than strength and beauty,
As good as love which is a magic thing
But sometimes love comes and leaves
Real friends,
Those who smile, smile when you're hight
They are always by my side
Take care of him if you've got one
Cause it's so hard to find
In this selfish time
So I know how lucky I am
I don't talk about those who're here 
In high moment
Far in sad events
I don't talk about those who talk and laugh with you
Then sus pon you",Real Friends

« Qu'ils aillent se faire mettre ! »
J'vois ce qui fut, ce qui est, et ce qui devrait être
D'où la colère que la déception fait naître
J'connais leur argumentation ( mensonge )
Des problèmes, pas de solutions ( mensonge )
Des progrès à attendre de la mondialisation ( mensonge mensonge )
Oublie l'argument comme quoi y a pire ailleurs
Sache que le malheur des autres n'a jamais fait mon bonheur
Et si les causes sont les mêmes
Les coupables sont les mêmes
Donc le combat est le même
Big Up à ceux qui le mènent
A ceux qui haussent le ton dans l'action
Aux motivés en faction
A ceux pour qui un monde meilleur n'est plus une fiction

Es-tu un de ceux-là, clandestins vers l’Europe
Reconduits en charters poignets dans les menottes ?
Peut-être es-tu tombé dans ton adolescence
Fauché par ce fléau dont on parle tant en France ?

Oh little child…
Raconte-moi ton histoire

Quel est le goût du thé que tu portes à tes lèvres
L’amer goût des regrets ou celui sucré des rêves

Oh little child toi l’enfant de Dakar
Il y a quinze ans déjà je croisais ton regard
Oh little child toi l’enfant de Dakar
Quinze années sont passées
Raconte-moi ton histoire

A l’image de ces enfants, grandit un continent
Tant d’obstacles à franchir tant de blessures à guérir
Pour qu’enfin l’Afrique sourie à son avenir
Pour qu’enfin l’Afrique sourie à son avenir

Oh little child…
Raconte-moi ton histoire
Raconte-moi ton histoire

Sinsemilia,"J’aimerais tellement pouvoir vous dire
Que rien ne va jamais finir
Que l’horloge peut se retenir
J’aimerais tellement pouvoir écrire
Que rien n’arrêtera les rires
Notre vie est une source qui ne saurait se tarir
Mais rien ne sert de mentir
J’aimerais au moins vous prévenir
Que c’est en les vivant qu’on construit les souvenirs
Qu’à trop vouloir courir
C’est nos vies que l’on finit par fuir

Refrain :
Laissez-nous prendre le temps
Laissez-vous prendre le temps
Laissons-nous prendre le temps
Juste quelques instants
Laissez-nous prendre le temps
Laissez-vous prendre le temps
Juste d’écouter le vent

Perdre sa vie à la gagner
Et voir défiler les années
Y sommes- nous vraiment condamnés ?
N y a t-il pas d’autres voies, que nous pourrions paver ?
N’y a-t-il pas de choix, d’autres priorités ?
Chercher le plus pas le meilleur
Ressemble tant à une erreur
Nous poursuivons un leurre
L’abondance de biens offre-t-elle le bonheur ?

J’ai peur qu’à la ligne d’arrivée
De cette course courue tête baissée

And we're all ready for Christmas Day

We're like presents all wrapped up
And we can't wait for you to give us away

The lower you stoop, the less the disgrace
You use all your charms to send me alone
Have you got the legs to call us to arms

Do we watch, do we ever stop

You would look and be amazed

You tire us

Verse 2
Feeling everything
All the problems I will bring
You might think that, that I'm OK
There's one word less that you can say
Fooling us like you fool yourself
You're in danger from your wealth
Treating stuff with no regard
Nothing sacred we are scarred

Chorus
You won't take
No rift from me
In every place

And you tire us out

Went oh yeah
Maybe
We should take a re-check

Staring at my shoe

Ten toes unravel 'Knots'

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"She's your little voodoo dolly
And she's gonna make you lazy
Like the little drum in your ear
Transfixes you to your fear

And now she's transfixed in your fear
And you know she's gonna stay there
Because her nails are deep in your hair
And she made you so unaware

Are you listening to your fear?
The beat is coming nearer
Like the little drum in your ear
Transfixes you to your fear

She's such an ugly little dolly
And she's making you look very silly
And when you listen in to her ear
You get paralysed with her fear

Oh down, down, down in your fear
Down, down in your fear

Now this little voodoo dolly
Has made you very lazy
And you're anemic from her sucking
And when your dead she'll find another

Better break that little dolly
And sling her in the corner
Now she's a sorry little dolly
Such a sorry little dolly

Are you listening to your fear
The beat is coming nearer
Like that little drum in your ear
Transfixes you to your fear

Listen, listen
Listen, listen
Listen, listen

I'll stay here a while in the cotton wool cocoon
Till the Chrysalis is ripe, till the time is right
With this feeling of insecurity
I have to shrink back inside, run and hide

Back in the cocoon, hugging my knees
Watching my insides, the skinned glow-worm writhings
Lying in blankets, I've been here a while
Tapping out rhythms, tapping out rhythms
Against the mattress and wall

The heat melts the sheets, another layer is peeled
Tapping out rhythms, tapping out rhythms
Just my cot, the wallpaper and me
I've been here awhile tapping out rhythms
Tapping out rhythms

Still finding charms in the memory of those constrictor arms
Glowing in the dark in my luminous green
A pearl beaded lizard bathed in a Gossamer scent
With my heat detector lip-pit, pulling at the newly formed tissue

Lying in blankets, I've been here awhile
Tapping out rhythms, tapping out rhythms
Against the mattress and wall

Waiting, waiting to loose the bandages
Waiting, for new appendages
Lying in blankets, I've been here a while
I've been here too long banging out rhythms

Listen for other tappings banging out rhythms
Banging out rhythms, banging out rhythms
Listen for other tappings banging out rhythms
Banging out rhythms

Tapping out rhythms, tapping out rhythms

And a slaughter grins, on a pleasure spike

When held on high by the riverside
Like a torn-throat child in a jackals hide
Cool water dies, vile diamond eyes

Silent in flamingo ease distant in troubled trance
Within a whirlpool, we're breaking our backs
The tears of the moon, the sweat of the sun
Sacrificial hearts for a pointing bone

With a gorgons head and a coal of skulls
They're kindling fires in open wounds
Pointing bone, in a jaguar skin, blood matted mane
Beacons blaze toward a waning moon

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"A ravenous greed for a brood to feed
A lusting spawn on a weekend fawn
Do you hunger for this, hunger for this?

Sucking leaches feel the need
Sucking dry unsated stomach pops
Sharpened knives, oh, with flying sparks
Sagging bodies with stretch marks

And your belly aches
Do you hunger for this, hunger for this?
Hunger for this, bled white with avarice

As the rust creeps
Corrosion seeps a rotting seed
Eat me, oh, feed me
With your belching foul breath

Your destructive kiss, death
Do you hunger for this, hunger for this?
Hunger for this, just a taste of a sweet kiss

Shanghaied on a locust flight
And the thirst from a vampire bite
Fills the emptiness inside
Consuming everything green eyed
We hunger, we hunger

We are hunger for this

The approaching disease, 92 degrees
The blood in our veins and the brains in our head
The approaching unease, 92 degrees

Long ago in the headlines, they noticed it too
But too late for the loved ones and nearly for you

Shaky lines on the horizon
Snakey thoughts invade each person
Watch the red line creeping upwards
Watch the sanity line weaken

The volcanic depths of Hades' ocean
Bubble under these crazed eruptions
It wriggles and writhes and bites within
Just below the sweating skin

I wondered when this would happen again
Now I watch the red line, reach that number again

Tempests threaten us today
There's no respite from long dark nights
Just the fantasy of spring

From the hailstones of summer
To a scorching winter land
A frozen death sleep, then this heat
Beats down on this buckled land

Flames lick closer to the core
From city limits fireball
And in a headless chicken run

Race red and screaming fire engines
Then the cannons came

Oh 'neath the brooding sky
Beneath its baleful eye
The cannon shot, the cannon crack
Disturbing night dreams

People fled in droves
To the lakes and to the shores
Left behind a near ghost town
Save the life of the cannons resounding

Still there was no rain
No rain, no rain, no rain

Hovers the preying sky

The unsuspecting horse was held fast to the ground
Whilst some soldiers slit open its belly

Whilst they sleep on endless, in their wrecked designs
Sleep on endless in your wrecked designs

Moths touched by flame repeat their fatal game
Forever and eternally, the cliffs around the crashing sea
Unsolved and endless, wait for me

Undulating far below, where lucid waters flow
Their faces seem to know

Where the land falls to an end

In jagged beams another night

A world of clay and taut convulsion 
The dream swan spins 
And cartwheel turns 
Down deep within your violet side

Skating down its morning swords to thaw your frozen eyes

And so conceal the heart that aches and yearns

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"Your parties fall around you
Another night beckons to you
Your parties fall around you
Another night beckons to you

Shadows look as you resist the gloom
Faded hues issue forth and bloom

A bed of leaves for a lover
Awake with a kiss and rise asunder
And when the party's over
You retreat in a realm of slumber

In your mind, crystal lights rebound
Wheels spin round and you hear the sound
Of autumn's call at party's fall, autumn's call

Through rose-tinted glass you still remember
The gladness, not sadness, only laughter

In your mind vicious lights rebound
Wheels spin round and you hear the sound
Of autumn's call at party's fall, autumn's call

The smile in the mirror grows weaker
The laughter you heard is growing fainter

Your parties fall around you
The night forgets to rouse you
Your party's fall astounds you
An aura of sadness abounds you

Glad rags sigh, maybe you're alone
Maybe you're alone inside, don't hide
Hurting all the time, hurting deep inside
Don't cry, don't cry

Icy breath encases my skin
Fingers like a fountain of needles
Shiver along my spine
And rain down so divine

A drowning so sublime
Spins in a heavenly climb

Calling you, tears thaw my sleep
Wanting you, this hoary web is weaved
From this strange confusion
Grows a perverse communication
It enthralls me and coils me around

Disconnected thoughts jangle in a mess

This unrest crucifies my chest
Without anesthetic it cuts
Through tumorous flesh
This unrest beats out my breath

This unrest beats in my chest
Discordant limbs watch unimpressed

At the aimless walk, the mindless talk
The pictures leap out and dance for me
They laugh at me

As your bitterness closes in
You're feeling very old again
Ah, just to sleep, without these thoughts
But the angels shout, resurrecting doubts

Ah, we meet again, my trusty friend
Demanding new favors for old time's sake
Inside this captive frame
Oh, come and claim your liberty

Metal and flesh will fuse today
These visions jump out and blast my days

Clean away, clean away, clean away
Clean away, clean away, clean away
Clean away, clean away, clean away

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"Now me and my partner we work on the run
The quick try to get quicker and the creepers get hung
It's you that got wasted tonight on the job
One lost his liquor, the other lost his hand

Ten sticky thumb prints on the door and the sink
But nothin' saw nothin' just smell the stink
Five hundred mugshots and a hundred to one
Four forgotten and the rest just won't come

When you've begun to think like a gun
The rest of the year has already gone
When you've begun to think like a gun
The days of the year have suddenly gone

Blood on the windows and blood on the walls
Blood on the ceiling and down in the halls
Papers keep pounding and everything that burns
People getting restless but they'll never learn

I picked up a doctor he's good with a knife
Says anesthetic's a waste of his time
Works in a hurry but always worthwhile
Knows they won't be back for a long, long time

Top of the staircase was ready to fall
We were still waiting downstairs in the hall
Well, watch out for big mama, she'll set you on fire
Or go for your neck with the chicken wire

When you've begun to think like a gun
The rest of the year has already gone
When you've begun to think like a gun
The days of the year have suddenly gone

Mother of plenty, mother of none
You've got me cornered I'm still on the run
I don't care nothing about you anyway
Stuck in this hole I'm well on my way

The rest of the year has already gone
When you've begun to think like a gun

My little Johnny Jewel
Oh he's so cool
He had no decision
He's just trying to tell a vision
Well some thought it sad
And others thought it mad
They're just scratching the surface
JJ couldn't be with the other kids
Was he on display?
No, no, not today
And all that guy ever said
He said ""I want my little wing-head""
He'd be half-asleep at night
Over his head the sensation of flight
And he'd wake up dreaming
Dreaming....

And he'd run down to the airport
The rush, the roar
And he'd crouch down behind the fence
With a chest full of lights
And then he'd lose his senses
He'd lose his senses....

Oh my little Johnny Jewel
Oh he's so cool
But if you see him looking lost
You ain't gonna come on so fast
Ah, but you know that he's paid
You know that he's paid the price

Alone what a word lonely
Alone it makes me cry

Softly into these broken dreams
Will you ever come home?
Will you ever be found?

Softly I whisper your name
Concealed in bedclothes of frosting cold

Softly the snowflakes start to fall
Fleecing the velvet skin
Suspended in frozen time
Icicles slowly drip outside
To the rhythm of your wounds here inside

I entered your dream, I entered your scheme
Softly to swim inside your veins
Softly in rippling cellophane
To float and glide in time
To the rushing in your brain

I wanted your lips, yes, I wanted your kiss
So softly the moment had flown
My body outside yours softly collects the falling snow
And disappears far away so softly

And pump ruby to the lip

Not sibling nor twin separated at birth

I dreamt I crossed the seven seas
And when I woke not knowing
I knew I led the double life

All I ever needed is twice removed
I spit my bile in an airless temper
In this vacuum a vampire reversed
This one who breathes life into me

And even dull mirrors reflect the tarnished twosome

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"I smash the glass into my face
Cutting through to my disgrace
Disregard for bone and flesh
How can I be in such a mesh of unlikeliness?
I smash my likeness
At my fingertips
With this blade turned in on me
Cutting an ancient tree
A cutter in a forest of industry
Upturning usurping
Love me hate me help me
Save me from me
Hold me hurt me stop me
Take this love out me
Anger tinged with sadness
It's always been like this
Place the dagger 'twixt my breast
My nearest and dearest
I hurt it I hurt me
Hurt everything around me
There's nothing no trace
Still cutting to find the place
Love out me! Love out me!
Anger tinged with sadness

No nothing no one no more
No no no no I can't take this

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"You buried it so deep
So safe in hidden sleep
But like a tell-tale corpse
Rises to the surface
Over-ripe & bloated
In naked time-lapsed truth
Thought it was lost forever
Remember this
How long has it been
Or have you forgotten
When you first forgot?
Now resurrection the phoenix
Aflame with pride & conceit
Remembers this
Wind blown trees outside
Applauding like the ocean
To the cacophony inside
The waves come rushing in
A crashing whispering
Drowning they drink me
Ah not forgotten
This is not forgotten
Remember this

Siouxsie and the Banshees,"O pull on the rein and haul me in
Back to the start where eyes first blink to see
A flowing mane a cut-glass limb
And they're falling soaring so rhythmically
O pull on the rein and haul me in back to the start
Rebirthed in ecstacy with cherubim and seraphim
When I was falling soaring so rhythmically
Falling soaring falling for you so completely
The Rapture unfurling blues and greens
The Rapture a swirling violet stream
Mystic majestic entangled in a web of curling vapour thread
Encaptured by forces unseen
Enraptured an eclipse intoxicating
Strangely not inside strangely not outside
Drowning in the middle of an eerie transition
And I don't know your name
Never been alive yet I haven't died
I hover disembodied in a semi-wakened haze
Floating far above the cloud
Sinking far below the ground
Only my senses remain
The Rapture unfurling blues and greens
The Rapture a swirling violet stream
Mystic majestic entangled in a web of iridescent curling vapour thread
Floating far above the cloud
Sinking far below the ground
No form only my senses remain
Wondering if I dare to say your name
Wondrous thoughts embalmed avow you came
By the crescent disc rising amethyst
How can love remain the same unchanged?
Moonlight plays upon this sunken brow
Midnight ink bleeds wet mercurial clouds
By the crescent disc rising amethyst
Somnambulist unharnessed storms the plough
By the crescent disc rising amethyst
How can love remain the same unchained?

In a silver swirl, I take a lungful in
Blow a fistful out if you could say you will

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

I saw it when you laid it on the table
Big disappointment to your fans
You want to throw, let's go for the floor man

Tongue lashin' suckers, black it like a statistician

Always gettin' caught with tactical equipment

Sir Mix-A-Lot,"Here's a gory kind a story about a ole be freak
With a forty-inch waist and a ten-inch beak
Overweight and out a shape with a triple chin
Her brassiere strike fear in the hearts of men

The girl's a Bremelo
The girl's a Bremelo

Me and Terry hoped the ferry we were lookin' suave
When I dip, hit the shift we were almost horse
It was a big Bremelo standin' on my toe
Had an over jelly belly tryin' to say hello
I was really kind a frightened as she looked my way
I tried to run because her buns made the ferry sway
To be blunt she was fat and ready for combat
All the way to Bremerton were the fat is at

The girl's a Bremelo
Let's go

I love bacon over steak and about those big ole ducks
She had hairy underarms and a whopping gut
My hair was short and wavy, drove my pit bull crazy
A Bremerton beast chasin' fellas in the Navy
After movie she's the feature, the Bremerton creature
You wear a life jacket if you ever try to freak her
Look at her physique she ain't my kinda freak
The floor creaks when the beast starts reachin' her peak

The girl's a Bremelo
Just a Bremelo
Change the beat!

You can't ignore the way she snores, cause she blows down doors
Baby's got the kind a face only a mother adores
A big basketball head with a 10-inch beak
Big lips, no hips with the smell of a beast
I couldn't put her in my Caddy or my tranny would break
I heard a dirt because of poverty, but she took my cake
When it comes to cool-Aid the girl would drink it in pints
You go to school for twenty years and your still in the ninth?

You're just a Bremelo
Just a Bremelo

You pink triple-chin unattractive duck
Your boyfriend beats freaks up to make a buck
Hangin' round third and Pike, on a ten-speed bike
You can say that I'm a liar, but you know I'm right
You talk behind my back, because I dropped you flat
And you never take a shower 'cause your too damn fat
So your man was smart when he broke your heart
Because if Mix-A-Lot a cut ya, you a fell apart
Wearin' polyester slacks, with elastic in the back
You could flatten Schwarzenegger in a wrestling match
You got lips like a character in some cartoon
With a pink posterior, you big baboon

Your just a

Now Bremerton's a city right outside of mine
Most girls there are ducks, but a few are fine
But the ones that I speak about
Used their face for catchin' trout
Vacuum clears for a mouth
You know what I'm talkin' about
Mud ducks, hockey pucks, drivers of Mack trucks
Lame brains, diesel trains, pick 'em up you have to strain
Big butt, crew cut, extraordinary gut
Big momma, kinda buff, facial hairs a kinda rough

Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck
Girl's a Bremelo

Sir Mix-A-Lot,"Now I'm your big mal dropper, mud duck stopper
Fila on the bottom and Adidas on the topper
Transform scratchin', big beat matchin'
I can tell you're getting jealous by the look I'm catchin'
I hate dumb skeezers, MC beater
Drop 5 grand on my bird white needer?
Smooth like ice, don't get nice
Just turn up the box for the Mix-A-Lot slice (huh huh)

why'all ready to get busy? (huh huh!)
Now, buttermilk biscuits here we go
Zip the flour roll the dough
Clap your hands and stomp your feet
Move your butt to the funky beat (huh huh)

Buttermilk biscuits

(Lord have mercy Mix-A-Lot's our here rappin' about biscuits now)

We from L.A. to the Carolinas
Dip them suckers in Aunt Jemima
Don't make a difference what food you make
Use buttermilk biscuits to clean your plate
You eat 'em in the morn', you eat 'em at night
Kentucky Fried Chicken makes the suckers just right
I am eat 'em with jelly it's my favorite deally
Wrapped and sealed by a freak named Shelley (huh huh)

Buttermilk biscuits
Buttermilk biscuits
Buttermilk biscuits
One day I kissed my freak, hit the street
Looking for something to eat
In a 18-wheeler, lookin' real swass
All the girls smile 'cause I'm the big boss
And I gotta eat now, can't eat later
Made a lot of noise to attract my waiter
The boy walked up, and what did he say?
""Say, buttermilk biscuits free today!""
So what you waitin' on boy, get up shake a leg
Gimme 10 of them suckers with grits and eggs
A glass of Koolaid and a whole stick of butter
Them biscuits make me a superfast cutter (huh huh)

Now grab that can and wrap it in your hand
Bang that sucker till it don't expand
Cook them suckers up in your oven
Grab your girlie and get a little lovin'
Add a bag of honey if you want to get funny
Microwave the suckers if you want your honey runny
Kinda get naughty at the Mix-A-Lot party
And rub them suckers all over your body (huh huh)",Buttermilk Biscuits (Keep on Square Dancin')

Somethin different, the boy never sounds the same

[Verse 1]
Body by Nautilus and you ain't even with this
I'm the man, all the homeboys want to dis
Crushin, killin, never beat stealin
But I'm hell when it comes to rhyme dealin
Death to competitors, long live Mix-A-Lot
You understand motherfucker I'ma hard rock
Beat 'em up and pick 'em up and make 'em miss the stick up
But my gat close range, take his wallet, kick him in his cup
Drop the games, cause they really ain't necessary
You can be a water rated, boy you ain't legendary
Sue it far in the Caddy, I'ma chillin
To your girlies I'ma hero, to you suckers I'ma villain
I've done, get me mad I might try
Can't find a better rhyme, if you do you better buy it
Serious and callous could be deadly to competitors
What am I sayin? (your gonna get yours)

[Verse 2]
Memories of bein broke, keep me on the war path
Hittin like a wreckin ball, Lord it's like a punk blast
Swayed, raid in effect, my posse's with it
Put a fifty on the floor, like a punk you wouldn't get it
Neck snap, head crack, put you on a meat rack
I ain't playin with you boy, you know I mean that
Physical rhymes all meant to intimidate
All niggaz take note, don't imitate
Rippin is the cut, freaks scurry for my T-I-P
Tryna get an autograph from M-I-X-A-L-O-T
Down for the title match and you know what I'm talkin about
Muscle bound, full of things, knock a sucker's lights out
Bring it to my level, boy you better start climbin
When she's grindin, I'm hardcore rhymin
Lyric to your gut and all your lines just buckle
When you make it to the top, I put these boots on your knuckles
Walk into the party like a mob, wearin jet black
""Swass"" skin in effect, sportin coon hat
Walk by sucker punk, look like eat crackers
He mumbled somethin, so my posse walked backwards
Catch 'em on the corner stone and hit 'em with the gat chrome
Let 'em know my posse's gettin bigger, when were back home
A big maulin, you know my beat is def
You know who you are, F the BS

Reconnect my dialect with modified jargon
Heavy snaps, never lookin for a bargain
Tumble when the pressure's on, walkin like a movie clips
Slow mo, pants low, jeans layin off my hip
Big shoes, laces loose, a rap warrior
Real beat boy, leavin crowds in euphoria
Transform, super fast, nice slice, what a blast
Movin like the speed of light, so quick I shatter plexiglass

You like my tuning cabilities, admit it
It's the man with the westbound attitude
Big gold rope, rusty knuckles, ain't afraid of you
Raise an eyebrow, try to figure out how

Understand it's the undercover game plan

All you wannabe gangstas, drivin' Volkswagons
Chillin' at the high schools, broke but braggin'
Under educated, your style is dated
You talk behind my back and your rope's gold-plated
But I'm back to take revenge, my beef will never end
I'll tear your midsection, 'til your body start to bend
Like a pistol, I'm a smokin'
I'm crushin', not jokin'
Whippin' sissies for a past time, and no I'm never chokin'
I blow away suckers with the flicker of my index
Not brass monkey, it's a natural reflex
Go getter tactics, makin' suckers holla
A vicious motherfucker with a rope around my collar
I carry lots a cash, I whip a sucker's ass
I drive a big Caddy, and I pull the trigger fast
Down at Arnold's on the Ave, I fight 'til the death
I let you suck my in my chest, and then I break your damn neck
I got the cold beats rippin', your needle's not skippin'
So many damn weapons that the military's trippin'
People in Seattle hate me, cause I'm not like a hood
But you rock heads wish that you could

Be a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldier

Now let's get one thing straight, my weapons are great
You 22 automatic suckers are late
Got a quarter Moon clip, and a Smith and Wesson
I'm about to give you roody-poos a cold gun lesson
I'm the wizard of mayhem, master of destruction
Got a 44 mag, with the blunt instructions
Page 1 says open, page 2 says feel
Page 3 says cock, page 4 says kill
A mini 14, full combat dress
A thirty round clip, and I ain't takin' no mess
Cause I'm a rough eyegrasser, a camouflage dresser
My M16 has a flasher presser
My Sterling mark six , it's funny but it hits
It looks sideways but the sucker will kick
A pack of dangerous beretta, kinda small but its good
Some of you wannabes wish that you could

Be a hip hop soldier
I'm a hip hop soldier

Now I'm about to get go, so I better clean up
I'm not avigatin' crime, but you gotta get tough
I don't believe in gun control, the theory is proven
Give a criminal a gun, and your public is losin'
For you gotta fight back, cause the pigs ain't black
No protection in your section, now it's time to act
A 22 won't due, you need rapid fire
I'm a ammo gum gun buyer
Big battle rifles, can make a suckers day
You mess around with me so lot, you might get blown away
Wearin' 5 gold rings, never intimidated
In Seattle they are jealous, cause a brother has made it
But they don't mess with me, cause they might get Iked
I'm not a gay rapper, I don't like to get knifed
The devil made me do it, and I wannabe good
Don't you roody-poos wish that you could

Be a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldier ...

I'm runnin' hollow point bullets, in my 38
So if you plan to get ill, you better stay in your place
Cause I'm not a game player, I'm just a rhyme sayer
My vigilante group includes my mayor
I pack two uzis cause they stop all crime
You might get yours, but don't let me get mine
I never beat woman, romance is better
If a freak wants to leave, boy you might as well let her
West coast rappers we all bust hard
When we chillin' on the set, we never need a bodyguard
People in Seattle hate me, cause I'm not like a hood
Some of you wannabes wish that you could

I looked straight in your eyes and I sing, ""Let's do it!""
But you didn't even care, oh girl!

But now we're all alone
And you're looking oh-so-fine
I like to whisper my two things in your ear
And try to blow your mind, baby doll, oh!

Put your head up on my chest
Feel the pounds of my heart
Rest assured once I lay my foundation
We would never fall apart, girl!

These crowds are paths that haunt me at night
Call them romantic dreams
But it's so realistic I toss and I turn
And I wake in a sweaty scream, ah!

A romantic interlude  [x5]

While driving I was thinking, as you slept in my lap
I was thinking of the things we could be doing, baby
Back at my flat, you know what I mean? Oh!
The sun was rising, I had driven all night
And be weary at the wheel

I looked down at you while you were sleeping
Your beauty seems so unreal
You open your eyes and said, ""Mix-a-Lot's hours of sleep
Because you are on my mind
Why don't you search for my hidden treasure
There's no telling what you'd find""

By this time I was tripping, girl
You're such a tease
But it was love, baby, not a one night stand
You're not a sleaze, girl, oh!

A romantic interlude  [x4]

You woke up with a worried look on your face
Something was on your mind
You got out of bed and walked towards the window
And stared through my venetian blinds
You would turn and look at me
As you stood wrapped in lace
I crept up behind you and held you tight
And a tear ran down your face, oh baby!

You said, \""Now you got what you want!
Don't you want to leave?\""
I said before it's love, girl, not a one night stand
You're not a sleaze, ah!

That frown soon turned to a smile!
You realized I was deep
Deep in love in the holistic sample of sophistication
In other words, my freak!

I knew this song's a hard bit too
But the test song's full of grief
Making songs full of heartbreaking regret
It's not my belief, girl
To see your smile is all I want
Your tears I exclude
The next time you see me you crave, whatever!

Tickle her fast, until she starts to cry
Whip her to the left, whip her to the right
But don't whip her to hard cause her jeans are tight (look good)

Now before we end this filthy cut, we got a few things we have to say
To the home girls sprung on the hum drum beat, check out Sir Mix-A-Lot Ray

(Peek a boo)
This is the true story about a young lady I know
(Peek a boo)
A walkin' zombie, product of the system
(Peek a boo)
Now she's play a game by her own rules
(Peek a boo)
The peak a boo game

[Verse 1]
Deceptive, her game is in the thick lane
Pick up tips, while you cause some pain
Hundred dollar bills, pot bellies on the prowl
Pick up your shirt to work is fly but foul
A nympho, I don't know but she can dance though
Start the show her system says go
Naked on the stage but lovin' the pay
Peek a boo is the game, the pure never play

[Chorus]
(Peek a boo) The peep show
(Peek a boo)
(Peek a boo)
(Peek a boo)

[Verse 2]
She's seventeen, but claims to be eighteen
Boss on the tip in the back they do the wild thing
Sayin' please won't get this sleaze to skease
Goes this skease only G's for fees
Only works late, downtown 1st and Pike
Yours for the night, if the money's right
She's a stripper, an Avenol sipper
Down with the zipper, cause nobody wants to kiss her
She's the peek a boo pro, yeah you know
Sportin' high heels and swimsuits, dancin' at the strip show
Used to have a real name now they call her Cocoa
Cocoa went loco so they paid to see her solo
Dancin' on the stage, crowd's a rage
They fill up the garter belt to keep the girl paid
It's a trip cause the girl's clockin' dollars with her hips
Like a ape doin' flips for gratuity tips
Such a shame she's lookin' up the deep throat fame
A porno queen with a plastic name
Hot black babes meet chocolate men
That's the peek a boo game and you know the end

[Chorus]
(Peek a boo) - 4X

[Verse 3]
Girls, girls, girls flesh for sale
But you ain't worried cause your pimp puts up the bail
That's the game, table dancin' led to prostitution
Payin' some punk to avoid prosecution
Sleepin' with cops, chasin' jocks
Twenty dollars a knock, now your smokin' the rock
You started out topless, but tricks want the bottom
Then the rock man got 'em
Rolled you, sold you, then the punk told you
Get on the strip, get me paid or I'm a fold you
Your sellin' yourself, but you say your just a stripper
Your mother's at home, alone, but you forget her
Never mind, your contemplatin' a suicide
Trippin' on black tar, trapped and you want to hide
Strippin', but they would get you through college
Girl you know that whacked out game, ain't solid
But you chose it, and you got stuck wit it
Jump on a table for a dollar a minute
Gamble with AIDS when you ramble
But the Mobil's got your mind all scrambled
Bandits, but the song just a canvas
I paint a picture of life, cause some demand this
From here to Japan, freak show for pay
Peek a boo is the game your daughter just might play

[Chorus]
(Peek a boo) - 4X

[Verse 4]
Now your big time, lookin' up to Hoochieoni
Your butt got bigger, your fingernails phony
Dollars for dames it's a game full a sellouts
I know your name, so I'm qualified to yell out
Baby, seventeen wit a child
Strippin' for perverts and drivin' 'em wild
But there's a man in the back, red eyes and a hat
He wants more than a dance, and a sit on the lap
He wants you Cocoa, he's gone crazy
He thinks pain is a pleasure for a lady
Why? Because your dancin' like a bimbo
Touchin' yourself, makin' love to a pencil
He's hot, turned on, wants to beat your brains out
And he'll pay if you let him just plain out
Beat you, like your some kind a pet
And yo wit it Cocoa, did you forget?
There's a killer on the loose, nickname Green River
Creative with the knife and a young girl's liver
Elusive, smooth, never been spotted
Lookin' for a girl with a Jones and you got it
Cash, the root of your sin
Opportunity knocked but you were never in
But now it's over Cocoa, forever you will sleep
it off, it all started when your father took a peek

Suckers gettin' mad, swift kick, broke rib
Serve it in a dish, name it up, rib-tip
Metal in the front, big stomp, crush neck
Punks on tip, call the boots, GoreTex

Laugh if you want, but you might get crushed
Walk through the dangerous Hilltop brush
Bullet-proof, steel-toed, down to kick butt
Roughin' up character who drop weak cuts
One twenty five was the price tag on 'em
Cool brothers buy 'em, even though they don't want 'em
Style is a must, but the style is rough
China Beach boots couldn't crush more stuff
Strap 'em down, lace 'em up, get in the bucket
Reach for the tongue, pull it out, then tuck it
Ten pound boots could destruct all comers
My whole posse wears them Fort Lewis runners

Death to a white pair of nikes           - sound effect
Kickin' over big motor bikes             - sound effect
Steppin' over puddles in the hood        - sound effect

Pulverize punks when we throw            - sound effect
Salute to the group in the booths        - sound effect
Bow, and we kick you in the snoot        - GoreTex

Hollow-point nine, to the boots, ricochet
Leavin' mud prints when I romp in the rain
Draw black scars on the new gym floor
Pimps like to wear 'em when they kick them whores
This is it baby, big shiny black boots
Runnin' over punks like Iranian troops
Trample, crush, hittin' like a dump truck
Jump in my face and a size twelve get stuck
In your butt, 'cause you wanted to box
One-two punch and the GoreTex drops
On your toe, your brother got caught
By GoreTex boots from the GoreTex shop

Git it!

Tightly knit, my script is legit
I'm force feedin competition, more rebel shit
Rhymes on a roll, cold yet bold
I did ""Posse on Broadway"" in cruise control
Runnin like a wart, rap's my sport
Of course loss, and then you pick the part
But don't cry and say you wasn't warned
Cause my voice keeps comin like a STORM
Bass should it be let go, heck no
Want to be hard, cause you failed to be techno
Rugged, ripped and rough hittin like ""Thriller"" (boom)
My bass drum is a killer
Packed like a musket, tough to test it
Your arrested (Yo, was he in a trial?), you guessed it
His eyes are big, his crew ran away in the crunch
Then I hit 'em with the ""Batman"" punch
Laugh, if you want but don't approach 
Cause most that approach get ate up like toast
But some do come, you want to scrap or what?
If not stay back, cause I'll Roll You Up

Not dressed to impress, but dressed for pain
No cute sweatsuits, just sweat and chains
Step off strapped, I let off caps
Ha, Hitchcock couldn't write more wicked raps
Rip the Godfather, then you start that braggin
I never jumped on a James Brown bandwagon
A malla ralla, makin MC's holler
My rope's so big, your girl's callin me a baller
Bad is played, so I choose to use mean
Diabolical mind, the remorse is unseen
Quick to cut on any concert quack
Lip-synchin rhymes off a raggedy tracks
He claims to hate me, swears I can't beat 'em
I drop a new jam, the punks come like I beep 'em
Tried to jack, stepped up and got popped
Cause I'm takin out scum like ""Robocop""
Twistin off rhymes in a lyrical knot
The temporary, interuptin in your chain of thought
It's me so give it up, cause the gat is in your gut

Roll him up, cause he's soft, kinda limp
I'm your worst nightmare, a sucker MC's pimp
Workin 'em hard with my hip hop force
My words so cold they known to freeze up warts
The scope is focused, notice no hocus pocus
Your girl's a square, but she'll tell ya I'm bogus
Saw you on the street, your middle finger was flippin
And your the victim of a drive-by lyrical whippin
Read my song, lyrics are strong
The critics were wrong, I kind to suckers like pong
aggression the lesson, pain is the ultimatum
Reachin and grabbin, hittin like Jack Tatum
They are crushed, turnin suckers to slush
Heavyweight beef for you punks that fuss
Whippin like handball, punishin the face
I'm all up in 'em like Section Eight
Logical rhymes, ahead of the time
Goin for mine, and fight time, still down to grind
Here's the white chalk, your next to get cut
But cross the white line and I'll Roll You Up

In the Pacific Time Zone, I'm considered the boss
A lyrical nightmare, it's me in your dreams
Feel the sweat, the smoke, get up and then scream
Loose is the noose, but I'm tightenin soon
My drum's steady hung, with enormous boom
I stomp all comp, for it's you I romp
My drum's kickin harder than paternity stomps
Hit it and with it, the posse's heavy and stiff

Caddy was back but my Benz was in his face
Left toward South Shore, wrong way homey
This street's for Mix-A-Lot's posse only
Looked in his mirror saw my big gold grill
Ain't no place to run so you might as well chill

I'm living like hell in a world of death
Protectors of the people wear bullet-proof vests
Your little nephew, flipped him a Uzi
Took to the streets, shot em up and then ""Who me?""
Locked in a trunk by Republican villains
Pinstripe suits, experts at killin

Trapped in a box called the ghetto we shout
Headin for the strip 'cause the squares ain't hip
Sell a couple keys, make the home boys trip
The president is a dope man's friend
The governments strong but the dope got in
Punish the accused, but the trial was short
A black man's dogged in a all white court
The jury dismissed, prosecutor says, ""Can em""

Verse Two: Sir Mix-a-Lot

The pentagon had a plan for a rescue
They said intelligence never makes miscues
The thirty-first was a day of death
Lieutenant Colonel Higgins, you know the rest
No negotions with a terrorist force

The Ayatollah's dead but the hearts not gone
The burning of the flag in Iran goes on
Anti-American, we're loved by few
We pay big money to the ones that do
The christian militia, they give us big knowledge
But the pentagon messed up and wouldn't acknowledge
Ollie took orders from the number one man
But the crap hit the fan and superiors ran
Democrats tripped, the committee said can em

Verse Three: Sir Mix-a-Lot

Am I a communist? No. But my brain ain't slow
Not long ago, Mix-a-Lot was po'
Never helped out by the ones with clout
I was mad at the world cause I felt left out
Stealin hub caps, stereos, anything to get paid
I realize I'm a modern day slave
Posse downtown, the sight was set
I saw my home boys mother with a buggy and a bag
People walk by, laughin at poverty
I looked in her face and I soon saw me
College educated, but she can't get a job
The american dream once again got robbed
Vietnam vets on the street, that's a shame
Fight for the man, and the man plays games
Dogged by the hippies, dope smokin' critics
You blame it on the soldier, but your government did it

Started with a key, clocked 17 G's

You want to ride, better dust off your dress""
I ain't dissin you .. skees
But my Benzo's the ultimate tease
Walk into the Spectrum, some suckers want to kick my rectum
Got up in my face, tellin me I was deaf
I slapped the boy cause he had bad breaf
Looked down had his rope I saw VNLW
What you tryin do, you dumb brother you
Call yourself a baller in a Volkswagen
You better hush homes and squash that braggin

(Yo what's up Mix, I got a Benzo too)
(Could I say something?)
There's something about my Benzo
(Haha, yeah)

I ain't no pimp but I'm ""Bad to the Bone""
Cellular phone in the middle
So many buttons on my dash, it's a riddle

Grill's dirty from the birds I'm killin (Got 'em)
Girls please step back don't touch this
The kinda car jack artist don't mess with

It's time to go, too many skirts want sex

(That's what I'm sayin)
There's something about my Benzo
(Oh yeah, that's right, sing it Mix, sing it)

Bought it in Miami, rode it to Cali
Hit 150, through the Fernando Valley
AMG down with the big gold grill
Tack jumps when it's time to get ill
15-inch woofers, boom in the trunk
""Posse on Broadway"" for maximum bump
Cruise like Deletho, playin my rhyme
Rewind the tape kid, that's the wrong line
Back to the car, automatic on the floor
Points with the skirts bought a Benzo, scores
Whole gold shot, that includes gold mirrors
The wipers on my lights make the word a bit clearer
Whip, dip, munchin barbeque chips
Honkin at pimps at these flip for the tip
Roll up on baby I said ""aight, a-a aight""
Some old player riffin of big old players day
Baby dropped her vanity workin that makeup
Wavin at her friends, thinkin she's a taker
But I let it slide
You use me for the ride, I use you for the high
You know what's up, that's the way the game rolls
Use me I use you, and so the story goes
Ho pimpin on pimpin, the chant the homies scream
Bring them skirts to the Benzo king

A ha haha, yeah
Just something about my Benzo

Not just one, I got three
I collect 'em you see
SEL, a 190, and a SEC
I ain't no dope man Mr. Lolly jump on TV tryin to diss
Brothers like you hate to see black success when it's legit
But it's real, check the latest Vibe
Sixteen nahs, and the reader make it five
CD, cassette, big amps make it rock
Turn that AC off girl it's a drop top
SEC, hog of hogs
Hit the funky street lights when I'm rollin in the fog
Cruisin at a 100 when I spotted this car
It was a trap .. they call it radar
State Trooper in a 5.0
Will he catch my SEC, now you know
Gunnin 130 on the outskirts of Seattle
Ha, that's the end of that battle

Yeah, I want to say what's up to all you brothers rollin in Benzos
Eazy-E, Ice-T, Tone Loc
Word, there's something about my Benzo, peace",Something About My Benzo
Sir Mix-A-Lot,"Oh, my, God.  Becky, look at her butt
It is so big, she looks like
One of those rap guys' girlfriends.
But, ya know, who understands those rap guys?
They only talk to her, because,
She looks like a total prostitute, 'kay?
I mean, her butt, is just so big
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there
I mean gross, look
She's just so, black

I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waste
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, want to pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I want to get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But with that butt you got makes (Me so horny)
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you want to get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen her dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat, wet,
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas (Yeah) Fellas (Yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah)
Tell 'em to shake it (Shake it) Shake it (Shake it)
Shake that healthy butt
Baby got back (L.A. fits with the Oakland booty)

Baby got back (L.A. fits with the Oakland booty)

I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I want to get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I want to get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I want to fuck
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies (Yeah) Ladies (Yeah)
If you want to role in my Mercedes (Yeah)
Then turn around, stick it out
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back

Baby got back
Yeah, baby, when it comes to females
Cosmo ain't got nothin'
To do with my selection
36-24-36
Ha ha, only if she's 5'3""

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers want to play that ""hard"" role
And tell you that the butt ain't gol'
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that
'Cause your waste is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down,
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!

Baby got back!

So I took a one-year hiatus
Ain't nobody heard my latest
You thought Mix-a-Lot was through
But I'm back; this boot's on you
What happened to all the old homies?
When the money gets funny it's lonely
My ex turned into a slut
Down at the Hollywood, slangin' that butt
Cheap perfume and a mini-skirt
Girl, what's your line of work?
Now that I'm rollin', you want to roll with me
But have you been to the clinic lately?
Yesterday you had six condoms, see
Today you got three
Tossed you out like a paper sack
This brother ain't Sprung On The Cat
What about all the old homies?
I got paid so they call me phony
But I refuse to lay it low,
When a brother like you tells me I can't flow?
So here we go, bro, the leader of the Flow Show
Let you know, I roll and get mo'
I yank the bank and I ain't been ganked
Cause my back you're trying to shank, but no thanks!
My face shows pain and strain as I stand in the rain
With this fame, you go insane
The game I run is not fun to some,
And now I love no one!
The boss is back!

{Big boss in effect, I ain't bluffin'!} I'm back!
Your boss is back!
{Big boss in effect, I ain't bluffin'!}

Tommy wants revenge
But I want your oxygen
When the game got thick you ran
Now in my face you stand
Beggin' for a few hun?
Son, your fun meets my gun!
Now you scream you're true black
Boy, you need to chill with that!
Cause I'm an e-qual op-por-tu-ni-ty de-stroyer
My gat's my lawyer
Last week you's a stick-up kid
And this week you're in show biz
Standin' on stage, another black want to-be
want to get paid, so you're as balck as you gotta be
Throw up a peace sign, fakin' the rhymes
Run out of lyrics, scratch in a Malcom X line
Hypocrite, your hits break the bits
The boss of brain lays pain when I spit
Criticized, cause I'm takin' the dares
And now you're tryin' to tell another brother what to wear?
Come off that tip, you know how it goes
Another brother gets shot and punks blame it on gold
Gold ropes?  Naw, that ain't your problem
The job of a rapper is to find em and solve em
Now you're crying bout what a brother owns
King died so you could buy your throne
I ain't got time to take steps in reverse
You or the KKK, who's worse?
You told me to stay low in my ghetto
And so did the Klan, so wake up, bro
Why do you think brothers is sellin' dope, fool?
America, boy, the bankroll rules!
Play that hard role and say you ain't with that
And everything you're cryin' bout money on your contract
Talked about me bad, it's time for the payback, black,
The boss is back!

{Boss} I'm back.

I don't know the meaning of trust
I gotta live so I do what I must
Some girls'll cross you when you're soft
That's why I'm my own damn boss
They'll run you down with stress
If you're spring on the butt and chest
I'd rather be sprung on the ducat
And put another damn freak in my bucket
I deal with women, not girls
Cause them young ones'll shake your world
I'm tellin' it like it is
Cause a brother like Mix ain't losin' his
I got about two or three clowns
That try to kick me when I'm down
But when I come up, they all play dumb
All of a sudden, it's we, not one
I zip up lips when I spit these hits 
I'm equipped to make misfits quit
Young bucks should all duck cause jaws are gettin' struck
The luck gets chuched, so wussup!
I ram and cram my jams in the mouth of a man
I'm kickin' quicker than Van Damme
Face the facts, two platinums stack
Step off, fool, or get cracked!

Sir Mix-A-Lot,"What's wrong, sweetheart?
Don't you want me?  
You paid for me.  kneel to me.
Smoke me.  breathe me.  inhale 
Ha ha ha ha ha ha, I'm your new god.

She's only sixteen, she looks lost
Bought crack from the dopeman, and got tossed
Livin' on the streets, smoked out
Perfect individual for me to bust out
You can sniff me, or you can puff me
But the girl shoulda known, you can't trust me
She's only ninety eight pounds and lonely
She calls to her god for help, and that's me
Cocaine, go ahead n' use me, heh heh
Momma won't know you're a junkie
Just put me in your pipe, light and suck
Cluck cluck cluck!
And while you're high, grab a twelve gauge
Jump back on the streets, in a crack rage
The only way out is the suicide route
Put the gauge at your dome and take it out
Now I'm on the six o'clock news
All my movies get the rave reviews
60 Minutes had a special on me
The god called crack is killin' your society
Colombia is where I get picked
I can kill with a ninety-ten split
I work through the week, my pleasure is pain
And I'm your new god
You can call me cocaine

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Cocaine
Heh heh heh
Go ahead n' smoke me

Brothers throwin' up a set to protect me
I'm worth a lot so money so respect me
Doin' damage on the boulevard, just like that 
Shoot 'em over crack
Dope dealers would kill for me
'Cause if ya sell me, I help ya live lovely
You want a Porsche?  move a few ki's 
Just remember that your god is me
The task force bum rushed one of my employees
A big score, twenty three keys
Now ya see another dopeman sink
And one young cop on the brink
The cop's thinkin' bout pinchin'
And alimony checks to his wife for the rent and 
Kids, so the profit is slow
And he wants to make his bankroll grow
Twenty three just sittin in the back seat
I can make the best man weak
So the cop hits the streets to sell a little pain
Now the cop has a god
You can call me cocaine

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Cocaine
Smoke this
Smoke it
Smoke it

The only way I can be stopped is with intelligence
And you don't get it, so that's irrelevant
So you die, or else go to jail
And I'm happy as hell
I tried to get a young kid but he just said no
Because of some sports hero
So I entered the hero's house in the form of a line
And let him snort one time
Now he'd dead, cause my dose was pure
Got him too quick for the cure
So the headlines read, ""dope made another hit""
Dead on the first sniff
Now the kid is lookin' for another hero
I let him know the other fool was a zero
He hits the streets, lookin' for a remedy
They introduce him to me
I don't need another junky, just a flunky
Besides, the little punk was spunky
So I put him in a fresh pair o' Dickies
Give him a beeper, and let him terrorize the city
Put him in a gang, teach him to slang
Another young punk deep in the game
He'll be lucky if he lives til' eighteen
And I'm his new god
You can call me cocaine

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Cocaine
Go ahead n' use me
Smoke me

Sir Mix-A-Lot,"""In this country a man's home is his castle""

I've been jacked by the racist scum, and here I come
Klan, run 'cause revenge is fun! And I'm that one
To make you tap dance with a shotgun
On Donahue they said they had weapons
Just to teach black people one lesson
But I ain't goin' to your school of fools
So come here, and look at my tools!
You can meet and greet the Glock 19 in your nostrils
I'll splatter your dreams
Plans to overthrow are left in limbo
'Cause one loco bro chose to dispose of you
And your skinhead crew
I ain't a house nigga with a twenty-two
I dump a hollow-point slug in your windpipe
Try to breathe believe the hype
'Cause this ain't the jungle fool
And I don't throw spears, and I ain't leavin' here!
A Nazi and you ain't never seen Germany
But you was lookin' for a enemy
So you found a young brother with cash
Crashed my glass, snatched my whole stash
Boy I'ma getcha back, like it ain't no thang
Show you what I learned from the gangs
Stack 'em up deep in a six-nine Deuce
Long range scopes for the whole damn group
Hangin' outside a club called Moonshine
Waitin' for the right time
There he is, walkin' in the Levi's blue cut
The Wicked One dropped two shots in his butt
I can't solve racism with a gat
But this is where my head's at get 'em with a jack back!

""You ask me the niggers around here
been treated awful bad for a long time""

I've been sayin' this, I gotta fix 'em
I want to fix 'em with a crucifixion
Nail 'em to a cross and burn 'em
Burn 'em burn 'em burn 'em!
It's been said that this would happen
Skanless skinheads jackin
All up in the crib insult for takin' my force
I had to break North
The leader had a spraypaint can
And on my wall wrote, 'Death to the black man'
Burned a cross in front of the hideout
Hopin' they could get my race to die out
I'ma 'cause 'em pain, physical and mental
I speak slowly through the temple
The Wicked One is talkin' trouble
Blastin' skulls into pieces of puzzle
Damage 'em so bad, they can't stop me
Not enough body left to get an autopsy
Skinheads, stakin 'em out
Bloodshed, takin' 'em out
Caught one of 'em, Mix said, ""Go ahead""
Thirty-eight, straight to his forehead
I hit 'em hard and it hit the spot
I punish and plot with Mix-a-Lot
Now where's the leader at? Gotta get him back
Gotta get the gat, gotta get the axe
Call it a revengeful murderous pact
Call it the jack back!

""Some things are worth killing for""

They burned a cross in my yard, caught a brother off guard
But I can't cry, 'cause I'm hard!
They jacked another black, but this black wants payback
I rack up killin' stats!
Now I'm on the hunt with a 12-gauge pump
Massive hardware's in my trunk
Creepin' low and slow
There's one roll down the window
What's up, fool?! (""No!"") buck buck buck
It ain't done til the punk stops breathin',
Watch Kunta Kinte get even!
It goes like that when a brother stays strapped
Couldn't get a job so I learned to rap
Livin' kinda large and the skinheads hate me
Run up in my house and they tried to take me
Now I got the metal to his dome
A Desert Eagle, dipped in chrome
I got a black stocking cap yanked over my face
Anger is takin' rationality's place
Hitler's in the house and I'm takin' him out
He shouts but the barrel's in his mouth
Before I shoot, he wants to know if I'm white or black
I yank my mask this has been a jack back!

""These boys were trained activists""

I'm not a slave but the Ku Klux Klan
And the Aryan Nation say I am!
What's behind the skinheads out to getcha?
The reincarnation of Hitler
Now I got a murderous attitude
I'm in a put 'em in a casket mood!
Remember the days of slavery?
They hung many black men from a tree
We fought to be free real hard
And the black man's freedom must not be scarred!
Callin' me an African Sambo
But after this, ""American Psycho""
And I'll smoke any skinhead racist
With the black glock that's in my fist
And the morgue'll be packed in body stacks
Memories due to the jack back
Caught the leader of the skinhead clan
You know the one with the spray paint can
Drilled him with a crowbar die!
In the left ear, out the right eye
Then I took a knife to his chest
Carved a wicked message in a bloody mess
It was a warning for the rest of his pack
""This nigga got him with a jackback!""",The Jack Back

Lockin' up jaws, MCs pause -

Lay down gats and get your weak knees walkin'
You ain't allowed to speak 'cause you've reached your peak
The elite don't get with the weak
Shut up, 'cause I'm burnin' this cut up
Boy, don't try to run up
'Cause I chop up crops
A weak hip-hop boy tried to jock my spot and he flopped
He went down to the concrete ground
I'm a hound when I get down
And I'm back, the mack with a lyrical knack
To pack sacks and never pay tax
And when I leave they diss me
Knowin' they can never get with me

'Cause they're runnin' around like ants, tryin' to grab their pants
That shit don't make you dance!
What's this beat doin'?
Leavin' your posse ruined
Stuck my fist in his mouth
Caught him on a whole shout
No pity on the lyrically weak
Face defeat, retreat, but don't speak
'Cause I ain't through, fool
And you ain't true to the Mix rules!
You try to flow so you go for what you know
But yo, bro, you ain't the flow pro
(Ohh!) I can't go slow
Gotta grow 'cause I want to get mo' dough
Full blown, bad to the bone 
And known to get it on with a microphone, homes

Your host on the coast is known to boast
And roast most that choose to get close
Put 'em in a lyrical knot
My spot: the number one slot
But I gotta have beats 
When I lyrically de-feat the weak that try to compete
Get 'em up, if you want to go head-up
What up?  Do as I instruct, black
'Cause my gat is jack-backed 
And lookin' at your baseball hat
I rolled over that mess you stole
And took control, and then broke the mold!
Now here I stand, boss man
The NorthWest tip is where I am
And I'm runnin' this work like dope
Shippin' it in planes, trains and boats
Up the charts I go
Steppin' on toes and throwin' low bolos
My group is large, and hard
No need for a bodyguard
We flex, rippin' off MCs' necks
Run 'em into Critical's pecs

I don't hit 'em, I just want to stick 'em
So I pull baby girl to the side
She said she likes my car
I said take a ride
So we flipped up the doors on the Contach
But gettin' in a Lamborgini is hard
So I grabbed baby girl by the rear end
I thought she might need help gettin' in

'Cause Mixalots bumpin' them headrests
She got booty for days
Other brothers is pullin' up
But she ain't phased
'Cause I laid my game like a concrete slab
She's the kinda skirt a mack gotta have
Rollin', showin' her off
'N some fool tried to call me soft
He's in a one nine seven two skin head caddy
A old superfly mack daddy
So my girl stepped out 'n he tried to mack
But she ain't havin' that
You see your game is weak, G
My girl, I ain't slappin', I'm mackin'
'N rappin'

Sir Mix-A-Lot,"""the police, urge people, to keep their guns locked up and unloaded""
""congress today, seems on the verge of approving gun control""

It's, time to fight back cause the new jack black macks
Ain't did shit about that, whack, jackin'
And I'm packin'
'Cause I'm down for the bank I'm stackin'
And in a straight up brawl I'll mall alla y'all
Ya try to crawl for Tylenol and I install
Big fists in your face, the blow is well placed
Spray 'em with mace in case mace is his taste
Throw up the dogs, the competition is fogged
'Cause he was smokin' the yang, iced and drink the 8-ball
Drunk, stumblin', threw him with the lean
I sweep him, then attack the spleen
Play the congas on his backbone
He's funk baritone until I twisted his dome
Creep up on my house and try to roll me up?
And got stuck in the gut with a black, Glock
And he starts to wobble
Self-defense is what I'm claimin', let's squabble
I pick up a pipe to take plenty of quick swipes
One grazed his dome and sliced his eye whites
I don't give a damn bout a stupid ass burglar
It's all circular
The dope dealer sells dope to the dope smoker
The smoker breaks in and tries to choke ya
But I ain't the one to run from ya son
This is my house, and it's fulla guns!
I'm down for mine and my choke is nice and hard
When you jack the boss there ain't no holds barred!

No holds barred
No holds barred
No holds barred

I'm crushin' most hoods like katie-dids(?)
I'm pleadin' guilty for the damage I did
This ain't about random violence
The (?) crept into my house, fuck silence
Now most punks want to run for the stun gun
Fuck a stun gun, I got the big one
Forty-four mag, automatic, chrome
Mercury-tipped bullets, melt the dome
It's the 1990's, and crack is
Talkin' to the criminals, ever so subliminal
Some crackhead wants mix-a-lot dead
A jack move instead, another fool bled
I can't cry cause my tears are nearly froze
My interior's cold, it possess my soul
I'm on the paranoid tip
And each of my socks got a clip!
When my house got robbed, a top notch job
Cops laughed while my mom just sobbed
9-1-1 only works for the rich ones
So I collect guns!
So step right through if you're down for the wrong move
Most crews are moved by my twelve gauge boom!
How can I love when I gotta
Protect my neck from a punk suspect?
Gun control - I ain't wit it
They banned the AK and any fool can still get it
The innocent have been beaten, bruised and scarred
But for this citizen, there ain't no holds barred

""it is an absolute infringement on my second amendment rights""
No holds barred
""when is this attack on gun owners going to end?""
No holds barred
""education, versus restriction""

Hypothetical situation
Gun control starts sweepin' the nation
Now you got a bunch of unarmed innocent victims
Gettin' fucked by the system
Sittin' at home with a butter knife, huh
Any fool could rape your wife
So what's up when the criminals can't be stopped?
The only one with guns are the cops
But it's hard for a brother to trust police
Huh, so the shit don't cease
So I go downtown to buy a hot gun
I hated criminals, and now I'm one
Because I bought a gat to protect my house
The cops want to bust me out?
So it's illegal to protect yourself?
Hell, you either get killed, or you in jail
So when you vote
You better think about what I just wrote
And fuck writin' a note to yo' congressman!
You got the fool hired
Now help get the fool fired
A scary scenario
And I put it in your stereo
So when a fool tries to run up on my car
R.i.p., no holds barred

No holds barred

No holds barred

Sir Mix-A-Lot,"I'm rollin' in a Nine-Oh van. California, that's my plan
Got memories Mixalot left in limbo, first stop Sacremento
Here we go, hit a club called Bentleys
Want a skirt to git wit' me, hit me
There's a girl with a back like a Cadillac
I walked up and got pushed back
Her boyfriend tell her I'm a play-a
Dropped salt on a dope rhyme say-a
My reputation offends this man
Next day hit Williamland Park
Creepin' like a shark
Spot a bad freak and I swoop like a hawk
""What up?"", ""Howya like to roll wit' a champ?""
""Please! All ya'll rappers is tramps""
My reputation is stoppin' my mission
Every freak in Sac is dissin'
Back on the four lane freeway
Next stop, the two-one-three, L.A.
The two-one-three is rough
But the Mixalot game is tough
Spot a young girl and I start that gamin'
Baby girl asks what set am I claimin'
""Just 'cause I rap, I gotta be in gang?""
It ain't a black thang, it's a rap thang
Censorship is sweepin' the nation
Messin' up a rap stars reputation

A rappers reputation, that's what I got

So I'm finished with the two-one-three
I knock, baby, but it's time to leave
Two days on the hard rock, boys is cruisin'
Interstate Ten, straight to Houston
They tell me 'bout the girls in the fifth ward
You know the boys must score
So we hit a fly club called Guchies
Lookin' for the skirts with the largest booties
Girlies in the club wasn't takin' no shorts
Showin' no remorse
For a brother like Mix, lookin' for the smooth
Didn't need a Houston skirt to get with me
But the nights still young
And the hunk ain't done
So we stepped to the van
Attitude's out of it
The next club, The Main Event
We never think about a dress code
Just step up in the club and let the game roll
But as soon as my boy Maharaji pulls up
Some punk starts runnin' up
He said you don't want to be with a rap star
They play you for your money and your car
Well my boy got crushed but the girl stepped off
With a rap stars rep, the girls are lost
""Hey yo, what's up, this is Mix I had to make a run
right quick, but leave your name and number 'n I'll
getcha right back, peace.""

So the posse left Houston Texas
All the girls keep callin' us sexist
Houston media is givin' us rappers no pity
So we all hit Kansas City
In K.C. we go The Gates and Suns
Gotta get grub 'fore we run
Met a little freak named Stacy
I said I'm not just here for the Barbecue baby
She gave me that look, like Pebbles
I'm acked with bass not treble
So I say, Oogley-goo oogley-doo-goo-doo
""What'd you say?"" I ain't tellin' you
You see the Mix game is laced with riddles
It ain't moaney, it's Mix in the middle
In walked my ex named Wendy
She got a fresh Dooney Bag
'Cause she's tired of Fendi
Oooh, could a brother be busted
Because Wendy trusted, Me?
An' ah told a lit'l lie 'n
Said I was a loyal guy
Wendy got mad and she wants to dis me
In Kansas City
Wendy starts to groovin'
Hands on her hips and her hair starts movin'
She said the Mixalot game is phony
Just 'cause I said I'm runnin' girls like ponies
But talkin' that stuff is my occupation
That's how I got this reputation

A rappers reputation, got a rappers reputation
Bring it on down. A rappers reputation, bring it back
A rappers reputation, that's what I got. A rappers
reputation, peace.",A Rapper's Reputation
Sir Mix-A-Lot,"[Mix-A-Lot] Yo Attitude (talk to me)
[Mix-A-Lot] We got some bustin ass marks out here
[Mix-A-Lot] Claimin some motherfuckin place they ain't never seen
 [Attitude] Huh, sellout
[Mix-A-Lot] Boy this is the S-E-A-T-O-W-N, clown
 [Attitude] Forever (Seatown)
 [Attitude] Yeah, and that's from the motherfuckin heart
 [Attitude] So if you ain't down witcha hometown, STEP OFF PUNK
 [Attitude] Mix, tell these fakes what the deal is

[Verse One: Sir Mix-A-Lot]
I was raised in the S-E-A-double T-L-E
Seattle, born in the C.D. nigga
19th and yes LeBorda(?) pimpin was hard
Caddillac was the car I wanted
And I got that seven-seven Coupe with the trues and straps
I couldn't roll no hubcaps, huh, it wasn't easy
Tryin to compete, with my homies in the C.D.
Here's my plan, funky-ass sedan
Laid down with the vogues, money in my hand
Hair all whipped up
Carload full of freaks with the butts
I used to cruise around Seward Park
Flip the funky eighty-one, and La Vista
Lookin for freaks to be G'd
Most mini-skirts wanted please
In them days boy you had to be pimpin
Just to keep motherfuckers from trippin
Now punks want to run up pokin
With a nine double-M, is you jokin?
Cause I'm packin - a HK-91 son
308's is what I run
A lot of clowns tried to take this town but they didn't
Huh, cause Seattle wasn't bullshittin

[Interlude: Attitude]
It ain't nothin but the real up in the Northwest (real deal nigga)
So don't step to the 2-oh-6 tryin to kick up dust
Or you might get floored, sucka (get FUCKED UP), think about it
This is from the Attitude Adjustor

[Verse Two: Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Do we got gangs?  Hell yeah, brothers gotta get paid
Mickey D's ain't payin no way
So they take to the streets with gats
And they'll put 'em on ya just like that
So I'm undercover, when I'm rollin through the C.D.
A lot of niggaz want to get me
I see a freak in front of Garfield, I swoop around the block
Gang of niggaz yellin out, ""Fuck Mix-A-Lot!""
Do I hate 'em?  Naw, I gotta love 'em
They think my head is big, and I'm tryin to be above 'em
Huh, but to the masses I'm just another coon
Gettin paid for a little bit of boon
So even though a lot of niggaz talk shit
I'm still down for the Northwest when I hit
the stage, anywhere U.S.A.
I give Seattle and Tacoma much play
So here's a shot to the Criminal Nation
And the young brother Kid Sensation
I can't forget Maharaji and the Attitude Adjustor
And the hardcore brothers to the West of Seattle
Yeah, Westside
High Pointe, dippin fo'-do' rides
And my homeboy Critical Mass in the back
With the bat to smack back all packs who try to jack me
Just because I'm in a S-E-see
Droptop A-M-G
The cops say Mix-A-Lot's a dope dealer
But I'm more like a dope deal sealer
I sell rap deals, not drug deals
Handin out contracts like meals
The Rhyme Cartel, I own the motherfuckin label
And Ricardo got the papers on the table
And I'm signin 'em, just like that
No sluts so my pockets stay fat
A lot of clowns tried to take this town but they didn't
Huh, cause Seattle wasn't bullshittin

 [Attitude] Huh, nigga this is MY town, what you talkin
[Mix-A-Lot] Punks tryin to tell me where I come from
[Mix-A-Lot] Who the fuck you talkin to, clown?
 [Attitude] Need to shut the hell up, Seattle Tacoma strong
[Mix-A-Lot] Shit, you was a young lil' rudy poot motherfucker
[Mix-A-Lot] 'fore you picked up a nine millimete
 [Attitude] Who you smokin?
[Mix-A-Lot] Punk-ass, cake, faggot ass nigga!

[Verse Three: Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Let's take a trip to the South end, we go West
Hit Reinert Ave and bust left
I'm in a funky-ass Porsche Gambala
No bitches, just women on my collar
S-E-A-T-O-W-N
Yo' nigga is back again
Huh, who you callin sellout fool?
I was puttin caps in clowns when you was still in school
But I choose not to talk about that
So many gangsta crews now, I'd rather kick back
So I drop my own style
Fuck bitin somebody else, and jumpin on a pile
But that's another subject, gettin back to the hood
Me and my boys is up to no good
A big line of cars, rollin DEEP through the South end
Made a left on Henderson
Clowns talkin shit in the Southshore parkin lot
Critical Mass is beggin to box
But we keep on goin because down the streets
A bunch of freaks in front of Reinert Beach, was lookin at US
They missed that bus, and they figured that they could trust us
Six cars in a line and the girls was fine
I had ""The Wicked One"" playin on my Alpine
Two Porsches, two Benzes, a Ferrari Testarossa
And a Rolls Royce roaster
Miami Vice tried to get with this, but they didn't

You done fell in love with the cat
You know what I'm talking about ""The Cat""
It'll get ya

Meow, meow, the cat will get ya
If you let it get wit' ya
Some brothers want to spend a lot a money
Just to get a little honey
But the honey gets runny when the money's funny
'Cause I'm hipped an' a brother like Mix don't slip
'Cause them girls will put that cat right on ya
And don't say I didn't warn ya
Go down to the beach

Wonder why you don't see me, brothers (yeah)
Should I preach (preach, preach)
Alright, back to the beach
A O-G from the hood
Went down to the beach but his game was weak
Met a sweet thing named Yolanda
She had the go mo-mo's on her brand new Honda
So my boy stepped up with a gangsta pitch
Better come on an' get wit' dis
A forty-dog in his hand and he's saggin'
But pretty soon the cat's go and tag him
Later that night, Yolanda got busy in the back
Of his big black Cadillac
The next day, the O-G wasn't playin' no ball
'Cause he took her to the mall
Buyin' everything from skirts to boots
Oh, speakin' a boots, yeah he knocked 'er boots
But in the end another fool got jack
'Cause he was sprung on the cat

Sprung on the cat, check it out

There's a brother named Dave in a Corvette
Had a job at the U-P-S
I ain't dissin' 'cause U-P-S pays money
But Dave wants to kick it with the honeys, huh
He shoulda got 'em a girl 'n' settle down
But Dave wants to get around
Put the top down on the 'vette
Hit the south side of Seattle
Lookin' for sex
Got a full pack of Sea grams under the seat
And boom, there it is three freaks
Thick, walkin' with a natural switch
And Dave starts getting that itch, huh
You know a 'vettes only got two seats
But Dave wasn't listening to me
All three of them jumped in the car
Hit Red Lobster and went straight to the bar
But them drinks ain't cheap out there son
Five dollars for one of them daiquiris
And Dave was treatin'
And the girls was sure 'nuff eatin'
Two hundred dollars worth of fish
And Dave wants to make a little wish
A little something that he'd seen in a porno movie
Play B-B-D and said do me
At Dave's house they left him in a cold sweat
He gave 'em the keys to the 'vette
Ooh, that's the wrong move, black
You must be sprung on the cat

Old girl named Joyce tried to put that cat on me two weeks ago
You mean she DID put that cat on you, you're talkin' to
Attitude, be straight with me man

I'm cruisin' incognito
Eight fifty I with the smoked out windows
An' I'm thinkin' I'm raw
When it comes to girls I done seen it all
Then along came a girl named Joyce
She had a black Corniche Rolls Royce
At the stop sign she did something with her tongue
Could Mix be sprung?
Her cat was calling me
And I started rolling slowly
Pulled up to the bumper
'Cause I wants to thump her
So she pulls up into Texaco
And I roll up slow and jump in the Rolls
Now I'm checkin' out the body
This hotty gotta body 'n' I want to get naughty
Followed her to the motel
Yes, motel, I'm too cheap for a hotel
Room deuce deuce deuce and it's time to get loose
I dipped in the juice
So what's up with the Rolls
Checked the registration
And the Rolls was stole
Baby girl tried to break with my keys and gat
But I ain't sprung on the cat

Don't pet the cat, if you just met the cat
If you're sprung on the cat
You might as well eat the cat

Take your sorry self over booth number 2 for the crack pipe
Yeah, alright. I got your crack pipe right here baby

Whoa, Louis Vuitton never made a sweatsuit
But you're swearin' up and down, that you got the Louie boots
So you roll to the swap meet, girlfriend buttless
Rip phantom top on your seven six Cutlass

Must resist temptation

Look at baby wiggle that big caboose
Got a little tiny waist, everything's in place

Nine months later, little baby pops out
Blonde hair, blue eyes, with her feets in her mouth
Well that can't be me (nope)
'Cause I'm a nappy haired black man, dressed like a O.G.
Angel's gold diggin, this girl's driven
Tryin to catch Mix on slippin

1977 was a no cocaine in my hood-ject
The brothers was stuck on Chuck without a mind set
I got tired of watchin ""Good Times""
feelin like J.J., I'm standin in the food bank line
My momma was ridin on the bus tryna get to work
Early in the morn', it's cold and her knees hurt
She got a .38 sittin in her purse
Cause my moms was the King County Jail nurse
So how in the hell could you tell Mix
That I never lived this, when you was just a snotty nose age six
Young buck, just graduate
And your lyin when you say your street educated
Cause I'ma veteran boy and you's a new booty
So stop frontin to your friends like you knew me
Cause you don't and you never did, kid
So FUCK your respect and the shit you claim ya did
To all ya real, when ya claimin ya gang bang
Doin everythin to gain fame and get yourself a name
But I done seen my homies gettin smoked over dice games
When you was still at home doin nice things
Back in the days of turtle wax on Cadillacs
Life to a brother was hoes and macks
I had to come up some way
Pimp daddies and ex-Black Panthers used to school me
Why moms was puttin in eight to twelve
I was in the hood gettin schooled on makin mail
I can't let my moms die a poor black sister
Gotta make her richer
So tell me what's real, partner

Back when MLK Way was Empire Way
I was stuck on broke, but I used to hear pimps say
Better get what you can get before you get got
Come up and snatch yours and buy yourself a nice spot
And that's stuck in my head 'til this day G
So I apply pimp game to life you see
But I ain't beatin on my sister in the streets
I'ma focus on my real enemy, yeah
So if I'm pimpin, then who's my hoeys
In D.C. livin in a big white house bro
Changes his name every four years
Mr. Carter caught me slippin, but Reagan wasn't gettin his
I never wanted a hand out young Jake
I never got jealous over how much a brother makes
So I was on my own, no love in the school zone
No blacks in the books, so I'm gone
And now the only color that I love is green see
Cause my history books never taught me about me
I may not like where I've been, but I'm lovin where I am
Prime rib, fuck Spam
So tell me what's real partner

But the simple fact that my pockets is fat
Means I can't relax, you know what I'm sayin?

[Verse 3 - Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Criticized by the main stream
For not bein the house jig and keepin things squeaky clean
But I can't, so I ain't
But I won't play the hard role just because you think
that is real, to say you kill, when you never held steel
You try to sing when you rollin in cake-ville
Back in the days you was breakdancin see
I remember when you had tight pants G
So Mr. Rap Critic when you trys to check me
about my cars and my girls, claimin you never could respect me
You really think I give a damn partner?
The shit I've been through man
I used to roll with the hoes
Hit the Caddy, slam the doors
Livin alone, cellular phone
Havin no furniture in my home
Rollin to Canada, makin my mail
Givin a trick a piece of tail
Livin it large, keepin it hard
Life was kinda odd
And rat a tat tat with my gat, sat in my lap G
The Hilton Hotel was my spot, I'm runnin my things see
I went from hustlin cheese, to double platinum LPs
But you still can't feel me
Boy the head don't get fat if you know where your at
Instead of ridin my back, check your own dat and that's facts
Now what's real partner

[Outro - Sir Mix-A-Lot - talking]
Haha, so what's real?
Yeah and all you clown runnin around town
Tellin people me and yous was down
When I was doin parties at the Boy's Club
You was sellin match books of weed, partner
I was about handlin my business
And you was about smokin your gri-nass
So check yourself, you want to see the big head champ
And that's real to the fullest and I'm out",What's Real

You want to play hard for your hood
Tell them how you whooped Mix-a-Lot's ass good
But what your homeboys don't know
I'ma let them know
If you ever want to squabble
I'ma crack your skull, bro
'Cause you need your narrow ass kicked
You little buster ass snitch
And I'ma say it once and never say it no more
You ain't hard 'cause you once sold-- dope
'Cause you was slangin' like a straight up bitch
Rolled over on your whole damn click
And you can't spell dirt
Let alone do none
Paid your homies, but your Mom is broke son
Now tell me who is a sell-out
I'ma read your ass on the spell out PUNK!
be	-E-E-A-A-T-see-H- a.k.a. is Mr. Jake
Little square ass mark boy, you ain't no gangsta----
You is a motherfucking Ainsta.

[Verse 2: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
First you want to sound like Ice Cube
Jumping on stage with a mic trying to mean mug fools
Now you want to be like Snoop
But you can't
Cause you fake with your shit, Nigga you and your crew
Bitch Motherfucker out of Woodinville
Faking just to get a little record deal
Used to try to rap like Chuck D
Ain't had a soul sister since I known you G
Huh
And that's real
Now ask your homeboys how they feel
And they will tell your ass the real
Scoop up your cats
With your fake gangsta ass
You could fool them for a minute
But that shit won't last
You sound kind of hard on your demo
But If your Mom and Dad heard it, they would beat your ass though
Cause you is a bitch made gangsta sap
Tellin' all these stories about your see through gat
Ever since I known you
you had one gat
But like a cluck motherfucker you sold that
Yeah
You wanted me to come real
Huh
Now you got your cat peeled beeaatch
And don't start frontin' bout your pimp game youngster
You fuck your own hoes like a trick ass busta
Learn the game brfore you claim it son
Study Hustlers 101
You's a motherfuckin Ainsta

(chorus:)

[Verse 3: Sir Mix-A-Lot]
What you did on the grind don't impress me
Four years of slanging and your pockets is still empty
And you say yu got street game
Need to buffalo your money like a baller man
But bitch made niggas get no love
I done seen your pictures with your fake ass mean mug
Kind of lookin' like a sweet thang
An old pretty motherfucker with a swap meet ring
Khakis nice and fit
looking like your punk ass at the Chevron bitch
Got your gut all bunched up
Shirt tucked in'
A forty in your hand with a stupid ass grin
Fake like a motherfucker
Swearing you is a player when your girl is with another sucker
But you won't cut her loose, cause you can't shake her
You is a motherfucking Ainsta

Take a look at this truck, got 'em sittin' on stuck
Drop down to the ground, with them big sounds
Four twelves in the back, 'til the windshield cracks

Scratch my back and you'll force me to dump

Get the coke white seats, fill 'em up with heat
Six three with the bows on feet
Peanut butter top to match the guts
Droppin' that butt, got 'em all sayin' ""what!""
Yellow back with a profile, what's up now
Gotta give me ten points on style
And the paint ain't trippin', drippin'
Look at this dippin', never caught slippin' or missin'
And in case you was doubtin' my pimpin' (what up fool)

One point two turbo burst
Let it ride like a black tech
Bettin' I'm gettin' my sex while I'm passin' up bets
Grab my horse by the reins and tame it
Watch where I aim it, so I don't flame it
I can't explain the insane left lane
Swing to the right, it's pain
Pass these busters, lookin' like lusters
Sittin' three deep in a dark blue Duster
Now I'm sittin' on cruise tryna get my food
Eggs and number one oh two and then popo spots me

Okay, 'Lik's gon' come anew for '9-6
Lead yo ass to the aqua, but I can't make a brother rich
You gotta go for self, and then help others
Mama wasn't lyin when she put you up on game, brother
All up in the house gettin loud and disrespectin
'Lik steps in, regulatin and hoe-checkin
All them makes wishes, ain't already tryin to sympathize
Players stay paid all day, but yo ass stays broke and high
Oh my, kids and stuff all over like some roller skates
Still I keeps it on my pape and niggas be tryin to playa-hate
But that'll get you rolled up sideways
Whoever said crime pays never got 3 strikes in L.A.
Makes you lonely, sayin, contributin to mines
You could be hella fine, but ain't nobody spendin mines
Mobbin with the Crowbar with some common sense
You can stay hella bent, I be at the water stackin presidents

One of these goddamn set-backs of havin your mail fat
Is some of these lax-ass want to-be macks, and you hoes in black
They tracks sound booty, and they ain't doin they duty
In the studio, and only if you knew me, though
You'd see that I puts in work, and puts hurt
On your flirts that want to wear skirts and try to jerk
But you'se in love with a fantasy, trick
You want to 'sit on yo ass, collect checks and shit'
You was younger than me, so I schooled ya
Gave you the tools to come up and get down like a ruler
Took you to executive brunches, high-powered lunches
Gave you dough in bunches
So get your fried chicken and your watermelon
Start the yellin, Mix-A-Lot is why you ain't sellin
Old Uncle Tom nigga gettin mad
But you know you never worked for the shit you had
Start drinkin, bitch

Handin out sugar daddy contracts to big black macks in black pimp Caddies

Rollin fat hoops and rollin gizzy stashin big loads

Got you a family, still you all up in mines
Fuckin off's the hot rule, but see, 'Lik gon' fit to be fine
She ain't right, got her shorties runnin the streets with retardation
Bein barely sleep, puttin on that sneaky dick in her
Boys will be boys, that's how the game goes
Ask Mix-A-Lot, they all hoes, and this player knows
Better bumrush school and get your G.E.D.
Cause welfare, homey, been cuttin back since '83
Two carts ??? and still be tryin to front
Use your diaper money to load up them philly blunts
Get a 9 to 5, change your whole mindframe

But some of my ex's ain't around
Why is that
Cause the rock man got them and their butt's just dropped
They started losing weight

I'm keeping, down and holding my crown and giving them hiccupps

She got an old V-Dub (Volkswagen) with the damaged exaust

And watch the 808 kick drum

I used to have this girl, let's say her name was Mona
Mona, fine young sugar comin out of Arizona
5 ft. 6 straight thick with a switch 
And a set of them juicy-ass lips (Mmh...)
Kinky, just like me
She can take a straight gee 
And put him down for the count 1, 2, 3
Needless to say I was kickin it
Cause I know when I'm the only one gettin it
But - ooh, things change when you don't maintain
The same game you got her with, mayn
Flew back home, and I was slippin
Cause as soon as I left, another brother starts spittin
Throwin drag about wantin a family
Tryin to front because he want to be manly
Tellin my girl how I'm playin the field
Boy, you'se a jake for real
Now a player I like, but you know I can't stand no snitch
Tryin to front like he rich
Done shot your credit, cause you bought you a new E 
320, and you want to be a hoe like me
Now you done salted my game
Told my girl I'm a player, and you bought her a ring
You paid a lotta money just to grab her
I'ma tell you like this, trick: you can have her

(You can have her)

[ VERSE 2 ]
I gotta do what I gotta do
Baby girl's through, so I need somethin new
You can't keep a good mack down
I get around cause I got a tight thing up in Sea-Town
5'9"" with dimples
Caramel skin, straight fine, hella tight, no pimples
Thinkin my game was concrete
But I gotta watch for them other entertainers and athletes
Especially the ones who want to settle down
Cause they'll beg and drink out your shoes and get they nose brown
Just the kinda man you wanted, ain't it, honey?
A big buff dumb-ass fool with hella money
Down to spend till his knees bend
Then the athlete's broke and his girl's in the wind
And my girl gets mad, cause I never spend time like I'm s'posed to
Plus I'm a boaster
Shaggin up too damn quick, now she's lookin for a sugar daddy
Just to get a '96 Caddy
A big truck she found
You young scrub on the bench for the Cleveland Browns
He never had nothin, thicker than a cheerleader
Now he got juice, so he eats her
And treats her to a big wad of cash
Too weak, so she left his ass
You can have her

(You can have her)

Just rollin by the Playboy Mansion...

I got me a, I got me a, I got me a, I got me a 
Young bunny, young bunny in La-La Land
want to get freaky with the papa man
I smack her to the front, I smack her to the back
I smack it with the whiffle ball bat, remember that?
One happy black man I be
When my L.A. bunny want to trip with me
Her name is Teresa
She was freakier than me, but I figured I could please her
She had the long braids
Chocolate sister, loved to cuff men like slaves
Arrived at the house at last
Seen two shades of lipstick on the same wine glass
Provocative artwork around me
Four pink slippers on the floor surround me
One pair's for her, the other pair's for who?
Plus she only lives in a one bedroom
Well hm - it might be on
Ménage-à-trois, open la bouche, taste la bomb
Teresa's roommate walks in
6 ft 2 with a wig and a stupid-ass grin
(Oh my goodness!)

You're my angel
You're the girl of my dreams

How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had tear drops in you eyes
Daddy's home, your Daddy's home, to stay

It wasn't on a Sunday
(Monday and Tuesday went by)
It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon

But I made a promise
That you treasure
And I made it back home to you

How I've waited for this moment

Sir Mix-A-Lot,"Men have died and shot folks for this game
All to get a rusty bucket of nails at the end of a platinum rainbow
No, game

[Chorus]
Some have died and some just lied with it (game)
Some have cried and others tried to get it (game)
Men have lied and lost their pride to get it
Told ya, game don't never get old (this game won't ever get old)

I got no kids because of it (because the game)
And I got no wife because of it (because the game)
But I got this life because of it
Told ya, game don't never get old

[Verse 1]
East Lessler Way, Apartment D, see thee bad memories
Used to be the, one with no TV
Take back my soul, stole by one of these foes like Mack Moes
Puttin holes in my old clothes, even stole my pose
Got my sky, fly, who that guy?
Slip 'em my third eye, falsified
Don't lie, break with a girl, you cry
If you wants game, slip me some change
But you must refrain, from saltin my name
Now your girl's at my door, I told ya bro
Salt me, I take what's yours, that's the rules though
The big leagues, how can game go outta style
Boy you foul, slicin game with a mean ass scowl
Young stud ..

[Verse 2]
Seattle to Diego, big black El Dorados, my saddle
So straddle papa and babble until dada raddles
Let game resume, I assume using my room to boom boom
If not leave soon, let me retune
Big saloon, says ""oh, oh, I'm so low""
My old enzo flows, hey two Diablos to go
But whoa, oh, but wait, oh
You can't be serious partner
You used to be scared of girls, now you smell like my imposter
I seen your chicky poster, fake pose, gun in holster
Your girl gets to me closer, tryna post up on the clothes-ac
You toast her, boast her, get you closer, gettin hitched up
Bitched up, whipped up, lost your strikes when you switched up

And I got no wife because of it

Men have lied and lost their pride to get it
Told ya, game don't never get old

[Verse 3]
So who's next to go pop face lock on my mack spot
heads drop when my cuts flop, don't stop please Mix, don't stop
I saw his game it ain't the same, so don't cry baby
Just sit by Mixxy, but dimed us cam D
So I stack my backpack (for the raps), going to Cali (comin back)
Tricks up my sleeve (look at that), sisters with me (who the mack)
I rolls with real bosses, cuts my losses in my office
Hot tosses, gettin steamy in these marinatin sauces
Now these young kids is in my gravy, hella lazy
But they paid see, doin things to raise me
They game's a little hazy, but it's cool
Pat, pack, rack your stack
He's back, put check your hat
And your style at the door black

And I got no wife because of it

Yeah don't grab the game bull by the horns
Cause these horns hit balls, you know what I'm sayin?
Tears roll down your cheek and freeze
Before they reach concrete

You graduate to stone

Sir Samuel,"Refrain x 2 : 
Je donne jamais du mou
La vie c'est pas gentillesse!
j'tend jamais la joue c'est ma devise pour progress!
C’est mental offishall,
Force et courage ti mal!!!!
 
Faire vivre mes rêves, y'a personne qui m'en n'empêche,
J’ai testé la vie avec ou sans anti-sèche,
Elle m'a rouée de coups et elle m'a rendu fou,
Elle m'a foutu le blues mais je suis toujours debout!
Sur la route des problèmes, moi j'étais en panne sèche!
Les yeux inondés et le coeur en sécheresse,
Face à moi même j'ai vu l'ampleur des dégâts!
Je voulais lâcher l'affaire avec le son plus d'une fois mais...
J’donne jamais du mou

Refrain x 2
 
La vie c'est la vérité et elle te test quand tu veux la tester!
L’amour faut le mériter, le cœur à vif , ça tu vas détester...
La vie c'est la vérité et elle te test quand tu veux la tester!
L’amour faut le mériter, le cœur à vif , ça tu vas détester...

C’est p't'être banal mais c’est comme ça que je progress,
J’apprends de mes erreurs, plus fat  sera le succès,
Alors au mic j’tiens l’coup , je veille et pare 
Les coups en solo ou en crew,
Nous on nous cherche des poux!
J’avance tête baissée dans ma vie dans mon business
Je suis pas à l'affût d'être le best of the best
Tant que la foule est réceptive et chante avec moi,
Tant que ma family me supporte avec foi, moi

Sir Samuel,"Un gros Big up à tous ceux qu’ont les Red eyes !

Fais attention aux hommes en bleu quand t’as les Red eyez
Traverser la ville c’est audacieux quand t’as les Red eyez

Pense un peu à ta family quand tu te ballades les poches pleines
Et si t’as des gamins non faut pas qu’ils subissent, ne leur polues pas l’oxygène
Bonne vibe !
Si après un sound system et tout c’qui l’accompagne tu te lèves quand même
Bonne vibe ! 
Si t’as de la naturelle mais dis toi bien qu’les chiens la trouvent quand même
J’en connais trop qui sont paranos, 
S’embrouillent pour un regard, pour un mot,
Ils sont restés perchés là-haut
Avec leur Red eyez, Red eyes

Refrain : 
Fais attention aux hommes en bleu quand t’as les Red eyez
Traverser la ville c’est audacieux quand t’as les Red eyez
Ne te fais pas péter pour si peu, t’auras les Red eyez
S’élever c’est mieux quand on est deux, demande à Red eyez

J’ai vu des frères excédés soumis à la panique
En panne de papier, en manque de gomme arabique
J’les ai vus traverser l’équivalent de l’Afrique
Red eyez, pour leur Red eyez

J’ai vu des sœurs excitées prenant l’odeur de la chronic
Puis ensuite regretter, quand arrive le bad trip
Moi perso j’ai flippé, quand c’est d’venu mécanique
Red eyez, Red eyez

Ne te la joues pas trop perso
J’en avais les Red eyez au berceau
Ton cerveau et toi même plus synchro
Ça fait des ravages, Red eyez…

Sir Sly,"I've been smoking on the peace pipe
I've been wondering just what would peace be like
I've been staring into headlights
Swallow me whole, finding my peace of mind
I'm just trying to seize the moment
Trying to love the little things, even if they're hard to love
A monument to love unspoken
Carved into stone, unwilling to come undone

It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I'm up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

I remember back in Oakland
I was lying there in rapture on the bathroom floor
Moving hotel to hotel
Out on the road, no idea really what's in store
Light it up just like a flashlight
Let it shine, let it rise just like a foreign sun
Turn it over and it's capsized
It's finally done, the battle's lost yet I feel I've won

It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I'm up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

It feels good for the first time in a long time now
It feels good to be me

I'm high, staring at the ceiling
Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling
What comes next, I see a light
I'm along for the ride as I'm taking flight

I'm high, staring at the ceiling
Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling
What comes next, I see a light
I'm along for the ride as I'm taking flight

It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I'm up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

It feels good for the first time in a long time to be me
It feels good for the first time in a while I'm free

Sending my love, what a wonderful feeling
What comes next, I see a light

Sir Walter Raleigh,"Splish splash, I was takin' a bath 'long about a Saturday night
A rub dub, just relaxing in the tub, thinkin' everything was all right
Well, I stepped out the tub, put my feet on the floor
I wrapped the towel around me and I opened the door
And then a splish splash, I jumped back in the bath
Well, how was I to know there was a party going on?
 
Bing bang, I saw the whole gang dancin' on my livin' room rug (yeah)
Flip flop, they were doin' the bop, all the teens had the dancin' bug
There was Lollipop with Peggy Sue
Good golly, Miss Molly was a even there too
A well a splish splash, I forgot about the bath
I went and put my dancing shoes on

I swear I won't give in

There's nothing more I can say
I see those big bright eyes
And then I realize
That girl is gonna get her way

When my little girl is smiling
I can't stay mad at her for long
Why should I want to fight
When I can  hold her tight
I just don't care who's right or wrong

It's the greatest thrill there can be
She gets her way it's true

Its not manic if you mean it
Baby on a head rush bottle full of manufactured feelings
Lost to the reelings of my deals and how I wheel them
Sign with a major Si, your soul is a major price
Maybe you can steer the cart if you’re lucky
Take a chance roll the dice, need the money
All my old fans rant that I sold out
Fridge is broken living in the hood
Ask to who? Maybe they can fund me moving out
So when my luck is down
Its anyone’s guess if ill keep on keeping on or quit while I’m ahead
I'm in the lead, these girls ain't even in my league
They're good but I'm out of my mind
They're in stripper clothes & weaves tryna pass the time
If I was doing this to get paid would've married rich
I rap cause it’s how cause it's how I survive plus Si loves the kids

Everything feels fucked up but looks great on paper
These boys want me taken
Write their names across me but the cross on my back
Baggage on my arm makes me rather costly
I'm a risk, full time job I don’t deny the accusations
Just tryna dodge the mob when I feel that I’ve been wronged
I’m the first to gather arms
Go on a hunt burn the purps with these songs
Yeah I'm petty sometimes pretty
Few who get me, some get with me
Oh so witty but most are blind
Been working hard forever on my grind
Got a lot to say but even less time to do it
Lot gather stones to throw but never do shit on their own to lose at
Nice glass house be careful what you say
Your words bark, but mine have been known to carry blades (Carry blades)

Collecting the stars, the glint of the stars

The strongest poison in the land
Riding on the back of my horse with his golden band
Who catches the stars in his eye

His great and empty eye
That had never smiled, never noticed me
I would like to think of that he dreamt of me
When he went to sleep at night

That he thought I was the special thing in his life
But to those great eyes, they see nothing
They don't profess poetry
Don't profess insight into me

Now I stand on empty man
Beside the stable door on the stud farm
And the green and gray attendant
Hands me straw, says, ""Go feed the horses""

Who wears gold bands around his feet
And dreams of stars, and dreams of stars

Dancing through nights...
where the darkness strikes me from inside
Dancing through life...
where its strife enshrines all my desires
Dancing through death...
a dance with the devil and a flirt with the dead

Even where you're not here
I can feel your pain within myself
It's still keeping me down here
Life keeps on growing colder year by year
With a winter heart and my frozen tears
I stand lone to face my darkest fears

I've been wasting away, I' ve been fading inside
I've been drifting away from the lights in my life
I've been living in vain, living insane
I've been tripping down all the darkest of lanes

There's a shadow that dwells inside your head
Within mine as well
Turns our lives into a living hell
Like a curse and a spell
I've been drifting away from days of light
I've been swept away far into the night

Your voice is clearer now than before

A light still wanes in you
Like winter days long gone
In midst of June

On a warm midsummer night
Why do we then still feel so cold inside

Sing for me all sirens of the seven seas
Take me away, lead me astray in your deceitful ways

Hear a thousand voices calling me
Down by the deceitful sea they sing for me

Their eyes are all fixed on me

On a stormy day from beneath the waves
I watched you slip away
And I knew it was far too late

Darkness falls inside of me
And the sorrow's growing day by day
And though my life's a broken memory
There's a door and there's a key

Sorrow comes with silent tears
And the dawn still haunts my darkest fears
What have we both become throughout these years
There's a serpent in our tears

There is a river in my dreams that runs so wide, that runs so deep
And by its riverine I still can hear you weep
There is a winter in my heart so freezing cold and utter dark
It keeps me down and tears my sanity apart

Darkness falls inside of me
And the sorrow's growing day by day
And though my life's a broken memory
There's a door and there's a key

Pretty faces from the covers of a magazine
From their covers to my covers want to lay with me
Fame and fortune still can't find, 
Just a grown man running out of time

[Chorus]
And even though it seems I have everything 
I don't want to be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars 
All of the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything 
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete

Listen
Your perfume, your sexy lingerie 
Girl I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was
It's been a year-winter, summer, spring and fall 
But being without you
Just ain't livin' nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

[Chorus]

I just can't help loving you
But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything and everything 
To hear you say that you'll stay.

Uhh, Sisqo, Associates, T.R.
You feel this, what the deal?

Oh, oh, you knew I was a nigga from the jump
So don't front

Since when, we've been messin

Flexin, numbers been good, no doubt
But now tryna get me on lock down
Tryna figure out what I'm all about
If I'm worn out, no chillin wit, what I'm dealin wit

Just can't, just can't handle it
You're not my girl and I'm not your man
I'm a tell you again so you understand
I'm not tryna be callin, I'm not movin, not buggin

Not tryna get stuck in somethin I can't get of
If you thought twice shorty then I doubt ya
You two get off-a my back
You not too tight, need to cut my some slack
So let's go

[Chorus: LovHer + Sisqo]
Can I live, can I breathe
I can't exhail, get off-a me

Can I live, can I breathe
I can't exhail, get off-a me
Give me privacyyy!

Met her at the club, it was pumpin
Drunk as hell, got the Henne', but thugin
Smokin somethin, I saw you with your girlfriend
Actin like your cousins, but you really wasn't

Plus I caught you wit the horny face
GRRR! And you loved it
Took it to the crib for some fuckin
Touchin, huggin, lotta rubbin

You always layin, not bustin
I hollered at you cause your body was right
And I stay smashin lip cause the shit was tight
What was your time, come with me tonight

If you thought it was sweet, ain't not tonight
I won't go that how and it ain't my life
I'ma baller, you a chicken, need to get it right
So get my wisdom, why you stressin me?

Need to stop stressin me
You can't handle it, chills in the memory!

Ain't tryna go home to the smell of old rabbits
That's why we doin chill so I steal it from your cabbage

The meanin of expense and to clarify your status
You and Magina, and I ain't your partner
So chill wit that crazy bullshit that you sparkin
Crazy enough to bull-clock, you bent off a Ken Robert

Replys on your signature, smotherin my inbox
Call all the time, but never seen
I could smell when you call boo you get the in button
I never understood you ain't in the wood somethin

So why you keep binoculars in hand like the cuffin
You grey-hairin me, no better yet
Fuck that boo you're scarin me, talk you want to marry me

That I'm not in love with you
And then
It came to me

One night in a dream
You mean more to me than I wanted to see
There is nothing I can do
To stop it
Even though you're with somebody else

If I didn't really care, why were you there?
The color of you eyes, the scent of your hair
I know dreams aren't reality
But you're so real
So real to me

It took a dream to tell me that I love you lady
I couldn't see that you were always there for me
Remembering the time we shared together
Came clear to me one night
In love

Tossed and turned and broke a sweat
Of with tears my pillow's wet
I'm drowning
In a river of my homelessness
And only you can save me now
I've got to find someway, somehow
To let you know 
How I feel inside
'Cause it's so obvious and hard to hide

If I didn't really care, why were you there?
The color of you eyes, the scent of your hair
Now I know dreams ain't reality
But it's so real
So real to me

It took a dream to tell you that I love you lady
I couldn't see that you were always there for me

It came clear to me one night

And it came clear to me one night
I am in love
And what can I do
And what can I say
To let you know that I feel the same
Please don't walk away
'Cause I know I can't be wrong

And my dreams they can't be wrong

It took a dream 
To tell me that I love you baby
'Cause I could not see that you were always there for me

She's fine as hell,
I can barely handle it

Got me all out of breath
So fine, on my mind every night
Trippin' off a dream,
But damn she was tight

Oh, I'm startin' to feel funny
Like I'm creepin' on my honey
It's a dream but it feels so real
Feel her body cover me
Waiting for the freak
When I'm with my lady
It's a shame,
I don't even know her name
But I know her measurements 36-24-36
Why am I seein' her eyes,
Them thighs
Could it be that love just hit me? 
In the form of a hot girl fantasy
I hate to say it but the
Lady drive me crazy
That girl, got me
Actin' shady to my baby
I can't shake the spell,
Can't break it 
Goin' crazy thinkin'
Of her butt naked
What to do every night I crave?

Ayo my mental is keep the rock cut keep the glock up
Keep the rock pucks in the basement with the lock shut
Used to sliding under street lights with the peace pipe
Keep the heat tight by my side so I can eat right
All I knew is hit the block and how to crack deals
Make it hot with this rap shit and stack bills
All I'm used to is struggling juggling bugging
With thoughts in my head knowing crack kills
Out for papes gotta let the desert eagle blow
I get cake, this rap shit is legal though
Check the resume, slit that spit that
I put my name in the game Mr. Book
I'ma shine till a nigga can't shine no more
I'ma smoke so much weed I can't find no more
I'ma keep my chest bluish
Keep hitting 'em hard like Ray Lewis
Till they can't feel they spine no more

Oh, slow it down walk away and then you swear you heard this shit before
Niggas say they from the ghetto legend has that they from Baltimore
Get the niggas off the corners now and we goin' hold it down
Associated now we made it what can stop us now

Ayo we bash in brains
Then hit a nigga pockets for the last of his change
Then put a slash through his veins
Bullies of the block we harass in the game
With a sound that so hot it turn gas into flames
Keep jumping around like my raps entertain
Fuck around get beat down with some bats and some chains
When y'all was on them lots dropping cash on the range
I was tongue kissing blocks stashing them things
And now my nigga on only half of the chains
See the corners in the past but my ass is still deranged
I rumble in your ear like that flash when it rains
When I hits ya get the picture
Knock the glass out the frame
Rap for the name dope crack and cocaine
And I'ma drill it in your ear so you can lapse from the pain
And after the fame I'm going back to the wane
But for now nigga, feel the wrath from my game

[Chorus:]

The whole swell hold it down for my hometown
Show the world how we live how we feel we get down
That's my mission show up in my diction
Rep Baltimore every show till there's tension
Hate the fact that we iron we just go hard
High confidence got us feeling that we should bogard
Take over like bush did the poll sheets
A lot of rappers falling off 'cause the flow weak
That's what we here for to bring competition
Battle anybody we them four lynchmen
A yo I bet we won't lose what track you want to use
Let's do it acappella freestyle for your shoes

Can't miss the butch make it hot Cooley High

Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show
The you I've come to know

If a face could launch a thousand ships
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you
You're all that left me too

And when my love for life is running dry
You come and pour yourself on me

If a girl could be to places
At one time, I'd be with you
Tomorrow and today
Beside you all the way

If the world show stop revolving
Spinning slowly down to die
I'd spend the end with you
And when the worlds was through

Then one by one the stars would all go out
Then you and I would simply fly away

Whispered in the dark

Now to the bend of the bow

Let it fly, let somebody try to love you

Too uncool to mention

Now like a song from your heart

How many tears must you cry?
How many seasons must go by

And you kiss my lips and tickle my chin

While life goes on around him everywhere

Sissel,"Wait before you go, so you will know
What I am feeling as you leave
I understand your need for some time
Some solitude

Wait a while before you go
You should know by now
My heart belongs to you

I know that you must leave
And I can see that it's not easy for you
Now that I'll be here, I know that my soul
Is always near you

Wait a while before you go
You should know by now I love you
And so I will wait a while for you

The sand of time
Is slipping through my fingers
You and I
Still the memories linger on and on

Now I know if I can only let go
And wait a while, you'll be here again with me
The same old friends we've always been

Wait a while before you go
You should know by now I love you
And so I will wait a while

Sissel,"When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary
When troubles come and my heart burdened be
Then I am still and wait here in the silence
Until you come and sit awhile with me

You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be

There is no life, no life without its hunger
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly
But when you come and I am filled with wonder
Sometimes I think I glimpse eternity

You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be

You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be
You raise me up to more than I can be

Patrolling the beach 
Riggers say they hard as bricks 
But they soft as a peach 
Climbin the G of all G's 
Please 
I come blowin through like the breeze 
Sitting on the threes 
Post it coast it and mash it down 
Pacific coast in the bomb chrome rims 
Black on black Yukon 
With nuts hangin from the city 
Where the bangers be bangin 
It don't seem like shit is changin 
I hollered at a homey the other day 
G'd up at the park 
Sippin Alisay 
One of the homies took a beatin 
So now we'll start to be a gang 
Checkin at the meetin 
Life cycles repeatin 
It's just another sunset fall and see 
I can hear the homies that pass 
Calling me 
And you know what I discover 
What they keep sayin 
Keep your mind and your money 
Motherfuckers 
And shake busters

But yet you niggas persist to talk shit 
Get off my dick 
Ya never catch me slippin 
Rollin with the heat 
Slap the clippin

Would start trippin 
My life's a though 
Hit the crypto 
Blow the whistle 
They think I bang 
So I pack a pistol 
Warren to the G. is a G. 
I don't fuck with you nigga 
So don't fuck with me 
Let's ride to the East Side 
Slide like a fo 
I pack a 44 
When I'm steppin out dough 
To the bang to the boogie 
If I speak then I spoke

Till ya low 
Get the party lit

Stomp land to land 
And to the Egyptian sands

And all these police tryin to lock me up

Sissel,"Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace
Dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room  

Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined
Playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room  

I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon

Like a well that has no end

Cause a friend in love is a friend in need 
There's a soul out there that yours wants to find
Set your spirit free and I said
Oh yeah I know what you mean

Cause a friend in love is a friend in need
She said hey man come on lets go 
Let me tell you about something that you don't know.
Well I paced the floor and listened to her say 
Love keeps getting in the way. 
How many times will I fall in love with a boy who was my friend 
You see love is a pole that blocks the door with a key
The boy can't lend and I said.

And I tried to find some reason why I know our love is better 
But I've been sinkin', I've been sinkin'.
Well I tried to find a corner in my mind leave it all behind 
But I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'.
We can put it all together babe, we've got plenty of time 
I remember sittin' 'neath the stars, talkin' 'bout love in a broken down car. 
He said what are we gonna do we've lost our way 
And love keeps gettin' in the way. 
Well I replied to the question on his face 
Said love's not a time or convenient place. 
You got rocks in you're shoes you gotta fly if its love 
There is no question why he said.

It's hard to say, What it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always, Be with you
But words can't say, And I can't do
Enough to prove, It's all for you

I thought I'd seen it all, 'cause it's been a long long time
But then we'll trip and fall, wondering if I'm blind

There's been times, I'm so confused
All my roads, They lead to you
I just can't turn, And walk away

But when I turn it's falling from the sky.
It slips away - yeah slips away    So far away.

Make you change your direction    If you check their worth

You know he tries the same, he cries the same
And then you know he dies the same

Sister Hazel,"Well we shared a season    
Running through the fields
We never had a reason

Playing our own games    
We never had no worries
Never thought things    
Would ever change

But I'm missin' you today
Don't know why you went away 

Times I sat and wondered    
Nights we sat and cried
I'm proud to be your brother    
No one knows how hard we tried
To make it to tomorrow    
For just another day
There's never time to borrow    
For things I'll never get to say

So many days I'm searchin'
So many nights I'm left alone
Sometimes the song of the wind
Well it's, only the warning for the storm 

Moments turn to hours    
Months they turn to years
It's different now without you    
With your image crystal clear
The child was the teacher    
A brother and a friend
A fragile little creature    
Who'd do it all again and again

Sister Hazel,"By simple definition I'd be scattered, Oh where do I begin
Well I'm stuck within the mortal framework
Of having to use words
And I, I've never been one 
I've never been one for incompleteness 

My attempts to say - never find their way nah uh
(All these things they escape me)
inconsistency is inconsistency within this conversation yeah!

Sometimes: You know there's no limits and 
Sometimes: I'm a mother, I'm a brother, I'm a lover and another 
Sometimes: I'm scared but sometimes I'm a hero 
Sometimes: But mostly I'm just me! 

In some regards I'd use the term eclectic
The merging of experience
And different points of view - oh yeah
Well I think, I learn, I listen and
I sift my way right through
And I, I'm always the one
I'm always the one with fascination  yeah

What I am    That's for me to be and ...
Where I go    That's for me to know and ...

Knew exactly the plans we'd made and what we were here for 
Didn't have a care in the world  got by day by day 
Struggled with the plans we'd made who was I anyway 

Workin' on both night and day  in a famous rock and roll cafe 
Never thought I'd meet a girl for me 
Never thought I'd meet a girl called Cerilene 

Cerilene  the road of life is dark without you and I, I just can't see 
Cerilene, share my life with me 
We'll go together hand in hand and we'll fulfill our dreams 

Walked along the beach there hand in hand, it felt like a dream 
But things that felt so good were never real or so it seemed 
The magic that this girl possessed 
Changed the heart of a child to a man (to a man) 
Through the warmth of love his dreams and drive had direction again 

A girl who strongly believes in me, and visions that we both could see 
As one of my dreams, it came to an end 
My life and love felt whole again 

[Chorus]
I've grown to love this family, my friends 
And this woman that I've found 
Just as much as the family I left in a small, small Southern town 
On a day the island breezes brought my loved ones here with me 
We made our families one, I love you, oh I love you Cerilene

There's been times, I'm so confused
All my roads, They lead to you
I just can't turn and walk away

It's hard to say what it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always be with you
But words can't say, And I can't do
Enough to prove,
It's all for you

I thought I'd seen it all
'Cause it's been a long, long time
But then we'll trip and fall
Wondering if I'm blind

There's been times, I'm so confused
All my roads, They lead to you
I just can't turn and walk away

It's hard to say what it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always be with you
But words can't say, And I can't do
Enough to prove,
It's all for you

Rain comes pouring down
Falling from blue skies
Words without a sound
Coming from your eyes

Finally I figured out
But it took a long, long time
But now there's a turnabout
Maybe cause I'm trying

There's been times, I'm so confused
All my roads, They lead to you
I just can't turn and walk away

It's hard to say what it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always be with you
But words can't say, And I can't do
Enough to prove,
It's all for you

It's hard to say what it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always be with you
But words can't say, And I can't do
Enough to prove,
It's all for you

It's hard to say
It's hard to say
It's all for you",All for You
Sister Hazel,"I had to walk away
Down the road just to clear my head
On another fun filled day
Of doin' fine, but you're back instead

Now I'm no the only one
Who saw you for just what you were
You pushed me, and I'd keep tryin'
I'd leave you, but you'd start cryin'
But you won't fool me
I'm smarter than that, yeah

You were the one
Who taught me what I don't need
And I thank you
I thank you for that
You were the one
Who brought me to my senses
And I thank you
Now just leave me alone

Far away 'til you could not find me

Sister Hazel,"Well I'll follow you wherever
When you lead me by my nose
On another big adventure I suppose
Then you lay me down in clover
With their petals on my back
I should make some time
To do more things like that

Won't you sing to me your poetry,
Won't you take me to your home,
Won't you be for me forever
So I'll never be alone
And just one thing
If you're my queen
Then it's a beautiful thing

Well I'm buried in my bedroom
Under fourteen feet of clothes
I could drown in all this clutter I suppose 

But then you're standing in my doorway 
With a suitcase on your back
And it blows my mind
When you do things like that 

Won't you sing to me your poetry,
Won't you take me to your home,
Won't you be for me forever
So I'll never be alone
And just one thing
If you're my queen
Then it's a beautiful thing

Yeah, reminding me
Well I might be poor 
But summers free
For me, I didn't know I was sleeping 

Won't you sing to me your poetry,
Won't you take me to your home,

Sister Hazel,"I wasn't looking for a lifetime with you
And I never thought it would hurt just to hear
""I do"" and ""I do""
And I do a number on myself 
And all that I thought to be
And you'll be the one 
That just left me undone 
By my own, hesitation 

And for the million hours that we were
Well I'll smile and remember it all
Then I'll turn and go
While your story's completed mine is a long way from done.

Well I'm on a champagne high
Where will I be when I stop wondering why
On a champagne high
I'd toast to the future but that'd be a lie
On a champagne high, high 

Spring turned to summer 
But then winter turned to mean
The distance seemed right 
At the time it was best - to leave
And to leave behind 
What I once thought was fine And so real - to me
And while I'm still gone 
On the quest for my song
I'm at your - celebration 

And for the million hours that we were
Well I'll smile and remember it all
Then I'll turn and go
While your story's completed mine is a long way from done.

Your wagons been hitched to a star
Well now he'll be your thing that's new
Yeah what little I have you can borrow
'Cause I'm old and I'm blue

And for the million hours that we were
Well I'll smile and remember it all
Then I'll turn and go
While your story's completed mine is a long way from done.

Where will I be when I stop wondering why 
On a champagne high (so high)

Sister Hazel,"Hey, hey
Did you ever think
There might be another way
To just feel better,
Just feel better about today

Oh no
If you never want to have
To turn and go away
You might feel better,
Might feel better if you stay

Yeah yeah
I bet you haven't heard
A word I've said
Yeah yeah
If you've had enough
Of all your tryin'
Just give up
The state of mind you're in

If you want to be somebody else,
If you're tired of fighting battles with yourself
If you want to be somebody else

Hey hey
Have you ever danced in the rain
Or thanked the sun
Just for shining, just for shining
Or the sea?
Oh no, take it all in
The world's a show
And yeah, you look much better,
Look much better when you glow

Yeah yeah
I bet you haven't heard
A word I've said

Sister Hazel,"I'll go away
I'll go on my wordless way
Don't say anything
Say nothing, just leave me. 

I've been merely, an actor
In your painful play.
But I feel too much to stay.
Just cast me out. 

[Chorus]
You can have the pictures 
You can have the jacked up car.
And take the book on meditation
I'll just take home what I brought, 
My, big painted velvet Elvis... 

Well take it away
Take it all away
Don't leave anything
Leave nothing, except me 

'Cause I've been sadly misinformed
I thought it mattered a little more than this
I wish I was a thousand miles away... 

[Chorus] 

Well I'm frozen here
Caged in silence
It's better that I 
Regret these words 
Than to stand aside 
And watch your tragic
Storyline unfold...
Just let me go 

[Chorus]

Well you took my heart 
And you took my soul
And you used me,
I've had plenty of that.
It gets harder and harder
And farther and farther
From what I need for me.",Elvis
Sister Hazel,"It's bitter
Tastes a lot like winter
And will it- release me 

So heavy
How much more to bring down the levy
And kill me - don't kill me

I've been stayin' high...
And I've been feelin' sorry 
For myself
And I've been resurrecting my
Fortress to protect myself 

Shattered 
Tired, beaten, worn down and tattered
Can you-even hear hear me?
What do you expect out of me
I'm being buried alive and screaming 
Can't you see - Can't you see me ? 

[Chorus] 

Weary
My hands slapped I'm cautious and leary
Of tryin' - oh but I'm tryin' 

How am I to figure it out
All alone I've been kickin' around
Without my home - I'm so lost...

Sister Hazel,"It's wrong, not right so bad you know it.
I've been wrung in and out.
You say, you want, you need, it your way.
You kick and scream and shout. 

You twist my words
To ease your mind 
Don't stand there smiling, at me 
Don't think it's me
When it's always you, it's always you 

Give in, give out, give up, it's over.
Why even bother if I'm always wrong.
Give in, give out, give up, it's over.
So much for trying it's time to move on. 

You try, to back, me in, a corner.
So sick of playin' your game.
Too much, too hard, to take, You're giving.
So much that I don't need. 

You twist my words
To ease your mind 
Don't stand there smiling, at me 
Don't think it's me
When it's always you, it's always you

Why even bother if I'm always wrong.
Give in, give out, give up, it's over.
So much for trying it's time to move on.

Your mind, my heart, our words, they drain me.
I've heard the same old lines
I'm tired, worn out, so weak, don't push me.
Don't try it one more time. 

Give in, give out, give up, it's over.
Why even bother if I'm always wrong.
Give in, give out, give up, it's over.
So much for trying it's time to move on.

Sister Hazel,"[Chorus]
If she's out there somewhere-somewhere 
I would give everything to know.
Just to hold and to finally have her,
Take me to sunrise from indigo 

If it's to be
That there's just no one for me
I'll try not to cry much
So no one will see
But if it's to be
That there is anyone for me
Our hearts will shine
So everyone will see
I've got some time,
So maybe if you're free
I could use a friend
Just to talk to me 

[Chorus]

Spent most of my life without
Anyone near
Never cared what happened
I never saw clear
But I'm getting older now
And I'm, thinking of my end
And to leave without love
Or without a friend 
I've got some time
So maybe if you are free
I could use a friend 
Before I die

It's not over yet
I'm still standing

Turn me upside down
I know it sounds a little bit lazy
But I lost myself in a mystery
Save me some aggravation
And tell me your wisest tale
Take me away

Won't you save me
Please hurry please
Won't you tell me what's worthy now
Won't you save me
I thought for myself 
Can't you forgive me for that 

Turn round, where ya goin'
Slow down my hopes on you
I've paid my dues a thousand times over
'Cause I was not born ready made
Teach me, teach me everything
And leave no turn unstoned

Now we've been on this walk before 
And I can't take it lightly anymore
Well again I said 
It's just there's so much wasted time
Quit wasting time. 

Hold on, wait a minute
Take note this one's on me

For a cynic or a statue of a hypocrite

I'm emptied out like a dusty shelf
You buried me, and I'm covered in shame
I'm here but you look right through me 

Just hear me out for what it's worth
You still rip my breath away
I've come around
I know you've heard it before
And again and again

[Chorus]
Shame on me shame on me
It's bittersweet but I'm so sorry
It took so long but you believed
(I'm sorry it took so long)
Shame on me, shame on me
Because you're every questions answer
Shame on me 

So clever, but I tripped somehow
I never guessed you could knock me down
I am just a bit undone
Displaced and burned like fire 

Just hear me out for what it's worth
You still rip my breath away
I've come around
I know you've heard it before
And again and again

[Chorus]

I didn't get it I never wanted to
My self destructive attitude said
What did you want 
And why would you want it at all?
But you never went away 

You faded out but it took so long
It's tainted 
How could I let this slip away from me
For a wondering Jones
I'm here but you look right through me

[Chorus]",Shame on Me
Sister Hazel,"Sometimes I wake with a weary head and
I wonder how I'll ever get through
Then I think of the things you said
How you told me to my self be true
My faith in things unseen,
My belief that it'll all work out
May seem like a strange cup of tea,
But if its all right with you than it all 
Right with me 

Oh my feet I walk, with my legs I run
In my arms I'll hold another day
With my head I think, from my heart I sing
And with my hand to my face I pray 

There's times I feel with the stains of life 
I could just turn around, turn around walk away 
Then a strength like a beam from above 
Lifts me up by the hand and it leads me to say
Good things for good people you see
Good things they seem to all work out
May seem like a strange cup of tea but
If its all right with you well then its all right with me 

Oh my feet I walk, with my legs I run
In my arms I'll hold another day
With my head I think, from my heart I sing
And with my hand to my face I pray 

Getting by ain't enough for me
I know what I like I like what I see
I'm not only flesh and blood but 
I'm heart and soul I know 

Sometimes I feel at the end of the day
Was it worth while or have I settled for less
I sit back and your there by my side sincerely you say, 
We're both so blessed
Count your blessing count them one, two, three 
Don't give up cause it'll all work out 
It may seem like a strange cup of tea but
If it's all right with you, it's just fine with me 

Oh my feet I walk, with my legs I run
In my arms I'll hoild another day
With my head I think, from my heart I sing
And with my hand to my face I pray",Strange Cup of Tea
Sister Hazel,"With my head above the water 
I can breathe to stay alive
But I'll try a little harder 
If you want me to survive 

Won't somebody tell me?
How I got to this stage?
When consequence is inconsequential
And
Staring in the spotlight
Is better than real life 

It's been surreal, how do you feel
When the seas part before your eyes
It's just so real how does it feel
When the stars that follow die 

With my head above the water
I could drift along, beyond the tides
But I can try a little harder
If you help me to reach the other side. 

It's been surreal, how do you feel
When the colors have left you blind
It's just so real how does it feel
To have left yourself behind",Surreal

That brought me to my senses

I miss being overwhelmed by you
And I need rescue

Of the days we laid by the school and said forever

I miss talking all night long with you
And I need this to find a way to your home

Can't keep my hands from shaking
Stumbling through the wreckage again
But you're gone

And I run myself in the same old circles
And I sit and I stare
And I run old scenes through my tired head

So listen 'cause you are 
The only one who cares to hear

Lend me your time and
We'll go somewhere
And kill some wine
Show me your soul and I'll shine my light
Where it seems so cold now
Give me your lips and I'll tell you about
All the things I miss the most
Open your mind and
I'll crawl right up and sleep inside of it

When was the last time you felt high
Oh you were the best I've ever felt
Cause I don't need you to fix me
I just want you to listen

It's killing me too
It's so wrong not to be with you
It's getting harder to stay awake
It's killing me too
It stops my heart just to be with you
So listen 'cause you are 
The only one who cares to hear

When was the last time you felt high
Oh you were the best I've ever felt

Sister Hazel,"We knew it all from a little thing
It was everything in our first minute
And it took us to another place
Yeah another place and we fell in it
How dare you not remember
How dare you walk away
We adored every little thing
Every little thing would leave us breathless
Every dawn spelled another day
And in another day we weren't so restless
How dare you not remember
How dare you walk away

[Chorus]
And I wanted you so much
Just like I do right now
I wanted us to be the one 
The poets write their books about
I wanted it to last
I wanted to grow old
But life got in the way

We walked around in a heavy haze
We were stuck in days of so much warring
We got lost in a tricky maze
Yeah a tricky maze that was so scarring
How come you can't remember
How dare you walk away
Then you start to add the little things
Add the little things and trip the mighty
Now we got a little bitter thing
A little bitter thing that grew like ivy
And how dare you not remember
How dare you walk away

[Chorus]

And apathy grows quietly where rapture used to fly
And promises and certainty have left love here to die
Won't you stay and don't let this one fall away

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah well life got in the way",Life Got in the Way

One heart, one soul
One life for us to give
One dream, one mind

Hangin' out in heaven inspired by our light

In the middle of the eye of a hurricane
Would you now but somehow
If we were tethered here together
We could weather out the weather here

But that's not the same as insane
And I'm scared, 
But that's not the same as being afraid

If I find myself in over my head
If I shatter from the fall and I lose
I'd still want to swan dive, into you

Well I can take the truth, 
No I can't, yes I can
Tell me we were meant

Would you get it if I told you

She'll embrace your innocence maybe

Better than I know myself

How can I leave?

Was elegant and wild
Her lips were salty sweet
Hidden in a flawless smile
How can I leave?
How can I leave?

And here is where I die to tell her
It's out of my hands

The truth is, it doesn't have to end
Meet me in the middle 
And we'll do it all again
The truth is that life begins to bend
Around itself and turns before it comes around again

Stole my first kiss 
Underneath her summer sun
How can I leave?
How can I leave?

The first thing I see 
Every time I close my eyes
Sea and land meet
Amarillo sun is rising
How can I leave?
How can I leave?

This is where she cries
I didn't stand a chance 
And this is where I die to tell her
It's out of our hands

The truth is it doesn't have to end
Meet me in the middle 
And we'll do it all again
The truth is that life begins to bend 
Around itself and turns before it 
Comes around again

I've done what I came here for 
And maybe more than that
But Devil you know is safer than
The chance that you take with something new

The truth is it doesn't have to end
Meet me in the middle and 
We'll do it all again.
The truth is that life begins to bend 
Around itself before it comes around again

Do you think about me
Or even dream about me
I bet I do more about you

Cause you don't know my name
So you can't feel my pain

I don't wanna be the boy next door either
I just wanna be more than a zero
Cause I need something more
Cause I deserve much more

Have you ever seen me
Or felt the air between me
And you as you pass me by bye
Will you ever turn and
See that I've been learnin'
Anything that will help me talk to you

Cause I don't need to be your superhero
I don't wanna be the boy next door either

I might be the only self destructive superhero
Cause I can fly
But I don't know quite how to land
Without a crash
Without a crash

Will you ever touch me
Or stop and laugh to crush me
You've seen me before
Did you notice me
From the window railin'
It's easier than failin'

Now I'm not going to take it

Can I piece together a scene of what we were

This was just a start of a long goodbye

I thought I saw the light inside your eyes
Oh, how will I know
If you can even hear yourself inside

Better than pretending that this is a life

By losing faith
Bein' guided by fears
And I'm hangin' on every word

Help me away, and its all I know

It's killin' me to see you slippin' away, yeah

No, you can't even speak to me
No, you can't even walk with me
Until I save myself
Oh, I have to save myself

Now the systems we have placed
To protect ourselves
Are hard to erase
And the egos that we bring
Are the guarding walls that have brought us this far
And its all I know, That addictions don't like
To let you go

No, you can't even walk with me

Are familiar ghosts that won't go away
And the patterns that we break
Are the only hope that can shatter their grip

I am angry, I am scared
How much more 'til I disappear
Woe, somethin's got to go

Wastin' time
Stuck in years of frustration
I've never been patient at all

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Sister Sin,"Deliver me your darkest hour 
And let me tell you this; laughter don’t deform this face no more 
Nothing left here worth to savor
You know it´d come to this, the time to leave you with

Scars from the past dear mother
Hope it hurts you to know I came out stronger

No headstone or cross, no prayers no god 
A shallow grave is all there be to your memory 
Make no mistake; I´ll be better off this way 
You never brought this bastard down
My will be done 

Say again but don’t come closer 
Silence when you speak to me! 
Seasons pass and I´ve grown colder
Tables turn and cards play out, ain’t it ironic how

How life came about dear mother 
In the end it´s just you, it´s you who´ll suffer 

No headstone or cross, no prayers no god 
A shallow grave is all there be to your memory 
Make no mistake; I´ll be better off this way 
You never brought this bastard down
My will be done

No pity or shame, forgiveness nor blame 
Just history fading away
Spare me the lies, all the tears and your trials 
Stones lay as thrown just like you would know 

No headstone or cross, no prayers no god 
A shallow grave is all there be to your memory
Make no mistake; I´ll be better off this way 
You never brought this bastard down
No pity and scars in my body and heart 
No monument or sympathy to your memory 
Make no mistake; I’m well off and on my way 
You never brought this bastard down

I was walking down the street one day
When I looked up I saw a friend

Hey Frankie, do you remember me?

He looked at me and then I blushed
'Cause I remembered I loved you so much
Way back then we were friends
Going together but then you left me

Frankie, do you remember me?
Frankie, do you remember?

You were fifteen, I was twelve
It was summer, we were so in love.
I never loved anyone this much
Look at me, I'm thrilled to your touch.

Hey Frankie, do you remember me?
Frankie, do you remember?

Oh how you brought me down (down, down)
All I did was run around (around)
You'll never know how much I loved you

Frankie, do you remember?

You walked me to the Deli then
We sat in the booth where it all began
I looked into your big eyes and
Said to myself we coulda had twins

Oh how you brought me down (down, down)
All I did was run around (around)
You'll never know how much I loved you

Sister Sledge,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)

(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)

Until the ocean severs every mountain high)

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As

Ain't nobody who'll wait on you,
When you're acting like
You're nearing the end.
Even though it's tough.
Been through so much.
What you know you take from it and shape it
Until it makes you strong.
When you find that strength,
Really can't complain.
The same stuff that brought you down
Is the same that makes you turn all around;
Over the heads, of the ones you dread,
And nothing comes between you and your higher place.

I don't feel anymore what I felt before.
Don't you understand me?

Walk away from what gets you down.

Robbing yourself of life that could be.

To realize that nothing matters,
Ever, unless I let it.

Sister Souljah,"(Intro):
(Man says): We're gonna slow it down at this time
And sing a soulful number.
This song is a song that, why' know, we all want to sing sometime
why' know what I mean?  This is the love crowd right?
We all love each other, don't we?
Ai-ight?  ""All right!""
Let me hear you say yea!!!!
""Yeah!!!!!""

(Verse 1)
I needed love from somewhere. Somebody to interpret.
My mother was supposed to, but she's far from perfect.
My body was young.  Feeling n' thoughts were so sexual.
No one to explain, so my body had no schedule.
And when it was right, or if the time was wrong.
My nursery rhyme turned to a passionate song.
So we tossed n' turned. Burning in heated sweat.
No one ever explained.  There's nothing to forget.
An explosion of rain like there is in a storm:
Body wet.  Heart beating.  Body burning and warm.
No mama never said to say no, not even how to
Tell one from another, or what to expect to
Go for or demand, except or reject,
Or when to say yes.  And also to protect.
So I had no choice.  I imitated what I saw.
My mother had one man, plus three, equals four:
One for his car, one for his job, and one for spite.
And one did her right as I listened in the night.

(Chorus)
(In background a lady sings): ""Souljah, Souljah, Souljah, Souljah!""

(Man say's): The children cannot raise themselves!
The television, the baby sitter, the radio cannot raise your children! 
Anything you want the children to know, you must teach them!  
You must teach them!
If you do not teach the children, they will not know. 
They will not know!

(Verse 2)
Now she yelled and hollered, and sometimes even screamed.
And never explained quite what she would mean.
Mad at the world for the way she never understood.
And if she couldn't explain, what makes you think I could.
So there's life in my belly-or say, ""A biscuit in the oven""-
Kicking and hitting, and pushing and shovin'.
And my biggest fear is that it'll ask me those questions.
All I'm qualified to give are mistakes and confessions.

(Interlude)
""I never thought that this would cause so many problems. 
I wish I had somebody to talk to.
God, I'm so confused?""

Now a cycle repeats over and over again.
Make it topsy turvy: the lives of women and men.
Bringing life into the world should be considered a blessin',
But it isn't 
when you haven't been taught the lessons
Of motherhood?
Now, adoptions not an option. Not even abortion.
Won't make the baby pay for societies distortion.
Got to go for self, despite societies abuses.
Schools built to destroy minds.  Upset and confused.
Met a friend the other day.  She said her name was Souljah.
She said, ""I'm here to tell ya what your mama never told ya.""
""Raise your child"" she said.  ""Raise your head like a warrior.
If you don't, the world will destroy ya.
We need your baby: mind body and soul
To reestablish the laws of the old,
Wise, life-giving ways of our people.""

(Chorus)
(In background a lady sings): ""Souljah, Souljah, Souljah, Souljah!""

(Man say's): The children cannot raise themselves!
The television, the baby sitter, the radio cannot raise your children! 
Anything you want your children to know, you must teach them!  
You must teach them!
If you do not teach the children, they will not know. 
They will not know!

(Verse 3)
She said, ""Girl, you're original.  And that's definite.
You're first.  Your wisdom is infinite.
Ex-plore your mind.  You have so much to give.
If you seek knowledge, you'll have reason to live!
In a war, 
there can be no excuses.
Two camps: 
the used and the users.
Your mind:
You've got to read and nourish.
Your talent
Then unfolds and flourish.
We can't blame your mom.  We know she did what she could.
But girl, you've got to be twice as good!

(Chorus)
(In background a lady sings): ""Souljah, Souljah, Souljah, Souljah!""
(Man say's): The children cannot raise themselves!
The television, the baby sitter, the radio cannot raise your children! 
Anything you want the children to know, you must teach them!  
You must teach them!
If you do not teach, they will not know. 
They will not know!",Umbilical Cord to the Future

And now you're stuck just like a snail in it's shell

All that matters is that you can be free to live your

Instead I set the thing on fire
I had to say this out loud anyway

I'm so glad I found the nerve
To say what you deserve

Insult you like a fool
Never take your call when you're nobody at all
Until you're somebody
And then they want to be your friend
How comes jerks don't know they're jerks

So next time someone makes you feel little
Just sing this song inside you head
And like a great big cartoon bubble
These lovely words will dance above their head

Impossible vain
You told me I was totally without shame
I thought to myself
This kind of luck is my middle name
Boy you need to know
Sometimes I think I'm out of my head
The bigger the words
The stranger I feel
So give me a chance to explain
And erase all bad things
I've said

You tell me I'm selfish,delirious
That's not what I am
I tell you I'm speechless,Do do do do
You know who I am
I've got a little sparkle,Do do do do
Inside of me
And you tell me I'm selfish,delirious

In between days
I wanna paint a rainbow
To cover all the gray
In between days
I wanna kiss and tell to end
This game we play
I wish you could read my mind

You tell me I'm selfish,delirious
That's not what I am
I tell you I'm speechless,Do do do do
You know who I am
I've got a little sparkle,Do do do do
Inside of me
And you tell me I'm selfish,delirious

Tell me do you cry
I cry all the time
Tears that are turning to ice
I cry
Sparkle come alive
Sparkle that melt I

I wish you could read my mind

You tell me I'm selfish,delirious
That's not what I am
I tell you I'm speechless,Do do do do

All of the art of playin' by heart
See I'm burnin'
Just out of school of breakin' the rules
Yeah I've been hurtin'
Findin' the key,the code to what's me
Now I'm certain
I feel what life's about
Still I'm just finding out

Strong winds are turning deep inside
And I feel it,and I know it
Strong winds are blowin' all around
And I ride,and I ride,and I ride
Strong winds are learnin' me to fly
And to make it
Strong winds are movin' me around

Never look down but always think twice
That's what ma mama told me
Changes will come when the future is bright
Yeah you'll see it comin'
Like the fool on the hill in need of the thrill
Pushin' you slowly
Nobody else but you and yourself
Have to worry

You'll find a time and a place
Just when you stop the chase

Voices inside will let you know
When it's time to just let go
Don't be afraid of what you feel
Just be ashore of that it's real

Strong winds are turning deep inside
And I feel it,and I know it
Strong winds are blowin' all around
And I ride,and I ride,and I ride
Strong winds are learnin' me to fly
And to make it
Strong winds are movin' me around

",Aku Cinta Padamu
Siti Nurhaliza,"Lupakan aku saja 
Dari kaca fikiran
Andainya bersamaku
Engkau tidak bahagia
Aku bukannya insan
Ingin cinta percuma
Sehingga aku 
sanggup menantimu
Walau berabad lama
Cintaku bukan 
kerana harta
Cintaku tidak
 kerna paras rupa
Sedarilah kasih
Cintaku harap 
hingga ke syurga
Bersama-samamu
Demi kasih sayang
Yang aku pertahankan
Sanggup ku meniti 
Malam tanpa mimpi
Aku berdoa
Kita dapat berdua
Hingga ke akhir hayat
Untuk selama-lamanya
Cintaku bukan 
kerana harta
Cintaku tidak
Kerna paras rupa
Sedarilah kasih
Cintaku harap 
hingga ke syurga
Bersama-samamu
Demi kasih sayang
Yang aku pertahankan
Sanggup ku meniti 
Malam tanpa mimpi
Aku berdoa
Kita dapat berdua
Hingga ke akhir hayat
Untuk selama-lamanya
Aku bukannya insan
Ingin cinta percuma
Tetapi aku 
sanggup menantimu
Walau berabad lama",Demi Kasih Sayang
Siti Nurhaliza,"Bermaknakah tipa baris kata-kata
Ataukah hanya di bibir saja
Bersungguhkan rindu yang engkau pamirkan
Ataukan sekadar lakonan
Rindu
Telah melekat dalam hatiku
Walau awan lalu
Rinduku tak berubah arah

Purnama mengambang cuma berteman
Bintang berkelipan dan juga awan
Siapa tahu rindu yang mencengkam
Di hatiku
Aku meminta pada yang ada
Aku merindu pada yang kasih
Aku merayu padamu yang sudi
Merinduku

(Purnama mengambang berbagai warna)
(Bila embunpun datang tinggal purnama)
Tinggallah aku
(Sendirian)
Bertemankan malam sepi
(Aku meminta pada yang ada)
Aku merindu pada yang kasih
(Aku merayu)
Padamu yang sudi memujuk
Aku meminta
(Pada yang ada)
Aku merindu
(Pada yang kasih)
Aku merayu
(Padamu yang sudi)
Merinduku
Hiaskanlah cinta di jaris manisku
Sinarkan bagai gemerlap kencana
Tandakanlah kasih di mercu kalbu
Serikanlah purnama yang merindu",Purnama Merindu
Siti Nurhaliza,"Dulu, Kau Pernah Berjanji Pada Diriku
Untuk Menjaga Dan Menyayangiku
Itu Bererti Sampai Akhirnya
Kau Meninggalkanku

Kini, Kau Ingin Kembali Pada Hatiku
Setelah Kau Pergi Meninggalkanku
Haruskah Hati 
Memberi Kesempatan Dirimu

Haruskah Aku Percaya
Segala Yang Kau Ucapkan
Kata Kata Maafmu, Kata Kata Memohon
Untuk Kembali Kepadaku

Meski Cintaku Padamu
Lebih Dari Yang Kau Tahu
Namun Mengerti Kasih
Tak Semudahnya Itu
Melupakan Yang Telah Kau Lakukan Padaku

Beri Aku Waktu
Untuk Memikirkan Yang Terbaik
Cinta Jadi Dilema
Pergi Ataupun Kembali

Haruskah Aku Percaya
Segala Yang Kau Ucapkan
Kata Kata Maafmu, Kata Kata Memohon
Untuk Kembali Kepadaku",Bila Harus Memilih
Siti Nurhaliza,"Daku Terasa Ingin Membawa
Cinta Yang Terlara Ke Titik Mula
Kembali Mencuba Untuk Kali Kedua
Menggilapkan Gerhana Jiwa

Pernah Ku Terasa Ingin Merayu
Pada Kasih Dulu Pulang Padaku
Lupakan Dosaku Putihkan Kelabu
Tenangkan Amarahmu
Namun

Bisakah Yang Terpadam Dinyala
Bisakah Yang Terhina Dicinta
Walau Ku Himpunkan Sesalku
Bisakah Terbuka Kalbu

Naluri Meminta Kuungkap Kata
Seindah Bahasa Janjikan Setia
Akan Bersemilah Cinta Dihatinya
Percaya Ku Semula
Namun

Bisakah Yang Benci Disayangi
Bisakah Yang Dusta Dimaafi
Walauku Himpunkan Sesalku
Bisakah Terbuka Kalbu

Bila Senduku Berlinang Sayu
Dalam Rindu Ku Tertanya

Bisakah Yang Benci Disayangi
Bisakah Hatiku Difahami
Walauku Himpunkan Sesalku
Bisakah Terbuka Kalbu",Bisakah
