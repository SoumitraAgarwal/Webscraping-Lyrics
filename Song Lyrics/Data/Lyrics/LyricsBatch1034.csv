Avatar,"I entered the house
On the hill one day
Trying my best just to get away
No one was home
But the voices were clear
They let me know
I was welcome here

Life is so wonderful
Life is so beautiful
Stay a wile
No one gets out alive
Life is so wonderful
Life is so beautiful
Just smile
No one gets out alive

I walked down the halls
Of that haunted place
A whisper was leading me
Through the maze
Promising warmth
Knowing my name
Knowing my reasons
And why I came

A face in a painting
Looked down on me
Smiled at me loving and tenderly
Reached out her hand
Stroking my hair
Suddenly voices were everywhere",Black Waltz
Avatar,"Förbannade jävla idiot!
Har du någon aning
Om vad du ställt till med?
Tusen som faller
Ett kort steg för dig
Men en stor jävla smäll
För hela mänskligheten

Sitter I skiten och undrar
Det är något fel
På dem som beundrar
Du sitter på toppen
Du lever din dröm
Du sänker din yxa
Över den redan dömd

Fan!

Allt är förlorat
Spring för livet
Måste härifrån innan gatorna
Dränks I blod, blod, blod!

Äckliga jävla parasit
Kan du inte se vad fan som
Händer?
Städerna brinner
Vi drunknar I lik
Ett tragiskt farväl
Till hela mänskligheten

Springer för livet och hoppas
Om vår tid ska komma
Så måste du stoppas
Det smärtas att födas
Lindrar att dö
Men vi som ville leva
Står redan I kö så",Blod
Avatar,"Keep me in mind
For all of your trials
Keep me forever
Just give me a day in denial

Grant me a wish
Just a mistake
Grant me a fire to love
Make me feel
Before it's too late

Burn
Let me burn
Let me cleanse my soul
Cleanse my soul in napalm

Drown me in sand
For all coming eons
Drown me in sorrow
Just take me back home
Where I came from

Give me a chance
Let me explain
Give me the cure
To the sickness I am
I can't take the strain
Give me a name
Something to save
Give me a meaning
To live with my stains
It can't be too late

Take your stations
I am ready too roll

Avatar,"You feel a sudden pain
The night turns bright as day
This shit is going straight out of your mind
You start to feel afraid
It is the price you pay
To get the thrill you need to stay alive

Let it burn

Between the cuts and cries
You'll find a way to die
Just take a sip and twist it like a knife
A city full of sound
Too late to turn around
You need to flee the light to save your life

You like when it hurts?
Let it burn
Let it burn

You ain't sure what came first
Was it your flame or thirst?
You need to please them both to put you out
Another wasted youth
You thought you'd seen the truth
We need to find a voice to help you shout

I like when it hurts
Let it burn

Goes as far as he can
For country and king 
Nothing will stop him
Oh, what a man
The master of war
He's coming for more
He's raping your children

Handsome and brave
He will dig out our grave
And all the living things
Dies as he's watching
Handsome and brave
His weapon is rape
We cannot escape
He's taking your children

What will they take
When everything's lost?
What will they take
Oh, everything's lost!

If you don't want us to live
Let us die
There's too much pain to take in

We've lost our homes

Is born and nurtured
To each a hell of his own
A new order

Why are you turning so cold?
No one, nowhere
There's nothing out there
To each some pain of his own
Can't remember
How did I get here?
Why am I turning so colt?

One touch
It's so cold and silent
Why can't I stop from falling?

An apocalypse of our own
It's all empty

Break off your chains, and look what I've found in the dirt
Pale battered body, seems like she was struggling
Something is wrong with this world

I'm willing to give it away
All that I love

Remember the lives
Lost within withering pages, trying to hide
But I see tragedy through a lifetime

Visiting a little boy
Stayed up watching late-night shows

Once upon a time below
Stangers' faces pale and old
Misery and broken bones

Are you sacred of what you might like?
Are you scared you'll get out alive?
Hear the wind blow and church bells chime
Hear the mob that awaits outside

Shame on you who dared survive
You shall pay

Tiny children, small no more
Voice their anger
""Burn the whore!""

Will this path take you down below?

Speak the truth that they want to hear

I'll keep you safe with all my power
I will build you a tower

In every stone I'll carve your name

In our own little tower

Ashes paint our bedroom gray
These shall be our finest days
As I pledge, my precious flower
Keep you safe in a tower

Stay inside and dream of towers
Wake up all alone

All alone you count the hours
Right where you belong

Don't be scared, you won't be hurt
I promise that I'll keep my word
Just behave and we can play
Just do everything I say

Do not speak and do not think
I will give you everything
Everything within my power
I will bring to your tower

the chill of cold wind, the breath of the dead.

Trapped for eternity.
Black crows break the silence.

The garden of the dead s alive tonight and you can't stop it.
Just enjoy it.
Open up your mind and you will feel it too.
The sound, the touch, the thoughts, that you've been so blind to.
You can feel the thoughts of the dead.
Feeling the thoughts of the dead.

True or false, it's still there, teaching me.
True or false, still there, teaching me.
You can feel it tonight.

Stone all carved by hand.
Statues that resemble their faces.

A voice commands from high above this earth
From the soil his blood cries out to me
Murder, liar, vengeance, deceit",Chapter Four
Avenged Sevenfold,"Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight

Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and loved

It's building up inside of me
A place so dark, so cold, I had to set me free
Don't mourn for me,
You're not the one to place the blame
As bottles call my name I won't see you tonight

Sorrow sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me or cry while I'm away

Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
But I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight

So far away, I'm gone
Please don't follow me tonight
And while I'm gone everything will be alright

No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight
No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight

Avenged Sevenfold,"Come back to me, this is inconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide suicide

I just want to die, take away my life
Lay by your side, please

Come back to me, this is inconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide

Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend
He's gone nothing will take back time
I need him back, but nothing will take back time

I can see just fine with you in my life,
There by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow

Nightmare, full of pain
Nightmare, full of pain

I look back and see the twisted road
Best friends and despair took its toll

Take away
Take away
Take away
Take away

Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me, I cared for
And most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me
Or cry while I'm away

Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend
He's gone nothing will take back time
I need him back, but nothing will take back time

Avenged Sevenfold,"""I'll try,"" she said as he walked away
""Try not to lose you""
Two vibrant hearts could change
Nothing tears the being more than deception
Unmasked fear
""I'll be here waiting"" tested and secure

Nothing hurts my world,
Just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall

I wish I could be the one
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me
When time soaked with blood turns its back
I know it's hard to fall
Confided in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me

Nothing will last in this life
Our time is spent constructing
Now you're perfecting a world, meant to sin
Constrict your hands around me
Squeeze till I cannot breathe
This air tastes dead inside me
Contribute to our plague
Break all your promises
Tear down this steadfast wall
Restraints are useless here

Avenged Sevenfold,"This shining city built of gold, a far cry from innocence
There's more than meets the eye round here look to the waters of the deep
A city of evil
There sat a seven-headed beast, ten horns raised from his heads
Symbolic woman sits on his throne, but hatred strips her and leaves her naked
The Beast and the Harlot

She's a dwelling place for demons, she's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicate with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great

The city dressed in jewels and gold, fine linen, Myrrh and pearls
Her plagues will come all at once as her mourners watch her burn
Destroyed in an hour
Merchants and captains of the world, sailors, navigators too
Will weep and mourn this loss with her sins piled to the sky
The Beast and the Harlot

She's a dwelling place for demons, she's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicate with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great

The day has come for all us sinners
If you'r enot a servant you'll be struck to the ground
Flee the burning, greedy city looking back on her to see there's nothin' around
I don't believe in fairy tales
And no one wants to go to Hell
You made the wrong decision
And it's easy to see
Now if you want to serve above or be a king below with us
You're welcome to the city where your future is set forever

She's a dwelling place for demons, she's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird

Avenged Sevenfold,"Passion in my eyes, I lived it everyday, but how could you go throw it all away?
In my dreams it's me and you, it's there I saw it all come true
As time went by faith in you grew, so one thing's left for me to do (finish you)

I feel it burn inside, burn like the rising sun
Lifted into the sky, took away the only thing I loved
I know after tonight all your power crumbles in my arms
So don't worry, I'll be fine, when my life ends, I'll leave this scar

A smoking gun in your hand, now don't you realize what you've done
Put a bullet in his back, your hero since you were so young
How could you kill the man who brought salvation through your pain
He must mean everything to end it all this shameful way

I started here so young and helped you get along
Just did it for the love, and people healed through us
Don't live your life in vain, don't take it out on me
You're cracked, so just remember, I'm not your enemy
I don't deserve to fall this way, by a man who felt betrayed

I felt so down now you're around to rescue me
Every note and every word i'm listening
Sometimes problems seem too deep to take
Sometimes I cry thinking my future looks so bleak
Finally, together we were destined, I know what's best for us in the end
Someone hear me, someone stop me, someone listen, why aren't you listening?",Betrayed

Don't give them all the power when your future's in desperate trouble baby

Running away from condition, I see you but you're running away from
Your scared seductive system

Most would claim I live a lie when pointing out it's easy to predict these things
Every color has its side, they live together vote but most won't read between these lines
Please help us, please save us of course they have control we're all the same
Up on the cross, crucified their problem drove the nail and let Him rot
Family and friends, it won't matter in the end I'm sure they'll understand
Now look at the world and see how the humans bleed
As I sit up here and wonder 'bout how you sold you mind, body and soul
Looking at the fields so green I know this sounds obscene
I see you're living for tomorrow but decisions you have made will leave you empty

so unsure but it seems, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway

I see a distant light, but girl this can't be right
Such a surreal place to see so how did this come to be
Arrived too early

And when I think of all the places I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life and realize this is going too far

I don't belong here, we gotta move on dear escape from this afterlife

'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on, far away from here

Can leave this place but refrain, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway

This peace on earth's not right (with my back against the wall)
No pain or sign of time (I'm much too young to fall)
So out of place don't wanna stay, I feel wrong and that's my sign
I've made up my mind

Give me your hand but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand I have to leave and carry on my own life

I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on, far away from here
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light, and I'd hope you might
take me back inside when the time is right

Loved ones back home all crying 'cause they're already missing me
I pray by the grace of God that there's somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be
(I am unbroken; I'm choking on this ecstasy)
Oh Lord I'll try so hard but you gotta let go of me
(Unbreak me, unchain me, I need another chance to live)

I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear escape from this afterlife

Take me back inside when the time is right

Loved ones back home all crying 'cause they're already missing me
I pray by the grace of God that there's somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be
(I am unbroken; I'm choking on this ecstasy)
Oh Lord I'll try so hard but you gotta let go of me

Constantly reminding us that our actions are the cause of all their problems.
Pointing their fingers in every direction.
Blaming their own nation for who wins elections.
They never contributed a fucking thing to the country they love to criticize.

Ignore the untrue

Try and get through
Admitting mistakes can hurt

Avenged Sevenfold,"I've been traveling for so long
So lost till I stumbled upon
Two roads in front of me
I had to take my time

To the right I could see a church
I took a step in that direction first
But to the left there was a watering hole
Where they were whiskey drunk
And now that's where I wanna be
The fight down here goes on and on

If I was perfect
Then this would be easy
Either road's plausible
On both I could drown
I walk through the center
With no rules to guide me
I realize it's difficult
But now I can see

There's gotta be another way to go
A way that's much more feasible
A combination of both these lives
A central path without choosing a side

I make decisions one at a time
And though I never say I'm always right
I'm confident that when I stand on my own
You'll see the truest form of a man
When I'm shining through
The fight down here goes on and on

If I was perfect
Then this would be easy
Either road's plausible
On both I could drown
I walk through the center
With no rules to guide me
I realize it's difficult
But now I can see

Oh, I hear them now
All the religious rhymes
(Anger I see)
(Anger I see)
(Anger I see now)

The left isn't better
It's just more of the same
Condemning all these people
For what they believe

I'll climb to the top of the mountain again
No one is going to see me this way
And the closer to the top I get
The more they take aim
But I'm not you

I may not be perfect
But I've always been true
I may not be worthy in your eyes
Climbed up from the bottom
For the last time
The last one the last one
The last time

Either road's plausible
On both I could drown

Avenged Sevenfold,"The problem with society's been how do we teach
And if they'll believe.
We'll fight this battle for years to come
Till we only accept that we can stand on our own.

Grandfather used his hands, he worked them to the bone.
To provide his family with a happy home, alone.

Don't take your aggression out on me.
My own man is all I'm meant to be.
This god-damned place is so lazy old and tired
All your ideas are so, uninspired.
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

Don't wanna be, they never say
But don't call us the liars.

We've walked these alleys a thousand times
And scattered around a thousand lies.
They are trying to hold you till you'll lie,
It maybe hard, but keep your feet on the ground.
Why don't I have the finer, things that others have?
The chance is there if you want it all that bad.
So bad.

Don't take your aggression out on me.

Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

Don't try and get me confused.
Cause I do understand.
And sometimes people need help.
That they may need a hand
When this problems going on.
A thing you have to get straight
Is that you don't own my hand.
And I don't owe you a thing.
So don't think about how sorry
You feel when now your treated so bad.

This God-damn place is so lazy old and tired
All your ideas are so, uninspired.
Takes more than one idea,
More than one person to fight the fight.
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

And as a race we look back and we've come so far.
While some may conquer,
The others had it so hard.
But instead we just complain
While there's no one for us to fight.

Avenged Sevenfold,"As a young boy chasing dragons with your wooden sword so mighty,
You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast.
Times change very quickly,
And you had to grow up early,
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet.

[Chorus]
You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade,
In a corner, forgotten away
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, and his honor.

The smell of resigned leather
The steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call.
He taught you all he ever knew
To fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the
Screams of evil men.

I need some piece of mind, it's got me tired

Just as I arrive, I'm slaving to the grind
Making the money so I feed my family

A gentle breeze that feels alright
Home alone
And I can't feel the pain
Only strain
Enjoy the sights
I feel alive
When actually here just feels alright

""We have one collective hope: the Earth And yet, 
uncounted people remain hopeless, famine and calamity abound 
Sufferers hurl themselves into the arms of war; 
people kill and get killed in the name of someone else’s concept of God
Do we admit that our thoughts & behaviors spring from a belief 
that the world revolves around us? Each fabricated conflict, 
self-murdering bomb, vanished airplane, every fictionalized dictator, 
biased or partisan, and wayward son,

When I track the orbits of asteroids, comets, and planets,

I see a universe ever-expanding, 
with its galaxies embedded within the ever-stretching 
four-dimensional fabric of space and time 
However big our world is, our hearts, our minds, 
our outsize atlases, the universe is even bigger 
There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on the world’s beaches, 
more stars in the universe than seconds of time that have passed since Earth formed, 
more stars than words & sounds ever uttered by all humans who have ever lived
The day we cease the exploration of the cosmos 
is the day we threaten the continuing of our species 
In that bleak world, arms-bearing, 
resource-hungry people & nations would be prone to act on their low-contracted prejudices, 
and would have seen the last gasp of human enlightenment 
Until the rise of a visionary new culture that once again embraces the cosmic perspective; 
a perspective in which we are one, fitting neither above nor below, but within""",Exist

To make you come home
Seems so long ago you walked away
And left me alone
Y yo me acuerdo what you said to me
You were acting so strange
Quizas fui ciego y no quise entender
That you needed a change

Was it something I said
To make you turn away
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here
Right now

I've been seating here
Can't get you off my mind
I try my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane wishing I can touch your face
But the truth re-mains
You're gone
Tu no estas, gone
No-o, gone
Oh baby girl, baby girl you're, gone
No-o, gone

I don't want to make excuses baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone no no
Pero si algo es verdad mi amor
Siempre me rindo a tus pies
El tiempo pasa tan lento baby
Esa es mi vida sin ti (esa es mi vida sin ti)
And maybe I can change my everyday
Pero no puedo mi amor
So I'll just hang around and find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you

Am I still in your heart

Te necesito aqui

La dama perfecta, toda una belleza, ella es mi inspiración
Somos feliz ella y yo (ella y yo)

Solos nos vemos a escondidas para ahogar esta prohibida pasión
Y aunque tiene dueño, yo solo tengo un sueño, ser su protector

Quizás su marido no mande en su corazón
No sabes quien es victima en la confusión

Oye mi pana lucha por amor
No, no me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás ese tipo no mande en su corazón

Por eso te entiendo y aunque sea casada 
no te alejes por temor, no lo hagas Don, ay no no no

Pero la carne nos llamaba, y la cama nos hacia una invitación
A solo hacer el amor

Cuando hay personas que se aman, el amor tiene que vencer
Y ya el marido entiende que perdió su hembra ahora es tu mujer
No pueden ganar los tres

Me traicionaron las ganas de volverla ver
Y aunque todavía no puedo creer
Lo que este amargo encuentro me hizo comprender
Pues tú también llegaste a ese lugar
Donde tantas veces yo la fui a buscar
Y aunque no es fácil lo que voy a hacer
Admitiré que salí con tu mujer

Salí con tu mujer (¿qué?)
Salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer

Que te perdone Dios, yo no lo voy a hacer
Los perdí a los dos y a la misma vez
Ya veo que todo era mentira cuando ella me decía
Que se iba pa' Puerto Rico a vacaciones con su amiga
Me mintió, tu y ella en una cama, allá en Bayamo
Quizás en Isla Verde o Carolina, cuantos hoteles ensucio,
Tú también, los odio a los dos (no me entiende)

Se que no es fácil dejar lo que haces has un intento antes que
Fracases yo también vivo para ti
De que te quejas corazón si lo que quieras te lo doy
Los lujos a mi no me importan solo tu
Entonces solo ámame yo se cuidarme créeme
Si caes preso hay mismo olvídate de mi

Mi amor entiende bien mi padre cuidara de mi no quiere que me pase nada
Entiendo que el te quiere pero mas te quiero yo no pierdo esta batalla
Vuelvo y te digo deja lo que haces has un intento antes que fracases

We were more than sweethearts,

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,

Old black magic that you weave so well

Same old tingle that I feel inside

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Avery Watts,"Here's what it looks like (Looks like) 
Being the best
What it looks like, to be a cut above the rest

Nobody understands what it takes to be the man
Having every single person say you can't when you can
To give up everything you've ever known for a dream
And never stop the fight no matter how hard it seems
You sacrifice, you bleed, you sweat, and you cry
Doing everything you can not to lay down and die
When you fall and you call out, there's no one to help
So you've got no other option but to pick up yourself
At the end of the battle you're the only one standing
Everyone watching, the stage you're commanding
The pages of history will speak of today
And when they talk about the champion
This is what they'll say

Here's what it looks like (Looks like) 
Being the best
What it looks like, to be a cut above the rest

People will break you right down to nothing if you let 'em
They'll say, ""There's a million others like you, what makes you better?""
But remember that these folks are afraid of the unknown
They're the ones who wet the bed if they go 10 miles from home
Stay Down: Is what they scream in your ear
The only weapon that they have to use is fear
So you take all the beatings and you take all the hits,
But your back on your feet for more, you don't quit
You'll never back down, never stop, never pause
Never give up, never sacrifice the cause
This is your life, you gonna let somebody take it?
Look in the mirror That's all you need to make it
Here's what it looks like (Looks like) 
Being the best
What it looks like, to be a cut above the rest

The smoke has all cleared, and you own the throne
You're king of the castle, and everybody knows
They bow in your presence, and fear your might
Cause they know for damn sure what it, what it

Here's what it looks like (Looks like) 
Being the best
What it looks like, to be a cut above the rest",A  Cut Above

This is the real deal not a test
Now society is calling out an SOS
Get down on the ground, put the earth to your ear
You feel that sound? That’s revolution you hear

Welcome to the greatest battle of all time
We’ve just officially been targeted by our own kind
The time has arrived now were sounding the alarm
Man up, grab your loved ones, get everybody armed

Exactly what you’re really made of inside
When comes right down to it what you gonna choose
To proudly hold your ground or just lie down and lose?

The enemy approaching outside the door
Dust off your voice box, time to be heard
And as the gate drops

Tragedies and death; they say it’s all a phase
Society lying to me
It’s on the front page

If you saggin’ and you flaggin’ its cold; you keep heat
I understand your plan; be strong not weak
My gut feelin’ is this killin’ goin’ make us obsolete

Let’s defy not rely on negativity
We gotta makeover, takeover these communities
Analyze, capitalize, opportunities

Cause I just started an army picking up a pen

This begins a global collaboration
To take the whole world and make but one nation
This ain’t no imitation what you hearing is elite
That's why everything stops when you hear us speak

Oh! Back to the mission at hand, we’ve got a plan
Take the message that were sending and spread it across the land

Now let every single syllable settle into your head

As it slowly resonates from your mind to your feet

No time to stick around I gotta be a ghost

The root of every problem in their family lives
But secretly they fear what they're seeing in the mirror 
It's so clear

They're marking my arrival by the calendar date
They wanna have fun so we rock and then I run

Avery Watts,"Go into the mind of the everyday grind, of the blind in the darkness
What do we find? It’s a kind of confinement combined with pain,
Aligned by mankind and set to drain

Stuck in a 9 to 5 to stay alive, living in a dive to barely survive
The whole time you try to get ahead,
Just to get a little peace before you get dead
Nuff said.

Since your very birth, since your first breath on earth
It seems that life has been preordained
The order that it goes in? I'll explain:
Welcome to the world, go to school, get a job,
Get married, have a kid, be a dad, be a mom
Move along

Don't think, don't stop, don't dream
Everything in the world is exactly how it seems

Were told how to look, how to act, how to feel
What’s good, what’s bad, what’s fake, what’s real
And when times get tough and it’s hard to deal
Just pick your poison and the pain will heal

Got the blues? There's plenty of booze to choose,
Drugs to use, money to lose
You don't need to educate yourself on the truth,
That's already done
On the evening news

Born to lead, but we act like cattle
Not anymore, get ready for the battle
Sick of it all? Then get one fist up and
Scream at the top of your lungs, hey

That's enough
Throw those hands in the air
Get ‘em up
Show we've had it up to here

Put your seat-belt on, prepare for a collision,
cause those who see with the eyes of the blind,
They lack vision

Work, eat, sleep, wake, repeat
8 by 5 by countless weeks
Coffee, copies, floppies, faxes
Troubles, traffic, caskets, taxes

Fact is media sees, we find lifes answers in magazines
But why even read?
Everything that you need to believe is on a box we call the TV

Don't think another thought
Stop, erase, forget what you’ve been taught.
You can cheat what you don't know let’s break it on down
Here we go!

Your Brain? BAKE IT
Waist? FAKE IT
Don't have money for it? JUST TAKE IT
Your Hair? DYE IT
Courage? BUY IT
This will make it bigger over night, just try it

Go into the world and make a name
Or just do it online, in a video game
You can stay inside until you scream
And live your life in front of a screen
It’s sickening

What have we become?
You’re better than all that, don’t play dumb
It’s never too late to change all this stuff
Don't be afraid, stand up, say
That's enough
Throw those hands in the air
Get ‘em up
Show we've had it up to here

All this pissin’, dissin’, and bitchin’ got me on a mission
My ambition got you wishin’ you weren’t in the position
To be the personal ignition of my lyrical rage
I’m out the cage, blowing off the ever-lovin’ chain
Insane

To put it plain mein I’m Gone
I’m the bane of all existence from this day on
If you want more - that man I be
I’ll snatch your eyes out cha head before you get a chance to see
Who me?

That’s right son, best believe it
‘cause unlike some when I say it I MEAN IT

I’m droppin’ tricky tongue tracks when I put out the wax
Now let’s bring the hook back so everybody can relax

That's enough
Throw those hands in the air
Get ‘em up
Show we've had it up to here",Enough

Can’t you see were bleeding?

Yeah i’ve taken many beatings and gladly paid all my dues
But I refuse to dummy down and follow the herd
I’m gonna say what I believe and stand by my word
See, i’ve never known the taste of a silver spoon
Never took the blue pill, not to mention i’m immune

Can’t be controlled, won’t do what i’m told
I’m not a number, a name tag, or fit into a mold
As my story unfolds I will proudly stand
Forever unapologetically; I don’t give a damn
This is

Who I am (what I believe)
Who I am (with every breath I breathe)
Who I am (tried and true)
The only thing to be in this world is you

Substance, with every single syllable I bring
‘Cause you can talk all day long and never say a thing
We don’t even need the music for me to convey i’m not playing
I’ll write it out in braille, you can feel what i’m saying
That’s real

No facade, I will never be part
Of propped up pop propaganda, fake art
With no heart, no soul, I cannot be sold
I’ll be the bright light in a dark mine that’s black as coal

Whether i’m mocked, blocked or knocked still i’ll never stop
Like a rock, as consistent as hands on a clock
You can bet i’m gonna be locked, loaded, ready for a test
I don’t walk and talk, I do better than the best.

No vest on my chest, i’m not afraid to die
I’ve been blessed, so I live every minute i’m alive
And I take this vow; while i’m here above ground
Never will I ever back up or bow down

When death comes to get me i’ve got no regrets
I threw it all on the table when I placed my bet
Said it all, did it all, and i’d do it again just so
So the world will know

Who I am (what I believe)
Who I am (with every breath I breathe)
Who I am (tried and true)
The only thing to be in this world is you

Cock back the hammer, the takeover has begun
Were millions strong now all united as one
We compose the whole globe from the east to the west
And if seeing is believing
You’re looking at the best

Patiently wait, anticipating the arrival
Of a crew to lead the whole world through and shine a light
So we can make it through these dark times and spread a new word
For now is the moment
And we will be heard

We
One youth, one nation
We
One generation
We
United like soldiers
We are the takeover

We’ve been through so many years of tears, sacrifice and pain
Gave buckets of sweat, drip-dried our last vein
Watched everything we’ve ever loved forever say goodbye
But instead of killing us,
It brought us to life

We live each day to the fullest now and we choose to make a change
In return our own existence is what we exchange
If we have to give up everything to do something great
We are ready, we are willing,
Cause this is our fate

The very thing that all fear the most
Not a man of flesh and blood (No!)
An apparition
A vision with no form
A mind inside the eye of a cyclone

Indefinably infinite (Right!)
All coalescing together we make scores
A one chord fermata forevermore

Through all the wind and the rain

No matter the hurt or the pain
We don't wane
Whether weak or strong
We soldier on

But when I return to my homeland
I was confused by the changing tide

How can I live with the ghost gal
With the face like I wanna die
And I wasn't sure of my ghost plans
From a distance I heard her cry:

You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh dear boy, it's so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh, dear boy, it's so shallow without you
It's a chance, boy, everything I ask of you

Sweet love of mine, destruction ain't a crime
For those who find love as a game like you and I
Go dance in the waters of all the tears we have cried
Oh boy, we're fine, do you remember our time?

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
Oh dear boy, it's so hollow without you

Hey sister! Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker

Hey sister! Do you still believe in love? I wonder
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you

Avicii,"Hope there's someone who'll take care of me
When I die, will I go?
And hope there's someone who'll set my heart free
Rest alone when I'm tired

There's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed
How will I fall asleep tonight?
How will I rest my head?

And that sin, I don't want to go
To the seals of war through shame
And there's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed
Oohh! Oohh!

Oh I'm scared of that middle place
Between light and nowhere
I don't want to be the one
Left in there, left in there

There's a man on the horizon
Wish that I'd go to bed
And if I fall to his feet tonight
Will allow rest my head

And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed
And there's a ghost on the horizon
When I go to bed...
Ohhh! Ohhh!",Hope There's Someone

Avicii,"Liar, liar!
Why on earth won't tell the truth?
Liar, liar!
Can't nobody see the lie of you?

Follow you to dust
Leaving footprints on the clouds as we're walking home
Iron hearts all turn to rust
By tears and the days on a diamond street

Is this apocalypse?
Chasing shadows, living dreams that don't exist
Anymore...
We need to find a way...

Well, we are who we are, and we're all going under
When the past with the last and will last until under

Liar, liar!
Why on earth won't tell the truth?
Liar, liar!
Can't nobody see the lie of you?

Wall closing in your head
Counting heartbeats 'til the feeling's good and gone
On a dark path there to watch
A sad greed pouring rain over everything

You'll think it's apocalypse
With the whispers of the sand and the sun eclipsed
Forever more
We need to find a way...

Well, we are who we are, and we're all going under
When the past with the last and will last until under

Liar, liar!
Why on earth won't tell the truth?
Liar, liar!
Can't nobody see the lie of you?

They keep talking but I can't hear them, no
I just sit there and watch them come and go
There might be something underneath it all
But at least I'll find, we'll all find out in the end
But at least I'll find, we'll all find out in the end",Liar Liar

Out on the midnight
The wild ones howl
The last of the last boys have thrown in the towel
We used to believe we were stars aligned
You made a wish and I fell out of time

Time flew, cut through
All over town
You make me bleed when I look up

Avicii,"Hey, once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Hey, when face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

One day my father—he told me,
""Son, don't let it slip away""
He took me in his arms, I heard him say,

""When you get older
Your wild life will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid.""

He said, ""One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember.""
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me

When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shinning stars
He said, ""Go venture far beyond the shores.
Don't forsake this life of yours.
I'll guide you home no matter where you are.""

Fire shining cold alone outside
You stripped it right down to the wire
But I see you behind those tired eyes

Now as you wade through shadows that live in your heart
You'll find the light that leads on
'Cause I see you for you and your beautiful stars
So take my hand, don't let go

'Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose it, sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

I've seen the darkness in the light
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that's black and white
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time

We have to tear down walls that live in your heart
To find someone you call home
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

'Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose it, sometimes you're shooting

Search for you, lover, creation
When you're feeling down in this place, just replace them

When the time comes we'll run to the station

Remember when we were running 'cross the nation
We were living for the here and now

You can't catch me
I'll be gone by the time they come
You can't catch me

Even though the children have sold their guns
We must remember the fallen ones
Remember the fallen ones

Raised in the capital of Port-au-Prince
Born with them pillars in them tenements

When we got to the United Station
A teen under pressure, had to blend in
Before the guitar I had a MAC 10

Avicii,"That's me right there on the corner, listening to Wu in my Walkman
Neon lights at the water, reflecting the city of I'm lost in
That's me right there on the corner, I one day would be leaving
For a dream that I didn't have, that I'd one day would believe in
Strange how the same place I ran from's
The same place I think of whenever the chance comes
It's inevitable cause wherever I go

I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I that I've lost my backbone
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm

I'm from a place where we never, openly show our emotions
We drown our sorrows in bottemless bottles and leave them to float in the ocean
I'm from a place where we never, seperate people from people
Some generalize, but in general I still believed that we are treated as equals
My father, my mother, my sister, my brother, my friends and my family's there
My hope and my money, my innocence in a sense, almost lost everything here
Rught where I was founded, is right where I'll be found dead
The streets of my backbone until I get back home

I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I that I've lost my backbone
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm

I'm not alone, I am the fire that burns not of the city, but out of the 'burbs
A river that's just dying of thirst, I am a reverend lying the church
A cracking in the pattern, a miracle waiting to happen
I promise that never was kept, one of those moments you'll never forget
I am that feeling inside the one we all know but can't really describe
I am the blood spill, but I'm in love still

Somewhere in Stockholm, but I'm not alone
Don't have to get by on my own, I'm finally home
Hemma I Stockholm

I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I that I've lost my backbone
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm",Somewhere in Stockholm
Avicii,"Tryna set myself up for the win
So people got a dream that's so much bigger than the diamond ring
So gimme love gimme love gimme please give me piece of mind
I know there's enough to a star than I need a little help with mine
California, don't let me down
Seas of golden
But there's trouble all around
Sunset Jesus, came to me
He once was a waiter now he's a singer
Making money on the street

My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm not alone in the road (but I know)
My dreams are fading 'til I get old
Breathe for a minute breathe for a minute
I'll be okay

Staring at a billboard from the bus
Looking at the faces thinking that could be anyone of us
So gimme hope gimme hope gimme hope on this lonely ride
'Cause I know one day I will be the one in disguise
California, don't let me down
Seas of golden
But there's trouble all around
Sunset Jesus, who came to me
He once was a waiter now he's a singer
Making money on the street

My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm not alone in the road (but I know)
I'm in here fading till I get old
Breathe for a minute

My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down alone the road (but I know)
My dreams keep fading 'til I get old
Breathe for a minute breathe for a minute
I'll be okay

My heart's been broken and I'm down alone the road (but I know)
My dreams keep fading 'til I get old

Avicii,"Alone searching for devotion, and the fading melody
So trying to cross an ocean, and I won't bare to leave
Locked up my, who know what I try to say
My heart all the time was stolen, begging for a treat

Some nights I talk to myself
I said the words that I can´t say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I said the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself
I said the words that I can´t say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I shout the words I never said when you were with me

I'm gone, love has got me open, love is insanity
So long words I left unspoken, I couldn't set them free
Won't sure the love [?] [?] going on the thing
My heart, I left it for broken, [?]

Some nights I talk to myself
I said the words that I can't say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I said the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself
I said the words that I can´t say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I said the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself
I said the words that I can´t say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I shout the words I never said when you were with me

Avicii,"Ten more days under water
And I already know
I'll be fine
Ten more days 'till it's over
'Till the darkness goes
And I see the light

I'm torn between
Fulfilling my wildest dreams
To satisfy the beast inside of me
And I grounded love

That raises me high above
The grabbing hands of cowards
And of thieves
Ten more days to find my way
Ten more days 'till I'm awake
Ten more days 'till I don't have to fight

I don't need a future king
There ain't a prayer that I could sing
Ten more days and I'm gonna make it right
You see my conscience betrayed me
But baby I'm strong enough to take the tides
The bed it trembles beneath me

But wherever the road is rough
You know I'll rise
I'm torn between
Fulfilling my wildest dreams

To satisfy the beast inside of me
And I grounded love
That raises me high above
The grabbing hands of cowards
And of thieves
Ten more days to find my way
Ten more days 'till I'm awake
Ten more days 'till I don't have to fight
I don't need a future king
There ain't a prayer that I could sing
Ten more days and I'm gonna make it right

Avicii,"I've been a beggar and I've been a king
I've been a loner and I've won the reign
Losing myself just to find me again
I'm a million miles smarter, but I ain't learnt a thing

I've kept my word for whatever that's worth
Never been last, but I've never been first
Oh I may not be the best, but I'm far from the worst
Oh I may not be the best, but I'm far from the worst

Oh I've seen trouble more than any man should bare
But I've seen enough joy, I've had more than my share
I'm still not done, I'm only halfway there
I'm a million miles ahead of where I'm from
But I still have another million miles to go

Why I keep on searching for the city of gold
I'm gonna follow this yellow brick road
Thinking it maybe, it might lead me home
I'm a million miles farther and a long way from home
I know that there's a plan that goes way beyond mine
I got to step back just to see the design
The mind fears the heart but the heart doesn't mind
Oh I may not be perfect, but I'm loving this life
Oh I may not be perfect, but I'm loving this life

If I could make you, make you fall in love
Wish I could make you, make you fall in love

Baby love will come around if you want it enough

Love will come around

Wednesday my empty arms were open

I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love

How did I get so blind and so cynical
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable

Does it come down and fall like tears?
And how is the Jordan and its clear waters?
And how are the mountains, the hills?

I spent all my money filling the tank up

The better part of the last ten years
The pictures I've been packing up
All seem to have been taken right here

Take a good look its the last time you'll see me
Bumming a beer
I'd hate to think that I'm gonna get lonely
Living down there

Do any of you lovely ladies feel like drinking
A little closer to the ocean
It's getting late and I'm starting to think just maybe
I'm in no condition

Always beat the boys up

Made my money by cutting grass
Got fired by fried chicken ass
All in a small town, Napanee

You know I always stay up without sleepin'
And think to myself
Where do I belong forever
In whose arms, the time and place?

Can't help if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way
I may switch off and go in a daydream

In this head my thoughts are deep
But sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not pretend? I'm off again in my World

I never spend less than an hour
Washin' my hair in the shower
It always takes 5 hours to make it straight

So I'll braid it in a zillion braids
Though it may take all friggen day
There's nothin' else better to do anyway

Lay under the milky way
On and on it's getting too late out

Take a look at me
And you'll see I'm for real
I feel what only I can feel
And if that don't appeal to you
Let me know
And I'll go
'Cause I flow
Better when my colors show
And that's the way it has to be
Honestly
'Cause creativity could never bloom
In my room
I'd throw it all away before I lie

That you're only telling me what I want to hear
But do you give a damn
Understand
That I can't not be what I am
I'm not the milk and cheerios in your spoon
It's not a simple hearing but not so soon
I might have fallen for that when I was fourteen
And a little more green

She was a girl 
Can I make it any more obvious 
He was a punk 
She did ballet 
What more can I say 
He wanted her 
She'd never tell secretly she wanted him as well 
But all of her friends
Stuck up their nose 
They had a problem with his baggy clothes 

He was a skater boy 
She said see you later boy 
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face 
But her head was up in space 
She needed to come back down to earth 

Five years from now
She sits at home 
Feeding the baby she's all alone 
She turns on TV 
Guess who she sees 
Skater boy rockin' up MTV 
She calls up her friends 
They already know 
And they've all got
Tickets to see his show
She tags along 
Stands in the crowd 
Looks up at the man that she turned down

He was a skater boy 
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her 
Now he's a super star 
Slamming on his guitar 
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

Well tough luck that boy's mine now 
We are more than just good friends 
This is how the story ends 
Too bad that you couldn't see, 
See the man that boy could be
There is more that meets the eye 
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy 
And I'm just a girl 
Can I make it any more obvious 
We are in love 
Haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world

I'm with the skater boy 
I said see you later boy

I'll be at the studio

The world around me, know my pain.
The world that I see. 
So maybe I am bound by fate.

To me the night captures a sudden glimpse.
I am all alone. 
But what is another night all alone, 
When you are spending every night on your own.

I never thought I'd 
Need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie 
Is made up on your side

When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do
Reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do

When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were
Yeah, yeah
And all I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul
I can hardly breathe; I need to feel you here with me

Sneaking in the neighbor's swimming pool
Yeah, he taught me how to break the rules

Hey, those days are long gone
And when I hear this song it takes me back

We were on top of the world
Back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
Acting stupid for fun
All we needed was love
That's the way it's supposed to be
Seventeen

Stealing beers out of the trailer park
Flicking lighters just to fight the dark
My favorite place was sitting in his car
Seventeen
We laid a blanket on the roof top
That time I knew I wouldn't make him stop
The nights were cold but we kept 'em hot

Hey, those days are long gone
And when I hear this song it takes me back

We were going all night
Didn't care about anything
We were living our dream

No more stupid words can leak out
I walk around my house in my bear feet and dead silence
and listen to the stairs squeak
Bumping around, the lights off, in the dark
In may silverware drawer where I'm feeling knives and forks
I get the sharpest utensil I can find
or maybe just a pencil to grind
Lead poisoning in my mouth
But any thing I can find is to cut my tongue out
So I could stop all the stupid things I say
and music will probably change my wicked ways
Smile with my blood stained teeth
Just talk with my hands when it's time to scream
A butter knife, started sawing at my gums
Chewing on some stainless steel
till my mouth gets num
and then, and then...
I take a jab at my tonsils, the center consol
Now I'm spitting out chipped teeth no relief
Will this chill me, to stop those lives I mislead
I let the world watch my mouth bleed
Now I cut my tongue, it's only hanging by a little piece of meat
but I try not to wake my family when there asleep
I get some rusty scissors and now I'm trying to cut this thing out
It's like the bad it's always curios about the good
and there's no doubt that the cured it's always curious about the bad
still trying to cut my tongue out
with every cut I try not to wake my daughter up
I'll end up a babbling idiot with my lips sown up
Haven't found a way to kill me yet
or take this animal away to the vet
they come from far to spit on me
and all this time the good stays curious but the bad stays furious
cut my tongue out. but by this time I'm dizzy and nauseous
Slitting with a knife as obviously cautious
kitchen tile now it's all full of spit and blood
see, but I try not to slip
away I creep back the stairs and go to sleep
I wash the blood of my face and lay my head on my pillow case
I've succeeded

Nunca voy a dejar que te pase nada
Pero sí voy a dejar
Que te pase de todo aquí conmigo
Nunca voy a dejar que te pase nada
Pero sí voy a dejar
Que te pase de todo aquí conmigo
Nunca voy a dejar que te pase nada
Pero sí voy a intentar
Que pases tu vida aquí conmigo.

Axel,"Hay miradas que sin dudas
Dicen más que mil palabras
Y que al verlas todas juntas
Son como espejos del alma
Hay miradas que cuando miran
Son hirientes y lastiman
En cambio hay otras tan serenas
Que consuelan y acarician

Hay miradas insistentes, misteriosas, recurrentes
Y las hay indiferentes, como las de tanta gente
Hay miradas que ocultan verdades
Que mucho danan
Y las hay que en la diaria lucha
Fortalecen y acompanan
Hay miradas que perdidas entre miles de miradas
Andan solas por la vida

En busca de otras miradas
Y hay miradas que cautivan
Por lo bellas y profundas
Como tu mirada azul
Que me atrapa día a día
Hay miradas que por tristes
Enlutan a quien las viste
Y hay esas miradas dulces

Que ennobleces a quien las luce
Hay miradas que derriten
Hasta el corazón más duro
E iluminan suavemente
El pensamiento más oscuro
Hay miradas
Que perdidas entre miles de miradas

Andan solas por la vida
En busca de otras miradas
Y hay miradas que cautivan
Por lo bellas y profundas
Como tu mirada azul
Que me atrapa día a día",Miradas
Axel,"Creo que uno nunca está preparado para oír
Las cosas que no tiene uno muchas ganas
Porque te juro que puse mi cielo
Y todo mi corazón
En esto que nacía en mí para tu alma
Si bien me daba cuenta que
No era igual al mío
El interés que mostrabas

Me alimentaba de mi fe
Para poder creer en tus palabras
Te dejo una parte de mi ser
Mis suenos y toda mi voz
Me llevo este gran amor que sentí yo
Te dejo mi luz y mi color
Llenando en ti cada rincón
Y si elegimos este amor

No fue casual, entiéndelo
El separarme de ti me tomó por sorpresa
Tan de golpe así
Se está desdibujando mi alma
Y no me queda nada
Solo se quedan en mí
Las cosas que vivimos
Tantas cosas, mil
Y este secreto de lo que yo he sentido por ti

No era igual al mío

Axel,"Yo sé que tú piensas
Que soy algo tímido
Y que no coincido
Con lo que te escribo

Que cuando estás
Cerca te miro y te miro
No digo palabras
Parezco un niño

Te hablo de a gotas
Amarte es un rito
Una ceremonia
Que yo solo practico

Te observo entera
Te radiografío
De pies a cabeza
Paisaje divino

Me acercas tu boca
Me arden los labios
Parezco sediento
Desesperado

Más mudo que nunca
Por señas callado
Te digo te amo
Te digo te amo

Es que yo sólo sé porque
Callo y no te hablo
No es difícil de entender
Si lo vieras de mi lado

Vales tanto para mí
Que colecciono tus frases
Y atesoro tus halagos

Sería mi peor pecado
Perder un solo detalle
De ti no poder guardármelo

Por eso mi amor
No soy tímido
Sólo contigo me pasa

Porque si siento no hablo
Por eso no hablo

Si me preguntaras
Por cada momento
Te haría un detalle
Un detalle perfecto

Riendo tus risas
Llorando tu llanto
Y en las despedidas
Muriendo en tus brazos

Me acercas tu boca
Me arden los labios

No sé si dormía,

Celebra la vida.

Ayuda a la gente,
y por lo que quieras
Lucha y sé paciente.

Lleva poca carga
A nada te aferres
Porque en éste mundo,
Nada es para siempre.

Que sea tu guía,
No hieras a nadie
Reparte alegría.

Celebra la vida, celebra la vida,
Que nada se guarda
Que todo te brinda.
Celebra la vida, celebra la vida,
Segundo a segundo y todos los días.

y si alguien te engaña
Al decir ""Te Quiero"",
Pon más leña al fuego
y empieza de nuevo.

No dejes que caigan
Tus sueños al suelo
Que mientras más amas
Más cerca está el cielo.

Grita contra el odio
Contra la mentira,
Que la guerra es muerte,
y la paz es vida.

Celebra la vida, celebra la vida,
Que nada se guarda
Que todo te brinda.
Celebra la vida, celebra la vida,
Segundo a segundo.

No sé si soñaba,
No sé si dormía,

Celebra la vida, celebra la vida
y deja en la tierra tu mejor semilla

Axel,"Ella besa su virgen morena
Todas las mañanas apenas despierta
Ella va caminando la calle
Pero nunca pasa bajo una escalera

Ella mira el fútbol en la tele
Y en la misma silla de siempre se sienta
Ella pone su hojita de ruda
Dentro del zapato y anda muy suelta

Ella tiene mi amor para siempre
Y sabe que nada yo hago sin ella
Pero el 13 no quiere ni verme
Y yo que la extraño no puedo entenderla

Porque ella me mira tan dulce
Que a mi me enamoran todas sus rarezas
Y al mirarme se pone tan mía
Con esas costumbres, con esas creencias

Que yo acabo creyendo que es cierto
Y corro por todo lo que desea
Y aunque siempre ella toque madera
Se que voy a amarla por la vida entera

Ella usa al revés su camisa
Como un amuleto de la suerte buena
Ella apuesta al siete de pleno
Aunque en la ruleta le salga una letra

Ella cruza la calle aterrada
Porque un gato negro la mira de cerca
Ella pide en silencio un deseo
Cuando desde el cielo se cae una estrella

Ella tiene mi amor para siempre
Y sabe que nada yo creo de esas
Pero cruza los dedos besando
Y pide que nunca yo viva sin ella

Ella cruza los dedos besando
Aunque sabe que nunca viviría sin ella

Tratando de encontrar
Tratando de acertar
En que dedo va el anillo

Como remar en la arena

Como volar bajo tierra

En decirme con tu cuerpo lo
Que tu mirada grita

Solo dime que me amas
Dime que me amas dímelo ya
No soporto más tu silencio
Solo dime que me amas
Dime que me amas dímelo ya
Estoy loco con tanto misterio
Terminemos con todo este juego

Voy dando saltos por la vida
Tratando de arribar
Tratando de llegar
Hasta ese lugar prohibido
Al centro de tu sitio

Y la sonrisa dulce de mamá

Sabe lo que quiere y llegará
A dirigir películas y actuar
En cines de verdad
A iluminar a los demás

Ella cuida mi vida
Ella es poesía, belleza natural
Sabes todos los días
Cuido su vida como ángel guardián

Como la muchacha ojos de papel
Es reina del derecho y del revés
Y siempre está en mí
Aunque no esté sentada aquí

Y no hay modo de verme en la vida
Sin tu mirar

Y llévame a tu lugar yo llegaré a despertarte
Con el sol que en tu mirada brillará
Y llévame a tu lugar yo llegaré con la luna
Y mientras duermas yo estaré a la par

Te llevo y al tocarte yo siento
Que no hay bella durmiente en tu piel al desear
Te llevo y contigo en mi aliento
No reposa el guerrero de mi hambre sexual

Te llevo cuando voy, cuando vengo
Cuando quiero y no encuentro
Cuando puedo y tu estás
Y no hay modo de verme en la vida
Sin tu mirar

Por no lastimar tus ojos

Yo quiero darte amor
Simplemente amor
Yo quiero darte todo mi amor
Y estar contigo

Yo no busco más de ti
De lo que pudieras darme
Yo quiero estar a tu lado
Y poder mirar tu silencio

Yo no quiero que me ames
Sí vas a empañar tu brillo
A mí me basta ser tu piedra
No ser tu piel, ni tu río

Y descubrir juntos un nuevo cielo
Y hacer cumplir todos tus sueños
Yo quiero construir un amor eterno
Y compartir cada momento

Que nos unió, fui tan feliz
Te vas de aquí clavándome esta soledad

Tu eras de cristal
Si juntos frente

Y sea lo que sea el sol saldrá
Y tengas lo que tengas tu ser es más
La vida es una rueda y girara
Todo lo que se entrega nos volverá

Las ganas de reír
Detrás de ti, se va mi corazón

Sí pudiera llevarte a volar

Sí pudiera entregarte mi amor
Sí pudiera curarte las heridas

Como la luz sin la oscuridad
Como forzar el amor
Como la risa sin lágrimas

Axel,"Cuando hablas de más, cuando dices no
Cuando sos infiel, cuando nada das 
Te vuelve

Cuando haces llorar, cuando discutís
Cuando te crees mejor que todos
Vuelve

Cuando haces la paz, cuando gracias das
Cuando abrazas a un enfermo
Siempre vuelve

Cuando compartís, cuando sonreís
Cuando das sin esperar
También te vuelve

Vuelve
Todo lo que das la vida te devuelve
Cuando haces el mal te vuelve

Cambiar tu mundo
Ni pretendo que haya paz en tu planeta

De ti no temas

Te doy mis fuerzas
Nada puede detenernos si te entregas

Sólo en ti veras la felicidad
Sólo vive el ahora no pierdas más tiempo
Hay mucha vida por caminar

Siempre volverá el amor que das
Ya no busques afuera no hay nada que pueda
Mostrarte lo que en ti no hay
Sólo en ti está la verdad

No pretendas de mi salvación
No soy quien piensas
Tú eres tu estrella

No te hundas en lo que pasó
No des más vueltas
Es momento de que eleves tu conciencia

Quédate es tuya mi voluntad
Tú lo más profundo entre mis sueños y mi realidad
De tu mano quiero caminar
Solo quédate

Ha pasado mucho tiempo ya
Y estoy cansado de adivinar
No puedo más
Haces todo para enamorar, solo por vanidad
Vienes y vas, ya no se qué esperas de mi
No quiero jugar
Tan solo estar junto a ti

Quédate mata esta soledad y a esta espera dale un final
Quédate es tuya mi voluntad

Solo déjame hacerte feliz

Axel,"Quiéreme de trotamundos no me amarres a tu lado 
Que la vida no es de mármol, es del cosmos y es de piel

Que prefiero ser tus alas a ser clavo en tu pared 

Quiéreme tan insegura 
Como puedas y lo aguanten tus encantos 
Quiéreme como tu quieras 
Pero no me dejes de querer

Quiéreme con todo y punto, sin siquiera meditarlo 
Como aman los gitanos siempre al filo del placer 
Quiéreme con mis delirios, con los puesto y sin dudarlo 
Que no quiero ser tu agua sino el fuego en que has de arder 

Quiéreme tan insegura 
Como puedas y lo aguanten tus encantos 
Quiéreme como tu quieras 
Pero no me dejes de querer

Quiéreme por dos minutos o por cien eternidades 
Y sabrás que a ese instante nunca más lo olvidaré 
Quiéreme hasta perderme pero nunca hasta olvidarme 
Que en el feeling del reencuentro simplemente te diré

Como puedas y lo aguanten tus encantos 
Quiéreme como tu quieras

Si lo crees, lo crearás

Todo da vueltas, todo gira y el mundo va 
Empieza y termina sin final 
Da vueltas la vida 
Y si va bien o va mal

Y sobran los motivos para festejar 
Recuerdos de un futuro sin tiempo

Axel Rudi Pell,"We're sailing on the waves of the ocean,
The gallow's dangling in the wind

The god of the sea is showing his real face,
As the slaves try to tame the raging waves

We're riding on the wind and the sea is turning red,
We fight the fire of hate, black banners for the dead

No walking on water,
We're the prisoners of the sea,
The devil's daughter,
A game between her and me

The sea will be our grave and we're running out of time
But we're searching for our little peace of mind.",Prisoners Of The Sea
Axel Rudi Pell,"They're called the fools of the sixteenth century,
They lived in fear and were lost in misery,
Deep in the night there was something going on,
Rats ran away and the specters came along

They're locked in chains, the innocent victims,
Dreaming of turning to dust,
They're prisoners in time, bewitched by the wizard,
The evil will not come to rest

They turned to stone,
There was no coin in the wishing well,
They turned to stone,
Caught by a spell

The king told the crowd, not to touch the mystic stone,
But they lit the candles in the mystic danger zone,
They had no chance to escape from the rising force of the oath,
Caught in the light of death.",Turned To Stone
Axel Rudi Pell,"Silent night, we saw the rainbow in the sky
Filled with hope, ready to cry

Early morning, and the strangers sailed away
We don't want another day
We looked for truth, for the reasons of our fate
All reply we got was hate yeiyeah

The black light's calling, and the moon eclipsed the sun
Endless dreams nowhere to run
We tried to get out, we're lost under the gun
In the chance waiting for dawn

Burning candles, the smoke filled up the air
We called the fire, to help us there
Kings and queens, the illusions of our dreams
Surrounded by the fear, that the end is coming near

All we need is the answer (the answer answer)
From the lost world of home (home home home...)
And we pray till the morning

I can hear you screaming, oh Lord they have to pray
Can you feel the wind blows, cold sweat runs down your face
The children died of hunger, a human disgrace

We been losing our mind
At the end of our time

They sailed across the universe, from heaven down to earth
Riding on the ship of fools, the walls will be diturbed
They're on their way to hell and back, the legions of the glory
They're coming home, they touched the
Light, in the misty morning

We been losing our mind
At the end of our time

The cry of the nations, a lake of silent screams
It turned out to be broken dreams
Imprisoned in chains (and) don't know what it means
Locked up in a cage of broken dreams

A cloud filled up with water (is) falling from the sky
The wizard cried, the demon danced, sure they don't know why
The desert storm takes over now the labyrinth of sin
Holy nights of dangerous games, will they ever win

We been losing our mind
At the end of our time

The cry of the nations, a lake of silent screams
It turned out to be broken dreams
Imprisoned in chains (and) don't know what it means

Axel Rudi Pell,"The death of a clown
Reminds you all lifetime,
A lake full of tears
Overflowed the world.

The reaper brought pain,
So sad are the children,
Their time of mourning
Will be forever.

Where did he go,
No laughter in heaven,
Where did he go,
Where did he stay?

The clown is dead,
The laughter is gone,
The clown is dead,
A life's on the run.

Behind his mask, 
He was only human,
A person who feels
Like you and me.

Can't you see the light,
The star that shined so bright,
Was it a lucky sign,
From someone who says ""I'm alright""

The clown is dead
Will the laughter return
We'll never know

Tears, death, heaven, pain...",The Clown Is Dead

Not a shotgun in his hand
And he walked across the water
To reach the promised land

Telling love's so hard to find

Catch the storm
Don't wait until the dawn
Catch the storm
Without you I feel so sad,
Feel so sad

There were endless days and nights
Where our love turned into ice
But the flame's inside still burnin'

We called the eyes of the rainbow
To free us from our sins
We searched the night for all lost promises
A fight we couldn't win",Come Back to Me

Hding back from a nightmare.
Endless circles, so how could I know
Is it true (or) should I care

Fantasy is the name of the game,
Brings you passion and pain, 
Moving pictures runnin' fast and slow
Gonna drive you insane.

What about tomorrow, 
When the dreams become reality, 
The nights full of sorrow, 
A game between youand me

Of the souls of the undead in the midnight hour

Hide your skin and your bones,
Beware of all dark in the night

It's magic,
Burning symbols on the wall,

'cause tomorrow never comes,
Oh lord, they have to pray,
That no evil's coming out of the rotten swamp

Their whispered dream to turn the key, an evil laugh
And they knew, they will be restrained",Magic

Axel Rudi Pell,"Looking back at your own
Life lost life, which once was so strong
You ruined your body, toxic indication
Back to the wall, too weak to rock the nation

Looking up to the sun in the sky
To higher places, but I don't want to die

Strong as a rock
On the edge to the sky
Strong as a rock
See the angels fly
Strong as a rock
The abyss calls out your name
Strong as a rock

The monkey on your back, cold turkey's coming home

Back in rehab, last try of despair",Strong as a Rock
Axel Rudi Pell,"Long ago in the enchanted land
They lived in fear and had a hard stand

In the distance beyond the sundown
Down to the world of purgatory
Holy night, the cry of the angels
They chose the one, the one to kill the king

They'd been living in a nightmare
In a world of hate and full of despair

Take the crown
And take your life in your own hands
Drawbridge down
The night of the demon dance
Take the crown
We're fighting united
Turn it down
Down to the ground

On and on they fought till dawn
The chosen lords of doom
Going down down down the knights are around
Till the rising of the moon

Axel Rudi Pell,"In the distance from far away
I can hear your voice, the words that you say

The shield of love has broken, you're fire has been gone

Axel Rudi Pell,"On a cloudy night
I looked outside the window
Seeing faces disappear
The wheels of time kept turning
Through endless days and nights
I'm hiding my soul from the light

Holding on to the two sides of a coin
I'm blinded by lies
Too late to return
Late at night the fire starts to burn
I'm a Prisoner of flames
Will I ever learn

We're falling in and outta love
Calling our hearts
Tears from heaven

chorus:
Don't say goodbye
Love is forever
And I need you to stay

Don't say goodbye
We're so strong together
Don't leave me this way



On and on we searched for Fool's Gold
Putting down the trigger of love
Any chance we had is passing by
Just too late for another try

Lonely hearts lost fires in the night
The end of our romance's in sight

Sailing on through the oceans of time

Life is unreal, in the darkest dreams

Can't find our way through silent screams
Searching for the way to go
Too blind to realize
Our way will lead through fire 'n ice
Dreamings of paradise, prophecies of scary nights

Through the fog, a long time to go
Out in the cold, but still feel the fire

Why does anything last forever?
Two hearts on fire belongs together

You touching my soul forever
You touching my soul
And my love will carry on

Love awaited portion, I'm leaving the truth behind
My restless heart is beating for the love I will find
A look in the mirror, there is magic in the air
Soon I will win my fight, my final despair

Why does anything last forever?
Two hearts on fire belongs together

You touching my soul forever
You touching my soul
And my love will carry on

The fire is burning is written on your face

You touching my soul forever
You touching my soul
And my love will carry on",Touching My Soul
Axel Rudi Pell,"One night, out of nowhere
Came a shimmering light
Flowers were fading, leaving us cold
(And)
Alone in the night

Dark clouds, the storm kept on turning
Where's the final sign
Invisible masks, burning bridges were falling
Will we all leave behind

Whispers from the forgotten tale
And the wind cries out your name

How long will it take to remember
Are we too blind to see
Hold on to the dream or surrender
We ain't gonna win
In this gamble of sin

Holding on, the walls kept on breaking
Resolving to dust
The curse og the chains causing evil and pain
How long will it last

Whispers from the forgotten tale
And the wind cries out your name

How long will it take to remember
Are we too blind to see
Hold on to the dream or surrender
We ain't gonna win
In this gamble of sin

Whispers from the forgotten tale
And the wind cries out your name

How long will it take to remember
Are we too blind to see
Hold on to the dream or surrender
We ain't gonna win
In this gamble of sin
",Ain't Gonna Win
Axel Rudi Pell,"I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
Well it goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, then the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
And she tied you to a kitchen chair
And she broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, maybe there's a God above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
Well it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not someone who's seen the light
It's a cold and broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Axel Rudi Pell,"Once upon a time, in a land of the sun
Soldiers were dying, under the gun

The people were screaming in a place of no return
With a strike of their hand, they'll make you burn

We know we crossed the line
Cursed by the spell, runnin' out of time
Sending shivers down the spine
Only time will tell, if we'll live or die,
We'll live or we'll die

Run on the edge of tomorrow, cryin' in the rain
Whipping burning chains
Winnin' and losing in pain, is the part of the game
Whipping burning chains

The heroes were falling, died by the sword

Getting rid of all the fools, hidin' bodies in the sand
Heading for tomorrow, to the promised land",Burning Chains
Axel Rudi Pell,"On the loose, but hearin' gunfire
To time to cruise, leaving for our destiny
Cold hearted city, don't wanna stay
Undeserving of pity, better get out our way

Out of the dark and into the light
Moving shadows, full moon on the rise

I wanna know, where we have to go
A thunderous roar, we're changing times
I wanna know, where we have to go
A thunderous roar, we're changing times

All roots of evil, appearing at once
Don't dance with the devil, cause you'll have no chance",Changing Times
Axel Rudi Pell,"On the horizon there's a starlight
Shining down to the world
They're hiding faces in the daylight
Movin' on, like a bird

A dream or just a fantasy
No returnin'
Heading into tomorrow, far away

Flyin' high above
Runnin' fast as an arrow
Flyin' high above
On the wings of a rainbow

Where the eagle meets the condor
Through the thunders, wind and rain
People are sayin' there'll be peace on earth
All their prayers were not in vain",High Above
Axel Rudi Pell,"What did you see Can you believe it?
All fallen heroes forever gone
The eternal lights died out in it's shadows
Brought back some memories when evil ruled the world

No fear, the sun will never fade
One more pray to heaven

We're sailing in
In the burnin' sea

Into the storm
Into the storm

Follow the ship, sail on the oceans
Dark stormy nights, aimless victims of the sea
Life's on the edge, fadin' lost and gone
Trying to break free, but something's goin' wrong

Round and round in circles, in a place of no return
The captain is in sorrow, the sails started to burn
As we passed the border, to a new and different world
The northern lights kept shining, but the tale's left unhead
Far away, far away",Into the Storm
Axel Rudi Pell,"I wanna know, where did you go, to which part of the city
I kept moving, struggling around to find you in all laces

City lights turned out in all darkness
Strangers are lost, just searching around
Way down in the chamber of life
Blocked out, just tryin' to survive

Left all alone, but they had to be strong

Coming from nowhere, and the candle lit the shadows
We're coming home, we're on our way
Coming from nowhere, and the lightning hit the shadows
Still have a long, long way to go
A long way to go

They disappeared, contact lost, when did you leave?
The tide is turning, waves are high, overflowing the shore

High and low, no feel to surrender
The wind just blows the rain in my face
Ramblin' on to the bridge of forever
Holy grail, no time to disgrace",Long Way To Go
Axel Rudi Pell,"I keep on lookin' down to the sea
And I realize there's a life for you and me
The higher we climb, the harder we fall
Searchin' for a new world, for you and for all

Coming out of the shadows, hunting all without fear
Fallin' down to the ground, whising they'd disappear
Livin' all life in danger, getting out of control
Afraid of the dark, losin' one's soul

Forever? However, things must come to and end

We're hidin' the sun, we're on the run
And touching heaven
We're losing our minds, the stars never shine
We're touching heaven

Just don't dream of tomorrow, wavin' flaps in the air
On top of the world or in depths of despair
Shinin' bright in all glory, silent screams in the night
Runnin' high and low, in this neverending fight",Touching Heaven
Axel Rudi Pell,"What can you hear? Can you believe it?
Should we remember all the words outta your mouth?
Livin' a lie, no guts, no glory
No sign to surrender, you're the devil in disguise

Expect no mercy
You are responsible
We're looking ahead
On the train to tomorrow

Oh
Catch your wounded pride
High above
In your tower of lies
Oh
You're on a never ending ride
High above
In your tower of lies

Is it all true? Drawing conclusions
All of your stories, we're passing in review
A liar's not believed, even when he speaks the truth
You stand convicted, leaving you in loneliness",Tower of Lies
Axel Rudi Pell,"The first time we met, our heaven was on fire 
My burning heart was aching, unfulfilled desire 
I'd been a fool in longing for your love 
The magic is gone, we 're livin' out of touch

Did you ever sing in the rain?
have you ever felt the pain?

Crossing the line on the edge of our time 
Searching for words, when truth hurts 
Our love was so strong, but now it s lost and gone 
Searching 'for words, when truth hurts

You're gone with the wind, leaving shadows of love 
Our whispering hearts were torn apart",When Truth Hurts
Axel Rudi Pell,"I wandered down the pathway, through the misty moor
Like I knew he did a thousand times before
Voices seem to echo ""Come talk with me a while
Just around the corner, just another mile...""

I had heard the stories, her legend served her well
A mystic's myth or fable, truth or fairy tale
A raggle taggle gypsy , with a toothless smile
Said ""Sit with me my darling, let's talk a little while""

And the road goes on, seeming ever longer on the 
Way to Mandalay
And the road goes on, forever I will wander on the 
Way to Mandalay

The mile went on forever, the minutes turned to days
Could I have been misguided by the mystic's ways?
The moment lasts forever, at least it does for me
Caught between what happened and what could never be",Way To Mandalay [*]

Axelle Red,"A menudo me pregunto
""Por qué tanto luchar?
""Por qué querer saberlo todo?
""Por qué intentar cambiar?
En busca de la perfección
Si no consigo avanzar, ni puedo parar
Sirve de qué, el sentimiento aquél, de qué
Yo me noto al revés, de tanto ver mi mundo al revés
Más preguntas ya no me inventaré, no, sirve de qué
Si de noche me atormento
Me culpo solo a mí
Con la felicidad yo sueño

Me estigmatizo así
De autodefensa me embriagué
Pero ni me emborraché, ni me desahogué
Sirve de qué, el sentimiento aquél, de qué
Sirve de qué, el capricho breve que me daré
El cansarme de dorarme la piel, no, sirve de qué, sirve de qué
Busca tu suerte, intenta ser fuerte
Tu conciencia que conteste, le pese a quien le pese

Ya no quiero saber, sirve de qué",Sirve de Que

Me mandaban a callar, ya te recuperarás

Busca lo positivo en tí, no será, créeme, tan infantil

But not those awful days
When you're a man without grace
A soldier without a face

About blood on glorious shoes
About a million killing hands
About lonely dying friends
And every night you hear them cry
And in your dreams you see them die
Up to this day you see their eyes open wide

And with only memories left
In those moments full of pain
You feel like you're goin' insane

The bad dreams still resist
No one can imagine this-you know
When their thoughts are as white as snow
But in a war all the snow is red
Red with blood of all the dead
Only one thought lets you live on
Through those days

Forget your hostility
Join together with me
Now it's time for a fight against

Get down - from the throne in the light
Get down - to stay right by my side

The good old times are gone
When we used to live in their hearts
But they've forgotten their beliefs
They live in a house of cards

I've always trusted in our might
That I'm the dark and you're the light
I see their future - you see it too

But you get no time for rest
'Cause you wanna be the best
You give everything

This is a rock 'n' roll paradise
And I hope it will never end
But when we finish our tour
And the last day has come
I will cry again, again, again and again

Gimme back - gimme what I want

Gimme back - gimme back the paradise

So many different places
So many different faces
Things are strange and new
And when I look behind
The pictures in my mind
Makes me feel
As if I drank a witches' brew

Gimme more from this drink
It's a help for me to think
About all that I've seen
And I've learnt this time
Music changes every mind
Everywhere I've ever been

This is a rock 'n' roll paradise
And I hope it will never end
But when we finish our tour
And the last day has come

Is bursting out of their hearts

The rollin' stream lights up the night
I close my eyes and begin to dream
Just listening to the noise of the engine's stream
The engine's stream

In a murderous heat I wake up
Afraid I realize the train won't stop
I'm sceared - my panic rises more and more
When I read the golden letters on my compartment door

Heaven's 7th train - no way back again
Hear the nightnares yell
In the train of your farewell
Of your farewell

Am I alive or am I dead?
Can I belive what I just read?
A prisoner of this rollin' cell
Am I in a dream on my way straight to hell?

Heaven's 7th train - no way back again
Hear the nightnares yell
In the train of your farewell
Of your farewell
Of your farewell
Or your farewell

Axxis,"The day is gone - tears in your eyes
Now I know what I never realized
You're alone and I'm far away
I hear your voice - calling me day by day
Day by day

From show to show - from town to town
There's no rest - sometimes I feel bound
Ups and downs all the way
That put pur love to the test everyday

I want you - you want me - dreams come true
I want you - you want me - dreams come true

I keep on waiting for the day
We will live together
Belive me when I say...
...that love doesn't know any distance

I'm longing for a place with you
Belive in me - our dreams will come true
Now I try to build up what I'm aiming for
Please be patient - I don't want anymore

I want you - you want me - dreams come true
I want you - you want me - dreams come true

I keep on waiting for the day
We will live together
Belive me when I say...
...that love doesn't know any distance

At any time and any place
I feel your love - I see your smiling face
Tyring to understand...

...that love doesn't know any distance
I want you - You want me - dreams come true





",Love Doesn't Know Any Distance
Axxis,"No advice
Open up your eyes
Don't you realize that we live our lives
No advice

Nothing on my mind - day after day
Always party woth my friends - that's my way
We're nobody's fools when we hit the town
Turnin' our lives up side down

We're curisin' around - looking for fun
We're not wasting our time - always on the way
We need a rest from people who don't realize
'Cause we don't need nobody trying to moralize

Livin' for each other - We're got our peace of mind
Just livin' for each day and we need, need, need

No advice - Open up your eyes - don't you realize
That we live our lives
No advice - You'd better wise up and realize
That we live our lives
No advice, no advice...

We hate people telling us how to live
'Cause they've learned how to take, but not to give
But we think, ""Who cares?!"" - We're thick skinned
We make our own decisions - free like the wind

Livin' for each other - We're got our peace of mind
Just livin' for each day and we need, need, need

No advice - Open up your eyes - don't you realize
That we live our lives
No advice - You'd better wise up and realize
That we live our lives

Axxis,"Every day
I sweated away
I got up early in the morning to earn my daily bread

Dud everything
All they said
But the more I did the more I got mad

Didn't like that life
Yeah, I was young
But at this time me dreams had begun

I wanted to be
Forever free
So I gave up this life to take the road

Oh... road to never-neverland
Even you can't see an end - it's not far away
Oh... road to never-neverland
Just goin' straight to reach the end - it's not far away

Every day - I play guitar
Just to stay alive - not to be a star
I'm not rich - but I'm not poor
Beacause I've got a freedom now that makes me feel secure
Ups downs all on my way
But I hold out to the last 'cause I wanna stay
On the road that never ends
To reach me dreams - my own never-neverland

Oh... road to never-neverland
Even you can't see an end - it's not far away
Oh... road to never-neverland
Just goin' straight to reach the end - it's not far away





",Road to Never Neverland
Axxis,"Time, will show us a better day
A better day we both could use
I know there's no other way
Another way we both would lose

So here we are, again
Woman and man
With our hearts, in hand
Sinkin' in the sand

Stay don't leave me, don't turn away
Love will prove what friend are for

Stay don't leave me, don't turn away
Love will prove what friend are for
What friend are for

Life, plays like a funnt game
A twisted rain, falls while we pray
I belive, we will love again
And 'till the end we both will stay

But here we are, again
Tyrin' to understand
What went wrong, we long
Cryin' out our song

Stay don't leave me, don't turn away
Love will prove what friend are for

Stay don't leave me, don't turn away
Love will prove what friend are for
What friend are for

Here we are again
Woman and man
With our hearts, we long
Cryin' out our song

Stay don't leave me, don't turn away

",Stay Don't Leave Me
Axxis,"Night Time - shrouded in mystery
The mist, the fog - there is nothing to see
Full moon - shining down on earth
Now, tonight - starts the forbidden
Starts the forbidden birth

Gruesome - howlin' to the moon
A creature - is on the hunt, the hunt
Somewhere - deep inside the man
A beast, awakes - undercover of the night

It cannot stop and there's no way out
The wolf possesses the man
It's howlin' loud

When the wolf prowls
When the wolf prowls
When the wolf prowls
When the wolf prowls

The wolf...

A man, a wolf - one body and one soul
Belong, together - for all eternity
A man, a beast - you know it's really true
Deep inside - the wolf is you
The wolf is you

All of your nightmares become reality
You know the wolf is in you
The wolf is in me

When the wolf prowls
When the wolf prowls
When the wolf prowls
When the wolf prowls

It cannot stop and there's no way out

It's howlin' loud

You know the wolf is in you
The wolf is in me

When the wolf prowls

Born with guilt, shame on me

I can't escape the hand of the past

Aya,"Been a while now that I've looked the other way.
So many hours spent alone that I can't turn away,
a little lie can build a high and mighty wall between us.

When the time arrives and hopes begin to fade,
[night's long giveway?] to friends ya missed from better days.
I left the lights on once to often now it turns out I can see.

This final song will have to be all,
cause there's no one listening after the curtain call.

Used to think of all the things that we could share.
Little house filled with our dreams and we were happy there,
but when the fall arrived these curtains couln't keep the cold from me.

Everytime I cried and prayed that things could change,
the fans reminded me of who I'd been before you came.
I take a moment to remember what it felt like to be free.

This final song will have to be all,
cause there's no one listening after the curtain call.

This final song will have to be all,
cause the lights go down after the curtain call.

This final song will have to be all,
cause I feel how I used to feel before the things went wrong.

This final song will have to be all,
cause there's no one listening after the curtain call.

Sometimes I think I hear the applause,
But this house is empty after the curtain call.

And there was nothing that you couldn't do
But if every day was an easy day

You ever had a day
When tomorrow didn't count
'Cause you were caught up in the moment
On cloud nine without a doubt

You ever had a day
When you knew yesterday was gone
And there was nothing that even mattered
'Cause you already knew you won

But what about those days
When you just don't understand
And just when you're getting up
It seems you're falling down again

What about those times
When it's not so easy to believe
When doubt causes you to only
Go by what you see

Don't you wish that every day was an easy day
And there was nothing that you couldn't do
But if every day was an easy day
You'd never be able to say that Jesus brought you through

Only if every day was an easy day

A little too much time on your hands
So many things pressing your heart

And the winds are tearing you apart

And what matters the most now
Shouldn't matter at all
You forgot who's holding you up
And He won't let you fall

Who's in control of your life
And knows better than you ever will
Who tells you time and again
Hush and be still

It's time you recognize
Your answer lies in His eyes
Where the river flows
And if you'll just

Free your mind
And the peace of God will follow
Won't you give yourself a little time?
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow

Don't you know that His joy is your strength
Can you fathom it?
Peace beyond your understanding
When you gonna grab a hold of it

'Cause you're life's not your own
You can't do it alone
There is a remedy
If you will let go and just

Free your mind
And the peace of God will follow
Won't you give yourself a little time?
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow

And so if you just free your mind
The peace of God will follow
Won't you give yourself a little time?
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, no, no

Don't you know just thinking about it
Ain't gonna add one hour
Tell me who's in control

Don't you know thinking about it
Ain't gonna add one hour
Tell me who's in control

You gotta free your mind

Ayiesha Woods,"I learned a long time ago that not everyone is on my side
Had to figure out that life was more than trying to get by
Had my hopes and dreams trampled on and laid to the side
But I survived

Because of Your love I don't have to be afraid anymore
Because of Your love I'm stronger than I ever was before
And I could do anything, I can do anything, it's true
It's all because of You

You inspire me to live with every breath that You give
And I don't know what I would do if it wasn't for You
You're the reason for my songs

Took the hardest round that life could bring
Stressing it, worrying
Crying 'bout every doggone thing

Back to the wall, slow to the crawl
Steady falling or so it seems
Life is hard, can leave a scar
But that don't mean it's gotta stay that way

We can let it break us down
Or we can turn it back around, only get stronger

If we don't walk away
Stand on up and fight this thing
Don't run from the pain
Grit your teeth and take a swing

Sometimes we get saved by the bell
But those times when it don't go so well
We gotta stand up and fight for it
We gotta stand up and fight for it

Just so you know you're not alone
The promise says you can do all things
It's up to you  what you gonna do
You can't lose if you've got his strength

To add to that I've got your back
Better believe I'm down for the ride
Big or small keep pressing on
And everything is gonna be alright

We can let it break us down
Or we can turn it back around, only get stronger

If we don't walk away

Ayiesha Woods,"He left her hanging at the end of her rope
No ultimatum, nowhere to go
It's nothing new, it happens everyday
Love is a gift that we just throw away

It's like a never ending cycle of selfishness
When will we ever see past this darkness
Lord please open our eyes to realize that

Love can't wait
We've got to see the urgency
And love is all it takes
To light the flame in you and me

You see her crying on the world news
Would it be different if she was you?
It's the sad state of humanity
Becoming desensitized and hypnotized, tell me

What kind of world will we live in if we don't change?
I see the writing on the front page, last days
We cry open our eyes to realize that

Love can't wait
We've got to see the urgency
And love is all it takes
To light the flame in you and me

It only takes a spark to make
A flame that burns around the world
From you to me, from me to them
Lord ignite this heart again

Let me explain how I feel about you
First it's to easy to say I need, I love you
I will try to describe what I mean, how it feels like
For that, I use worked melodies sinceres
You were my heaven on earth, the light of myself
Through you I gave birth, you made me a woman
Every colour of my world, that's what you are
Like a lion rules the jungle you rule my heart

Thank you
You turn my nights into days
Cause every second and a minute of each hour I need to see your face

Grateful for everything I have
And I know I should be less doubtful

I'm in a big hole surrounded by fear
I'm in a deep dark hole
Deep enough for me to disappear
But should I go if earth the only place I know
All I know is I don't want this anymore
Livin' out life without nowhere what a distant is searching for

There are days where I would love to be somebody else
Days where I am fighting myself
There are days where I wish I would be a child again
And sometimes days where I wish they wouldn't last
Days where I wish I would be dead

Step back, stay away from me
Can't you respect that I only need my peace
These days I'm too weak to see
These days I'm all about me
I don't want to talk this out
'Cause there are certain things we don't need to talk about
The silence in between will let you know what I mean
And each time I try to escape
I pray to go not to let me fake
And to take my doubts away

It wasn't easy but you always fought for your family

One kiss and I can't breathe
One touch I'm suffocating
Get me out I can't breathe
Afflicted feelings I should hide
There was a thousand warnings
Thought this devotion I'd deny
I turn to things that harm me

You're a disease
Sweet tasting rabies
You suck the life right out of me
Set me free

I think of nothing all the time
Sometimes it's nothing but you
You shouldn't mean a thing to me
This shouldn't be
A stabbing pain stuck in my side
Not sure why I adore you
A strangled chocking little cry
I would do all things for you

Leave me be
Set me free
You're a disease and you spread this on to me.",Disease

I hope I'm dead, just for my sake
Who knew all this would come, from a dirty gun
Son of a bitch who thought he was a cowboy

Look into his eyes to see where evil lives
Bullet through window, and down the rabbit hole
This is one fucked up fairy tale

Hey you! Black and blue,
Don't end up like Alice
Hey you! Black and blue,
Watch out, you'll end up like Alice

You'll get what's coming, you and your children
The wicked witch has OD'ed on pills again
And the Dragon, lights up a cigarette
He's blowing smoke right into your face again
It's off with her head, her snakes are seething
The big bad wolf is rabid and teething
Bullet through window, and down the rabbit hole
This is one fucked up fairy tale

Hey you! Black and blue,
Don't end up like Alice
Hey you! Black and blue,
Watch out, you'll end up like Alice

She's slapped around, choked and drowned

You look the other way
You saw me falter 
For one second of the day
Why am I so invisible to you?
Sometimes I hate you more 
Than you could ever hate yourself

But I love you, 
Would do anything for you
You don't even see 
That I'm in pain
Frustration became humiliation
Waiting outside for you 
In the pouring rain

What's left 
Of my self worth you 
Crushed it in your hand
Wicked game to torture me 
Because you can
You toy with me then pull back
We're never synched in time, 
We blew that
The sad thing I've done the same 
Before to someone else

I tried so hard to be someone, 
I never was nobody
I tried too hard to play this game, 
I never was the winner

Whole lotta things done changed
Yeah, there's a lot of people puttin' black eyes in the game
Knahmean, time to do this though

Check it, I had a block locked, but took a fall now I'm off my feet
I gotta eat, so it's back to these fuckin' streets
And I will grow 'cause I'm an old timer
I bring the drama to any nigga, his babies or his fuckin' mama
I got a look like Tevin Campbell
But still I gamble, hustle and scramble
'Cause money is muscles in this damn zoo
And in order to make it, you gotta take it
Be the boom, blast booze, bend or break it but don't fake it
That's why there's no guilt for these trife niggas bloods I spilt
Took what they built, flippin' they drug game on tilt
'Cause in New York, dealin' drugs is a sport
You either sell it, smoke it, shoot up or snort, either way you're caught
And since I'm in it, now I'm in it to win it; sky's is the limit
No more being some motherfucker's lieutenant
Shit, from this point that's how I feel, I wanna fly
Yeah, it's either doe or die

Love, kickin' that gang shit, sellin' on the same strip
Hustlin' hard, no matter how much we hated
So dedicated, even our dreams are drug related
Shit, puff bananas, not even the cops can stand us
'Cause of the way we vanish, everytime they come to can us
25 we get the money live, fuck all that funny jive
The streets is our only source to survive
And before any teeny-boppers think about tryin to stop us
I rather put your head, through the propellers of a helicopter
'Cause all my peeps be playin' for keeps
Straight out the litter, so bitter
These bandits don't even need sweets
Bringin' the ruckus, like some mad motherfuckers
Move at night like truckers
When suckers see us, they duck us

A fat connect with a kingpin Colombian
Plus props from crooked cops, payin' him tops not to run me in
Keepin my toaster in a shoulder holster
Havin' hoes playin' me closer, sexin' on a silk sofa
Livin' the life of the rich and trife
Rugged but sharp like a kitchen knife
Without stress from some bitchin wife
What a life, that's why I be on what I be on
Always ready to war for a score that's sure to put me on
And until then, I won't seal in what I'm feelin
It was inside that I cried, but now its spillin
I'm goin all out, until I fallout, so much of a menace
When I finish milkin New York I'll have to fall out
On the run, cause I know feds'll try to knock me
And railroad my soul to a hellhole if they got me
But not me, I'm goin out fightin until I fry
From hot lead no lie, like I said it's either doe or die

Too much snake shit, even females be feedin off that fake shit
Filled with envy and hatred but my high helps me escape it

They had you wanted for warrants 'fore you get enourmous
Life's a performance so players play with endurance
Cos for more cents, any villain's willing to get more intense
They tried to break us but all it did was just make us
Travel across acres for papers, bonafide money takers
Cause though we know somehow we all gotta go
As long as we're leaving thieving, we'll be leaving with some kind of dough

Plus plea's, a hundred G's, I had me blockin' out of jail sentence
I'm recognized by the illest of individuals

But still skeptic on who I cling to
'Cause every single nigga that swing through ain't my man just 'cause we mingle
Too much snake shit, even females be feedin' off that fake shit
Filled with envy and hatred but my high helps me escape it
Temporarily, though it don't worry me
The wise verbally nourish me, properly with that inner city, urban GC
I fuck with those beyond my age bracket

Life's a performance so players play with endurance
'Cause for more cents, any villain's willing to get more intense
They tried to break us but all it did was just make us
Travel across acres for papers, bonafide money takers
'Cause though we know somehow we all gotta go
As long as we're leaving thieving, we'll be leaving with some kind of dough

Far from feeble, I leave your nostrils hard to breathe through

My whole persona's kinda laid back like a recliner
And since a minor, I been fucking with marijuana

Peep this uniqueness, non-believers I'm leaving speechless
Left to choke as if skunk smoke was coming through the speakers
Surgically nice with any verbal device, trife

Puffing trees to get me high as trapeze, looking Japanese
At ease when I'm stacking G's, so let's discuss, plus degrees
How the rhyme forces the source for thoughts that's lost

Betcha don't know what's goin on 
If you don't know, we're gonna show you, oooohhhh 
It's on now, New Year, pop the pain 
Sun blaze through the grey cloud, stop the rain 
Shear shirts by Chanel, baby, feel the breeze 
Drop top, me and shorty, while she be at my knees 
Let the wind blow, low fade, peep the glow 
Know my style from the foul days, keep it low 
Got new plans, worldwide, livin the life 
Any chick I make wife gon' shiver tonight 
Know the game, it's ups and downs learnin the ropes 
26 years of age, just learnin to cope 
Came a long way but still got so far to go 
So by now, I guess you know, talk to me 
Chorus (x2) 
What if we all had minds alike? Thought the same 
Only few was taught to get this, divorce the game 
Visualized as a young cat, saw the dream 
Get large, shit hard, and assorted CREAM 
So many came that I saw and went wise on my ways 
Made livin for me more intense, divided my days 
Weekends, party nights, raffled the stakes 
Love sophisticated women, those that rather you wait 
Tipped it off from the finest juice to 90 proof 
Rocked it all, from designer suits to climbin boots 
All in the summertime, workin the courts 
Lookin mommy wit them thick legs, hurtin them shorts 
So many ladies in the world today searchin for mates 
Got these non-players perpin for dates, hold up 
Give me love if you've got it in ya, hot as Virginia 
Hot enough for me to slide this up in ya 
Chorus (x2) 
Got the solar, Nat King Cole in his prime 
So behold that, shoes unfold in each rhyme 
Move accordin like the Chosen Ones roamin the Earth 
Gettin head until I'm dead, decompose in the dirt 
Play the same spot, bitch cast, lost it all 
Rollin dice and G you're better, now you forced to ball 
Havin fun at the main event, toastin cups 
Quarter pieces tryin to get yours roastin up 
Play the game if you got toys to match your words 
You a vet, throw your net, nigga, catch some birds 
Only a few left, still sincere, spread love 
Thank God, it's a heaven above, talk to me

Through my eyes, I'm all hood, fuck the fame

Verse 1: AZ
Yo, blesses to the young ones trapped in the world
Never hate the next man that be tappin your girl
It's just a hype, shoot anythings a man vision thru life
Help me to understand the chosen ones livin thru Christ
Blinded time from so many signs shown from greed
Tryin to calculate all the funds I blown from weed
Started out just a young shorty, wakin the rules
Turnin out to be the wise, educatin the fools
So many lost in these last days, closed curtains
Tryin to change from my past ways, I'm soul searchin
Diggin deep, tryin to feel within, it's real ill
Takin time just to chill with friends we still bill
Always told when I kick it with moms, to stay strong
Watch out for them bitches that's wicked, they play wrong
Keep your game strong, maintain yourself and live
Star bless the kids, soon sometin gotta give

Verse 2: AZ
You got to know when your end is near, I been there
Seen years disappear in thin air, nobody wins here
Swore on the population, we fightin blind
For sure, we need to stop the hatin, enlightin minds
Many die from a tragic death, in cold blood
Behoggin niggas lost or lack respect, show love
Sometime I wonder, was we ever free? High officials
they move so cleverly, don't ever sleep
 
Got my mind on the proverbs, ecclesiastics
These Bible words, so absurb, I read em backwards
They open doors, gave me a cause to stay swift
And reward, it gave me the sword to stay rich
Understandin is the best part, besides that
I fell-a off to a fresh start, no time to sidetrack
So much more still to come, it seems strange
I was much more iller young, but things change
Tryin to grow old, so many sights to see
Told it never fold, just more righteously, you know?
Chorus
Verse 3: AZ
I never knew any Bloods and Crips, but they exist
In New York, it's just thugs and clicks, we offer tips
Makin moves, tryin to stay afloat, it get deep
In these streets, you either stay or walk, or get beat
So strategise like the wise king, respect due
Brothers get high and let they mind scheme, I got Tek cool
In this world where so many stress, understand
ain't nuttin left but the thoughts of death, we're sons of man
So off track it's a shame to see, it's open season
Got police movin dangerously, for no reason
Hopin soon we can all adapt, get wise
It build lies, it was all a trap, in disguise
Assassinated by my own kind, so why ask
Because blacks to have a closed mind, deal with facts
Keep your eyes open, never rock yourself to sleep
Love to the East, let the dead rest in peace

New York, been infested by Bloods, lustin' for colors of red 
More black lies done shed through 
Yet the blood travelin' through veins remain blue 
Boned out until we zone out, no doubt 
Chickenheads beg for the nine inch Applehead 
Their legs open like fallopian, lubricated by petroleum 
Nine months later comes the ovary explosion 
Bitch you stupid? A hundred dollars you couldn't recoup it 
When I reign the truth on your brain you muted 
Rula Zig-Zag, Zig Allah, plus Allah Zig, Zag-Zig 
We addin' more knowledge to your wig 

[Chorus] 

(Word up, word up) Yeah (Wu-Tang, Firm up in this piece know what I mean?)
Holdin' it down stamp of approval, you know? (Get ya brain washed, you know what I'm sayin'? 
Get ya muscle tendered & straight) 
No doubt, no doubt

[Verse 1]
Nice and smooth, white knights, icey jewels
So cool, but the slightest shit ignite my fuels
Love it low, stay in mine, attach semi
Cuz its hard to enter rap just passin' by
XK8, it's all good, the next they hate
Was never the type of nigga that flexed his weight
See, frontin just ain't my forte, I'm all foreplay
Hoppin' out the porsche, drop products on graves
My slow grind story niggas cosign for me
Y'all slouch rappin' fake trash niggas' rhymes bore me
Adore me, respect niggas way before me
Since a shorty, in love wit big guns and orgies
Engaged to it, guzzlin' that beige fluid
Spazzin' like its the music that made me do it
Move through it if you that thorough, I'm certified
Through the grapevine, I know that niggas heard I'm live

[Verse 2]
Look, look, I be postered up like I'm toasted up nice
Stop niggas from gettin' killed, broken up fights
Blunted at the park jams, opened up mics
Now its on us, in the ??? I focus on right
Its hardball, now niggas can't call foul
Y'all can't get wit me, I can't fall now
Immune to the murderous plots
Been about it way before niggas heard I was hot
Heavy jewels, the type to keep the herb in the sock
A fresh pair, and I fuck wit them Germans a lot
Let's play, pop bottles like its no tomorrow
Ricky Ricardo, the young black Leonardo
Part Spanish, my robe'll make the dark vanish
Too complicated for y'all 85's, don't understand it
Respect game, there's rules as a criminal
So recognize I'm a five star general
You touchin' who

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yo, yo, at time its hard illin', it kinda scars the feelings
But what yall want from a game that's involved in millions
Cars, and chillin', sex wit' they broads, but villain
It could find a broke man, have him harm civilians
Its like a larson and razor blades but robbers spinnin'
Niggas runnin' from court tryna dodge they sentence
The odds is endless, moms can't calm the menace
Its like Saddam's in us, comin' fully armed for business
Chrome pubelies, smoke great, two tone seventies
Five miles on the same line, the zone is deadly
Hope heaven got a ghetto for us
In the hood, for the hustlers that bled before us
Weep slow, soak in, feel the Schweppervesence
Specialize foot notes for the adolescents
Locked in, there's beef in the game now
I know its deep but the streets know the name now
The war is on

[Chorus] 
",At Night
AZ,"(Verse 1)
Everybody want to take chills
It's either that or nigga want to play sales
Try tha floor when I bound wit a fake bill
When I see seven niggas I don't say shit
Motherfucker like me try to stay big
Who you got laying down in a ""stay there""
If a whips I can do it any kind of way
From this A to the Crist to the Chardonnay
Through the belt, from tha pipe to the parkway
Everything a nigga touch is like park-ay
Get it right, bill nigga let it light
From the stand though, two mil, living life
And this chicks from the streets better get it tight
Their pussy laid out better get it right
So where we at now

[Chorus: 2.5x]
AZ's back (come on)
(Where we at now?)

(Verse 2)
No niggas from both coast 
Everybody built pride but they hold toast
No joke, fuck co' but a whole load
Lone cones got bombs and .04s
'91 put cha stickers wit the low cone
Who's down getting' blunted and tryin' blow smoke
Take notes, love cars only one side
Always talk to blend in wit the young guys
Hustle up, play the block til the sunrise
Fuck wit us, bro', fuck you just gon' die
That's that, where are the real hard haters at?
Only who jack niggas sittin' back
Hit the broad, let 'em ball, nigga play it all
want to walk wit cha guns, nigga make the call
Where we at now?

(Verse 3)
Run away from the funny style,
Cut those fake niggas wit tha funny smile
Every hater in the game want to run me out
Everybody that's broke want to run their mouth
What that be about the time nigga see the cloud
Won't stop til every last dollar, we even now
Give it all back, bills in a small stack
Stack a whole lotta shit in the door crack
Where we at now?

[Chorus]

AZ,"I was destined to come, yeah
What you expect? I don't give a fuck now

As a clever nigga, nuttin' to play with

Thank God, he blew breath in my lungs

Urban wars, I was destined to come
(Dream Team, baby)
What you expect? I don't give a fuck now
(Fall back y'all)
As a clever nigga, nuttin' to play with
(I don't give a fuck)
Thank God, he blew breath in my lungs

I'm known global, blooded out pimp by coastal
Rap mobile, low key, anti-social
Smoke gray timbs, criss fade, wave to sin
White Denali, teared it up, flagrant rims

I'm no thief, I live by the code of the streets
I hold heat but no need to go in the deep
Don for real with the same Gotti traumata pill
Von O Niel, embraced by the arms of the ill

Art of war, a hundred men, cars galore
Wanted men, who couldn't see in robbin' the law?
Live or not, I'm one half divide the block
And I can show you how to take cash and bribe the cops

And from the bars to the backyards, alleys and aves
Subtract, divide, add up, tally the math
Stand direct, for dolo demand respect
Hand solo, sit back and watch the plans connect
You heard

I was destined to come
What you expect? I don't give a fuck now
As a clever nigga, nuttin' to play with
Thank God, he blew breath in my lungs

I was destined to come
What you expect? I don't give a fuck now
As a clever nigga, nuttin' to play with
Thank God, he blew breath in my lungs

I rock coogies but need fatigues, holdin' the cock oozie
The block school me, cuties drop your doobies
It's on now, some claim I'm wrong but how?
Been indited so watch, rhyme, pull on my trial

Blow with me, I'm like the life of that old 50
I dose quickly, moves is so shifty
Days been broke, on corners with them trays of Coke
It was the dirty hustle money that raised my folks

Tights from jail, few nigas might see bail
It's kinda foul when you watch nigga's wifies tell
Flip-on who? I still wore wrist on blue
Y'all know my style, MIA but I miss y'all too

Tryin' to remain breathin', hot blocks never change seasons
Bodies get caught for the strangest reasons
Breathe the smoke and time for me is needed to Coke
Won't stop till I stack it all and flee the coast

I was destined to come
What you expect? I don't give a fuck now
As a clever nigga, nuttin' to play with
Thank God, he blew breath in my lungs

I was destined to come
What you expect? I don't give a fuck now
As a clever nigga, nuttin' to play with
Thank God, he blew breath in my lungs

So now I toast, to all my close niggas that's ghost
Y'all know the sos, only soft niggas worry the most
Come and get me, niggas, I'm nasty like Ken Griffy
Nigga is sissies, I bought some men with me

Wait 'til the heny' hit me, hope that sin lift me
Never smile, style is wild, only grin strictly
Your main supplier, for days in the same attire
Sat and watch nigga, used to get again, expire

Deep in thought, spit it like a street report
I rep alone still I stand without no feet support
Fuck the threats, I rip necks of suckin' a tech
Either that or ice picks stuck in your neck

I play different, I put a work stay consistent
Love paper, plus a nigga praise commitment
Dead the jokes, I'm near when the bread get boast
So fuck me, ask your bitch who get head the most

I was destined to come
(You heard?)
What you expect? I don't give a fuck now
(Y'all niggas want? It's on)
As a clever nigga, nuttin' to play with
(It's time to y'all get it)
Thank God, he blew breath in my lungs
(The God has returned)

I was destined to come

What you expect? I don't give a fuck now

As a clever nigga, nuttin' to play with
Thank God, he blew breath in my lungs

",I Don't Give A Fuck
AZ,"I wanna toast, on behalf of y'all
'Cause the more we get, the more we takin'
From other people, baby
Brooklyn

Here's a toast to all the dons, dope fiends and hoes
Long cons, diamond rings and the kings that blow
To all the killas and the hustlas, some seem, some low
What the deal daddy, it's all good, get that dough

'Cause a y'all, I praise clothes, jewels and cars
Paid dues, been schooled but can't remove the scars
Boxed in, it's my life now, part of the game
On the streets with the hustlas, who hustle the same

Some of vein, let's toast to all the guns and the gangs
All the wheelchair victims and the one's with the chains
I'm numb to the pain, it's realness that runs through the vein
Becomin' sane, so many throwin' slumb in the game

So let us toast to the ones in memory of
All the jams we remember we love
We remember we thugs, Crips and Bloods
Latin Kings, Five Per centers, thieves and pimps because

Whatever makes the world go 'round, we down
And we'll react as this world go 'round, we lounge
So raise your cups to the real dogs that raised the pups
And all the young chicks finally at that age to fuck

The razor cuts, gun wounds that laid us up
From the beef and all the street sweaps that made us rough
Made some suck, some wasn't made to trust
Still I toast to the east coast, the stage is us

Throw it up for the niggas, that could, hold it up
Fold it up, if it's fast money, slow it up
The streets need it, it's gangsta when the beats get pleaded
Sleep, eat and breath it, it's the life, love it or leave it

To the playas and the hustlas, pimps and kings
Rich niggas sittin' on mils with ice in their rings
To the bitches and the real hoes, let's raise a toast
Show love, who could take paper the most

To the playas and the hustlas, pimps and kings
Rich niggas sittin' on mils with ice in their rings
To the bitches and the real hoes, let's raise a toast
Show love, who could take paper the most

So from the streets where the hustlin' brought us to life
From the beef and all the scufflin' that thought us to fight
The poisonous bikes, police gun wars in the night
The whores in the night, fiends up four in the night

Gave us new style, but some just became too foul
Now it's two-thou', year two-thou'
So I toast to the live that know they broke
Cookin' bag they own work and know they coke

Roll they smoke, the underworld that know they lock
It's the life when you catch strikes and hold no notes
Nothin' to lose for some that's all out for game
Fued in school, show us all out in vein

First chips niggas, get, out comes the chain
That's it, soon his name be, out the game
It's the life, it's like dice, some win, some lose
We pay the price but it's the life that the real ones choose

To the playas and the hustlas, pimps and kings
Rich niggas sittin' on mils with ice in their rings
To the bitches and the real hoes, let's raise a toast
Show love, who could take paper the most

To the playas and the hustlas, pimps and kings
Rich niggas sittin' on mils with ice in their rings
To the bitches and the real hoes, let's raise a toast
Show love, who could take paper the most

To the playas and the hustlas, pimps and kings
Rich niggas sittin' on mils with ice in their rings
To the bitches and the real hoes, let's raise a toast
Show love, who could take paper the most

To the playas and the hustlas, pimps and kings
Rich niggas sittin' on mils with ice in their rings
To the bitches and the real hoes, let's raise a toast
Show love, who could take paper the most

To the playas and the hustlas, pimps and kings
Rich niggas sittin' on mils with ice in their rings
To the bitches and the real hoes, let's raise a toast

Love me in a special way, what more can I say
(Word up)
(Drop the beat right here)
Love me now, love, love me now

Love me in a special way, what more can I say
(Yeah)
Love me now, love, love me now

Since illmatic this shit started that never departed
I flossed retarded for those lost in the projects
I taught them logic gaining courses in college
Chased dollars but to me what's most important is knowledge

Know the ledge for ya'll niggas that so on the edge
It ain't nothin' for an infrared to go in your head
Life in the streets schooled me well, movin' light on my feet
So deep had me jumpin' up at night in my sleep

Hold ya heat if you that nigga that's influencing beef
I'm trying to eat, don't have me put two in ya feet
99 ways I made out to never fade out, never get played out
Got guns, blast ya way out

Love me in a special way, what more can I say
Love me now, love, love me now

Love me in a special way, what more can I say
Love me now, love, love me now

Saw the worst when I was growing
Unknowing my quest until I had reality thrown at my chest
Why would it stress, it seem a nigga zone at his best
Is it a test? At times I feel my soul is possessed

Flavors of guess, throw key at major connects
Crazy respect goin' through it made me a vet
Gettin' down on grounds forbidden
Made bails from [Incomprehensible] to the cells in Clinton, listen

We could war till we no more either or
Or just ball till we all score, it's on ya'll
Did this one for the streets watchin'
And the D's in the streets let them keep clockin'

We clean, got love for the whole game
The gold chains, fake I.D.'s and the code names but no lames
3 OP's and there's more to come, we all as one
Recognize I been this raw since young

Love me in a special way, what more can I say
Love me now, love, love me now

Love me in a special way, what more can I say
Love me now, love, love me now

Was I sent for the sinners that never repent
Or just another thug bent trying to pay for his rent?
Days in contempt, I see how y'all amazed in suspense
Ways spent, catch me at the major events

So blow a herb on ya corner curb my word
Do or die, I was born a swerve, bet that
From 40 bottles to the champagne, twist a pop
White labels to the brand names, kiss on top

And let's toast for the lost souls
And pray enough to hope and meet 'em at the crossroads reunite
Hope I live to see 88 with crazy cake
In a baby shaped burgundy Bentley with Haiti plates

Love me in a special way, what more can I say
Love me now, love, love me now

Love me in a special way, what more can I say
Love me now, love, love me now

Love me in a special way, what more can I say
Love me now, love, love me now
Love me

You got, rich niggas right 
They do what they want to do 
Ha, and you got 
Broke niggas, you heard? 
They do what they gotta do 
Now ask yourself, which one are you 
Ha, fall back 

I had some problems 
And no one could seem to solve them 
But you found the answer 
Told me to take this chance 

Soakin' in Remy 
Sittin' back smokin' a twenty 
Shit is scabby 
The hustlin' is so in me 
Never so envy, got a style on max 
I'm like Po 
Packin' eighty four 
Now smile at that 
Unseen when I'm low 
But still right in your face 
I'm so skinny 
But that semi-autos right in my waist 
From Jags to Jeeps 

With them raggedy seats 
Just imagine how I'm movin' if we had any beats 
Beats relax me 
Good cheeba keeps me nasty 
Lower the smoke when I see the G's creepin' past me 
Duckin' a notch 
Bustin Dutches apart 
Love pussy wit pretty lips 
When you fuck it it fart 
Frina fro
Freak for the rims that glow 
Rock Timbs in the summer or ten below 
Blood in streets 
The signs of the drugs that's deep 
I'm just another nigga next up, tryin to eat 

You Know! 
Not a soul baby! 
It's all for y'all now  

But it seems y'all would rather 
See me hit 
Then see my rich 
Get bagged over some bullshit 
Then see me snitch 
Hopin' some days old bitch will leave me sick 
Like I'm a sucker for love wit some easy dick 
I did dirt through my days 
But hit my worth 
Even then I still made sure no kids got hurt 
Sweepin' next 
Been on since my feet got wet 
From the best turned vet 
Learned to speak direct 

My games jumpin'
We all had out days of barkin'
You could tell niggas styles by they ways of parkin'
While dispute it 
Doe got us so polluted 
Paranoid to the point its like we, over do it 
Police pressure 
Peep how the beasts suppress ya 
Rough up, hand-cuff and treat you lesser 
Toast on me 
Smoke spray your popouree

Not a soul baby!

I got it locked, feel me! 

If in a game 
Get chills on a sniff on my chain 
It's only real, certain niggas mention my name 
Some relate 
Others stay numbin' the face 
Tryin; to keep steps ahead like we runnin' a race 
Nikes and Timbs 
Lady friends lime em slim 
Light make-up 
That shit that blend right wit the skin 
So what the issue?

Finally from every dimension with few restrictions
From up north to the youth detentions, I lay it down
Clear enough for who choose to listen, we all thorough
Infected by cruel intentions, but who the wise
The lies got two disguises, the surprise
Is to know when to utilize it, stay alert
The street talkers say the worst
So overall you gotta watch where you play in the dirt, it's just the rules
A killer could be just as cool, it's no image
Camouflaged right next to the fools, so who's who
It's the game that chooses you
A lot of shit is more easier to say than do, show and prove
Maintainers never blow they cool
Understand, every man should really know these jewels, I'm feeling live
Slim with a gorilla vibe
Away from haters 'cause I know what they feel inside, but never worry

[Chorus]
Blowing cess in the dark (What your day about?)
Playing chess in the park (What your day about?)
Taking trips every week (What your day about?)
Spending chips on them freaks (What your day about?)
Getting money all night (What your day about?)
Betting houses on the dice (What your day about?)
Got your vest and your heat (What your day about?)
Get respect in the street (What your day about?)

Young in the mind with a old spirit
Hot blood with a heart that's so frigid, melodic music
Expressed through slow lyrics
I only spit it for the niggas that hold digits, and don't front
I know about the coke blunts and Remy nights
Got a cousin up in Elmira sending me kites
I'm felt, the ice in my ears don't melt
I could drink a whole bottle for delf and won't belch
Believe it's the same me ducking the D's
Eighty-six with the do-rag, cuff in the Lee's
Appraise this, biological' I'm ageless
Psychologically, I show amazement
Salute, been blessed with the [...?] of a coupe
Hoping the real just respect what I'm trying to produce
Quiet Money is the empire, bigger than rapping
Fuck niggas 'cause I been fired, that's what's that

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
From the streets to the track board
Bubble up, from the crack to the rap laws, visualize
We all uncivilized, the trained behavior
As kids taught to memorize, copy and mimic
I travel through the blocks that's dimmest
Fly nigga, use my teeth to pop the top off a Guinness, never hate
With the hunger of a heavyweight
I stay balanced in the mind when I meditate, and blow trees
Every verse is like a o-z
I know niggas in the 'hood like they know me, so no beefing
It's nothing that could stop me from eating, too in tune
Taught to heal through the doctrines and teaching, redeemed
For women I'm the man of their dreams, stand alone
When I zone nothing coming between, let's get money
The trick is to flip money, double up
Dirty or legit money, it's all the same

To the dough stacks,and nigga start actin' fool
Who's be the loud type and like to flash the jewels
Hit something nice then broadcast the news,

Did it all in the hood, had to leave

Take for fake, got a face that just say for raise
Get in the mix, sittin' up in cinema six,

Lay it down if it's love then I'm outa town wit' 'em
Show 'em some new shit, then give 'em some new dick
Help 'em really confront on who they fucking wit'
Feel a nigga? I'm made for this, remain flawless
I'm like the same song never change chorus
It's real, from the hood, but fortune and still
Lost in the hills, niggas soft in the grill
It's on.

Eight wonder, poker face, aces under
Embrace the mink weather but relate to summer
New wardrobe, chicks wit' they waistes younger
Big coupes kitted up, you can taste the hunger
Hang wit' me, watch how the ladies exchange wit' me
Leavin' the club laughing like them came wit' me
Cop heavy, feel rhythmatic I rock steady
Regardless of the pussy you can have it I'm not petty
It's plain, never meant for the heart but the brain
Depart from the pain, that's the art of the game
Forgive if I ever did, involve your wiz'
That's no reason for niggas, not to father they kids
I'm don, New Guinea born, city calm, with the Russian varn
Looking pretty, all fitted strong, could see it's me
Who else get head in a Vee?, rock red in the Pee?
Spread hash in the streets?

Nothing new, understand this is something we do
Party night, play the dance floor, once in a blue
Me and the crew, prank jewelers, we somethin' to view
Beyond live, we leave all that stuntin' to you
Did the swish shit, and all the mistress
Niggas wives wit' they wrist slit
And still a nigga never did kiss
I'm cold, cris bottles, six bottles
Spit it like and Iceburg novel and chicks follow
Finesse, I move off the love of the sex
And if it's over you can bet my hands is huggin her neck
All the respect never one to try and spoil her rep
But if she stress gotta play the chick more to the left
Money or hoes? can take those from under your nose
Eyes shut like them pros, wit' both of them closed
So niggas what? I'm here to take back, every buck
Every chick, ever fucked, time to stick niggas up

Indeed, one in particular, almost started to name her (ha ha)
I was there when you first pushed up and started to game her
Been a long journey, certain shit just don't concern me
They ain't hurtin' shit; we flip, they hire attorneys
Yo I'ma stay custom, 'til I'm old grey and rustin'
Reminiscin' the number of chickens that claim we fucked 'em
Bet some badda hoes than them other funky rappers chose
I'm tryin' to wife a chick, light a spliff (okay)

Parlaying two red-bones and I'm more patient

Be careful, but promote yo'selves that's what they told me
Involved but unconcerned fuck beef when it dissolve it does not return
I don't leave, stagnate nor move off-beat
So discrete very rarely do I move on feet
I rough-ride twin rugers on the sides of my seats
Drive-by's, bodies left on both sides of the streets
I blacks out never blind by the size of the image
No disguise, homocide don't rely forensic

You could tell somebody raised me with sense
We all need somethin to help us through our daily events
Bear with me; the toughest niggaz tear quickly
No lie - pops still cry and he near fifty - freedom or death

Bought some whips so I relate on how these vultures attack

How can one experience happiness without pain?

And how could I still remain on top of my game?

Seek to defy my radiance, I shift gears to another level
I'm focused, but it's like I'm playin a cold hand of spades
I got a lot of hearts, but these fools tryin to cut me

Vengeance is mine, I plague the whole planet with locusts
I survived the mayhem, my advantage I've been the brokest
I wasn't drugged and inhaled by all the smokers

I've had no one to care (worried all I know... yeah!)

They say wisdom, is the wise words spoken

Who've been lost on a cross, for decades
And centuries, lookin' for the liberty
But receive nothin', but misery
And hard times, and things of that nature
By the devil in a genocide caper
Little Boy Peep, has lost his sheep
But I found 'em, in a deep long sleep
Nine thousand miles away from home
Livin' the life of a modern-day Flintstone
We the people, supposed to be equal
But the men who wrote that, they was evil
Slave owners, who did not include us
They just used us, and abused us
First they trick you, then mentally kill you
And use technologies, to rebuild you
This whole plan was a perfect scam
See that's why they called it, the Six Million Dollar Man
Six is the limitation of the Devil
In the Million square miles of land that he settles
Put you in a three piece suit, give you loot
Chemicals in your head to make you look cute
They use you as a fool to deceive your own people
And fillin' my children head with pins and needles
But I'll take out the pins you inserted
And I'll avenge all my mothers that you murdered
And brutalized, by this modern form of slavery
To speak the truth it takes bravery
And no man could stop my flow
Because I know what I speak and I speak what I know

What, becomes of a broken family?
Dreams are crushed and there's no more family

Yo, as a life can be slowed down 20 frames per second
Seen through Panavision
The inner light inside my mind's shines expands the prism
A man of wisdom, victorious and the glorious
Sight beyond sight we stand up as Divine Warriors
Who smite with the mighty right hand of God
Yield the holy sword, swings the holy rod
Then bathe in the pond of Nirvana, escape the realm of Karma
Allow the true grace of God to shine through my persona
And build the reconstructional terms that's constructive
As we destroy the negative germs that's destructive
Productively, sincerely, we uphold the righteous banner
With the gold touch of Midas, mold the righteous hammer
And anvil, to the sound of Man-drill
Ignite to the speed of light cause time to stand still
Rewrite the script of Egypt, who made the Holy Bible
Or Koran, how long ago, who made the Holy Title?
Of I Self Lord And Master, who control the vital
Parts of your heart, who wrote the wise recitals?

But from the door they didn't like that there, I ain't care
As long as I left the china white right there
And understood that you could change a life through prayer
But it's all good, police even politely stared
It was unreal, but still now it feels slightly weird
I was spared, gave love, taught my peers
Though it was rough, never gave up, fought my fears
Now it's like ""what?""
I'm G'ed up, awesome glare
Entertainer from the streets with a sportsman's flair

There, that's good enough for you?
(Dad, Dad, what's ""G'ed up?"")
Listen man, don't worry about that now, just go to sleep
(Okay, okay)
I'll tell you that later on but you know what?
(What, what what?)
I got one more quick story to tell you
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Maybe you could take this story, and tell your friends at school this one:

Here we go!
Out the gate, he who hate himself ain't straight
He a snake, he the type who send himself upstate
Catch a case for a plate
He ain't have to take, he coulda
Played it safe, said his grace and ate
But it's fate, when a person makes certain mistakes
What a waste, how the world",Bedtime Story

It's deep tho, its like my soul was stole by the repo'
Resowed in Carlito, and retold on Tivo
Ice cold wit a ego, dice rolled and somebody's Deebo'd
Trios expose dikes on the D' Low
It's love wit my amigos, other niggas they freeload
Yeah he hold, but my homeys only unload torpedoes
So please yo, I'm from the killa' cap of the kilos

It ain't clear, but I'm right here still and sayin' the same
Refusin' to shed a tear, tho the pain done came
Provin' I played the game, from cocaine to fame
From rope chains, gazelli frames, I remain to blame
It's deep, but never speak certain names in vein
I know beef, and when it peak, it can strain the brain
No police, it's just creep creep, bang for bang
No grief, brothers deceased, others arraigned and hang
None of us just eatin', maintain the strains

Get doe, get low, live life, get nice, rock ice, buy cars, buy bikes
Take trips, live rich, eat good, get dips, stay hood, stack chips that's sick.

Verse 1 Az:

Sex, car clothes money and murda some souljahs to serva
Hood hoppin hopin to murdas of rakim
My own pops got me open on burnas no watchin
Had a heart problem coping with murda that doctrines
No cocrine witnesses niggas whose whaptin
Way when rakim was knockin
Streets was what it was when thugs was thugsing
Gun wars galore going slug for sluggin
Jews, drugs and all niggas love is love
With the crew wall to wall I'll be bugged to bust
So beef war its way to deep to sleep
Niggas keep up coz certified killers creep
Stole his lady, I drove him crazy
You ask me why? coz tha man tried to play me
So be low quickly and you betta hit me
While I'm letting this pretty chick get with me
Steppin with 007 betta make it snapping
No time to do your hair baby, bruvas are busting at me
Blunts and bottles pass but non on target
They want their god hit, but watch how log it
Low as saddam an his pawn so unharmed I'm unarmed no I'm calm I can yawn sing a song
I'm tha don king of dons king kong can bring it on
Word is bomb.

Verse 2: AZ

a course to kid that cut dope an never got nauseous
Cook coke on the comeback and never took losses
The one rap got rich of lifes of this carves
That jigga shit now sick sitting with moses
Dead presidency represents that we are all is one
The call has come to god,streets disciple
Discreet but the beast is like you never off beats stay in heats of the rifle
Sniffle,no releigion no faceless with small incisions
No cases pending though I got dawgs in prisons
Reckless living though restless like the mets in the extra innings
Hope niggas respect my dealings, if not hope not in her
Catch no feelings when you start here with niggas left stressed in billings
Cold killings, old rillings now surf your scene and now your vicinity is in tha mean circulatin sin
Praiser unfold and untold like de la
No souls on strof on summer so stayed high
We conuseuir then rocked the sign of dijoirs so minor my persona was born
No flaws this federal fuckers this cell is tapped
No calls from the double doob in the hell and back
So know yalls coz I can never just sell you raps
This is my life laid on wax

Hand shaking, laughing, and exchanging all they math again
You usually lose touch when you traveling
A few dudes bruise up in the battle in
Parked on Madison, Across from the Radisson
We talked about the tatteling some niggas did in Maryland
Plus discuss, no homicides unraveling
I asked was he dabbling, He laughed and said he managing
His Cardi frames was as clear as a camera lens
He hardly changed, I was near in comparison
We joked about how police choked him out
And he claimed as far as fame I had nough to bust in Oprah's mouth
In other words I was up in clout
And from the curb I need to pull a Larry Bird before I'm up and out
Without a sound sound, snatched my Guinness off the ground
Rose up, gave him a pound I told homie hold it down

It was tuesday when I saw him, figured friday I could call him
Woke up early wednesday morning, flew a chicken from New Orleans
She ain't that average bitch who be doggin' for dick
You know them chicks that get you sick when they keep callin'
Up in Nordstroms for a fresh pair to floss 'em
Of course with footwear I'll be that first nigga to sport 'em
Caught 'em before the salesmen had time to assault 'em
Bought 'em before any celeb stylist ever saw 'em
Wore 'em soon as I copped them in the spot playing possum
Debating my destination lacing, weighing my options
Celly started rockin', I answered ""What's poppin'?""
They answering and said ""They shot him"" now the 'hood got a problem
I had to swallow reaching out for my water bottle
Trying to figure what nigga, why, and by who then
Before you know it the other voice told it
It was homie from the old clique I just seen and just spoke with
Oh shit, this can't be serious. It's my word.

It's ""Dough or Die"" we survive 'till we slain
And it's no surprise homie was probably high when they came
I know the guy he was fly, him and I was the same
A Gemini with a style that symbolizes his name
Godly/Hardley Trained, he can camouflage in any terrain
Cardi frames, we go back like bottles and James
It's a shame 'cause they say his baby mom is to blame
But nonchantly I refrain 'cause it contsantly change
From close range, somebody please slowly explain
If they just wanted some jewels why they ain't got for the chain?
If they just wanted some news they could've left him in his Hanes
But no, they just left a nigga breathless and pain",Never Change

Protect your dome, I'm warning you, what harm I do to the kid

from the start I really want to know what's going on in my heart
Hey, I've got this feeling that you will be mine,
all mine until the end of time
As I go along, I can feel you keep me going strong
Each and every day as I go my way
My love is all for you and it's here to stay
I've been waiting, I've been waiting

Why baby, do you make me feel that way?
I'm glad I got you in my love today
I'll never doubt your love will stay
You love will stay always

I'm hanging on just like a child, said I've been with you (for quite a while)
Please girl, understand me?
Oh my love is not demanding, and I will not ever leave you
Ever leave you (No, No, No, No, No)
Real love with good intentions
Girl won't you share my visions
My visions of a perfect love
Just like the ones from up above
My perfect angel, listen

It's been a long time since I held you near

'Cause I sure miss you

So how do I tell this story
Or someone I love so much
When she lost her feelings for me
Oh how I miss her touch

Have you ever loved someone so much
It hurts like hell
To see the love that she once gave to you
She gives to someone else
Have you ever, ever, ever, ever loved
To find yourself
To see the love that she gave
The love you made
The joys and praise
She saved for someone else

She was a girl called beautiful
And I was so proud of she
How could a girl like her
Be with someone like me
There was a time I had her heart
And oh what a time it was
But I never thought that time
Would take my one true love
So how do I tell this story

Secrets, oh what you kept from me 
They make our world go around 
But secrets, they only last long enough to break you down 

Stuck sitting, you left me there waiting for you 
You didn't want to be my girl 
I saw you by candlelight waiting for two 
Sure wasn't me who was doin' it with you 

Oh but there's too much in my mind right now 
To say how I feel, to do what I need to do 
And how can you leave like this 
When a simple kiss is all you gave me 

CHORUS 

Loving you seems foolish when you do what you do 
But I cannot stand the feeling without you 
I swear girl, I'm leaving, baby, five after two 
'Cause is no way I'm waiting longer for you 

Oh but there's too much in my mind right now 
To say how I feel, to do what I need to do 
And how can I look up to the way 
And see our love fading baby, tell me why

You told me secrets that
You've never told a soul
You were so nervous and
Yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine
As you tasted mine
I kissed your lips
You felt my body slip
Into your soul
I heard you moan
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you
Last night, there was no planning it
It was so special and
So very innocent
We talked of memories
Our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love
And deep into the night
Right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight
In you soul
You felt incredible
I started to explode
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
Last night
I was inside of you

While making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you
Sunlight, red roses
The scent of you, it calms the heart
The sight of you, I fall apart
Moonlight, the things we notice
When we're in love, that's when it comes
And I'm so in love, I'm so in love

Bis Napalm auf dich prasselt, als würdest du gerade duschen
Ich lade, schieß und treff dich und back dich
Pack dich auf den Esstisch und ess dich!

Ihr schießt doch nur in die Luft, extra vorbei
Wir machen's wie die Barbaren, und kommen mit Äxten vorbei
Bald ist dieser Text hier vorbei, aber der Krieg geht weiter
Ich schick euch ABC-Bomben um euer Bewusstsein zu erweitern
Guck, ich fahr über euch wie Ketten von Panzern
Ihr seid nicht nur wack wie am Anfang
Ich schick euch back zu dem Anfang

Ich schlage die Trommeln des Krieges, bis der Stock bricht
Und geb dir auf die Ohren bist du blickst, wer der Bozz ist!
Ich hab dich im Visier, es gibt kein Spekulieren
Ich lade das Panzerrohr und lass dein Scheißlager detonieren
Du willst mich burnen mit deiner Kerze, ich bring Flammenwerfer
Und setz dich in Brand bis dich kein Schwanz mehr erkennt

Ich bin Schütze, meine Schüsse sind präzise
Sieh, dies ist Armageddon, Junge, ich hab Sprengsätze die dich
Hart zerschmettern, Junge, glaub mir!
Es wird nicht lustig, wenn der Spaß einmal begonnen hat
Ich fliege über dein Bataillon, Junge, und lasse meine Bomben ab
Nenn mich Achilles, weil ich alleine die Schlacht schlage
Gegen deine komplette Stadt
Der letzte Samurai im Dschungel des Asphalts

Ich schieb' nur Filme, ich bin als der einzig Echte bekannt
Das A-Z Napalm setzt mit Texten in Brand?

Und lass' euch brenn'
Bin wieder zurück und lass' euch brenn'
Jeden von euch Schmocks, ich lass' euch brenn'
Bin wieder zurück und lass' euch brenn' (Ah, B-O)

Bring' das Feuer wieder back in das Game
Geht auf die Suche, doch ihr werdet keinen Besseren sehen
Ich geh' auf Killmode, kicke und zerschmettere jeden
Dieses Biest lässt hier kein' in 'nem Battle bestehen
Und reißt weg, was sich vor ihn stellt, Rapper sind Fleisch
Im Beatrausch und ich spucke diese Brette ins Mic
Ich lad' nach, schieß' los und ich Barretta den Scheiß
Kick' auf dich ein, bis du kleiner Kek verreckst bei den Lines
Das hier ist flächendeckendes Zerfickungsprogramm
Hab' es versucht, doch nicht geschafft, diesen Pit zu verbannen
Bin nicht zu ficken, so als ständ' ich mit dem Rücken zur Wand
Spuck' Napalm, hinterlass das Game zurück in den Flammen
Und ziele, das ist der Chab, der euch Biatches
Nach all der Zeit immer noch zeigt, wer die Macht ist
Dir Hurenschmock verklickert, dass die Lage wie Fakt ist
Das ist A, nehm das Mic und entfacht es

Mutterficker, lass' euch brenn'
Bin wieder zurück und lass' euch brenn'
Jeden von euch Schmocks, ich lass' euch brenn'
Bin wieder zurück und lass' euch brenn' (ah!",Brenn

Azad,"Guck, dieses Album ist das Größte, was ich je gemacht hab', nach meinem Kind
Muss ich noch mehr sagen? Ich glaub' dir nicht
Dieses Album ist mein Augenlicht, mein Herz, mein Blut
Meine Gedanken, alles, was in mir ruht
Guck, dieses Album ist mein Leben
Ich würd' sterben, wenn es nicht groß und alt wird, hab' mein Herz hergegeben
Dieses Album kostete mich so viel Schmerz
Bei der Geburt dieses Lebens, kam dem Tod nie näher
Und ich hab' mir solche Sorgen gemacht
Dass alles gut ist bei dir, war bis morgens früh wach
Und es scheint, dass du mir mehr bedeutest als ich selbst
Ich gab mein Leben, damit du eins erhältst
Du wurdest aus reiner Liebe geboren
War nie leicht, doch ich tät's genauso wieder von vorn
Du bist mein Leben und das Größte für mich
Mein Baby und ich töte für dich

Kalt, doch jetzt isser wieder back und er fickt euch
Miese Geschösse in euren Kopf hinein
Ich seh' immer noch keinen anderen Boss hier, nein
Wollte in meine Fußstapfen, aber passe nicht rein
Meine Flows sind miese Biester und ich lass' sie frei
Denn, Dicker, A ist der Baba, und immer noch fast die Eins
Und ich hab' keinen Turn auf den billigen Scheiß
Ich will burn, wenn ich spitte am Mic, und alles killen, Chaba
Mein Camp ist für immer die Eins, während ihr weit fern hinter uns seid
Voll süß, aber MC bist zum Tag wo ich sterb'
Bin real, dieser Chab ist nur er, kein Fake-Image
Kein MC kommt gerade vom Herz, bring' dir die echten Gefühle, denn was ich sag', das liebe ich
Kein Beef mit dem Chief, jeder weiß, wann das Biest attackiert, dass ihr Lauchs am Ende seid
Ein Beat und ich schieß' meine Lines, wenn ich fließ', massakrier deinen Sound, verbrennen dein' Scheiß
Schreib' Peace, aber ready for war
Du schreist ""Krieg"", wirst im Battle ermordet, doch kein Ding, Diggah
Wein, denn dieser Rapper ist Bozz
Und einfach zu killer für die Picos, ich bin’s, Diggah
Kaiserrap, ich kille jeden deiner Männer, wenn die Schlacht beginnt
Mach Platz, du Lauch, der Meister rappt
Und ich zerlege die ganzen Penner, die Plastik sind
Hatte immer meine Liebe für das Rap-Ding
Habt ihr im Ernst geglaubt, dass ich weg bin?
Wieder back ist der Mac und er flext einen getaggten Text perfekt rätätätätät, wie ne Gatling

Es gibt kein Entkommen
Das hier ist mein Territorium, Nutte
Das ist Krieg
Der Tag der Abrechnung steht uns bevor
Ihr könnt mich nicht aufhalten
Die Zeit ist um
Und jetzt zerstöre ich

Und ich hab' immer meine Seele gegeben, Herzblut reingesteckt
Und von der Liebe jede Line gerappt
Und immer wieder jeden Rückschlag eingesteckt
Und keinen Moment gedacht, ich würde des hier sein lassen
Dacht', ich würde des für die Meinen machen
Die es nie leicht hatten und immer wieder scheiterten
Aber eiferten, wenn das Glück ihnen entgleitete
Und fighteten, bis' irgendwann mal weitergeht
Und ich dacht', ich mach' das lieber für meine Brüder, die kein' Rap vom Schmock hören wollen
Kein' Rotz hören wollen, lieber Bozz hören wollen
Aus dem Block herkommt und ich mach' des
Für meine Fans, die die Jahre gewartet haben auf diesen einen Man
All die Jahre, die waren, waren nur dieses eine Camp
Und wir schlagen mit harten Bandagen wieder zurück jetzt
Hab' nun meine Waffe geladen
Ein paar Alben vorgeschrieben und paar Sachen getan
Doch Mutterficker, jetzt bahnt des Massaker sich an
Ich ficke all die kleinen Picos und ich fackel nicht lang
Ihr Ratten, kille die Penner und ramme sie mies
Gebe ihnen Banger für Banger, verbrenne wie Piece
Sehe keine Männer, die Lämmer sie betteln für Kies
Doch ich bring' die Wende, beende und ändere dies, Chaba
Hatte die Ketten sehr lang an mir dran, aber
Irgendwann wollte das Biest in mir ausdringen
Ficke die Ratten, sie wollten, dass ich falle aber, aber
Dieser Mann könnte das nie wirklich aufgeben
Dieser Mann schändet MCs via Aufnehmen
Und auf Play, dann auf Tränen, bisschen draufgehen
Ihr Lauchs seht, der Bauss steht wieder auf
Und haut den Bauss-Sound des Grauens raus, bis sie aufgeben

Hört ihr, was ich euch sage?
Du bist fertig!
Du Bastard!
Sie haben es verdient, zu sterben
Ich werde dich vernichten
Das hier ist kein Spiel
Wisst ihr verdammt nochmal, wen ihr vor euch habt?
Wer bin ich? Sag mir, wer ich bin!
Du Arsch, ich bin dein Boss!",Kaiserrap
Azad,"Aha, ouh!
Yeah!

Mein Rap ist noch nicht ganz und ich geb' ihm wieder Leben
So wie er früher mir, bring' das Elixier und die Magie auf DIN A4
Ich seh' die Lage spitzt sich übertrieben zu wie Pyramiden
Hier ist schon die Gegenwehr, die alles wieder regeln wird
Ich geh' ans Mic, bin wie ein Sniper, jede Zeile eine weitere
Rapperleiche, weit und breit nur Einheitsbrei und gleiche Scheiße
Ich war lange leise, doch jetzt bin ich zurück
Bin der King in dem Shit und ich bring' mit mir mit
Das, was ihr so bitter vermisst
Ich vernichte den Mist und mach's hier wieder frisch
Tu's aus Liebe und nicht so wie viele für Bitches, Fame oder ähnliches
Und kaum einer ist real hier, plötzlich ist hier jeder Dealer
Jeder stellt nur viele Tiere in sein Video und macht auf He-Man
Ihr seid nicht stabil, nein, das ist eher fragil
Es ist eh nur gespielt und das seh' ich an vielen
Die hier sind, jeder macht Psis
Es ist B zu dem I zu dem Z zu dem Z zu dem O

Und ich bin hier, um zu bleiben, muss nix mehr beweisen, elf Alben sprechen für sich
Das ist Exzellent-Shit, jedes fresh, wie ich find, technischer King
Dennoch Texte mit Sinn, die berühren und man fühlt
Und die glühen und man spürt, wie viel Mühe und Liebe in diese Führung hier liegt
Denk' an früher und krieg' 'n leichtes Gefühl von Schade, seufz
Viele hatten ihren Stil, heut macht jeder, was grade läuft
Manche haben mich arg enttäuscht, ich dacht', sie waren nice
Doch kenn' die Wahrheit heute und ich mag nicht heucheln, also ist es wie es ist
Und ich nehm' es so, Game is over, weiter geht's
Geh beiseite, ich hab' keine Zeit, ich muss den Scheiß zerlegen
Ihr müsst leise treten, denn der Boss ist zurück
Und er kommt mit dem Shit, der dein' Kopf so zerfickt als wärt ihr auf Rocks oder Trips
Ich bin Lobster, ihr Shrimps, ein Gigant gegen euch
Seid einmal gut, aber dann nur enttäuscht
Ich halt' das Level wie ein Langstreckenläufer gegen euch

Eine Narbe für den Mann, der unter Folter schreit

Viel zu viele Jahre musst' ich meine Tochter entbehren
Und ich trag' eine Narbe für all die Narben, die ich trag'
Viel zu viele Krisen, die schon waren bis zu diesem Tag
Eine Narbe für mein zweigeteiltes Elternhaus
Das tut weh, doch ich weit' es in die Welt hinaus
Trage eine Narbe für diejenigen, die von mir ging'
Jeder von euch lebt noch immer weiter in mir drin
Eine, die ich trage, weil ich sie fast nie gesehen hab'

Muss die Dramen und den Schmerz überstehen
Trotz den Narben, die mein Herz übersäen blicke blind nach vorn

Eine Träne, die ich weine für mein Volk in Leid
Eine Träne, weil in meinem Land die Sonne weint
Eine Träne für jede Narbe, die ich trag'
Würd' sie gern vergessen, doch ich werd' sie tragen bis ins Grab
Eine Träne für jedes Tier, das man quält
Ihre Schreie bleiben stumm, werd' meine Stimme geben
Weine eine Träne für die Brüder, die verloren sind
Und eine für die Mütter, sie werden vor Sorge blind
Eine Träne für die Freunde, die dann keine waren
Und eine für meine Feinde, die ich leiden sah
Ich weine eine Träne für mein' Vater, es ist bitter
Eine für Mo, eine für Artur hinter Gittern
Eine, die ich weine, weil der Schmerz an mein' Fersen klebt
Man kriegt viele Narben, wenn man in den Scherben lebt
Ich weine eine Träne aus Schmerz für Kobanê
Es bebt in mir drinne, wenn ich sowas seh'
Wie kann passieren, was da passiert? Bitte sag es mir
Wie kann ich kein Klagelied singen, wenn sie da krepieren?
So viel Leid, so viel Herzlosigkeit und Kälte
Gott erbarme, wann hat all die Grausamkeit ein Ende?
Eine Träne aus Blut für Kurdistan
Weil die Kapitel unsres Buches alle blutig waren
Weine eine Träne, Pein in meiner Seele
Zerreiße meine Kehle, doch ich schrei' und schreib' vergebens

Ich hab' vor Frauen Respekt und schreib' nicht sexistische Texte
Sohn einer Frauenrechtlerin, erzogen mit diesem Denken
Bin nicht wie ihr
Unterdrückte Minderheit und Außenseiter kenn' ich gut
Und ich hab' Respekt vor jeder Religion, mir ist egal, wie sie heißt
Bin kein Antisemit, ich bin Frieden und mein Name ist frei

Bin nicht so wie ihr, guck, ich trag' Werte in mir
Brauch' kein Geld, um mich zu profilieren, denn ich hab' mehr in mei'm Hirn

Und ich hab' auch nicht 'n Ego, das zu groß, und mich zerfrisst
Und das obwohl ihr nur Vögel seid im Rappen, ich bitte dich, ich bin niemals so wie ihr

Viele Ziele verfehlt, doch es niemals aufgegeben
Trotz den tausend Tränen aus dem Haufen Elend wieder aufzustehen
Und wieder anzufangen von Anfang an und immer mehr zu geben
All die Schmerzen zählen, wie ein ganzer Mann die Fährte gehen
Sich niemals unterkriegen lassen, immer grade bleiben
Nicht vom Pfad zu weichen und zur Tat zu schreiten in den harten Zeiten
All die Fragezeichen einfach mal beiseite und es machen
Wieder hoch von unten und es endlich aus'm Dunkeln schaffen
Auch wenn Wunden klaffen, ist kein Grund zu passen, es muss weiter
Wird 'n mieser Fight sein und nicht einfach, doch es gibt kein Scheitern
Dieser Typ bleibt eisern und er sprüht vor Eifer, keiner hält mich, bleib' beständig

Big Daddy Kane, KRS One, BDP
Ich war infiziert, wollte fortan nur mceen
An neuem Stil feilen, nächtelang am Probieren
Ich fing an es zu studieren
Wie im Wahn, wollte alles kapieren
Ich schloss die Augen um zu analysieren
Und wie ein Alchemist, Formeln in der Kammer kreieren
Und raushauen, sodass alle krepieren
Ich wollt es jedem zeigen
Kool G Rap, Nas, und Big Pun
Wollte mich in ihre Reihen einreihen mit mein' Reimen
Und ich schrieb vom frei sein und teilte dann meine Pein
Ich schlief nie vor drei ein, schrieb weiter an meinen Zeilen
Perfektionist, Fanatiker und Rap-Purist
War endverbissen, gab jedem Text den letzten Schliff
Legte mein Herz und den Schmerz in die Zeilen
Es drehte sich alles nur noch um eins: R-A-P

I'm back
The real
Rap shit, rap shit
I perform lyrical heatwaves
Microphone Master
I can smell the ink

Rap shit, rap shit
When I spit
I spit the truth, rip the mic, rip the booth
No question

Und ich schreibe weiter
Lernte von meinen Meistern, wollt das höchste Level erreichen
Besessen vom Schreiben, das Ziel war das Beste zu zeigen
Den Rest zu zerreißen, ich setzte ein Zeichen
Kam in das Game und drückte ihm sogleich mein' Stempel ins Fleisch, ah
Ging durch die 36 Kammern besessen, sammelte Wissen
Listen I was on a mission, ich wollt' alles zerficken
No competition, rapper wissen ich bin nicht zu dissen
Business demolition bin vernichtend, bring das Licht in Sichtung
Hab den Rap hier auf die Straße gebracht
Ihnen von meiner Heimat erzählt
Und so Kurdistan auf die Karte gepackt
Es hagelte Takte voll mit Reimen
War ihm Wahn, und zwar bei Tag und bei Nacht
Und mit einem Ziel, Top 5 zu sein
Aber nicht in Deutschland, sondern eher im Universum
Verbesserte mich Vers um Vers und vermehrte meine Skills
Mein Schwerpunkt war es Technik mit Tiefe und Sinn zu verbinden
Härteste Härte, deepeste deepness, A bis Z
Ich bin Rap

I'm back

I perform lyrical heatwaves

I spit the truth
I burn the block, no question

Es fing alles an mit AZ und SAV
Ich saß in meinem Treppenhaus
Übte jeden Tag und nahm die Parts auf Kassetten auf
Rappte laut vor mich hin und zog für mich das Beste raus
Ein Rapper braucht seine Zeit bis zum perfekten Sound
Ich checkte auch all die Dinge drumherum
Hättet ihr mich nicht gepusht wär ich noch immer Untergrund
Ich bin Fan schon seit diesem Tag
Sieh ich hab das alles vor Augen
Ich schreibe diesen Part und kann es nicht glauben
Ihr solltet wissen was ein MC macht
Denn ein paar richtig gesetzte Worte verleihen einem MC Macht
Bin ständig wach, und schieße, meine Waffe ist das Wort
Geh da weg, denn jeder Text den ich verfasse ist wie Mord
Und ich lernte bei den Besten
Ich lernte wenn mich irgendwer mit einem Schwert bedroht
Kann ich mich wehren und widersetzen

Wir sind Rap, und das merkst du an den Texten

Sieh, dieses Biest schreitet wieder aus dem Nebel und rein
Ob ich zum Beat kicke? Nein, Dicker, ich trete ihn ein
Ich hör' von vielen Bossen, aber ich kenn' lediglich einen
Komm' mit den Dingern gierig aus den Träumen heraus, Homo
Ich lad' ein paar Lines und ich friere euch Lauchs tot
Fick' nicht nur dich, deine Freunde genauso
Und zwar easy, muss nicht mal zum Äußersten ausholen
Es ist meine Arena, jeder, der sie betritt, stirbt
Du Pico gehst drauf, guck, ich zerberste dein' Shit hier
Der Typ, von dem dein Leben mit 'nem Vers hier zerfickt wird
Ist A-Z-A-D ich werd's dir diktieren
Das ist der Typ, aus dessen Scheiße sie entsprungen sind
Ist immer noch der Typ, der sie mit Zeilen jetzt umbringt
Der Typ zeigt euch, wie ein Großmeister der Kunst klingt
Und ihr seid die Typen, die dann leider gebumst sind

Habgier bei den meisten Menschen
Wenig Empathie, eingeschränktes Denken
Solidar nur auf Profit basiert
Und immense Hassbereitschaft in so viel
Egoismus und Missgunst
Nur geradeaus ist die Richtung
Alles dreht sich nur um Geld im Krieg
Es ist 'ne Lügenstaffelei, auf der das Weltbild liegt

Ich denk', zu viele haben schon aufgegeben
Und der Berg der Probleme da draußen wächst
Und jeder denkt immer, der andre räumt den Haufen weg

Ich seh' die Menschen ihre Kinder töten
Ich seh' die Geier über allen kreisen

Als ein ganzes Leben lang nur als ein Schaf

I’m just departing and need my space and
Time to myself, ventilation
No time for you, I lack the patience

Used to puff Phillies n' Duchies n' Stuff Nicks
Now I light doobies, the cutie from five fifth!
Life like a movie, she typing her own script
What this? young sis, made it from the cement
Started pushing her own bricks
Put on for her city, I pop in Metropolis
Hold this chocolate and focused know this vocal, and chosen
Opponents leave ‘em dead in they own crypt!
Murder she wrote, she prefer it in cursive
The purse sick, the verse is perversive
They worship, making the words skip
Superb witch in demand, she’s perfect
Understand the plan the blueprint
100 grand in the hand its on grip

That's the way that our love can grow
Make the play and then not too slow
Gimme A Chance, I will have to make you dance
Make a play upon the dance floor
I'll be waiting there 'till knock the door

Money getting galore, cream cover the pores
Honey drip on ya jaw, Mami spittin' allure
I'mma get it for sure, getting it all
I'm dreaming it big, 2Pac it Shakur!
Vision it clear, who’s stopping a star?
You deep in the rear while I'm knocking it forward
Impressing the pair, but 3 get ‘em a charm
You checking from where? New Yorker to heart
Harlem girl from the block, ponytail with the part
If you give me a gimme a, I'mma give you a lot
Many Benji’s from Penny's bet you can’t hustle a fox!
Tony, Oscar, or Emmy is you acting or not?
Phony homies and any and who happen to plot?
They come up with empty, while you beam to the top
While you cream of the crop!

You know whot I mean
And the woy she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I sleep with another
When I saw her standing there
Well she looked at me
And I could see that
Before too long I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't kiss with another
When I saw her dancing there
Well my prick went zoom
When I crossed that room
And I shaked her tits with no mercy
(oh) we fucked through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never screw with another
Since I saw her standing there

Your smile carries me away

I'll take you to places never seen before

Life is too short, we can't wasted our time

Two, it was touching me

People's voices seem to drown me out
When I am in two minds.
Who could hide a love so blind?

A one way rush to what I'd seen.
A desert free from threats, mundane,
A tunnel for our love.

Aztec Camera,"Once I was happy in happy extremes
These bitter tokens are worthless to me

So you appear and say how I've grown
Fill me up with faces I've known
In this light, they're far from divine
I save them up and spend them when I have time

The salted taste of all your tears and woes
Sent me in haste, my melancholy rose
Those tasteless lips were closed
You watched me come, you see me go

Once I was happy in happy extremes
Packing my bags for the path of the free
From pillar to post, I am driven, it seems
These bitter tokens are worthless to me

Just like June, the curtains are closed
The ghost of shame, he sits here and sighs
I love the flames like I've loved the cold
I'll learn to love the life of the 'Could I, Could I, Could I'

So I don't cross my fingers any more
You look for rags and found them at your door
How could you ask for more
Than everything you've heard before?

Once I was happy in happy extremes
Packing my bags for the path of the free
From pillar to post, I am driven, it seems

Chill will wake you, high and dry, you'll wonder why

Met in the summer and walked 'til the fall
And breathless we talked, it was tongues
Despite what they'll say, wasn't youth, we hit the truth

Faces of strummer that fell from the wall
But nothing is left where they hung
Sweet and bitter, they're what we found
So drink them down and

Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there
Chill will wake you, high and dry, you'll wonder why
Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there

You burn in the breadline and ribbons and all
So walk to winter, you won't be late, you always wait
This generation, the walk to the wall
But I'm not angry, get your gear, get out of here and

Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there
Chill will wake you, high and dry, you'll wonder why
Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there

Get me back on board, let me be embraced

'Cause even after all those words I want you for my own
Touch me when the sun comes up and tell me that we're home

That we can learn the value of life
Kick the snow with our shoe-heels; shivers give me a smile in the night

I'd kiss you with the lips of the Lord
But to be honest to goodness, I feel I have to wait for the word

I brought you some francs from my travelling chest
You'll spare me the thanks 'til you know I'm the best

We clicked our heels and spat and swore
We'd never let it die

Sold their medals when they saw this train
Now this boy wonders
When he'll feel the fall of honest rain
I came from high land where the hopefuls have to hesitate
Now this boy wonders
Why the words were never worth the wait

I'm waiting, waiting.
In pastel paper pink over grey
We wrap, wrap, wrap and chuck, chuck away
The poor excuse they peddle as their prose.

Dry your tears, tie your tongue and you're never sixteen
And I'll give you a glimpse of the hard and the clean
And my travelling chest will be open to you
And boy will you learn that you haven't a clue

It hit me when I left him
I felt the rain and called it genius,
Called it genius.

Yes I'm searching for the one on a wave

When I could've kicked I snuggled up to think again
But I'm still on the make
When you give I have to take take take
And I'm riding like a buoy on a wave
And I'm learning all my lessons today

Let it cry and let some names be named

When my hands are untied they're entitled to shake""

Pictured me afraid to answer

Then love will show it's root in Cancer

Has drawn me here through graves and gardens

'Neath the shapeless glow?

Or will we swop ourselves like children
For the value of our innocence?

Transformed by some strange alchemy
You stand apart and point to me
Then point to something I can't see

Throwing stones, almost alone except for,

Come and stayed and left and been,
And had still refused to end.

When you throw your thunder and you snap my reins,

I shall seek your holy lunacy, and,
Laugh will joy and laugh with pain,

When he spoke in major sevenths and I'd,
I'd get my gun and blow his tan,
And banish him from heaven.

Could be any place at all,

And I try again to place it,
And it's features are obscured

Like neglect has worn it thin,
And it could rip the sky wide open,
And let the rain come tumbling in.

And we wait on every whisper,
Like it makes us more alive,
There's a sense we didn't have,
And I feel it in the other five.
See the pity and the pride
In the same sea of emotion,
Cup my hands and touch the tide,
And expect to feel the ocean,
It's just a notion.

And the knife has got my number,
And the number that you keep,
And the knife has called division,
And it's drawn when I'm asleep.

A world that wouldn't be satisfied

I said, you only get one hit, that's the beauty of it
What's the good in crying?
It's always been that way at the end of the day
You gotta keep on trying

Life's a one take movie
And I don't care what it means
I'm saving up my tears
For the crying scene

Tears fall and they haunt me
The sad words of the song
It's like necessity wants me
Sometimes, I long just to belong

I dream of demons and money
I see the straights in the rain
I gotta keep on movin'
Before they drag me down again

You only get one hit, that's the beauty of it
What's the good in crying?

",The Crying Scene
Aztec Camera,"I look around me and what do I see?
Sadness surrounds me, alone as can be
With too much time and too much distance

These chains that bind me, they won't set me free
I look behind me and coming for me, yeah
My best friend, she's my resistance

So if you find yourself alone and so unkind
And if you've asked yourself, over and over
And even if your heartbeats hurt like goodbyes
Try, try, try, open your mind
Spend some time with the gentle kind

I was torn between the darkness and the light
Lost to all belief that it could turn out right
But my quiet friend turned me 'round
Made me see again

She took my hand, said nothing much
No lesson learned, just a gentle touch
And I was coming 'round
I am, I am coming 'round again

So if you find yourself alone and so unkind
And if you've asked yourself, over and over
And even if your heartbeats hurt like goodbyes
Try, try, try, open your mind
Spend some time with the gentle kind

'cause in a hard world, with fastness and an eye on the money
I heard a soft voice, saying ""Never worry, hold on honey""
When my world was gone, a whisper kind of eased my mind
And I am holdin' on to the gentle kind

She took my hand, said nothing much
No lesson learned, just a soft touch

So if you find yourself alone and so unkind
And if you've asked yourself, over and over
And even if your heartbeats hurt like goodbyes
Try, try, try, open your mind
Spend some time with the gentle kind

The engine running's all the music I need
I've got a fear of the past
And a hunger to feed

Get outta London and you shall be free
Get outta London and it's guaranteed

I walked the avenue of dumb signs
Meant nothing and it felt fine
Then I remembered what was really mine
A silver shiver running down my spine

Down where the streets are pave with sick schemes
The river's running like a snake through the dream
The politicians gaze across it's slime
I need another way to waste my time

Get outta London, get outta London

I saw the specter of charity
And he didn't seem too brotherly
Popping up what should be blown away
A brotherhood of man in disarray

I got hit by the dreamers disease, where by your big ideas
Don't make connection with your buckling knees
And saw the greed and we agreed that it sucked

Another woman beaten, raped, blood spilled, male hate

Well there's excusin' in what I'm saying
It's just that there's a million colors praying
For real justice that's how it really is

You just get born, keep on keepin' on
Defend yourself against the worries
Try and have fun

Party on until your number's picked
But beware 'cause the fight is fixed

Comin' down with the blues

But when you hold me and really make love to me
I know that love is true forgiveness
Time on my mind is time spent with you
But it's time that I can't find
With the Notting Hill blues

Lovers pass me on the gate
Like distant cousins, removed
Holding hands and it seems like an act of fate
And I'm almost moved

But love has left me standing still
With no directions and no clues
No speech to let my feelings loose
A celebration of the blues

Hold me and really make love to me
And I know that love is true forgiveness
Out on the road I was down with the crew
Now I'm all alone, on the run
With the Notting Hill blues

And it's a lonely, lonely, lonely time
Sadness preys upon my mind
But a telephone and a bottle of booze
But who do you call when your tongue tied up all night

'cause I've been there and these are the notes
From the overground

The world saxophone quartet, the smell of violets
And a passing friend won't let you down
Listen to the rhythm of the rain falling
Say you're gonna change your foolish ways

Make a promise, break a promise in the same day
It goes the same way, anyway
So you pray for silence and its sadness and its violence
To be washed away, one day

I understand the state you've reach of being unreachable
Somewhere out there where only the music plays
Loneliness and being alone don't always mean the same
Who needs the movie? You can see the music anyway

A sketch for winter, a burgundy and sanctuary
Can make me stay when I feel that way
And if my words don't say the things that they were meant to say
And if confusion comes and carries all my words away

And if you still don't understand
I wanna hold your hand, and look at it this way
Someone singing's better than the war they're winning
Winging its way, your way or my way
Any day, any way, stray, stray

Concrete and clay conspire to cage me there
Among the lost boys.

Broken and battered in the thinning air
The birds are scattered and my footsteps there
I long for lost joy.

Eluded me and made me wonder why

Is the hole I hold in me
And all our language and expression
Is decimated by decree
The sound of song dies in the dawn

Steps of the cathedral
Where I kissed you,
Remembered candles lit with meaning
I imposed but that escaped you
With your brown eyes
And your blue jeans
I heard the chiming of the clocks
Kick out the shifting
Shuffling rhythm of your docs
Hit the road with my compadre
Saw the city incomplete
We were tossed and torn and tumbled
In your famous foreign streets
I felt so fearless and forgotten
No-one numbered nothing neat
The son has shone, we still belong,
Brown eyes are gone
So farewell then senorita

I stood inside of something I'd outgrown
A simple sadness in the great unknown
I think again and thank the earth
And kiss the stone

Then the beauty in your eyes
And the stillness of the night
And the beating of your breast
Is gonna put you there again

The single silence of a kiss
Two voices merged and gone amiss
Belief that bends and so beyond that bliss
Finds deeper darkness on relies on this
Then wide awake it wonders why and says resist

Versus a famous face
In the sheen of a cadillac

To where I'm captured and caressed
And life's undressed and left where living belongs
To where I feel it and it heals

Embrace the sky and then it's easy

I see a shooting star
Reach out to touch it and it falls...

Aztec Camera,"Words and music by roddy frame

Now you're back in my arms again
Let your heart be rearranged
While you were sleeping the reaper's been reaping
The times have changed

Speak softly to me
You have more power than the bomb
The tears in your eyes are just medals and prizes
The war is over
Miracles will come and go watch it all work out
But don't give in

If you should climb to the top of the world
Just to take it on the chin
What would would it matter if the world were to shatter
Is it the world you believe in

You crawl to the ends of the earth
As the scenery's caving in
On knees burnt by gravel the season's unravel
Your reason for living

With flesh and blood and small change
We start a little something new
Rather lead and be mistaken than following and fakin'
For the sake of seeming true
All the stars and satellites shine down on you
But which will you heed?

If you should climb to the top of the world
Just to take it on the chin
What would would it matter if the world were to shatter
Is it the world you believe in?

You crawl to the ends of the earth
As the scenery's caving in
On knees burnt by gravel the season's unravel
Your reason for living

If I should drown in the light of your eyes
Well I'd rather die giving
Walk the line with some grace say it wasn't a race
Ain't that a reason for living?

Aztec Two-Step,"STRANGERS
When I was younger, and life a stranger
I dreamed of circuses and things of danger
I watched the clouds suspended like balloons
I sailed my ship on treetop afternoons
No obligations, no sense of time
And life was equal to a lost child's nursery rhyme
And it was easy, so very easy for my mind
Where does it go? Nobody knows
Climbing the spiral stairs that lead nowhere
But as the years ceaselessly were rolling
Like a passage from a play of someone strolling
Through foggy nights and naked imagery
Through sunless days and glass menageries
A frozen face would hide its eyes
And wouldn't dare to even dream about the sky
Now ain't it funny, oh ain't it funny why
When we first met we both were strangers
You took me in from all the danger
You gave me warmth when I was cold
You reached with love and and touched my soul
You put the sun back in the sky
And then you gave me back my eyes
And now it's easy, so very easy I
Feel like I could fly",Strangers

Pick em up, Lord, put em back down
And around, and around, and around, and around.

To be dancin' in the clear moonlight
Otherwise, would everyone be out on
Such a cold and windy night?

Everybody here tonight came to boogie

Then it's time to get it managed
Throw your fist in the air
Let's do some damage
Build it up now you let it all out
Scream inside your head
Now you're ready for the bout
The battle, the fight, the war within yourself
It's easier to forget and put it on the shelf
Therapeutic therapy
Now I'm dealing with my hate
You put that shit up on someone else's plate
Whoever said ""time heals all wounds""
Didn't feel the pain 'cause the pain always looms
Down deep inside your soul
Lost inside your head
Now only time is in control
Now only time is in control

[Chorus]

I've managed to handle and curb my aggression
Live music has become my group session
Every time I perform I learn a new lesson
Don't forget to put your answers in the form of a question
Revolution!
What is the way out of oppression?-3x
Don't forget to put your answer in the form of a question
500 and sick years without your mama
Is the driving force behind all this drama
Xikano neurosis, chickens without heads
Deuce 4-7 like the living dead
No sense of self is how you function
But the sexto sol is under construction
Bringing back all that we lost
And introspection is the only cost
Like tezcatlipoca and the smoking mirror
We invoke the creator of the far and near
La cultura cura, ancient medicine
Ingest your identity let the healing begin

[Chorus] 2X

We must understand how we came to be
How we view the world how we think we see
We came to be via rape and aggression
And hence a psychoanalytical question
Why is their sickness within the family?
And why is there abuse from A to Z?
Domestic violence and child molestation
Are the consequences of a conquered nation
Domestic violence and child molestation
Are the consequences of a conquered nation!",Revolution

El mundo entero para mi se ha vuelto negro 
Se que pronto con la realidad me habré de enfrentar 
Ya estoy negra cuando pienso que podré fracasar 

Ya nunca más tendrá color azul el cielo 
El sol y el mar no brillan todo era negro 
Esta situación absurda ya me llega a aburrir 
Y estoy mas que negra de ver negro mi porvenir 

No se que pasa que lo veo todo negro 
Porque cualquier color se me convierte en negro 
No se que pasa que lo veo todo negro

Ya nunca más tendrá color azul el cielo 
El sol y el mar no brillan todo era negro
