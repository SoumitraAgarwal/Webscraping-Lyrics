Joni Mitchell,"I'm down to a roll of dimes
I'm stalking the slot that's hot
I keep hearing bells all around me
Jingling in the lucky jackpots
They keep you tantalized
They keep you reaching for your wallet
Here in fools' paradise!

I talked to a cat from Des Moines
He said he ran a cleaning plant
That cat was clanking with coin
Well, he must have had a genie in a lamp
'Cause every time, I dropped a dime, I blew it
He kept ringing bells
Nothing to it!

He got three oranges
Three lemons
Three cherries
Three plums
I'm losing my taste for fruit
Watching the dry cleaner do it
Like Midas in a polyester suit
It's all luck!
It's just luck!
You get a little lucky and you make a little money!

I followed him down the strip
He picked out a booth at Circus Circus
Where the cowgirls fill the room
With their big balloons
The Cleaner was pitching with purpose!
He had Dinos and Pooh Bears
And lions, pink and blue there
He couldn't lose there!

Des Moines was stacking the chips
Raking off the tables
Ringing the bandit's bells
This is a story that's a drag to tell
(In some ways)
Since I lost every dime
I laid on the line
But the cleaner from Des Moines
Could put a coin
In the door of a John
And get twenty for one
It's just luck!",The Dry Cleaner from des Moines
Joni Mitchell,"He is three
One's in the middle unmoved
Waiting
To show what he sees
To the other two
To the one attacking--so afraid
And the one that keeps trying to love and trust
And getting himself betrayed
In the plan--oh
The divine plan
God must be a boogie man!

One's so sweet
So overly loving and gentle
He lets people in
To his innermost sacred temple
Blind faith to care
Blind rage to kill
Why'd he let them talk him down
To cheap work and cheap thrills
In the plan, oh
The insulting plan
God must be a boogie man!

Which would it be
Mingus one or two or three
Which one do you think he'd want the world to see
Well, world opinion's not a lot of help
When a man's only trying to find out
How to feel about himself!
In the plan-oh
The cock-eyed plan
God must be a boogie man!",God Must Be a Boogie Man
Joni Mitchell,"When Charlie speaks of Lester
You know someone great has gone
The sweetest swinging music man
Had a Porkie Pig hat on
A bright star
In a dark age
When the bandstands had a thousand ways
Of refusing a black man admission
Black musician
In those days they put him in an
Underdog position
Cellars and chittlins'

When Lester took him a wife
Arm and arm went black and white
And some saw red
And drove them from their hotel bed
Love is never easy
It's short of the hope we have for happiness
Bright and sweet
Love is never easy street!
Now we are black and white
Embracing out in the lunatic New York night
It's very unlikely we'll be driven out of town
Or be hung in a tree
That's unlikely!

Tonight these crowds
Are happy and loud
Children are up dancing in the streets
In the sticky middle of the night
Summer serenade
Of taxi horns and fun arcades
Where right or wrong
Under neon
Every feeling goes on!
For you and me
The sidewalk is a history book
And a circus
Dangerous clowns
Balancing dreadful and wonderful perceptions
They have been handed
Day by day
Generations on down

We came up from the subway
On the music midnight makes
To Charlie's bass and Lester's saxophone
In taxi horns and brakes
Now Charlie's down in Mexico
With the healers
So the sidewalk leads us with music
To two little dancers
Dancing outside a black bar
There's a sign up on the awning
It says ""Pork Pie Hat Bar""
And there's black babies dancing
Tonight!",Goodbye Pork Pie Hat
Joni Mitchell,"I almost closed the door
Cancelled on everything we opened up for
Tonight the shadows had their say
Their sad notions of the way
Things really are
Damn these blues!
They'd turn my heart against you
Since I was fool enough
To find romance
I'm trying to convince myself
This is just a dance!

We move in measures
Through loves' changing faces
Needy and nonchalant
Greedy and gracious
Through petty dismissals
And grand embraces
Like it was only a dance!

We are survivors
Some get broken
Some get mended
Some can't surrender
They're too well defended
Some get lucky
Some are blessed
And some pretend
This is only a dance!

We're dancing fools
You and me
Tonight it's a dance of insecurity
It's my solo
While you're away
Shadows have the saddest thing to say

Love
We can't live without it
Why do we go out and get it
Just to turn around and doubt it
LIke we're scared to care
It's hard to talk about it
Aw--it's only a dance
Tonight the shadows had their say
There's a sucker born a day
I heard them say
Born to lose
Am I a sucker to love you?

You're such a sweet love
You're a proud man
You're a treasure
Time passes gracefully
Living can be such a pleasure
You make it easy to take it in measures
Like it was only a dance!

We're dancing fools
You and me
Tonight it's a dance of insecurity
It's my solo
Blue way
And shadows have the saddest things to say

We are survivors
Some get broken
Some get mended
Some can't surrender
They're too well defended
Some get lucky
Some are blessed
And some pretend
It's only a dance!",Sweet Sucker Dance
Joni Mitchell,"Of the darkness in men's minds
What can you say
That wasn't marked by history
Or the T.V. news today
He gets away with murder
The blizzards come and go
The stab and glare and buckshot
Of the heavy heavy snow
It comes and goes
It comes and goes

His grandpa loved an empire
His sister loved a thief
And lindsey loved the ways of darkness
Beyond belief
Girls in chilly blouses
The blizzards come and go
The stab and glare and buckshot
Of the heavy heavy snow
It comes and goes
It comes and goes

The cops don't seem to care
For derelicts or ladies of the night
They're weeds for yanking out of sight
If you're smart or rich or lucky
Maybe you'll beat the laws of man
But the inner laws of spirit
And the outer laws of nature
No man can
No, no man can

There lives a wolf in Lindsey
That raids and runs
Through the hills of Hollywood
And the downtown slums
He gets away with murder
The blizzards come and go
The stab and glare and buckshot
Of the heavy heavy snow
It comes and goes
It comes and goes",The Wolf That Lives in Lindsey
Joni Mitchell,"Why do fools fall in love?

Joni Mitchell,"You're so square baby
You're so square 
Oh, you don't like greasy diners
You don't like sleazy bands
You just want to go
To a movie show
And sit there holding hands
You're so square
Baby I don't care

You don't like going to parties
To toot and talk all night long
You just want to park
Where it's nice and dark
And kiss me, sweet and strong
You're so square
Baby I don't care

You don't know any dance steps
That are new
But nobody else can love me
Like you do

I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why
I love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
Darlin' I don't care

Oh, I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why
I love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
I don't care

You're so square",(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care
Joni Mitchell,"If there's one rule to this game
Everybody's gonna name

If you're worried or uncertain
If your feelings are hurtin'

Don't alarm 'em
Keep things light
Keep your worries out of sight
And play it cool

If your heart is on the floor
Cause you've just seen your lover
Comin' through the door with a new fool,
Be cool

Smile-keep it light
Be your own best friend tonight
And play it cool
Play it cool
Fifty-fifty

Joni Mitchell,"Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel a power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there
Your voice can take me there, just like a prayer",Chinese Cafe/Unchained Melody
Joni Mitchell,"Well, I've heard of heart breakers
But you take the cake
Ladies' man
You could charm the diamonds
Off a rattlesnake
Ladies' man
Ladies bring it on over
When you give 'em the glance
They don't stand a chance
First, you unfold them
Then you pigeon-hole 'em
Ladies' man

Well it sure takes a lot of
Good natured self-control
Ladies' man
When I'm so hot for you and
You're so cold, so cold
Ladies' man
Why do you keep on trying to
Make a man of me
Couldn't you just love me
Like you love cocaine
Cocaine head games

Cross my heart I swear
I'm not trying to trick you
No tricks
Ladies' man
It's just a straight ahead feeling
I have for you
Nothing slick
Ladies' man
I guess you learn to refuse
What you think you can't handle
You're acting like a vandal
Wrecking the dream
At the first bad scene
Ladies' man
Ladies' man
Ladies' man
Ladies' man",Ladies' Man
Joni Mitchell,"Although I speak in tongues
Of men and angels
I'm just sounding brass
And tinkling cymbals without love-

Love suffers long-
Love is kind!-
Enduring all things-
Love has no evil in mind

If I had the gift of prophecy-
And all the knowledge-
And the faith to move the mountains
Even if I understood all of the mysteries-
If I didn't have love
I'd be nothing

Love-never looks for love-
Love's not puffed up-
Or envious-
Or touchy-
Because it rejoices in the truth
Not in iniquity
Love sees like a child sees

As a child I spoke as a child-
I thought and I understood as a child-
But when I became a woman-
I put away childish things
And began to see through a glass darkly

Where, as a child, I saw it face to face
Now, I only know it in part
Fractions in me
Of faith and hope and love
And of these great three
Love's the greatest beauty
Love
Love
Love",Love
Joni Mitchell,"No demands
Just pleasurable sensations
Hand in hand
No far reaching plans
No, no-hand in hand
Well I keep on trying to understand
Daylight bright
How come I keep moving
From man to man to man?
Giving my sweet love,
Tasting sweet love,
Woman to man

Sometimes it's easy
You drift with the empty gladness
Like it all belongs
Sometimes it's low down sadness
Like it's all gone so wrong
When I saw you standing there
I said to myself
M-m-m here's a place
I could break down and care
I'll give him my sweet love,
Taste his sweet love,
Real sweet love,
Woman to man

I don't like to lie
But I sure can be phony when I get scared
I put my nose up in the air
Stoney, stoney when I get scared
When I saw you standing there
I was scared
I thought
Oh, I hope he can care,
I sure hope I can care,
I hope we can really care,
And share woman to man
Cause I've been moving
Man to man to man to man to man
Oh what am I looking for?
Man to man to man to man
A lot of good guys gone through my door
Man to man to man to man
To man to man to man
Man to man to man to man
Woman to man",Man to Man
Joni Mitchell,"It takes cheerful resignation
Heart and humility
That's all it takes
A cheerful person told me
Nobody's harder on me than me
How could they be
And, nobody's harder on you than you

Betsy's blue
She says ""Tell me something good!""
You know I'd help her out if I only could
Oh, but sometimes the light
Can be so hard to find
At least the moon at the window
The thieves left that behind

People don't know how to love
They taste it and toss it
Turn it off and on
Like a bathtub faucet
Oh sometimes the light
Can be so hard to find
At least the moon at the window
The thieves left that behind

I wish her heart
I know these battles
Deep in the dark
When the spooks of memories rattle
Ghosts of the future
Phantoms of the past
Rattle, rattle, rattle
In the spoon and the glass

Is it possible to learn
How to care and yet not care
Since love has two faces
Hope and despair
And pleasure always turns to fear
I find
At least the moon at the window
The thieves left that behind
At least they left the moon
Behind the blind
Moon at the window",Moon at the Window
Joni Mitchell,"We got a break
Unbelievable

Joni Mitchell,"Yes I do, I love you!
I swear on the stars above I do!
I swear on the streetlight on the corner
Shoving back the shadows!
One shadow cursing
Another shadow laughing
Underneath the streetlight
I don't know where they're coming from
I just see 'em passing
Underneath the streetlight 

Yes I do, I love you!
I swear on the buildings above I do!
I swear on a billion yellow and T.V. blue windows!
Gayboys with their pants so tight
Out in the neon light
Underneath the street light

Kicking over garbage cans
Underneath the streetlight

Yes I do, I love you!
I swear on the blinkin' planes above I do!
I swear on the truck at the stoplight
With his airbrakes moaning!
All night the trucks roll
Up to the tunnel-toll
Underneath the streetlight
They come rollin', rollin'
Rollin' for a living
Underneath the streetlight

Yes I do, I love you!
I swear on the disco sparkle dark I do!
I swear on the be-bop boys
Chasing the black bird
Rock 'n' roll broadcast
Movin' up now full blast

Joni Mitchell,"He came
She smiled
She thought she had him tamed
But he was just as wild
Eating from her hand at last
Wild things run fast

In the dark
He could see
The trap that was lying in her
Sweet company
Eating from her hand at last
Wild things run fast

Winter beat the pines about
He heard the heater
Cutting in and out
While she dreamed away

In the night
It snowed
Fast tracks in the powder white
Leading out to the road
Winding from her tender grasp
Wild things run fast
Wild things run fast
Wild things run fast

What makes you run?
Wild thing
I thought you loved me",Wild Things Run Fast
Joni Mitchell,"It came to pass
Like lightening striking from above
Electric flash
Just like lightening striking from above
Struck by precious love
Precious, precious love
So hopeless and so inspired
Why do you dream flat tires
When you dream flat tires?
You dream flat tires

With a jack and a spare you're there
Trying to get to where love is
Coming in on a wing and a prayer
Trying to get to where love is
'Cause love is precious love
You said it was precious
When first you felt my fire
Before you dreamed flat tires
You dreamed flat tires
You dream flat tires

""Woman she bounce back easy
But a man could break both his legs""
Are you telling me that to tease me?
Or just to hear me beg
""Please don't go!""

Cause I know that you love me
But, when are you going to let love be
Just a vague flirtation
Or extra special company?
'Cause love is precious love
Everybody knows it's precious
When first they feel that fire
Before they dream flat tires
They dream flat tires
They dream flat tires

""Woman she bounce back easy
But a man could break both his legs""
Do you tell me that to tease me
Or just to hear me beg
""Please don't be cold""

I know that you love me
But, what are you going to let love do?

Joni Mitchell,"No tongue in the bell
And the fishwives yell
But they might as well be mute
So you get to keep the pictures
That don't seem like much
Cold white keys under your fingers
Now you're thinking
""That's no substitute
It just don't do it
Like the song of a warm, warm body
Loving your touch""

In the court they carve your legend
With an apple in its jaw
And the women that you wanted
They get their laughs
Long silk stockings
On the bedposts of refinement
You're too raw
They think you're too raw
It's the judgment of the moon and stars
Your solitary path
Draw yourself a bath
Think what you'd like to have
For supper
Or take a walk
A park
A bridge
A tree
A river
Revoked but not yet canceled
The gift goes on
In silence
In a bell jar
Still a song

You've got to shake your fists at lightning now
You've got to roar like forest fire
You've got to spread your light like blazes
All across the sky
They're going to aim the hoses on you
Show 'em you won't expire
Not till you burn up every passion
Not even when you die
Come on now
You've got to try
If you're feeling contempt
Well then you tell it
If you're tired of the silent night
Jesus, well then you yell it
Condemned to wires and hammers
Strike every chord that you feel
That broken trees
And elephant ivories
Conceal",Judgement of the Moon and Stars (Ludwig's Tune)
Joni Mitchell,"Dog eat dog
It's dog eat dog, I'm just waking up
The dove is in the dungeon
And the white-washed hawks pedal hate and call it love
Dog eat dog
Holy hope in the hands of
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers
And big wig financiers

Dog eat dog
On prime time crime the victim begs
Money is the road to justice
And power walks it on crooked legs
Prime, time, crime
Holy hope in the hands of
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers
And big wig financiers

Where the wealth's displayed
Thieves and sycophants parade
And where it's made,
The slaves will be taken
Some are treated well
In these games of buy and sell
And some like poor beast
Are burdened down to breaking

Dog eat dog!
It's dog eat dog, ain't it flim flam man
Dog eat dog, you can lie, cheat, skim, scam
Beat'em any way you can
Dog eat dog
You'll do well in this land of
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers
You could get to be
A big wig financier

Land of snap decisions
Land of short attention spans
Nothing is savored
Long enough to really understand
In every culture in decline
The watchful ones among the slaves
Know all that is genuine will be
Scorned and conned and cast away

Joni Mitchell,"Hot winds and hunger cries--Ethiopia
Flies in your babies' eyes--Ethiopia

Your top soil flies away--Ethiopia
We pump ours full of poison spray--Ethiopia

Joni Mitchell,"I have to come and see you
Maybe once or twice a year
I think nothing would suit me better 
(Right now)
Than some downtown atmosphere 
In the dance halls and the galleries
Or betting in the OTB
Synchronized, like magic
Good friends you and me

The sun goes down in Jersey
Rises over Little Italy,
We could talk it up 'til the block gets up
Swapping stories
Sitting around in some all night zoo
Watching it run like a movie
Synchronized, like magic
Good friends you and me

No hearts of gold
No nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel

But now it's cloak and dagger
Walk on eggshells and analyze
Every particle of difference
Gets like mountains in our eyes
You say, ""You're unscrupulous!""
You say, ""You're naive!""
Synchronized--like magic
Good friends you and me

No hearts of gold
No nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel

Sometimes change comes at you
Like a broadside accident
There is chaos to the order
Random things you can't prevent
There could be trouble around the corner
There could be beauty down the street
Synchronized, like magic
Good friends you and me

No hearts of gold
No nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel
No nerves of steel
No hearts of gold
No blame for what we can and can't control

Joni Mitchell,"I picked the morning paper off the floor
It was full of other people's little wars
Wouldn't they like their peace
Don't we get bored
And we call for the three great stimulants
Of the exhausted ones
Artifice, brutality and innocence
Artifice and innocence

No tanks have ever rumbled through these streets
and the drone of planes at night has never frightened me
I keep the hours and the company that I please
And we call for the three great stimulants

Artifice, brutality and innocence
Artifice and innocence

Oh and deep in the night
Our appetites find us
Release us and bind us
Deep in the night
While madmen sit up building bombs
And making laws and bars
They'd like to slam free choice behind us

I saw a little lawyer on the tube
He said, ""It's so easy now, anyone can sue.""
""Let me show you how your petty aggravations can profit you!""

While madmen sit up building bombs
And making laws and bars

Last night I dreamed I saw the planet flicker
Great forests fell like buffalo
Everything got sicker
And to the bitter end
Big business bickered
And they call for the three great stimulants

Joni Mitchell,"I met a young soldier
He said his name was Killer Kyle
He was shakin' all over
Like a night-frightened child
This is his story
It's a tough one for me to sing
Hard as the squawk and the flap
And the beat of, the beat of black wings

""They gave me a gun,"" he said
""They gave me a mission
For the power and the glory, 
Propaganda, piss on 'em
There's a war zone inside me, 
I can feel things exploding, 
I can't even hear the fucking music playing
For the beat of, the beat of black wings.""

He said, ""I never had nothin', 
Nothin' I could believe in
My girl killed our unborn child
Without even grievin'!
I put my hands on her belly
To feel the kid kickin', damn!
She'd been to some clinic
Oh, the beat of black wings.""

""They want you, they need you, 
They train you to kill, 
To be a pin on some map, 
Some vicarious thrill, 
The old hate the young
That's the whole heartless thing
The old pick the wars
We die in 'em
To the beat of, the beat of black wings.""

On the sidewalk with chalk
Just as fast as he draws 'em
Rain come down and wash 'em off

Do you have to go

Without a taste of water
Cool water
Old Dan and I
Our throats slate dry
Our spirits cry out for water
Cool clear water
Keep on movin' Dan
Some devils had a plan
Buried poison in the sand
Don't drink it man
It's in the water
Cool clear water
In my mind I see
A big green tree
And a river flowin' free
Waitin' up ahead
For you and me
Cool clear water

The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star is a pool of water
Cool water
But come the dawn
We carry on
We won't last long without water
Cool clear water
Keep on movin' Dan
We're still in no-man's land
Dry bones and sand
People never planned here for water
Cool clear water
In my mind I see
A big green tree
And a river flowin' free
Waiting up ahead for you and me
Cool clear water

They seem to say
Tonight we pray for water
Cool water
And way up there
If you care
Please show us where
There's good water

Looking at money man,
Diggin' the deadly quotas,
Out of balance,
Out of hand
We want the land!
Lay down the reeking ore!
Don't you hear the shrieking in the trees?
Everywhere you touch the earth, she's sore
Every time you skin her all things weep
Your money mocks us
Restitution, what good can it do?
Kenneled in metered boxes
Red dogs in debt to you

All we can say with one whole heart
Is we won't sell,
No we'll never sell

In the woodlands, footprints of the deer
In the barrooms, poor drunk bastard falls
In the courtrooms, deaf ears, sixty years
You think we're sleeping--but
Quietly like rattlesnakes and stars
We have seen the trampled rainbows
In the smoke of cars

To the missile-heads,
To the power plants

The black coats and the booze, broke Lakota
Courts that circumvent, choke Lakota
Nothing left to lose
Tell me grandfather
You spoke the fur and feather tongues,
Do you hear the whimpering waters
When the tractors come?

I don't go there with anyone--but

In New York City
I'm just getting used to Colorado,
Oh street bravado

Are there pigeons in this park,
Muggers after dark,
In these golden trees,
In the secret place?

I'm going to take you to
My special place
It's a place no amount of hurt and anger
Can deface
I put things back together there
It all falls right in place,
In my special space
My special place

In New York City
That was shot in Colorado,
Girl meets desperado

In bleachers and cafe windows

Looking to have some fun

She says she's leavin' but she don't go

Out of the blue, just passin' through

On two weeks leave, 
Says ""Molly McGee, no one else will do!""
And seals the tea-leaf prophecy.
Oh these nights are strong and soft, 
Private passions and secret storms
Nothin' about him ticks her off
And he looks so cute in his uniform

She plants her garden in the spring
He does the winter shovelling
But summer's just a sneeze
In a long-long-bad-winter cold

""Sleep little darlin'!
This is your happy home
Hiroshima cannot be pardoned!
Don't have kids when you get grown.
Because, this world is shattered
The wise are mourning, 
The fools are joking
Oh, what does it matter?
The wash needs ironing
And the fire needs stoking.""

Joni Mitchell,"Cherokee Louise is hiding in this tunnel
In the Broadway bridge
We're crawling on our knees
We've got flashlights and batteries
We've got cold cuts from the fridge

Last year about this time
We used to climb up in the branches
Just to sway there in some breeze
Now the cops on the street
They want Cherokee Louise

People like to talk
Tongues are waggin' over fences
Waggin' over phones
All their doors are locked
God she can't even come to our house
But I know where she'll go

To the place where you can stand
And press your hands like it was bubble bath
In dust piled high as me
Down under the street
My friend
Poor Cherokee Louise

Ever since we turned 13
It's like a minefield
Walking to the door
Going out you get the 3rd degree
And comin' in you get the 3rd world war

We put our pennies on the rails
And when the train went by
We were jumpin' round like fools
Goin' ""Look no heads or tails""
Goin' ""Look my lucky prize""

He opens up a zipper
And he yanks her to her knees
Oh please be here-please

Joni Mitchell,"Once in a while
In a big blue moon
There comes a night like this
Like some surrealist
Invented this fourth of July
Night ride home

Hula girls
And caterpillar tractors in the sand
The ukulele man
The fireworks
This 4th of July
Night ride home

I love the man beside me
We love the open road
No phones till Friday
Far from the overkill
Far from the overload

Back at the bar
The band tears down
But out here in the headlight beams
The silver power lines
Gleam
On this fourth of July
Night ride home

Round the curve
And a big dark horse
Red taillights on his hide
Is keeping right alongside
Rev for stride

Joni Mitchell,"I want to paint a picture
Botticelli style
Instead of Venus on a clam
I'd paint this flower child
""You are the air my flowers breathe""
He calls, and the ladies turn around
On the first day of Spring
I'm looking at the only joy around

He's the only joy around
The only joy I found
The only joy in town

The Spanish steps are crowded
Bunch of bodies brooding there
Dead pan side-walk vendors
Hustling vacant stares
Making all the more exceptional
This fool in a flower crown
On the first day of Spring
I'm looking at the only joy in town

He's the only joy around
The only joy I found
The only joy in town

The Botticelli black boy
With the fuchsias in his hair
Is breathing in women like oxygen
On the Spanish stairs
In my youth I would have followed him
All through this Terra-Cotta town
On the first day of Spring
We'd dance and sing
And be the only joy around

We'd be the only joy around
The only joy in town
He's the only joy I've found
All day

At night these streets are empty
Where does everybody go
Where are the brash and tender rooms
In Roman candle glow
Where are Fellini's circus'
La Dolce Vita clowns
On the first day of Spring
I'm looking
At the only joy in town

He's the only joy around
The only joy I found

Joni Mitchell,"Turning and turning
Within the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer
Things fall apart
The center cannot hold
And a blood dimmed tide
Is loosed upon the world

Nothing is sacred
The ceremony sinks
Innocence is drowned
In anarchy
The best lack conviction
Given some time to think
And the worst are full of passion
Without mercy

Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming
And the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast
Its hour come at last
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born

Hoping and hoping
As if by my weak faith
The spirit of this world
Would heal and rise
Vast are the shadows
That straddle and strafe
And struggle in the darkness
Troubling my eyes

Shaped like a lion
It has the head of a man
With a gaze as blank
And pitiless as the sun
And it's moving its slow thighs
Across the desert sands
Through dark indignant
Reeling falcons

Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming
And the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast
Its hour come at last
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born

Raging and raging
It rises from the deep
Opening its eyes
After twenty centuries
Vexed to a nightmare
Out of a stony sleep
By a rocking cradle
By the Sea of Galilee

Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming
And the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast
Its hour come at last

Joni Mitchell,"Tomorrow is Sunday
Now there's only one day left to go
Till you walk by
Below my window
The weekends drive me mad
Holidays are oh too sad
'Cause you don't go
Below my window

No one knows I'm here
One day I just disappeared
And I took these two grey rooms up here
With a view
When you walk by
Below my window

You look so youthful
Time has been untruthful
Heaven knows I loved you
30 years ago
Hot days your shirt's undone
Rainy days you run
Oh and then you fade so fast
Below my window

No one knows I'm here
One day I just disappeared

Joni Mitchell,"Because Elvis gave 'em cars
You think I'm cheap
And you're hard done by
Look-you live here like a star
Rent free suite
Big blue pool that you sun by
Trips to tropic shores
Clothes from fancy stores
You want too much
You want too badly
You want everything for nothing

Going to the church
You chant
For my downfall
Chanting for my house
My friends
You want it all
The pillows on my bed
The visions in my head
You want too much
You want too badly
You want everything for nothing

In the land of litigation
The courts are like game shows
Take what's behind the curtain
The jury cries
I'm not going to be the jackpot
At the end of your perjured rainbow
Not if local justice has even one good eye

Oh it's not like I was blind
I saw
But I took no action
As you began to climb
Green clawed
Dissatisfaction
It wasn't hard to guess
That the end would be a mess
You want too much
You want too badly
You want everything for nothing

In the land of mass frustration
The judges are sleeping
Counting wooly little lawyers
And grinding their teeth
Outside my sleepless window
The Hollywood sirens are shrieking
While down some search lit alley runs
Some lost belief

Oh I'm tangled in your lies
Your scam
Your spider web
Spit spun between the trees
Doors slam
You want my head
You'd eat your young alive
For a jaguar in the drive
You lie too much
You lie too badly
You want everything for nothing",The Windfall (Everything for Nothing)
Joni Mitchell,"Everybody looks so ill at ease
So distrustful, so displeased
Running down the table
I see a borderline
Like a barbed wire fence
Strung tight, strung tense
Prickling with pretense
A borderline

Why are you smirking at your friend?
Is this to be the night
When all well-wishing ends?
All credibility revoked?
Thin skin, thick jokes
Can we blame it on the smoke
This borderline?

Every bristling shaft of pride
Church or nation
Team or tribe
Every notion we subscribe to
Is just a borderline
Good or bad, we think we know
As if thinking makes things so
All convictions grow along a borderline

Smug in your jaded expertise
You scathe the wonder world
And you praise barbarity
In this illusionary place
This scared, hard-edged rat race
All liberty is laced with
Borderlines

Every income, every age
Every fashion-plated rage
Every measure, every gauge
Creates a borderline
Every stone thrown through glass
Every mean-streets kickass
Every swan caught on the grass
Will draw a borderline

You snipe so steady
You snub so snide
So ripe and ready
To diminish and deride
You're so quick to condescend
My opinionated friend
All you deface, all you defend
Is just a borderline
Just a borderline
Another borderline
Just a borderline",Borderline
Joni Mitchell,"Last chance lost
In the tyranny of a long good-bye
Last chance lost
We talk of us with deadly earnest eyes
Last chance lost
We talk of love in terms of sacrifice and compromise
Last chance

The hero cannot make the change
Last chance lost
The shrew will not be tamed
Last chance lost
They bicker on the rifle range
Blame takes aim

Joni Mitchell,"I was an unmarried girl
I'd just turned twenty-seven
When they sent me to the sisters
For the way men looked at me
Branded as a Jezebel
I knew I was not bound for Heaven
I'd be cast in shame
Into the Magdalene laundries

Most girls come here pregnant
Some by their own fathers
Bridget got that belly by her parish priest
We're trying to get things white as snow
All of us woe-begotten-daughters
In the streaming stains
Of the Magdalene laundries

Prostitutes and destitutes
And temptresses like me
Fallen women
Sentenced into dreamless drudgery
Why do they call this heartless place
Our Lady of Charity?
Oh charity!

These bloodless brides of Jesus
If they had just once glimpsed their groom
Then they'd know, and they'd drop the stones
Concealed behind their rosaries
They wilt the grass they walk upon
They leech the light out of a room
They'd like to drive us down the drain
At the Magdalene laundries

Peg O'Connell died today
She was a cheeky girl
A flirt
They just stuffed her in a hole!
Surely to God you'd think at least some bells should ring!
One day I'm going to die here too
And they'll plant me in the dirt
Like some lame bulb
That never blooms, come any spring
Not any spring",The Magdalene Laundries
Joni Mitchell,"The story hit the news
From coast to coast
They said you beat the girl
You loved the most
Your charitable acts
Seemed out of place
With the beauty
With your fist marks on her face
Your buddies all stood by
They bet their
Fortunes and their fame
That she was out of line
And you were not to blame

Six hundred thousand doctors
Are putting on rubber gloves
And they're poking
At the miseries made of love
They say they're learning
How to spot
The battered wives
Among all the women
They see bleeding through their lives
I bleed
For your perversity
These red words that make a stain
On your white-washed claim that
She was out of line
And you were not to blame

I heard your baby say
When he was only three
""Daddy, let's get some girls
One for you and one for me""
His mother had the frailty
You despise
And the looks you love
To drive to suicide
Not one wet eye around her
Lonely little grave
Said ""He was out of line, girl
You were not to blame""",Not to Blame
Joni Mitchell,"I pulled up behind a Cadillac
We were waiting for the light
And I took a look at his license plate
It said, ""Just Ice""
Is justice just ice?
Governed by greed and lust?
Just the strong doing what they can
And the weak suffering what they must?
Oh, and the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills

Doctors' pills give you brand new ills
And the bills bury you like an avalanche
And lawyers haven't been this popular
Since Robespierre slaughtered half of France!
And Indian chiefs with their old beliefs know
The balance is undone, crazy ions
You can feel it out in traffic
Everyone hates everyone
And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills

All these jack-offs at the office
The rapist in the pool
Oh, and the tragedies in the nurseries
Little kids packin' guns to school
The ulcerated ozone
These tumors of the skin
This hostile sun beating down on
Massive mess we're in
And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
And sex kills
Sex kills
Sex kills
Oh, sex kills
Sex kills",Sex Kills
Joni Mitchell,"Let me speak
Let me spit out my bitterness
Born of grief and nights without sleep
And festering flesh
Do you have eyes?
Can you see like mankind sees?
Why have you soured and curdled me?
Oh, you tireless watcher
What have I done to you?
That you make everything I dread and everything I fear
Come true

Once I was blessed
I was awaited like the rain
Like eyes for the blind
Like feet for the lame
Kings heard my words
And they sought out my company
But now the janitors of Shadowland
Flick their brooms at me
Oh, you tireless watcher
What have I done to you?
That you make everything I dread and everything I fear
Come true? (Man is the sire of sorrow)

I've lost all taste for life
I'm all complaints
Tell me why do you starve the faithful?
Why do you crucify the saints?
And you let the wicked prosper
You let their children frisk like deer
And my loves are dead or dying
Or they don't come near
(We don't despise your chastening
God is correcting you)

Oh, and look who comes
To counsel my deep distress
Oh, these pompous physicians
What carelessness!
(Oh all this ranting, all this wind
Filling our ears with trash)
Breathtaking ignorance
Adding insult to injury!
They come blaming and shaming (Evil doer)
And shattering me
(This vain man wishes to seem wise
A man born of asses)
Oh you tireless watcher!
What have I done to you?
That you make everything I dread and everything I fear
Come true?

(We don't despise your chastening)

Already on a bed of sighs and screams
And still you torture me with visions
You give me terrifying dreams!
Better I was carried from the womb straight to the grave
I see the diggers waiting, they're leaning on their spades

(Man is the sire of sorrow
Sure as the sparks ascend)
Where is hope?
While you're wondering what went wrong?
Why give me light and then this dark without a dawn?
(Evil is sweet in your mouth
Hiding under your tongue)
Show your face!
(What a long fall from grace)
Help me understand!
What is the reason for your heavy hand?
(You're stumbling in shadows
You have no name now)
Was it the sins of my youth?
What have I done to you?
That you make everything I dread and everything I fear
Come true?
(Oh your guilt must weigh so greatly)
Everything I dread and everything I fear come true
(Man is the sire of sorrow)
Oh, you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true",The Sire of Sorrow (Job's Sad Song)
Joni Mitchell,"She pulls the shade, it's just another
Sunny Sunday
She dodges the light like Blanche DuBois
Bright colors fade away on such a sunny Sunday
She waits for the night to fall
Then she points a pistol through the door
And she aims at the streetlight
While the freeway hisses
Dogs bark as the gun falls to the floor
The streetlight's still burning
She always misses
But the day she hits
That's the day she'll leave
That one little victory, that's all she needs
She pulls the shade it's just another

Make 'em out of Eskimos
And women if you please

Make 'em nice and neat

Bloodied in the wheat?
Oh what do you know about
Living in Turbulent Indigo?

Brash fields, crude crows
In a scary sky
In a golden frame
Roped off
Tourists guided by
Tourists talking about the madhouse
Talking about the ear
The madman hangs in fancy homes
They wouldn't let him near!
He'd piss in their fireplace!
He'd drag them through Turbulent Indigo

I'm a burning hearth, he said
People see the smoke
But no one comes to warm themselves
Sloughing off a coat
And all my little landscapes
All my yellow afternoons
Stack up around this vacancy
Like dirty cups and spoons
No mercy, sweet Jesus
No mercy from Turbulent Indigo",Turbulent Indigo
Joni Mitchell,"He met her in a French cafe
She slipped in sideways like a cat
Sidelong glances, what a wary little stray
She sticks in his mind like that
Saying, ""Avez-vous une allumette?""
With her lips wrapped around a cigarette
Yvette in English saying,
""Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss""

He's fumbling with her foreign tongue
Reaching for words and drawing blanks
A loudmouth is stricken deaf and dumb
In a bistro on the left bank
""If I were a painter,"" Picasso said
""I'd paint this girl from toe to head""
Yvette in English saying
""Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss""

Burgundy nocturne tips and spills
They trot along nicely in the spreading stain
New chills, new thrills for the old uphill battle
How did he wind up here again?
Walking and talking
Touched and scared
Uninsulated wires left bare
Yvette in English going,
""Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss""

What blew her like a leaf his way?
Up in the air and down to Earth
First she flusters
Then she frays
So quick to question her own worth
Her cigarette burns her fingertips
As it falls like fireworks she curses it
Then sweetly in English she says
""Please have this,
Little bit of instant bliss""

He sees her turn and walk away
Skittering like a cat on stone
Her high heels clicking
What a wary little stray
She leaves him by the Seine alone
With the black water and the amber lights
And the bony bridge between left and right
Yvette in English saying,
""Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss""",Yvette in English
Joni Mitchell,"I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from the schools
I was standing on a noisy corner
Waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet, for free

Now me I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I've got a black limousine
And two gentlemen
Escorting me to the halls
And I play if you have the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the one man band
By the quick lunch stand
He was playing real good, for free

Nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never
Been on their T.V.
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain
As the signal changed

And they charged all the people, a dollar and a half to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone
They paved paradise and they put up a parking lot

They paved paradise
You don't know what you've got till it's gone
They paved paradise
You don't know what you've got

Hey, farmer farmer put away that D.D.T. now
Give me spots on my apples but leave me the birds and the bees
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot

They paved paradise
You don't know what you've got
They paved paradise
You don't know what you've got

Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot

You don't know what you've got
The big yellow taxi
You don't know what you've got
The big yellow taxi took away my old man

You don't know what you've got
The big yellow taxi
You don't know what you've got
The big yellow taxi took away my old man

Joni Mitchell,"Back in 1957
We had to dance a foot apart
And they hawk-eyed us from the sidelines
Holding their rulers without a heart
And so with just a touch of our fingers
I could make our circuitry explode
All we ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

Come in (come in, come in, come in)
Oh, come in from the cold
(We were so young)
Uh come in (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

We really thought we had a purpose
We were so anxious to achieve
We had hope
The world held promise
For a slave to liberty
Freely I slaved away for something better
And I was bought and sold
And all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

(Come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold
(Come in, come in)
(We were so sure)
Who's coming in now (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

I feel your legs under the table
Leaning into mine
I feel renewed
I feel disabled
By these bonfires in my spine
I don't know who the arsonist was
Which incendiary soul
But all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

(Come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in, come in)
(You were too warm)
Please come in (come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

I am not some stone commission
Like a statue in a park
I am flesh and blood and vision
I am howling in the dark
Long blue shadows of the jackals
Are falling on a pay phone by the road
Oh all they ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

(Come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold
(I was so low)
Oh, come in (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

Is this just vulgar electricity
Is this the edifying fire
(It was so pure)
Does your smile's covert complicity
Debase as it admires
(Just a flu with a temperature)
Are you just checking out your mojo
(Oh oh)
Or am I just fighting off growing old
(Just a high fever)
All I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

(Come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold
(It was so pure)
Please come in (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

I know we never will be perfect
Never entirely clear
(When the moon shines)
We get hurt and we just panic
And we strike out
Out of fear
(You were only being kind)
I fear the sentence of this solitude
Two hundred years on hold
(For my loving crime)
Oh and all we ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

(Come in)
Come in (come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in, come in)
(When the moon shines)
Oh come in (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

When I thought life had some meaning
Then I thought I had some choice
(I was running blind)
And I made some value judgments
In a self-important voice
(I was outa line)
But then absurdity came over me
And I longed to lose control
(Into no mind)
Oh all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

(Come in, come in, come in, come in)
Oh, come in from the cold (come in, come in)
(You were so kind)
Please come in (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold
(Come in, come in)
Oh come in, come in
(Come in, come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold
Come in, come in
(I was so low)
Come in, come in (come in, come in, come in, come in)
Coming from the cold",Come in from the Cold
Joni Mitchell,"I awoke today and found the frost perched on the town
It hovered in a frozen sky, then it gobbled summer down
When the sun turns traitor cold
and all trees are shivering in a naked row
I get the urge for going but I never seem to go
I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown

Summertime is falling down and winter is closing in
I had me a man in summertime
He had summer-colored skin
And not another girl in town
My darling's heart could win
But when the leaves fell on the ground
And bully winds came around pushed them face down in the snow
He got the urge for going and I had to let him go
He got the urge for going
When the meadow grass was turning brown

And summertime was falling down and winter was closing in
Now the warriors of winter they gave a cold triumphant shout
And all that stays is dying and all that lives is getting out
See the geese in chevron flight flapping and racing on before the snow
They've got the urge for going and they've got the wings so they can go
They get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown

Summertime is falling down and winter is closing in
I'll ply the fire with kindling and pull the blankets to my chin
I'll lock the vagrant winter out and I'll bolt my wandering in
I'd like to call back summertime and have her stay for just another month or so
But she's got the urge for going so I guess she'll have to go
She get the urge for going when the meadow grass is turning brown
And all her empires are falling down
And winter's closing in
And I get the urge for going when the meadow grass is turning brown
And summertime is falling down",Urge for Going
Joni Mitchell,"Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah! No we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go let me go
Will not let you go let me go (never)
Never let you go let me go
Never let me go ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me

So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me

Joni Mitchell,"Must I forgive you
Each time
And say you don't know what you're doing
There are no victimless crimes

Out here in these graffiti ruins

Oh I am not old
I'm told
But I am not young
Oh and nothing can be done
Don't start

Is a smoking gun

Late last night
I heard you screaming down the mountain
Like you were running red lights

But I am not young
Oh and nothing can be done

Joni Mitchell,"It was a dark and a stormy night
Everyone was at the wing-ding
They weren't the wing-ding type
So they went up on the train bridge 
Where the weather was howling
And oh, oh, my my
When that train comes rolling by
No paper thin walls, no folks above 
No one else can hear 
The crazy cries of love

They were laughing, they were dancing in the rain
They knew their love was a strong one
When they heard the far off whistle of a train
They were hoping it was going to be a long one
'cause oh, oh, my my
When that train comes rolling by
No paper thin walls, no folks above
No one else can hear
The crazy cries of love

In the back booth of an all night cafe
Two dripping raincoats are hanging
Outside in the weather 
The shade on the streetlight is clanging
And they smile ear to ear and eye to eye
Ice cream is melting on a piece of pie
Oh, my my
No one else can hear
The cries of love

Every kiss was sweet and strong
Every touch was totally tandem
As the train come a-rumbling along
They sang a lover's song of wild abandon
And oh, oh, my my

Joni Mitchell,"I went so numb on Christmas day
I couldn't feel my hands or feet
I shouldn't have come
She made me pay
For gleaming with Donald down her street
She put blame on him
And shame on me
She made it all seem so tawdry and cheap
""Oh, let's be nice, Mama, open up your gifts
You know, happiness is the best face lift""

I mean, after all, she introduced us
Oh, but she regrets that now
Shacked up downtown 
Making love without a license
Same old sacred cow
She said, ""Did you come home to disgrace us?""
I said, ""Why is this joy not allowed?
For God's sake, I'm middle-aged, Mama
And time moves swift 
And you know happiness is the best face lift""

Oh, love takes so much courage
Love takes so much shit
He said ""You've seen too many movies, Joni""
She said ""Snap out of it!""
Oh, the cold winds blew at our room with a view
All helpful and hopeful and candlelit
We kissed the angels and the moon eclipsed
You know, Happiness is the best face lift

We pushed the bed up to the window 
To see the Christmas lights
On the east bank across the steaming river
Between the bridges lit up Paris-like
This river has run through both our lives
Between these banks of our continuing delights
Bless us, don't let us lose the drift
You know, Happiness is the best face lift.",Face Lift
Joni Mitchell,"At the far end of the midway
By the double Ferris wheel
There's a band that plays so snakey

With a man as dark as night
You can see him, if you go there

If she knew we were on the inside.

When Emmie Mae ran away
She came back a bottle blond
God! The gossips had a gourmet feast
Chomping on how she was born
But miracle of miracles
'cause we were underage
She got us nearly front row seats
To the right side of the stage
See that tall girl?
That's a man
That one, too

About a month or so later he said
""Why can't you be happy

Some bad dreams even love can't erase

The leaves are electric
They burn on the river bank
Countless heatless flames""
I said ""Send me some pictures then 
And I'll paint pyrotechnic
Explosions of your autumn till we meet again
I miss your touch and your lips so much
I long for our next embrace""

No doubt that's essential
No doubt that's always been a tricky one for me
So, we should just surrender
Let fate and duty shape us 
Let light hearts remake us
Let the worries hush

In the middle of our time on Earth

Won't you tell me how I've gone astray
Please answer me my love

If you're happier without me
I'll try not to care
But if you still think about me
Please listen to my prayer

You must know that I've been true
Won't you say that we can start anew
In my sorrow now I turn to you
Please answer me my love

If you're happier without me
I'll try not to care
But if you still think about me
Please listen to my prayer

You must know that I've been true
Won't you say that we can start anew
In my sorrow now I turn to you
Please answer me my love
Answer me my love","Answer Me, My Love"
Joni Mitchell,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill like I had never known
You smiled, when you smiled at me that was how the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
I found my love at last",At Last
Joni Mitchell,"Rows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
And you leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love, really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

Oh, but now old friends are acting strange
And they shake their heads, they tell me that I've changed
Well something's lost but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all

It's life's illusions that I recall
I really don't know life
I really don't know life at all","Both Sides, Now [Version]"
Joni Mitchell,"Comes a rain storm
Put your rubbers on your feet
Comes a snow storm
You can get a little heat
Comes love
Nothing can be done

Comes a fire
Firemen come and rescue me
Blow a tire
You can patch the inner tube
Comes love
Nothing can be done

Don't try hidin'
'cause it isn't any use
You'll just start slidin'
When your heart turns on the juice

Comes a heat wave
You can hurry to the store
Come a summons
Hide yourself behind a door
Comes love
Nothing can be done

Comes a headache
You can lose it in a day
Comes a toothache
See your dentist right away
Comes love
Nothing can be done

Comes the measles
You can quarantine the room
Comes a mousie
You can chase it with a broom
Comes love
Nothing can be done

That's all brother
If you've ever been in love
That's all brother
And you know just what I'm speakin' of

Comes a nightmare
You can always stay awake
Comes depression
You could get another break
Comes love
Nothing can be done
Nothing can be done",Comes Love
Joni Mitchell,"Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Why should we cling to some old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then you don't worry 'bout me",Don't Worry 'Bout Me
Joni Mitchell,"The sleepless nights
The daily fights
The quick toboggan when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates
The endless waits
The lovely loving and the hateful hates
The conversations with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain
No, no more strain
Now I'm sane
But I'd rather be punch drunk

The flying fur of cat and cur
The fine mismatching of a him and her
I've learned my lesson
But I wish I were in love again

The furtive sigh
The blackened eye
The words I love you 'til the day I die
The self-deception that believes that lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals
It soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heels
I wish I were in love again

No more care
No, no despair
Now I'm all there
But I'd rather be punch drunk

Believe me sir, I much prefer
The classic battle of a him and her
I don't like quiet and I wish I were
In love again
In love again",I Wish I Were in Love Again
Joni Mitchell,"Sometimes I'm happy
Sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
As long as I have the sun in your eyes

Sometimes I love you
Sometimes I hate you
When I hate you
It's because I love you
That's how I am
So what can I do
I'm happy when I'm with you

Sometimes I'm happy
Sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
As long as I have the sun in your eyes

Sometimes I love you
Sometimes I hate you
When I hate you
It's because I love you
That's how I am
So what can I do
I'm happy when I'm with you

I'm happy when I'm with you
I'm happy when I'm with you
I'm happy when I'm with you",Sometimes I'm Happy
Joni Mitchell,"Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all of the time

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor self together
I'm weary all the time
All the time

So weary all of the time
When you went away
The blues stepped up and met me
If he's gone to stay
That old rocking chair's going to get me
Every night I pray
That the lord above will let me
Walk in the sunlight once more

I can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all of the time

Keeps rainin' all of the time",Stormy Weather
Joni Mitchell,"You're my thrill
You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you 'cause you're my thrill
You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
Every time I look at you I can't keep still
Hm
Nothing seems to matter
Hm
Here's my heart on a silver platter
Oh where's my will
Why this strange desire

Flaming higher and higher
Every time I look at you
I can't keep still
You're my thrill",You're My Thrill
Joni Mitchell,"You've changed
The sparkle in your eyes is gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart
You've changed

You've changed
Your kisses now are so blase
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand
You've changed

You've forgotten the words I love you
And the memories that we've shared
You've ignored all the stars up above you
I can't realize that you ever cared
You've changed

You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me, I know we're through
It's all over now
You've changed

You've forgotten the words I love you
And the memories that we've shared
You ignore all the stars up above you
I can't realize that you ever cared
You've changed

You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me, I know we're through
It's all over now
You've changed",You've Changed
Joni Mitchell,"Build your dreams
To the stars above
But when you need someone true to love
Don't go to strangers
Lover come to me

Play with fire
Get your fingers burned
But when there's no place left to turn
Don't go to strangers
Lover come to me

You give the call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart, I know
I've been around
I'm an old hand
I'll understand if you have to go

So make your mark
For your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers
Lover come to me

Don't go to strangers
Lover come to me",Don't Go to Strangers
Joni Mitchell,"No tongue in the bell
And the fishwives yell
But they might as well be mute
So you get to keep the pictures
That don't seem like much
Cold white keys under your fingers
Now you're thinking
""That's no substitute
It just don't do it
Like the song of a warm, warm body
Loving your touch""

In the court they carve your legend
With an apple in its jaw
And the women that you wanted
They get their laughs
Long silk stockings
On the bedposts of refinement
You're too raw
They think you're too raw
It's the judgment of the moon and stars
Your solitary path
Draw yourself a bath
Think what you'd like to have
For supper
Or take a walk
A park
A bridge
A tree
A river
Revoked but not yet canceled
The gift goes on
In silence
In a bell jar
Still a song 

You've got to shake your fists at lightning now
You've got to roar like forest fire
You've got to spread your light like blazes
All across the sky
They're going to aim the hoses on you
Show 'em you won't expire
Not till you burn up every passion
Not even when you die
Come on now
You've got to try
If you're feeling contempt
Well then you tell it
If you're tired of the silent night
Jesus, well then you yell it
Condemned to wires and hammers
Strike every chord that you feel
That broken trees
And elephant ivories
Conceal",Judgement of the Moon and Stars
Joni Mitchell,"You’re so square
Baby, you’re so square

Oh, you don’t like greasy diners
You don’t like sleazy bands
You just want to go to a movie show
And sit there holding hands

You’re so square
Baby I don’t care

You don’t like going to parties
To toot and talk all night long
You just want to park where it’s nice and dark
And kiss me, sweet and strong

You’re so square
Darling I don’t care

You don’t know any dance steps
That are new
But nobody else can love me
The way you do

I don’t know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you baby
I guess it’s just because

You’re so square
Baby I don’t care

Oh, I don’t know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why, I love you baby
I guess it’s just because

You’re so square
I don’t care

You’re so square, you’re so square
You’re so square, you’re so square
You’re so square, you’re so square

Newsreels rattle the Nazi dread--
The able-bodied have shipped away--
Molly McGee gets her tea-leaves read--
You'll be married in a month they say
""These leaves are crazy!
Look at this town--there's no men left!
Just frail old boys and babies
Talking to teacher in the treble clef.""

She plants her garden in the spring
She does the winter shoveling
Tokyo rose on the radio
She says she's leavin' but she don't go

Out of the blue, just passin' through
A young flight sergeant
On two weeks leave--
Says ""Molly McGee, no one else will do!""
And seals the tea-leaf prophecy.
Oh these nights are strong and soft
Private passions and secret storms
Nothin' about him ticks her off
And he looks so cute in his uniform

She plants her garden in the spring
He does the winter shoveling
But summer's just a sneeze
In a long-long-bad-winter cold
She says, ""I'm leavin' here"" but she don't go""

""Sleep little darlin'!
This is your happy home
Hiroshima cannot be pardoned!
Don't have kids when you get grown.
Because, this world is shattered
The wise are mourning--
The fools are joking
Oh, what does it matter?
The wash needs ironing
And the fire needs stoking.""

She plants her garden in the spring
He does the winter shoveling
The three of 'em laughing 'round the radio
She says ""I'm leavin' here"" but she don't go""

They do the winter shoveling

Johnny Carson show

Joni Mitchell,"It fell from midnight skies
It drummed on the galvanized
In the washroom, women tracked the rain
Up to the make up mirror
Liquid soap and grass

And jungle gardenia crash
On pine sol and beer
It's stifling in here
I've got to get some air
I'm going outside to get some air

Back in my hometown
They would have cleared the floor
Just to watch the rain come down
They're such sky oriented people
Geared to changing weather
I'm floating off in time
I'm floating off, I'm floating off in time

When I was three feet tall
And wide eyed open to it all
With their tasseled teams they came
To McGee's general store
All in their beaded leathers

I would tie on colored feathers
And I'd beat the drum like war
I would beat the drum like war
I'd beat the drum, I'd beat the drum like war

But when the church got through
They traded their beads for bottles
Smashed on Railway Avenue
And they cut off their braids
And lost some link with nature
I'm floating into dreams
I'm floating off, I'm floating into my dreams

I dream Paprika plains
Vast and bleak and god forsaken
Paprika plains and a turquoise river snaking

The rain retreats like troops to
Fall on other fields and streets
Meanwhile they're sweet
Talking and name calling
And brawling on the fringes of the floor

I spot you through the smoke
With your eyes on fire
From J and B and coke
As I'm coming through the door
I'm coming back, I'm coming back for more

The band plugs in again you see that mirrored ball
Begin to sputter lights and spin
Dizzy on the dancers
Geared to changing rhythms
No matter what you do
I'm floating back, I'm floating back to you

Joni Mitchell,"It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm going to make a lot of money
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river

Joni Mitchell,"The cats are in the flower bed
A red hawk rides the sky
I guess I should be happy
Just to be alive...
But we have poisoned everything
And oblivious to it all
The cell phone zombies babble
Through the shopping malls
While condors fall from Indian skies
Whales beach and die in sand...
Bad dreams are good
In the great plan.

You cannot be trusted
Do you even know you're lying
It's dangerous to kid yourself
You go deaf and dumb and blind.
You take with such entitlement.
You give bad attitude.
You have no grace
No empathy
No gratitude

You have no sense of consequence
Oh my head is in my hands...
Bad dreams are good
In the great plan.

Before that altering apple
We were one with everything
No sense of self and other
No self-consciousness.
But now we have to grapple
With our man-made world backfiring
Keeping one eye on our brother's deadly selfishness.

And everyone's a victim!
Nobody's hands are clean.
There's so very little left of wild Eden Earth
So near the jaws of our machines.
We live in these electric scabs.
These lesions once were lakes.
No one knows how to shoulder the blame
Or learn from past mistakes...
So who will come to save the day?
Mighty Mouse?
Superman?

Joni Mitchell,"So they paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel
A boutique
And a swinging night spot.
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot.

They took all the trees
Put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged all the people
An arm and a leg just to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot.

Hey farmer
Put away your DDT
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and bees
Please
Don't it always seem to go
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone

And they put up a parking lot.

Late last night
I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi come and took away my old man.

Joni Mitchell,"Hana steps out of a storm
Into a stranger's warm, but
Hard-up kitchen.
She sees what must be done
So she takes off her coat
Rolls up her sleeves
And starts pitchin' in.

Hana has a special knack
For getting people back on the right track
'Cause she knows
They all matter
So she doesn't argue or flatter
She doesn't fight the slights
She takes it on the chin
Like a champ

Hana says when life's a drag
Don't cave in
Don't put up a white flag
Raise up
A white banner
In this manner-
Straighten your back
Dig in your heals
And get a good grip on your grief!

Hana says, ""Don't get me wrong
This is no simple Sunday song
Where God or Jesus comes along
And they save ya.""

You tackle the beast alone
With all its tenacious teeth!

Joni Mitchell,"If you can keep your head
While all about you
People are losing theirs and blaming you
If you can trust yourself
When everybody doubts you
And make allowance for their doubting too.

If you can wait
And not get tired of waiting
And when lied about
Stand tall
Don't deal in lies
And when hated
Don't give in to hating back
Don't need to look so good
Don't need to talk too wise.

If you can dream
And not make dreams your master
If you can think
And not make intellect your game
If you can meet
With triumph and disaster
And treat those two imposters just the same

If you can force your heart
And nerve and sinew
To serve you
After all of them are gone
And so hold on
When there is nothing in you
Nothing but the will
That's telling you to hold on!
Hold on!

If you can bear to hear
The truth you've spoken
Twisted and misconstrued
By some smug fool
Or watch your life's work
Torn apart and broken down
And still stoop to build again
With worn out tools.

If you can draw a crowd
And keep your virtue
Or walk with Kings
And keep the common touch
If neither enemies nor loving friends
Can hurt you
If everybody counts with you
But none too much.

If you can fill the journey
Of a minute
With sixty seconds worth of wonder and delight
Then
The Earth is yours
And Everything that's in it
But more than that
I know
You'll be alright
You'll be alright.

His senses are screaming
Not to be denied...
But if the spell of the night should win
He could lose his bus
For the same sweet sin
That took his church from him
Then how will he survive?

The dawn of man comes slow
Thousands of years
Here we are
Still worshiping
Our own ego

Joni Mitchell,"Sparkle on the ocean
Eagle at the top of a tree
Those crazy crows always making a commotion
This land is home to me.

I was talking to my neighbor
He said, ""When I get to heaven, if it is not like this,
I'll just hop a cloud and I'm coming right back down here
Back to this heavenly bliss.""

You see those lovely hills
They won't be there for long
They're gonna tear 'em down
And sell them to California
Here come the toxic spills
Miners poking all around
When this place looks like a moonscape
Don't say I didn't warn ya...

Money, money, money...
Money makes the trees come down
It makes mountains into molehills
Big money kicks the wide wide world around.

Black bear in the orchard
At night he's in my garbage cans
He's getting so bold but no one wants to shoot him
He's got a right to roam this land.

I feel like Geronimo
I used to be as trusting as Cochise
But the white eyes lies
He's out of whack with nature
And look how far his weapons reach!

Spirit of the water
Give us all the courage and the grace
To make genius of this tragedy unfolding
The genius to save this place.",This Place
Joni Mitchell,"I met a young soldier
He said his name was Killer Kyle
He was shakin' all over
Like a night-frightened child
This is his story
It's a tough one for me to sing
Hard as the squawk and the flap
And the beat of, the beat of black wings

""They gave me a gun,"" he said
""They gave me a mission
For the power and the glory
Propaganda, piss on 'em
There's a war zone inside me
I can feel things exploding
I can't even hear the fucking music playing
For the beat of, the beat of black wings.""

He said, ""I never had nothin'
Nothin' I could believe in
My girl killed our unborn child
Without even grievin'!
I put my hands on her belly
To feel the kid kickin', damn!
She'd been to some clinic
Oh--the beat of black wings.""

""They want you, they need you
They train you to kill
To be a pin on some map
Some vicarious thrill
The old hate the young
That's the whole heartless thing
The old pick the wars
We die in 'em
To the beat of, the beat of black wings.""

There's a man drawing pictures
On the sidewalk with chalk
Just as fast as he draws 'em
Rain come down and wash 'em off
""Keep the drinks comin' girl
'Til I can't feel anything
I'm just a chalk mark in a rainstorm
I'm just the beat of black wings.""",The Beat of Black Wings [DVD]
Joni Mitchell,"And so once again
My dear Johnny my dear friend
And so once again you are fightin' us all
And when I ask you why
You raise your sticks and cry, and I fall
Oh, my friend
How did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum

You say I have turned
Like the enemies you've earned
But I can remember
All the good things you are
And so I ask you please
Can I help you find the peace and the star
Oh, my friend
What time is this
To trade the handshake for the fist

And so once again
Oh, America my friend
And so once again
You are fighting us all
And when we ask you why
You raise your sticks and cry and we fall
Oh, my friend
How did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum

You say we have turned
Like the enemies you've earned
But we can remember
All the good things you are
And so we ask you please
Can we help you find the peace and the star
Oh my friend
We have all come
To fear the beating of your drum",The Fiddle and the Drum [DVD]
Joni Mitchell,"I heard it in the wind last night
It sounded like applause
Did you get a round resounding for you
Way up here
It seems like many dim years ago
Since I heard that face to face
Or seen you face to face
Though tonight I can feel you here
I get these notes
On butterflies and lilac sprays
From girls who just have to tell me
They saw you somewhere

In some office sits a poet
And he trembles as he sings
And he asks some guy
To circulate his soul around
On your mark red ribbon runner
The caressing rev of motors
Finely tuned like fancy women
In thirties evening gowns
Up the charts
Off to the airport-
Your name's in the news
Everything's first class-
The lights go down-
And it's just you up there
Getting them to feel like that

Remember the days when you used to sit
And make up your tunes for love
And pour your simple sorrow
To the soundhole and your knee
And now you're seen
On giant screens
And at parties for the press
And for people who have slices of you
From the company
They toss around your latest golden egg
Speculation-well, who's to know
If the next one in the nest
Will glitter for them so

I guess I seem ungrateful
With my teeth sunk in the hand
That brings me things
I really can't give up just yet
Now I sit up here
The critic!
And they introduce some band
But they seem so much confetti
Looking at them on my TV set
Oh the power and the glory
Just when you're getting a taste for worship
They start bringing out the hammers
And the boards
And the nails

I heard it in the wind last night
It sounded like applause
Chilly now
End of summer
No more shiny hot nights
It was just the arbutus rustling
And the bumping of the logs
And the moon swept down black water
Like an empty spotlight",For the Roses [DVD]
Joni Mitchell,"Holy war
Genocide
Suicide
Hate and cruelty
How can this be holy?
If I had a heart I'd cry.

These ancient tales
The good go to heaven
And the wicked ones burn in hell
Ring the funeral bells!
If I had a heart I'd cry.

There's just too many people now
Too little land
Much too much desire
You feel so feeble now
It's so out of hand
Big bombs and barbed wire
We've set our lovely sky
Our lovely sky
On fire!

There's just too many people now
And too little land
Too much rage and desire
It makes you feel so feeble now
It's so out of hand
Big bombs and barbed wire
Can't you see
Our destiny?
We are making this Earth
Our funeral pyre!

Holy Earth
How can we heal you?
We cover you like a blight
Strange birds of appetite

If I had a heart I'd cry.

Joni Mitchell,"I'm traveling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some cafe
A defector from the petty wars
That shell shocked love away

There's comfort in melancholy
When there's no need to explain
It's just as natural as the weather
In this moody sky today

In our possessive coupling
So much could not be expressed
So now I'm returning to myself
These things that you and I suppressed

I see something of myself in everyone
Just at this moment of the world
As snow gathers like bolts of lace
Waltzing on a ballroom girl

You know it never has been easy
Whether you do or you do not resign
Whether you travel the breadth of extremities
Or stick to some straighter line

Now here's a man and a woman sitting on a rock
They're either going to thaw out or freeze
Listen...strains of Benny Goodman
Coming through' the snow and the pinewood trees

I'm porous with travel fever
But you know I'm so glad to be on my own
Still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger
Can set up trembling in my bones

I know, no one's going to show me everything
We all come and go unknown
Each so deep and superficial
Between the forceps and the stone

Well I looked at the granite markers
Those tribute to finality, to eternity
And then I looked at myself here
Chicken scratching for my immortality

In the church they light the candles
And the wax rolls down like tears
There's the hope and the hopelessness
I've witnessed thirty years

We're only particles of change I know, I know
Orbiting around the sun
But how can I have that point of view
When I'm always bound and tied to someone

White flags of winter chimneys
Waving truce against the moon
In the mirrors of a modern bank
From the window of a hotel room

I'm traveling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some cafe
A defector from the petty wars
Until love sucks me back that way",Hejira [*]

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Jonny Hill,"Ich war seid fast acht Stunden schon auf der Autobahn 
War ganz kurz vor meinem Ziel und hielt mich mächtig ran 
Die Sonne sie stand schon sehr tief als ich zur Ausfahrt kam 
Der Diesel dröhnte neben mir mein Funkgerät war an 
Als daraus die Stimme eines kleinen Jungen kam 
Er sagte nur Kanal 14 ist hier irgendwer? Wenn dann ruf 
Mich doch zurück und sprich mit Teddybär 
Bis zur Stadt war’s nicht mehr weit ich kam ganz gut voran 
Ich nahm das Mikro in die Hand und sagte ganz spontan 
Hey ich rufe Teddybär wo ist der junge Mann? Ich bin auf 
Deiner Welle kannst du mich verstehen? 
Es wurde still auf dem Kanal ich wollt schon weiterdrehen 
Da fragte mich der Junge Fahrer bist du auch noch dran? 
Ich sagte JA und da fing er mir zu erzählen an 
Jeden Tag von früh bis spät schalt ich den Kasten ein 
Sitz im Rollstuhl kann nicht gehen und bin hier ganz allein 
Und meine Mutter arbeitet sie sagt dass muss so sein 
Denn Daddy starb vor einem Jahr auf dieser Autobahn 
Er war ein Fahrer so wie Du bis er dann nicht mehr kam 
Sie sagt mir oft wir schaffen es und tut als wenn nichts wär 
Doch jede Nacht hör ich sie weinen Ich weiß sie hat’s sehr schwer 
Und während er so redete da fiel es mir doch auf 
Kein anderer war zu dieser Zeit auf Kanal 14 drauf 
Er sagte Dieses Funkgerät von Daddy gehört jetzt mir 
Es ist der schönste Zeitvertreib mit einem so wie dir 
Auch Daddy sprach von unterwegs genauso wie jetzt du 
Und eines Tages sagte er mein Junge hör mir zu einmal

Da nehm ich dich mit raus doch leider Wurde nichts mehr raus 
Ich hörte die Enttäuschung die aus diesen Worten Klang 
Ich war längst stehngeblieben das packte mich doch an 
Denn all das ging mir zu Herzen Ich pfiff auf Job und Zeit 
Alle konnten warten nur dieser Junge nicht tut mir leid 
Ich sagte Teddybär wo wohnst du wo liegt deine Station? 
Was ich zu tun hatte dass wusste ich längst schon 
Nur dieser kleine Funker der ahnte nichts davon 
Er gab mir die Adresse sagte lebe wohl und 
Irgendwann vielleicht bist du wieder hier dann wär es schön 
Wenn mich dein Ruf erreicht 
Dann war es Still und ich gab Gas Mit 80 in die Stadt 
Die letzte Kurve ich war da Ich glaubte nicht was ich da sah 
Da standen 18 LKWs Ich war den Tränen nah 
Sie hatten alles mitgehört und fuhrn ihn hin und her 
Ja einer nach dem andren fuhr eine Runde mit Teddybär 
18 mal die Straße runter und 18 mal auch rauf 
Ich war ganz als letzter dran und trug ihn auch wieder hinauf 
Ich hab noch nie ein Kind gesehen dass so restlos glücklich war 
Und seine Augen strahlten es war einfach wunderbar 
Er sagte Fahrer glaube mir dass war eine Schau 
Ich fang dich wieder einmal ein dass weiß ich ganz genau

They learn how to lie to get what they need
And after they got what they needed
It turns into a simple case of greed

The life that I live is my own
All that I know is that I was born
To wander this world all alone, all alone

Some people are born with their lives all laid out
And all their success is assured
Some people work hard all their lives for nothin'
They take it and don't say a word
They don't say a word

Sometimes it's like I don't even exist
Even God has lost track of my soul
Why else would he leave me out here like this
To wander this world all alone

And I'll wander this world, wander this world
Wander this world, wander this world all alone",Wander This World

In hard time Mississippi
Surrounded by four walls
That ain't so pretty

His parents give him
Love and affection
To keep him strong
Movin' in the right direction

Livin' just enough
Just enough for the city

His father works some days
For fourteen hours
And you can bet
He barely makes a dollar

His mother goes to scrub
The floors for many
And you'd best believe
She hardly gets a penny

Livin' just enough
Just enough for the city

His sister's black
But she is sho'nuff pretty
Her skirt is short
But Lord, her legs are sturdy

To walk, to school
She's got to get up early
Her clothes are old
But never are they dirty

Livin' just enough
Just enough for the city

Her brother's smart
He's got more sense than many
His patience's long
But soon he won't have any

To find a job
Is like a haystack needle
'Cause where he lives
They don't use black people

From waking up to laying down

The world became a darkened place
A struggle without end
Although bitter times those were
The days that I had began to understand
I was only a man

I grew up singing songs in church
With questions in my mind
Then turned my back and ran away
From God who gave me life
Then one night his presence fell
I wept and shook and then
I fell down and cried, Dear Jesus, rescue me again
I understand I am only a man

And He said, What will it be now?
Will you choose me or keep swimming up stream now?
I've been inside your head hearing you scream out.
Well here I am, just take my hand and I'll take out 
All of the pain and all of the fear
All of the fear

I'll give you my burdens (I'll give you peace)

Out loud of four walls can't keep him because

I've ever seen
Was a starving face

Instead it's buried
In the ground

I've ever seen
Was a football fan

I've ever known 
Was the soldier boy

Jools Holland,"I heard the stomping of feet dancing 
On the wooden floor upstairs 
I wasn't in the mood for laughing 
So I sat silent in my chair 
There was someone missing I knew 
Outside there fell the rain 
Where had she gone, what could I do 
I played the waiting game 
The cigarette smoke was annoying 
My mood was fit for a bath 
A drink couldn't oil my expression 
Nothing could make me laugh 
I was worried out of my head 
I was in such a state 
What's keeping her, where has she gone 
I played the waiting game 
When you love someone 
You worry when they're late 
When you love someone 
You know the time it takes 
To play the waiting game 
The music got louder and louder 
From the wooden floor upstairs 
I played with a handful of peanuts 
When I saw her standing there 
My mood leapt right out of the bath 
She had got stuck in the rain 
Her coat dripped on a hanger 
Playing the waiting 
I couldn't understand her 
Playing the waiting 
Seemed like I'd wait forever

Do-gooders and reformers lead our nation to defeat
While murderers and terrorists get compassionate release
You're out now, you're back on the street, yeah, back on the street

That's why I remain yours truly, confused N10

I close my eyes and lay back and I think of England
I dream about that green and pleasant land we knew as England
That throne of kings, that sceptred isle set in a silver sea
Has turned into a laughing stock divided without harmony

That's why I remain yours truly, confused N10

The burglars have ransacked all the houses in the street
While Mercs and Posches double park with sheer impunity
When towed away the ponces plead to all and sundry
Referee, what about me?

So forgive my lack of confidence and total low esteem
But the dog eat dog society has deemed us all has-beens
While our smiling bland spin doctors slyly lead us down the track
To a stab in the back

I'm much too terrified to go out at night but the television's boring
They're vandalizing all the cars on the street
But I won't lay down and take defeat

That's why I remain yours truly, confused N10

Thank you, goodnight","Yours Truly, Confused N10"

I can truly speak my mind
It's been working up til this fight
You know I'm not the lying kind

Let your secrets be mine tonight

Trust in your eyes to where they first met with mine
I'd be the person you'd fine

Oooooooh ooooooooh

Can't believe you didn't know it
Can't belive I didn't show it
Can't belive I didn't know it
I can't belive you didn't show it

All my secrets are out tonight

Keep all the treasure you find

I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the endless skies, my love

And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love
That was there at my command, my love

And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy would fill the earth
And last till the end of time, my love
And it will last till the end of time, my love

And I think it's going to rain today

With frozen smiles to chase love away

Tin can at my feet
Think I'll kick it down the street

Bright before me the signs implore me
To help the needy and show them the way

And I think it's going to rain today

""You should write a love poem,
One of those nice 'love is' poems
Because people need their dreams and fantasies""
So I'll tell you what love is
Love is passion and pain 
In the darkness of the night

Screaming spasms of hatred
The line between drawn so close
Standing on the edge, eyes wide awake
Power pounding in your veins
The vision of your face in a shock of light

Love is hard and savage bright
And bleeding knuckles
Where you punched the wall
Agony and jealousy exploding in the dance-hall
The knife blade of tension
Cutting us both ways
It's fighting, fighting, back to back

You and I out-numbered three to one
Laughing and running afterwards
And blood-sweet kisses
Grinding on your broken teeth
Love is my nails in your back 
And grinning in the face
Of a small town's hatred 
Oh, that's what love is, sweetheart

Not pastel pink and wedding white
The same old traps, the half-hearted lies
The cold death
Love is red hot and black hearts
Your whole soul burning
And singing all the while

Jordan Bluth,"From the ""secret garden""

A bit of earth
She wants a little bit of earth
She'll plant some seeds
The seeds will grow
The flowers bloom
But is their bounty
What she needs

How can she chance
To love a little bit of earth
Does she not know
The earth is old
And doesn't care if
One small girl wants things to grow

She needs a friend
She needs a father
Brother, sister
Mother's arms
She needs to laugh
She needs to dance
And learn to work
Her girlish charms

She needs a home
The only thing she really needs
I cannot give
Instead she asks
A bit of earth
To make it live

She should have a pony
Gallop 'cross the moor
She should have a doll's house
With a hundred rooms per floor
Why can't she ask for a treasure
Something that money can buy
That won't die
When I'd give her the world
She asks instead
For some earth

A bit of earth
She wants a little bit of earth
She'll plant some seeds
The seeds will grow
The flowers bloom
Their beauty just the thing she needs

She'll grow to love the tender roses
Lilies fair, the iris tall
And then in fall, her bit of earth
Will freeze and kill them all

A bit of earth, a bit of earth,
A bit of earth, a bit of earth

Baby what can I do just to get through to you
My head is spinning around feelings turning to blue
Baby don't you know it's true

I walk each day down the street where you live
I've waited for the right time, somethin's gotta give
I'd try to say it but the words come out wrong
So listen while I sing you this song

Here is my heart, here is my soul
Take what you want, baby don't ever let go
'Cause every little thing that I do
I do it for the love of, do it for the love of you

Every time that you hurt
You know I'm feelin' it too, baby don't you know it's right
'Cause every day that I live
I dedicate it to you, each and every night

I tried to play it time after time
But the kind of rush you give me
I could never hide
So listen to these words that I say
Won't let you go, no how, no way

Here is my heart, here is my soul
Take what you want, baby don't ever let go

I can't seem to find the strength
To set myself free

Jordan Hill,"I know you thought it best
That we spend a little time apart
But one night without you
Is so much for my heart

I know I promised not to call
Sorry, but I didn't have a choice
I just had to hear your voice

Oh, please don't be mad at me
'Cause I really did the best I could
Not to dial your number
But it didn't do much good

Hung up the phone so many times
'Til I really didn't have a choice
I just had to hear your voice

I had to know that you're okay
I couldn't get to sleep feelin' this way
And I had to hear you say, ""Hello""
I had to because I love you so

I know you thought it best

You've been on my mind
'Cause the last words that I said,
Felt so wrong and so unkind
'Cause you wanted her
And all I wanted was for love
To make us the way we were
What was said and what was done,
Is not the way of love
Just look what we've become

Feel me touch you tenderly
I'm making an apology
Please hold me close tonight
Make it right
Can we try to love once more
And make it like it was before
I need you by my side
Make it right

As you close your eyes
Can you hear me praying how
Can two lovers be so blind
It hurts me once again
Just to know that we were once so close
Won't ya help me understand
Can we forgive, can we compromise
Just believe that we can leave it all behind
It's better left if we feel good inside
One up our hearts and forget foolish pride

It feels so good to have you here again
You're quite a man
To give to me a second chance

I don't know what came over me
I don't know why did I believe
The things my so-called friends
Were telling me

I thought that I was missing out
On a good time
I thought I'd be better off
Living the single life

Now I know, that I never should have let you go
I know now that I was wrong, so wrong, was I
I've come to realize
That I never should have let you go

You are one of a rare breed
'Cause I've never known of a man
So caring, so loving, so understanding
Yes, you are baby

Excuse me if I, if I start crying
I can't believe
That you're still in love with me
I'm undeserving, I'm unworthy
Of such a good feeling

I was a fool not to know
With you is where I belong
I thought I'd be better off
On my own

I know now that I was wrong, so wrong, was I
To ever leave your side
Now I know, that I never should have let you go

I know now that I was wrong, so wrong, was I
I've come to realize
That I never should have let you go

I was wrong, to leave you alone
I was wrong to let you go
I was wrong, to say goodbye, and I apologize
But I was all mixed up in the mind
I couldn't see what was right in front of me, but

Who never lets us down

I know you can't stay
A part of you will never ever go away
Your heart will stay

I'll make a wish for you
And hope it will come true
That life would just be kind
To such a gentle mind
If you lose your way
Think back on yesterday
Remember me this way
Remember me this way

I don't need eyes to see
The love you bring to me
No matter where I go
And I know that you'll be there
Forever more a part of me, you're everywhere

And I'll be right behind your shoulder watching you
I'll be standing by your side and all you do

Let's sit and talk it over
Express to one another
The things we feel
The things we both need to reveal
Let's start communicating
Before it's much too late
And I do believe
It's time that we speak candidly

I'll forgive you for the pain
If you forgive me just the same
Let's kiss and make-up
Before we slip and break up

We can't let it slip away
Our love we've got to save
Before it slips away
We can't let it slip away
Our love we've got to save
Before it slips away
Before it slips away

Sometimes I say things that I
Say just to attack your pride
Though I really don't mean it
I call myself try to get even
Lord knows we belong together
We know we need each other
I believe we can win
If we just try to start all over again

If we listen to our hearts
The way we heard it from the start
I know that when we wake up
We'll find it's time to make-up

We can't let it slip away
Our love we've got to save
Before it slips away
We can't let it slip away
Our love we've got to save
Before it slips away
Before it slips away

If we give up on us
I'm sure that we'll regret it
And if we give up on love
I'm sure in time
We'll come to find
That it's just not worth it
Just not worth it

Don't think that I don't know just where you been
Say you been workin' but all I smell on you is perfume

Don't waste your time

To let me down this way
You got no right
To break my heart again
You got no reason to be leavin'
I ain't gonna ask you to stay
You got no right to treat me this way

You had your chance to keep me by your side
You tried to love me on the slip and slide
Sooner or later your lies are gonna catch up with you, with you

One more way to change my mind

I can't deny I'd do it right
Just let me know and I'll give it to you
Show me where I'll taste you there
Baby you know and I'll give it to you
Your body needs a man like me
Anything goes when I give it to you
Without a doubt I'll turn you out
The feeling is fine giving you everything of mine

I'm the place to be and soon you'll see
I don't care who leads as long as we move

Anyone can make you sweat, but I can keep you wet

Jordan Knight,"I've seen the crystal ball
And I got a lot to mend
I drank a thousand nights
I had a million friends

I watched the world go round
At speeding light and then
Sometimes she walks the hall
I hope it never ends

No other woman get to me the way you do
Baby I would change my ways
If I could be with you
Make me your lover
I'll make your dreams come true
Baby I would change my ways
If I could be with you

Sometimes it takes a light
To see the room you're in
You got it all around
You recognize the sun

I don't want to use the sun
To melt away my blues
I need you to keep me warm
And give me something true

No other woman get to me the way you do
Baby I would change my ways
If I could be with you
Make me your lover
I'll make your dreams come true
Baby I would change my ways
If I could be with you

I've seen the crystal ball
And I got a lot to mend
Do you save a helpless flame
Or rather watch it burn
I need to read from you
'Cause I gotta lot to learn

No other woman get to me the way you do

If I could be with you
Make me your lover

Jordan Knight,"I live my days with the nights that we spent 
All the love we shared 
I put my heart on the side for a while 
Knowing you're not there 
I tried to carry on 
To face the fact you're gone 
But I need you 
So I close my eyes 

[Chorus]
Close my eyes 
And I dream about you 
I close my eyes 
I can almost feel you in my arms again 

Evenings of passion and cries of joy 
Hold your memory tight 
You've been away so long 
I sing so many songs about you 
I just close my eyes 

[Chorus]

No one really sees you watching over me 
And I hope you feel me watching over you 
And when you go to sleep 
I pray the Lord to keep 
You in my dreams 
When I close my eyes

Baby I'm so sick and tired of playing your games 
If you say the word 
I'll be there soon as it's heard

B-section I'll do my best to show you 
That I'm the one to hold you 
Sometimes you make me lose my mind 

[Chorus] 
We can all go to a different party 
Dancing in the streets with some girls from Maui 
We can all rock at the Déja  Vu 
And you know how we do it 
I just want you to start shaking your body 
Times are gonna change 
Girl you know I'm naughty 
I know you know 
I'll go solo 
With so many lovers so many offers 
To be all over you ain't part of me 

You won't believe 
All of the tricks up my sleeve 
Baby you so hypnotize me with your eyes 
I can't control 

Long enough to let you know 
I'm getting old 
Wasting my time waiting on you Change

Jordan Knight,"I feel like the world is on my head 
I don't want to lose what made me a man 
Still when I call your name

I need you to fill me up inside 
Baby you turn me on and on 

Just want to hold you

Don't turn your back on me 
Come out of the dark 
Don't tear us apart 
don't run from my heart 

It took me some time to understand 
What all along I held in my hands 
If you give me one more chance 
I'll prove, I'm true to you 

Now every night it seems so wrong 
I'm here all alone where you belong 
Girl let me turn you on and on 

I'm such a dreamer 
When I'm sleeping, I'm thinking of you 
A million roses, waterfallls, around a bed for two 
Sippin' fruits with the best babe

Need your candlelight, sweet love tonight 
I can't afford to lose you",Don't Run

Since you  had some 
You say I turn you on

It's creepin around in your head 
Me holding you down in my bed 
You don't have to say a word 
I'm convinced you want this

I can't deny  you do it right 
Just let me know and I'll give it to you 
Just show me where, I'll take you there 
Baby you know that I'll give it to you 
Your body needs a man like me 
Anything goes when I give it to you 
You know without a doubt, I'll turn you out 
I'll give it to you 
The feeling is fine, giving you everything of mine 

I'm the place to be 
And soon, you'll see 
I don't care who leads 
As long as we move horizontally 
Anyone can make you sweat 
But I, can keep you wet

I can't wait to give you some 
I'm convinced you need it

Jordan Knight,"Verse 1 

Only last June when her old man ran away 

She couldn't stop crying cause she knew he was gone to stay 

10:35 on a lonely Friday night 

She was standing by the fire and ooh she was looking alright

I asked her if she wanted to dance 

And she said that 

All she wanted was a good man 

And wanted to know 

If I thought I was qualified

And I said baby don't waste your time 

I know what's on your mind 

I may be qualified for a one night stand 

But I could never take the place of your man 



Verse 2 

It hurt me so bad when she told me with tears in her eyes 

He was all she ever had and now she wanted to die 

He left her with a baby and another one on the way 

She couldn't stop crying cause she knew he was gone to stay

Since I can't be kissing you and since I won't be holding you
Will it be alright?

And how can you just say we're though after all this time
I'm standing here with open arms the thought just crossed my mind
Where is your heart tonight?
Your heart tonight?

Feeling a little loneliness and sorrow
I only have myself to blame
Had a good girl and I lost her
I start to cry and feel ashamed

I wanna come and change your mind girl
No more lies and no more games

I never thought of missing you, I never thought I'd need you
Before you left tonight
Since I can't be kissing you and since I won't be holding you
Will it be alright?

And how can you just say we're though after all this time
I'm standing here with open arms the thought just crossed my mind
Where is your heart tonight?

I'll never understand what ever happened to us
What ever happened to us
Our love was like summer the sun always shining above
Ooh yeah, then all the rain came crashing down
And I can't turn this thing around without you

I never thought of missing you, I never thought I'd need you
Before you left tonight
Since I can't be kissing you and since I won't be holding you
Will it be alright?

And how can you just say we're though after all this time
I'm standing here with open arms the thought just crossed my mind
Where is your heart tonight?

",Where Is Your Heart Tonight
Jordan Knight,"I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should've known better than to cheat a friend
Waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time will never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should've known better than to cheat a friend
Waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say

Could have been so good together
We could have make this dance forever
But no one's gonna dance with me
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should've known better than to cheat a friend
Waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Who's gonna pick you up

I think about the past baby 
Why we couldn't make it last, lady 
I know you still have doubts 
But I'm gonna prove that we can work things out 

I wanna be sure that you know what you put me through 
And reveal that you intend to never let me down again

Jordan Lee,"Mary did you know that your baby boy will some day walk on water?
Mary did you know that your baby boy will save our sons and daughters?
Did you know that your baby boy has come to make you new?
This child that you've delivered, will soon deliver you

Mary did you know that your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?
Mary did you know that your baby boy will calm a storm with his hand?
Did you know that your baby boy has walked where angels trod?
And when your kiss your little baby, you have kissed the face of God

Oh Mary did you know 

The blind will see, the deaf will hear, the dead will live again
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak, the praises of the lamb

Always rockin' all your faves

With someone that plays like you
That I would just fall for you
I think you ought to know by now
That's not enough for me
You're wasting your time with me

I'm gonna make you understand
That I'm not impressed with you
Got better things to do
I'm gonna put you in your place
'Cause I think you need to know

That I make my own reality

Or tellin' you what you should do
You gotta find out just for yourself
I only know what's right for me

Should I drink, should I smoke
Should I lie so I can go
To the party down the road

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind, but now, I see 

T'was grace that taught
My heart to fear 
And grace, my fears relieved 
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed 

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come 
'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

Jordan Smith,"In every heart there is a room
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lover's past
Until a new one comes along

I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense
And still I feel I said too much
My silence is my self defense

And every time I've held a rose
It seems I've only felt the thorns
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so will you soon, I suppose

But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break

And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows

So I would choose to be with you

Memories seep from my veins
Let me be empty

I'll find some peace tonight

You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the Angel
May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
Oh, and everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting
Keep on building the lies
That make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Oh, escape one last time
It's easier to believe
In this sweet madness
Oh, this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees

You've got your friends and your places. That's where you feel the safest. Boy don't you see. I'm stanind here in the shadows, learning how to let love go, When it has to be free. You've got your castles in the clouds. You don't need me now.

(CHORUS) 
But if, you should ever fall, think you've lost it all. I will be there for you. And if you should lose your faith, the whole world turns away from you, baby. One thing's still true. (I will be there, 2x on chorus #3). I will be there for you.

(VERSE 2) 
I read the news in the paper, all the fear and the hatred. Baby, who can you trust? But I see the truth through the madness. Here's my love if you'll have it, but if you don't want that much, go as far as you can, as long as you know.

Is there a way I could make you understand?

Do you expect me, to live alone with just me?

I don't know what to say to make it better
Seeing you like this down and hurt so badly when you have been so kept together 
What's this

All this time I thought you didn't need me
Now I've gone from you and now you tell me

You're in love but that's not what it was 
All those times that passed by
With no signs and now you're telling me
You miss me, boy why couldn't I see in my heart don't 
Agree with what you tell me

You were nonchalant, strong and unaffected and you never wanted me to be there
I never saw your heart that's how close you kept it
So right now I'm so unsure how to care

There's a canopy of stars
And I just miss you like crazy
Suddenly the world's too big
And the hours move too slow
And I just wish that you were holding me near

Seven days, it feels like a year
You whisper through the line
You know I miss you like crazy
So baby can you steal a plane
A boat, the fastest train
You know it just don't feel the same when you're gone

'Cause everytime you go away
The sunshine starts to fade
Frozen by the hands of time into a
Permenant Monday
Take me back into your arms
And don't ever let me go
'Cause when I see you walk through that door
I'm not lost anymore
I'm home
I'm home

I won't sleep until you're finally next to me
Can't wait to breathe you in
Don't wanna waste my time dreaming
I just wanna treat your name like a whisper on my skin
And never have to say goodbye again

'Cause everytime you go away
The sunshine starts to fade
Frozen by the hands of time into a
Permenant Monday
Take me back into your arms
And don't ever let me go
'Cause when I see you walk through that door
I'm not lost anymore

'Cause when I feel you right here close to me
Everything is where it's supposed to be, baby

Living in a shell, hiding from myself.

There was a time when I was so afraid.
I thought I'd reached the end,
But baby that was then
I am made of more than my yesterdays.

This is my now, and I am breathing in the moment.
As I look around
I can't believe the love I see.
My fears behind me, gone are the shadows and doubt
That was then, this is my now.

I have to decide,
Was I gonna to play it safe.
Or look somewhere deep in side,
Try to turn the tide,
And find the strength to take that step of faith.

This is my now, and I am breathing in the moment.
As I look around
I can't believe the love I see.
My fears behind me, gone are the shadows and doubt
That was then, this is my now.

And I have the courage like never before, yeah.
I've settled for less now I'm ready for more,
Ready for more.

Then go but don't forget to leave my heart

You're no where to be found now
Once again here you are

Cause I'm always giving
Here waiting while you're living
I need a new beginning
Oh, I'm not the girl I used to be with you

You think maybe that I'm just so easy
You can come in and out my life like you please

Don't you know that you bringing flowers
Won't stop the rain baby no-no (uh-oh)

When I stayed with you but no more

I'm already looking around
Where did we get off the track
What was it that brought us down

I'm already waking up
How I've been asleep too long
Losing you is hard enough
Not knowing anything was wrong

Changes come but where they go?
You'll never know

Just another day like any other
Nothing in the sky said run for cover
Just another reason never thought it would end this way
There was no parade
No lights flashing
No songs to sing along the way
There was no parade

Boy you were supposed to last
You were never supposed to be
Just somebody in the past
Somebody I used to see

Trouble crept up on us
Warning never came a time
Before I knew it we were dust
Just left behind, left behind

Changes come but where they go?
You'll never know

Just another day like any other
Nothing in the sky said run for cover
Just another reason never thought it would end this way
There was no parade
No lights flashing
No songs to sing along the way
There was no parade
No waves crashing
There was no one else around for days
There was no parade

And after all the noise I never heard our last goodbye
It was silent as a butterfly

There was no parade
No lights flashing
No songs to sing along the way
There was no parade
No waves crashing
There was no one else around for days
There was no parade (no parade)

When you told me that I was a star in the sky,
Baby I believed every word.
And you seemed so sincere,
It was perfectly clear,
Cause forever was all that I heard.
And every little kiss,
From your tender lips,
Couldn't of been a lie.
I fell hard over head,
Without a safety net,
And I don't understand this goodbye.

Was I the only one who fell in love?
There never really was the two of us.
And maybe my all just wasn't good enough.
Was I the only one, only one, in love?

As I walk down the hall,
See the place on the wall,
Where the picture of us used to be.
I fight back those tears, cause I still feel you here.
How could you walk out so easily?
And I don't understand, how I can feel this pain, and still be alive.
And all these broken dreams,
And all these memories,
Are killing me inside.

Was I the only one who fell in love?

And maybe my all just wasn't good enough.
Was I the only one, only one,

Want nothing but flames illuminating my skin
I'm learning to know, is if you like it like this

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find

Vivendo essa agonia que me tira
A paz, um dia te levo comigo,
E de saudade sua eu não choro mais.

Quem tem amor assim distante,
Não tem o bastante pra
Sobreviver, pra todo mal da minha vida,
Pra curar qualquer ferida
Meu remédio é você

Não dá pra esquecer teus olhos,
Nem todos os beijos
Que você me dá.!
Não dá pra esquecer o cheiro,
E o ouro do cabelo a me iluminar.

A vida passa tão sem graça,
Mas quando você tá perto
Fica tudo bem
Eu corro a duzentos por hora
Mas se é pra te vê mais cedo
Eu posso ir bem mais além

Sofro e morro todo dia,
Vivendo essa agonia que me tira
A paz, um dia te levo comigo,
E de saudade sua
Eu não choro mais.

Não quero nem saber!
Eu só sei que a vida
É mais colorida com você, com você, yeyê

Olha aí o mundo girando
E a gente se esbarrando outra vez
Olha aí, o meu coração
Indo contra a razão
Sentimento não se desfez
Recaí quando te vi

Fui a nocaute, beijei a lona
O meu corpo tremeu
O tempo passou, a vida mudou
Mas eu continuo seu

Joga um balde de água fria
Só que não apaga o fogo, e eu quero de novo

Deixa eu pelo menos tentar te esquecer
Quero a minha paz, pra mim tanto faz

Jorge Aragão,"Meu amor se fosse assim assim
Bem calmo e mais sereno
Seria bem melhor pra mim pra mim
Um sorriso mais ameno

Nosso amor está pequeno
Cada vez mais dispersivo
O ciúme é um veneno
Não se encontra lenitivo

Se entre nós houvesse a paz dos bons casais
Sem receios, sem conflitos
Eu acredito, que haveria mais amor
Sem nossos gritos tão aflitos de pavor

Mais calor na relação, mais desejo de viver
Mais pureza, mais prazer, mais amor, mais união
Mas não deu termina aqui
Eu vou partir, mais não deu termina aqui",Termina Aqui
Jorge Aragão,"A saudade bateu no coração 
Naveguei na corrente da recordação 
Numa louca vontade de recomeçar 
Remendar nossa colcha de algodão 
E esquecer nosso amor pra me curar 
Do frio da solidão 

Só agora, infelizmente analisei 
Sua importância no meu mundo 
Quanta falta você faz em meu viver porque 
Um meio haverá de ter de não sofrer 
Um jeito de não ficar sempre a chorar 
Se o fim justifica o meio 
Você pode perdoar",Colcha de Algodão

De ser capoeira

Perdido no mundo

Que na passarela

cuando llegue el alba

la tristeza gris, de mi corazon,

todo nace en ti, como naci yo,

Jorge Celedon,"Como hago compañero pa' decirle que no he podido olvidarla
Que por más que lo intente 
Sus recuerdos siempre habitan en mi mente
Que no puedo pasar siquiera un día sin verla así sea desde lejos
Que siento enloquecer al verla alegre, sonreir y no es conmigo
Yo sé que le falté a su amor 
Tal vez por que a mi otra ilusión me sonreia
Y no pensé que sin ella en mi vida se me acabaria el mundo
Yo sé que estas arrepentido
Y duele pero ya no eres nadie en su vida
Ella encontró por quien vivir y que la busques tú es un absurdo
Olvídala, no es fácil para mí por eso quiero hablarle, si es
Preciso rogarle que regrese a mi vida
Inténtalo, es que no quiero hacerlo si por dejar sus sueños
Me causé mil heridas

Olvídala mejor, olvídala, arrancala de tí que ya tiene otro amor
Olvídala mejor, olvídala, arrancala de tí, ve y busca otra ilusión
Y es que no dejan los recuerdos
Si yo la enseñé a amar, fui su primer amor
No sale de mi pensamiento, aun ella vive aquí dentro del corazón
Olvídala mejor, olvídala, arrancala de tí que ya tiene otro amor
Olvídala mejor, olvídala, arrancala de tí, ve y busca otra ilusión

Hermano es tu deber luchar para olvidar así a quien no te quiere
A quien, gracias a dios, ya te olvidó y encontró amor en su camino
No sé si por venganza o por rencor o porque tú no le convienes
O tal vez fue que nunca perdonó que tú le hirieras el cariño
Mira que tú jugaste a los amores cuando eras todo en sus miradas
Yo sé que le falté debo pagarle pero que me perdone
Yo a ella la ví llorar amargas noches 
Cuando injustamente la cambiabas
Yo estoy arrepentido y quiero que ella olvide que tuve errores
Olvídala, yo no lo quiero hacer lucharé por tenerla
Ella es cielo, es estrella, ella es todo en mi vida
La quiero, no te digo mentiras 
Y aunque se pase el tiempo, por ella doy la vida
Olvídala mejor, olvídala
Arrancala de tí, que ya tiene otro amor
Olvídala mejor, olvídala
Arrancala de tí, ve y busca otra ilusión
Olvídala mejor, olvídala
Arrancala de tí que ya tiene otro amor

Jorge Cordova,"Me acuerdo y ya hace tiempo 
Cuando un recreo era mas que un trofeo 
Cuando ser pequeño, significaba que eras el 1º 
Y recibir un premio era encontrar el mejor delantero 
Metido en aquel cromo, tan buscado era tu tesoro 

Y gracias fue tan bonito 
Por darme tanto, cuando era niño 
Y gracias lo necesito 
Lo llevo dentro y 
Vive conmigo 

Hacer daño era trampa, multiplicar un lio 
Y regalar cariño no era competitivo 
Y a las diez en casa, me dejas un ratito!
Y de escribir mil cartas todo lo hemos perdido 

Y gracias fue tan bonito 
Por darme tanto, cuando era niño 
Y gracias lo necesito 
Lo llevo dentro y 
Vive conmigo 

Un problema era tarea, y el amor felicidad 
El verano era mas largo mi refugio era mama 
Nada se quedaba dentro yo sabia perdonar 
Siempre disfrutando el tiempo siempre siendo de verdad 

Aquellos 15 años, aquellos findes que lejos estan 
Aquellas ilusiones ya no se tienen no se sienten igual 
Aquellas noches largas, aquellas plazas, y esas ganas de amar 
Mi bici amarilla (amarilla y azul) y aquel verano nunca volveran 

Y gracias fue tan bonito 
Por darme tanto, cuando era niño 
Y gracias lo necesito 
Lo llevo dentro y 
Vive conmigo",Gracias

Jorge Dalto,"There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

I'm going to pick that rose 
And watch her as she grows in my garden

To and fro you sway, my heart's in time, I've learned to care

I'll learn to love forever, come what may

Que canta cuando ya no hay luz
Y desde la Playa del Faro 
La vieron flotar hacia el Sur

Vine a verte, aparecida, luz del mirador

Con el ocaso detenido 
El mar es menos que un rumor
Y da paso a cada sonido
A cada cambio de color
Me tiré solo hasta las dunas 
Con la primera oscuridad 
A verla andar sobre la espuma
Toda mentira y de verdad

Desde El Cabito hasta el farol
Colgándome de una botella

Diez días de carnaval

Cruzando Avenida Italia
Haciendo dedo hasta el Chuy
Mostrando el sello en la aduana
Diecinueve sin cumplir

Y ella que le preguntaba 
Dónde quedaba Uruguay

Y se reía al hablar
Su acento lo desarmaba

Jorge Drexler,"Nos delata el equipaje
Y la duda al caminar
Su prudencia pueblerina
Mi silencio en catalán
La niebla de Barcelona
Como un púdico tapiz

Y allá vamos, soñolientos
Tras la sombra de Gaudí

Poco importan las versiones
Los resabios de un lugar
Las postales consabidas
La edad de una catedral
La caricia minuciosa
De los siglos de humedad

Y las gárgolas te miran
Sobrevuelan la ciudad
Los mojones del camino
Con su ambigua cicatriz

Van marcando el fuselaje
Descascarando el barniz
La distancia es un oasis
Una forma de mentir

Visitamos los museos
Codiciando souvenirs

Una canción arcoiris
Durando en el tiempo

El director de la banda
Silbando bajito
Pensaba azules y rojos
Para el valsecito

Pero ustedes saben, señores
Muy bien cómo es esto
No nos falló la intención
Pero sí el presupuesto

En blanco y negro
Esta canción
Quedó en blanco y negro
Con el corazón
En blanco y negro
Nieve y carbón
En blanco y negro
En technicolor
Pero en blanco y negro

Fuimos quitando primero
De nuestra paleta
Una mirada turquesa
De marco violeta

Luego el carmín de las flores
Encima del piano
Una caída de sol
Cuando empieza el verano

Todo los tipos de verde
De una enredadera
Ya ni quedaban colores
Para las banderas

Nuestra intención ya no fué
Más que un viejo recuerdo
y esta canción al final
Se quedó en blanco y negro

En blanco y negro
Esta canción
Quedó en blanco y negro
Con el corazón
En blanco y negro
Nieve y carbón
En blanco y negro
En technicolor
Pero en blanco y negro",Dos Colores: Blanco y Negro
Jorge Drexler,"Érase una noche común
Era en una mesa de bar
Era enero en aquel lugar
Y ella me miró de una manera
Agua de mar

Era de fumar y reír
Era de saber esperar
Era de salir a buscar
No era una mirada cualquiera
Era de amar

Voy caminando por el fondo del mar
Voy caminando por el fondo del mar

Una gota pude tener
Todos los secretos del mar
Todo lo que pueda contar
Todo lo que vino después 
Era de imaginar

Voy caminando por el fondo del mar
Voy caminando por el fondo del mar",Era de Amar
Jorge Drexler,"Ven, cura esta pena
Quítame estas ganas de ti
Ven, que está frío fuera
Y haré tanto calor aquí

Te ví
Cruzar la calle
Y algo crujió dentro de mí

Ven, que ya se haré tarde
Y este tren se está por ir

Muy señora mía
Ten piedad de un simple mortal
Ven, cura esta herida
Este blues de incierto final

Traerá perfumes
Reflejos de estrella fugáz

 Ven, ya no lo dudes
No hará falta nada más

Tan sólo: nosotros dos",Ganas de Ti

Junto a tu pecho me calmaré
Házme un lugar en tu almohada

Te ira llevando en una nube 
Si no me duermo antes yo

Hay un rincón de tu pelo 
En el que yo me perfumaré
Hay un rincón de tu pelo 
Sobre la almohada esperándome

Una cascada azul 
Como la sombra de un jacarandá
Me iré acercando a tu mejilla 
Para escucharte respirar",Un Lugar en Tu Almohada
Jorge Drexler,"Mabel, dejó 
El bolso con unas amigas 
Y salió a bailar
Las luces violetas la protegían

Mintió la edad 
Cruzando la pista vacía
Y lo abrazó
Sonaban las lentas, lo permitían

Y la música siguió
Y la pista se llenó
Giraba conversando con él

Se habían visto alguna vez
Un baile en el club de Salinas
Los comentarios de rigor, y la mano en la espalda la sostenía
Un mostrador 
De mesas de salón de clase
La multitud
La luna de espejos giraba en el aire

Y la música ayudó
Vió la pista oscurecer
Su cuerpo recostándose en él

Mabel dudó
Pero no movió la mejilla
Y besó también
Fingiendo saber mientras aprendía

Y la música cambió
Y la música despertándose
Y aquel perfume nuevo en la piel",La Luna de Espejos

Es la Cruz del Sur

Tres Marías blancas van cruzando 
Un cielo color carbón

Si cuando vuelves a casa
Me ves sombrío
Dándole vueltas al vals

Y si me notas lejos
Estando a tu lado
Como una réplica mala 
De lo que yo era
Tómate en broma mi salto mortal

Que no hay nada peor para esta seriedad 
Que tomársela en serio

Jorge Drexler,"¿Dónde termina tu cuerpo y empieza el mío?
A veces me cuesta decir
Siento tu calor, siento tu frío
Me siento vacío si no estoy dentro de tí

¿Duánto de esto es amor? ¿cuánto es deseo?
¿De pueden, o no, separar? 
Si desde el corazón a los dedos
No hay nada en mi cuerpo que no hagas vibrar

¿Dué tendrá de real
Esta locura?
¿Quien nos asegura 
Que esto es normal?
Y no me importa contarte
Que ya perdí la mesura
Que ya colgué mi armadura en tu portal

Donde termina tu cuerpo y empieza el cielo 
No cabe ni un rayo de luz
¿Que fue que nos unió en un mismo vuelo?
¿Los mismos anhelos?
¿Tal vez la misma cruz?

¿Quien tiene razón?
¿Quien está errado?
¿Quien no habrá dudado
De su corazón?
Yo sólo quiero que sepas
No estoy aquí de visita
Y es para ti que está escrita esta canción",Fusión
Jorge Drexler,"Que viva la ciencia

Es cierto que no hay arte sin emoción
Y que no hay precisión sin artesanía
Como tampoco hay guitarras sin tecnología
Tecnología del nylon para las primas
Tecnología del metal para el clavijero
La prensa, la gubia y el barniz
Las herramientas de un carpintero

El cantautor y su computadora
El pastor y su afeitadora
El despertador que ya está anunciando la aurora
Y en el telescopio se demora la última estrella

La cucha del perro, la mantequilla
La yerba, el mate y la bombilla

Estás conmigo
Estamos cantando a la sombra de nuestra parra
Una canción que dice que uno sólo conserva lo que no amarra
Y sin tenerte, te tengo a vos y tengo a mi guitarra

Hay tantas cosas 
Yo sólo preciso dos

Hay cines

Hay cacerolas
Hay fórmulas hasta para describir la espiral de una caracola
Hay más: hay tráfico

Hay cápsulas hipnóticas y tomografias computarizadas
Hay condiciones para la constitución de una sociedad limitada
Hay biberones y hay obúses
Hay tabúes
Hay besos
Hay hambre y hay sobrepeso
Hay curas de sueño y tisanas
Hay drogas de diseño y perros adictos a las drogas en las aduanas

Hay manos capaces de fabricar herramientas 
Con las que se hacen máquinas para hacer ordenadores 
Que a su vez diseñan máquinas que hacen herramientas 
Para que las use la mano

Jorge Drexler,"Por cada muro un lamento
En jerusalén la dorada
Y mil vidas malgastadas
Por cada mandamiento
Yo soy polvo de tu viento
Y aunque sangro de tu herida
Y cada piedra querida
Guarda mi amor más profundo
No hay una piedra en el mundo
Que valga lo que una vida

Yo soy un moro judío
Que vive con los cristianos
No sé que dios es el mío
Ni cuales son mis hermanos

No hay muerto que no me duela
No hay un bando ganador
No hay nada más que dolor
Y otra vida que se vuela
La guerra es muy mala escuela
No importa el disfraz que viste
Perdonen que no me aliste
Bajo ninguna bandera
Vale más cualquier quimera
Que un trozo de tela triste

Yo soy un moro judío
Que vive con los cristianos
No sé que dios es el mío
Ni cuales son mis hermanos

Y a nadie le dí permiso
Para matar en mi nombre

Y si hay dios, así lo quiso

Músicas y versos
Que brotaban 
Desde tantos rincones

Yo estaba sólo, en un rincón del café
Cuando de pronto oí unas alas batir

Se va
Se va
Se fue

Tal vez fue algo de la puesta de sol
O algún efecto secundario del té
Pero lo cierto es que la pena voló
Y no importó ya ni siquiera porqué

Se va
Se va
Se fue

Algunas veces, mejor no preguntar
Por una vez que algo sale bien
Si todo empieza y todo tiene un final
Hay que pensar que la tristeza también

Jorge Drexler,"Tu beso se hizo calor
Luego el calor movimiento
Luego gota de sudor
Que se hizo vapor, luego viento

Que en un rincón de la rioja
Movió el aspa de un molino
Mientras se pisaba el vino
Que bebió tu boca roja

Tu boca roja en la mía
La copa que gira en mi mano
Y mientras el vino caía
Supe que de algún lejano rincón

De otra galaxia
El amor que me darías
Transformado volvería algún día
A darte las gracias

Cada uno da lo que recibe
Y luego recibe lo que da
Nada es más simple
No hay otra norma
Nada se pierde
Todo se transforma

El vino que pagué yo
Con aquel euro italiano
Que había estado en un vagón
Antes de estar en mi mano

Y antes de eso en torino
Y antes de torino en prato
Donde hicieron mi zapato
Sobre el que caería el vino

Zapato que en unas horas
Buscaré bajo tu cama
Con las luces de la aurora
Junto a tus sandalias planas

Que compraste aquella vez
En salvador de bahía
Donde a otro diste el amor
Que hoy yo te devolvería

Cada uno da lo que recibe
Luego recibe lo que da
Nada es más simple
No hay otra norma
Nada se pierde
Todo se transforma",Todo Se Transforma
Jorge Drexler,"Desde ahora mismo y aquí
Hacia donde quiera que estés
Parte de mi alma 
Parte a tu encuentro
Sabes que te llevo dentro mío
Igual que yo sé que tu me llevas dentro

Se trata de un leve pulsar
Que se abre camino hacia tí
Cruzando las estaciones, constelaciones
Los momentos
Digo que esta vida es llevadera
Sólo porque sientes tú
Lo que yo siento

Este es tu sitio
Ésta es tu taza de café

De lo que crees

Llevas el alma en el timón
Vas por la vida
Solo escuchando al corazón

Buscas un puerto
Buscas un cielo abierto
Lejos del dolor

Oh, oh, oh, Raquel

Tanto camino
Tanto buscarte en otra piel

A tu destino
Querías mantenerte fiel
Princesa herida
El teatro de la vida
Cambia tu papel

Oh, oh, oh, Raquel

La vida es larga y yo voy a seguir
Camino de tus brazos
Si el río corre, no puede más que ir

Que la vida es un tobogán
Duele menos soltar la baranda
Y dejarse llevar, dejarse llevar

Yo llevo tu sonrisa como bandera 
Y que sea lo que 
Sea 

Lo que tenga que ser, que sea 
Y lo que no por algo será 
No creo en la eternidad de las peleas 
Ni en las recetas de la felicidad 

Cuando pasen recibo mis primaveras 
Y la suerte este echada a descansar 
Yo miraré tu foto en mi billetera

Como le contó a su padre su abuelo

Resiste si se descarga en cada generación

Tampoco voy a contarla yo

Tocando el tambor le cuenta también
A su hijo mayor

Se cuenta en madera y cuero tensado por el calor 

y así va pasando de boca en boca 
De mano en mano que toca 
De corazón en corazón 
Historia que suena es la del candombe

Don't leave me dry

Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love

They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sassed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

It's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you've ever
The best thing you have ever had has gone away

Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Jorge Drexler,"Aquel mensaje que no debió haber leído
Aquel botón que no debió haber pulsado
Aquel consejo torpemente desoído
Aquel espacio era un espacio privado

Pero no tuvo ni tendrá la sangre fría 
Ni la mente clara, ni calculadora 
Que aun creyendo saber en lo que se metía 
Abrió una tarde aquella caja de Pandora 

Y la obsesión desencripta en lo críptico
Viola lo mágico, vence a la maquina 
Y tarde o temprano nada es secreto 
En los vericuetos de la informática
De la informática 

Hecho a mordisco en un lapso clandestino 
Tragando aquel dolor que se le atragantaba
Sintiendo claramente el riesgo, el desatino 
De la pendiente aquella en la que se deslizaba

Y en tres semanas que parecieron años 
Perdió las ganas de dormir y cinco kilos 
Y en flashback de celos aun siguen llegando 
Las frases que nunca debió haber leído

En esa espiral la lógica duerme 
Lo atávico al fin sale de reposo 
Y no hay contraseña, prudencia ni fin 
Que aguante el embate de un craquer celoso

Y la obsesión desencripta en lo críptico
Viola lo mágico, vence a la maquina 
Y tarde o temprano nada es secreto 
En los vericuetos de la informática

Jorge Drexler,"Voy en este vuelo transocéanico 
Oyendo tus versos melancólicos
Dejando que el sonido de tu voz 
Te traíga, así
Del modo más enérgico

Me regalastes tus somniferos
Me diste tu oráculo sintético
Extraño método 
De ahogar la sed, aquí
Lejos de tu lágrima

Y uno no recuerda 
Hasta que punto 
Nació para eso
Ni todo el amor 
Al que puede tener 
Acceso

Nada parece pasar página 
A este anhelo
Todo menos lánguido
¿Cuál es la lógica de que se 
Abra para mí 
Tu boca tan magnífica?

Y subiste tu apuesta,

No espera, no avisa

Tantos planes, tantos planes
Vueltos espuma

Tú por ejemplo
Tan a tiempo y tan inoportuna

Eran más bien los días
De arriar las velas
Toda señal a mi alrededor
Decía cautela

Cuánta estrategia incumplida
Aquella noche sin luna

Tan bienvenida y tan inoportuna

¿Cuándo es el momento de decir ahora?

¡Sin demora, sin demora!

¿De dónde has salido?""

Lo quiero todo

Y aunque parezca mentira

Tu corazón va a sanar
Va a sanar, va a sanar
Y va a volver a quebrarse
Mientras le toque pulsar

Y nadie sabe por qué un día el amor nace
Ni sabe nadie por qué muere el amor un día
Es que nadie nace sabiendo, nace sabiendo
Que morir, también es ley de vida

Así como cuando enfríe
Van a volver a pasar

Palabras sobre papel pentagramado
No te fijes mucho en lo que dicen
Me encontrarás
En cada cosa que he callado

Ya he dejado que se empañe

Que raro que seas tú
Quien me acompañe, soledad
A mi, que nunca supe bien
Cómo estar solo

Jorge Drexler,"Tomé un trago de veneno
De esos ojos de mujer
Seguí su canto en las rocas
Un descuido why naufragué

why hoy solo fumo callado
Cuando escucho hablar de amor
De ese fruto codiciado
Yo ya conozco el sabor

No ví la red escondida
La trampa esperándome
Creí sincera su entraga
Why por entero me entregué

Pero eso hare ya mucho
Ya aprendí de mi dilor
Why hoy solo fumo why escucho
Cuando siento hablar de amor

Me guías o yo te guío?

De un mismo aire
El pulso latiendo
Y el muslo aprendiendo a leer en Braille

Girando alrededor del fuego

Conocer la agricultura

Todos decían que no en las cancillerías
(Años de guerra caliente
Varios años antes de la guerra fría)

Todos decían que no
Cuando dijo que sí Bolivia

Berlín era un nido de ratas
El paladín de la bravata, gritaba
Llenaba estadios
De un árido erial de desvarío ario
Un árido erial de desvarío ario

Las puertas se iban cerrando
El tiempo colgaba de un pelo
Y aquel niño en los brazos de mis abuelos

Y el pánico era evidente
Y todo lo presagiaba
El miedo ganaba cauce
Abría fauces, vociferaba
Y entonces llegó del frío
En pleno glaciar hiriente
Una insólita vertiente de agua tibia

Todos decían que no
Cuando dijo que sí Bolivia

Y el péndulo viene y va
Y vuelve a venir e irse
Y tras alejarse vuelve
Y tras volver, se distancia
Y cambia la itinerancia
Y los barcos van y vienen
Y quienes hoy todo tienen
Mañana por todo imploran
Y la noria no demora
En invertir los destinos
En refrescar la memoria

Y los caminos de ida
En caminos de regreso
Se transforman, porque eso

No más que eso, es la historia",Bolivia

Jorge Drexler,"Voy con una trayectoria lenta
Por mucho que me mueva siempre me encuentro
En un punto dado de una esfera
Que te tiene como centro

Justo cuando estoy a punto de entenderte
Te miro y me desconcentro
Mis ojos siempre volarán a verte
Solo es cuestión de tiempo
Van orbitando equidistantes un puñado de canciones
Giran a tu alrededor como electrones

Lalala lalala lalala uh
A tu alrededor como electrones

Lalala lalala lalala uh
A tu alrededor como electrones

Tu y tu leve tul de nubes
Que forman de vapor su propia esfera
Perdí la cuenta de las veces que te anduve
Todas parecen la primera

Giran a tu alrededor como electrones

Con su microscopio
De desasosiego

Hay cosas para las que no

Inevitablemente cede
Se mueve a tu vaivén

Te hice un sitio en mi mesa
Con una calma impostada
Te sostuve la mirada
Aparentando entereza

Me volví perro de presa
Del perfume de tu pelo
Disimulando el anhelo
Mirando hablar a tu boca

Todas mis brújulas locas
Cambiándome el plan de vuelo

Y ahora que todo lo triste
Con el tiempo se deshizo
Yo me pregunto
Por qué desapareciste
Sin el más mínimo aviso

Pero más que todo seré enamora'o

Se me reconozca por mi valentía

Antes que rajarme, me aguanto y me río 

Me gusta el sombrero, echado de la'o

Jorge Negrete,"Me canse de rogarle me canse de decirle,
Que yo sin ella de pena muero,
Ya no quiso escucharme si sus labios se abrieron,
Fue pa' decirme ya no te quiero.

Yo sentí que mi vida se perdía en un abismo profundo
Y negro como mi suerte, quise hallar el olvido al estilo Jalisco

no te rajes

Pero aquellos mariachis y aquel tequila me hicieron llorar.

Me canse de rogarle. con el llanto en mis ojos mi copa y brinde con ella,
No podía despreciarme era el ultimo brindis de un bohemio con una reina.
Los mariachis callaron.

De mi mano sin fuerza cayo mi copa sin darme cuenta
Ella quiso quedarse cuando vio mi tristeza
Pero ya estaba escrito que aquella noche perdiera su amor.",Ella
Jorge Negrete,"Desde el campo en que he nacido
Vengo a echar una visteada
A la fiesta de mi rancho
Rebosante de ilusión

A las mujeres bonitas
Traigo flores perfumadas
Y a los charros cumplidores
Traigo mi mejor canción

Hay que bonita es la fiesta del rancho
Donde huele el aire puro a ventana y almidón
Donde un beso sabe a gloria
Debajo de un sombrero ancho
Y nos cobija un sarape corazón con corazón

El jarabe zapateado saca astillas al tablado
Y el mariachi entusiasmado lanza sones sin parar
El palenque se rebosa con la sangre de un tapado
Y una china coquetona busca amores al cantar

Apuéstenle al gallo giro que va contra el colorado
Este gallo nunca pierde pues lo traigo bien calado
Hagan apuestas señores aprovechen la ocasión
Que al cabo a los ganadores no les cobro comisión

Hay que rechulo es el ranchito mío
Donde todo el mundo olvida los pesares y el dolor
Para ver mujeres lindas hay que estar en el bajío
Es gigante la hermosura y cobijo de mi amor

Hay es la fiesta de la tierra mía
Que se alegra con los cantos del mariachi retozón
Y esta linda que se adorna con la clara luz del día
Desbordante de entusiasmo de calor y de emoción

Jorge Negrete,"Como espuma 
Que inerte lleva el caudaloso rio 
Flor de azalea la vida en su avalancha te arrastro

Hallar pudiste proteccion y abrigo 
Donde curar tu corazon herido por el dolor

Refleja el paso de las horas negras

La mas amarga desesperacion 
Hoy para siempre 
Quiero que olvides tus pasadas penas

Jorge Negrete,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Polvo de Estrellas

Jorge Negrete,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Jorge Rico,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?",Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)

It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine

One more night cos I can't wait forever

Jorge Rico,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",The Windmills of Your Mind

Ela está em todas as coisas

É chão que chega a dar um nó

Flor de algodão, meu pensamento
Pulou muro, foi embora, looping no ar
Numa corrente de verão
Pro ninho de algum um pardal, décimo andar
Pela janela, cai no pêlo
De um cachorro animado pra passear
No ventilador do elevador
Lá vai a minha ilusão, flor de algodão
Quase passou carro por cima
Atravessou a rua inteira na contramão
Se estatelou pelas vitrines
Mais um golpe de ar, vai passear
A tarde inteira pra pousar
Na sua mão

Eu não sou de olhar o que passou
Nem lamentar o que se foi
Sou de criar o que será
É como os relógios de Dalí
É como as torres de Gaudí
Como Brasília para Oscar
Ou no arremesso de um outro Oscar

Assim eu vou no vento
Sou uma folha de pensamento
Einstein andou no tempo
Cruzou paredes e riu por dentro

É,nosso futuro assim será
Feito uma escada a se formar 
Por sob os pés de quem sonhar
De quem ousar pensar além

Nem lamentar o que se foi
Sou de criar o que será
De quem ousar pensar além",Numa Corrente de Ver達o

E meu olhar distante deixe lá
Que em pensamento

Não dá ponto sem nó

Sou uma seringueira
Aberta a te esperar
Tô te trazendo
Em pensamento só pra mim

Eu bem tava dizendo e olha lá
Pois cedo ou tarde

Jorge Vercillo,"Quando menino eu troquei a bola pela viola
E fiz da praia do Leme
O meu Abaeté com os amigos
Futebol na areia após a escola
Musa de tantos versos ela ainda é

Atravessava o túnel Novo a pé
Até o Canecão pra descobrir aquilo
Que me fez quem sou
Voltava em zigue-zague
Como as pedras sobre calçadão
E ocupava a beça o som do meu irmão

Craque, Buarque de Holanda
Qual o anjo que te ronda
Quando raias a escrever? 
E se o que chega aos seus ouvidos
É divino pra você?
Milton desenha com a sua voz
Os trilhos e o relevo
Nas linhas em tua mão
És em pessoa o Ouro Preto
Nas minas da canção
Nas minas da canção

Transparência é a melodia 
A rebrilhar na voz de Gal
Como um raio laser no cristal

Caí na Noite
Nos bares da vida, na madrugada
Cantei na Penha, no Leblon e Santa Cruz
Garis, Vigias e violeiros
São como Exu e Batman
Rondam nas sombras 
Mas a serviço da luz

Eu me entreguei de corpo e alma
Para a dor e a alegria
De ter a música 
Como crença,como um deus
O meu amor,o meu sustento
Minha sabedoria tudo que eu tenho
Foi a música quem deu

A face ainda não vista
De um povo a se inventar

Jorge Vercillo,"A rebatida pra quem tá na zaga
É um desespero, teve agarra agarra

Sobre a área faz curva
E só a reza resta para o arqueiro

Avisaram, olha o ladrão!
Ele nem viu chegar
Agora volta, vem cavando falta
Bola perdida, contra ataque
É um pega pra capar

Mas de um segundo para o outro
O rumo dessa prosa vai mudar
Dando um chapéu, gingando o corpo
Entortando, eu me livrei de dois ou três
Entre canetas de um zagueiro
O outro tenta em vão me segurar
Foi só passar pelo goleiro 
Eu caí da cama e acordei
Foi só passar pelo goleiro
Eu caí da cama e acordei
Foi só passar pelo goleiro do Polytheama

Quando seu time toma um gol relâmpago

Jorio,"I am a shotgun rider,
For the San Jacinto line,
The desert is my brother,
My skin is cracked and dry
I was ridin' on a folk coach
And everything was fine,
'Till we took a shorter road
To save some time
The bandits only fired once,
They shot me in the chest
They may have wounded me but,
They'll never get the best
Of better men
'Cause I'll ride again

I am a river gambler,
I make a livin' dealin' cards
My clothes are smooth and honest,
My heart is cold and hard
I was shufflin' for some delta boys,
On a boat for New Orleans,
I was the greatest shark they'd ever seen
But the captain bumped a sandbar,
And an ace fell from my sleeve
They threw me overboard,
As I swore I didn't cheat
But I could swim
And I'll ride again

We are heroes of the homeland, American remains
We live in many faces and answer many names
We will not be forgotten, we won't be left behind
Our memories live on in mortal minds
And poets pens

I am a mid-west farmer,
I make a livin' off the land,
I ride a John Deere tractor,
I'm a liberated man
But the rain it hasn't fallen,
Since the middle of July,
And if it don't come soon my crops will die
The bank man says he likes me,
But there's nothin' he can do
He tells me that he's comin',
But the clouds are comin' too
He ain't my friend
And I'll ride again

I am an American Indian,
My tribe is Cherokee
My forefathers loved this land
They left it here for me
But the white man came with boats,
And trains and dirty factories,
An' poisoned my existence with his deeds
Nature is our mother,
We are suckling at her breast
And he who tries to beat her down,
Will lose her to the rest
They'll never win
I'll ride again

Nur du kannst mich lesen wie ein offenes Buch
Und das tut mir gut
Und ich spring wenn ich spring soll
Und renn wenn du rennst

Lege alle Karten offen
Setze alles auf dich

Oh wir haben unser Hollywood gelebt
Bloß das Drehbuch selbst geschrieben
Szene zwei spazieren im Park
Kein Geheimnis, haben uns alles schon gesagt
Oh wir haben unser Hollywood verlebt

Ich seh die Tränen in deinem Gesicht
Ist das Ende? Warum weine ich dann nicht?

Wer ist Ich

Wer ist Ich

Szene fünf der Film ist aus
Das Skript noch da aber die Schauspieler sind raus, hab grad
Ein letztes Mal den Film gesehen
Seh dich wieder vor mir stehen
Und jetzt frage ich mich
Ich seh die Tränen in deinem Gesicht
Ist das Ende? Warum weine ich dann nicht?

Wer ist Ich
Wer ist Ich
Wer ist Ich

Ich wollt niemals der sein der dich einfach so stehen lässt
Fast ohne Worte unser Hollywood gehn lässt

Oh ich tue dir weh

Ich bin viel zu träge, trotzdem lauf ich zu schnell
Bin im Tag reichlich dunkel, in der Nacht viel zu hell
Ich hab noch so viel zu sagen, indes find ich kein Wort
Will doch nur noch nach Hause

Bitte öffne die Augen und nimm mich in' Arm

Aufwärts, in ein unbekanntes Land

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Lose their taste for kissing?

Jorma Kaukonen,"Well, walking liquor has done me wrong 
I can't sleep night or day
A terrible feelin' that comes along 
When the kick it begins to get away
Poison and a mixture or two 
They call it sugar of lead
If you drink bootleg 'shine
You'll sure have an achin' head

Did you ever wake up on a Sunday morn
With snakes all around your bed
I know you have. I have, too 
I know I'd rather be dead
The preacher comes around 
And gives advice, and then
You have to stall
But if he gets to the bottle first 
You know, he'll never leave you none at all.

I tell you, brother, and I won't lie 
What's the matter in this land
They drink it wet and vote it dry 
And hide it if they can
They'll pitch a party 
And they'll all get drunk 
And call it society
But if they catch you with a pint 
Good mornin' penitentiary

Well, prohibition has killed more folks
Than Sherman ever seen.
If they don't get whiskey 
They'll take to dope
Cocaine, and morphine
This ol' country it sure ain't dry 
And dry will never be seen
Prohibition is just a scheme 
A fine money makin' machine

Carbolic acid and creosote 
Ought to kill any man
Some get paralyzed, some get well 
Some hit the Golden Land
The undertaker has got to live 
Beat him if you can
Prohibition, say it again
Is a money makin' fine machine",Prohibition Blues

And she looks like a water fowl

Jorma Kaukonen,"All around the water tower
Waiting for a train
A thousand miles away from home
Sleeping in the rain
I walked up to a brakeman
To give him a line of talk
He said if you've got money
You won't have to walk
Well, I haven't got a nickel
Not a penny can I show
Get off, get off you railroad bum
And he slammed that boxcar door

Well, he put me off in Texas
A state I dearly love
Wide open spaces all around me
The moon and stars up above
Nobody seems to want me
Or give me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco
Going back to Dixieland
My pocketbook is empty
An' my heart is full of pain

I want your smile
When you smile at me in the morning
And it's been so long since I felt at home in your love

Was it time I, once came running
Down the streets we used to melt
That was when I still had something

Help me if you please
Give me the right area code

Singing like a summer breeze

Down about Baton Rouge
But I just can't remember no number
A number I can use, directory don't have it
Central done forgot it
Got to find a number to use

Trying to check out her number
Trying to run down her line
Operator said that's privileged information
And it ain't no business of mine
It's flooding down in Texas, the poles are down in Utah

Working in a house of blue light
Riding a getaway bus out of Portland

Contracts and lawyers
And champagne downtown
Tell me what you think
You want me to do
I've been always fair with you
Turning on me
After all we've been through
You want trouble then that's just
The way it will be

You're caught up in the power
A blue magical maze
Now the circle is broken
In a spellbinding rage
Better see if you're holdin'
The wrong edge of the blade

If it's sharp, 
If it cuts

Stranded in this world
So little time, there's no rewind
Must be strong and carry on

As the light of the moon catches me
I live, I live
As the stars shimmer bright for me
I live, I live

I am the footprint in the sand
I am the wind that sweeps the land
I am the eyeglass of a blinded man
In the heat of desire
I'm a starfire
Fallen down from the sky

So many choices, where will they lead us?
Don't know where to go
Grateful children for they are future
Teach them how to play

As the light of the moon catches me
I live, I live
As the stars shimmer bright for me
I live, I live

I am the footprint in the sand
I am the wind that sweeps the land
I am the eyeglass of a blinded man
In the heat of desire

I am the eyeglass of a blinded man
In the heat of desire

Fallen down from the sky

I am the sunshine and the rain
I am the hurt, I am the pain
I am the soldier without a name

So little time, there's no rewinding
I am the sunshine and the rain
I am the hurt, I am the pain

On the day that I was born
They tried to bless me with holy water
But I was baptized in a storm... Oh yeahhh

I sent out the arrow from behind my defense shield
Eternal dreamer so full of lite
A faithful believer soon I will arise

Closer to balance as the end draws neare... Oh yeahh

Go look for something real

And the melody is my guide
Sailing the waters
Of this endless lullaby
My ship is leaking
Can't stop it if I try... Ohh

In silence bleeding is the heartbroken man

Out in the day I'm finding my way
People are dreaming they've got so much to say
Darker than coal in the core of my soul
On fire breathing burning out of control

Tell me who we are coming from afar
Seek the distant star in a flying car
It's a future world go and get your girl
Reach for the sky till the end of time

Sun's going black it's the eclipse of my heart
My wounds are open from a life torn apart
Keep up the pace in this digital race
This time machine has got me trapped in a blaze

And the wind must blow as the rivers flow
Will we ever now if the truth will show
In another world just a boy and girl
Holding on the end of the line

I hear footsteps in the hole my friend
But no one's there as I look again
Feeling ice cold as I walk the stairs... oh
And suddenly she's there
I see her floating through the air

We all fade to begin again
With science dreaming every woman and man

Tell me what she did tell me who she was
Show me how she loved here before
Did she run around with the boys in town
Living fast at the end of the line... no time

Coming faster

Que escogió pa' visitarla
La virgen del Tepeyac

Es el 15 de septiembre una fecha
Que todos los mexicanos
Recordamos con honor
Es el día que levantamos

La bandera más bonita
Es el día que recordamos
Lo que hidalgo principio
Que repiquen

Las campanas de dolores
Y al compas de los acordes
De nuestro himno nacional

Viva México gritemos
Que aunque estemos como estemos
No nos echamos pa' tras

Viva México completo
Nuestro México repleto
De belleza sin igual
Esta tierra que es la tierra
Que escogió pa' visitarla
La virgen del Tepeyac

José Alfredo Jiménez,"Le pinte un cuatro al coyote
y me fui para la sierra

El coyote era un bandido
nacido allá por mi tierra
lo conocí desde niño
fuimos juntos  a la escuela

A las primeras lecciones
Se sabía lo que intentaba
Porque cantaba canciones
Peleando con su guitarra
y aunque perdiera ilusiones
Con sus ojos no lloraba

Aquella noche de mayo
Le gusto mi María Elena
Pero yo llegue a caballo
Ya tenia cita con ella

Cuando baje de la sierra
Me encare con el Coyote
y abrazando a Maria Elena
Le dije ya tiene nombre
Porque en la ermita sagrada
Nos caso el cura del monte

El agacho la cabeza
y se fue cobardemente
Pero como era coyote
Se devolvió de repente
El me buscaba la espalda
Pero yo le halle la frente

Coyote, coyote altivo
Que no respetaste amores
Pudiendo se buen amigo 
te mataron tus traiciones

José Alfredo Jiménez,"Cantinero que todo lo sabes 
He venido a pedirte un consejo 
Pero quiero que tu no me engañes 
No me digas que no eres parejo 
Ya tome mil botellas contigo 
Y me has dicho las cosas mas crueles 
No me digas que no soy tu amigo 
Y confiesa tambien que la quieres 

Yo no voy a matarme por nadie 
Yo mi vida la vivo borracho 
Si me cambia por ti que bonito 
Tomaremos los dos a lo macho 

Cantinero que todo lo puedes 
No me tengas respeto ni miedo 
Tu me das un balazo si quieres 
Yo aunque quiera pegarte no puedo 
Se me doblan las piernas de sueño 
Dame pues otra mugre botella 
Pero dime que tu eres su dueño 
Y brindemos contentos por ella 

Yo no voy a matarme por nadie 
Te la dejo, por dios te la dejo 
Pero choca tu copa conmigo 
Y me das o te doy un consejo",El Cantinero
José Alfredo Jiménez,"Ay amor amor de jalisco lindo
Un tequila y un beso el mismo día
Para andar de borracho
Y seguirte queriendo todavía
Un tequila y un beso el mismo día
O prefiero tus labios o prefiero la copa
Tú me dices lo que hago, vida mía

Yo te voy a adorar
Y me voy a entregar
Con las fuerzas del hombre que no tiene
Tú lo vas a sentir y tendrás que vivir
Este amor que tal vez te conviene
Y si no pues mala suerte cariño

Ya que se haga de noche, el mismo día
Veme abriendo los brazos
Y volvemos las penas, alegrías

A mis años estoy enamorado, 
Tengo el pelo completamente blanco 
Pero voy a sacar juventud de mi pasado

Porque tú no has querido

José Alfredo Jiménez,"Me canse de rogarle me canse de decirle,
Que yo sin ella de pena muero,
Ya no quiso escucharme si sus labios se abrieron,
Fue pa' decirme ya no te quiero.

Yo sentí que mi vida se perdía en un abismo profundo
Y negro como mi suerte, quise hallar el olvido al estilo Jalisco

no te rajes

Pero aquellos mariachis y aquel tequila me hicieron llorar.

Me canse de rogarle. con el llanto en mis ojos mi copa y brinde con ella,
No podía despreciarme era el ultimo brindis de un bohemio con una reina.
Los mariachis callaron.

De mi mano sin fuerza cayo mi copa sin darme cuenta
Ella quiso quedarse cuando vio mi tristeza
Pero ya estaba escrito que aquella noche perdiera su amor.",Ella

Es por eso que quiero gritar 
Sin matar ilusiones

Y anduve borracho, borracho perdido
De tanto quererte, yo me acuerdo, que estaba chiquillo
Y no iba a la escuela, porque no aguantaba, seis horas sin verte
Siempre juntos, creció mi cariño, y un día me gritaste
Me gustan los hombres, me aburren los niños
Y ahí te voy, a quebrar mi destino
Y en una cantina, cambie mis canicas, por copas de vino
Que coraje, me daba conmigo
No tenia bigote, ni traía pistola, ni andaba a caballo
Que coraje, me daba conmigo
Andaba descalzo, y a ti te gustaban, las botas de charro

Fui dejando, que el tiempo pasara
Luche contra todo, sentí que los años, caían en mi espalda
Y una noche, que no te esperaba
Volviste en silencio, y le diste un beso, a mi boca cerrada
No te pude, decir que te fueras
Ni quise que vieras, que estuve escribiendo, mil veces tu nombre
Solo se, que te puse en mis brazos
Deje que mi orgullo se hiciera pedazos
Al fin ya era un hombre, que coraje, me daba conmigo
No tenia bigote, ni traía pistola, ni andaba a caballo

Por si acaso te diera vergüenza 
Si algún día sin querer tropezamos 
No te agaches ni mi hables de frente

Para ver si me puedo quitar
Una pena que traigo en al alma
Que me agobia y que me haré llorar

Si me encuentro por ahí con la muerte
A lo macho no la he de temer
Si su amor lo perdí para siempre
Qué me importa la vida perder

Ya traté de vivir sin mirarla
Ya luché por no ser infeliz
Y tan solo encontré dos caminos
O lograrla o dejar de vivir

Ésta noche le doy serenata,
No me importa perder o ganar,
Ésta noche le canto a la ingrata,
Tres canciones que la hagan llorar.

Si me matan al pie de su reja,
A lo macho me harían un favor,
Que más puedo pedirle a la vida,
Que morirme juntito a mi amor.

Ya traté de vivir sin mirarla,
Ya luche por no ser infeliz,
Y tan solo encontré dos caminos,
O dejarla o dejar de vivir.",Esta Noche

Dejame estar a tu lado
Cerquita de tu alma
Juntito al dolor

Déjame verte llorando

Que estas derramando
Por un mal amor

Sigue sangrando la herida
Que un día de la vida
Me dió tu querer

Sigo buscando consuelo
Sigo pidiéndole al cielo
Que seas en mi vida
Lo que ya no fue

Déjame hablarte en secreto
Quiero decirte al oido
Que mi último nido
También fracasó

Pero tú no hagas recuerdos
Dale al pasado tu olvido
Why empieza otra vida
Sin ver tu dolor

buscando horizontes, pensando y sintiendo.

Eso que un día mi padre
trató de explicarme con tantos ejemplos,
viviendo su vida de cada momento,
mirando al destino con ojso sinceros.

Eso que algunos regalan
o venden en cuotas a muy bajo precio,
sintiéndose luego vacíos por dentro,
buscando razones, negando y mintiendo.

Eso que algunos escriben
y que luego esconden temblando de miedo,
sintiendo la fuerza tremenda del viento
que crece al oir su voz.
Eso se llama LIBERTAD.

Eso se llama ternura,
se llama coraje, se llama locura,
se llama mi amigo, mi patria, mi sueño,
se llama mis manos, se llama te quiero.
Eso se llama LIBERTAD.",Las Cosas Por Su Nombre
Jose Augusto,"Corazón,dime a mi
¿Por qué yo siempre termino sin aliento?
Corazón,no seas así
Te apasionas y en mi pecho hay sufrimiento

¿Por qué tenias que entregarte así?
Si en realidad solo quería una aventura
¿Por qué mejor no paras de soñar?
Era un deseo y nada mas

Y ahora que es lo que hago
Para olvidar tanta dulzura
Que me esta llevando a la locura
No es justo entrar así en mi vida
No es correcto no dejar salida
No lo es

Ahora aguanta corazón
Ya que inventaste esta pasión
Yo te conté, tenia miedo
Amar no es tan solo un juego
Ahora aguanta corazón
Tu ya no tienes salvación
Te entregas y te olvides que tu eres yo

Jose Augusto,"Coração... diz pra mim 
Por que é que eu fico sempre desse jeito?
Coração... não faz assim
Você se apaixona e a dor é no meu peito
Pra que que você foi se entregar
Se na verdade eu só queria uma aventura?
Por que você não pára de sonhar 
É um desejo e nada mais
E agora o que é que eu faço 
Pra esquecer tanta doçura
Isso ainda vai virar loucura
Não é justo entrar na minha vida
Não é certo não deixar saída, não é não

Agora agüenta coração
Já que inventou essa paixão
Eu te falei que eu tinha medo 
Amar não é nenhum brinquedo

Me conta
Me diz
Como vai sua vida
Mas diz a verdade com jeito

Engana que sente saudade
Que ainda não me esqueceu
Que seu amor ainda sou eu

Confessa que eu tinha razão
E você estava errada
Disfarça
E não diz que esse outro 
Te faz mais feliz

É porque eu te amo
Quando eu digo que não quero mais você

E confessar que eu estou em tuas mãos
Mas não posso imaginar
O que vai ser de mim
Se eu te perder um dia

Eu me afasto e me defendo de você
Mas depois me entrego
Faço tipo, falo coisas que eu não sou
Mas depois eu nego
Mas a verdade
É que eu sou louco por você
E tenho medo de pensar em te perder
Eu preciso aceitar que não dá mais
Pra separar as nossas vidas

E nessa loucura de dizer que não te quero
Vou negando as aparências
Disfarçando as evidências
Mas pra que viver fingindo
Se eu não posso enganar meu coração
Eu sei que te amo
Chega de mentiras
De negar o meu desejo
Eu te quero mais que tudo
Eu preciso do seu beijo
Eu entrego a minha vida
Pra você fazer o que quiser de mim
Só quero ouvir você dizer que sim

Diz que é verdade, que tem saudade

Que ainda você quer viver pra mim",Evidencias

Nao fique triste

Saudade existe pra quem sabe ter,
Minha vida cigana me afastou de voce,
Por algum tempo que eu vou ter que viver por aqui, longe de voce,
Longe do seu carinho
E do seu olhar, que me acompanha ja tem muito tempo
Penso em voce a cada momento
Sou agua de rio que vai para o mar
Sou nuvem nova que vem pra molhar essa noiva que e voce

Pra mim voce e linda

Que bate tanto quando te ve

Que não sente mais nada
Que o sonho acabou

Você fala de amor 
Feito um jogo de cartas marcadas
Como roupa surrada

De repente você já nem vê
O que faz mais sentido
E me joga na cara palavras
Que fazem doer demais
Bate a porta e me deixa assim
Sem saber o que eu faço de mim
Sem saber o que eu digo pra mim
Se você me deixar

Que é que eu faço amanhã
Quando eu me levantar
E não ter mais teu corpo pra me aconchegar
Não sentir teus abraços
Querendo apertar o que sempre foi teu

Quando ela chegar
E o desejo na boca querendo beijar

José Carreras,"Because you're mine the brightest star I see looks down
My love, and envies me because you're mine
Because you're mine because you're mine
The breeze that hurries by becomes a melody
And why, because you're mine, because you're mine
I only know for as long as I may live
I'll only live for the kiss that you alone may give me
And when we kiss that isn't thunder dear
It's only my poor heart you hear, and it's applause

José Carreras,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

José Carreras,"""This is half a moment to be true.
Just you're here as long as I'm with you.""

Half a moment
We are together
I shall want no-one else
And nothing new.
Half a moment
I shall treasure,
Keep it locked away
For some future rainy day.
Should you leave me
With just this moment
In my mind
I shall capture it anew,
Like some picture
Taken in my childhood
Half a moment
Spent with you.
Countless vivid memories
Spin before my view,
Like some toy kaleidoscope
Images of you.

[Chorus]
Time looks kindly
On fleeting lovers
They can turn the briefest hour
Into a day
Turn a moment
To a lifetime
Making it to last
Blending future with the past.

We're together,
What else can matter?
Even though
Half a moment is too few

I shall save it
'Til I have another
Making one whole moment
Filled with you.",Half a Moment

jugosa manzana

José Carreras,"The rains never came I saw my land die
Maria was sleeping when I kissed her goodbye
I couldn't stand the sound of my children cryin' no more
You get hungry you get mad
A man without hope is a man that turns bad
I'll try my luck in texas adios mexico

Wipe away your tears maria
There's a better life for us somewhere
Let me see you smile maria
Close your eyes we're on our way there

My country was a great one once upon a time
I wish I lived when you didn't need borderlines
Somebody came and took the heart of my people away
Now I ain't worried baby come hear what I say
My people gonna rise again fightin' someday
I'll be there to see it I'll be there to welcome them home

Wipe away your tears maria
There's a better life for us somewhere
Let me see you smile maria
Close your eyes we're on our way there

I saw Texas she looked so fine
I met some other people same story as mine
Laughin' and drinkin' waitin' for the sun to go down
We had life in our eyes as we crossed the border line
Shot six good men without tellin' them why
How could anybody steal the only thing a man has left

José Carreras,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
