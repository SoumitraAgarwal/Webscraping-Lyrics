One to the Father who helps us believe that
Nothin's ever gonna harm you see an

The movement (the movement)
Is like a phenomenon (is like a phenomenon)
You never know where it's comin' from
You never know when the next big sound gonna come
Baghdad, Hong Kong
Tokyo, King Kong
Synagogue, singsong
Hot beat, car bomb
Don't matter who's on the chart number one
Spearhead sound for the people everyone
Thunder comes from the bass and the drum
Rain or shine never stop anyone
I like my bass loudy, loudy, louder!
I like my bass loudy, loudy, louder!

Ha ha ha ha, ah yes yes yes yes
Touchin' down on mother earth
I take mud and turn it into pottery
Lottery, I give all a chance
As I welcome all to the dance
Angel (oh?), criminal (who?), animal (wha?), mineral
And spiritual
All sinners, all head-spinners
So-called experts, we're all beginners
Enter, the age of aquarians
Carnivores, and vegetarians
It's the next sound wave
Soon I may ah, ask you to behave
El presidente, you behave
Once war stops sendin' us to the grave
Vamanos, Vamanos, all walls will fall like dominoes
Earthquakin' and shakin'
Please don't stop, rock

Yes, all walls will fall
All walls will fall
I never quit, I never give up
I'd hate to have me as my own enemy
Because
Music is not competition
Music is not repetition
Music is love, love for the masses, for all classes
Love conquers all
Love accepts all
Love respects all
Love dares to dream (A Love Supreme, A Love Supreme)
Soldier of fortune, open your cookie
Unfold the paper, stop looky looky
Takin' order, the march to the kitchen
Food for the masses, that's the new mission
Salam shalom, shalom salam
The one sound louder than a bomb
The whole world sings this song
Check it, stop, rock

Hold up, hold up, I forgot something
I like my bass loudy, loudy, louder (x2)

This track is love fortified
This track is love amplified
This track combats genocide
Seven inch jamaican forty five
Take a trip, Gaza, strip
IDs, a bob up ? flip
I rock, black scorpions
And a shout out to ethiopians
Shot rings out everybody gonna run
A woman cries out for the loss of her son
Hold it high everybody everyone
All roads lead to love or the one

Don't you forget why you came to the dance
Might never ever be another better chance 
Might never ever be another better chance

Don't you forget why you came to the dance
The drums and bass are the king of the dance

Michael Franti,"I don't need a passport
To walk on this earth,
Anywhere I go cause I was made of this earth
I'm born of this earth,
I breathe of this earth,
And even with the pain I believe in this earth, so
I wake up every mornin' and I'm steppin' on the floor,
I wake up every mornin' and I'm stepping out the door

I got faith in the sky,
Faith in the one,
Faith in the people rockin' underneath the sun
'Cause every bit of land is a holy land and
Every drop of water is a holy water and
Every single child is a son or a daughter of the one
Earth mama and the one Earth papa, so
Don't tell a man that he cant come here cause he got
Brown eyes and a wavy kind of hair, and
Don't tell a woman that she cant go there because she
Prays a little different to a God up there
You say you're a Christian
'Cause God made you
You say you're a Muslim
'Cause god made you
You say you're a Hindu and the next man a Jew
Then we all kill each other
'Cause God told us to nah!

Michael Franti,"[Chorus]
Don't tell the DJ got to turn it low
We keep it rockin' til the early morn I say
Hey Now Now, I say hey now now
Don't tell the people that they got to go
I wanna keep em 'til the early morn i say
Hey Now Now, I say hey now now

You've been a soldier girl
and I would do anything for you
It's true, it's true
I wanna be in the early morn',
I'm gonna light up the night for you,
It's true, it's true

[Chorus]

Run come come comin' a join in this party
The rhythm of the music make me feelin' irie
Hey now it doesn't matter where you comin' from a'
Dancin' to the riddim of the feelin' of the drumma
Choose to do the things that make the people come together
Use the money maker that was given from your mama
Hey now selecta wanna get ya rub a dubba
Come come come til the sun shine on

[Chorus]

Be who you are nothing more nothing less
and let the beauty that you love be√É¬¢?√Ç¬¶.. the very best
Sing praises to the highest with your feet on the ground
And reach for your brother with the words that you sound and
Don't let mistakes be so monumental, and
Don't let your love be so confidential, and
Don't let your mind be so darn judgmental
And please let your heart be more influential.

Be thankful for all the Spirit provides
And be thankful for all that you can see without eyes
Give thanks to music that keeps us alive
And give thanks to all DJ's worldwide

[Chorus]

The music and the harmony, the family and friends
It seems like when your dancin' man, the feelin' never ends
The base of the base, the voice of the drum
The fumble of the keys, my weapon is my tounge
If there's love in the rhythm then the soul is gonna follow
We turnin' up the system, it'll go until tomorrow
If you need some money, I got some that you can borrow
We dance until the sun come up and cast shadows
Right now, the tune reflects, lights out, we soon connect
We ride on lows and high
So hot that we sweat, so happy we cry
Wish bygones goodbye, thank god we's alive
With time on our side and this rhyme I provide
We smile while we slide, do I say goodbye?
We keep it rockin' like the sound of lion

[Chorus]

It's hot, and the police man come
And try to break up the party tonight
uh ha (I say hey now now)
Then I would stand firm wit' you
And would brace ourselves for the fight
All Night, alright I say

Don't tell the DJ got to turn it low
We keep it rockin' til the early morn I say
Hey Now Now, I say hey now now
Don't tell the people that they got to go
I wanna keep em 'til the early morn I say
Hey Now Now, I say hey now now",Hey Now Now
Michael Franti,"Whatever happen to the sun
It seems to always come
Back when we were young
We'd sing and party all night long
The season don't ever come on time no more
War paints over the years
And anger fills our tears
What happen to the sun

But I know, I know, I know I'm not alone
But I know, I know, I know I'm not alone

Every time I read the news
I'm always more confused
Tellin' me to choose
But there's only lies to choose from
And how many died today
How many lost their homes or shot a gun
Or a love one
What happen to our sons

But I know, I know, I know I'm not alone
And I know, I know, I know I'm not alone

I know I'm far away from home but I know I'm not alone
I know I'm far away from home but I know I'm not alone",I Know I'm Not Alone
Michael Franti,"It never makes no sense, it never makes no sense
Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter
Fire fire fire 
Armageddon is a deadly day
Armageddon is a deadly way
They comin' for you everyday
While senators on holiday 

The army recruiters in the parking lot
Hustling the kids there jugglin' pot 
""Listen young man, listen to my plan, 
Gonna make you money, gonna make you a man""

Bom, bom 

Here's what you get
An M-16 and a kevlar vest 
You might come home 
With one less leg
But this thing will surely keep a bullet out of your chest 

So come on, come on 
Sign up, come on 
This one's nothing like Vietnam 
Except for the bullets, except for the bombs
Except for the youth that's gone 

So we keep it on, till ya comin' home

Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter
Fire fire fire
So we keep it on, till ya comin' home

Fire, fire, fire, light up ya lighter

Tell me president, tell if you will
How many people does a smart bomb kill?
How many of em do you think we got?
The general says we never miss a shot 
And we never ever ever keep a body count
We killin' so efficiently we can?t keep count 
In the Afghan hills the rebels still fightin'
Opium fields keep on providin'
The best heroin that money can buy 
And nobody knows where Osama been hidin'
The press conferences keep on lyin'
Like we don't know 

So we keep it on, till ya comin' home

So we keep it on, till ya comin' home

Some say engine, engine number nine
Machine guns on a New York transit line 
The war for oil is a war for the beast
The war on terror is a war on peace 
Tellin' you they?re gonna protect you
Tellin' you that they support the troops 
Don't let them fool you with their milk and honey
No, they only want your money 
One step forward and two step back
One step forward and two step back
Why do veterans get no respect?
PTSD and a broken back
Take a look at where your moneys gone, see
Take a look at what they spend it on 
No excuses, no illusions 
Light up ya lighter, bring em home

So we keep it on, till ya comin' home
Higher and higher

Michael Franti,"I've been down for far too long
'Til my faith was nearly gone
I never knew somebody just like you
Could be a friend I could call my own

When I wake up in the morning, I hope I see you in the light.

I have been traveling down this river, so many rocks pop up in my site.
I've got to make some quick decisions, should I go left or should I go right.
I pray for guidance and protection, it keeps my boat water tight.
But, I know if I just keep on believin', every little thing is gonna be alright.

When I wake up in the morning, I hope I see you in the light.
When I wake up in the morning, I hope I see you in the light.

The vampires gather around me, angling to take a bit.
They want to drink my blood of courage, and try to take away my fight.
But no, no, no, they can't do that, for one truth I've learned in life.
You want to scary away the vampires, you simple guide them into the light.

My heart says follow through
I take one step closer to you

I never meant to hurt you, no
And you never meant to hurt me too
But it seems like you always do

And even though I'm scared sometimes
If ever see you fallen down
I will be the one that's there for you

So I let go of a broken heart
I let go to an open heart
I let go of my broken dreams
I let go to the mystery

And I believe in the miracles
I believe in the spiritual
I believe in the one above
I believe in the one I love

And take one step closer to you
I just take one step closer to you
Even when I've fallen down
My heart says follow through
I take one step closer to you

I'm walking, I keep on walking to you
I keep on walking to you
I'm walking, I keep on walking to you
I'm walking and I'm never going to stop now

I just take one step closer to you
I just take one step closer to you
I take one step closer to you
And it don't stop, I take one step closer to you

I just take one step closer to you
I just take one step closer to you
Even when I've fallen down
My heart says follow through

I'll take one step closer
I'll take two steps closer
Just take one step closer to you
I just take one step closer to you

And even when I've fallen down
My heart says follow through
I take one step closer to you

I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you

I've been a lot of places all around the way
I've seen a lot of joy and I've seen a lot of pain
But I don't want to write a love song for the world
I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl

Junkies on the corner always calling my name
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you getting down, well, I hope it was you
And when I look into your eyes I knew it was true

I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way

I love you, I love you, I love you

But I know when the stars are aligned you can
Bump into a person in the middle of the road
Look into their eyes and you suddenly know

Hey world, you rumble in the jungle tonight
Hey world, keep bringing it the rest of your life
You got to put up a fight.

Hey world, you know you got to put up a fight
Hey world, you rumble in the jungle tonight
Hey world, you're running for the rest of your life
You got to put up a fight.

Boom, boom!

There's a battle going on in this earth
Everyday. Work, school, death, and birth.
There are 6 billion people on this earth,
Can you tell me what every single life is worth?

Toke a spliff, look around and see history.
My weapon and my method is no mystery.
I didn't come here to chill. I came here to rock,
To smash the empire with my boom-box.

You got to let go of remote control!

[Chorus: x2]

You know you got to put up a fight.
On a universal mission like a meteorite.
Satellite, laser beam with you in their sights.
And with the patriot act they took all your right.

Don't ever doubt the power of just one mind.
Or the world-wide power of just one rhyme.
Don't ever doubt the force of the baseline.
Or a record gone round to burn the house down.

(You got to let go of remote control.)

There's a bullet with your name, it's a sign of the times.
It takes nine hundred ninety nine criminal minds.

Some people always try to cheat their death but when it comes you just cant shake it
Some people try to make a deal to get a little bit more but they just can't take it
Some of them end up in debt, when their called they try to fake it

Coz' you never know how long your gunna live till' ya die

Stopped N.Y. time you're in your car
Search your body search your home an' listenin' in on your phone calls
Still no politician got enough balls, lining the people up against the wall
When the truth comes out all hell will call and someday Guantanamo will fall
Until that day we all will ride on

Then radio play the same 10 songs, set your clock by which ones on 
And watching the news try to see whats wrong, find somebody else to blame it on
Hope they never come and research you coz' your grandmother was an immigrant too
So if you love somebody better tell them so 
'Coz you never ever ever no when they gonna go

You've been my heaven sent angel and you make me smile

I know I'm complicated like a spray painted maze
But I hope we can learn to whether or to stay

I know I'm not always easiest to be around
But I try and I try to keep up with your beat
You turn my drum machine on, the way you move your hip

You make me feel alright in the middle of the night
When I'm tossing and turning, you're holding me tight

Michael Franti,"It's been a long time coming that I had to say
When I wake up in the morning all I do is pray
For some guidance and protection on the streets today
And an answer to the questions I ask everyday
So tell me why do the birds that used to fly here
Tell me why do they come to die here
And all the kids that used to run here
Tell me why did they load their guns here
I remember, in the days when,
We were one heart no need to defend
I just wrap my arms around
Don't give up this song is for you

Hey, hey, hey, no matter how life is today
There's just one thing that I got to say
I won't let another moment slip away
I say hey, hey, hey no matter how life is today
There's just one thing that I got to say
I won't let another moment slip away

I hold on, I'm trying to hold on,
I hold on, hold on, hold on

From the tops of the buildings to the streets below
From the Wall Street banks to the empty homes
Between the lines of the people standing all in a row
There's a crack in the gutter where a flower grows
Reminding me that everything is possible
Yeah reminding me that nothing is impossible
You gotta live for the one that you love you know
You gotta love for the life that you live you know

Singin' hey, hey, hey no matter how life is today
There's just one thing that I got to say
I won't let another moment slip away
I say hey, hey, hey no matter how life is today
There's just one thing that I got to say
I won't let another moment slip away

I hold on, I'm trying to hold on,
I hold on, I'm trying to hold on

Until the morning comes again,
I will remain with you my friend
And we will ride until the sun,
Goes to the place where it begun
And we will live to laugh and cry another day

Don't let nobody ever tell you that it couldn't be done
Don't let nobody ever tell you that we couldn't be one
Don't let nobody ever tell you that it shouldn't be sung
Don't let nobody ever tell you you're the only one

Singin' hey, hey, hey no matter how life is today
There's just one thing that I got to say
I won't let another moment slip away
I say hey, hey, hey no matter how life is today
There's just one thing that I got to say
I won't let another moment slip away

Whoa oh oh oh, I hold on
Whoa oh oh oh, I'm just trying to hold on
Whoa oh oh oh, trying to hold on
Whoa oh oh oh, trying to hold on

There's just one thing that I got to say
I won't let another moment slip away
I say hey, hey, hey no matter how life is today
There's just one thing that I got to say
I won't let another moment slip away

They say there may be rain but the sun is hot
I wish I had some time just to kill today
And I wish I had a dime for every bill I've got to pay
Some days you lose you win and the water's as high as the times your in
So I jump back in there where I learned to swim
Try to keep my head above it the best I can, that's why

Here I am,
Just waiting for this storm to pass me by
And that's the sound of sunshine
Coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine
Coming down

One two three, uh huh

I saw my friend Bobby I said ""What's up man""
You got a little work or twenty to lend
I opened up my hand he said ""I'm glad to see
They can take away my job but not my friends, you see""

I wanna go where the summer never ends
With my guitar on the beach there with all my friends
The suns so hot and the waves in motion
And everything smells like sun tan lotion
The ocean, and the girls so sweet
So kick off your shoes and relax your feet
They say that miracles are never seizing
And every single soul needs a little releasing

And I only wanna hear that sound

And that's the sound of sunshine (of sunshine)
Coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine
Coming down

And I said you're the one I wanna be with (yo yo)
When the sun goes down (uh huh)

When the sun goes down, singin' you're the one I wanna be with

That's why so many people stand up and say

One child and all of them singin.

still just one moment, six billion people and all of them singing.

Got diseases excited, they crawled up inside us.

Then you take you higher, higher, higher, higher

Some say it's left hand, some say it ain't. 
The best newspaper is a can of spraypaint. 
Pick up a chainsaw filled with desire, chop down a tree, set them on fire. 
Some transform and they call them a liar. 
The worlds all black from a stack of burning tires. 
Some say it's over, some say it's on, 
some hold to their children and still walk on sayin

Do it for the love of it, do it for the smell of it
Do it for the joy and the taste and the hell of it
Do it ‚Äòcause you love it and it makes no sense
Not yens or euros or dollars or cents

When I was a little, little boy I knew I‚Äôd grow up
To be somebody that my mama said would always show up
To work, to school and all that‚Äôs cool
But, following rules was never my strong suit, you know
I bought a guitar, a microphone too
Set out to do what I was born to do
And mama said something as I was walking out the door

[Chorus]
Do it for the love, not for the money
Not for the guns and not for the honeys
Do it ‚Äòcause it makes you feel alive
Like the way we rockin‚Äô on Saturday night
Do it for the love of it, do it for the smell of it
Do it for the joy and the taste and the hell of it
Do it ‚Äòcause you love it and it makes no sense
Not yens or euros or dollars or cents

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Do it for the love of it
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Just for the love of it

Life is never easy and you better know it
Sometimes it‚Äôs like the date you‚Äôre waiting for that doesn‚Äôt show up
You got to pay the rent, or else you owe it
And like a credit card, you know you better not blow it
And if you got beef with someone, let go it
And if you got love for someone, you better show it
Mama said this as I was walking out the door

[Chorus]

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Do it for the love of it
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Just for the love of it

[Chorus]

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
In the summertime
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
That‚Äôs right, that‚Äôs right, so party people say
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Put your hands in the air like this, y‚Äôall
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Do it for the love of it
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Do it for the love of it
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Just for the love of it
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Do it for the love of it
Just for the love of it",Do It For the Love

Would I see ladies in the beauty parlor doin hair, 
and teenage soldiers with their guns up in the air? 
Would I see a hit list of the species that are gone, 
or would I be a witness to the world droppin bombs? 
Would I see the rain for amazon where the whole world sing one song?

that I love and they excuse is they just human. 
And I've been learning how to breathe, learnin how to see. 
Heart in the clouds, but don't know how to dream. 
Evidently, your grass is green. I wish I had a personality.

I like to see your planet, every flower be bloomin. 
I like to see your planet so the clouds refuelin. 
I like to see your planet, every human stay human. 
I don't know, but I know just one thing's for sure. 
If I saw this, I'd still come back for more.

Dreaming of places we would never ever get to see
Like Indonesia or Zanzabar
But every night we'd end up at a local bar
Somebody told me don't stare at horizons
Unless you are ready to run
So let's save our money and buy a car
So we can we can drive all the way across America
One day closer till my number comes
We gonna keep on burnin' till the night is gone
It's a long ride home
It's a long ride home
It's a long ride home
We drove down the Mississippi past a bus of hippies
Drinking 40s and rolling up some sticky icky
Under the stars or maybe even Mars
Muscle cars are smoking up the boulevard
You look pretty out of the city
You said you love me and there's no place you wanna go alone
One day closer till my number comes
We gonna keep on burnin' till the night is gone

Just a little more time for me
Just a little more time that we could be together
We go on and on, and on and on [x2]
We leave it behind but we‚Äôre still moving on and on

I remember when we use to play hopscotch out on the sidewalk
I would draw your picture there with my white chalk
Every day we‚Äôd ride bikes home through the schoolyard
We would eat, sleep, work just so we could play hard
Tired of calling mom saying ‚Äúplease come get me‚Äù
Traded in my bike for a beat up Chevy
Pops was home drinkin‚Äô
I was home dreamin‚Äô
And the years fly by like, boom!

I remember rolling in my ride to the White Stripes concert
Climbing in the back seat
Rolling up your short skirt
Steamed up windows
Then we graduated
Said good-bye to the town that we hated
Life gets harder every single day
And when you fall down, that‚Äôs the rent that you pay
We used to say forever
Now we say remember
Look at all the bad and good we‚Äôve seen together
I‚Äôm sorry that I lost you
Happy that I had you

Don't need to run so fast
Sometimes we come last but we did our best

I won't give up, no I won't give in
Till I reach the end
And then I'll start again
Though I'm on the lead
I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail
I won't give up, no I won't give in
Till I reach the end
And then I'll start again
No I won't leave
I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail

I'll keep on making those new mistakes
I'll keep on making them every day
Those new mistakes

Our experience will blend us in your sight Our
Experience will blend us in with the stars No
We'll never know how unreal we are And when the
Cool light flows and 10 million sleep Our
Experience will blend in with your sightless
Dreams,

Through telepathy we'll shoot

Through the sky And we'll shine like steel in a
Clear white fire We'll taste your honey mouth and
Kiss your eyes like mirrors And fill your body up
With 10 million tears Our experience is shiffing, 
Your body's made of clear light We'll blend in
With your image - a picture draamed by the
Blind,

Michael Gott,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon
Michael Gott,"Why know what,
It's time, for you to surrender your love

It's not about what ya want to know
The time is right that's for sure
It seems so silly but you complete me
Your hanging back just to see
Is another girl better than me
Looks so pretty she's the kind I lead

[Bridge 1]
What is it you're looking for
I give you all you want and more
It's not tricky it's what it is what it is

Surrender your love baby
Surrender your love

Shy away from the deal
Ya sitting by something so real
You think your clever
But the other side is better

I give you all you want and more
Never felt like this before
Is what it is what it is

Don't want you to let yourself go
There's so much more for you to know
Surrender won't surrender won't no no no
It's time for you to see just what I'm worth

Surrender won't surrender won't no no no

Cause I can't hide what is on my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin
What did I do to be so black and blue?
Tell me, what did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do? Tell me, what did I do to be so black and blue?

Michael Holm,"Dies ist die Geschichte von El Lute.
Ein Mann
Der geboren wurde
Um wie ein wildes Tier gejagt zu werden
Weil er arm war und sich nicht wehren konnte
Aber er gab sich mit seinem Schicksal nicht zufrieden
Und heute wurde seine Ehre wieder hergestellt..
Er war 19 und arm und verurteilt zum Tod
Dabei wu√üten alle
Der Schuldige war nicht El Lute.
Man begnadigte ihn
Er bekam lebenslang
Er tr√§umte von Flucht und lie√ü nichts unversucht
Bis er schlie√ülich entkam
Damit fing die Jagd an - nach El Lute.
Er hat nie das Licht der Sonne gesehn
Sie nannten ihn El Lute.
Was er wollte
War nur ein Zuhaus und mehr Brot
Und ein Ende von Hunger und Not.
Aber Spanien war damals kein Land
F√ºr einen wie El Lute
Doch weil er f√ºr das Recht aller Rechtlosen stand
Waren sie f√ºr El Lute.
Und es sprach sich herum
Da√ü es nicht um El Lute nur ging.
Hier war einer wie sie
Und er beugte sich nie
Ihre Hoffnung
Sie stieg
Denn sein Sieg war ihr Sieg
Denn sein Sieg war ihr Sieg.
Auf und ab durch das Land ging die endlose Jagd
Wo immer er war
√ºberall hing das Bild von El Lute.
Er war wie Robin Hood
Und es ging lange gut
Dann schlo√ü sich die Falle
Das Ende schien nah
Doch ein Wunder geschah -
In dem sonnigen Land - von El Lute.
Er hat nie das Licht der Sonne gesehn
Sie nannten ihn El Lute.
Was er wollte
War nur ein Zuhaus und mehr Brot
Und ein Ende von Hunger und Not
Und es kam ein neuer Morgen ins Land
Er kam auch f√ºr El Lute
Denn die Feiheit
Die dort f√ºr die Menschen heut gilt
Sie gilt auch f√ºr El Lute.
Er hat nie das Licht der Sonne gesehn
Sie nannten ihn El Lute.

War nur ein Zuhaus und mehr Brot

Michael J. Weiss,"Lucky to be here with you now
Having come so far each step it feels like miles
So much to learn along the way
Though at times I fell I would not change a thing
Watch as the time goes by so fast
Getting older now but the hard times they have past

Come and take a walk with me
Just to see what we can see
Come and take a walk with me
I want to wander, just to wander, let our feet just set us free
I want to wander, just to wander, let our feet just set us free

Hitch a ride on the northern breeze
Float through the day and then just hang all night with me
Got nowhere to go no place to be
Forget all our plans and know that what will be will be
Can't seem to hang onto the night
I know those memories stay I couldn't shake them if I tried

Come and take a walk with me
Just to see what we can see
Come and take a walk with me
I want to wander, just to wander, let our feet just set us free
I want to wander, just to wander, let our feet just set us free

This night looks like any night
This night feels like any night

Watch as the time goes by so fast
Getting older now but the good times always last

I want to wander, just to wander, let our feet just set us free
I want to wander, just to wander, let our feet just set us free
I want to wander, come on and wander, wander with me and set us free
Just set us free

Michael Jackson,"Nation to nation, all the world must come together,
Face the problems that we see,
Then maybe somehow we can work it out.
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said, later.
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be.
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears,
But we must live each day like it's the last.
Go with it, go with it.

Jam. It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,
It ain't too much, it ain't too much for me to jam.
It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,
It ain't, don't you, it ain't too much for me to

The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts,
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out.
I told my brother, don't you ask me for no favors,
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout.
She pray to God to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song.
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me, I'm the temple,
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself.
Go with it, go with it.

Jam. It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,
It ain't too much, it ain't too much for me to jam.
It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,
It ain't, don't you, it ain't too much for me to

Uh, huh, it ain't too much stuff, it ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to jam.
It ain't, it ain't too much stuff, it ain't, don't you,
It ain't too much for me to

Jam, jam, here comes the man, hot damn,
The big boy stands, movin' up a hand.
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson,
Smooth criminal, that's the man, Mike's so relaxed.
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle, bum rushed to door 3 and 4's in a bundle.
Execute the plan, first I cooled like a fan,
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael 'cause it ain't hard to

Jam. It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,
It ain't too much, it ain't too much for me to jam.
It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,

Michael Jackson,"She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

So I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late

She's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life",She's Out of My Life
Michael Jackson,"It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking
In the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops
Your heart
You try to scream, but terror takes the sound before
You make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between
The eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to
Strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight

You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere
Left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see
The sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just
Imagination
But all the while you hear the creature creepin' up
Behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with
Forty eyes
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life

They're out to get you; there's demons closing in on
Every side
They will possess you unless you change the number on
Your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close
Together
All through the night I'll save you from the terrors on
The screen
I'll make you see

That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost
Would ever dare try
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller
Chiller
Thriller here tonight

That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost
Would ever dare try
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller",Thriller

Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do it that way
If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way

Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way

I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way

(That way) Why why
(That way) Why why

Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say,
Why, why, ooo tell 'em
Why, why does he do me that way

Michael Jackson,"She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing

I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd

I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.

I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories.

I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.

Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear her crying here
And I can hear her calling me.

Don't you know?

Wishing on stars
Waiting for you to find me

One sweet night
I knew I would see
A stranger who'd be my friend

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
When somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Like it was written in the stars, I knew
My friend, my someone in the dark, was you

""Thank you.""

Promise me
We'll always be
Walking the world together

Hand in hand
Where dreams never end
My star secret friend and me

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
When somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky

Oh, I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye

Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay

And you got your life to live

Taking you away from here
But if ever think that has to be

We'll be there to share each lonely road

In this almighty cage 
We shop through the yellow page 
Gone is the corner store 
There is a supermarket there for you 

But feelings remain the same 

And it's too late, too late to change the time 
Well it's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late to change your mind (too late) 

It's a new day, a new age 
A photograph is taken, its ready one minute later 
Cars are bigger and better 
Manufacture satisfy
Any world full of crime 
I can't let you take

And it's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late to change your mind (too late) 
No, no 

So you want to be a star 
I think you are 
You don't have to go further 
Then my loving arms 

And it's too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind 

Are you sure you want to go to New York City (New York City) 
Where girls make it big if their pretty (if their pretty) 
Let say you get that penthouse view 
But whose gonna love you the way I do (just the way I do) 

It's too late, too late to change the time 
And it's too late, too late to change the time 
No, too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind 
Yea, yea, yea 

And it's too late, too late to change the time 
It's too late, too late to change the time 
Ooh, too late, too late to change the time 
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind 
Yea, yea, yea

Michael Jackson,"Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tenderness I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the loneliness that was waiting there
You closed the door of your heart and turned the key
Locked your love away from me

Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You said loving you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked just one way
You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then took my hope, look at me now

Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
And you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep
My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh my darling, now you're gone",Love Is Here and Now You're Gone
Michael Jackson,"Ah I feel a fountain in my brain
Ice-cold water runnin' through my pain
Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart so sad 'cause love's gone bad

I see a rainbow all in black
Must be a sign that you ain't comin' back
Wake up at night callin' your name
I see a face on my window pane

I've been this way since you've been gone
Without your love I can't go on
Look in the mirror, what do I see? 
A cryin' face, kinda looks like me
Now where's the love you promised me? 
Where's he tenderness to comfort me? 

Everytime some love I choose
I seem to always be the one to lose
Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart fells sad 'cause love's gone bad
Love's gone bad, heart fells bad

Black crows flying up above
It's a sign that I live life without love
Slime's on the man, slime's ont the sea
Slime's everywhere I said I'm destined to be

And this world where nothing's right
Since you've been gone I can't sleep at night
You said you'd be true to me
Instead you made a fool out of me
Heart feels sad, love's gone bad",Love's Gone Bad

Even though the pain and heartache
Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show,

And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now
Never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right through the core
It says, turn around, you fool
You know you love him more and more
Tell me why is it so

Don't wanna let you go

Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
There's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same old dizzy hangup
Can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go

Avoiding ships of fools

If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart

I've done all to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me, myself
So he can do or else

For without compromise, shall flower the fruit of constant care

In my eleventh hour, I'll be a man when
To face whatever falls my way
Prepare that utter shame
To just be called a part of God
For which I have been named

A man and woman's youngest son
While growing, still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile

Proud

Michael Jackson,"You're givin' me true love
And everyday I thank the Lord
For a feeling that's so new
So inviting so exciting

Whenever your near, I hear a symphony
A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms
Then suddenly your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine, still I need a path because
I'm lost in a world made for you and me

Baby, baby
I hear a symphony, baby
Whenever your near, I hear a symphony
Played sweet and tenderly
Every time your lips meet mine, my baby

Baby, baby
I feel the joy begin
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on now, baby

Baby, baby
Those tears that filled my eyes
I cried not for myself
But for those who have never felt the joy of love

Baby, baby
Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
Each time you speak of me
I hear a tender note so sweet of love

Baby, baby
As you stand there holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air, now

Baby, baby
Don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
So close to me my baby, baby, baby

Michael Jackson,"I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I was high-top shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then

You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know, I was made to love her
Built a world all around her""
Yeah, hey, hey, hey

She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet Magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years

I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey

All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, ah
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere

I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side, I'll still be standing there

'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah
Ah, I was made to love her
Built my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey

Ooh baby, I was made to please her
You know, Stevie ain't gonna leave her, no
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, wee, baby, my baby loves me
My baby needs me

There you are, I walk alone

Here I am so all alone
And I am so sad and lonely
Tell me what will I do
I can't explain, I'm all alone
You used to love me
I feel I'm your blue

They told me you should sing a song
And happy with your feelin' blue
I'm singing for so very long
Still crying, tell me what should I do.

All I know is

Michael Jackson,"I took my baby on a river boat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited about the way things could have been
Cause in it I don't care
I want a face no one can recognize, in disguise
Someone called out my name
They thought of taking pictures, autographs, then they grab
My joy has turned to pain

Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reaching for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win
I'm down in my pain, don't you feel it?
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't be feelin' no pain! 
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame
So don't you ever complain! 

I'm on, the cover of the magazine, what a scene
They know my every do's
""Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine"" ? 
That always bothers me
Get in your car, you wanna take a ride, look behind
Someone is following you
You try to get away you turn real fast, but too bad
They know your every move! 

My father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reaching for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win
I bleed all this pain, don't you ever complain! 

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain! 
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' no pain! 

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame! 
Father never lies, my father never lies
My father never lies
So don't be feelin' this way boy! 

I'd like to take some time and get away, then they'll say
Is that boy still alive?
The week in village what a thrill
Only the strong survive

My father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
They startin' to wonderin' where have you been?
I feel their envious looks at me
Their mistaken jealousy
Then stand here in my shoes
And then get a taste of my blues! 

It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame, so don't you ever complain! 
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
So don't be feelin' this way! 
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame, so don't you ever complain! 

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame! 
Father never lies, my father never lies baby
My father never lies
So don't be feelin' no pain boy!",Price of Fame

And I can hear that doggone thing

And hold her in my arms one more time
And when I kiss her lips
I turn backward flip

Time and shame
I think the whole world

I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do

Michael Jackson,"The way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different
About this girl

The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust

The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was
Walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't
Talk on the phone
My baby cried
She left me standing alone

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point
Of no return

Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew
But I was living in vain
She called my house
She said you know my name
And don't you pretend
You never did me before
With tears in her eyes
My baby walked out the door

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine

I can not sleep alone tonight
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation
You hurt my baby

And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of
A strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was
Smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words
Were as sharp as
A two-edged sword
But I loved it
'Cause it's dangerous

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon

Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon

Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night

Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon

Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon

Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon

Born to amuse, to inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night

Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon

Gone too soon",Gone Too Soon

Michael Jackson,"There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make it a better place
For you and for me

If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear of dread
We stop existing and start living

The it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be god's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living",Heal the World

Too young to really be in love

They say that love's a word
A word we've only heard

And then someday they may recall
We were not to young at fall",Too Young

Of laughter and tears
With rain and with sunshine
Love will grow through the years

Have time to come true
And forever is meant for so very few

We shall have music
We shall have rhyme
We shall have each other
One minute after the end of time

Then we'll add up the pleasure
And treasure the sums
Caring is sharing
A cake and the crumbs

How lucky we are to be me and you
And forever is meant for so very few",We've Got Forever

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice, don't think twice)

Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)

Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine

I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

Because she's mine

Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

I love you more than he
(take you anywhere)

But I love you endlessly
(loving we will share)

So come and go with me
To one town

But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever

I don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time

I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time

She's mine, she's mine

Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter
I've heard it all before, Michael, she told me that I'm her forever lover,

Michael Jackson,"Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon

A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care,
Oh the blood in her hair

Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain

But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair

It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there

She knew no one cared

Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers

Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh it will

She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

And a washed-out dream

Of greed and lust

They don't care

Read the holy word
In the scheme of life
It's all absurd

Now you're wearing a badge

If you tell me to cry

If you give me a hand

Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away

That you are not alone
For I am here with you

Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Michael Jackson,"There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a goul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming down the stairs

Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere

I'm gonna be
Exactly what you want to see
It's you who's haunting me
You're warning me
To be the stranger
In your life

Am I amusing you
Or just confusing you
Am I the beast
You visualized
And if you want to see
Eccentrialities
I'll be grotesque
Before your eyes

Let them all materialize
Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, oh
Is it scary for you, baby
Is it scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby

There's a creak beneath the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where restless soul's spoke

I'm gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes

A haunting ghostly treat
The foolish trickery
And spirits dancing
In the light

But if you came to see
The truth the purity
It's here inside
A lonely heart

So let the performance start
Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, oh
Am I scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you
So tell me is it scary for you, baby
So tell me is it crazy for you, baby
Am I scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for ya

Masquerade the heart
Is the height of haunting souls
Just not what you seek of me
Can the heart reveal the proof
Like a mirror reveals the truth
See the evil one is you

Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, oh
Am I scary for you, baby
Is it scary for you
So tell me am I scary for you, baby
Am I scary for ya, baby
Is is scary for ya, baby
Am I scary for you

Am I scary for you

It seems like only yesterday
You gave your love to me
And we made a vow that through the years
Our love would always be.
Whenever doubts would fill my mind
You'd brush my fears away
Look into my eyes and hold me close
And this is what you'd say

We've got blue skies, now can't you see?
There'll never ever be another love for me.

The pleasant dreams we shared
Made our love stronger with each day
And the fears that haunted me
Seemed like a million miles away.
When friends we knew would come to me
With lies about your love
I'd tell them happiness and sunny skies
Are all we're thinking of
We're so in love
We're thinking of.

Blue skies
Blue skies

I see you there, you're kissing him
How can this really be?
Well, I guess it's time to realize
My dreams are more to me
And as I walk off thinking
What a fool I must have been
Like an echo from my lips today
I hear you telling him

We've got blue skies, now can't you see?
There'll never ever be another love for me.
We've got blue skies, now can't you see?

The day I find you, girl, you'll love me

When you're in my arms you'll want to keep for me

I know I'll get you

True love can be beautiful but it takes time
True love can be beautiful but it takes time

You're here in my arms
Where you'll stay today

Michael Jackson,"This is not your ordinary record

Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things
Kids are murderin' other kids for the fun of it
Instead of using their mind or their fist they put a gun in it
want to be a part of a clique, don't know who's runnin' it
Tragedy on top of tragedy, you know it's killing me

So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty
There has to be some type of change for this day and age
We gotta rearrange and flip the page
Living encaged like animals and cannibals
Eatin' each other alive just to survive the nine to five
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive
And peace of mind is hard to find

Come on, now

Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces
A war is taking place, no substitution for restitution
The only solution for peace is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion
How we're livin'
The clock is tickin', the end is comin', there'll be no warning
But we live to see the dawn

How can we preach
When all we make this world to be
Is a living hell torturing our minds
We all must unite
To turn darkness to light
And the love in our hearts will shine

We're disconnected from love
We're disrespecting each other
What happened to protecting each other
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever
Babies being born in the world
Already drug addicted and afflicted
Family values are contradicted
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The pressure's building and I've had enough

Somebody's missing a friend, hold on
Somebody's lacking a hero
And they have not a clue
When it's all gonna end

Stories buried and untold
Someone is hiding the truth, hold on
When will this mystery unfold
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?

You change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

People laugh when they're feelin sad
Someone is taking a life, hold on
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tell me where were you
when your children cried last night?

Faces fill with madness
Miracles unheard of, hold on
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is reach for the truth, the truth

You change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

And when that flag blows
There'll be no more wars
And when all calls
I will answer all your prayers

You change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)

See I just can't find the right thing to say
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Tell me what I have to do so you'll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray

And how can I stop losing you
How can I begin to say
When there's nothing left to do but walk away

I close my eyes
Just to try and see you smile one more time
But it's been so long now all I do is cry
Can't we find some love to take this away
Cause the pain gets stronger every day

How can I begin again
How am I to understand
When there's nothing left to do but walk away

See now why
All my dreams been broken
I don't know where we're going
Everything we said and all we done now
Don't let go, I don't want to walk away
Now why
All my dreams are broken
Don't know where we're going
Everything begins to set us free
Can't you see, I don't want to walk away

Only for me, then spoke with her body 
Her only goal is just to take control 
And I can't believe that I can't tell her no 

That girl I can't take her 
Should have known she was a heartbreaker

Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
Should have seen right thriough her 
She's a heartbreaker 

She plays a game with such an innocent face 
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case 
Her actions confess and put me through the test 
I was surprised that I was caught inside 
Now she's thinking that I will never know 
Ans she'll keep playing until I let her go 
But I hope in time that she will finally realize 
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same

Stop being without you 
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you 
And start being without you 
But I'll find a way to go and start doin' without you 
And stop talkin' about you 
And what will she say? 
She will say I was the man that got away

Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it's incredible
And I don't know hat I'd do, if I can't be with you

If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't want to go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close

Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were

When all I do is for you but still you say it ain't cool

If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me

But I can do anything, she's invincible

Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream

If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me

You keep on stalking me, invading my privacy
Won't you just let me be
Cause you cameras can't control, the minds of those who know
That you'll even sell your soul just to get a story sold

Some of you still wonder why, one of my friends had to die
To get a message across, that yet you haven't heard

But on that cold winter night, my pride was snatched away

Now she get no second chance, she just ridiculed and harassed
Please tell my why
No there's a lesson to learn, respect's not given, it's earned
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity

Michael Jackson,"Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel
But I am speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray
Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
I'll go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face
There's no mountain high I cannot climb
I'm humbled in your grace
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence I am lost for words
Words like, ""I love you.""",Speechless

Tonight's story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introducing
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh yes, I did forget something didn't I? I forgot to introduce you to the monster.

You're fearing me, 'cause you know I'm a beast
Watching you when you sleep, when you're in bed
I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall, and when you scream it's √¢??cause of me
I'm the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head
I know just what you said
That's why you've got to be threatened by me

[Chorus]
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you
In one blink I'll disappear, and then I'll come back to haunt you
I'm telling you, when you lie under a tomb
I'm the one watching you
That's why you got to be threatened by me

[Chorus]

The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case 
Never Neverland, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in tow places at the same time
This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear.

[Chorus: x3]

What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare.
It isn't. It's the beginning.",Threatened
Michael Jackson,"Now I'm just wondering why you think
That you can get to me with anything
Seems like you'd know by now
When and how I get down
And with all that I've been through,
I'm still around

Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby I've got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get to me
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me
'cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable

Now you can't stop me even thought you think
That if you block me, you've done your thing
And when you bury me underneath all your pain
I√Ç¬¥m steady laughin', while surfacing

Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby I've got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get to me
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me

Michael Jackson,"Once all alone
I was lost in a world of strangers
No one to trust
On my own, I was lonely
You suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before but now it's clear
You took away the fear
You brought me back to life

You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You're my life

Now I wake up everyday
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
'Cause you love me
You help me understand
That love is the answer to all that I am
And I'm a better man
You taught me by sharing your live

You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You're my life

You gave me strength
When I wasn't strong
You gave me hope when all hope is lost
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see

Here comes the rain
And heartache things
What can I do but wait for you
Darling the days
I had looked cold

Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you got your life to live
But if it gets too rough
Call on me

Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever think that has to be
Turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need
If you can't get enough
Call on me

I'm so sad you're leaving
It's going to kill me
Not to be with you? 
But I want you to be happy
If parting is what you want
Then I want it too
So goodbye with all my best
For your happiness in a world that's there
Should you write and it's not there
Call on me

Yes, happiness
Wish you for elsewhere

Ben, you're always running here and there,
You feel you're not wanted anywhere.

There's something you should know, you've got a place to go.

Who promise fortune and fame

But I hate sleppin' alone
Why don't you come with me
I said my baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to
Say that I'm alright

Diana walked up to me,
She said I'm all yours tonight
At that I ran to the phone
Sayin' baby I'm alright
I said but unlock the door.
Because I forgot the key.

You make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between
The eyes
You're paralyzed

Strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night

Left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see
The sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just
Imagination
But all the while you hear the creature creepin' up
Behind
You're out of time

There ain't no second chance against the thing with
Forty eyes
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life

They're out to get you; there's demons closing in on
Every side
They will possess you unless you change the number on
Your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close
Together
All through the night I'll save you from the terrors on
The screen
I'll make you see

That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost 
Would ever dare try
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller
Chiller
Thriller here tonight

That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost 
Would ever dare try
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist

Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing

I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine

She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd

Who left my heart in pieces

To a circus girl
Who ran away.

I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories.

I lost my heart

To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart

In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me.

And left ourselves a mountain to be overcome

And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow

And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make it a better place
For you and for me

If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving

If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear od dread
We stop existing and start living

The it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life

Wound this earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be god's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Michael Jackson,"Sadness had been close as my next of kin
Then happy came one day, chased my blues away
My life began when happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was

Happy, that's you
You made my life brand new
Lost as a little lam was I till you came in
My life began when happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was
(Till now)

Where have I been?
What lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently

Let happy be where sadness was till now","Happy (Love Theme from ""Lady Sings the Blues"")"

And I took her for granted I was so cavalier

And I've learned that love won't wait

We made our vows
We'd live a life anew

Michael Jackson,"She Was More Like A Beauty Queen From A Movie Scene
I Said Don't Mind, But What Do You Mean I Am The One
Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round
She Said I Am The One Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round

She Told Me Her Name Was Billie Jean, As She Caused A Scene
Then Every Head Turned With Eyes That Dreamed Of Being The One
Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round

People Always Told Me Be Careful Of What You Do
And Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts
And Mother Always Told Me Be Careful Of Who You Love
And Be Careful Of What You Do 'Cause The Lie Becomes The Truth

Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One
But The Kid Is Not My Son
She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son

For Forty Days And for Forty Nights
The Law was on her Side
But Who Can Stand When She's In Demand
Her Schemes And Plans
'Cause We Danced On The Floor In The Round
So Take My Strong Advice, Just Remember To Always Think Twice
Do think Twice

She Told My Baby We'd Danced 'Til Three
Then She Looked At Me
She Showed A Photo Of A Baby Crying
His Eyes Looked Like Mine
Go On Dance On The Floor In The Round, Baby

People Always Told Me Be Careful Of What You Do
And Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts
She Came And Stood Right By Me
Then The Smell Of Sweet Perfume
This Happened Much Too Soon
She Called Me To Her Room

Boy is that girl with you 
Yes we're one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none

And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business

I ain't scared of your brother
I ain'ts scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl when the goin' gets mean

Protection 
For gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places
Faces
Where your blood comes from
Is were your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make it a better place
For you and for me

If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear of dread
We stop existing and start living

The it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be god's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying 
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Michael Jackson,"My baby's always dancin' and it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no lovin' and that's no lie
We spent the night in Frisco at every kinda disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

That nasty boogie bugs me, but somehow how it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I've changed my life completely, I've seen the lightning leave me
And my baby just can't take her eyes off me

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie, woo

I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet

I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet

Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

This magic music grooves me, that dirty rhythm fools me
The Devil's gotten to me through this dance
I'm full of funky fever, a fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a super trance

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times

Michael Jackson,"Love was taken from a young life
And no one told her why
Her direction has a dim light 
From one more violent crime 
She innocently questioned why
Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue 
How is it that you get to choose
Who will live and who will die 
Did god say that you you could decide ?
You saw he didn't run 
And then my daddy had no gun
In the middle of a village 
Within a distant land
Lies a cool boy with his broken toy 
Too young to understand
He's awaken, ground is shaking 
His father grabs his hand
Screaming crying, his wife's dying
Now he's left to explain
He innocently questioned why 
Why his mother had to die
Why did these soldiers come here for ? 
If they're for peace why is there war ? 
Did god say that they could decide 
Who will live and who will die ?
All my mama ever did 
Was try to take care of her kids
When innocence is standing by 
Watching people loosing lives
It seem as if we have no voice 
It's time for us to make a choice
Only god could decide 
Who will live and who will die
There's nothing that can't be done 
If we raise our voice as one
They've gotta hear it from me 
They've gotta hear it from you 
They've gotta hear it from us 
We can't take it
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me 
They've gotta hear it from you 
They've gotta hear it from us 
We can't take it
We've already had enough
Thank god I care for me
Thank god I care for you
Thank god I came from you babe
We can't take it
We've already had enough
Deep in my soul baby
Deep in your soul and by your side
Deep in my soul
It's so big and I'm still alive
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
It's going down baby
Just let god decide, 
It's going on baby
Just let god decide
Deep in my soul baby
We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from you 
They've gotta it from us

Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend

Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

When weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?

But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused will you show to me
You'll be there for me

Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream, but terror takes the sound before you make it

You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller at night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller, tonight

You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination
But all the while you hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller at night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life

They're out to get you; there's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul
Would ever dare try

Girl so let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
I'm gonna thrill ya tonight

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist

A capricious anomaly in the sea of space

Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid

Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart soft and blue
Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul.

In my veins I've felt the mystery
Of corridors of time, books of history
Life songs of ages throbbing in my blood
Have danced the rhythm of the tide and flood

Your misty clouds, your electric storm
Were turbulent tempests in my own form
I've licked the salt, the bitter, the sweet
Of every encounter, of passion, of heat
Your riotous color, your fragrance, your taste

Have thrilled my senses beyond all haste
In your beauty, I've known the how
Of timeless bliss, this moment of now

Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void

Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul.

And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

And I've learned that love don't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late

He touched you and it stabs

All along I knew you were
A phony girl
You sit behind the mask
And you control your world

You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth but that's your hiding place
You say you love me but its hard to see
Cause when he's in your arms,
Your throwing rocks at me
Who do you love?
Is it me?
Well, I don't know
Who do you love?

I walk around I'm sufferin'
In my doom
When I come to you,
You're sittin' in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask
So I can see your face
Who do you love?

Is it me?
Well, I don't know

I am the moonlight
You are the spring, ours life's a sacred thing

I am the one who came when you feel down

I was the only one around, (the only one)
When things were hurting you
I am forever

Wasn't it I who someday you are free
Wonder if it seems so hard to be,
And things would hurt you

I am forever, I am forever
We are forever, we are forever
I am your friend, through thick and thin
We need each other,
We'll never part,
Our love is from the heart

We never say I don't need you,
We are forever

I am the one who someday you are free
Wonder if it seems so hard to be, (the only one)
And nothing would cheer you

I am forever,
Wasn't it I who carried you around
When all the words keep turning down
When things would hurt you

I am forever, I am forever
We are forever, we are forever

You are the sun that lights summer sky,
When things are shaded
Let go and then we do get back,
I was the only one around
When things would hurt you

We are forever, I am forever,
We are forever, I am forever

In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the Childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
Look within your heart then ask,
Have you seen my Childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things,
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the Childhood I've never known

Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

Michael Jackson,"Live and sin 
Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearning 
I promised I would never ever be returning 
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning 
 
As we walked into the room, there were faces 
Staring, glaring, tearing through me 
Someone said welcome to your doom 
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me 
This is scaring me 
 
We walked up the stairs still concealing gloom 
There were two girls sitting in My room 
She walked up to my face 
And said this is the place 
You said meet you right here at noon 
 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
 
Hope is dead 
She thought that I had cheated for another lover 
I turn my back to see that I am undercover 
Now I can`t convince this girl there ain`t no other 
 
Someone`s evil to hurt my soul 
Every smile`s trial thought in beguile 
To hurt me 
Then the man next door had told 
He`s been here in tears for fifteen years 
This is scaring me 
 
We came to this place, where the vicious dwell 
And found that wicked women run this strange hotel 
There was Sefra and Sue, 
Every girl that I knew 
And my baby said love is through 
 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel

Michael Jackson,"Love Is Here, 
And, oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
Love Is Here, 
And, oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
You persuaded me to love you,
And I did, 
But instead of tenderness I found heartache instead,
Into your arms I fell, 
So unaware of the loneliness that was waiting there.
Spoken:  You closed the door of your heart and turned the key,
locked your love away from me.
 
Love Is Here, 
And, oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
You made me love you, 
And oh my darling, Now You're Gone,
You said loving you would make life beautiful 
with each passing day,
But as soon as love came into my heart, 
you turned and you walked just one way.
Spoken:  You stripped me of my dreams, 
you gave me faith, then took my hope, look at me now.
 
Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
And you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep.
Spoken:  My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there
 

",Love Is Here and Now You Are Gone
Michael Jackson,"No matter how hard

Father runs to the table, he says ""What's going on?""
Mother cries desperately, ""Our little baby's gone!""

She wrote that she is tired of step daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive?
She ain't got nothing to eat!

Save me (cause I don't wanna know)

Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waiting there
""I'll show you where the money is, girl just let down your hair""
He's taking her on the streets, of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hard, girl that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there they told
He's arresting this little girl, that's only twelve years old!

You promised me too soon, 'cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of you 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish, and then we'll kiss, a love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

It seems you don't know we reached the heightened mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together, we will fly, we'll dance up in the heaven
I can really feel it when you're near

And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed

Michael Jackson,"As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out
And looked down and noticed I got a flat

So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling like a mist

I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there

Oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

As she took me right through the fog
I see a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and smiling and
Nothing to fear fear

She said this is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness
She turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin'
She grabbed my hand, you got a friend

Oh
Take me to a place without no name
Yeah

She started likin' me kissin' me and huggin' me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen things I've never done
This really looks like a lotta fun

I seen the grass and the sky and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world could I wanna leave

So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world

Raised her kids the very best she can (Holding her to blame)

Said at home she didn‚Äôt have no phone (Holding her to blame)

To spend the night was the goal she played (Holding her to blame)

Michael Jackson,"Father comes home from work, and he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he says what's going on?
Mother cries desperately, our little baby's gone!

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

She wrote that she is tired of step daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive?
She ain't got nothing to eat!

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Save me (from this living hell)
Save me ('cause I don't wanna know)
Save me ('cause I'm tired and unfed)
Save me ('cause his because of you )
Save me (I'm on the bed)
Save me ('cause I don't want no more)
Save me (from this living hell)
Save me ('cause terror arrived )
Save me

Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waiting there
I'll show you where the money is, girl just let down your hair
He's taking her on the streets, of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hard, girl that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there they told
He's arresting this little girl, that's only twelve years old

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

You promised me too soon, 'cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home instead

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of you 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish, and then we'll kiss, a love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

It seems you don't know we reached the heightened mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together, we will fly, we'll dance up in the heaven
I can really feel it when you're near

Michael Jackson,"As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out
And looked down and noticed I got a flat

So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling like a mist

I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there

Woah oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and smiling and
There's no in fear

She said this is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness
She turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin'
Grabbed my hand, you got a friend

Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name (no name)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

She started likin' me kissin' me and huggin' me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen and things I've never done
This place really looks like a lotta fun

I seen the grass and the sky and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
We're in a world that I wanna lead

So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world

Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name (no name)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name",A Place with No Name [Original Version] [Version]

She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep

She works so hard, just to make her way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But then she did, he did not quit as she ran out the door

She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

She's a slave to the rhythm of

They realize on my name, and push from town to town
Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide
I've got to, find a place
So I won't hide away

But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games
It's time to make a change

Why is it I can't do whatever I want to?
Went in my personal life and I don't live for you
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me
You be concerned about you
I can do what I want to

I can't believe a year went by so fast
Time to see - What we have - Time to see

With the Fender guitar he just got out of hock
When he sold the car
That took him away and back

He found his song

Michael John Stanley,"Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall,
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

('How do you think he does it?)
I don't know!
(What makes him so good?')

Well, he ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind kid,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

He's a pinball wizard,
His score's a trillion more.
A pinball wizard,
The world's new pinball lord.
He's scoring more!
He's scoring more!
More more more more!

But I just handed my pinball crown to him.

I've been other places looking for my dream
Eastern cities move too fast, southern ones too slow
I can't go back to my past and I need some place to grow

I heard you got some places that I ought to see
L.A., L.A., find a place for me
In your spacious wings, where I want to be

How can I forget you after so many tears
I tell myself it's over but my heart never hears

Staring so far away
She can almost feel the southern wind blow
Almost touching her restless days

Sad eyes reaching for the door

Daylight loses to another evening
And still she spares me the word goodbye
She sits alone beside me fighting her feelings
She struggles to speak but in the end can only cry

A woman's silk lying on the floor

Michael Johnson,"The old folks don't talk much and they talk so slowly when they do
They are rich, they are poor, their illusions are gone, they share one heart for two
Their homes all smell of time, of old photographs and an old fashioned song
Though you may live in town, you live so far away when you've lived too long

And have they laughed too much, do their dry voices crack talking of times gone by
And have they cried too much, a tear or two still always seems to cloud the eye

They tremble as they watch the old silver clock when day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says yes, it says no, it says I'll wait for you

The old folks dream no more, the book have gone to sleep and the piano's out of tune
The little cat is dead and no more do they sing on a Sunday afternoon
They old folks move no more, the world's become too small, their bodies feel like lead
They might look out the window or else sit in a chair or else they stay in bed

And if they still go out arm in arm, arm in arm, in the morning chill
It's to have a good cry, to say their last goodbye to one who's older still

And then they go home to the old silver clock when day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says yes, it says no, it says I'll wait for you

The old folks never die, they just put down their heads and go to sleep one day
They hold each other's hand, like children in the dark but one would get lost anyway
And the other will remain just sitting in a room which makes no sound
It doesn't matter now, the song has died away and echoes all around

You'll see them when they walk through the sun filled park where children run and play
It hurts too much to smile, it hurts too much, but life goes on for still another day

As they try to escape the old silver clock when day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says yes, it says no, it says I'll wait for you

The old, old silver clock
That's hanging on the wall
That waits for us all",Old Folks
Michael Johnson,"Back in 1958, we drove an old V-8
And when it turned a hundred thou, we pushed it a mile

We didn't know who we were, we didn't know what we did
We were just on the road

Heading south from Canada on a graveled road a mile from Montana
Then my daddy read the sign that took us in the wrong direction

I asked my daddy where are we going, he just said we're following our nose
So I looked out the window and dreamed I was a cowboy

We didn't know who we were, we didn't know what we did
We were just on the road

I met a girl in a truck cafe, I fell in love almost right away
But the Mercury was ready to go and I had to leave her

We didn't know who we were, we didn't know what we did
We were just on the road

And when I'd seen all the sights, there was the moon so round
Go home, said the man in the moon, go home
Go home, said the man in the moon, go home
Because it's getting sorta late, and I'll soon put out my light

Michael Johnson,"Last night you pushed me a little too far
I was not coming back when I left in the car
And there was a time, an hour or two
I was feeling so free from you

I picked up a bottle and drove to the heights
I parked on a ridge and I looked at the lights
The engine was off and the radio on
And the singer sang and I sang along

And I was almost free, almost wasn't any you and me
I was almost free, whole new life ahead of me
Almost free

Sunrise rising over the wheel
The bottle is empty and so is the feel
This car knows it's the wrong thing to do
But it's driving me home to you

Maybe I'm too much in love to be strong
Maybe you knew I'd be back all along
And if I could be who you wanted I would
If I could forget I'd be gone for good

I was almost free, almost wasn't any you and me
I feel almost free
Whole new life ahead of me, almost free

Just too hard to walk this line
Maybe baby, I'll make it next time

Almost free, almost wasn't any you and me
I was almost free, whole new life ahead of me
I was almost free, almost wasn't any you and me
I was almost free, whole new life ahead of me
Almost free",Almost Free
Michael Johnson,"If there are reasons why I should come down off this cloud
I don't know them
If the law says that walking on air is not allowed
I'll just show them, I'll just show them

And if I am not dreaming, then dreams do come true
And if someone loves somebody anymore than I do
It must be you

If there are reasons why I should not feel so alive
I don't buy them
And if they tell me our love's just too hot to survive
I deny them, I defy them
 
And if true love is unending then this love is true
And if someone loves somebody anymore than I do
It must be you

When it comes to forever, it's never too late
And if this isn't heaven, then heaven can wait

And if love was a candle, I'd shine like the sun
When the sun is an ember, you'll still be the one
And if someone loves somebody anymore than I do
It must be you, it must be you
It must be you, It must be you",It Must Be You

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again

Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

And fill my heart with faith that I won't lose.
I don't wanna lose ...


Give me one real love that I don't freeze out there,
Make me feel your presence in the night.
Give me one strong heart that tells me when I lie,
And take my soul - so I won't have to hide.
I don't wanna hide ...

Souls are dying everywhere but whatever I do I believe.

It's so cold deep down here, I know we had to fall,
Souls are dying everywhere but whatever I do ...
There'll be no reason to live without you giving me light,
There is so much that you give, your love is shining so bright.


I Believe ... I Believe ... I Believe ... Believe ...


I wanna love but I always hate - I wanna give but I always take.
Want you to laugh but I make you cry, maybe I won't change 'til I die.
It's so much easier said than done - I know I can't just always run.
Got so much anger inside of me, I understand but I think I see what I'm not.
I know it's true what J.C. said - I got it all clear in my head.
Seens we were born to be unfair,
I am a sinner that's starting to dare ... to Believe.


Give me your hand until the end and I will waik into promised land.
I don't deserve anything you do - but I can't stop loving you.


No more lies, no false religions,
No more ""whys"" and wrong God missions.
No shiny T.V. priests begging to cash,
No more wars that no God's ever asked for.
There's a way back out of here - one day we're going home,
Tell everyone who wants to hear - whatever you do ... do Believe.

Michael Kiske,"In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night I call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
The songs I sing, all my love - I bring for you.


I always try to makethings better, everything that has gone wrong,
Mighty plans in the right direction but very little has been done.
Everyday when I try to get forward - I find myself another mile back,
Help me fighting, help me breathing - why am I falling down instead ?
Every useful minute seems to be the thoughtof you,
Every hour seems like wasted, filled with things that I might do.
Without love in my reactions seems the saddest thing, but it's true.


In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night I call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
The songs I sing, all my love - I bring for you.


Free from ourselves and free form this world we may find,
The freedom we search ,'cause all that we need is inside.
The hours we waste - we may not get back for a while,
And when it gets dark - no chance will be there for atry.


When I wake up early in the morning I catch abook and jump inside,
I fill my head with a million wonders and try to fill the night with light.
The moment when I get things clearer - I see another mountain to climb.
And always when I think I'm nearer - I realize there is no time.


In the night I'm calling you - be my guide, help me through,
In the night I call your name - you're the light in times of shame.
Sometimes I cried after all Ilied to you.

The future we already fear
Seems like no way out, seems like there's no doubt
The future looks bright ahead

We're the kids of the century--we're lost in our games
No time for the memories we look in the haze
We're the kids of the century it wasn't our fault
Ev'rything's done mum, we fall
Let's keep on crying
But sometimes I don't wanna fall

Ev'rytime when you look around things will smile at you
Ev'rytime when you turn around you smell the truth
But you run away from the lies you can't say
Don't run away from the lies you can't say

We're the kids. . .

It's what I expect from my life
It's like a wire
That holds me back down to the ground

Oh, I hear you say
""That is the way of the world""
No, hear what I say
""I wanna do so much in my way""
Higher
I've set my limits and bounds
There's a fire
It's burning so hot in my head

Oh, I hear you say
""That is the way of the world""
No, hear what I say
""I wanna do so much in my way""

A little time to build up our lives
A little time to make up our minds

A little time, time

[Chorus]",A Little Time
Michael Kiske,"Now it's time - to shake it all up, to be free,
Now it's time - to make us some room to let us be.
Oh, it feels so bad, yes, if fells so bad,
When everything good looks so bad,
When everything right goes so wrong.


I am up - to break it all down what's in my way,
I won't stop until I am where I'm going to stay.
No one holds me back, no, no one holds me back,
Don't wanna be what I am not,
But it's gotta be myself who breaks my neck.


I look here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere,
Over my head - look over my head
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around
And you won't see no halo
We keep on looking 'til we know what for.
If you don't know it,I don't know it, we don't know it, who will know it?
It's driving me mad
All of us don't know what we should know, maybe one day we'll know,
I must hold it back inside
But anyway we've got to make a stop.


When the sinner searches sin - it's all of us,
When we finally search inside - it's under us.
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it - who must pay ?
All I've ever done - I've done for you !


In my mind - the battle goes on 'til I give up,
Will we find - the key of life we oncehave dropped ?
Do you really care ? - Tell me you really care !
You may find Mr. Blane, but the guilt of life burns everywhere.


Give me light to see my inside, give me light tosee my sin,
Over my head - look over my head
I'd never do what I regret, I've never done anything bad,
And you won't see no halo
You must be joking when you point at me.
Hey ! Don't you blame me ! Don't you touch me !
Won't you ever leave me be ? I wanna live! Don't wanna think!
It's driving me mad
Why should I give what I can drink ?
I must hold it back inside


When the sinner searches sin - it's all of us,
When we finally search inside - it's under us.
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it - who must pay ?
All I've ever done - I've done for you !


Pain - I feel inside - it's such a Shame.
No one fights fair but who's to Blame ?
Might be the game of life but it ain't over.
Now ! I walk my way firm any
Now ! My conscience speaks and there are Doubts !
But nothing's sure in life and it ain't over. Now !


I look here and you look there, I know it's got to be somewhere,
Over my head - look over my head
We look around and search around and walk around and hear around
And you won't see no halo
We keep on looking 'til we know what for.
If you don't know it,I don't know it, we don't know it, who will know it?
It's driving me mad
All of us don't know what we should know, maybe one day we'll know,
I must hold it back inside
But anyway we've got to make a stop.


When the sinner searches sin - it's all of us,
When we finally search inside - it's under us.
We keep on looking anyway if we don't find it - who must pay ?
All I've ever done - I've done for you ! ......



",When the Sinner
Michael Kiske,"[Music + lyrics: M. Kiske]

[Solo: both]

When I hold the key to open heaven's door
I will never make the mistake and give it back
When I hold the key to open my mind before it's too late
I will never give it back

[Bridge:]


There's just one way I see
The way I think it's right for me
You say to me I will repent what I do
If it's right I'll stop before

When I see the light of sun will fade away
And I reveal what I have loved before
It's too late when I can't see the hours I pay
And I reveal what I have loved before

[Bridge:]


There's just one way I see
The way I think it's right for me
You say to me I will repent what I do
If it's right I'll stop before

[Chorus:]


The life I try to give is
All I have inside of me
It's one kind of life for me
This music you hear
The strength we have inside is
So much more than you will know
But if you can't see the life around
You'll always walk alone

[Solo: Kai/Mike]

Look at the drunk man, look into his eyes
See his strong hands
But tomorrow they will tremble cold as ice
See the drunk man, try to ask him why
He will laugh, and tomorrow he will tell you another lie
There's a fight in his head he cannot win
Getting stronger, makes him mad, burning sin

You--you cannot hide
You--you cannot describe your feelings inside

[Solo: Mike/Kai]

[Chorus:]


The life I try to give is
All I have inside of me
It's one kind of life for me
This music you hear
The strength we have inside is
So much more than you will know
But if you can't see the life around
You'll always walk alone



",You Always Walk Alone
Michael Kiske,"Now there is this day, a lot of things are changing
Can't just kick it away, got to get things right
Sometimes it happens fast and nothin' seems to last
The thing that I once started isn't mine anymore
I guess now it's my turn

You've got a face like a child, got a mind like a woman
Your smile is warm and tender
I hear the people say that I should stay away
From you and all the problems you might bring
They'll never know--you
Nobody ever knows what to do
They'll never see you cry
They'll never know why

Now it's your turn to break free
When you want it all you've got to see
Now it's your turn to break free
When you want the life, you've got to see what it means

See the little boy holding mama's hand
His eyes can see the things we've long forgotten
The world is easy now--and somehow
He's right
Until there is this day when Mickey Mouse must go away

It's your turn to break free. . .

This world is crying to be free
This world is dying can't you see
We need a turn to do it right
We need a mind-revolution
To get away from this selfishness
Stop playing blind--break free



",Your Turn
Michael Kiske,"Feelings come and go, I've never known,
Something longs to grow, won't let go.
Spirits around my head, are whispering,
I turn inside instead, of wondering.

Deep inside of me, I know there's got to be,
A different kind of truth, that sets the spirit free.
If I don't wanna know, what's written inside me,
How could I see anything, how could I be anything ?

Restless minds have searched, long before,
The truth will be same, for evermore.
The mightiness of trees, that you can feel,
Can give you all you need, just listen still.
Here is love and there is pain.
It's all around, it's all the same,
There's nothing new that I could tell to you.
But still there is the universe inside of us that never bursts,
We might not know the mining yet, but I am sure we can't reject
The truth that is in everything, that is and has been and will be.

There is a long way to go, there is a high place to know,
There is a world to go through, but there's so much more to do
Until we're home!

Deep inside of me, I know there's got to be,
A different kind of truth, that sets the spirit free.
If I don't wanna know, what's written inside me,
How could I see anything, how could I be anything?
Feelings come and go, I've never known",Longing
Michael Kiske,"[Music + lyrics: M. Kiske]

Don't turn your head
Back to the wall
Don't close your eyes
And wait for your fall

If you believe that you know in this time
You've got anything to win
If you believe that you know
Then I say, ""you'll lose all again""

[Bridge:]


In this time there's nothing to get for you
You cannot really do what you want
You're a child, a prisoner in your mind
You are a victim of this hopeless time

You better believe all you do has a sense
It's not for nothing
You better believe all the troubles you have
Will play you someday

[Bridge:]


Why don't you help yourself and do the best
Put all the bombs back up their builders' ass
Why don't you stand up to say who you are
To show the people that paradise is not far

[Chorus:]


Oh, can't you see we got the right
To look into the future without no need to hide
No, we won't accept what you do
We stand up 'cause we're not the people you can abuse
Oh, can't you see we got the right
To say we are here to see the light
No, we don't wanna lose all again
Stand up, you people, to save the world
As good as you can

[Solo: both]

We are credulous idiots
And won't understand what they plan
We march with the times
It's what they expect and we do

Why don't you open your eyes
To undercover all of these lies
I think you won't accept this
Go oppose with your fist
Fight for your rights

[Chorus:]


Oh, can't you see we got the right
To say we are here to see the light
No, we don't wanna lose all again
Stand up, you people, to save the world
As good as you can
No, we don't wanna lose all again
Stand up, you people, to save the world
As good as you can

Could ever bring you back to me

Still haunt my memory

A taste of her lips still lingers in vain

He could offer more than long walks on the shore
My love for you was not enough
Girl I couldn't keep the flame alive
Still when I close my eyes it's you I visualize
Though I try to shout it out
Don't you know these feelings still survive

Was it just a fling a temporary thing
I find the letters that you wrote
And though I set you free you're still a part of me
The spell can not be broke

In my world I saw nothing else 
So many times I made you cry 
I never knew the reason why 

I couldn't face the truth that was inside

Checking my self checking myself searching my soul 
Looking at love through another's eyes 
Seeing things I never realize 
Kicking my self kicking my self I was 
But now I'm looking at love 

I stared deep into the mirror 
A hard look I ain't no hero 
For the first time I can see 
How hard it's been to love a man like me 
Your give me love with no conditions 
Your trust me with no suspicios 
I know I haven't done the same 
I never really saw your pain

When I woke up in my bed 
Opened my eyes this morning 
I saw the heavy black side of my soul 
was creeping out the window 
The happiness I felt disappeared again 
'cause there was someone 
knocking at my door 
I guess it was the postman 
with a lot of messages 
from the world outside 

Chorus: 
Keep all your bills 
keep all your papers away from here 
Leave me alone 
it is such a lovely day 
No matter what you do in your life 
You know you always have to sign 
In a world where we are drowning in papers 
it's difficult to hold the line 
Newspaper pages always full of lies 
Letters that make me cry 
Sometimes I think that I've got enough 
You better keep that stuff 
away from sy side 

Chorus: 
Keep all your bills 
keep all your papers away from here 
Leave me alone 
it is such a lovely day

Michael Learns to Rock,"You're such a serious girl 
You've got the weight of the world on your shoulders 
You hide away in your room 
And every day you get just that much older 

Your mind is filled with politics 
Global trends and dirty tricks 
Let it breathe let it be 
Find a little heaven (find a little heaven with me)

My blue angel it's no crime 
To make sweet love in the moonlight 
My blue angel there's a time 
A time for saving the day 
And time to fly away 

You've got a beautiful face 
Oh but you're wearing the saddest expression 
You know that life is too short 
For only seeing your darkest obsession 

You're so consumed with social views 
Conspiracies and hidden clues 
Give it up set it free 
Came and spread your wings (come and spread your wings for me)

Michael Learns to Rock,"After sometimes I've finally made up my mind
She is the girl and I really want to make her mine
I'm searching everywhere to find her again
To tell her I love her
And I'm sorry 'bout the things I've done
I find her standing in front of the church
The only place in town where I didn't search
She looks so happy in her wedding dress
But she's crying while she's saying this

Boy I missed your kisses all the time but
This is twenty five minutes too late
Though travelled so far
Boy I'm sorry you are
Twenty five minutes too late

Against the wind I'm going home again
Wishing me back to time when we were more than friends
But I still see her in front of the church
The only place in town where I didn't search
She looked so happy in her wedding dress
But she's cried while she was saying this

Boy I missed your kisses all the time but
This is twenty five minutes too late
Though travelled so far
Boy I'm sorry you are
Twenty five minutes too late

Out in the streets
Places where hungry hearts have nothing to eat
Inside my head still I can hear the words she said

Boy I missed your kisses all the time but
This is twentyfive minutes too late
Though travelled so far
Boy I'm sorry you are
Twenty five minutes too late

This is twentyfive minutes too late

Checking out each other 
Each and everyone 
Cooler tan the other

Dancing on the chairs 
Hanging on each other 
Each and every girl 
Sweeter than the other 
Music so loud that we have to drink our brains 
Out

I'm shouting at my date with the red nails 
Come take my hand and lets get out

We all came here to have some fun 
And if you don't want to party 
Get out of here and run

Wakes me up

On the smokey battlefield 
I am bleeding from my heart and i...

I guess I have to rest for a while

I spoke

You're gonna find the truth

It's such a beautiful sight
The way she moves like an angel

Rays of hope that hypnotize
They're a blessing in disguise
Lightning up my life

We can play
In our secret hideaway
We can go there everyday
Time is on our side

She blinded me with her light
It's such a beautiful sight
The way she moves like an angel

There will be no compromise
Now that I have realized
What they mean to me, oh yeah

Not a spiritual kind
But she became a revelation to me
She made me believe

She's the blue sky when it's cloudy in my mind

Nobody knows what I'm going through (hey baby why..)
You gave me frostbite in my heart
'Cause you tore the love we had apart
Somebody tell me now what I should do

I'm driving alone with the radio on in my car
I'm staring at faces in places that used to be ours

Can't you see what you do to me
I'm drowning in my misery
That fatal kiss of destiny
Is clinging on for evermore

[Chorus]

(I had to let you know) I keep thinking of you
(I can't let go) You know it's all that I do
(I had to let you know) 'Cause you are still on my mind all the time
Don't leave me hanging
You had me branded (Branded from the start)

Why leave me hanging... You had me branded
Don't keep me hanging on (Hey baby why...)",Frostbite
Michael Learns to Rock,"I've been looking for an angle
For a shortcut to your mind
There's no point for us to wrangle
So baby here's the bottom line (Here it goes)

I know you never left me when you ran away
'Cause I can tell you missed me more than you will say

Suddenly the sky turns blue I'm hit by a feeling
Whenever I am close to you my troubles fade away
Suddenly the wind gets warm I'm finally breathing (tonight)
That is how I know where I belong - you will always be the one

If you're ever feeling lonely
And you ever change your mind

You know I never blamed you for being brave
When I was way too scared to face the mess we'd made

Suddenly the sky turns blue I'm hit by a feeling
Whenever I am close to you my troubles fade away
Wherever I go and whatever I do
I'm always reaching out for you
That is how I know where I belong - you will always be the one

I am still reminded how we sat in silence
And you smiled at me and said
There's no need for us to cry 'cause this is not goodbye

Suddenly the sky turns blue I'm hit by a feeling

Michael Learns to Rock,"I stayed up late last night
I thought of the days gone by
The picture of you and me
Is not what it used to be

Something happened along the way
Little changes in our game
Somehow everything's brighter now
My heart knows the reason why

We can't hide from love any longer
It can't be denied with you I'm alive

I used to think that love was escapable
Can't see why we should be divided
Isn't life just unbelievable
Now I'm coming home to you

I'm beginning to understand
The way that I feel inside

So how could we let it be
When there's so much more to see

We can't hide from love any longer
I know what I feel I know this is real

But if you leave my world tomorrow
And if you leave me cold tonight
(If you're gonna leave me cold tonight)
(Do you really want to see me cry)
I'm gonna live my life in sorrow
And you'll forever see me cry
(If you're gonna leave me cold tonight)

What about the home that we were building up
What about the colours in our hearts
What about the kids we should be playing with
Should we leave this fantasy into the dark

You are as shining as the sun
You are the place where I belong

Do you share the pain inside
Do you know how much it bites
Do you mind to watch me fall
Do you care for me at all

This wasn't meant to be baby can't you see
This is an open invitation for the beginning of the end
Though I'm flying now, I'm gonna be crying over you

Tell me where do I find someone like you girl

Take me to your heart take me to your soul
Give me your hand before I'm old
Show me what love is - haven't got a clue
Show me that wonders can be true

They say nothing lasts forever
We're only here today
Love is now or never
Bring me far away

Take me to your heart take me to your soul
Give me your hand and hold me
Show me what love is - be my guiding star
It's easy take me to your heart

Standing on a mountain high
Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky
I should go and see some friends
But they don't really comprehend

Don't need too much talking without saying anything
All I need is someone who makes me want to sing

Played a part

Around us in our violence, Laughter for our silence,
Yes, but underneath the comfort of our dinner conversations, 
There‚Äôs a fumbling of the moments, Cause we know that we are fading

But we were supposed to be beautiful, you and I
We were supposed to be beautiful, and though we try
We are not so beautiful, you and I

Just another grey-sky morning, Cast aside the scorning 
Of the second-hand clock ticking, Quickening the moments 
And every day bleeds into yesterday and into tomorrow
Until we find our way back down under this earth we only borrow

But we were supposed to be beautiful, you and I
We were supposed to be beautiful, and though we try
We are not so beautiful, you and I

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,

Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,

And I thought no one
would ever make me feel this way
It feels me up every time

what's going on inside me head

get love to lead the way

feel her love is mine

Rolled his sleeves up, opened up his case
Played Cherokee Fiddle, played for the whiskey

Then he'd go home to Oklahoma

And I'll never let it burn out of control

Told the story of the places that they'd been
Now their home is a highway
That never seems to end

Empty dreams and empty pockets
Sure can make a heavy load
To some of us it's just a highway
But to others it's desperation road

Their eyes had a sadness
From another place in time
A silent reminder that the grapes of wrath
Still make bitter wine

And it sure makes you wonder
'Bout all the seeds our country sows
Which of us will be the next
To travel down desperation road

I helped them start their pickup
And watched them as they faded out of sight
Guess the last thing I remember
Is the faces of the children in my lights

That night in a motel room
I have a dream that made my blood run cold
I saw my own wife and family
Standing out on desperation road

And their eyes had a sadness
From another place in time
A silent reminder that the grapes of wrath
Still make bitter wine

And it sure makes you wonder
'Bout all the seeds our country sows
Which of us will be the next
To travel down desperation road

Could be your own wife and family

Michael Martin Murphey,"Gonna buy some wood every size and length
Gonna build it good using all my strength
Gonna clear the land where the house will be
And start another branch of the family tree

Gonna chalk a line and lay a walnut floor
Build the walls of pine and hang a cherry door
I'll cut the beams above from mahogany
And I'll get the love from the family tree

I've wandered far and I've walked alone
Till the morning star finally led me home
Now I'm here to stay where I was meant to be
Living in the shade of the family tree

Gonna fill this place like my daddy did
With a friendly face and a bunch of kids
Even though he's gone he's a part of me
As I carry on this family tree

Girl, the wind may blow and the clouds may come
Bringing ice and snow, blocking out the sun
The earth may quake and the ground may freeze
They will never shake this family tree

I've wandered far and I've walked alone
Till the morning star finally led me home
Now I'm here to stay where I was meant to be

Michael Martin Murphey,"I met a lady in my drifting days
I quickly fell under the spell of her loving ways
A rose in the desert I loved her so
In the land of enchantment, New Mexico

We watched the sunset by the Rio Grande
A mission bell, rang farewell, she took my hand
She said, ""Come back amigo, no matter where you go
To the land of enchantment, New Mexico""

From her arms I wandered far across the sea
I often heard her gentle words haunting me
Come back amigo, I miss you so

I'm gonna get so lost, I'll find myself again
I'm gonna drift away like woodsmoke in the wind

There's a place I know high up in the snow
Waiting for me like a long lost friend
And there I'll build a fire as I watch the flame go higher
And give this heartache time to mend

I'm gonna get so lost, I'll find myself again
I'm gonna drift away like woodsmoke in the wind
Gonna get so lost, I'll find myself again

I wonder if I'll ever love again
Does it always end the same, is love a dying flame
That drifts away like woodsmoke in the wind?

Now, alas, must my fond hopes all vanish

O how lonely and how dreary it will be
And do you think of the kind hearts you're breaking
And the pain you are causing to me

Come and sit by my side, if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu

Michael Martin Murphey,"Spanish is the lovin' tongue
Soft as springtime, light as spray
There was a girl I learned it from
Living down Sonora way
Now I don't look much like a lover
Yet I say her love words over
Late at night when I'm all alone
""Mi amor, mi corazon""

There were nights when I would ride
She would listen for my spurs
Fling that big door open wide
Raise those laughing eyes of hers
And how those hours would get to flyin'
Pretty soon, I'd hear her cryin'
""Please don't leave me all alone
Mi amor, mi corazon""

Then one night I had to fly
I got into a foolish gamblin' fight
I had a swift goodbye
In that black unlucky night
And traveling north, her words kept ringing
And every word I could hear her singing
""Please don't leave me all alone
Mi amor, mi corazon""

Well, I ain't never seen her since that night
I can't cross the line now
She was Mexican, and I was White
Like as not, it's better so
And yet I've always sort of missed her
Since that last wild night I kissed her
I left my heart, but I lost my own

Slavin' in the saddle all day
You've got to be some kind of natural born fool
To want to live your life this way

Well it can't be the cooking, it sure ain't the money
The devil made the horse that I ride
The days are too long and the nights are too short
And the boss ain't never satisfied

So what am I doing here Lord? What am I doing here?
There's got to be something better up there
So what am I doing here?

Sometimes I wonder in the lightning and the thunder
If a cowboy's even got a prayer
And why'd you have to make it so hard down here
When things are so much better up there

Said, ""Boys I must be wastin' my time

Michael Martin Murphey,"I remember a country evening
When the sun was going down
Sittin' on the front porch
Listenin' to the sounds

While mama did the dishes
Daddy rolled a smoke
From a can of old Prince Albert
His hands as strong as oak

And the sounds of the Grand Old Opry came out of Ryman Hall
Roy Acuff played the fiddle and sang, Wabash Cannonball
Hank Williams whispered, I Saw the Light
And people everywhere sat listening in the night

Out in radio land, out in radio land
We all closed our eyes, listen to the band
Out in radio land, out in radio land
We all dreamed of radio land

Then Wolfman Jack came a howlin'
From across the Rio Grande
Layin' down the sounds that all the kids could understand
Mama and daddy was sleepin'

But the kids were wide awake
Listenin' to Bill Haley rattle, roll, and shake
Ol' Jerry Lee banged on the keys and screamed, Great Balls of Fire
Elvis crooned out, Don't Be Cruel
The girls swooned with desire

Out in radio land, out in radio land
We all closed our eyes, listen to the band
Out in radio land, out in radio land
We all dreamed of radio land

I remember summer evenings
Late night rock and roll
Miles and miles of highway
With just my radio

I remember a night when it felt so right
A lover's moon above
And the songs that they were playin'
The night we fell in love

Out in radio land, out in radio land
We all closed our eyes, listen to the band
Out in radio land, out in radio land
We all dreamed of radio land

We both closed our eyes
Listened to the band
Out in radio land, out in radio land
We fell in love in radio land

Out in radio land, out in radio land
We all closed our eyes, listen to the band
Out in radio land, out in radio land
We all dreamed of radio land

We still close our eyes
And listen to the band
Out in radio land, out in radio land
We still dream in radio land

And it's not my way to let them lead me astray;

Michael Martin Murphey,"Let me tell you a tale and a good one I own of an old caballo a strawberry roan
I was hangin' round town just a spendin' my time out of a job and not earnin' a dime
When a stranger steps up and he says
I suppose you're a bronc rider by the looks of your clothes
I says guess your right there's none I can't tame
If its ridin' wild ponies that my middle name
Oh that strawberry roan oh that strawberry roan
He says he's a cayuse that's never been rode
The guy that gets on him is bound to get throwed
Throwed of that strawberry roan

Out in the horse corral standin' alone is an old caballo, a strawberry roan
Spavined old legs and small pigeon toes pair of pig eyes and a long Roman nose
Little pin ears and they're split at the tip a big forty four brand was on his left hip
So I puts on my spurs and I coils up my twine
Says to that stranger that ten spot is mine
Oh that strawberry roan oh that strawberry roan
I'll break him to saddle or break him my own
I'll ride him until he lies down with a grown
Bring on your strawberry roan

Then I puts on my blinds and it sure is a fight
Next comes the saddle I screws her down tight
Steps up aboard him and rises the blind get out the way boys he's gonna unwind
Shore is a broad walker he heaves a big sigh
He only lacks wings for to be on the fly
He's the worse buckin' bronco I've seen on the range
Turn on a nickle and give you some change
Oh that strawberry roan oh that strawberry roan
That sunfishin' critter's worth leavin' alone
There's nary a buster from Texas to Nome
Can ride that strawberry roan

Michael Martin Murphey,"When the fiddlin' man came to our town
Sister dressed up in her prettiest gown
Momma told sister don't be hanging around
That no good fiddlin' nan

'Cause a fiddlin' man he ain't on the level
He'll fiddle like an angel act like a devil
Sister wouldn't listen she was a rebel
She liked that fiddlin' man

She went to the dance stayed all night long
Momma waited up 'til the break of dawn
Momma found a letter and said she's gone
Off with that fiddlin' man

Sister ran off with a fiddlin' man
Momma threw a fit bangin' pots and pans
Said she'd better never ever get her hands
On that no good fiddlin' man

So I bought me a fiddle and I got me a bow
Practiced in the woods where
Momma wouldn't know
Knew she'd never ever let me go
Off to be a fiddlin' man

And the leaves and the wind would dance and twirl
As I played for the rabbits and played for the squirrels
Couldn't wait 'til I played for the girls

Had to be a fiddlin' man
And late one night when the moon was low
I packed my fiddle and I packed my bow
Momma found a note and said ""Oh, no""
He's gone to be a fiddlin' man

And I ran off to be a fiddlin' man
Momma threw a fit bangin' pots and pans
Said she'd better never ever get her hands
On that no good fiddlin' man

Well then one night when I started to play
I saw a pretty gal looking my way
She was dancing with her brother
And I heard her day I like that fiddlin' man

Now her little brother was about knee high
Looked at the fiddle with a gleam in his eye
Said to me sir, I'd sure like to try
To learn to be a fiddling man

I said son, there's a whole lot a boys gotta know
Like chicken in the brier patch squawking at the crow
He said I don't care I just got to go
Off to be a fiddlin' man

So I had an old fiddle that I never did play
Sister winked when I gave it away
Ain't no doubt what momma's gonna say
That no good fiddlin' man

And brother ran off with a fiddlin' man
Momma threw a fit bangin' pots and pans
Said she'd better never ever get her hands
On that no good fiddlin' man

Don't you know anything
We're gonna stay in touch
We'll give you all a ring

We'll get the pictures out
We'll pass each one around
Our fire on the beach
My goodness, you were brown

And they will live again
We'll make them live again

For you, you, I'm gonna miss you, girl
Yeah you, you, I'm gonna miss you, girl
Oh you, you, I'm gonna miss you, girl
Yeah you, you, I'm gonna miss you, girl

You don't know how I feel
I never told you
Oh, I was much too shy
So I'll never hold you

I hide my heart away
I have my reasons
I have my memories
Of when love was in season

You can forget the past
It's only cause to cry
Soon as a love appears
It's time to say goodbye

Wipe all the tears away
They don't do any good
You put me from your mind
Just like I knew you would

Smile when you hear my name
Why can't I do the same?

For you, you, I'm gonna miss you, girl
Yeah you, you, I'm gonna miss you, girl
Oh you, you, I'm gonna miss you, girl
Yeah you, you, I'm gonna miss you, girl
Oh you, you, I'm gonna miss you, girl
Yeah you, you, I'm gonna miss you, girl",I'm Gonna Miss You Girl

Michael Matera,"I met this girl Friday night she said why don't you come with me
Anywhere let's take a flight she said, ""Who knows what we might see?""
I was ready to go but I didn't know that fate was gonna stop me
I met this girl she rocked my world and she's there waiting for me
But the train was late, she's at the gate, stuck in the rain, she got on the plane
I guess this girl will hate me forever
I guess were not meant to be together

[Chorus:]
If that's the way it is
Then that's the way it goes
And everybody knows
If that's the way it feels
Then that's the way it flows
It's out of your control
Just let go
Let go

I thought I knew back in school that I would be a doctor
Mom said, ""Study hard and you'll go far."" But then I went and shocked her
I said I'm leaving today to go to L.A. I want to be a rock star
I thought I knew, but I'm a fool
Now I'm sleeping on the cold floor
Where the private jet - ain't happened it
Kristal champagne, stuck in the rain
Sorry mom don't hate me forever
I guess I should of kept it together

[Chorus]
If that's the way it is
Then that's the way it goes
And everybody knows
If that's the way it feels
Then that's the way it flows
It's out of your control
Just let go
Just let go

You can try to make the sun rise again
You can try to turn the tides, but you can't
You can drive the car
You can sign your name
Hold on so tight that you'll go insane
You can try to plan your life to the end
You can try to run the race until you win
You can buy the house
You can own the car
Doesn't matter who you are
I said the train is late you gotta wait
Your private plane is sitting in the rain
All of us are in it together so let go
Let go (let go)

[Chorus x2]
If that's the way it is
Then that's the way it goes
And everybody knows
If that's the way it feels
Then that's the way it flows
It's out of your control
Just let go
Let go",Let Go

Michael McDermott,"Ma always told me stories of you
Of the fountain on the day you met
Tyrone Power had nothin' on you
By the way you moved in that Stetson hat
I'm sorry things didn't work out
Quite like you planned
But nowadays you don't talk so much
Of those warrior days and that goal line stand

I'd do anything to fight your fears
I'd do anything to get back those years for you
I'd do anything to have seen the way you walked back then
I'd do anything to see you smile again

You had a vision of the bluest sky
But now your caught by the shades of grey
you had a vision that you could fly
But your wings never got you that far away

I'd do anything to fight your fears
I'd do anything to get back those years for you
I'd do anything to have seen the way you walked back then
I'd do anything to see you smile again

See you lookin' out the window, see you lookin' into space
Your wonderin' how you ever ended up in this place
These words are the hardest, I've waited to this day
To speak the things I feel and to find the strength
To say.... talk to me

I see destruction and the bullets flyin'
The only thing I can hear is the sound of angels cryin'
In a day like tomorrow I know we're gonna find our way
The wings that you borrow you got to give back someday
I saw a sunset of sorrow goin' down in your eyes

In a day like tomorrow we'll weave together these pieces of our lives
You spoke of forgiveness with that dagger in your hand
You danced along the water while the wind swept through the sand
You wanna know just how I feel, babe you wouldn't understand

In a day like tomorrow I know we're gonna find our way
The wings that you borrow you got to give back someday
I saw a sunset of sorrow goin' down in your eyes

Your torn by the midwestern storms
Come to me I'll be your shelter
The borders are gettin' bigger, there's silence behind every door
Even my brothers don't recognize me anymore
There's a poisonous water that rushes to each and every shore

Michael McDermott,"Broken she had spoken, ""Here's a token of a lonely one""
The Idler stood beside of her, wonderin' whether to walk or run
""Rain"" he said, ""Tell me again, how you got your funny name""
She said, ""My house is the only one on that street,
I live at One South Rainey's Lane""
""Jesus, where is he when you need him"" Rain said and threw a penny into the well
""He's usually"" spoke the Prophet, ""behind you and your just too dumb to tell""
Rain said ""Who are you? You look like a drunken fool,
I wasn't talkin' to you anyway""
The Prophet said ""I'm no one baby, just like you,
but I can spot a joker coming a mile away....hey""
The prophet said ""You can turn and you turn, tryin' to find yourself
You turn and you turn 'til there's no one else
You turn and you turn, until you turn insane""
Aching hours and aching days with the Idler, the Prophet and a girl called Rain
The Prophet he was smokin' by the well runnin' his hands through his greasy hair
The Idler wasn't movin' he was gazin' into the stillness of the air
Rain she sat, adjusted her hat, and said somethin' as a city bus roared by
The Prophet said ""I'm sorry I didn't catch your name""
as he looked into the troubled oceans of her eyes
Rain said ""Forget it, now... it doesn't matter anyhow. I'm just a cat out on the ledge""
The Prophet said ""Melodrama suits you girl... I just don't think you've got the edge""
The Idler looked twice and he rolled his dice and said ""You know what would be nice?...
If you two would shut up for a while""
The Prophet said ""That's fine with me""
Rain nodded, she seemed to agree and the Idler began to smile,
Just like a child... The Prophet said,
""You can turn and you turn tryin' to find yourself
You turn and you turn 'til there's no one else
You turn and you turn in a baptism of flame""
The wind swept like a revelation with the Idler, the Prophet and a girl called Rain
The Idler said ""Indecision's, ruthless""
as he saw a toothless mother near her child engulf a beer
Rain said ""I've fallen so many times these days no one believes it or seems to care""
The Prophet said ""Is it all about the future is it all about the fear of livin' with the pain.
Or is it all about weakness, temptations curtain tricks or findin' someone to blame""
The Idler said ""I'm gonna call it a night I heard the sage was gettin' somethin' goin'.
Somethin' about russian roulette, on a blackjack bet, wine and blood will be flowin'.
and do me a favor, if you see the president tell him I got somethin' right here for him.
You two run along now, be careful, cuz you never know what kind of trouble two people could get in...remember
""You can turn and you turn tryin' to find yourself
You turn and you turn 'til there's no one else
You turn and you turn , but it's never gonna be the same""
The sky bled of dying dreams above the Idler, the Prophet and a girl called Rain
The Prophet and Rain walked to the water
Castin' stones into the night
They went down Rainey's Lane to Rain's place and made love,
and fell asleep after it was light
Rain woke to the sounds of the parade
The Prophet he was no where in sight
He left a note on the mirror sayin' ""Believe in the Rain and the Rain will be alright""
and she could remember him sayin'...
""You can turn and you turn tryin' to find yourself
You turn and you turn 'til there's no one else
You turn and you turn and never understand the pain""
I guess that's the story...

Michael McDermott,"I wasn't lookin' for somethin' different
I was sailing slowly losing all control
I was goin' down in the dirty water
Deep into the middle of my soul
There like a streak of lightning, illuminating everything in sight
I surrendered to this senseless fighting
I surrendered to this senseless light
Over top of yonder mountain, over there where the rainbow ends
I took a drink from the holy fountain
Down around where the river bends
The further I followed this fallen path
The more I trusted in this fear
Then revealed in the aftermath
I didn't know who I was, what, or where

Just west of Eden, from Chicago to Gethsemane
Just west of Eden, the flowers smelled like tragedy
Just west of Eden

Communion came like rollin' water
Like a feast to a hungry beast
I knelt beside a ploughman's daughter
Whose thirst never seemed to cease
The gateway to the wicked led the lost under their wing
Silence fell upon this hopeless town and the bells of innocence began to ring

Just west of Eden, where Cain paved a pavement of sin
Just west of Eden, the trumpet wailed and the walls caved in...
Just west of Eden

Graced by the hours and the mindless traps
In which even the noblest fall
Love's longing flower brought humility unto us all
I stood engulfed by temptations smile
Searching for the only key
Reverent eyes fell upon my brow
While she moved in the air like poetry
Clutching on to this sword, I hold the names of all the men
I rip myself from this chord
Falling free to find myself again
I seize the darkness with a sharpened tongue
Then spit it out at last
I watch the lighthouse from the water
Beware of the coming of the past

Just west of Eden, crucifixions while the cities burn
Just west of Eden, the priest wailed and the poet yearned
Just west of Eden, insolence, prejudice, and cowardice are learned...
Just west of Eden",Just West of Eden
Michael McDermott,"No matter how hard it might seem to be
Know I'd be there if you ever needed me
Chambers of sound, love lost and found tonight
There's somethin' in the air, somethin' doesn't feel right

If I had a map, I'd guide your troubled path
If I had a smile, I'd lend you mine to laugh
If I had a treasure, you know just what I'd do
If I had a lantern, I'd light the way for you

You always said, ""Michael, just play the hand you're dealt""
I don't know if you ever knew how I felt
I wish I could have said the things I always wanted to say
Well, I'm sayin' them now if you can hear me today

If I had some wings, I'd fly you all around
If I had a some money, I'd buy the whole goddamn town
If I had the strength then maybe I could have pulled you through
If I had a lantern, I'd light the way for you
If I had a lantern, I'd light the way for you

One more night of drinkin' and singin' them jukebox tunes
I'd give everything just to spend one more day with you
I'll think of you when the rain comes and I'll find your face in the falling snow
I hope you think of me too, there's one thing you should know  (i'm sorry)

If I had some sunshine, I'd cast it all on you
If had the power, your dreams would all come true
I know you must be frightened too, don't you know that I'm scared too
If I had a lantern, I'd light the way for you
If I had a lantern, I'd light the way for you

Don't hide your love...",Lantern
Michael McDermott,"Have you ever been afraid to move, cuz you thought somehow you might break
Have you ever heard a voice that you couldn't ignore
Ever had a feelin' that you couldn't shake
I'm frightened by the way I feel, and maybe you are too
I'm losing faith in everything and everyone but you
And still there's a bitter wind at night that cries
I don't know what it is but there's somethin' goin' on inside your eyes
Gonna leave it up to the angels

Time and time again I have been kept down,
By the same hands that lift me up
I found some strength in humility, found some comfort in this drunken cup
I turned to look for you but you weren't anywhere
Baby I'm reminded every time
Every time that bell rings, when I see certain things
Like that crazy heart you drew around your name and mine
Lookin' through these shades of grey, it gets so hard to see
But I'm ridin' on a wave in an ocean of uncertainty
Gonna leave it up to the angels

Baby, 'bout time that you choose, you gonna keep me
or you gonna turn me loose,
cuz I don't know what to do
You are the hand that fans the fire
You're the princess in the night of my dreams
You pushed me over the edge of desire
You are the passion at the heart of my screams
You are the stone I know someday could simply break my heart
You are the wind, you are the waves the could tear my lowly sails apart
And you tell me that you're feelin' so confused,
I've finally realized that the only thing that we can do is to
Leave it up to the angels

Surrender",Leave It up to the Angels
Michael McDermott,"These evenings soaked with dreams hung on the lines of eternity
Stephanie and me we were caught in the light of reality
Fixed on a star like a candle hangin' above me
I'm never gonna stray too far from my savior in second hand blue jeans
It's a losing proposition when you're born on this block
Your eyes can't move and your legs can't talk
I can't even begin to explain the staleness in the air
We were just two lost souls gettin' wasted on a moonlit prayer

Conner and Des sat there so statuesque
On barstools leanin' forward lookin' in need of some rest
The accordion player with that jagged one eyed smile
Said ""I'm gonna take a little break and I'll be back in just a while""
While the old songs of Ireland disappeared into the walls
The bandit boy was carvin' his perversions in the stalls
Stumblin' to the street he walked away like he didn't have a care
He was dressed like poisonous sunlight wishin' on a moonlit prayer

Detroit Junior was in a mid life scheme
Another aberration to his real life dream
Slippin' and slidin' and a skatin' with the best
He was always on the corner with Connie in her Guatemalan vest
Tellin' tales of when he was a singer right before the war
He'll never get a chance to tell us why he kicked that chair to the floor
Some kids were at the quarry last night they said hey saw his ghost with fire in his hair
he was dancin' on the water.....
Under a moonlit prayer

There's balconies and barbers and a mistress in the door
There's a shrine of faith in the window upon the second floor
At the bottom of the hamper is where all of Earl's money is stashed
And the marks upon the wall mark the day since she's passed
The supermarket junkies are out on parade
With their nickels in their pockets
And their bottles of Chardonnay
Smashing those broken bottles and those bodies into the walls of despair
Disappearing down the alley
Lost in a moonlit prayer

Stephanie accept me just the way I am
For my love is one of limits and of things that I don't understand
In this nameless town and a tainted crown I'm a king without a throne
But I still get overcome with doubt in these nights all alone
I've been lookin' for a sign babe, I haven't got a clue
If you surrender your heart to me
I'll surrender mine to you
Imagine the two of us riding bareback in the distance on a silk white mare
We'll disappear into the sky
Chasin' a moonlit prayer ",Moonlit Prayer
Michael McDermott,"Margaret quoted Whitman, and talked about the grass
She had bells around her ankles and spoke of a love that's sure to last
I knew of all her tragedy
I could see through her veneer
She said, ""I wish to Christ that somethin' for once would just seem clear""
With my life I swore I'd always defend her
Now She's gone and I need some surrender

In between the hours in which daylight fades away
These sad and lonely flowers trampled by decay
Can you understand how it gets so hard to stand
When everything you once held is taken from your hands
The colors danced across the auburn skies of November
Now I need some surrender


O come all ye faithful

Have you ever chased a rainbow or thrown darts up at the moon
Ever followed a fallin' star through the windows of your room
All the things that we believe in
Will all soon pass away
But I'm wiser than I once was
And gettin' more foolish every day
As a child I played on the streets of promise
With hearts of splendor
I'm older now, and I need some surrender",Need Some Surrender
Michael McDermott,"Silence fell like healing, as I turned to shout
""Won't somebody up there please help me out?""
There's a dead end street around every corner I take
And the daylight displays my greatest mistakes
Hallucinations, body and soul
Each night I feel a little more less in control
She spoke of Whitman and the turnin' of the leaves
Lovers were made for nights like these

I've been waiting on the wonder, I dream does exist
They smile as I'm goin' under and claim I'll be missed
One step away from paradise one step away from pain
The seeds of despair bloom into weeds of shame
I've seen a fallen rainbow in white and black
I can feel that restless shadow stickin' knives in my back
But there's penance and passion, patience and peace
Lovers were made for nights like these

Now the cool majestic evening invites me to burn
I've been waitin' for tomorrow but tonight it's my turn
Intoxicated by the banter that the bluebird sings
By the visions of forgiveness when those church bells ring
I've seen the face of evil, sometimes it looks like mine
I've confronted all my weaknesses, down on my knees

Lovers were made of nights like these
Dreamin' was made for nights like these
Salvation was made for nights like these
Forgiveness was made for nights like these

Michael McDermott,"Time wasted waiting and time contemplating my life
I've been thinkin' and drinkin'
But it feels like I'm sinkin' tonight
Sing alleluia, but don't let 'em fool ya, it's just temptation
I act as if it doesn't matter, while I step out of time
To the clatter of generations

Like a sailor, I'm driftin'
Into the hungry mouth of the storm
Like an orphan I'm searching for a place that's safe and warm
Like a scavenger I'll find the pieces
Of our lives which have been torn
Like a sailor I'll surrender unto the sea
Like a fire I'll be reborn

Blue tide tumbles upon itself
The night would never mistake me for someone else
For it knows
Blue desert rumbles my formless track
""I'll be dead before I ever come back"" she told me
Driftin' so endlessly, movin' so friendlessly
Under the candlelit moon
If there's a chance for contact send some word
To the dark haired girl on Pine and Third
That I'll be comin' soon

Like a sailor in the dark hand of mystery
I'll search the sea and it's soul
Like a knight I'll guard your frozen gates
With a heart that burns like coal
Like a vagrant I stand bewildered for I know not which way to got
Like a sailor I'll surrender unto the sea
Like a fire I'll lose control

Marking the days, marking the years
I exit in dreams, dreams and fears of longing
Drifting into this mystical fog
I looked and swore I thought I saw the dawning

Like a sailor, I'm driftin'
Into the hungry mouth of the storm
Like an orphan I'm searching for a place that's safe and warm

Michael McDermott,"Gypsy nights, by the light of the lake I ride
I got a a hunger and the hunger well it's eatin' me up inside
I got a serpent in my heart, I got such anger that I just can't hide
Don't look now if you see me comin' around
I could swear that I'm lost, but it feels like I'm found
The nights begun to fall, I'm feelin' low but walkin' tall
Gonna stare down the face of defeat, gonna face my fears until they're beat
Somewhere at the end of the street

I waited for the letter to finally bring me some news
It never came and in that moment I know I'd have to choose
I've lost all the things that mattered, I could possibly lose
Don't look now, If you see me coming around
Don't look now, If you see me coming around
The sun has gone away, the disciples have been led astray
Our hero's have turned to cheats
But I'm gonna march to a different beat
Somewhere at the end of the street

I've gotten used to the things I know I should have said
I've gotten used to the horror I see nightly here in my head
I've gotten used to knowin' she's sleepin' in another man's bed
But don't look now if you see me goin' down
Don't look now yeah I'm just comin' around
Gonna rise up and find my way, gonna find myself a brand new day
Gonna stare down the face of defeat, find a love that will make me feel complete
Somewhere at the end of the street

Michael McDonald,"It's hard to bet your life on love
When all we learn is how to keep on moving
And the odds are never good enough
For all we know, nothing lasts forever in this life

Show me one thing that will never fade away
What goes with the fall, returns with the spring
This whole world is made that way
Who's to know if love will stay

[Chorus]
But there's nothing quite like this
That I've ever known
And I believe in it
There's no way out of it 
I can't let go
Because I believe in it

We second guess the things we see
When all too soon you know time will show
If love was never meant to be
Then we can't hide before too long
We'll know if it was right

Show me one thing that will never fade away
What goes with the fall, returns with the spring
This whole world is made that way
Who's to know if love will stay",Believe in It
Michael McDonald,"Maybe it's true what they say about it
Maybe we can't make the ends meet
Maybe we'll all have to do without it
Maybe this world's just incomplete

Still we all look for the truth in our lives
Searching from different sides
So hard living in a desperate world
But we all do the best that we can

Some people see a change
Some will remain the same
But all of them live their lives under the gun
Some see the road as clear
Some say the end is here
They say it's a hopeless fight, well I say I gotta try

Maybe there's too much to think about it
Maybe there ain't nothin' left to say
But if our time's really runnin' out
Then this is no time to run away

'cause we're destined to look for the truth in this life
Blinded by tearful eyes
If it's no use tryin' in a desperate world
Then tell me why was I born

Some people see a change
Some will remain the same
But all of them live their lives under the gun
Some see the road as clear
Some say the end is here
They say it's a hopeless fight, but I say I gotta try

Lonely-living too lonely
Is it too late
To turn it all around

Some people see a change
Some will remain the same
But all of them live their lives under the gun
Some see the road as clear
Some say the end is here
They say it's a hopeless fight, but I say I gotta try

Love lies-right to your face
Love lies-just when I had faith
It would let me down
I know that love lies-right to the end
Love lies-I know the word will never mean the same to me

What's this emptiness inside me
Where her promise used to be
She said she'd be here to guide me
I guess now the joke's on me
Oh, I thought love was something like devotion

That's why, I know this heart will survive
After you're gone

You know I believe all we really have is time
No use worrying, no use wondering why
Cause through it all, we're only here to laugh and cry
It's meant to be that failure only brings another way
Every heartache always has another day

We've got all we need

I'll be by your side

Tie your spirit to the ground

This ain't no time to stop before we begin
And though there's no promises

[Chorus:]
Everytime I think how good it could be
I start to be believe it's up to the stars
I should use my head
But that only tends to lose me and confuse me
Everytime I think how good it could be
I surely believe we'll make it that far
I should use my head
But I only know you by heart, by heart

Girl, I know I'm in
Over my head
But now I need to find out
Just what you want from me
And if I'm reaching too high, you know we live and learn

Michael McDonald,"By michael mcdonald & randy goodrum

Sometimes it seems to me
A long and tender love
Is just not meant to be
It's just not of this world

The more we live with this love
The more we learn to ignore
We keep our feelings inside
Until we open the door

Chorus:
It's in my heart, it's in your eyes
It's waving us on
Till everything stops, everything dies
(we can't stop now, we've come this far)
Don't let me down

'cause in it's darkest hour
A love that's still worthwhile
Will always stand it's ground
If we just realize

The more we give to this love
The more we know that it's right
But if the time ever comes
That we should look for that light

My wheels are the only sound
Runnin' at the speed of sight
I can't slow down

Out on the open road
Racing to beat the night
No matter where I go
Guess I'll get there all right

So why don't I understand
What's trippin' me up
It used to be a simple thing

I can't hold on, I can't return
Time to let go, start to live and learn

I took the one way flight
Too high to see the ground
Now I know how long it takes
A heart to come down

Why don't I understand
What's trippin' me up
It ought to be a simple thing

I can't hold on, I can't return
Time to let go, start to live and learn

I can't hold on, I can't return
Rivers will run, bridges will burn
I'm not sure just how
But there's no lookin' back now

Floating like waves at sea
We make it day by day
Watching the world go by

In a moment where time stands still
From here we look out on forever

[Chorus]
Darling, our love
One love that never fades away

This love will light the world on its way

Shattered, broken dreams
Sifting like grains of sand
We claim it and here we stay
Watching the world go by

With the strength that we spend in this life
In the hope that it goes on forever
We believe as we promise to try, that

From here we look out on forever
And we can see all that time will tell

Michael McDonald,"He came from somewhere back in her long ago
The sentimental fool don't see
Trying hard to recreate
What had yet to be created once in her life

She musters a smile
For his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize
It never really was

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
And nothing at all keeps sending him

Somewhere back in her long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere, she will return

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

Why do we look so hard?
Why do we ask so much?
In this world, it's sad in a way
How time unblesses love, and faith is lost

There's no more prayin' for saving grace to find us
No more waiting for conscience to remind us
There are few things meaningless as words
At the point of no return

Why do we want so much?
Can we be satisfied?
In this life how many times
Can we pass the promised land, forever lost?

There's no more prayin' for saving grace to find us
No more waiting for conscience to remind us
There are few things meaningless as words
At the point of no return

We are lost between faith and hope
Between heart and mind, between love and pride
Eventually, the day will come
When lies won't buy time
Tears won't bring hope
When there's no more prayin'¬°¬≠

Like a river runnin' to the sea

Starts with our believing and ends with our backs against the walls
If I'm not careful I might convince myself
This is the way it's always gonna be
Spend my whole life wonderin' just what it means to survive

So I wonder, am I strong enough?
Do I have the strength I need to carry on?
All I'm askin' for is the path that's gonna lead me home

All I need is a shinin' light an open door
I'm askin' for nothin' more than a little hope

Another mornin' strange as it seems
Here once again with all these broken things
That once hung in the balance between the extremes of my life
With the will of a runaway train

Michael McDonald,"We're lost, baby that's ok
We may not always understand
We may not always know the way
We can cry and we can hurt sometimes
But we both know what's important
At the end of the line
It's not always the case that we know just what to do
But when it comes to me and you

[Chorus:]
We've both been here before
So let love open up the door
What love will surely show us
Ain't that what we came here for?
So let love open the door

Maybe it's time that we hold on tight
In each others embrace
We might just see the morning light
'Cause when we touch
It's like a brand new start
It's there we find the music in each others heart
And we might just discover that we don't always see what's for real
Love is somethin' that you feel

We've both been here before
So let love open up the door
What love will surely show us
Ain't that what we came here for?
It ain't nothin' new
Just a chance to finally see this love through
This love has one purpose (and)
Never asks for anything more
So let love open the door

Sometimes words only mean so much
They don't say how we feel
They don't keep us in touch
It's too late once we drift apart
All that's left are the pieces of two broken hearts

[Chorus]

Amy sings...
Love is sweet, love is kind
Love will open up your mind
Let love open up the door
All that counts, nothin' more
Love is what we came here for
Let love open up the door",Open the Door
Michael McDonald,"Something deep inside keeps me hanging on 
Don't believe I've ever seen a night so long 
Guess I was trying to fly way above the clouds 
But I landed here in the morning rain 
At your doctor 

And I know I let you down again 
But right now you know I need a friend 
I don't know why I guess I just lose my way 
And your eyes don't believe a word I say 
Can't imagine without your love 
Where would I be now?

Did you ever know I've always looked up to you 
After all this time it remains true  
There's no compromise no turning back for me
But through the veil of my pride 
Sometimes it's hard to see 

And I know that your love is all I need 
When I fall don't stop believing in me 
Cause your love is what's helping me survive 
Your faith in me is what keeps my hope alive
Cause without your love 
Where would I be now?

I will prove this love is worth fighting for 
If it takes forever I will wait at your door 

Cause your love is what's helping me survive
Your faith in me is what keeps my hope alive 
Cause without your love 
Where would I be now

Michael McDonald,"You if anyone should know what time will tell
Not so long ago you taught me oh so well
Now your time has come
Someone took your place
(There's) no need to tell me that he's gone ('cause)
I can read it on your face

You learned that you could dream every night
You can try all you like
You can pray every day that it's enough
You can hope all you want
It's something to hang your faith on
But you can't make it love

There's no way love can grow
If only one is true
I would think that you should know
After all, I learned this from you
No matter how much one's in love
As long as one is lying
There ain't no amount of tears
There ain't no amount of trying

You learned that you could dream every night

Michael McDonald,"Old man winter's coming on
The nights are long and the days are gray
The fading sound of the robin's song
Summer days seem a lifetime away

It's the time that we look to each other
To raise our spirits and chase the blues away
That time of year when we all get together
I see it comin' I can hardly wait

[Chorus]
It's all right I can't stop thinking 'bout it
It's a good life no time to be sad
I feel so right every time Christmas comes around

Children's laughter and the snow on the ground
Starts lifting my heart up baby
I feel the love and the joy all around
That's how I know that it's Christmas darlin'

So glad that we've still got each other

Then how much is enough
So much for all the things we know we can't afford
I don't need any more stuff baby

Only to ask themselves why
All I need is just some mistletoe, you and i
Baby I'm satisfied right here in your arms

[Chorus]
Baby, we got a house full of love
We got a house full of love
Might not be rich enough, baby we got love
And that's all we really need
We got a house full of love

So baby come to me and sit here by the fire
And let the world rush on by
We'll find the magic of a Christmas long ago
Just like the very first time
Let everybody else lose their minds, wait in line
Only to ask themselves why
All I need is just to be with you Christmas eve
That's all the present that I'll ever need

Michael McDonald,"Old December's here at last, a time for celebration
Christmas present, Christmas past
Tumble down together like the snow, what a show

Now the snowman someone made is melting by the road side
On the wind, a serenade
Children's voices singing, I believe, I believe in us, I believe

On Christmas morning, you awaken with a smile
You hold me in your arms, we watch the snowflakes fly
And then you love me and I realize how sweet our love can be
All the memories coming back again each year on Christmas morning

Sentimental melodies surround me like an old friend
She spent the winter here with me
Silently we watched the seasons change
And they change so fast and fade away

On Christmas morning, you awaken with a smile
You hold me in your arms, we watch the snowflakes fly
And then you love me and I realize how sweet our love can be
All the memories coming back again, take me back in time

On Christmas morning, you awaken with a smile
You hold me in your arms, we watch the snowflakes fly
And then you love me and I realize how sweet our love can be
All the memories coming back again in time

Oh, Christmas morning
Oh, Christmas morning
Oh, Christmas morning

Behold I bring you tidings
Tidings of great joy

Down the road of my own mistakes

To outrun all the pain and fear
Turned to stone from my uncried tears

Would be the victory that we need

And I was wondering what it means
It looked like people had come together
As if we all believed in the same thing

It sounds like grace
Let it be in my nature
To look at my brother
And see my father's face

I want to be in the spirit
I want to be there when we cross that stream
As a people we're gonna get there
We'll find a way
To make a world out of a dream

Burn in the distance
Looks like redemption on its way
I heard a million voices
That sounded like angels
Here's what I thought I heard them say

Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me all alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through all these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
Although you're gone
I keep holding on
To those happy times
Oh, girl when you were mine

As I peer through the windows
Of lost time
Keeping looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt baby
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects a hurt I can't control

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes
My whole world has turned to dust

Reflections of
The love you took from
Reflections of
The way life used to be

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes
My whole world has turned to dust

Now baby, why did you do it?

But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,

I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, didn't I?
Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl

Michael McDonald,"Sun a-shining, there's plenty of life. . .
a new day is dawning sunny and bright.
But after I've been crying all night the sun is cold
and the new day seems old.
Since I lost my baby, since I lost my baby.

Birds are singing and the children are playing,
there's plenty of work and the bosses are paying.
Not a sad word should my young heart be saying,
but fun is a bore and with money I'm poor.
Since I lost my baby, since I lost my baby.

Next time I'll be kinder, won't you please help me find her?
Someone just remind her 'bout this love she left behind her.
'Til I find her I'll be tryin' now, ev'ry day I'm  more inclined to find her,
inclined to find her, inclined to find my baby.
Been a-looking ev'rywhere, baby, I really, really care.

Oh, determination is fading fast. . . Inspiration is a thing of the past. . .
Can't see my hope's gonna last. . .
good things are bad and what's happy is sad.
Since I lost my baby, since I lost my baby.
I feel so bad, oo, I'll feel so sad, everything is a-wrong,
I feel so bad, oo, I'll feel so sad, everything is a-wrong,",Since I Lost My Baby

Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I was hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her""

'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!

And I know I ain't going nowhere

When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there

We could not be parted.

Now, for once I can say: ""this is mine you can't take it""
As long as I've got love I know I can make it
For once in my life I've got someone who needs me
For once in my life, someone who needs me
For once in my life, someone who needs me
For once in my life, someone who needs me

Michael McDonald,"Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
She tied you
To a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

[Chorus]

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light
In every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

[Chorus]

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though
It all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

[Chorus: x4]

Hallelujah",Hallelujah
Michael McDonald,"Like a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights
Consumed by the shadows
I was crippled emotionally
Somehow I made it through the heartache
Yes I did, I escaped
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (I know you did), kept my faith

[Chorus]
When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting, I knew you were waiting for me

With an endless desire I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
Like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over, one touch and you set me free
I don't regret a single moment, no I don't looking hack
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (I know you do), I just laugh

[Chorus]

So we were drawn together through destiny
I know this love we shared was meant to be
I knew you were waiting, I, I knew you were waiting
I knew you were waiting, knew you were waiting for me

I did not falter when the mountain was high
I still believed when the valley was low
It did not stop me I knew you were waiting, I knew you were waiting for me
When the mountain was high, knew you were waiting
When the valley was low, I knew it baby, I knew it baby
I knew you were waiting, I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me
I cant not falter, when the mountain was high
I still believed when the valley was low
It did not stop me
Cause I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me
When the mountain was high
When the valley was low...",I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)
Michael McDonald,"We were born before the wind
Also younger than the sun
Ere the bonnie boat was won as we sailed into the mystic
Hark, now hear the sailors cry
Smell the sea and feel the sky
Let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic

And when that fog horn blows I will be coming home
And when the fog horn blows I want to hear it
I don't have to fear it

Cause I want to rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
Then magnificently we will flow into the mystic

Can you hear it
Come on girl

And when that fog horn blows you know I will be coming home

Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty
His parents give him love and affection
To keep him strong moving in the right direction
Living just enough, just enough for the city...

And you can bet he hardly makes a dollar
His mother goes to scrub the floor for many
And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny

His sister's black but she is sho 'nuff pretty
Her skirt is short but Lord her legs are sturdy
To walk to school she's got to get up early
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty
Living just enough, just enough for the city...

Her brother's smart he's got more sense than many
His patience's long but soon he won't have any
To find a job is like a haystack needle
Cause where he lives they don't use colored people
Living just enough, just enough for the city...
Living just enough...
For the city...

His hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty
He spends his love walking the streets of New York City
He's almost dead from breathing on air pollution
He tried to vote but to him there's no solution
Living just enough, just enough for the city...

And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow
This place is cruel no where could be much colder

Michael McDonald,"Thinking back over my years I guess I shedded some tears
Told myself time and time again 'This time I'm gonna win'

Think I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O.
Think I'd better let it go

Tried to take control of love, love took control of me

This lonely room just echoes
Telling me you're gone

Each night in my dreams
You're back in my arms
Still here in my arms
Like you used to be
But each morning I awake
And I face reality
I'm still not over you
Getting over me

A foolish heart, like mine
Will always take for granted
That precious love like yours
Will wait till I come back

But too many times
I turned away
Leaving you to cry alone
But with every tear I'm learning
All the ways that I was wrong

When you said goodbye

Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here

Running over the same old ground

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Smoke screen
Hiding the enemy's scheme
Smoke screen
Clouding our hopes and our dreams
Smoke screen
The truth ain't as bad as it seems
But the last scene is sure to be making you scream

If we surrender we die
So don't try
Living a lie

Hiding the enemy's scheme
Smoke screen
Clouding our hopes and our dreams

The truth ain't as bad as it seems
But the last scene
Is sure to be making you scream",Smoke Screen
