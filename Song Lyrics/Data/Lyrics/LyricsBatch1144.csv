Running Wild,"Poisoned snakes with doubled tongues, pretend to know the law
They menace with eternal hell, the fiend on velvet paws
They saw what you should do or not, to keep you just in line
Praying they will fool the blind till the end of time

Fight the fire, the licking flame of hate
Fight the liar, the snake in the shade

He spites his wicked lies, the poison
He slithers, round his victim till he bites
He injects the fuel of hate, the poison
And the fallen angel spreads his blackened wings

They pray the wine, they serve the lie, that's dripping in your ears
They daze your mind, they need your soul to oil their evil gear
A mindless and obedient slave to the lord of flies
Their hearts are wrapped in blackest night, cashing in on lies

The evilness lives in their heart, Lucifer's the name
They bet your life, your soul's the prize, the pool in the game
They say they saw the god of light, but they will never proof
I know their god, they're praying to, two horns and cloven hoof",The Poison
Running Wild,"The fight of light & darkness put the test on you
The pain of tribulation is what you're going through
Determination is on you, cause fate's in your own hand
The power of seduction is the test you have to stand

Days of war and thunder, that's what the dark lives on
A fast trip on a one-way until all good is gone
They love to see you falling, to save their binding spell
You're on a suicide mission, a final trip to hell

Death is calling, unerring destiny
Black heart's falling, for all eternity

Resurrection, the soul survivors stand
Chain-reaction, but the good at heart will stand the hand of fate

So see the whole connection, between all things they do
They try to daze your senses, cause the evil's never true
They promise you their heaven, they're giving you their hell
A ticket to damnation is what these people sell

Pre...

Chorus...",Resurrection
Running Wild,"Only when the last dragonslayer has been laid by the heels
And his demonic soul is melting in the holy flames of eternal truth
The dragons kingdom will return to free the enslaved soul
From his shackles of hate
That will be the time, when the Serpent looses its tongue and its head!!

The kiss of the Serpent brings darkness and torment
They fight the defender with treason and slander
Seducing to blindness, souls' getting mindless
They're slaying the dragon, they're hunting the pagan

When the unerring law of the dragon returns, to wipe away all the pain
The Serpent is banned and the soulless will burn, the roof of all evil to tame

No resurrection with evil's attraction
Denying its spell, might save you from hell

The death of all badness brings the end of all madness
He rides the wind on silent wings, laser beams ripping steel
Black helicopters go up in flames, before they know that he's real

Firebreather, raging from the stormy sky
Firebreather, smoke and thunder steal the light away",Return of the Dragon
Running Wild,"Since all time began the holy council guards the light
They saw dawn of man, made by gods to serve their pride
Their slave, he fell from grace, he became the renegade
But evilness took place, cause a darkened force lurked in the shade

Silent wings of black, shadowed all the good at heart
The snake on the attack, shot to bite right off dark
The poison in their vein, freezed their soul, their heart, their mind
So they praised the evil's name, the beast to serve, the world to grind

Time of all eternity, can never change the final destiny
The purified that stood the fight, will be saved to see the world of light

The rivalry, since eternity, the final fight the blackened world to free
Lost in hate, determined fate, all evil's damned to walk the fiery gate

The time is right at hand, to see the truth behind the lie
Decade of evils end, the poisoned heart is doomed to die
The chosen one is here, they're in a deadly fix
He is the one they fear, cause he is up to all their tricks

Time of all eternity, can never change the final destiny
The purified that stood the fight, will be saved to see the world of light

The rivalry, since eternity, the final fight the blackened world to free
Lost in hate, determined fate, all evil's damned to walk the fiery gate",The Rivalry
Running Wild,"The rifles are firing, the cracking of guns break the still
The march of the soldiers, no mercy, no thoughts and no will

They fall one by one, their blood is shed without sense
Trapped in the spell of a nightmare

War & peace, you're walking just straight on the edge
War & peace, you're dying in war, but you even can't live in peace

You gun down your victim and the devil is laughing in scorn
You're killing your brother, cause he's wearing the wrong uniform

They fall one by one, their blood is shed without sense
Trapped in the spell of a nightmare

War & peace, you're walking just straight on the edge
War & peace, you're dying in war, but you even can't live in peace

The essence of all evil is living on madness and hate
So see and take over, to rule the key to your fate

They fall one by one, their blood is shed without sense
Trapped in the spell of a nightmare

War & peace, you're walking just straight on the edge
War & peace, you're dying in war, but you even can't live in peace",War and Peace
Running Wild,"Creation of the guardian, the force of dark and light
Two souls to rule the elements to fight a constant fight
One soul to save the light, one soul to serve the dark
Rivals to eternity, the savior and the shark

Before the darkness, before the light
The guardians' soul stood the sands of time
He ruled the void, he ruled the dark
All came to birth, the holy spark

Watch out, be strong, choose! when the war is on
Watch out, time's long, until all evil is gone

Rise or fall, standing proud or losing all
Die or live, destruction takes and freedom gives

He watches dark, he watches light
Two souls to proof, wrong or right
A constant fight, a war foretold
A settled plan, what future holds

Running Wild,"Mordant wall of smoke, barrels glow, shot their load
Gunfire takes your breath, balls of lead causing death
Thunderstorm breaks loose, the slaughter's son, life's on the loose
Sounding the attack, soldiers fall, back to back

The roaring horde is near, pounding hooves, mortal fear
The soldiers bravely stand, they try hard to defend

Till the end!

Riding the attack
Yelling screams of the fallen
Thunder, blood and pain
Madness reigns, hell is calling now

Thunder shakes the ground, a deadly force, pound by pound
Frightened, nerves are blank, horseman ride, hit the flank
Cold sweat down their neck, death will ride one last attack
Fearsome battle cry, flashing guns, soldiers die

Tell me why!

Chorus

Horror, death and pain, the devil smiles, so what's the gain?
Stretching out his claw to feed his laughing greedy jaw

Greedy jaw!

Chorus",The Hussar
Running Wild,"Here comes the finale, time to pay your dues
A law without mercy, you have to take the truth
No worldly powers could force the fate
Universal judgment of the highest grade

Time's right to find out if you're wrong or right
Time is running short now, beware the law will strike
Evil souls are fading in the flames
No more lies and no more games

Into the fire
Blackened hearts will burn
Into the fire
The flames of no return

Drop all your blindness and your soul could last
Being proud and headstrong means you'll dying fast
Drowning in the fires your sad and final price
Melting in the pyre to burn away your lies

Into the fire
Blackened hearts will burn
Into the fire
The flames of no return

The true and final judgment is about to come
They are judge and jury, they are all in one
Deviding good from evil, deviding truth from lie
A case of survival or a ""Go to hell and die!""

Time's right to find out if you're wrong or right
Time is running short now, beware the law will strike

The flames of no return",Into the Fire
Running Wild,"Ruling the stars, invisible watchers
Since the beginning of time
A mighty weapon, the cosmical gender
Defending the truth and its sign

The falling of stars, the pain of its children
It's time for the gods to return
Hunting the serpent, erasing its madness
The structure of evil to burn

Holy laws to set their course
Wings of steel, a force so real

The final fight, the force of light
The fiend to ban, to rule again

The gods will return, all evil to burn
Striking the underworlds' lair
To take back their crown, the terror to drown
Sons of the sun in its glare

The gods will return, the evil will learn
persistence is ruling their fight
The evil's on flame, erasing its name
They are standing in pride with their shimmering armor of light

Running Wild,"Did you ever see shoes are lying in the streets?
Brand new clothing, a pilgrim with no deeds? No way!

Did you ever think, who would throw it away?
A case of confusion? Madness on its way?

Silence, dead of the night
Killers, lurking behind

Darkness falls, the serpent strikes
A secret calls in the mask of the night

Why should it happen a hundred times a year?
A secret behind that should rouse our fear?

Millions of people disappearing year by year
Leaving no trace or did they just go out of here?
Long told stories tell a blackened man awaits

Running Wild,"At the day of his coronation
He sank down in deepest despair
Hundreds of Russians were dying
By rapture, the sun and its glare

After several years of waiting
He came, the heir to the throne
Their son was born as a bleeder
His parents so sad and alone

The tsarina felt what was coming
A vision that darkened her soul
The tsar was given a warning
Intrigues so darkened and cold

Destiny called, the empire fell
The two-headed eagle that died
Bullets of hate were erasing their lifes
No prayer and nobody cried

In their darkest hour the ""staretz"" appeared
He saved Aleksej from death
Rasputins' power, a dissolute life
Sentenced to take his last breath

The world was on war, drowning in flames
Gasbombs, horror and death

The reds brought on revolution
He decided to take his discharge
But they placed him under detention
The red star, its idols should march
The Romanows took up their cross

Running Wild,"The gods of past and future, returning from the sky
Defenders of the holy, they are soaring on high
All slaves of evils' kingdom, dropping down like flies
The final raging battle that's when the evil dies

The poison of illusion, the world falls asleep
The evil reigns its kingdom by cunning and deceit
The force of seduction, chaos in the game
Man is trapped in blindness, praising Dorkas' name

Darkness falls and light will rise
The force of judgment finally strikes

Victory

Self destructive mankind's like wax in his hands
War and plain destruction are fit to set an end
A vulnerable system to serve the evil's way
Raising all its madness until the final day

Terror reigns in the prophecy
""Babylon"" will fall, so plain to foresee
A nightmare rules the mirage of gold
Slipping to damnation by trying to hold

The final hours of the world we see
Here! Fate is calling

Time! Is running short now
To find out if mankind's fit to learn
Down! Soul-destruction
If pride is blind and stuns the will to turn

The final hours, the final night
The final trial if you'll stand the light

When time runs out
When the sky comes down
When the ball will burst
When it shakes the ground down to the core

War! The bombs are falling
Brother kills thy brother endlessly
Death! Massive destruction

In the end now the deuce must be paid

Don't try to run before you walk
You have to think before you talk
C'mon and open up your mind
Before the truth walks out of sight

All your life through they teach you right from wrong
Can you trust 'em? Or is the truth yet gone?
In the darkness when the fight begins
Your soul's telling virtue from sin

Is the truth out there? Or is it still inside?

Who teach you dark from light? YOU!

Doing dirty deeds under the churchbell's peal

This flight is sailing through the see

And the blue heavens
The homeland appears like a developing photograph
Through the mists as I return to land
I see Scotland of the high mountains
And the empty acres
Flying low across the moorland lochs
The forests and the glens
But it's
A wounding and a hollow sight
Here as we reach the end of the century
The beautiful soil of the people
Still in the hands of the few
I see the wheels of industry at a standstill
And the northern lands wasted
And the empty house in Edinburgh

House upon house
Till there be nowhere for you to be placed alone
In the midst of all the earth

As I welcome the warmth

Out of work out of money, prospects bleak
Now the plane comes down from the morning sky
And you touch the land where the fire won't die
Johnny, you're home, man
It's a long road
You drove us down
It's only a moment
Since the diesels turned
Now the blade cuts clean through the island soil
The years roll back and the world grows small
You stand on the banks in the wind and the rain
And all of your money now can't hide this pain
So you hold your mother and you bless the air
With the tears of the emigrant, tongue of the Gael
And the plane takes off in a clear blue sky

Now you search the open evening sky
Trace the memory in your eyes
For the prophet's hard rain and the deluge
Lie in tears around your door
Once there were trees and livestock here
A mother's love, the warnings clear
But you chose to turn away from fear
Breathing free
Now there's a faceless cross on a distant hill
A wasted voice, a silent scream
Where the lovers love and the dreamers dream
You stand and dream alone
You took your sacrifice to the gods of war
Traded your children's lives for a mess of gold
And you beat your ploughshares into swords

And the one apple
That is beyond reach
Who amongst us
Can exist a single day
Beyond our own time and our own limits
Countless and
Futile
Are times I've climbed
To reach and taste
The forbidden fruit
The winds will blow
And the sun will shine
From generation to generation
Through the trees of the garden
But the day and the hour
Will surely come
To take the highest apple
From the knowledge tree

Enchanted ballrooms where I lost my life
I've closed my eyes
On your fairground smile
Seedy heroes and silver tills
Sinking suns on a sea of thrills
I place my bets
Trading with strangers in silhouette
I drink your health, son of the earth
Passing ships in the modern death
We're all still fired
Old emotions still burn inside
On solid ground, round the mother tongue
A tower of hope, a joyful sound
You take your time
A hand of aces in a pack of lies
I found my song and I started to sing
Took me away on an olden wing
So far from home
Standing so lonely but not alone
In this empire of ache and rhyme

That draws me near

Every stone on every wall
But here in our land how can we stand
And wash our hands of shame
When the sins of generations fall

Across the green like rain
Here one world window opens wide
And demons they show face

To where my footprints were scattered
On their journey through the dust
From the beginning to an end of time
And to the bright everlasting days

To a barren wilderness
And you raised the shadow

We will praise

So lowly beneath the sun

I've kept this inside for too long
And it's driving me crazy
I wanna dance with you

Gotta do this now before it's too late
Even if I tempt my own fate
I've kept this inside for too long
And it's driving me crazy
I wanna dance with you

[Chorus]

Give me the chance
You won't regret
Cause when we dance
I'll make you wet
Just the two of us
All night long
One on one

Give me the chance
You won't regret
Cause when we dance
I'll make you wet
Just the two of us
All night long
One on one

",Bonus Track: Jump
Rupee,"Guilty are the feelings that you and I share inside
Though we both love somebody else we cannot hide
This love this passion this pain and this pride

Unfaithful even though we know what we do is so wrong
This love we hide inside it is so strong
We keep on letting go and holding on

How long can we keep going without this love from showing?
And everybody knowing we've got so much to lose
But someday we must choose

It's not that we're unhappy, we love our lovers dearly
Could somebody please tell me?
If this love is so wrong why does it feel so strong?

Why is love the crime of the century?
So many of us here are guilty
Those without sin cast your stone on me
Why is love the crime of the century?

Happy in both of our relationships at home
I can tell when I creep and call you on the phone
And hear you softly speak and softly moan

Nonsense, you can't love two people at the same time
Are we the only ones guilty of this crime?
Look and you'll be surprised at what you find

Why is love the crime of the century?
So many of us here are guilty
Those without sin cast your stone on me
Why is love the crime of the century?

No matter how we try we can't let this thing go
So until they find out we'll keep it on the low

Why is love the crime of the century?
So many of us here are guilty
Those without sin cast your stone on me
Why is love the crime of the century?

Rupee,"[Verse 1]
Many nights we would sit down and cry
Tears from mine would be tears from your eye
What they saw it was a human disguise
To fulfill their demise
Couldn't hear our inner cries
How he used to love you
How he used to treat you
Said he'd never leave you
How he used to beat you
He was lost but woman I can say
Yes I've been blessed
By the almighty
Always confide in me
Never try to hide from me
Keep it inside from me

Me sing woman I'll always be there for you
Woman no matter what them try to do

Woman no matter what them try to do
Woman you turn all my gray skies blue
Love you now
Love you now

[Verse 2]
On your shoulder yes the burden is great
For something so precious how could man show hate
Yes to elevate man that is to educate
But they say that love is blind
And if you seek then you will find
It's not about intelligence
It's not about the expense
It's not about the experience of revealing ones innocence
It's about the air you breathe inside of me
To all mankind and to all them baby
Yes I'll always love you
Always protect you
Yes I'll always shelter you

No yellow heart
No shattered image to fall apart
As the Earth starts to crumble he will fly like a dart

From the deepest cave
Through the rocks that tumble
To the highest mountain
Where he will be saved

No lamb to the slaughter
He's a man unchained
No broken spirit
No yellow heart

No earthly limits, no water mark
When the fires engulf the jungle
He will slice through a path
For the smoke recoils

And he walks right through the flames
Onto the troubled seas
And back again 
No broken spirit

No yellow heart
No shattered image to fall apart

No broken spirit, no hidden motives

No yellow heart, no starving soul
No shattered image, no tighter order
To fall apart
This is control

The dagger of desire only scratched this man of steel
God knows if it goes too deep
It's a three-sided slit that never heals in the heat

Rupert Holmes,"I've come back this morning
To where I first came alive
Here within this terminal
Where the buses arrive

I was a commuter on the 804
Worked for a computer
On the 19th floor and

You came down the aisle of the bus
And you sat by my side
Shoulder up to shoulder
We shared that 9 o'clock ride

Oh my heart was screaming
As you left your seat
Following your movements
I was at your feet and

Oh... down into the terminal
Both of us smiled
So... we entered the terminal
Just as you smiled

""Won't you leave out work for today?""
You asked of me then
So I phoned in sick on the way
To the home of a friend

We were all alone from 10 a.m. till 3
Really thought the fire
Had gone out of me but

You awoke the sleep of my life
From gray into red
Made the weary wonder of Wall Street
Rise from the dead

Could have held up
Budding my entire life
But I had to get home
To the kids and the wife and so

I left for the terminal where I began
Baby no, I wouldn't have left
If I'd been half a man

So here I am this morning
Where love had asked for the dance
Here within this terminal
Where I passed on the chance

Lord I'll never find her
Though I've truly tried
Probably she's found another
Bus to ride and

I am now about to begin
The last of my days
I'm within what others
Would call a terminal phase

I myself can only say it's livin' dead
Riding to the office with
A song in my head that goes...

La da da...
And you know it grows
La da da...",Terminal

Where the rules just don't exist
Give no mind and give no name
No one knows whose taking the blame

C'mon let's get crazy tonight
No time to worry if we're wrong or we're right

Rupert Holmes,"I can make a speech
When the mood comes to me, yes it's true
But oh pretty darlin'
I am speechless when it comes to you

Speechless when you reach for my hand
I am so speechless and I can't understand how you love me
But as long as you keep sayin' that you love me
There is nothin' I can say

Except I am speechless at the sound of your voice
I am so speechless and since I have no choice
I keep smilin' like a cat whose caught a bird
And just keep smilin'

If I dare to say a word, you'd find me mindless
And I don't really mind, love is blindness
And my mind is resigned to the kindness you keep pourin' on me
Can it be? Can it be? Can it be all for me?

I don't have a hope
If you don't dream of me, this is true
Cause oh pretty darlin'
I am hopeless when I dream of you

Speechless and the heart never lies
I am so speechless so I speak with my eyes
I am just smilin' 'cause I've seen [?]
Oh, are you smilin' at my face within the darkness

When I am breathless and I come up for air
It's so endless that it gives me a scare
It's so timeless that I never touch ground
Why should I? Why should I? Why should I make a sound

I can sing your song
I can sigh in the night, this is true
But oh pretty darlin'
I am speechless at the sight of you",Speechless
Rupert Holmes,"A little while ago I went and placed a call
To tell this girl I know that she could have it all
The wedding, the ring, the whole darn thing, I was willing to tie the knot
So I called her up, and this is the answer I got:

[Chorus]
""I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine,
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know the whole routine.
Leave your name and number, and I'll try to get back to you;
You have 30 seconds to talk to me before you're through.""

And I said,
""Baby let's go get married, I need to hear you're mine.
I am hanging on, I am hanging on, I am hanging on this line.
And if I can leave one message before you go to bed,
I would say to you...:""

And the phone went dead.

So I stepped out to buy some dog food for the cat.
Of course she called about three minutes after that.
Would she be my wife and share my life? Well of course you can write the
Plot,
Cause she called me up, and this is the answer she got:

[Chorus]

And she said,
""Baby I got your message, I am answering your call.
I have thought it out, I have thought it out, and I think that, all-in-all
If you ask if we can marry, and make it for all time,
Then my answer is, ""

And the phone went,

""I'm so sorry, you have just reached my answering machine...""",Answering Machine

Ain't got one damn thing to do with me and you

Why not blow a wad of dough
And see the world at large?

She can stretch it if you know what I mean

Where they're not known very well
'Cause they never stay beyond 2:15

And runs a brush through her hair

They run for both of their lives
Out to the Piper Club Motel that they call home
Then back to Terminal 2

Rupert Holmes,"If you take these glasses from my face
Think that you would find
I'm undeniably, certifiably just a shade of blind

I don't envy those of you with 20/20 vision
Who've seen the world for all its worth
With crystal clear precision

There's more to see than can be
Seen or said than what is heard
The day is brighter, softer, lighter
When it's slightly blurred

Nearsighted, it's another lovely day
Nearsighted, so I stumble on my way

I don't judge a friend or lover
By a first or second look
Nor a book just by its cover
I can't even see the book

Nearsighted, loving life is such a breeze
Nearsighted 'cause I see just what I please

And it pleases me to see you
I won't change my point of view
Nearsighted, nearsighted
Nearsighted, all I need to see is you

Though I'm slightly out of focus
I can see my dreams come true
Clear sighted, I'm nearsighted
Nearsighted, all I need to see is you, you

Rupert Holmes,"I was tired of my lady, we´d been together too long
Like a worn-out recording, of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping, I read the paper in bed
And in the personals column, there was this letter I read

""If you like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain
If you´re not into yoga, if you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape
I´m the love that you´ve looked for, write to me, and escape""

I didn´t think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady, had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad
And though I´m nobody´s poet, I thought it wasn´t half bad

""Yes, I like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain
I´m not much into health food, I am into champagne
I´ve got to meet you by tomorrow noon, and cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's, where we´ll plan our escape""

So I waited with high hopes, then she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady, and she said, ""Oh, it´s you""
And we laughed for a moment, and I said, ""I never knew""

""That you liked Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean, and the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape
You´re the love that I´ve looked for, come with me, and escape""

Approaches the unreal
For those who think and feel
In touch with some reality
Beyond the gilded cage

Cast in this unlikely role
Ill-equipped to act
With insufficient tact
One must put up barriers
To keep oneself intact

Living in the limelight
The universal dream
For those who wish to seem
Those who wish to be
Must put aside the alienation
Get on with the fascination
The real relation
The underlying theme

Living in a fish eye lens
Caught in the camera eye
I have no heart to lie
I can't pretend a stranger
Is a long-awaited friend

All the world's indeed a stage
And we are merely players
Performers and portrayers
Each another's audience
Outside the gilded cage

Living in the limelight
The universal dream
For those who wish to seem
Those who wish to be
Must put aside the alienation
Get on with the fascination

Mean, mean stride
Today's Tom Sawyer
Mean, mean pride

Though his mind is not for rent
Don't put him down as arrogant
He reserves the quiet defense
Riding out the day's events
The river

What you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the mist, catch the myth
Catch the mystery, catch the drift

The world is, the world is
Love and life are deep
Maybe as his skies are wide

Today's Tom Sawyer
He gets by on you
And the space he invades
He gets by on you

No, his mind is not for rent
To any God or government
Always hopeful yet discontent
He knows changes aren't permanent
But change is

What you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the witness, catch the wit
Catch the spirit, catch the spit

Drinking by the lighthouse, smoking on the pier
Still we saw the magic was fading every year

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch

What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

It's not somebody who's seen the light

Rush,"There is unrest in the forest
There is trouble with the trees
For the maples want more sunlight
And the oaks ignore their pleas 

The trouble with the maples
And they're quite convinced they're right
They say the oaks are just too lofty
And they grab up all the light
But the oaks can't help their feelings
If they like the way they're made
And they wonder why the maples
Can't be happy in their shade? 

There is trouble in the forest
And the creatures all have fled
As the maples scream 'oppression!'
And the oaks, just shake their heads 

So the maples formed a union
And demanded equal rights
'The oaks are just too greedy
We will make them give us light'
Now there's no more oak oppression
For they passed a noble law

In geometric order
An insulated border
In-between the bright lights
And the far, unlit unknown

Opinions all provided
The future pre-decided
Detached and subdivided
In the mass-production zone

Nowhere is the dreamer
Or the misfit so alone

Subdivisions
In the high school halls
In the shopping malls
Conform or be cast out
Subdivisions
In the basement bars
In the backs of cars
Be cool or be cast out
Any escape might help to smooth
The unattractive truth
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe
The restless dreams of youth

Drawn like moths, we drift into the city
The timeless old attraction
Cruising for the action
Lit up like a firefly
Just to feel the living night

Some will sell their dreams for small desires
Or lose the race to rats
Get caught in ticking traps
And start to dream of somewhere
To relax their restless flight

Somewhere out of a memory
Of lighted streets on quiet nights","Subdivisions [Live Birmingham England, 1988]"

In geometric order
An insulated border
In-between the bright lights
And the far, unlit unknown

Growing up, it all seems so one-sided
Opinions all provided
The future pre-decided
Detached and subdivided
In the mass-production zone

Nowhere is the dreamer
Or the misfit so alone

Subdivisions
In the high school halls
In the shopping malls
Conform or be cast out
Subdivisions
In the basement bars
In the backs of cars
Be cool or be cast out

Any escape might help to smooth
The unattractive truth
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe
The restless dreams of youth

Drawn like moths, we drift into the city
The timeless old attraction
Cruising for the action
Lit up like a firefly
Just to feel the living night

Some will sell their dreams for small desires
Or lose the race to rats
Get caught in ticking traps
And start to dream of somewhere
To relax their restless flight

Somewhere out of a memory
Of lighted streets on quiet nights

In the high school halls
In the shopping malls

Nothing to lose, maybe I had something to trade
The way the big wheel spins

I placed no trust in a faith that was ready-made
Take no chances on paradise delayed
So I do a slow fade 

Playing for time
Don't want to wait for heaven
Looking for love
For an angel to forgive my sins
Playing with fire
Chasing something new to believe in
Looking for love
The way the big wheel spins 

Well, I was only a kid, cruising around in a trance
Prisoner of fate, victim of circumstance
I was lined up for glory, but the tickets sold out in advance
The way the big wheel spins 

Well, I was only a kid, gone without a backward glance
Going for broke, going for another chance
Hoping for heaven, hoping for a fine romance
If I do the right dance 

Wheel goes round, landing on a twist of faith

Parade from paradise
End the need for Eden
Chase the dreams of merchandise

Leaders make a deal
The cosmic is largely comic
A con they couldn't conceal

There is no safe seat at the feast
Take your best stab at the beast
The night is turning thin
The saint is turning to sin

Raise the art to resistance
Danger dare to be grand
Pride reduced to humble pie
Diamonds down to sand

Take heart from earth and weather
The brightness of new birth
Take heart from the harvest
Shave the harvest from the earth

There is no safe seat at the feast
Take your best stab at the beast
The night is turning thin
The saint is turning to sin

Reasoning is partly insane
Image just an eyeless game
The night is turning thin
The saint is turning to sin

Miracles will have their claimers
More will bow to Rome
He and she are in the house
But there's only me at home

Rose is a rose of splendor
Posed to respond in the end
Lonely things like nights, I find
End finer with a friend

I hear in the rate of her heart
A tear in the heat of the art
The night is turning thin
The saint is turning to sin

There is no safe seat at the feast
Take your best stab at the beast

Has the trees in constant motion
With a flash of silver leaves

Stuck between his teeth
A vague sensation quickens
In his young and restless heart
And a bright and nameless vision
Has him longing to depart

Autumn woods and winter skies
You move me
You move me
Open sea and city lights
Busy streets and dizzy heights
You call me
You call me

The fawn-eyed girl with sun-browned legs
Dances on the edge of his dream
And her voice rings in his ears
Like the music of the spheres

The boy lies in the grass, unmoving
Staring at the sky
His mother starts to call him
As a hawk goes soaring by
The boy pulls down his baseball cap
And covers up his eyes

You move me

With your buildings and your eyes
Autumn woods and winter skies
You move me

Open sea and city lights
Busy streets and dizzy heights

""I lie awake, staring out at the bleakness of Megadon. City and sky become one, merging into a single plane, a vast sea of unbroken grey. The Twin Moons, just two pale orbs as they trace their way across the steely sky. I used to think I had a pretty good life here, just plugging into my machine for the day, then watching Templevision or reading a Temple Paper in the evening.

My friend Jon always said it was nicer here than under the atmospheric domes of the Outer Planets. We have had peace since 2062, when the surviving planets were banded together under the Red Star of the Solar Federation. The less fortunate gave us a few new moons.

I believed what I was told. I thought it was a good life, I thought I was happy. Then I found something that changed it all...""

III. DISCOVERY
-------------------------------------------------------------

... ""Behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave, I found it. I brushed away the dust of the years, and picked it up, holding it reverently in my hands. I had no idea what it might be, but it was beautiful"" ...

... ""I learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn the keys to make them sound differently. As I struck the wires with my other hand, I produced my first harmonious sounds, and soon my own music! How different it could be from the music of the Temples! I can't wait to tell the priests about it! ...""

What can this strange device be?
When I touch it, it gives forth a sound
It's got wires that vibrate and give music
What can this thing be that I found?

See how it sings like a sad heart
And joyously screams out its pain
Chords that build high like a mountain
Or notes that fall gently like rain.

I can't wait to share this new wonder
The people will all see its light
Let them all make their own music
The Priests praise my name on this night.

IV. PRESENTATION
-------------------------------------------------------------

... ""In the sudden silence as I finished playing, I looked up to a circle of grim, expressionless faces. Father Brown rose to his feet, and his somnolent voice echoed throughout the silent Temple Hall."" ...

... ""Instead of the grateful joy that I expected, they were words of quiet rejection! Instead of praise, sullen dismissal. I watched in shock and horror as Father Brown ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feet...""

I know it's most unusual
To come before you so
But I've found an ancient miracle
I thought that you should know

Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you.

The Priests:

Yes, we know it's nothing new
It's just a waste of time
We have no need for ancient ways
The world is doing fine

Another toy will help destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan.

I can't believe you're saying
These things just can't be true
Our world could use this beauty
Just think what we might do.

Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you.

The Priests:

Don't annoy us further
We have our work to do.
Just think about the average
What use have they for you?

Another toy will help destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan.

V. ORACLE: THE DREAM
-------------------------------------------------------------

... ""I guess it was a dream, but even now it all seems so vivid to me. Clearly yet I see the beckoning hand of the oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase"" ...

... ""I see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure spirit of man revealed in the lives and works of this world. I was overwhelmed by both wonder and understanding as I saw a completely different way to life, a way that had been crushed by the Federation long ago. I saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things ...""

I wandered home though the silent streets
And fell into a fitful sleep
Escape to realms beyond the night
Dream can't you show me the light?

I stand atop a spiral stair
An oracle confronts me there
He leads me on light years away
Through astral nights, galactic days

I see the works of gifted hands
That grace this strange and wondrous land
I see the hand of man arise
With hungry mind and open eyes

They left the planet long ago
The elder race still learn and grow
Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the home where they belong
Home, to tear the Temples down...
Home, to change..

I can no longer live under the control of the Federation, but there is no other place to go. My last hope is that with my death I may pass into the world of my dream, and know peace at last.""

The sleep is still in my eyes
The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
And lie a while in bed
I wish that it might come to pass
Not fade like all my dreams

Just think of what my life might be
In a world like I have seen
I don't think I can carry on
Carry on this cold and empty life
Oh...no

My spirits are low in the depths of despair
My lifeblood spills over..

Rush,"To seek the sacred river Alph 
To walk the caves of ice 
To break my fast on honey dew 
And drink the milk of paradise 

I had heard the whispered tales
Of immortality
The deepest mystery
From an ancient book, I took a clue
I scaled the frozen mountain tops
Of eastern lands unknown
Time and man alone
Searching for the lost, Xanadu 

Xanadu

To stand within the pleasure dome 
Decreed by Kubla Khan 
To taste anew the fruits of life 
The last immortal man 
To find the sacred river Alph 
To walk the caves of ice 
Oh, I will dine on honey dew 
And drink the milk of paradise, oh paradise

A thousand years have come and gone
But time has passed me by
Stars stopped in the sky
Frozen in an everlasting view
Waiting for the world to end
Weary of the night
Praying for the light
Prison of the lost, Xanadu 

Xanadu

Held within the pleasure dome 
Decreed by Kubla Khan 
To taste my bitter triumph 
As a mad immortal man 
Never more shall I return 
Escape these caves of ice 
For I have dined on honey dew 
And drunk the milk of paradise, whoa paradise",Xanadu
Rush,"It's not how fast you can go
The force goes into the flow
If you pick up the beat
You can forget about the heat
More than just survival
More than just a flash
More than just a dotted line
More than just a dash

It's a test of ultimate will
The heartbreak climb uphill
Got to pick up the pace
If you want to stay in the race
More than blind ambition
More than simple greed
More than a finish line
(More than a finish line)
Must feed this burnin' need
(Must feed this burnin' need)
In the long run

From first to last
Peak is never passed
Somethin' always fires the light
That gets in your eyes
One moment's high
And glory rolls on by
Like a streak of lightning
That flashes and fades
In the summer sky

Your meters may overload
You can rest at the side of the road
You can miss a stride
But nobody gets a free ride
More than high performance
More than just a spark
More than just the bottom line
Or a lucky shot in the dark
In the long run

From first to last
Peak is never passed
Somethin' always fires the light
That gets in your eyes
One moment's high
And glory rolls on by
Like a streak of lightning
That flashes and fades
In the summer sky

You can do a lot in a lifetime
If you don't burn out too fast
You can make the most of the distance
First you need endurance
First you've got to last

From first to last
Peak is never passed
Somethin' always fires that light
That gets in your eyes
One moment's high
And glory rolls on by
Like a streak of lightning
That flashes and fades
In the summer sky

From first to last
Peak is never passed
Somethin' always fires the light
That gets in your eyes
One moment's high
And glory rolls on by
Like a streak of lightning
That flashes and fades

Rush,"We've got nothing to fear but fear itself
Not pain, not failure, not fatal tragedy?
Not the faulty units in this mad machinery?
Not the broken contacts in emotional chemistry?

In the glory game on the power train

And those who push us down that they might climb
Is any killer worth more than his crime?
Like a steely blade in a silken sheath

They live for the things they're afraid of

Rush,"The snakes and arrows a child is heir to
Are enough to leave a thousand cuts
We build our defenses, a place of safety
And leave the darker places unexplored

Sometimes the fortress is too strong
Or the love is too weak
What should have been our armor
Becomes a sharp and angry sword

Our better natures seek elevation
A refuge for the coming night

No one

We hold beliefs as a consolation
A way to take us out of ourselves
Meditation or medication
A comfort or a promised reward

Sometimes the spirit is too strong
Or the flesh is too weak
Sometimes the need is just too great
For the solace we seek
The suit of shining armor
Becomes a keen and bloody sword
No one gets to their heaven without a fight

A refuge for the coming night
A future of eternal light
No one gets to their heaven without a fight
No one

Confused alarms of struggle and flight
Blood is drained of color
By the flashes of artillery light
No one gets to their heaven without a fight
The battle flags are flown
At the feet of a god unknown
No one gets to their heaven...
No one gets to their heaven without a fight

Sometimes the damage is too great
Or the will is too weak
What should have been our armor
Becomes a sharp and burning sword

I like that song about this wonderful world
It's got a sunny point of view
And sometimes I feel it's true
At least for a few of us
I like that world; it makes a wonderful song
But there's a darker point of view
But sadly just as true
For so many among us

Though we might have precious little
It's still precious

In the strongest man there's a child so weak
In the whole wide world there's no magic place
So you might as well rise, put on your bravest face
Put on your bravest face

I like that show where they solve all the murders
An heroic point of view
It's got justice and vengeance too

I like that story; makes a satisfying case
But there's a messy point of view
That's sadly just as true
For so many among us

Their faces closed tight
An angular mass of New Yorkers
Pacing in rhythm
Race the oncoming night
They chase through the streets of Manhattan
Head-first humanity
Pause at a light
Then flow through the streets of the city 

They seem oblivious 
To a soft spring rain 
Like an English rain 
So light, yet endless 
From a leaden sky, yeah

The buildings are lost 
In their limitless rise 
My feet catch the pulse 
And the purposeful stride 

I feel the sense of possibilities
I feel the wrench of hard realities
The focus is sharp in the city 

Wide-angle watcher
On life's ancient tales
Steeped in the history of London
Green and Grey washes 
In a wispy white veil
Mist in the streets of Westminster
Wistful and weathered
The pride still prevails
Alive in the streets of the city 

Are they oblivious 
To this quality? 
A quality 
Of light unique to every city's streets 

Pavements may teem 
With intense energy 
But the city is calm 
In this violent sea

And I'm not prepared to fight

Or surrender to a reflex
I will trust my instincts
Or surrender to my fright

Sometimes we fight, against the darkness
Sometimes we fly, into the night

Wisdom of the priests""

Room that was hidden beneath the cave, 
I found it. I brushed away the dust of the years, 
And picked it up, holding it reverently in
My hands. I had no idea what it might be, but it was
Beautiful"" 

""I learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn
The keys to make them sound differently. As I struck the
Wires with my other hand, I produced my first harmonious
Sounds, and soon my own music.  How different it could
Be from the music of the Temples,  I can't wait to tell the
Priests about it""

What can this strange device be?
When I touch it, it gives forth a sound
It's got wires that vibrate and give music
What can this thing be that I found? 

See how it sings like a sad heart
And joyously screams out its pain
Sounds that build high like a mountain
Or notes that fall gently like rain

To a circle of grim, expressionless faces. Father Brown
Rose to his feet, and his somnolent voice echoed

Words of quiet rejection! Instead of praise, sullen
Dismissal. I watched in shock and horror as Father Brown
Ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath his
Feet""

Vivid to me. Clearly yet I see the beckoning hand of the
Oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase""

""I see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities
And the pure spirit of man revealed in the lives and works
Of this world. I was overwhelmed by both wonder and
Understanding as I saw a completely different way to life,
A way that had been crushed by the federation long ago. I
Saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss
Of all these things""

I wandered home though the silent streets
And fell into a fitful sleep
Escape to realms beyond the night
Dream can't you show me the light? 

I stand atop a spiral stair
An oracle confronts me there
He leads me on light years away
Through astral nights, galactic days 

I see the works of gifted hands
That grace this strange and wondrous land
I see the hand of man arise
With hungry mind and open eyes 

They left the planet long ago
The elder race still learn and grow
Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the home where they belong
Home, to tear the temples down, home, to change

""I have not left this cave for days now, it has become
My last refuge in my total despair. I have only the music of
The waterfall to comfort me now. I can no longer live
Under the control of the federation, but there is no other
Place to go. My last hope is that with my death I may pass
Into the world of my dream, and know peace at last""

The sleep is still in my eyes
The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
And lie a while in bed
I wish that it might come to pass
Not fade like all my dreams 

Just think of what my life might be
In a world like I have seen
I don't think I can carry on
Carry on this cold and empty life
Oh no, my spirits are low in the depths of despair
My lifeblood spills over

Attention all planets of the solar federation

The flooding through her memory

And streaked with tears of rage

With passion and precision
But now his mind is dark and dulled
By sickness and indecision

An' a green-eyed girl an' I used to go to see her.
I'd pull up the drive an' she'd jump in,
An' we'd head off down around the bend to the river.
Find a perfect spot an' throw a blanket on the ground:

Sit there talkin', till the sun went down, about nothin'.
Then one hot day in June,
The clouds rolled in right out of the blue.
As we ran for cover, I could smell her perfume, 

In that sweet, (I still remember,)
Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.)
Oh, that sweet, (I still remember,)
Sweet summer rain. (Sweet rain fallin' down on us.) 

We were jumpin' an' a-runnin' an' a-laughin' out loud.
The sky opened up like the bottom fell out of Heaven, yeah.
We dove in the car, turned the radio on,
Sat there soakin', singing along with Elton, Bennie And The Jets.

She turned an' looked my way,
Those raindrops slowly runnin' down on her face.
I reached out an' kissed her,

Rushlow Harris,"Stumbled across an old green box in my granddaddy's house
Inside was a cross, some old dog tags, and a picture of when he was shipping out
So I showed it to him, said, ""tell me about those days.""
When he looked inside, he closed his eyes all he could say was

""I hear bagpipes cryin' Amazing Grace, Omaha Beach and her crashing waves
Old Glory draped like Heaven's mercy over the fallen sons
I see all the heroes who were willing to fight in the name of freedom, layin' down their lives
And prayin' God's grace would keep us safe from harm, until they brought us boys back home.""

Those were words to a boy that became a man, now I'm ankle deep in this Persian sand
And every day I'm giving all I can because I'm damn proud to be American
Yeah, I made some friends, and I've lost some too
When I think about what they gave for me and you

I hear bagpipes cryin' Amazing Grace, tears rolling down a mother's face

Russ,"Yeah, yeah
Oh, mmm
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

I been climbin', the view's spectacular
Even if I crash, I'd rather drive than be the passenger
Slightly philosophical, I wanna die young as old as possible
As of late, I been feelin' responsible
For my family's livelihood, I think tonight we should
Celebrate the fact that I'm a star and that the likelihood
Of me blowin', in the next couple of months is definite
Anticipate me comin' like the porn stars in my messages
Speakin' of porn stars, all my exes all Latinas
Hits them like Tequila when they see me in arenas, and yeah
It hasn't happened yet but trust me, y'all gon' pay for it
Beatin' devils in disguise is everything I prayed for
I learned a lot though from all the above
I guess God got a job at the comedy club
But fuck that, I'm buzzin' now, whole industry flockin'
'Cause I'm the people's champ and you just industry poppin', c'mon

I been travelin' a lot now
Got to find the time to
Take it in and take a step back
Kick it with the family
I cannot help it that I'm focused on my vision
All the time, it just feels like it's an emergency
I tell my mama, don't you cry, I'll be back soon though
I'm always moving with a sense of urgency

Yeah, yeah, I swear I had a year that you can't ignore
I swear that no one's ever won, how I'm winnin' before
Pretty women like Julia Roberts come to the concerts
And scream daddy but I ain't about to adopt her
I gotta conquer and collect
Every motherfuckin' check, tryna pay a couple tuitions
Write 'em off as an expense
Let the takeover commence
If I say it, I believe it, you just dream of success
I stay awake to achieve it, it's crazy seeing
Girls I used to crush on, fuckin' to my love songs
Yeah, I'm gettin' commas but I'm 'bout to get my run on
Flights bi-coastal, everythin' paid for
That's just how it goes when you take what they wait for
Things are pickin' up, I'm just tryna find the peace
Some people shine and give it back but my shine is not a lease
This is permanently owned, if I lose it, it's on my terms
I don't wish for shit, I desired and acquire

I been travelin' a lot now
Got to find the time to
Take it in and take a step back
Kick it with the family
I cannot help it that I'm focused on my vision
All the time, it just feels like it's an emergency
I tell my mama, don't you cry, I'll be back soon though
I'm always moving with a sense of urgency

No failure is final, no success is permanent
It's madness, mom really 'bout to march like the tournament
Certain shits been fuckin' up my days and nights
Like yeah, my parents got no money so I guess I gotta pay the price
At least I have it, let me get my blessings straight
If this was last year, we'd be food stamps and Section 8
Awkward conversations with my dad he's feelin' cursed
He's askin' me for gas it's like the roles are reversed
Monitor what Russ is makin', feelin' like I'm suffocatin'
Feelin' like I need 10 shots and 2 blunts to chase it
Acceptin' what is and lettin' go of what was
Havin' faith in what could be if I just one up
Myself every time I let the chips fall, where they may
I got pit stops in LA, makin' shit pop every day, yeah
People stumble on stones that I used to step on
The chips I mentioned earlier, I pick 'em up and bet on myself

Got to find the time to

You were cheating every chance you got while I was faithful
Then you went with who you, told me not to worry 'bout
Now you got a baby with him, damn, that could've been me
Can't say that I hate you, if I had the money

I can tell you wanna do it but you don't know how to do it
'Cause you're scared to death
You can tell I wanna do it but I don't know how to do it

Russ Ballard,"I get the same old dream, same time every night
Fall to the ground and I wake up
So I get out of bed, put on my shoes, and in my head
Thoughts fly back to the break-up

These four walls are closing in
Look at the fix you've put me in!!

CHORUS:

Since you've been gone, since you've been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you've been gone
You cast the spell, so break it
Oooohhh - Whhooooaaa - Ooooohhh
Since you've been gone

So in the night I stand beneath the backstreet light
I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon, the night-time comes around too soon
You can't know what you mean to me

Your poison letter, your telegram
Just goes to show you don't give a damn

Russ Ballard,"Katie was a kid, 
I guess she hid her thoughts from everyone
Went to school at eight, she was never late
That girl didn't know the meaning of fun

Every night Katie prayed to God above
Daddy gave her everything but love
She woke up one day, said, I'm on my way
Her mummy read the letter, and it did say
I'm on my way, I'm on my way

Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels
She's having fun, fun, fun
She's having fun, fun, fun

They rode around 
And every boy in town tried to win her back
But it was no go,
'Cause she rode with Joe, he was the leader of the pack

People ran for cover when they rolled to town
Stand in the way, and baby, you were run down
Every night after light
You could always bet they'd be in a fight
There's gonna be a fight

Riding with the angels

Riding with the angels

She's having fun, fun, fun
She's having fun, fun, fun

The night was black, rain on the ground
People on the street, they could hear the sound
Out on the road, engines so loud
There must have been a hundred in the crowd

Katie and Joe, they were riding too fast
She knew that ride would be her last
Engine screamed, you could hear her shout
Look out, look out, look out

You could stand up and just walk away
By the time you stepped out the door
Bet you forget what we came here for

You see, what I mean to say, is
We can't lead our lives this way
We could forget at least we could try
To start again or say good bye

Baby, where do we go from here?
Baby, where do we go from here?
Baby, are you for one more try?
Darling, or do we say goodbye?

You're more like a stranger every day
I'm like a kid, who has lost his way
When we're together, we ain't the same
Guess in a way that we're both to blame

Oh, yeah, we both have our funny ways
When we've made it rain on no sunny days
We could pretend, what could we do
Girl I'm still a fool for you

Baby, where do we go from here?

 In the night 
 And then until the daybreak, they're gonna love or then before light

 There in the rain they bide their time, hustling what they can 
 They bet just to get that bottle in their hand

 And on a street in the heart of town, the lady in black she turns around

 She stares at the man in the Cadillac, he drives by but he'll be back, yeah 
 Before the light, there in the night 
 See the guy along the road, who can he be 
 Wait awhile he'll turn around, see the man is me 
 'Cause when I sleep I dream, dreams won't set me free

Russ Columbo,"I can't forget the night I met you,
That's all I'm thinking of;
And now you call it madness,
But I call it love.

You made a promise to be faithful
By all the stars above;
And now you call it madness,
I still call it love.

My heart is beating,It keeps on repeating,
For you constantly.
You're all I'm needing, And so I'm pleading,
""Please come back to me!""

You made a plaything out of romance!
What do you know of love?
That's why you call it madness,
But I call it love.",You Call It Madness (But I Call It Love)
Russ Columbo,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind

To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'll catch a fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon

And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Across my dreams with nets of wonder

Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name

This is where our story ends,
Never lovers, ever friends.

Goodbye, Let our hearts call it a day,
But before you walk away,
I sincerely want to say:

I wish you bluebirds in the Spring,
To give your heart a song to sing;
And then a kiss, but more than this I wish you love.

And in July, a lemonade,
To cool you in some leafy glade;
I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be,
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.

I wish you shelter from the storm,
A cozy fire to keep you warm;

I wish you love.

Seeing you in summer I never would go.
Your hair streaked with sun-light, your lips red as flame, your face with a luster.
That puts gold to shame.

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time

Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone

Russ Peterson,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Away from the lights of the city
Where an old time preacher pitched a ragged old tent
Looked like it was a hundred years old

He started out preaching to no one
But pretty soon a crowd started gathering
And he preached the gospel
At the corner of Heartbreak Ridge and New Hope Road

I turned into a wild man
Some people said I'd gone crazy
But all too soon came the harvest
Of the wild seeds that I had sown

Well, I stumbled into that meeting
I was looking like death warmed over
But then I heard the gospel
At the corner of Heartbreak Ridge and New Hope road

When they sing come ye sinners, lost and hopeless
Lord I was hopeless heaven knows
Something got a hold of me, something got a hold hallelujah
When I heard the gospel
At the corner of Heartbreak Ridge and New Hope Road

It's still a wide spot out in the country
Away from the lights of the city
I pitched that old tent he gave me
The day that he died and went home

Some times I start preaching to no one
But pretty soon a crowd starts gathering
And I now preach the gospel
At the corner of Heartbreak Ridge and New Hope Road

And we sing come ye sinners, lost and hopeless
Lord I was hopeless heaven knows
Something got a hold of me, something got a hold hallelujah

At the corner of Heartbreak Ridge and New Hope Road

	about his hopes and ambitions wasted through the years

and i fared little better when i tried settlin' down
maybe some magic moment - i've never known one, not for long
for all too soon the magic is in a moment gone

	it'll be a heartbreaking story about love and luck
	when i get down on the pages all i felt
	it will make the hardest-hearted of critics' hearts melt

when i was young love was fun and i was so happy - i looked so good and i dressed so snappy
two-tone shoes on my feet big old smile on my face - as i moved and grooved all over the place
now i'm down in the heels my complexion is bad

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Lose their taste for kissing?

I have visions of many things
Love's happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion
What becomes of the brokenhearted?
Who's had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some peace of mind
Maybe the fruits of love grow all around
But for me, they come a tumblin' down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't find my way much longer
Help me; I'm searching though I don't succeed
To satisfy this growing need
If there's no way
No chance for a beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending
I walk in shadows, searching for light
Cold and lone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and prayin' for someone to care
Always movin' and goin' nowhere
Now what's become of the brokenhearted?
Who's had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care
I'll be looking everyday

When I'm three states away and bleary-eyed
It's dream that I might breed you air again
And that this road will end at your bedside

Oh one more song for the freeway home

And then this dream you're with me everywhere
It's only 'cause you're there I'm near my wing
And these cords keep ringing through my mind
When I'm supposed to be on a side don't mean a thing
My eyes are happy just to watch you glow

Oh one more song for the freeway home

So if this song should make it to your ears
Let it be a souvenir you can call your own

A voice of just one man out of state alone

That's what I'd like to do; see the heather but with you.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder,there's lazy music in the rill,
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.
There may be other days as rich and rare,
There may be other springs as full and fare,
But the won't be the same, they'll come and go
For this I know;
That when the mist is in gloamin'
And all the clouds are holdin' still,
If you're not there I won't go roamin' through the heather on the hill, 
The heather on the hill.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still

Russell Watson,"Qui dove il mare luccica
E tira forte il vento
Su una vecchia terrazza
Davanti al golfo di Surriento

Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza
Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce
E ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
E una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Penso alle notti la in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
E la bianca scia d'un elica

Senti il dolore nella musica
E si alzo dal pianoforte ma quando
Vide la luna uscire da una nuvola
Gli sembro piu dolce anche la morte

Guardo negli occhi la ragazza
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso usci una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assai ecc

Poi penso alla lirica, e al grande palco
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro ma due occhi
Che ti guardano, cosi vicini e veri

Ti fan scordare le parole
O in fondo I tuoi pensieri
Cosi diventa tutto piccolo
Anche le notti la in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita

Come la scia d'un elica
Ma si, e la vita che finisce
Ma lui non ci pensava tanto
Anzi, si sentiva gia felice
E ricomincio il suo canto

Te voglio bene assai, ecc

Miserere, miserere,
Miserere, misero me,
Pero brindo alla vita!

Ma che mistero, e la mia vita,
Che mistero!
Sono un peccatore dell'anno ottantamila,
Un menzognero!
Ma dove sono e cosa faccio,
Come vivo?
Vivo nell'anima del mondo
Perso nel vivere profondo!

Io sono il santo che ti ha tradito
Quando eri solo
E vivo altrove e osservo il mondo
Dal cielo,
E vedo il mare e le foreste,
Vedo me che...
Vido nell'anima del mondo
Perso nel vivere profondo!

Se see'e una notte buia abbastanza
Da nascondermi, nascondermi,
Se see'e una luce, una speranza,
Sole maginifico che splendi dentro me
Dammi la gioia di vivere
Che anchora non see'e!

Miserere, miserere,
Quella gioia di vivere
Che forse ancora non see'e.

Who's always there to catch the tears
When they fall
Who do you run to
Who do you always call
Who's there with the shoulder when you're feeling sad
When will you see me as more than that
Who's always there to catch the tears
To me You're everything
You're all I need
To me
That's who I see
Someone I love to run to
To hold in my arms and I like to come to
Someone to share my life
Your heart's with someone else
But who's standing by

Who's standing by to catch the tears
When they fall
Who do you run to
Who do you always call
Who's there with the shoulder when you're feeling sad
When will you see me as more than that
Was always there to catch the tears
Oh I wish you would see me as more than just a friend
You come to
When somebody breaks your heart to talk to
Someone who always care
Your heart's with someone else
But who's always there

Who's always there to catch the tears
When they fall
Who do you run to
Who do you always call
Who's there with the shoulder when you're feeling sad
When will you see me as more than that
Who's always there to catch the tears

Getting from there to here
It's been a long time
But my time is finally near
And I can feel the change in the wind right now
Nothing's in my way
And they're not gonna hold me down no more
No, they're not gonna hold me down

'Cause I've got faith of the heart
I'm going where my heart will take me
I've got faith to believe
I can do anything
I've got strength of the soul
And no one's gonna bend or break me
I can reach any star

I can do anything
I've got strength of the soul
And no one's gonna bend or break me
I can reach any star

I've known the wind so cold, I've seen the darkest days
But now the winds I feel, are only winds of change
I've been through the fire and I've been through the rain

Granada, tierra sonada por mi,
Mi cantar se vuelve gitano
Cuando es para ti.
Mi cantar, hecho de fantasia;
Mi cantar, flor de melancolia,
Que yo te vengo a dar.
Granada, tierra ensangretada
En tardes de toros,
Mujer que conserva el embrujo
De los ojos moros.
De sueno, rebelde, gitana
Cubierta de flores,
Why beso tu boca de grana,
Jugosa manzana
Que me habla de amores.
Granada, manola, cantada
En coplas preciosas,
No tengo otra cosa que darte
Que un ramo de roas,
De rosas de suave fragrancia
Que le dieran marco a la Virgen morena.
Granada, tu tierra esta llena
De lindas mujere, de sangre why de sol.

Translation:
Granada, land of my dreams,
Mine becomes a gypsy song
When I sing to you.
My song, born of fancy;
My song, melancholy flower,
That I've come to offer you.
Granada, land covered in blood
From the bullfighting afternoons,
Woman who retains the spell
Of Moorish eyes.
A dream-land, a rebel, a gypsy,
Covered with flowers,
And I kiss your scarlet mouth,
Juicy apple
That tells me about love affairs.
Granada, my beautiful, sung
In precious coplas,
I have nothing else to give you
But a bouquet of roses
Worthy of adorning the brown-skinned Virgin.
Granada, your soil is full
Of beautiful woman, blood and sunshine.

How did I wake up each day,
Before that moment I saw your face
Where was I before your touch
Nowhere is where I was without you.
Without you in, my life was just a lie,
Before you I don't know how I got by.

Before I met you, before I held you in the night,
I don't know how I survived.
Before I found you, before you made everything right,
I was hurt for life.
Wasn't really living 'til you came into my life
I got through it baby,
But I don't know how I got by.

How did I get through those nights
Before that moment I held you tight.
Where was I before your kiss
How did I exist without you.
Life had no meaning, no reason and no rhyme,
Before you I don't know how I got by.

Before I met you, before I held you in the night
I don't know how I survived.
Before I found you, before you made everything right.
Wasn't really living 'til you came into my life,
I got through it baby,
But I don't know how I got by.

I thank God when I wake up,
I'm waking next to you.
I don't know what I was living for, before you,
Before you whoooah!!!

Before I met you, before I held you in the night
I don't know how I survived.
Before I found you, before you made everything right,
I was hurt for life.
Wasn't really living 'til you came into my life
I got through it baby,
But I don't know how I got by.





",I Just Don't Know How I Got By
Russell Watson,"Every generation blames the one before
And all of their frustrations come beating on your door
I know that I'm a prisoner to all my father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage to all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could've told him in the living years

Oh, crumpled bits of paper filled with imperfect thoughts
Stilted conversations I'm afraid that's all we've got
You say you just don't see it he says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement in this present tense
We all talk a different language, talking in defense

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

So we open up a quarrel between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future it's the bitterness that lasts
So don't yield to the fortunes you sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective on a different day
And if you don't give up and don't give in, you may just be okay

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

I wasn't there that morning when my father passed away
I didn't get to tell him all the things I had to say
I think I caught his spirit later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo in my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear

You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up?.To more than I can be.

Can't control this
can't let go this

is something I can't seem to do
If I could turn this dust to gold
you'd see it clearly

I wear them just like hand-me-downs

sarà come una musica

e suonerà per noi.

Magia sarà



Io che spiegare non so

il mistero che a volte è la vita

non mi dimenticherò

la dolcezza e la gioia infinita

nella poesia dell'amor

che vive nel fondo del cuore

in noi, per noi



Sarà come un angelo

e volerà

fra le nuvole del tramonto

si addormenterà

con un canto nell'anima

Magia l'amore sarà

e volerà







English Translation:

It Will Be Magic

(lyrics & music by Matteo Saggese/Mino Vergnaghi)



Though I can't really speak

about the things that life teaches

I won't forget

the caresses of fragile fingers

And the poetry of love

that lives in the depths of the heart

Within us, for us



It will be like an angel

And it will fly

Over seas and blossoming hills

In the immensity

It will be like music

And it will play for us

It will be magic



Though I can't explain

the mystery that sometimes is life

I won't forget

The sweetness and the infinite joy

Inside the poetry of love

that lives in the depths of the heart

Within us, for us



It will be like an angel

And it will fly

Among the clouds of the sunset

It will fall asleep

With a chant in the soul

Love will be magic

And it will fly

Over villages and cities

It will spread

Among the people of the world

And the dream will carry on

Now and forever

It will be magic",Magia Sarà
Russell Watson,"As the sun goes down on another day
I know you'll still be there for me

I know how hard you try, I know
Your day is long, I can see it your eyes
Sometimes you can't go on
And yet still you're here for me

Places we have been
Sunsets we will see
Over seas and across the lands
I know that you'll be there for me

As the sun goes down and the times roll on
I know you'll still be there for me

Though there are nights so cold
I know your love, it grows and our hearts
Will never die, two souls entwined as one
Like an endless galaxy

Like the stars that shine
In a moonlit sky
That reminds me of your eyes
As I gaze at thee

I know you'll still be there for me

",You'll Still Be There for Me (Based on the Theme from the Motion ...)
Russell Watson,"I have often walked
Down the street before,
But the pavement always
Stayed beneath my feet before.
All at once am i
Several stories high,
Knowing I?m on the street where you live.

Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live.

Russell Watson,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak 
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are songs to be sung Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today

Russell Watson,"The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on

And guess who sighs a lullaby
To nights that never end?
My fickle friend,
The summer wind
Mmm the summer wind
The summer wind
The summer wind",The Summer Wind

Rusted Root,"Shades of gray coldness from inside
Snowed in without a shovel or plow
Rhetoric on the radio, don't you go outside

I shiver in the dark coldness all around
Hide behind my jacket, listen to the cold facts of lies
Because we will we will burn
We will, we will burn for the winter

A man pulls off his glove
To take a look at the time
From beneath the watch
Sweat starts to flow

A father cries out into the night as his child slips away
A door shuts as the boy reaches that forbidden room
And the shades of gray, getting lighter and lighter
And the shades of gray getting lighter and lighter

I've learned to change my name, into this open flame 

Cause there's bullets in the fire,
I believe I lost my head
Will you ever know what was sent down before those things went crazy,
Is everything I ever thought it would be,
As the puppets in my head have turned into hoods,
Well please bring the rain, bring the rain, rain

Hold me touch me baby as I thank you, you

Cause now those days are gone,
Lights have passed me by.
My days were long taking shelter from the sky,
& there's a pulpit in my head that's turned
Into a garden waiting for her lonely cry, cry

Cause there's bullets in the fire,
I believe I lost my head
Will you ever know what was sent down before those things went

And here's my gods,
Long before my head had turned to the blue sky speaking words 

Reasons why,
All my time was spent making wine to bait the drunk
I'd have to find now, now, now

With Mr. Jimmy

That we would have a soda
My favorite flavor vanilla cream

It?s older than anger, it?s infant and primal

You're the one, the one
I always wanted to be now

you've been next to me

There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Nowhere to go and no place to call home

And even sometimes he would go away, too

I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile
He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely,"" and ever since that day

And when we're bored we play in the woods

Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green

Soon enough we reached Neverland

Where the drinks are hotter than the chili sauce

He wears a red bandana, plays a blues pianna
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash and a black moustache
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico

Well, the first time that I saw him
He was sittin' on a piano stool
I said ""Tell me dad, when does the fun begin?""
He just winked his eye and said ""Man, be cool""

He wears a red bandana, plays a blues pianna
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash and a black moustache

All of a sudden in walks this chick
Joe starts playing on a Latin kick
Around her waist she wore three fishnets
She started dancin' with the castanets

I didn't know just what to expect
She threw her arms around my neck
We started dancin' all around the floor
And then she did a dance I never saw before

So if you're south of the border
I mean down in Mexico
And you wanna get straight

A fellow in my arms.

I never get heartbroken, no, I'll never get the blues
And if I play that game of love I know I just can't lose.
When they spin that wheel of fortune all I do is kiss my chips
And I know I picked a winner 'cause I've got lucky lips.

Lucky lips are always kissing,
Lucky lips are never blue.
Lucky lips will always find
A pair of lips that will be true.
I don't need a four-leaf clover,
Rabbit's foot or good luck charm.
With lucky lips I'll always have
A fellow in my arms.",Lucky Lips

Morning, noon and night time too

He’s neglecting our romance

Ruth Etting,"In my imagination, I'm finding consolation
Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

When you're gone, I wonder on,
To all the world I'm like a stranger,

Each night and day, the skies are grey,
The birds, the bees, the trees,
The summer breezes, fade away,
When you're with somebody else.

Its hard to care, and have to share,
The love that I've known,
Oh can't you see I want you all for my own?

I know that love's a game,
So who's to blame?

I hope, and pray, and keep on wondering

When you dance with me, I'm in heaven when the music begins
I can see the sun when it's raining, hiding every cloud from my view

Hiegh ho, who cares
Nobody writes his songs for me
No one belongs to me

That's the least of my cares
I may be sad at times
And disinclined to play
But it's not bad at times
To go your own sweet way

Nobody's arms belong to me
No arms feel strong to me
I admire the moon as a moon, just a moon
Nobody's heart belongs to me today

opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.

Set ablaze the billboards and their advertisements
Love with all your hearts and never forget
How good it feels to be alive
And strive for your desire
Just cause you can't see
Your cage doesn't mean that you are free
When there are laws against nature
But its okay for you to be
Addicted to over the counter prescriptions
And magazines dictate all our human relations

I'm not buying, no I'm not giving in
To a culture that objectifies all of our women
I'm not buying, no I'm not consuming
The apathetic dribble on the news media's chin

The lies that are sold through textbooks to children
I'm not buying, no I'm not consuming

Always overcome the negative right

I'll (D) sing the record of (G) deeds that he did
Way out in New Mexico a long time (D) ago
When a (G) man's only friend was his (D) own forty- (G) four

Now when Billy the Kid was a very young lad
In old Silver City he went to the bad
Way out west with a knife in his hand
At the age of twelve years he killed his first man

Fair Mexican maidens play guitars and sing
Songs about Billy their boy bandit king
Before this young manhood reached its sad end
He'd a notch on his pistol for twenty one men

It was on one black night that poor Billy died
He said to his friends, ""I'm not satisfied
There's twenty one men that I've put bullets through
And sheriff Pat Garrett's gonna make twenty-two""

Well, this is how Billy the Kid met his fate
A big moon was shining and the hour was late
Shot down by Pat Garrett, Silver City's best friend
The poor outlaw's life have reached its sad end

Would he shoot his brother and sister down ?

Late one Friday evening everybody was sad
We lost the best president we ever had
But he's gone home, gone back home
He's staying away too long

Rode from town to town holdin' up for our rights
Some low down rascal took the President's life
But he's gone home, gone back home
He's staying away too long

Mrs. Kennedy got a mansion on the Island, stayed 9 months, all she'd be
She have another mansion, soon as she reach Washington, D.C.
But he's gone home, gone back home
He's staying away too long

Everybody votes, they don't know what's goin' on
If Goldwater get it, we won't have no home
But he's gone home, gone back home

I think Mr. Kennedy have a right to this long white robe

Cross the Rio Grande and you will find
An old adobe house

Takes no time for you to get a Mexican divorce

I looked at all my windows but I couldn't find one light

And now, my love, I beg

Called up your number all night long
No consolations on the telephone
Ran out and caught that midnight flight
Thought a little loving would make everything all right

Ran it up to about fifty grand
Cashed it in and held it in my hand

",Better Things to Think About
Ry Cooder,"This here was our situation 
We was just young wild wood boys 
New as the birth of the nation 
The kind that the Army employs 
High riding Rebs from Missouri 
Fought for the gray and Quantril
Caught up by the battle and the fury 
Back when just living was hell 

After the battle was over 
And after the Union had won 
It was quitting that made us the loser 
So we kept doing just what we'd done 
Riding as comrades together 
We looted the trains and the banks 
Removing that carpetbag money 
And sticking it hard to the Yanks 

Death always follows behind you 
When you ride down that old outlaw trail 
Someday a bullet will find you 
Or you'll rot like a corpse in some jail 
Turning your back to the danger 
Is a wager no man can afford 
'Cause gold turns a friend to a stranger 
Like old Judas turned on our Lord 

Men are revered and remembered 
While they lay in that coffin and rot 
Some live in the legends of history 
Most are forever forgot 
The victory it goes to the strongest 
And only the strong will survive 
Survival is living the longest 
But nobody gets out alive 

The questions don't never get answered 
And the rights, they're remembered all wrong 
The facts, they can get plenty confusing 
So someday if you happen to be singing this song 
Remember it's just for the record 
You can't change the handwork of fate 
And tell 'em I lived for the moment 
And I died when I tried to go straight",Wildwood Boys

Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh honey stay off of my shoes
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes

You can burn my house, steal my car
And drink my liquor out of my fruit jar

Came a lovely woman in motion with hair as dark as night

She danced around and 'round to guitar melody
From the fire her face was all aglow
How she enchanted me
How I'd love to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

It's been raining in my mouth all day
Dripping down to my clothes
My patience it is wearing thin
Got a fire inside my nose
Searching for the truth the way God designed it
The truth is I might drown before I find it

Well, I need a woman
Yes, I do
Need a woman
Yes, I do
Someone who can see me as I am
Give the kind of love that don't have to be condemned

And I want you to be that woman
Every night
Be that woman
Treat me right

I've had my eyes on you, baby
For about five long years
You probably don't know me at all
But I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears
Now you don't frighten me
I ain't no defendant
And you look like it wouldn't hurt you none
To have a man of understanding

Well, I need a woman
Oh, don't I
Need a woman
Bring it home safe at last

I've seen you standing on the corner
Seen you sitting down in the park
Been watching you in the sunshine
Walking with you in the dark

And I want you to be that woman
Treat me right
Be that woman
Every night

Well, if you believe in something long enough
You just naturally come to think it's true
There ain't no wall you can't crossover
Ain't no fire you can't walk through
Well, believing is all right
Just don't let the wrong people know what it's all about
They might put the evil eye on you
Use their hidden powers to try to turn you out

Well, I need a woman
Just to be my queen
Need a woman
Black, white, yellow, brown, blue or green

Riding out with me at midnight
Like two Spanish desperadoes
Gazing down upon the futile world
In her Cadillac Eldorado
We will penetrate the storm
In search of truth that has not been tested
But she better bring along her checkbook
Just in case we get arrested

And I want you to be that woman

Another man held that fire 
Burned our house to the ground

Pretty flowers turn out in the spring
And the light turns out in the kitchen

All that low-down funky rhythm makes him jump and shout
Just got to find that ghetto planet that everyone's talkin' about

Tuning in the local scene on the radio
The D.J. on the radar screen is telling him where to go
The funky fever's getting louder, sounds just like a soul encounter
Cruisin' for some bar-be-que right up Central Avenue
And he's got a little dance he wants to do

He pulls up to a big night club in his UFO
Gets right in with all the folks out on the big dance floor
It really stops the action, everybody's mystified
To see that little step he's got as he goes glidin' by

Now, he ain't doin' the Gigolo 'cause he ain't got no hips
Looks like the Funky Chicken man, 'cept he ain't got no hips
Those shiny metal threads he's wearin' really got some class
I'd say he was doin' the Bomp, but I can't seem to find his ass

I got a short time living and a long greasy time to pay (play) dead
Ain't doing no favours, ain't asking for none
Honey, I got money, I can pay for my fun
That's the way I want it, that's the way it must be done

[Because]
I wanna ball like I never did ball before [Before, before, before]
I wanna ball like I never did ball before [Before, before, before]
I may never get a break like this in life no more

A certain little mama [You ???? for me]
Gonna jump and shout [Oh, yeah]
When the El Dorado rolls up [ Ah]
And I'll come walking out [???]
Gonna tell ya pretty baby [Say you like nothing]
You don't know what it's all about
(I've got) No special woman [No special woman]
Want no special friend [No special friend]
Want a good time today [Good time today]
Tomorrow may be down again [May be down again]
Don't dial my number [Oh, Lord]
I'll tell you when [I'll tell you when]

I wanna ball like I never did ball before [Before, before, before]
Really wanna...never did ball before [Before, before, before]
I may never get a break like this in life no more



",Let's Have a Ball
Ry Cooder,"(Raymond Quevedo)

How different the ladies of long ago to the modern women that we all know
If you observe you are bound to see that sex has changed entirely
A long ago their one ambition in life, was to be a mother and a wife
Now they go out imitating the males by smoking cigarettes and drinking cocktails

Girls used to like to be school teachers, gradually becoming stenographers
We next hear of them as lecturers, authors and engineers
There is no limit to their ambition, they've even gone in for aviation
And if you men don't assert control your women will rule the world

Play a bridge!

Now they say anything that your man can do, they also can achieve too
And they've openly boasted to do their part in the literature and art
We will next hear of them as candidates for the president of these United States
And if you men don't assert control your women will rule the world

Now you hear on the radio and TV of a great national calamity
Story of tragic proportion coming from the White House in Washington
The facts in the case are clearly stated the president is being cruely dominated
By a international conspiracy that threatens world peace and security



",Women Will Rule the World
Ry Cooder,"Que lejos estoy del suelo donde he nacido!
Inmensa nostalgia invade mi pensamiento;
Why al ver me tan solo why triste qual hoja al viento,
Quisiera llorar, quisiera morir de sentimiento.

Oh tierra del sol!, suspiro por verte
Ahora que lejos yo vivo sin luz, sin amor;
Why al verme tan solo why triste cual hoja al viento,
Quisiera llorar, quisiera morir de sentimiento.",A Canci贸n Mixteca
Ry Cooder,"There's a place where I've been told 
Every street is paved with gold 
And it's just across the borderline 
And when it's time to take your turn 
Here's a lesson that you must learn 
You could lose more than you'll ever hope to find 

When you reach the broken promised land 
And every dream slips through your hands 
Then you'll know that it's too late to change your mind 
'Cause you've paid the price to come so far 
Just to wind up where you are 
And you're still just across the borderline 

Up and down the Rio Grande 
A thousand footprints in the sand 
Reveal a secret no one can define 
The river flows on like a breath 
In between our life and death 
Tell me who's the next to cross the borderline 

En la triste oscuridad (In the sad darkness) 
Hoy tenemos que cruzar (today we have to cross) 
Este rÃ­o que nos llama mas alla (this river which calls us further away) 

But hope remains when pride is gone 
And it keeps you moving on 
Calling you across the borderline 

When you reach the broken promised land 
Every dream slips through your hands 
And you'll know it's too late to change your mind 
'Cause you pay the price to come so far 
Just to wind up where you are 
And you're still just across the borderline 
Now you're still just across the borderline 
And you're still just across the borderline",Across the Borderline
