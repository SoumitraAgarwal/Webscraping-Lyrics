Sarah Jaffe,"Fifty states
Fifty lines
Fifty crying all the time's
Fifty boys
Fifty lies
Fifty ""I'm gonna change my minds'""
I changed my mind
I changed my mind
Now I feel indifferent

We were young
We were young
We were young we didn't care
Is it gone
Is it gone
Is it floating in the air?
I changed my mind
I changed my mind
Now I feel indifferent

All that time, wasted
I wish I was a little more delicate
I wish my

I wish my name was Clementine

Sarah Jaffe,"Here's your chance
I give you what you want
I am a giver
Here's your chance
To tell me what you want
I'm a forgiver

When nobody's around
I try and I take care
I must deliver
When nobody is home
I will knock at the door
I'm a pretender

Sarah Jaffe,"Hello
How do you feel?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
Hi
I guess I feel high
Cold sweat
Dripping down
My body

Are you trying to tell me something with your eyes?
All I wanna do now is lay down and die
If you're gonna do it
You better do it right
But my heart won't stop swelling

Sarah James,"Like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.
Like a worm on a hook,
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
If I, if I have been unkind,
I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you.

Like a baby, stillborn,
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,
She cried to me, ""Hey, why not ask for more?""

Oh like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.",Bird on a Wire
Sarah James,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Sarah James,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Sarah James,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss
Sarah Jane Cion,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul
Sarah Jane Cion,"I often wonder why he came to me
Brought such a flame to me

And let it die
And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye

With every new love you
Will come back to me
In others eyes, its you I see
If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

If I love again
I'll find other charms
But I'll make believe, you are in my arms
And though my lips whisper

""I love you""
My heart will not be true
I'll be loving
Every time I love again",If I Love Again
Sarah Jane Cion,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?",How Long Has This Been Going On?
Sarah Jane Morris,"If blood will flow when flesh and steel are one
Drying in the color of the evening sun
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
But something in our minds will always stay

Perhaps this final act was meant
To clinch a lifetime's argument
That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could

For all those born beneath an angry star
Lest we forget how fragile we are

On and on the rain will fall
Like tears from a star
Like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say
How fragile we are
How fragile we are

On and on the rain will fall
Like tears from a star
Like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say
How fragile we are
How fragile we are
How fragile we are
How fragile we are",Fragile
Sarah Jane Morris,"Don't leave me this way
I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without your love, oh baby
Don't live me this way

I can't exist, I will surely miss
Your tender kiss
So don't leave me this way

Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
Your started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning, out of control
So come on down and satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good loving can set me free

Don't leave me this way
I don't understand how I'm at your command
So baby please don't leave me this way.

Don't leave me this way
'Cause I can't exist
I will surely miss
Your tender kiss
So don't leave me this way

Oh baby, my heart is full of love and
desire for you...

So don't leave me this way

Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you...

Sarah Jarosz,"I spin around in your love
In a place of wonder
I want to wander
With you, my muse

In a dream of carousels
On waves in caravels
Collecting seashells
For you, my muse

I peruse and conjure
Sit and ponder
Then go under
The blanket of your words
The way I feel
The things I sing
The songs I write
The joy you bring
To me my muse

Stillness surrounds me
But you have found me
And I have found you
My muse

In a night of silence
I'm settled by your sounds
In a dream of quiet
Contentedness surrounds

I peruse and conjure
Sit and ponder
Then go under
The blanket of your words
The way I feel
The things I sing
The songs I write
The joy you bring
To me my muse

Delightfully exhausted
Willingly this way
Always yours, always yours I'll stay
With you, my muse",My Muse
Sarah Jarosz,"Many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea
There lived a maiden you may know
By the name of Annabelle Lee
No other thought did trouble her mind
But to love and be loved by me

We were children both
In this kingdom by the sea
But we loved with a love that was more than love
I and my Annabelle Lee
With a love that the winged angels high
Coveted her and me

This was the reason long ago
In this kingdom by the sea
A wind blew from a stormy cloud
That took my Annabelle Lee
Then her wicked brothers came
To steal her away from me

They shut her up in a tomb below
This kingdom by the sea
But no maiden's grave could sever my soul
From the love she bore for me
For the moon don't beam without a dream
Of my darling Annabelle Lee

For many years I've wandered
Through this kingdom by the sea
I've laid myself beside the bones
Of my beautiful Annabelle Lee
I'll make my bed near the rising tide
In her tomb by the sounding sea",Annabelle Lee
Sarah Jarosz,"Just when you start to look away
And I don't know what I should say
I can't distinguish night from day
Then you come around

Just when things are lookin' down
And everybody's wearing frowns
The king went and misplaced his crown
But it'll come around

And I don't want to lose my faith in you
'Cause sometimes I don't have a clue
Of what I've done and what I should do
But I'll come around

These summer nights are hot and still
The days are long but time instills
A sense of hope, a coming thrill
And I know it will

Just when life seems like a lost cause
People spinning words into angry flaws
And I don't know who I am or who I was
Life comes around

And I don't want to lose my faith in you
Cause sometimes I don't have a clue
Of what I've done and what I should do
But I'll come around

Just when the whirlwind begins
Things twirling out of control, lost in the spin
You gotta take a step back, start over again
Find a way to win

I may be young, I may be old
I may be telling, I may be told
I may be wise, I may be bold
But I'll come around

And I don't want to lose my faith in you
Cause sometimes I don't have a clue
Of what I've done and what I should do
But I'll come around

You'll come around
Come around",Come Around
Sarah Jarosz,"Sonic satisfaction
Holds my ears in sweet embrace
The endless chain reaction
Of what we give and what we take

Going through the motions
And acting out this part
Sifting through the pages
Of the life that I can start

Calloused fingers fumble
On the boardwalk of my muse
Feeling fit to crumble
Some days I wake up with the blues

Holding onto my time
Or at least what I've got left
I'll work with what I'm given
And I'll dream up all the rest

Throw away the watches
Call off every bet
The time ain't mine for saving
But I'll take what I can get

Holding onto wisdom
Of the ones who came before
Floating in the balance
Of the calm before the storm",Floating in the Balance
Sarah Jarosz,"I saw a gypsy today
She was beautiful
I couldn't look away
She was yellow and gray
The colors of the day
A bit too gorgeous
And not much to say

Stars on her little white wrists
Silken ribbons
Flowing from her hips
A smile that stopped time
Bittersweet as wine
She's lost and she's fine
Taking her time
I saw a gypsy today

Across the way
I heard someone say
Pick up a penny
Have luck for a day
But I picked that coin up
And I ain't found no luck
Just wanderin' and stuck
In the mud and the muck
But I saw a gypsy today",Gypsy
Sarah Jarosz,"When I ventured here
Truth was far not near
So I traveled on
Truth revealed in song

I was here nor there
Always asking where
So I took my time
My heart for me to find

As I made my way
Through long and winding days
I came upon your heart beating rhythms 
That challenged the deepest sea's waves
I could not look away

You were here nor there
Always asking where
So you took your time
You're hard for me to find

When I ventured here
Truth was far not near
So I traveled on
Truth revealed in song",Here Nor There
Sarah Jarosz,"Ring them bells ye heathen from the city that dreams
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
For they're deep and they're wide
And the world on its side
And time is running backwards
And so is the bride

Ring them bells Saint Peter 
where the four winds blow
Ring them bells with an iron hand
So the people will know
For it's rush hour now
On the wheel and the plow
And the sun is going down upon the sacred cow.

Ring them bells Sweet Martha for the poor man's son
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one
For the shepherd is asleep
Where the willows weep
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep

Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
Ring them bells for all of us who are left
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the game is through
Ring them bells for the time that flies
For the child that cries
When the innocence dies

Ring them bells Saint Catherine from the top of the room
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom
For the lines are long and the fighting is strong
And they're breaking down the distance between right and wrong",Ring Them Bells
Sarah Jarosz,"Follow me down through the cotton fields
Moon shadow shine bright the way you will
Lead us down a road where no one goes
We can run away

Come take my hand while I'm waiting here
Get away from it all and find what's real
If we don't get out now the chance won't reappear
We can run away

Hold me tight and don't let go
Sweet and soft no one will know
We can run away

I buried my heart in a willow tree
You came along, gave it back to me
Now we're creatures of the night, 
We set each other free
Run away with me

Hold me tight and don't let go
Sweet and soft no one will know
We can run away

Lay with me down by the riverside
Stars in the sky shining in your eyes
We won't make a sound no one will be around

We can run away",Run Away
Sarah Jarosz,"It barks at no one else but me
Like it's seen a ghost
I guess it's seen the sparks a-flowing
No one else would know

Hey man slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down

Sometimes I get overcharged
That's when you see sparks
You ask me where the hell I'm going
At a thousand feet per second

Idiot slow down, slow down

Hey man slow down, slow down

Sarah Jarosz,"Build me up from bones
Wrap me up in skin
Hold me close enough to breathe me in

The moon's a fingernail
Scratching on the back
Of the night in which we lay beside

I held every inch of you
I wrote every line for you
I made time when time was all but gone
You're the love I've always known

The night's so dark and grey
But you've helped me find my way
Through the wild and wonders of this world

So take me with you now
I need to show you how
I can love you better than before

Sarah Johns,"My roots run deep down a dirt road
Rough and tumbles in my blood
I was raised to make my own way, the hard way
Life knocks me down, I get back up

But don't be fooled by my independence
I'm not so tough in love

So, baby, baby my heart
Just a little
Treat it like it's gonna break
If you let it go

And baby, be soft with me
Tell me you love me, you'll take good care of me
I wanna feel safe in your arms
So, baby, baby my heart

So, don't worry about the world in my face
The bad days, I know how to laugh and deal with that
Yeah, I'm a big girl but I had my moments when
I feel fragile, I need you to hold me

And, baby my heart
Just a little
Treat it like it's gonna break

Sarah Johns,"Never moved to the big ol city

If you'd a been there I swear you would've felt it to
But I spilled red wine on his red shirt
I stuttered and stumbled over all my words

Cause he's got these brown eyes that drive me crazy
And oh my god that smile of his just slays me
Yeah I love him, wanna have his babies
The only problem is he hates me

I thought I'd make things better so I asked if he'd like to dance
If we could get a little closer I thought might have a chance
Then my ex walked in and a fight broke out
So much for a kiss with his busted up mouth

But he's got these brown eyes that drive me crazy
And oh my god that smile of his just slays me
Yeah I love him, wanna have his babies
The only problem is he hates me

We could be honeymooning' south of the border
If he'd just drop that restraining order

And you still have soul

And even heroes have to fall
And every diamond has its flaw

And show me that you care

Whether you are false or true

Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong

You need me so

Sarah McLachlan,"Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night

He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing stretching every nerve
Had to listen had no choice

I did not believe the information
I just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom boom boom
""Son,"" he said, ""Grab your things, I've come to take you home.""

To keepin' silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut

So I went from day to day
Tho' my life was in a rut
'Till I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut

I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom boom boom
""Hey,"" he said, ""grab your things, I've come to take you home.""

When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free

Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes,but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me

Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom boom boom
""Hey,"" I said, ""You can keep my things, they've come to take me home.""",Solsbury Hill [Live] [Live]

It's a very strange world that leaves me
Holding on to nothing when there's nothing left to lose

Sometime soon for all to see
The walls are slowly breaking down
In my mind I've seen it all
And someday we'll be free

We're searching for a message
Or so I thought but so it seems
The ignorance in the myths of others
Is easier to redeem
I've never questioned the answers given
To find the faith that's been lost within
'cause where I lay my trust in others
Where it lies the ground is thin

'cause I don't know the way

I can show you places where our time has had no ware""

Sarah McLachlan,"When we wore a heart of stone we wandered to the sea
Hoping to find some comfort there yearning to feel free
And we were mesmerized by the lull of the night and the smells that filled the air
And we laid us down on sandy ground it was cold but we didn't care

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn to the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea

We fell asleep and began to dream when something broke the night
Memories stirred inside of us, the struggle and the fight
And we could feel the heat of a thousand voices telling us which way to go
And we cried out is there no escape from the words that plague me so

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn to the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea

In the still and the silent dawn another day is born
Washed up by the tireless waves the body bent and torn
When you wake in the face of the blinding sun, and you search only to find
That heaven is a stranger place than what you've left behind

Still life a dying swansong forever

Loose I'm all alone I'm all alone

While the helpless line up on the doorsteps

As Eden's sixth day now all you've been allowed 
Is taken away they will not let you be so proud 
And you have felt the fear growing inside 
Protest follows far and wide they'll see how long 
It will take 'till you fall from so much denied

That they will never guess so unfair they 
They can make you feel so small

What is there to give or to believe

They told me plenty
I already knew
You never felt a thing
So soon forgotten all that you do
In more than words I
Tried to tell you
The more I tried I failed
I would not let myself believe
That you might stray
And I would stand by you
No matter what they'd say
I would have thought I'd be with you
Until my dying day
Until my dying day
I used to think my life
Was often empty
A lonely space to fill
You hurt me more than
I ever would have imagined
You made my world stand still
And in that stillness
There was a freedom
I never felt before
I would not let myself believe
That you might stray
And I would stand by you

To have and to hold that precious little thing 
Like every generation yields 
The new born hope unjaded by their years 
Pressed up against the glass 
I found myself wanting sympathy 
But to be consumed again 
Oh I know would be the death of me 
And there is a love that's inherently given 
A kind of blindness offered to appease 
And in that light of forbidden joy 
Oh I know I won't receive it

To have and to hold that precious little thing

Sarah McLachlan,"On the hills of fire the darkest hour 
I was dreaming of my true loves pyre 
Who will bring a light to stoke the fire 
Fear not for your still breathing 

On a windless day 
I saw the life blood drained away 
A cold wind blows on a windless day 

Hear the cry for new life the mourning's flame 
You were the brightest light that burned to soon in vain 
Who will bring you back from where there's no return 
Fear not for you just dreaming

And looks out as far as she can see 
And draws each breath as if it were the last 
And wipes away the tears across her sleeve 
She can see where the river crawls to the sea 
Like a baby into mothers care 
Somehow the longing is so far away 

The innocence so wasted and aware 
And look at the child with the dream in her eyes 
Holding it deep inside her 
Thinking about home, home
So much anger so deeply engrained 
Seemed a burden that was hers alone
 
She didn't thing that there was anything wrong 
With wanting a life that she could call her own 
How could I explain? You would not want to hear 
You wouldn't listen if I talked anyway 
For you were too weighed down by your own fears 

Look at the child with the dream in her eyes 
Holding it deep inside her

Sarah McLachlan,"I remember the nights I watched you lay sleeping 
Your body gripped by some far away dream 
Well I was so scared and so in love then 
And so lost in all of you that I had seen 

[Chorus]
But no one ever talked in the darkness 
No voice ever added fuel to the fire 
No light ever shone in the doorway 
Deep in the hollow of earthly desires 
But if in some dream there was brightness 
If in some memory some sort of sigh 
And flesh be revived in the shadows 
Blessed our bodies would lay so entwined 
And I will oh I will not forget you 
Nor will I ever let you go 
I will oh I will not forget you 

I remember when you left in the morning at daybreak 
So silent you stole from my bed 
To go back to the one who possesses your soul 
And I back to the life that I dread 
So I ran like the wind to the water 
Please don't leave me again I cried 
And I drew bitter tears at the ocean 
But all that came back was the tide

[Chorus]",I Will Not Forget You
Sarah McLachlan,"Crouching down inside a deep ravine
Those angry cries pass quickly by, he can't be seen
So many ways spent hiding in so many undone plans
Forgetting what it's like to fight when no one understands
Close call there in the shadows
There's a fear in the dark
There's one out there

All those memories, pain and anger, flood back one by one
They must be just around the bend, they always come
At night as I lay sleeping they come to me in herds
Their lies remain, the dreams the same, it's only fleeting words
No one calls there in the shadows
There's no end to the dark
But there's one out there, no one but me

The hours pass so slowly, the life's slipping out of me
No way's the right way. 
Is there a way out for me?
My life's slipping out

Rising up, the night is done, and now the bright lights come
Held back in my pitied world where everything's undone
A cold wind blows right through me, I'm made a hollow shell
There's nothing left, just ash remains, enrich the soil, no soil, no soil

Close call there in the shadows
There's an end to the dark
'Cause there's someone out there
Someone like me

The hours pass so slowly, the life's slipping out of me
No way's the right way, is there a way out for me
The hours pass so slowly
The life's slipping out of me
Is there a way out for me?
The hours pass so slowly
The life's slipping out of me
Is there a way out for me?
There must be a way out for me",Out of the Shadows
Sarah McLachlan,"I knew you wanted to tell me 
In your voice there was something wrong 
But if you would turn your face away from me 
You cannot tell me you're so strong
Just let me ask of you one small thing 
As we have shared so many tears 
With forever our dreams we planned a whole life long 
Now are scattered on the wind

[Chorus]
In the terms of endearment 
In the terms of the life that you love 
In the terms of the years that pass you by 
In the terms of the reasons why 

Through the years I've grown to love you 
Through your commitment to most would offend 
But I stuck by you holding on with my foolish pride 
Waiting for you to give in
You never really tried or so it seems 
I've had more than myself to blame 
I've had enough of trying everything 
And this time it is the end

[Chorus] 

There's no more coming back this way 
The path is overgrown and strewn with thorns 
They've torn the life blood from your naked eyes 
Cast aside to be forlorn

Funny, how it seems that all I've tried to do 
Seemed to make no difference to you at all",Path of Thorns (Terms)
Sarah McLachlan,"Mary walks 
Down to the water's edge 
And there she hangs her head 
To find herself faded 
A shadow of what she once was 
She said ""How long have I been sleeping 
And why do I feel so old 
Why do I feel so cold 
My heart is saying one thing but my body won't let go"" 
With trembling hands she reaches up 
A stranger's flesh is offered 
And I would be the last to know 
I would be the last the let it show 
I would be the last to go 
Take her hand 
She will lead you through the fire 
Give you back hope 
And hope that you won't take too much 
Respecting what is left 
She cradled us 
She held us in her arms 
Unselfish in her suffering she could not understand 
That no one seemed to have the time 
To cherish what was given 
And I would be the last to know 
And I would be the last to let it show 
I would be the last to go...

And the colors fade to black
And my eyes are falling fast and deep into me

And they wonder sometimes when they see all the
Sadness and pain that truth brings to light

'Cause I can't see no reason
What is blind cannot see
'Cause I want what is pleasing

What I'd steal from the womb

Would I drown in my shallow regret

Sarah McLachlan,"When we wore a heart of stone we wandered to the sea
Hoping to find some comfort there yearning to feel free
And we were mesmerized by the lull of the night and the smells that filled the air
And we laid us down on sandy ground it was cold but we didn't care

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn to the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea

We fell asleep and began to dream when something broke the night
Memories stirred inside of us, the struggle and the fight
And we could feel the heat of a thousand voices telling us which way to go
And we cried out is there no escape from the words that plague me so

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn to the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea

In the still and the silent dawn another day is born
Washed up by the tireless waves the body bent and torn
When you wake in the face of the blinding sun, and you search only to find
That heaven is a stranger place than what you've left behind

And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn to the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythm
Drawn into the rhythm of the sea
And we were drawn to the rhythum....

Don't let your life pass you by,
Weep not for the memories
Remember the good times that we had?
I let them slip away from us when things got bad.
How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun
Want to feel your warmth upon me
I want to be the one

I will remember you, will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so tired but I can't sleep
Standin' on the edge of something much to deep
It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word
We are screaming inside, but we can't be heard

I will remember you, will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so afraid to love you
But more afraid to lose
Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
Once there was a darkness
Deep and endless night
You gave me everything you had, oh you gave me life

Sarah McLachlan,"A time so haunting moonlight in the mist
Lay me down Beside you oh as long as it lasts
From the river comes a Figure drifting slowly by
Trailing long the water, leaving softer than a sigh
Softer than a sigh

All the feelings they remain like a still life
A dying swan song forever lost your cries of glory
The rain is falling down like silence in a shroud
When All that really matters left to lose
I'm all alone
I'm all alone

All the feelings they remain like a still life
A dying swan song forever lost your cries of glory
Walking from the shadows, a fear of sadness grows

My heart is telling you how much I wanted you

Milk and honey so intoxicating

Into the fire
I am the spark
Into the fire

Open the doors that lead on into eden
Don't want no cheap disguise
I follow the signs marked back to the beginning
No more compromise

And into the fire
I'm reunited
Into the fire
I am the spark
Into the night
I yearn for comfort

Free the water that carries me to the sea
You I see as my security

Into the fire
I'm reunited
Into the fire
I am the spark
Into the night
I yearn for comfort

I will stare at the sun until its light doesn't blind me
I will walk into the fire until its heat doesn't burn me
And I will feed the fire

Sarah McLachlan,"Adia I do believe I failed you
Adia I know I've let you down
Don't you know I tried so hard
To love you in my way
It's easy let it go

Adia I'm empty since you left me
Trying to find a way to carry on
I search myself and everyone
To see where we went wrong

'Cause there's no one left to finger
There's no one here to blame
There's no one left to talk to, honey
And there ain't no one to buy our innocence

'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me Adia, we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?

Adia I thought that we could make it
But I know I can't change the way you feel
I leave you with your misery
A friend who won't betray
I pull you from your tower
I take away your pain
And show you all the beauty you possess
If you'd only let yourself believe that

We are born innocent
Believe me Adia, we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter, does it matter?
Believe me Adia, we are still innocent
'Cause we are born innocent
Adia we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter, but does it matter?

'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me Adia, we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?

Sarah McLachlan,"Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay

There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard, at the end of the day

I need some distraction
Oh, beautiful release
Memories seep from my veins

And maybe empty
Oh, and weightless, and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back

The storm keeps on twisting
Keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack

It don't make no difference
Escape one last time
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness
Oh, this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees

In the arms of the angel

Sarah McLachlan,"You come out at night
That's when the energy comes
And the dark side's light
And the vampires roam
You strut your rasta wear
And your suicide poem
And a cross from a faith that died
Before Jesus came
You're building a mystery

You live in a church
Where you sleep with voodoo dolls
And you won't give up the search
For the ghosts in the halls
You wear sandals in the snow
And a smile that won't wash away
Can you look out the window
Without your shadow getting in the way?

You're so beautiful
With an edge and charm
But so careful
When I'm in your arms

'Cause you're working
Building a mystery
Holding on and holding it in
Yeah you're working
Building a mystery
And choosing so carefully

You woke up screaming aloud
A prayer from your secret god
You feed off our fears
And hold back your tears, oh
Give us a tantrum
And a know it all grin
Just when we need one
When the evening's thin

You're a beautiful
A beautiful fucked up man
You're setting up your
Razor wire shrine

'Cause you're working
Building a mystery
Holding on and holding it in
Yeah you're working

it is in pardoning that we are pardoned

You are pulled from the wreckage

Sarah McLachlan,"As the walls are closing in and the colors fade to black
As my eyes are falling fast and deep into me
And I follow the tracks that lead me down
I never follow what's right and they wonder sometimes
When they see all the sadness and pain, the truth begins to light

'Cause I can't see no reason what is blind cannot see
'Cause I want what is pleasin', all I take should be free
What I rob from the innocent ones
What I'd steal from the womb

As the walls are closing in and the colors fade to black
As the night is falling fast and deep into the sea
And in the darkness all that I can see, the frightened and the weak
Are forced to cling to mistakes they know nothing of
At mercy are the meek

'Cause I can't see no reason what is blind cannot see
'Cause I want what is pleasin', all I take should be free
What I rob from the innocent ones
What I'd steal from the womb

But for time being you're able to hold that

Sarah McLachlan,"Morning smiles
Like the face of a newborn child
Innocent unknowing

Winter's end
Promises of a long lost friend
Speaks to me of comfort

But I fear
I have nothing to give
I have so much to loose here in this lonely place
Tangled up in our embrace
There's nothing I'd like better than to fall

Wind in time
Rapes the flower trembling on the vine
And nothing yields to shelter it from above
They say temptation will destroy our love
The never ending hunger

But I fear
I have nothing to give
I have so much to loose here in this lonely place
Tangled up in our embrace
There's nothing I'd like better than to fall

I looked into your eyes
They told me plenty
I already knew
You never felt a thing
So soon forgotten all that you do
In more than words I
Tried to tell you
The more I tried I failed

I would not let myself believe
That you might stray
And I would stand by you
No matter what they'd say
I would've thought I'd be with you
Until my dying day
Until my dying day
Plenty, plenty, plenty

I used to think my life
Was often empty
A lonely space within
You hurt me more than
I ever would have imagined
You made my world stand still
And in that stillness
There was a freedom
I never felt before

I would not let myself believe
That you might stray
And I would stand by you

Witness me
I am outside
Give me peace

When the rage in me subsides

Chokes the flower
Until she cries no more
Possessing all the beauty
Hungry still for more

Heaven holds a sense of wonder
And I wanted to believe that I'd get caught up
When the rage in me subsides

I can't help this longing
Comfort me, I can't hold it all in
If you won't let me

And I wanted to believe that I'd get caught up
When the rage in me subsides

To keep me from falling
Into old familiar shoes

How stupid could I be?
A simpleton could see
That you're no good for me
But you're the only one I see

Love has made me a fool
Set me on fire and watched as I floundered
Unable to speak
Except to cry out and wait for your answer

But you come around in your time
Speaking of fabulous places, create an oasis
That dries up as soon as you're gone
You leave me here burning
In this desert without you

Find yourself with open arms
Find yourself, find yourself in time

How did I go so wrong in loving you?

Where every tongue is wagging

Following your aimless path away from us
You're so far away
And what can I say
Cause I can't be the one you wanted me to be

[Chorus]
So tell me how do you feel
It's so confusing
If you let it all go, it'll fall apart
Do you want me to stay and say I still want you
You want me too, don't you?

So what are we saying
Our Eden's a failure
A made-up story to fit the picture-perfect world
The one with ""I do""s
and I love you
And we are made for each other
Is forever over now?

[Chorus]

I hope there's forgiveness
In the distance between us
Can we make what lies ahead of us a better place to be?

[Chorus]",U Want Me 2
Sarah McLachlan,"The lake is frozen over
The trees are white with snow
And all around reminders of you
Are everywhere I go

It's late and morning's in no hurry
But sleep won't set me free
I lie awake and try to recall
How your body felt beside me
When silence gets too hard to handle
And the night too long

This is how I see you
In the snow on Christmas morning
Love and happiness surround you
As you throw your arms up to the sky
I keep this moment by and by
Oh I miss you now, my love
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, my love

Sense the joy fills the air
And I daydream and I stare
Up at the tree and I see
Your star up there

This is how I see you
In the snow on Christmas morning
Love and happiness surround you
As you throw your arms up to the sky
I keep this moment by and by",Wintersong
Sarah McLachlan,"I can't believe this moment's come
It's so incredible that we're alone
There's so much to be said and done
It's impossible not to be overcome
Will you forgive me if I feel this way
'cause we've just met - tell me that's OK
So take this feeling'n make it grow
Never let it - never let it go
(Dont let go of the things you believe in)
You give me something that I can believe in
(Dont' let go of this moment in time)
Go of this moment in time
(Don't let go of things that you're feeling)
I can't explain the things that I'm feeling
(Dont' let go)
No, I won't let go

Now would you mind if I bared my soul
If I came right out and said your'e beautiful
'cause there's something here I can't explain
I feel I'm diving into driving rain
You get my senses running wild
I can't resist your sweet, sweet smile
So take this feeling'n make it grow
Never let it - never let it go

I've been waiting all my life
To make this moment feel so right
The feel of you just fills the night
So see'mon - just hold on tight",Don't Let Go
Sarah McLachlan,"It's not that unusual
When everything is beautiful
It's just another ordinary miracle today

The sky knows when it's time to snow
Don't need to teach a seed to grow
It's just another ordinary miracle today

Life is like a gift they say
Wrapped up for you every day
Open up and find a way
To give some of your own love

Isn't it remarkable?
Like every time a raindrop falls
It's just another ordinary miracle today

Birds in winter have their fling
They always make it home in spring
It's just another ordinary miracle today

When you wake up everyday
Please don't throw your dreams away
Hold them close to your heart
Cause we are all a part of the ordinary miracle

Ordinary miracle
Do you want to see a miracle?

It seems so exceptional
The things just work out after all
It's just another ordinary miracle today

The sun comes up and shines so bright
And disappears again at night
It's just another ordinary miracle today

It's just another ordinary miracle today",Ordinary Miracle
Sarah McLachlan,"I hope my smile
can distract you
I hope my fists
can fight for two
So it never has to show
And you'll never know

I hope my love
can blind you
I hope my arms
can bind you
So you'll never have to see
What we've grown to be

One may think
we're alright
But we need pills
to sleep at night
We need lies
to make it through the day
We're not ok

One may think
we're doing fine
But if I had to lay it on the line
We're losing ground

One thing I would never
That's one thing
I would never say to you",Pills [Live] [Live]
Sarah McLachlan,"It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
singing songs of joy and peace

Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on

But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm going to make a lot of money
And then I'm going to quit this crazy scene

Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly high

Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on

I made my baby cry

He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees

Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on

But I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost
the best baby that I ever had

Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on

Oh I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly high

Oh I wish I had a river
That I could skate away on

I made my baby say goodbye

It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
singing songs of joy and peace

Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on",River [Version]
Sarah McLachlan,"When we first met the well was dry
A long dark winter passed us by
With shooting starts and hopeful hearts our worlds collide
And so we rushed to fill each other in
Quick to feed our hungry hopes
A feast of our affections we were born anew

Oh, whoa

With open eyes we tried to make it work
And for a while the magic took
But cracks to begin to show as soon as things got hard
Like paper walls our feelings tore
We threw our backs against the door
Unwilling to bear witness to the other side

Oh, the games we play to hide the tangled dread inside
The fear that we are going nowhere fast
So we point the finger out, the anger gets so loud 
It drowns out all the sorrow, at least until tomorrow, what then?

I took a good hard look at how I loved
Years I squandered falling fast
For any boy who'd have me was so insecure
I'd lie awake alone at night
Full of loathing, compromised
And wondering how the hell did I end up like this

Oh, the tears of rage I cried, when nowhere could I find
An answer that made any kind of sense to me
I point the finger out, the anger gets so loud
It drowns out all the sorrow, at least until tomorrow

Oh I wanna learn, I wanna know
Will our history crush us or can we let it go?
I'm not the girl I was but what have I become?
I'm not so willing anymore to bend
Still pleasing and conceding
But I'm not gonna lose myself again",Awakenings
Sarah McLachlan,"I can't believe that you're walking away from us
Could not conceive we'd ever be done
But I feel you drifting you don't have to hide from me
I just keep hoping you let me in

Maybe I, I can't help but talking, I am here for you

Time passes us by and the way we love changes
And we're learning to waltz through the waves like everyone
Let it keep us from falling
Would you dance with me now?

The candle burned out and we stumbled around in the dark
And I can feel you slipping away
The band keeps on playing the world keeps revolving
Around all the static, the noise in between

And we need to hear that song again, let the love shine through

Time passes us by and the way we love changes
And we're learning to waltz through the waves like everyone
Let it keep us from falling
Would you dance with me, dance with me now?

New walls new ladders, none of this matters
We can't walk on water, we can only do better
If it's not forever, if it's time to go I will always remember
I want you to know

When you held me in your arms and said,
Let the love shine through

Time passes us by and the way we love changes
And we're learning to waltz through the waves like everyone
Let it keep us from falling
Would you dance with me, dance with me now?
Would you dance with me, dance with me now?",Changes
Sarah McLachlan,"Loving, lying enemy
I have seen your face before
Never thought again I'd see
Didn't want to anymore

I remember your loving eyes
And the moonlit kiss
The evening lullabies I will truly miss
Through the years we had it all
The midnight whispers, the midday calls
This house of cards, it had to fall

And you ask for forgiveness
You're asking too much
I have sheltered my heart in a place you can't touch
I don't believe when you tell me your love is real
'Cause you don't know much about heaven, boy
If you have to hurt to feel

Every time I see you, I can't help but look away
All along I had believed everything you'd say
When I look now I know I've seen your face before
Don't want your deceiving smile, standing at my door

And I don't care what people say
I'm ready now to face this day
'Cause I have lost you along the way

And you ask for forgiveness
You're asking too much
I have sheltered my heart in a place you can't touch
I don't believe when you tell me your love is real

Sarah McLachlan,"Before the night comes, before the city sleeps
I walk a lonely mile
I know you're out there
I know you're waiting for me to make a sign

I know you'd like me to go and crumble
Reveal myself to you
I lost a wing and grew a shell on the wound
Oh so soon

And heartbreak no you can't catch me
Hot on my heels but I move too fast
I know you think that I would make good company, at last

You always come 'round after your good friend love
Has gone and run aground
A heart in shambles oh well it's just what you need
Your purpose found

You turn the lights down and draw the curtains
You put the kettle on
Come over here, sit down tell me your troubles
You sing the saddest song

And heartbreak no you can't catch me
Hot on my heals but I move too fast
I know you think that I would make good company, at last

I'm free to wander so get up off of your knees
And find some other fool
Someone who'll hold you when you've got no one to tease
It won't be me",Heartbreak

The wounds too hard to hear

Love has taken me in
Lifted my load
And in this empty place a wonder grows
A dream of some kind of peace
I could hold up as true

I can sense the flood before it breaks
And I'd do anything to dry your tears

The doorway that cleanses, the darkness that mends
It's easy to smile in the end

How long 'til you drown?

Take tolls on the highs we still strive 'til we die
To seek out the one love, the one that we dream of

Alone and untethered and free of all ties
Free since the day you first cried

There were always creatures lurking under the bed
A thousand year old dragon lived deep in the lake
And he said ""Don't be afraid""
So you dove in

And made you forget about the rain
Showed you new tricks on guitar
Hidden talents that erases the pain, ah

And don't you know that there's a wolf
Stalking in sheep's clothing
Tells me he's the real thing
Think what your life would be missing
If you didn't have him to sing
To sing about

Three headed monsters
They want your money wanna be in the picture
Be your friend
They fill your pool
With alligators are they all just jokers or are they cruel

They light up when they see you
Like there's no where else that they'd rather be
Than by your side
Then they promise you the stars
But they're really just along for the ride, ah

And don't you know that there's a wolf
Stalking in sheep's clothing
Tells me he's the real thing
Think what your life would be missing
If you didn't have him to sing
To sing about, ah ah

Ah ah, ah

Is it the sparkle
In their eyes or the knowledge of the ways of the world
The way they kiss
The way they hold you
Has made you blind to the fangs and the fire

There's a wolf
Stalking in sheep's clothing
Tells me he's the real thing
Think what your life would be missing
If you didn't have him to sing
To sing about, ah
Ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah, ah ah",Monsters
Sarah McLachlan,"How I wish that I could tell you
It’s to you that I would run
You were the place that I could always rest my head
When my world had come undone

‘Cause I’ve been wrestling with my demons
They’re telling me I have no choice
How I wish that I could lean upon you now
Amidst the chaos and the noise

Your light buried the dark
A constant unwavering heart

You were the well to cool my fury
Deep and calm your waters feel
Your quiet words a salve to soothe my wayward soul
It was there I learned to heal

Your light buried the dark
A constant unwavering heart

Oh I hope that you can hear me
Through the ravages of time
You have carried me though more than you could know
I still feel your hand in mine

Your light buried the dark
A constant unwavering heart

Your light buried the dark
A constant unwavering heart (Unwavering heart)",Song for My Father
Sarah McLachlan,"Can you hear it? This is the sound that love makes
The fingerprint of a snowflake
It paints a picture of you

Can you feel it? This is the flavor of sunshine
The way your body it moves mine
I can taste you in the coolest raindrops

One hand in the other unlike any other hand I know
I’m seeing the sun in all the darkest grey skies

This time I’m going in for the sweetest kill
I’m gonna eat till I get my fill
So delicious are my lips on your skin

One hand in the other unlike any other hand I know
I’m seeing the sun in all the darkest grey skies

Sweetness, this is the rhythm of thunder
From up above or down under
I love you",The Sound That Love Makes
Sarah McLachlan,"Smooth stones down by the waterside
Give in to ebb and flow
Collide in blindness embrace and part
No fear of letting go
There’s no fight to get ahead,
Nowhere that they’d rather be

Safe in the arms of surrender and certainty
Caught in a moment and sure they’ll be carried
Take me back down to the water to feel that sure
Of anything

I write your name down in the swollen sand
And I walk out in the waves
I know you’re here I feel you all around me
In this sea of soothing gray
I don’t even feel the cold
It’s warm as you wash over me

Safe in the arms of surrender and certainty
Caught in a moment and sure I’ll be carried
Take me back down to the water to feel that sure
Of anything

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh ah

Rain like tears stream down the windshield
As we pull out on the road
You were the star by which I light my way
So how do I find my way now?

Back in the arms of surrender and certainty
Caught in a moment but sure we’ll be carried
I want to know what it feels like to be that sure
Of anything

Ooh ah
Ooh ah
Ooh ah
Ooh",Surrender and Certainty
Sarah McLachlan,"Night falls heavy like an iron fist
The silence taut and frail
I weigh the depths of love and terror
In this test I cannot fail
'Cause there’s no map to guide the human heart
Down roads we’ve never been
Sometimes I feel I’m running blind but I’m trying

So turn the lights down low
Let the night come easy
Take my hand won’t you let me in
'Cause when the world comes crashing down inside your head
I’ll be right here right here for you

Words fall heavy out of tired mouths
Resigned to rage and roar
I see behind your eyes the tempest rising
And I can’t reach your shore
When all my good intentions fall apart
And I wind up on my knees
There’s nothing gained from being right but I’m trying

So turn the lights down low
Let the night come easy
Take my hand won’t you let me in
'Cause when the world comes crashing down inside your head
I’ll be right here, right here for you

So turn the lights down low
Let the night come easy
Take my hand won’t you let me in
'Cause when the world comes crashing down inside your head
I’ll be right here, I’ll be right here for you

Take my hand won’t you let me in
'Cause when the world comes crashing down inside your head
I’ll be right here, I’ll be right here waiting
Right here for you",Turn the Lights Down Low
Sarah McLachlan,"I went to the water's edge, forgot I couldn't swim
I went to the water's edge, all ready to jump in

I heard the wind howl
I saw my own reflection
I just can't see it now

You say it's the way of the world
To somehow co-exists
That eventually life unfurls
A path to happiness

So I whisper your little secret
And repeat it under my breath
I'll save it for you in my heart
In case we both forget

Oh, I wish you could wrap yourself around me
I am gripped by a loneliness
Oh, I wish you could wrap yourself around me

I went to the water's edge and then felt myself slip
I dreamed that I was floating, just coast until I grew fins
I want to catch this tide back home and feel you again

The pay is cheap, the lines are long, and, oh
I can't get a live voice on the phone

No time to stop and enjoy the hush
Of a quiet word
To let you know you're not alone

Shout it from the inside
Let's make a choice
To be the change we want to see
And all rejoice
To find the good in everyone

It's the season to be kind
But it feels like I'm walking on land mines
Just a step away from bringing on disaster
Everywhere the pressure builds
The years of galore, the guilt and tears
And, oh, just waiting for the dawn to break

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?

Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid

Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

Sarah McLachlan,"In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow
In the bleak midwinter, long ago

Angels and archangels may have gathered there
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air
But His mother only, in her maiden bliss
Worshipped the beloved with a kiss

Oh what can I give Him, poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb
If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part
Yet what I can I give Him, give my heart

On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams

Sarah Partridge,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be

Then you became the bored one
I was like a toy
That brought you joy one day

That you preferred to throw away

Blame it on my youth
If only just for you I did exist
Blame it on my youth

Like a child of three
You meant more than anything
All the world to me

All night and day

In the night, though we're apart,
There's a ghost of you within my haunted heart
Ghost of you, my lost romance,
Lips that laugh, eyes that dance

Dreams repeat a sweet but lonely song to me

Dreams are dust, it's you who must belong to me
And thrill my haunted heart,
Be still my haunted heart

Sarah Partridge,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

In a corner of the city
Twice a year she gets back home
Playing catch-up with the family

She tells her folks what they need to know
Her mother says she's much too thin
Her sisters ask about her beau
Her dad inquires, how's business been

She's thirty-three this time around
She's always been real good at listening
Her sense of humor never lets her down
Except sometimes there's something missing

Hey, middle ground
A place between up and down
She could be safe and sound
Oh, to know middle ground

For years she's been on her guard
She's kind of tense around the shoulders
She wonders why she works so hard
She counts the days 'til they promote her

She'll take a weekend now and then
To stay in bed and watch the reruns
She'll turn the phone off when guilt sets in
But Sunday always kinda leaves her let down

Hey, middle ground; a place between up and down
She could be safe and sound; oh, to know middle ground

She gave her heart away one time, and says that she hasn't seen it since
Love's a puzzle in her mind; the pieces match, but don't quite fit; hey...
And these days run thick or thin
It never rains, or else it's pouring
All her single friends are men
She thinks married girls are so damn boring

As I'm crying out for help
Grabbing hold of anything that looks

Your hand reaching for me, then I sing

The One who is stronger than the storm
My Hero, my only hope, You are
My Savior

The sea starts raging, I'm quickly fading
As I take my eyes off You
Reality kicks in and fear rises within
My soul and all of my faith is gone
But oh, once again You take my hand
You lead me to dry land, then I cry

The One who is stronger than the storm
My Hero, my only hope, You are

You never grow tired or weary
You always hear my cry
Forever You'll be there beside me

Even now I know this orbit that I'm in
Is spinning me to you
I am silenced by the will of my intent
To only be with you
Completely lost in you

Give them wings so they can fly to you
As I wait to find
All you have in mind for me to be

They offer no resistance
Take me up into your space

I didn't plan it, it just happened that way
I guess faith stepped in the end
'Cause I needed you then

When I bought him they said ""Are you sure?
No refunds, returns, or exchanges because once He's yours he's yours for good.""
Now you behave like an angel should

'Cause I saw it on TV
They were selling pieces of heaven
And I thought, ""Hey what about me?
What am I considered?""

It was November and I think I pissed him off
He's mad but I don't care
You're my angel so there

I figure its only about 60 more years
So come on angel, stop all the tears
Come sing me a song or two
Or whatever it is you angels do

They were selling pieces of heaven
And I thought, hey what about me
When can I make reservations

My pet angel's got a long lost friend
Who says he's coming back when the world ends
When us humans have lost our touch

I'd fight fire and wind and rain
I'd cry a river of tears for them

There are some things I can't forgive
Some things I just can't forgive

Just six or seven

Begin today
You'll find it nice
The quickest way to Paradise
When you practice
Here's the thing to know
Simply say as you go

[Chorus]
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day
I'm gonna get there at any price
Stand aside; I'm on my way
I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair
Shoes, go on and carry me there
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day

Every new step
Helps a bit, but any old kind of two-step
Does as well; it don't matter what step you step
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven
Get busy
Dance with Maud the countess or just plain Lizzy
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy
When you've learned to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out

In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance
Which beats the latest thing from France
Take no chances on this Paradise
Let me give you advice

[Chorus: x 2]",I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise

Of Timothy's and William's
Would be
To capture me

You wore down my resistance
I fell
And it was swell

How I won you I shall never, never know
It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and nighttime hear me sigh

You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine",The Best Is Yet to Come
Sarah Vaughan,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue

Sarah Vaughan,"Those fingers in my hair
That sly come-hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft

And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do?
'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although I know it's strictly taboo

When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what you're leading me to

It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you",Witchcraft
Sarah Vaughan,"Bye bye baby
Time to hit the road to dreamland
You're my baby

Dig you in the land of nod

Hold tight baby
We'll be swinging up in dreamland
All night baby

Where the little cherubs trot

Look at that knocked out moon
Been a-blowing his top in the blue

Never saw the likes of you

Bye bye baby
Time to hit the road to dreamland
Don't cry baby
It was divine but the rooster has finally crowed

Sarah Vaughan,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si.

Sarah Vaughan,"My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet your my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me

Sarah Vaughan,"It begins to tell 'round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well till after sundown
Supper time I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad 'round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it too

When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending?
Darlin', I need you; lately I find
You're out of my heart and I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings 'round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing for your returning

Sarah Vaughan,"Oh, the good life, full of fun
Seems to be the ideal
Yes, the good life lets you hide 
All the sadness you feel

You won't really fall in love
For you can't take the chance
So be honest with yourself
Don't try to fake romance

It's the good life 
To be free and explore the unknown
Like the heartaches 
When you learn you must face them alone

Please, remember, I still love you
And in case you don't know
Well, just wake up
Kiss the good life ""hello""",The Good Life
Sarah Vaughan,"The torch I carry is handsome
It's worth its heartache in ransom
And when that twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels

When I want rain, I get sunny weather
I'm just as blue as the sky
Since love is gone, can't get myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

Friends ask me out and I tell them I'm busy
Must get a new alibi
I stay at home and ask myself, ""Where is she?""
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops
Hanging on a stream of dreams
Fly little memories, my little memories
Remind her of our crazy schemes

Yes, somebody says, just forget about her
So I gave that treatment a try
And strangely enough I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by, oh, well
I guess I'll hang my tears out to dry",I Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry

Sarah Vaughan,"Ah, sweet mystery of life, at last I've found thee
Ah, I know at last the secret of it all

Sarah Vaughan,"(and as the sun goes down I cry myself to sleep)
I watch the bugs crawling across my skin
Now that you are gone, I can let things crumble
And though it seems that this was meant to be
It's so hard to see and all I do is stumble

The candles burn but it's still too dark
I have given up so it's not worth trying
I'll face the truth when I think I can
Try to understand what I love denying

I'm only
Falling through the cracks
I'm only
Losing my will to live
I'm only
Broken and beaten down
I'm only... I'm only

I've got to go this place is poison now
Now that you are gone and your ghost ignores me
I beg and plead with eternity
But this fantasy I see abhors me

The visions come during day or night
Angels, devils pray on my weak condition
And out of reach there's a tiny light
That could set things right if I could change position

I'm only
Falling through the cracks
I'm only
Losing my will to live
I'm only
Broken and beaten down
I'm only... I'm only

If only the sun could spare me this pain
I would open up the doors and let him in
And look into his eyes
Just burn away your lies
Tear you from my heart and from my soul

Losing my will to live

Long as stars are in the blue
Long as there's a spring, a bird to sing
I'll go on loving you

Till the end of time
Long as roses bloom in May
My love for you will grow deeper
With every passing day

Till the wells run dry
And each mountain disappears
I'll be there for you, to care for you
Through laughter and through tears

So take my heart in sweet surrender
And tenderly say that I'm
The one you love and live for

I long to try something I've never had
Never had no kissin'
Oh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be? 

The night is so cold and I'm so alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be? 

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
And whisper sweet
Little things in my ear

You be","Lover Man [Live atCopenhagen, 1963]"
Sarah Vaughan,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty just holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love

I'm just too misty and too much in love","Misty [Live at Copenhagen, 1963]"
Sarah Vaughan,"The sleepless nights, the daily fights
The quick toboggan when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving and the hateful hates
The conversation with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punch drunk

The pulled-out fur of cat and cur
The fine mis-mating of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words ""I love you, till the day I day""
The self-deception that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punch drunk

Believe me, sir, I much prefer
The classic battle of a him and her
I don't like quiet and I wish I were
In love again, in love again, in love again",I Wish I Were in Love Again

Let's find a cozy spot
To cuddle and coo

And the beetle bugs are zooming
And the tulip trees are blooming
And there's not another human in view,
But us two
It's a lazy afternoon
And the farmer leaves his reaping
And the meadow cows are sleeping
And the speckled trouts stop leaping up stream
As we dream
A far pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfolding like a rose
If you hold my hand and sit real still,
You can hear the grass as it grows
It's a hazy afternoon
And i know a place that's quiet, except for daisies running riot
And there's no one passing by it to see
Come spend this lazy afternoon with me

Sarah Vaughan,"I can't believe that you're not here with me
To have a laugh or share a tear with me

To never see your funny face again
To never thrill to your embrace again
Oh, it's so wrong it can't be right
It must have been something I dreamed last night

Those midnight suppers for two
Our silly duets at dawn
Those crazy moments with you
Don't tell me that they are gone

To never look into those eyes again
The sun might just as well not rise again
Oh, no, no, no, it can't be right

Once you awake in someone's arms
Once you have shared the dawn

Can you walk alone across the miles of time?

What other song will do?
After your eyes are dazzled by the summer sunlight - oh how long before they grow accustomed to the dark of winter?

Your lips were warm, and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget, but I won't be lonely

Sarah Vaughan,"Couldn't they do away with April
Leave no space, so there's no trace of April
Couldn't they take March
And make it twice as long

'Cause when April finds me
April will just remind me
Of a love that went wrong
(Dunno why it just went wrong)

Love is gone, so why go on with April
Wouldn't Paris be just as nice in May, sing
Couldn't they take April and throw it away

Sarah Vaughan,"Someday we'll build a home on a hilltop high, you and I
Shiny and new a cottage that two can fill
And we'll be pleased to be called
""The folks who live on the hill""

Someday we may be adding a thing or two, a wing or two
We will make changes as any family will
But we will always be called
""The folks who live on the hill""

Our veranda will command a view of meadows green
The sort of view that seems to want to be seen
And when the kids grow up and leave us
We'll sit and look at the same old view
Just we two

The folks like to be called

Sarah Vaughan,"A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sitting there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight
And no one there you can kiss good night

A room is still a room
Even when there's nothing there but gloom
But a room is not a house
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart

Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
When it ends it ends in tears

Darling, have a heart
Don't let one mistake keep us apart
I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stair and turn the key
Oh, please, be there, still in love with me",A House Is Not a Home

Often I've had to caress men
Five or ten, dollars then, I'd collect from all those yes-men

Darling, can't you see?
'Twas for charity?
Though these lips have made slips, it was never really serious
Who'd have thought, I'd be brought to a state that's so delirious?

I could cry salty tears
Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been goin' on?

There were chills up my spine
And some thrills I can't define

Warmer than the Summer night.
The clouds were like an alabaster palace,
Rising to a snowy height.
Each star its own Aurora Borealis,
Suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me,
Or was that a moonlit veil?
The music of the universe around me,
Or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,
Suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night?
It's still a thrill I don't quite believe;
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve!

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember,
And the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But oh, my darlin', always I'll remember
When your lips were close to mine,
And I saw the midnight sun.

With distinguish traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away

To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me

Again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again

I should stay away, but what can I do?

Sarah Vaughan,"Our waltz is music fashioned in heaven,
Angels composed it for us to dance to.
Our waltz is moonlight trembling with kisses,
Each note a heartbeat throbbing with love.

Angels were watching one day,
And our love was their inspiration!

Our love is Springtime filled with a promise,
Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone
Our waltz will play on.

Sarah Vaughan,"You're clear out of this world
When I'm looking at you
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew

You're right out of a book
The fairy tale I read when I was five
No armored knight out of a book
Was more enchanted by a Loralei
Then I

After waiting so long
For the right time
After reaching so long for a star
All at once from long and lonely night time
And despite time, here you are

I cry, ""out of this world""

So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two
With you",Out of This World

Sarah Vaughan,"There's a story told of a little Japanese
Sitting demurely 'neath the cherry blossom trees
Miss Butterfly's her name
A sweet little innocent child was she
'Till a fine young American from the sea
To her garden came

They met 'neath the cherry blossoms everyday
And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with her soul t'was easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

Poor butterfly
'Neath the blossoms waiting
Poor Butterfly
For she loved him so
The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low

The moon and I know that he'll be faithful
I'm sure he'll come to me by and by
But if he won't come back, then I'll never sigh or cry
I just must die

Still I want to hear it from you

Everyone is saying you don't love me
Say it isn't so

Everywhere I go, everyone I know
Whispers that you're growing tired of me

People say that you
Found somebody new

Sarah Vaughan,"I see a change is coming to our lives
It's not the same as it used to be
And it's not too late to realise our mistake
We're just not right for each other

Love has slipped away left us only friends
We almost seem like strangers
All that's left between us are the memories we shared
Of times we thought we cared for each other

There's nothing left to do but go our separate ways
And pick up all the pieces left behind us
And maybe someday, somewhere along the way
Another love will find us

Some day when she's older, maybe she will understand
Why her mom and dad are not together
The tears that she will cry when I have to say goodbye
Will tear at my heart forever

And pick up all the pieces left behind us
And maybe someday, somewhere along the way
Another love will find us

Sarah Vaughan,"The leaves of brown came tumbling down
Remember
That September in the rain
The sun went out just like a dying ember

The raindrops seemed to play a sweet refrain
Though spring is here, to me it's still September

Sarah Vaughan,"Speak low when you speak, love
Our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
Speak low when you speak, love
Our moment is swift; like ships adrift, we're swept apart too soon

Speak low, darling, speak low
Love is a spark lost in the dark too soon, too soon
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here and always too soon

Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time a thief

We're late, darling, we're late
The curtain descends, everything ends too soon, too soon
I wait, darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me? Speak love to me and soon

Sarah Vaughan,"Thanks for the memory
Of things I can't forget, journeys on a jet
Our wondrous week in Martinique and Vegas and roulette
How lucky I was

And thanks for the memory
Of summers by the sea, dawn in Waikiki
We had a pad in London, but we didn't stop for tea
How cozy it was

Now since our breakup, I wake up
Alone on a gray morning-after
I long for the sound of your laughter
And then I see the laugh's on me

But thanks for the memory
Of every touch and thrill; I've been through the mill
I've lived a lot and learned a lot; you loved me not and still
I miss you so much

Thanks for the memory
Of how we used to jog even in a fog
That barbecue in Malibu away from all the smog
How rainy it was

Thanks for the memory
Of letters I destroyed, books that we enjoyed
Tonight, the way things look, I need a book by Sigmund Freud
How brainy he was

Gone are those evenings on Broadway
Together we'd go to a great show
But now I begin with the Late Show
And wish that you were watching too

I know it's a fallacy
That grown men never cry; baby, that's a lie
We had our bed of roses, but forgot that roses die
And thank you so much",Thanks for the Memory

And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie,

Has gone off and undone you

And never a new love will
Be the same

Step into my fantasy and, baby, don't let me go

Feels like we've started a party and covered the city with dreams

I don't want the dark to turn to light

Gonna make the city ours tonight

When you are all alone
Maybe the one who is waiting for you will prove untrue

Wishing that I were near, then
Maybe you'll ask me to come back again
And maybe I'll say maybe",Maybe

Why the thrill when you say Hello?

Why this joy when you touch my cheek?
I must tell you what my heart knows is true
Mister Wonderful, that's you.

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,

I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Sarah Vaughan,"I look at you and suddenly something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and your glance make this romance too hot to handle
Stars in the night blazing their light can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle
You've got me flyin' high and wide on a magic carpet ride

Full of butterflies inside
Want to cry, want to croon, want to laugh like a loon

Just when I think I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon, deep in your eyes, blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon

The other woman
Keeps fresh-cut flowers in each room

He'll find her waiting
Like a lonely queen
And when he's by her side

One night perfect for romancing
The night a sinner kissed an angel
He wanted thrills, she wanted love

Oh, but his sighs were tender
As he begged her to surrender

And she believed that it was love

How was she to know that every lovely vow
Was part of the game he was playing?

It's too deep to express
And when he tries to use his eyes

So full of passion these pupils are
That girls forget what their scruples are

I murmur tenderly

I think you're great; I think you're grand
And I don't mind if you hold my hand
But don't look at me that way

Your kisses, too, are heavenly
And, oh, so full of variety
But don't look at me that way

When you tell me sweetly you're mine completely
I always give a long cheer
But those sudden flashes behind your lashes
Are nobody's business, dear

Since you began to play your role
I've lost my heart and I've lost my soul
But as for losing my self-control
Don't look at me that way

I just adore your loving arms
In fact they're two of your greatest charms
But don't look at me that way

I'm very mild, I'm very meek
My will is strong, but my wont is weak
So don't look at me that way

When that strange expression of indiscretion
Begins to show in your stare
There's a hocus-pocus about your focus

Others will bicycle side by side out to some romantic spot

Let's take an old fashioned walk; I'm just bursting with talk
What a tale could be told if we went for an old fashioned walk
Let's take a stroll through the park, down a lane where it's dark
And a heart that's controlled may relax on an old fashioned walk

I know for a couple who seem to be miles apart
There's nothing like walking and having a heart-to-heart
I know a girl who declined, couldn't make up her mind
She was wrapped up and sold coming home from an old fashioned walk

I used to dream of a millionaire, handsome and rich from the States
Taking me out for a breath of air, saying, ""The carriage awaits""

Sarah Vaughan,"Before Lord God made the sea or the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air
For the little dark star in the wind down there
And he stated and promised he'd take special care
So it wouldn't get lost no more

Now a man don't mind if the stars get dim
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over him
Keeping track how it all goes on

But I've been walking through the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
Forgetting his promise and the word he'd say

Sarah Vaughan,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall

There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet

Sitting on the dresser
I opened it
It simply read

And all that I am left with
Is how I let her go 
And the letter she wrote
Saying you'll find me

I spent the next eight hours wondering 
Where on earth you were
It was getting late, I was getting tired 
And growing more concerned
When all at once it hit me, 
That piano bar back home
Where I asked you to marry me
And there you were alone

I knew I would find you
And how it warmed my heart
To see you right there 
Waiting for me with open arms
Said I don't know where I'm going,

Is something I just can't live with

Sarah Vaughan,"I never knew the charm of spring
I never met it face to face
I never knew my heart could sing
I never missed a warm embrace

Till April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom
Holiday tables under the trees
April in Paris, this is a feeling 
That no one can ever reprise

I never knew the charm of spring
I never met it face to face
I never knew my heart could sing
I never missed a warm embrace

Till April in Paris

What have you done to my heart?",April in Paris
Sarah Vaughan,"They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi ho, alas, and also lackaday
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Sarah Vaughan,"Darn that dream I dream each night
You say you love me and hold me tight
But when I awake and you're out of sight
Oh, darn that dream

Darn your lips and darn your eyes
They lift me high above the moonlit sky
Then I tumble out of paradise
Oh, darn that dream

Darn that one-track mind of mine
I can't understand that you don't care
Just to change the mood I'm in
I'd welcome a nice old nightmare

Darn that dream and bless it too
Without that dream I never have you
But it haunts me and it won't come true
Oh, darn that dream",Darn That Dream
Sarah Vaughan,"I'll never smile again
Until I smile at you
I'll never laugh again
What good would it do?

For tears would fill my eyes
My heart would realize
That our romance is true

I'll never love again
I'm so in love with you
I'll never thrill again
To somebody new

Sarah Vaughan,"Your sweet expression, the smile you gave me
The way you looked when we met
It's easy to remember, but so hard to forget

I hear you whisper, ""I'll always love you""
I know it's over and yet
It's easy to remember, but so hard to forget

So I must dream to have your hand caress me
Fingers press me tight
I'd rather dream than have the lonely feeling
Stealing through the night

Each little moment is clear before me
And though it brings me regret
It's easy to remember, and so hard to forget

So I must dream to have your hand caress me

Sarah Vaughan,"Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours
Don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim

Jim never tells me I'm his heart's desire
I never seem to set his love afire
Gone are the years I've wasted on him
Sometimes when I get feelin' low
I say let's call it quits
Then I hang on and let him go 
Breakin' my heart in bits

Someday I know that Jim will up and leave me
But even if he does you can believe me
I'll go on carrying the torch for Jim

I'll go on lovin' my Jim",Jim
Sarah Vaughan,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?

I am his forever more",My Man
Sarah Vaughan,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Sarah Vaughan,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody

My true love was true
I of course reply
Something inside
Cannot be denied

They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them
And I gayly laughed
To think they could doubt
To think they could doubt my love

But today
My love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies

Sarah Vaughan,"My ship has sails that are made of silk
The decks are trimmed with gold
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing

I do not care if that day arrives

My own true love to me
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me",My Ship

And still be friends

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by

To keep love and romance forever alive

I lost it way down in Torido
While chancing a dance fiesta

High was the sun when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Perdido, since then has my heart been perdido
I know I must go to Torido, that yearning to lose perdido
I look for my heart it's perdido

Sarah Vaughan,"My story is much too sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold

When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me, why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick, though it's clear to me you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane; flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do, yet I get a kick out of you

Your every plan I design
Promise you'll always continue
To be mine

When two lips of coral want to kiss?

Said I do to love,
Don't ever call again.
For I must have you
Or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

I've locked my heart.
I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.
Emotion.

Did you good by the spring 
And all it meant to me
a good neighbor 
The things that used to be.
For I must have you or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.
That's why I'm thru with love.",I'm Through With Love
Sarah Vaughan,"All of me
Why not take all of me?
Can't you see
I'm no good without you

Take my lips
I want to lose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them

Your goodbye
Left me with eyes that cry
How can I
Get along without you?

You took the part
That once was my heart
So why not
Why not take all of me?",All of Me [Live]
Sarah Vaughan,"Day in, day out
That same old voodoo follows me about
That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you
And, baby, I think of you
Day in and day out
Day out, day in

I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I get up with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you
Come rain, come shine

I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips, and the pounding becomes
An ocean's roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love? Can there be any doubt?
When there it is day in, day out",Day In - Day Out

Uh-oh

Just to say I'm sorry

Sarah Vaughan,"It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells
That now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those night
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon
On gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot, not to cool down

So goodbye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

Sarah Vaughan,"Love you madly
Right or wrong
Sounds like a lyric of a song
But since it's so

And that's for sure

Sarah Vaughan,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud; I can't understand
I get misty just holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello, that music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost?
That's why I'm following you

On my own I would wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left, my hat from my glove
I'm too misty and too much in love
I'm too misty and too much in love",Misty [Live]
Sarah Vaughan,"Each time I look at you 
Is like the first time
Each time you're near me 
The thrill is new

And there is nothing 
That I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight 
Of you for

The more I see you
The more I want you
Somehow this feeling 
Just grows and grows
With every sigh 
I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

Sarah Vaughan,"Every day seems like a year
Sweetheart, when you are not near
All that you claim must be true
For I'm just the same as you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Stars are smiling at me from your eyes
Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

Sarah Vaughan,"Did you say that I've got a lot to learn?
Well, don't think I'm trying not to learn 
Since this is the perfect spot to learn 
Teach me tonight 

Starting with the A-B-C of it 
Getting right down to the X-Y-Z of it 
Help me solve the mystery of it 
Teach me tonight 

The sky's a blackboard high above you 
And if a shooting star goes by 
I'll use that star to write ""I love you"" 
A thousand times across the sky 

One thing isn't very clear, my love 
Teachers shouldn't stand so near, my love 
Graduation's almost here, my love 
You'd better teach me tonight 

I've played loves scenes in a flick or two 
And I've also met a chick or two 
But I still can learn a trick or two 
Hey, teach me tonight 

I who thought I knew the score of it 
Kind of think I should know much more of it 
Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it 
Hey, teach me tonight 

The midnight hours come slowly creeping 
When there's no one there but you 
There must be more to life than sleeping 
Single in a bed for two 

What I need most is post graduate 
What I feel is hard to articulate 
If you want me to matriculate 
You'd better teach me tonight 

What do you get for lessons?

Come on and teach me

Sarah Vaughan,"I was a humdrum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the Lord in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near

And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still?",What Is This Thing Called Love? [Live]
Sarah Vaughan,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last?
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past?
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew

It's you or no one for me

Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Please, don't say no to my plea
'Cause if you do, then I'm all through

Sarah Vaughan,"When days are long and nights are lonely
And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

And though our meeting is left to chance
Until our meeting 
I still will have my dream romance
And through the night I pray to the moon above
To please be kind and find the one I love",The One I Love (Belongs to Someone Else)

Falling in love with love is playing the fool
Caring too much is such a juvenile fancy

I was unwise with eyes unable to see

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

Every honeybee 
Fills with jealousy, 
When they see you out with me! 
I don't blame them, goodness knows, 
Oh, honey! suckle rose! 

When you're passin' by, 
Flowers droop and sigh 
And I know the reason why, 
You're my sweety, goodness knows, 
Oh, honey! suckle rose! 

I don't buy sugar, 
You just have to touch my cup; 
I don't need sugar, 
It's sweet enough when you stir it up! 
When I'm taking sips 
From your dainty lips, 
Seems the honey fairly drips, 
You're confection, goodness knows, 
Oh, honey! suckle rose.

Sarah Vaughan,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above

Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music

That everybody knows
The people know the part I'm playing

You paid for every dance
Selling each romance
Every night from heart betraying

Youth will pave away
Then what will it be about me, baby?

When the end comes, I know
There will just another gigolo
And life goes on without me","Just a Gigolo [Recorded Live at ""Mister Kellly's"", Chicago]"
Sarah Vaughan,"I'm scared--I'm shakin' in my boots
I'm scared--I'm frightened to the roots
My knees are knock, knockin' so nervously
I never thought your lovin' would do this to me

Look here; I tremble with such fright
See here; you'd better hold me tight
I never shook, shook this way before
So kiss me, kiss me, baby; make me shake some more

You whisper so soft that I grow fearful
Each time you give my heart a tender earful
I go around in circles like a weather vane
And then you send me like a jet propulsion plane

I'm scared; I show it in each sigh
I'm scared; I'll bet you wonder why

I'm scared to death that some day you'll stop lovin' me",I'm Scared
Sarah Vaughan,"It's love, it's love
Well, who would've thought it?
If this is love then why have I fought it
What a way to feel I could touch the sky
What a way to feel I have found my guy

It's love at last I have someone to cheer for
It's love at last I've learned what I'm here for
I've heard it said, ""You know it when you see it""
Well, I see it and I know it, it's love

Well, who would've thought it?
If this is love then why have I fought it

Sarah Vaughan,"Dinner is ended, the music is grand
Softly the lantern's gleam
Isn't it splendid to sit hand in hand
Silently lost in a dream?

Hands across the table
While the lights are low
Though you hush your lips, your fingertips
Tell me all I want to know

Hands across the table
Meet so tenderly
And they say in their little way 
That you belong to me

Silence is golden, so do not reply
And I shall understand
All can be told in a look of your eye
And in a touch of your hand

Hand across the table
While the lights are low
Though you hush your lips, your fingertips
Tell me all I want to know

Hands across the table
Meet so tenderly
And they say in their little way 
That you belong to me",Hands Across the Table
Sarah Vaughan,"Spending these lonesome evenings
With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up
All by myself

Dreaming that you're beside me
I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up
All by myself

What is the good of me by myself?

Why was I born?
Why am I living?
What do I get?
What am I giving?

Why do I want a thing
I daren't hope for?
What can I hope for?
I wish I knew

Why do I try
To draw you near me?
Why do I do I cry?
You never hear me

But what can I do?

To love you?

Sarah Vaughan,"I feel so smoochie 
When I hold your hand and look in your eye
I feel so smoochie
When I touch your lips, then I realize
That to hold you near
Makes rainbows appear

And life is just one long kiss
While the moon look down
And the stars kind of frown
And say, ""Golly, look what we miss""

I feel so smoochie
When the night is cool, it's always warm here with you
I feel so smoochie
And a seat for one becomes a love seat for two
And I know my career
Starts and ends right here
Right in your lovin' arms

Smoochie, little girl me
Smoochie, old gal to you

I feel so smoochie
When you hold me tight and muss up my hair
I feel so smoochie
A romantic song becomes our love affair
And a ride in our jeep
While the kiddie's asleep

Ends with parking at some dark curb
Then a sleepy old bird
Whispers 'round the word
And says, ""Quiet, please, don't disturb""

I feel so smoochie
When I dream all day of lovin' you at night
I feel so smoochie
Both my feet are wrong but I feel so right
Then I know my career
Starts and ends right here
Right in your lovin' arms

Smoochie, little girl me
Smoochie, old gal to you",I Feel So Smoochie
Sarah Vaughan,"Love me or leave me or let me be lonely
You won't believe me and I love you only
I'd rather be lonely
Than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time
The right time for kissin'
But night time is my time for just reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin' with somebody else

There'll be no one unless
That someone is you

Soft as stars in April skies are
Tell me someday you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill

Star eyes, flashing eyes in which my hopes rise
Let me show you where my heart lies
Let me prove that it adores
That lovingness of yours

Sarah Vaughan,"When Sunny gets blue, her eyes get gray and cloudy
Then the rain begins to fall, pitter-patter, pitter-patter
Love is gone; what can matter?
No sweet lover-man comes to call

When Sunny gets blue, she breaths a sigh of sadness
Like the wind that stirs the trees
Wind that sets the leaves to swaying 
Like some violin is playing strange and haunting melodies

People used to love to hear her laugh, see her smile
That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair, she lost her smile, changed her style
Somehow she's not the same

When Sunny gets blue, pretty dreams will rise up 
Where her other dreams fell through
Hurry, new love, hurry here to kiss away each lonely tear
And hold her near when Sunny gets blue

This thought that's been a-stealing
Through my brain
Is not to be ignored

But to really tell the truth
Though I'm not a well-known sleuth
I honestly believe
That you are bored

You've changed
That sparkle in your eye is gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart
You've changed

You've changed
You're kisses now are so blase
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand
You've changed

You've forgotten the words ""I love you""
Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you
I can't realize you've ever cared

You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me that we're through
It's all over now
You've changed",You've Changed
Sarah Vaughan,"Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

Cream colored ponies and crisp apple streudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

The best years of my life
You just wasted away
You caused so many tears
Now the time has come when you must pay

Ain't no more for you say
Ain't no more for you to say
Just take your love and go away

And it's time
We can leave
Don't return
Baby, it ain't no use
If you leave, don't return

Lost in a dream of you
Where is the love I knew
Why did we part?

What's in my heart

Must I have sleepless nights and endless days?
Oh love why did you leave my soul without a spark?

How you could love me, then leave me

Sarah Vaughan,"Sunday is gloomy; my hours are slumber-less
Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is Sunday--with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep; let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming, I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you asleep in the deep of my heart here
Darling, I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you

The green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time to be courtin' a girl of your own.

We were like children posing
Playing at games, acting out names
Guessing the parts we played

Oh, what a hit we made
We came on next to closing
Best on the bill, lovers until
Love left the masquerade

Fate seemed to pull the strings
I turned and you were gone

That music box played on

Sad little serenade
Song of my heart's composing
I hear it still; I always will

Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you

Hey there
You with the stars in your eyes
Love's never made a fool of you
You used to be too wise. 

Hey there
You on that high-flying cloud 
Though she won't throw a crumb to you
You think someday she'll come to you. 

Better forget her
Her with her nose in the air
She's got you dancing on a string
Break it and she won't care 

Won't you take this advice

Or are you not seeing things too clear?
Are you too much in love to hear?
Is it all going in one ear
And out the other?

As he walked away

And touched him
Then lost him, somehow

Until she came between

When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.

When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

And then quite suddenly I saw you, and I dreamed of gay amor.
At dawn I'll wake up singing sentimental overtures.

I taste the wine of real romancing now.
Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design.
As long as life endures, it's yours this heart of mine.

There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to minor,

Sarah Vaughan,"Autumn in New York
Why does it seem so inviting?
Autumn in New York
It spells the thrill of first-nighting

In canyons of steel
They're making me feel

It lifts you up when you run down

Transforms the slums into Mayfair

That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind
And once you told me I was mistaken

That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself

Now I even have to scratch my back myself
Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again

Sarah Vaughan,"There's a story told of a little Japanese
Sitting demurely 'neath the cherry blossom trees
Miss Butterfly's her name
A sweet little innocent child was she
'Till a fine young American from the sea
To her garden came

They met 'neath the cherry blossoms everyday
And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with her soul t'was easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

Poor butterfly
'Neath the blossoms waiting
Poor Butterfly
For she loved him so
The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low

The moon and I know that he'll be faithful
I'm sure he'll come to me by and by
But if he won't come back, then I'll never sigh or cry
I just must die
Poor butterfly",Poor Butterfly {From the Big Show of 1916}
Sarah Vaughan,"They say that falling in love is wonderful
It's wonderful, so they say
And with a moon up above it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand
And

The thing that's known as romance is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And without any warning
You're stopping people, shouting that love is grand
And

To hold a girl in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say",They Say It's Wonderful {From Annie Get Your Gun}
Sarah Vaughan,"When you shall see flowers that lie on the plain
Lying there, sighing for one touch of rain
Then you may borrow some glimpse of my sorrow
And you'll understand
How I long for the touch of your hand

I've loved you so; you'll never know
How through those far-ways
And strange star-ways
On sea or on land
I will long for the touch of your hand",The Touch of Your Hand {From Roberta}
Sarah Vaughan,"Day in, day out
That same old voodoo follows me about
That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you
And, baby, I think of you
Day in and day out
Day out, day in

I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I get up with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you
Come rain, come shine

I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips, and the pounding becomes
An ocean's roar, a thousand drums

Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you

Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

But nevertheless why stir up memories?

Might have gone but what for?

Sarah Vaughan,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots & Moonbeams
Sarah Vaughan,"There's a silver trail of moonlight leading upward to the sky
And the night is like a velvet lullaby
There's a heaven of blue
And we'll go there, just you and I

Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song

We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream
And settle high on the crest of a thrill?

Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars
It would be heaven to climb to heaven with you

Sarah Vaughan,"I'm feeling mighty lonesome
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
And in between I drink
Black coffee

Love's a hand-me-down brew
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room

I'm talking to the shadows
One o'clock to four
And lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee

Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hanging out on Monday
My Sunday dream's too dry

Now, a man is born to go a-loving
A woman's born to weep and fret
To stay at home and tend her oven
And drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes

I'm moody all the morning
Mourning all the night
And in between, it's nicotine
And not much hard to fight
Black coffee

Feeling low as the ground
It's driving me crazy
Just waiting for my baby
To maybe come around

My nerves have gone to pieces
My hair is turning gray
All I do is drink black coffee
Since my man's gone away",Black Coffee (Disc 01)
Sarah Vaughan,"Oh Lord, oh Lord
I'm tired and weary of pain
Please Lord, please Lord
Forgive me if I complain

Up in the mornin', out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day

Fuss with my man, toil for my kids
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day

Good Lord above, can't you know I'm pining
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining
Lift me to paradise

Show me that river, take me across
And wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day",That Lucky Old Sun

So if you want to go walking, dear,

The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse.

If not that's fine won't let it hold me down
The mold I'm breakin out stereotypes
Like she can't rip the mic she's white
Get it right come to a show
Come to a session at the studio watch me flow
Watch the record sales watch me blow
Watch me get em all sayin oohh look at her go
It ain't like that at first till I drop that first verse
Then cats eyes pop out like they brain gon burst
Get up in the club bout to rip a show up
They don't even know what I'm there for
Girls be like I can't believe she showed up
What's she doin here who let her in
Don't she see she don't belong yo she don't fit in
I don't fit in anywhere but everywhere at the same time
'Cause all different types of people vibe off the same rhyme

Instead of black and white could it be me and you
Look inside my soul tell me what's visible
Don't put me with the rest I'm an individual
Sometimes the best things lie beyond the physical

People like you aren't supposed to do what you do
People like me what the fuck people like you
That prejudge and can't get beyond the color lines
Corrupt children and they children's minds spread through bloodlines
Hatred is not an instinct
Get some education for ya ass and then tell me what ya think
Learn from those I come in contact watch for attack
Keep my guard up down for combat
Can't back away 'cause they don't see it my way
Or they not used to people like me comin they way
Only hate 'cause people fear the unknown
But fear drive me to take a chance and be bold
Try to knock me down gotta stay on my toes
Prevail winner of the game 'cause they think I'm gon fold
More than you see more than skin and bones
More than blood more than flesh I'm soul

Don't put me with the rest I'm an individual
Sometimes the best things lie beyond the physical

Yeah it gets rough being the minority's tough
Yeah there's been times I felt like I had enough
Bout to give up but I held strong

Me and my roommate stand out in the complex
Ain't no thing I relate through rhyme contest
Earn my respect through rhymes
Rhymes help me get through times
When ignorant people creep under my skin and get to mines
I don't understand they mind state
Talk about both sides of the board dog they make me irate
Need to pick up a book and work they intellect
And let respect gain respect

Instead of black and white could it be me and you
Look inside my soul tell me what's visible
Don't put me with the rest I'm an individual
Sometimes the best things lie beyond the physical

Sarai,"I'm about to shock the world
Bring it to ya now
Jaws drop when you see this girl
Big like whoa gotcha shook like I ain't know 
Girls that look like that could flow
Causin' chaos Sarai off the richter now 
Spit it from the heart drop it in proper style

Everybody on the floor 
If you workin' with somethin'
Vibe go right through ya 
Ooh what that groove do to ya
Sound so sick through the stereo 
Flamin' out the box scaldin' hot
Ice water couldn't stop hits burnin' ya block
Edgy pop lil' rock wit that real hip hop
'Til ya body drop gotta pause to breathe 
Got those that didn't believe rockin' wit me now
 
I know you can't handle me 
I know ya'll ain't ready for me
This chick here ya'll bout to see 
Goin' change the situation

Beats steady bumpin' I just broke em' off somethin'
See em' frontin' wit a whole lotta nothin'

See I ain't pressed for the spot light 
Camera keep flashin' while I'm stuck at the stop light
Yo what the hell just happened 
All ya'll followin' me just for rappin'

Haters goin' envy that don't offend me
Wit' ya little attitude please don't tempt me

Bunch of guys goin' off like lil' girls 
On the side showin' off like
ATL in the house be the teens wearin' jeans 
Rockin' gold in they mouth
Kingston upstate New York 
Lil' place up North where the style is raw
Hit me up 2-way or the celli

Comin' to a party near you 
No matter where I go its about what I do

[Verse One]
It all started like this; 9th grade, freshman year
So happy to be in high school I shedded a tear
So many cute dudes to choose from, I knew it was one
that was, right for me, well I thought at least
He was the big guy on campus on the football team
Basketball; homecoming, he was voted for King
There was me, I was on the cheerleading squad
Sweet sixteen, lookin for love in my heart
It was a, beautiful thing from the start I must say
Only problem, my parents were strict, they ain't play
No phone calls after 8, no stayin out late
I'm like daaaaamn, gimme a break
Hormones kickin in, start displayin my shape
More concerned with my looks than my books and grades
Headed nowhere fast, I was on my way
Curiosity, c'mon, I know y'all relate

[Chorus]
Think about the characters in my storybook
The pages I have read you
This ain't your momma's fairytale
The things that I have been through
In all my life, and all my days
I ne-ver thought I would end up this way

[Verse Two]
It's been a year now I'm a sophomore, maturin no more
Still I'm young and dumb and plus I'm unsure
who I am what the future has in store
Man I'm tryin to be grown cause my parents now divorced
I took a charge to roll with Dough Boy
Moms tried to force me to move to New York
But of course, that plan it fell short
She found herself caught up in court on child support
Drama, problems of all sorts
Stressin started smokin Newports
Carefree, about the ones who care for me
Lost teen, givin up on my dreams, and as worst as that seems
had me thinkin crazy things like suicide
Like it'd better everything if, I just die
Full blown, without guidance or a home
I'm startin to get stomach pains, that's strange, what could be wrong?

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
What do I do, I ask myself, everyday
A child givin birth to a child, what can I say?
This wasn't 'posed to happen to me, no way
Hear I am, turned my back on my fam, well GOD DAMN
Wasn't even part of the plan, I'm spazzin out
I lay down at night, the hurt just burst out
I shout - how could he leave at my time of need?
'Specially now I'm pregnant and due in three?
Maybe, I should have it and give it up for adoption
I can't graduate, I ain't been to school since August
Often I hear this voice talkin in the back of my mind
So many problems in my life
I just pray for my time to come
God take me leave my child behind, I'm on the run
Adrenaline pumpin so angry, I could kill some'n
Don't make me prove it cause if you don't do it then I'ma do it
I'm foolish and so STUPID!

[Chorus] - repeat 2X to fade",It's Not a Fairytale
Sarai,"It's been along time comin locked in the lab wit a infa-red pen and a pad
 A lot of chicks in tha game sound da same can't switch they style an they making me laugh
 They tickle me like (ha,ha,ha) it ain't that hard spit raw 16 bars
 don't make me have to pull your card rip it apart get'em shocked like they all seen god
 I got'em stuck amazed lost in a daze cause the pen don't stop for days
 4 weeks 4 years I keep it movin driven by fears never losin
 Playin 2 win the game I'm in making they head spin
 Industry was needin me like emphysema patients need oxygen
 Cop whips off the the lots again rockin all spots I'm in 
 North, South, East, West overseas and back again
 DJ's fiend for the wax 2 spin some of ya'll gon need some practicin 
 Got everybody in the world sayin damn that's Sarai on the track again
 
 This is how it's gon be I've been workin hard 
 For this puttin in all I got I'm a be a star for this
 Yo pardon Miss. excuse me but you got to make way
 I ain't new to this stay true to this been doin this since back in the day
 I been puttin in work writing so much that my whole head start to hurt 
 Up so late fall asleep hands on my face so tell me what its worth 
 (It's Official) I stepped on you fell off and the don't miss you 
 Bomb shit like missiles while you rip easy like wet tissues
 Issues you got to deal wit phenomenal styles is how I sealed it
 Hot flows hot beats I know you got to feel it
 I keeps it real wit everything I do don't have to pull tha front for you 
 No they can't believe they ears how she spit the way she do
 It's official
 
 You know how much time I spent at home 
 writing rhymes fiending for a microphone
 Like Eric be	 & Rakim I had dreams to move the crowd 
 get everybody rockin one shot wit tha infa-red dot hit you right in tha pocket
 Haters will try & block it but there's just no way to stop it
 Go slow fast fiction or fact go ahead pick your topic 
 when the fire ignites I hop on the flight headed to tha top just like rockets
 I'm dedicated finally made it y'all don't know how long I've been waited
 Mrs. Strawberry blonde wanted it bad so you know I'm about to get it on
 (get it on)
 
 It's been so long I've waited
 And I can't believe that I
 Finally made it 
 It was all a dream till I
 Dedicated
 My life to tha game so you can 
 Feel me baby",It's Official
Sarai,"Once again standin' here cryin out
 Energy gone my insides dyin' out
 Wishin' you was dead or somewhere lyin' out
 Every time you open ya mouth lies flyin' out
 Remember when we first met you wit' ya crew
 Me wit' my girls doin' what we usually do
 You wit' ya game comin' at me askin' my name
 Knew it was love first sight you said it the same 
 Talked on the phone the whole night vibe feelin' so right
 Every step pointin' to love the future so bright 
 Till this girl in my class told me she was pregnant 
 And that you was the dad
 How she wasn't jealous of me or nothin' I had 
 How you cheated on her several times and treated her bad
 And as she was tellin' me that my whole world collapsed
 Feelin' like a fool still in love wit' you
 
 [Chorus (2x):]
 Mommy always told me 'bout life Life never plays to be nice
 Tragedy's all in my life
 Love is what destroyed my life, life
 
 What tricks you gon' play now 
 Nothin' you could say 'cause everything is clear now 
 I can see where I made my mistakes 
 Stayin' home a good girlfriend gimmie a break 
 I'd be home alone callin' you catchin' the shakes
 Every minute till you call back adrealine raced
 Left me hangin' on my birthday when I stayed at ya place 
 You came home the next morning
 I just stared in ya face
 Knew where you was actin' dumb it tore me apart
 Took it out on your things put the key to your car
 Felt like you had a knife all this pain in my heart
 Deep down though still wishin' we could restart
 For a second I was on top swore I had the cream
 Rude awakeing nothin' come to sleepers but a dream 
 It's sinkin' in never really loved me and it seemed 
 What was I thinking I was only in my teens
 
 [Chorus (2x):]
 Mommy always told me 'bout life Life never plays to be nice
 Tragedy's all in my life
 Love is what destroyed my life, life
 
 Nowadays when I see you I don't feel bad
 Got a real love in my life you be a real dad
 For once in ya life try doin' somethin' right
 By now you should be ready to slow it down
 'cause you know what go 'round come back 'round
 Even though it hurt to let you go I had to roll
 A demon in disguise you was tryna take my soul
 Couldn't make a move you was tryna take control
 In a way I could only balme myself naive
 I made the choice to be wit' you and no one else indeed
 A picture in a broken frame upon the shelf indeed
 Had to take a lil' time to know myself 
 Every now and then and then I start to reminisce wantin' ya kiss
 Even though I know it's dangerous 
 Every now and then I start to reminisce 
 For real even though I know it's so dangerous
 
 [Chorus (4x):]
 Mommy always told me 'bout life Life never plays to be nice
 Tragedy's all in my life
 Love is what destroyed my life, life
 
 [Jaguar:]
 What a chick gotta do to get some love?
 What I gotta do to say enough is enough?
 
 What's the point of bein' wit somebody, that only bring ya down
 Goin 'round and 'round
 
 [Chorus (till end):]
 Mommy always told me 'bout life Life never plays to be nice
 Tragedy's all in my life
 Love is what destroyed my life, life",L.I.F.E.

[Verse One]
Hey Mr. DJ, turn the music up loud
And everybody report to the dancefloor now
Line 'em up cause we bouts to get down
Off the chain like they do it in the South
Everybody just havin a good time
Got my eyes on the guys that's here, they so fine
That's right, Sarai can get it krunk
How much junk you got in that trunk?
Come out the house, get on the street
Hear Cee-Lo, let out the 'Closet Freak'
Act a fool, you can do what you want
Get loose cause the track be that funk
Groove to the bump

[Interlude]
Just break it down
Make the truck wobble with an extra bounce
Make it touch the ground and then RAISE IT UP
Like the garbage men do it with the dump truck

[Chorus]
Ladies, hands up
Let me see you shake your stuff
A-be	-see and D cups
Little bitty to big ol' butts
Fellas, hands high
Let me see you work it out one time
Put your body a-gainst mine
Come on baby, griiiiiiind

[Verse Two]
Uh-oh, here we go!
Time to shake that ass on the danceflo'
Jiggle that thing like Jell-O
All my rich chicks, and the girls in the ghetto
Throw it up, get krunk
Ball, 'til you fall, that's right
In the club or either bump in your ride
Slim or big-boned, don't matter yo' size
Don't matter if you black or white
All shapes and sizes spread love worldwide
How many of y'all the same color inside
So why divide?  I mean there's no reason why
East coast, to the Westside
Midwest to the South we tiiight
That's fo'sho yo please believe
I'ma stay bein me ain't no changin me
Like, Trick see, ""I luh da kids""
So I gotta look out for as long as I live

But for now

Tube, tops, T, shirts
Blue, jeans, mini, skirts
Overtime, make it work
Wobble that ass 'til the thing hurt
Wife, beaters, throw, backs
Fitted caps, bucket hats
No matter where you from, where you at
Shake that shit like how you love dat
E-e-everybody get your boogie on
Party all night to the break of dawn, c'mon
Put your hands in the air
And wave 'em all around like ya just don't care yea
Front to the back over there
V.I.P. area, ballers upstairs
Get buck, stand on top of chairs
To the top of the lungs and let me hear OH YEAHH

Sarai,"Bring it on back to the young days when things wasn't so hard
 Playin kickball in the school yard
 The year before kindergarten when memories started at the day care
 All the Little kids used to play there
 We had no worries just hated nap time but fingerpaintin' and playin' tag was fine
 And we would all run around except for this girl
 She stayed in the corner, Yeah her name was Mary Anne
 She missed half of the school days scince the year began
 Never wore a shirt that showed more than her hands
 She rockin' jeans & Long sleeves in like 90 degrees
 You know lil' kids they treat her like she got a disease
 Came in 1 day all her hair was gone
 Said her mamma cut it off cause she did something wrong
 Tears in her eyes when she finally said somethin 
 Usually she would get scared and wouldn't say nothin
 
 Days that went by, she had to cry, wonder why did it happen to me
 Day after day, she slipped away, wonder why did it happen to me
 
 Elementary she got the seat next to me
 Lucky i wasn't mean like the rest could be
 She treated like an outcast wonder how long she could outlast
 Bein alienated by the whole class
 It was still touch and go with the whole school scenario
 In for days out for weeks still scared to speak
 I wonder if that one time she had tried to tell and the teacher shrugged her off like Oh Well
 I wonder if that shut her down
 Maybe she had no one to turn to
 Maybe this little girl didn't know what to do
 We had a project one week me and Mary Anne a team
 So i invited her to my house for ice cream
 She bangin on the door at the house invite her to sit on the couch 
 She looked me in the eyes
 Mary Anne began to cry
 I said what's wrong she said she wanted someone to tell her why
 
 Days that went by, she had to cry,
 wonder why did it happen to me
 Day after day she slipped away, wonder why did it happen to me
 
 After that incident she didn't really  want to talk to me
 I'd see her in the hall 
 Call out but she wouldn't walk with me
 Junior high she got cover up caked up
 You could see the bruises underneath the make - up
 Stories to make up people askin question now
 She breakin down but still no confessions now
 She walk around dazed out lost in another land spaced out
 And as days go by she grows more distant
 Teachers barely aware of her existence
 She in and out more out than in
 And one day i'm in class
 The ambulance pass screechin
 Down by the artroom off to the right in the bathroom
 They found Mary Anne on the floor
 A bottle next to her 
 Said she took like 50 pills or more
 And left a note that said she couldnt handle it no more
 
 Days that went by, she had to cry,
 wonder why did it happen to me
 Day after day she slipped away, wonder why did it happen to me",Mary Anne

Worst then the media with followin' shit

Always startin' arguments over wrong information
So ridiculous stupid idiots

You targeted haters
Instigators put your life in the paper
The media can either make you or break you
Make a chick sick want to drink with no chaser
Get away vacate to some place in Jamaica
So I can puff all the ganja I want to
And don't have to worry
Bout them runnin' up on you
 
I don't get it with these nosy folks
All up in yours they be killin' me you

Or maybe so before you were even known
Two-wayin' me calling even come to my home
Man I wish they would leave me alone
Dear god could you help me here
And close all these nosy peoples ears
It's not the fans who I'm talking to
It's those irritating nosy mothahushup's

Who you know places you go

Gotta gossip like beauty parlors
Blabbin' your trap girl let me tell you
You know things like that
I know you heard the word
See rumors spread like that
Dippin' in the koolaid don't know the flava
Gambling ideas they more lost then Vegas
They got it major even god can't save them
You can bathe them in holy water
It still ain't no cure for them
But in a way I kinda feel for them
'Cause that's the only thing they know
So they mouth keep going going

 How many dimes you done dropped the same lines to
 Played games and lied to got inside ooh
 Don't even want to think about it
 Somebody tried to tell me all them games you played around wit'

 Did you ever really keep it real when it counted
 I release myself and roll out
 Said ya'd never lie but ya sold out
 Before ya know it I'm gone
 With short notice 'cause I played them games way too long
 I'm movin on movin up movin out
 Sit and think about why you losin out

 Tag team hittin girls from rag team
 The rat heads boost ya ego to a fat head
 Comin wit' lies I don't deserve saw you as the center of my earth

 What's it worth for me to stick around and see you lie
 Right to my face and it's supposed to be alright
 Well it's not and I've had enough
 Hit the whammy dog should've stopped pressin your luck

Forget what mama told me as a little girl
Bout to get grown, get on, and rock yo' world
Your body tellin my body how your song goes
While you smackin my bum-bum like your bongos
Ride it like Tonto, I'll be your sidekick
The sweetest sang when the mouth silent
When you doin what you doin get to movin the tongue, tornado
""OH I AIN'T IN KANSAS NO MORE!""
I ain't no hoe, no whore, I deserve a reward
Waterbed make waves like the seashore
I see more in you, than the average Joe
So you don't see the trash where the average go
It ain't standard, to have a dude in my clutch
Sometimes I buck, HOLD ON, the ride gets rough
I feel I must, touch the A+
Double barrel gun baby, we both bust

[Chorus]
You make me feel like DANCIN
When you get to ROMANCIN me
Make me want to SING so SWEET
Body to body I feel ya heat
Ya make me want to FREAK OUT
Ain't no way I'm goin home, lonely
Make me feel like SWEATIN, FORGETTIN
E-everything my mama told me

You and the liquor got my eyes blurrin
And when you licka the kitten for certain, she get to purrin
Ridin the wave you got me surfin, eatin what I'm servin
I'll play the game, show me what's behind the curtain
All the slurrin got me urgin, to get the work in
Bodies mergin, hot like chicken jerkin
X-Rated version, me and this person
Gettin down in the dirt and grabbin his shirt and his jeans
Perkin, have him hittin high notes like MC, in +Fantasy+
Could it be you and me on the +Island+ whylin
You down low like you deep-sea divin
Worlds collidin, emotions explodin
Juices flowin, the climax approachin
Face soakin that number nine potion
You need some winnin plays, get me to coachin

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I think I might, try-why to get this fly guy
in my, ri-ide, hop in the 7-4-5-i-i
Take you places you ain't never seen
Can you keep your cool if I whip until you cream
Don't mean to be obscene, put the children to bed
Thugs like N.O.R.E., in the whip gettin ""he'd""
What I said like Keyshaun, I'm the receiver
Gwan' try me, testify, you a believer
You never up and leave her
Stay on call, Dr. Dutch, master of it all
Move slow like the Southern drawl
And make it quick like the N.Y.C. cats spit
OH SHIT!

[Chorus] - repeat 2X to fade",What Mama Told Me
Sarai,"[Verse One]
I don't bust guns, I bust rhymes to see funds
Four-four caliber tongue, you want some?
Let me know, K.O. flows, ya gots none
Let me know, that you don't speak 'til I'm done
And ya know, double-S straight to ya chest
Storch and Sarai, now who the best?
He's all I work with y'all, nuttin less
Infra-Red's the click I rep to the death
Hold tight, see light ya just might
Back hand like Van Damme all on the mic stand
.. go off like Lara Croft
Fire hair, hard body, killin you so soft
Like it better when they turn the lights off
Get gone, get in the zone, let's get it on
It's a shame, you was smilin when you came
Cryin when you left, what, thought it was a game?
c'mon

[Chorus]
No matter what they say, I'm just gon' do my thing
Straight up hurt this game, y'all know you could never hold me
Though they hate a lot, I still come out on top
Try to take my spot, y'all know you could never hold me

[Verse Two]
I got, nuttin but hits that's hot
Came in at the top from the first single dropped
I'm everything that yo' not, takin yo' spot
I Sarai be the sho' shot
Soon as I stepped on stage I blow spots
Got Liberace feelin my ghost, I glow rocks
Sparklin baby, like Perrier pop
Got demos at the crib that ain't never been copped
Better, when they put me under pressure
The secret weapon, I'm the hidden treasure
Diamond in the rough, carats beyond measure
Bars I drop for y'all, my pleasure
Hoodie or the high heels, whatever is whatever
Videos with the ass hangin out, never
Can't see a dime from here, yo listen
Get a prescription, holla at Pearle Vision

[Chorus] - repeat 3X",You Could Never
Sarantos,"The moment of truth is upon us
Are you ready for the climb that lies ahead?
Does the passion burn in your heart?
Is your mind starting to understand?

This challenge that's thrown upon us
We need to struggle to learn to survive
Only once in a lifetime you feel it
This must be our time to thrive

Do you know how long you can take it?
Are you willing to take the chance?
Do you know if you really believe it?
Are you sure you can last?

As the night settles down upon us
The moon shining bright tonight
You look up to heaven for guidance
And ask yourself if the timing's right

Can you believe for one second that you've made it?
Are you sure you can play their game?
You answer your critics with a question
You're not sure you'll ever be the same

Do you know how long you can take it?
Are you willing to take the chance?
Do you know if you really believe it?
Are you sure you can last?

Do you know how long you can take it?
Are you willing to take the chance?
Do you know if you really believe it?
Are you sure you can last?

Listen to that beating drum?

Do you know why your heart makes that sound?
Is there a doubt still in your mind?

Are you ready to take the crown?
Are you ready to take the crown?
Are you ready to take the crown?

Do you know how long you can take it?
Are you willing to take the chance?
Do you know if you really believe it?
Are you sure you can last??

Are you ready for all the glory?
Are you willing to risk it all?
Are you sure you can take it?
Do you wanna make it?

Do you really want it all?

Sarantos,"Lately I hear the melodies of sorrow
As the story unfolds, as the darkness draws near
My heart starts feeling so hollow
And it cries out in fear

The night surrounds me, its emptiness divides me
As I look for the answers, I try hard to find the questions
But my heart won't let me think
As the pain makes me weep

Back and forth
Back and forth I go, never right or wrong
My mood changes so quickly
As my heart beats endlessly

Back and forth
Back and forth I go, never wrong or right
My mind changes so quickly
& my mood swings carelessly

It never felt this good, it never felt this right
As the story goes on, so does the fight
Looking back on this day, the battle was won
Nothing left to say, I can't help but feel this way

Back and forth
Back and forth I go, never right or wrong
My mood changes so quickly
As my heart beats endlessly

Sarantos,"Been a real long day baby, and I really missed you
Feel real good when I come home, I really do
Work was long and just so hard
What got me through the day, 
Was remembering our first kiss in the schoolyard

I'm not myself when you're away
I sit around and wait for you to come home all day
I think of you, I feel you holding me
Can't wait for you 
To walk through the door so I can kiss your body

This is a country song I wrote for you
'Bout a man and his wife and what they liked to do
When you're by my side, I got nothing I need to hide
I get you 'n you get me, 
It's so simple and just so easy

I wrote this song for you

I'm not gonna let you down darling, 
Just you wait 'n see
For a lifetime I promise, you can depend on me
Life's about lovin' you 
You're the best I ever had
I thank the Lord, 
'Cause he took away the bad

Sitting by the fire getting cozy my sweet
I'm so grateful for what you've given me
A little house on the edge of town
And a white fence going all the way around

This is a country song I wrote for you
'Bout a man and his wife and what they liked to do
When you're by my side, I got nothing I need to hide
I get you 'n you get me

You always make me feel like such a helpless fool 
Don't you know your heart will always tell on you 
You just can't hide not even deep inside 
The fact I'm yours and you are mine 

You are mine (Together)
You are mine (Together)",A Country Song

I stood on top of the world

Wonder if I made a mistake, from the very start
It seemed so right, way back when
Didn't realize I did, everything she said

What kind of life, am I choosing to live?
What kind of lover, doesn't like to give?
How can I change her back, into what she used to be?
It's what I want, I want nothing to hide

At what point, did I, simply lose control
Woke up each morning, losing my soul?
When you stop believing, it's never something good
When you start to wonder, that's when you should

What kind of life, am I choosing to live?
What kind of lover, doesn't like to give?
When did I make, such a big mistake?
It's what I want, I want nothing to hide??

Staring at the wall, nothing left to feel
I will take it like a man, to run, to run and hide

It's a sunny day

I swear, it was made for me

Yes, just for me!

Sarantos,"Sometimes questions, they flood my mind
At times like this, I just ask

Why
Why

Can you tell me why
Why I fell for you
Why do I ask why?
Why do I look up to the sky
And still think about why

'Cause

My heart bled for you
As you walked in the room
My soul fell for you
Suddenly I knew what not to do

Each breath I take I take for you
Each beat my heart makes it makes for you
Oh please tell me what to do
I can't think right since I fell for you

You cast a spell on me
My body quickly agreed
Your eyes so gentle as they held onto me
I couldn't help but just believe

My heart was meant for you, you and only you

My heart races for you
My heart cries to you
My heart begs for you
My heart flies to you
My heart bleeds for you??

Why does my heart feel this way
Why do I feel this way?
No logical reason that I know of
But I still wanna stay

Stay with you, stand next to you, 
Even when you're blue girl
I wanna hold you, 
Put you in my arms and shelter you
You know I'd die for you, I'd lie for you
I'd do anything for you

Now you know why

Why
Why

Before I met you
I couldn't tell anyone why
They would tell me something
I would mutter back nothing
Life was such a rough thing

Life was so hard
Never talked about it out loud
Kept my feelings to myself
Kept them inside and felt so proud!

Felt like such a man
Told myself that's what I am
But I felt so weak, strong on the outside
But frail on the inside

But then I fell for you
I had nothing to prove
But my heart was so moved
Knew from the moment??

I first stared at you

My heart races for you
My heart cries to you
My heart begs for you
My heart flies to you
My heart bleeds for you??

Why does my heart feel this way
Why do I feel this way?
No logical reason that I know of
But I still wanna stay

Stay with you, stand next to you, 
Even when you're blue girl
I wanna hold you, 
Put you in my arms and shelter you
You know I'd die for you, I'd lie for you
I'd do anything for you

Don't ever leave me alone, 
I don't wanna feel alone
I also don't wanna feel the fear, 
Of being left behind

No one there to see
No one there but me
Please keep that heartache away from me
I'm so scared to feel that pain

If I lose you, 
I'd lose the only love I ever truly had
And that would make my heart hurt so bad
And I would feel so mad
And so so sad, so sad

Because my heart wants to do
Everything for you
It wants to prove
My love for you

Le cortÃ³ con su espada en dos.
La obsesiÃ³n por una traiciÃ³n.
La ansiedad que le quiere ahogar.
Siempre fue mercenario cruel,
Que sirviÃ³ al mejor postor.
Sin Ley
Para otros robar
Quemar
La tierra de otros
Luchar
Por otros sangrar
Sin Dios
Matar a morir
No hubo rey a quien respetar.
Ni mujer a quien no violar.
DecidiÃ³ no tener piedad.
DestacÃ³ entre los demÃ¡s.

",Mercenario
Saratoga,"Recorrió largo tiempo en su reloj 
Peleo para ser lo que es hoy 
Luchador, testarudo y como no 
Cariñoso y tierno como yo 

Sin pensar me enseñaba a reaccionar 
Al calor de su lumbre y su voz 
Un bastón le ayudaba a caminar 
Pero él era duro como yo 

Y el camino acabó 
Su mirada dulce y gris voló 
Y su luz se apagó como la llama 
Del candil que hace tanto tiempo ardió 
Y su voz susurraba y susurraba 
Liberarme de todo el dolor 

Una vez de pequeño me cantó 
La canción que de niño aprendió 
Carcajadas comenzaron a sonar 
Porque él era alegre como yo 

Él nos dijo adiós 
Va a reunirse pronto con su dios 
Y su luz se apagó como la llama 
Del candil que hace tanto tiempo ardió 
Y su voz susurraba y susurraba 
Liberarme de todo el dolor 

Él nos dijo adiós 
Va a reunirse pronto con su dios 
Y su luz se apagó como la llama

Sobre la cima la debe encontrar. 

Podrá volar, ser un halcón
Capaz de ver la paz de su interior. 
Se fue, no dijo adiós.
Alzó sus brazos, no la pudo seguir. 

Condenado a vivir,
Sin llorarla y sin sentir. 
En su trampa caerás, 
Si la quieres es para ti. 

Como amiga llegará. 
Como extraña se te irá, engañándote. 
Robará tu corazón 
Si la intentas atrapar.

Sentir que la magia me está hechizando

Puede que busque un sueño imposible
Pero lo quiero intentar
Fundo la pasión con la obsesión
Casi no puedo pensar

Ahora o nunca. Lo puedo lograr
Aunque la paciencia pueda traicionarme
Estoy muy cerca, lo empiezo a notar
No voy a dejar que se escape ahora

No me esconderé
Ni fracasaré
Mis metas alcanzaré

Ya ruge el motor
El tiempo paró
La cuenta atrás comenzó

Llevo un pura sangre metido en mi piel
Ya no lo puedo parar
Tengo que sacar mi instinto animal
Ya sólo quiero correr

Corren al amanecer, traicionando la verdad,

Burning your mind you hear the bell
The gates are open for your entry
Light of day turn to the darkness of hell...

Skull and putrid corpses
Sads and somber places
And you cry tears of blood

Now I will go prowl on endless night
Remembering yours blasphemes and lies
I will never give mercy to you
But satanas want your sinner's soul
You will never return

Sardou,"En ce temps-là,
Monsieur le surveillant des classes secondaires
Etait un peu efféminé.
En ce temps-là,
Je lisais ""Le Grand Meaulnes""
Et après les lumières,
Je me faisais plaisir,
Je me faisais dormir.
Je m'inventais un monde
Rempli de femmes aux cheveux roux.
J'ai dit de femmes, pas de jeunes filles.

Cette année-là,
Je n'oublierai jamais le regard de vipère
Que m'avait lancé ce vieux rat.
Cette année-là,
J'avais posé les yeux sur la croupe incendiaire
De ma professeur de droit.
Elle avait mis le feu en moi.
J'avais avalé la lumière.
J'aurais aimé la terre entière.
Seulement les femmes, pas les jeunes filles.

Pauvre de moi,
Monsieur le surveillant des classes secondaires
Passait ses nuits à espionner.
Pauvre de moi,
Du couloir des secondes au dortoir des premières
Comment les jeunes étaient couchés.
Bien sur le dos, les bras croisés
Sur la couverture de laine,
Des fois qu'on aurait des idées,
Pauvre taré, pauvre chimère.

C'est pourtant là
Que durant des années j'ai rêvé d'adultère
Que je n'ai jamais consommé
Et chaque nuit quand je tiens dans mes bras
Une femme trop fière
Qui se refuse à me donner
Un peu plus que le nécessaire
Parce que j'hésite à la défaire
De son carcan de préjugés,
Parce que je n'ai pas la manière
J'ai presque envie de lui confier

Would anybody put chains on me?
I've paid my dues to make it
Everbody wants me to be
What they want me to be
I'm not happy when I try to fake it!
No!
Ooh,that's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
I want to be high, so high
I want to be free to know
The things I do are right
I want to be free
Just me, babe!
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
Because I'm easy

Because I'm easy

Get down, I wanna get up (3x)
Together we go crazy
Monday and I'm still not recovered

And Wednesday and I'M waitin' for Thursday

I'm missing someone to stand by my side

I feel lonely, lololololonely
You're the one and only
That makes me feel so blue
I feel lonely, lololololonely
You're the one and only
That makes my dreams come true

It's not easy to fall in love
So I pray to god above

Alloy caps, front grills, automatic,

Stereo, fog lights, accelerate,
Motorway, cruise control, low suspension,
Hypertension,
Pumping up inside of me

With no speed-limit
Wanna drive it fast
Foot down on the gas
And the wheels turn round and round

Foot down on the floor
Roof back,
Slam the doors,
Get inside, we can ride,
Take the wheel for a while

Ain't it strange how we keep missing each other
Connecting not enough, we let it be
So wide awake but no eyes for one another
There must be a bridge that brings you nearer to me

Although you laugh
I know it brings you down
I tried to cover up
But I'm not that clever

Believing in yourself (and this is what you say)..

Everytime, everytime I think I know what life´s romance is
It´s only then I find,
Still don´t know the questions let alone the answers.
Am I here just for myself? do I live for someone else?
Will I find just what i´m missing?
I´ll) remember who I am, always try again and keep
Believing in myself (and this is what i´ll say)..

Sasha,"It's really amazing â?? my live is complete
I've got all I wanted â?? more than I need
Those were the words â?? I heard myself say
But I'm not so sure anymore

I think I was about â?? closing the file
By the time that you shot me â?? whit your disarming smile
I don't know what you see â?? but I can't guarantee
That there's something in me to adore

but it seems you don't care at all
You're never afraid of the fall
Reveal me your secret â?? I promise to keep it
But I just can't stop to wonder

how do you know
If this is alright
How do you know
If all that you give â?? comes back to you
How can you be so damn sure
That this way is the right one to go
How do you know

it's so amazing â?? how far you can get
Just by keeping your mind â?? away from regrets
Following targets â?? without looking back
I've missing the view that's around

you pull me to places â?? I almost forgot
Maybe I'm worth it â?? maybe I'm not
I'm more than a sinner â?? and less than a saint
But it seems that you don't care at all

how do you know
If this is alright
How do you know
If all that you give â?? comes back to you
How can you be so damn sure
That this way is the right one to go
How do you know

so whatever may hide in the dust
In you and your senses I trust
I can't see the future â?? but sometimes I feel
Like you can do.

how do you know
If this is alright
How do you know
If all that you give â?? comes back to you
How can you be so damn sure
That this way is the right one to go
How do you know



",How Do You Know
Sasha,"When I wake up and the sun won't shine 
And I see the bedlam all around me 
I turn over and get back to sleep again 

If I could skip or erase this day 
But it's much too young to feel sorry 
So I'm trying to get on my feet 
Again and again and again and again 

Now and then I start talking to myself 
Cause I'm ashamed did tell anybody else 
Do I really need to ask for someone's help 
To find out 

That I'm alive 
And I can't get myself outta here 
I'm alive 
I'm alive 

Man in the mirror why you're staring at me 
You have to see the same face tomorrow 
Do me a favour and get out of my way 
For today, just today 

It's not the answer but the question that makes life 
A little bearable like dating you ex-wife 
Do I really need to back out and to hide 
I decide 

That I'm alive 
And I can't get myself outta here 
I'm alive 
And I do what I have to pull me through my life
I'm alive 
I'm alive 
I'm alive 

I tell you one thing, 
I do need something 
I pull of good luck charms to bathe in 

I tell you one thing,
I do need something 
I pull of good luck charms to bathe in 
And I hope I'm getting out alive 

When I wake up and the sun won't shine 
And I see the bedlam around me 
I turn over and get back to sleep again 
And again and again

Sasha,"I used to laugh, I used to cry
I used to do everything I wanted to
I don't know when, I don't know why
But somewhere I must have lost that guy I knew
With a drink or two
Any bad excuse would do

I would like to quit my job, take a trip around the world
I would like to live for love, but I'm scared of being hurt
I would do so many things if I just could break the ice
But I'm paralyzed

Where will I be in twenty years
If I cannot change, I just don't wanna know
The days go by, I don't know why
But it's kinda hard to rearrange your life
When your fear's your gloom
Any bad excuse will do

I would like to dive for pearls, but the water's way too deep
I would like to live my dream, but I cannot even sleep
I would like to taste the rain somewhere close to Paradise
But I'm paralyzed

I would like to play guitar, but it's always out of tune
I would like to write a song, but I cannot find a rhyme
I would do so many things; I just have to break the ice
But I'm paralyzed

I used to laugh, I used to cry
I don't know when, I don't know why

Sasha,"Met a girl and wrote a letter to get her
Asking her if she could fill a hole in my heart
Now I got myself all messed up just my luck
That she won't be buying and I should stop trying

Bought myself a brand new logo it's HUGO
But she don't notice me no matter how hard I try
Looked into a super hair do as you do
Kidding myself I'm a much cooler guy

And here she comes again
She's my one out of ten
I love her endlessly
But she don't me

Maybe she thinks I'm a loser to choose her
But I can't seem to get her out of my mind
Is it I'm dressed like a dummy, oh honey
I'm not that outdated just so underrated

Got a feeling like a phoney baloney
But I'd die for her if she would only be mine
Just one look this way would do me truly
You say hello before you say goodbye

And here she comes again
She's my one out of ten
I love her endlessly
But she don't me
",Here She Comes Again
Sasha,"All across the universe
Every boy and every girl
Is looking for this thing called love
So why do all the other guys
Got pretty women by their side
Some guys really can't complain

Every night I lay awake and cry
I'm missing someone to stand by my side

REFRAIN:
I feel lonely, lololololonely
You're the one and only
That makes me feel so blue
I feel lonely, lololololonely
You're the one and only
That makes my dreams come true
I feel lonely

It's not easy to fall in love
So I pray to god above
Lord I need a helping hand
Hey Mr. DJ play this song
I felt lonely for so long
This is my SOS for love

All the time I got it on my mind
Someone to hold me tight is hard to find

Embrace tight as a snake?s, a-slither
over the grave pit, hither, thither.

breaks dim, then will you find me gone;
and cold your bed, till comes the light.

with tenderness, all sweetness-rife:

et des caresses de serpent
autour d?une fosse rampant.

Like the blade of a knife 
So sharp so sweet

Locked away in the forest of the night

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

When will I die
When will I marry
Why do I cry for nothing sometimes
Why do I feel like I'm in a hurry
Feels like a race and I'm out of time
Like a lover turning into a friend
Somewhere a heart is getting broken again
How does the whole thing end?

I want to believe in something for real
I want to believe in something I feel
I want to believe it's all that I need
I want to believe

Who will be king and who will be beggar?
When will I have this mystery solved?
Who said a ring could mean love forever
Nothing's for sure except growing old
Will I always be here spinning my wheels
Or does misfortune have a hand in the deal
Is that how my fate is sealed?
I want to believe love has a chance to survive
The dream to be as one
I want to believe in a nurturing love
And not just a sacrifice

Where is my home and where am I going?
When will I know and how will I know?
I had a lover who turned into a friend
I had a heart but it got broken again
And I don't know if it ever will mend

I been sitting here all night
Tryin' to make this thing word out right
I been getting nowhere fast

I hear a little voice inside my head
It says if you want to do it girl - you got to have some faith
Come over here and listen - hurry up or you'll be late

The bloodsuckers you call friends
Drag you deep into the hole
Crazy - that you'd let them into your world
They will take your diamonds, baby they will steal your pearls
If you want to play the game
You got to lose the rules
You can play with passion
Rules are just for fools

You got to learn to fall in love with what's inside
Get on the horse I want to ride
I got a reason to believe the light's inside

Some things have to wait
Some things I will never get
I will always - I will always have my faith",Make You a Believer

So nobody can dig that thorn in my side

Time flies and I'm on the run
Time flies, I'm a loaded gun

And even if I'm fightin' at the starting gate
Can't hold me back, I'm gonna win the race
There'll me be no backin' down, from what I believe in
I've got the courage and I got the mouth
I ain't gonna spend my life without doubt

Who tell monkey the way?
Monkey will if monkey may

Come on

Who tell monkey the way?
Monkey will if monkey may

Well I don't mind if you don't keep
You're nose too clean

And I've seen my point of view
You're the ugliest thing I've ever seen
And I think I love you
