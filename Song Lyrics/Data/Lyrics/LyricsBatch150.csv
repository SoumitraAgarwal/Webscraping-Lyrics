Gottfried Boettger,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billy Joe
Gottfried Bottger,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues
Gotthard,"I need a woman, that holds on
That gives me time to think it over
Time for movin' on
That's all I want, right now, by me

I wanna meet a real heart, a true one
Too many words, too many lies
Bring confusion in my mind
I gotta break out
'cause I can't stand it anymore, no more

More that I want, more that I need
More that I want, more that I bleed
Can anybody find me an

Angel , angel, I'm crying out for you tonight
Oh angel, are you there or in my mind
I want you to believe me, please take me there

Sometimes I dream, and I wish to have
A little hand to carry me
Far away from what I see
If I only could have you, right now, by me

I wanna face a real world, a true one
Too many words, too many lies
Bring confusions in my mind
I gotta break out
'Cause I can't stand it anymore, no more

More that I want, more that I need
More that I want, more that I bleed
Can anybody find me an

You're so hard to find",Angel
Gotthard,"Well I'm driving down a highway
Like so many times before
While listening to the music, loud and proud
I'm movin' on

Every time it's the same
I hear you callin' my name, my name
I've been away for too long
Can't wait to see you again
Oh, you know I miss you

Downtown, downtown
It's always the same
Downtown, downtown

I hear the sound of every heartbeat
When the night is comin' down, down
I know exactly the place
Where all my friends are goin' to be
It's easy to see

Every time it's the same
I know, you're callin' my name, my name
I've been away for too long
Can't wait to see you again
Oh, you know I miss you

Downtown, downtown
It's always the same
Downtown, downtown, right!",Downtown
Gotthard,"Once again I start to wonder
Sailing thoughts on endless sea
Might be you I see reflected, from afar
Could be just my fantasy

All my love, and emotion
Life is nothing without you
Like a drop finds the ocean
I'm gonna find my way to you

Low thunder rollin'
Take me away, away
There's something callin'
Askin' me to play

Firedance, it's a firedance
Firedance, just a firedance, oh yeah

I'm the wind against the mountains
I'm the fire deep inside
I feel the magic, the rhythm is my soul
I no longer have to hide

Join me now, come on over
There's a place right here for you
Seize the moment and discover
All the things you always knew",Firedance
Gotthard,"Baby, is it right to fantasize
I said lady, I can't get this out of my mind
Yes I'm smoking I'm burning
I'm twisting I'm turning

Got to give a lot of love
Woman I'm learning
Baby, you let me run all night
And I can't stand it no more

I get down, I get down, on my knees
And you know, yes you know,
How it feels

I'm walking in the streets
And nobody cares for me
They keep on telling me
Nothing in this world's for free

My heart is on fire, right out of space
Such a killer body, with a little girl's face
Lady, is if right to fantasize..... oh yeah!

I get down, I get down, on my knees
And you know, yes you know,
How to tease, baby.....

Let's rock tonight

I get down, I get down, on my knees
And you know, yes you know
How to tease....",Get Down
Gotthard,"Trying to hide from every shadow
Scared from every noise that's comin' through
Got a 24 hour run
You know, I'm still around
Hunting you

Bad places, dark faces
Keep on runnin' for your life

'Cause I'm the hunter
I'm the hunter
I'm the hunter an eagle in the sky
I'm the hunter
I'm the hunter
I'm the hunter nowhere you can hide
Nowhere you can hide

Don't try to answer the phone
Beware of any stranger at your door
There's no way to imagine
Where it's coming from
Better hit the floor, yeah!",Hunter
Gotthard,"I got a certain little girl,
That's on my mind
No doubt about it,
She look so fine
She's the best girl that I've ever had
Sometimes for sure make me feel so bad

Na, na, na...... 

Hush, hush, I thought I heard callin'my name now
Hush, hush, she broke my heart
But I love her just the same now
Hush, hush, I thought I heard callin' my name now
Hush, hush, I need her love and I'm now not
To blame now

I've got her early in the morning
I've got her late in the evening
Oh, I wanna never need it now
Oh, gotta, gotta have it
Gotta have it now

She's got lovin' like quick sand
Only took one touch of her hand
Blow my mind and I meant so deep
I can't eat all
I can't sleep

Na, na, na......

Hush, hush, I thought I heard callin' my name now
Hush, hush, she broke my heart
But I lover her just the same now
Hush, hush, I thought I heard callin' my name now
Hush, hush, I need her love and I'm now not
To blame now",Hush
Gotthard,"He came walking through fire
I saw him walk on water too
A kind of living wire he's not like me and you, yeah, true

You can't demand reaction
He just holds the line
To get his satisfaction,
It's only a matter of time
A matter of time

No more, lonely figures in the night
Gotta find a way to break out free, yeah!
Why don't you

Take me, take me, take me to the wall of the big emotion
Take me, take me so I can see
The mirrors of destiny

He just gotta snap his fingers
And everything's just there around
Be careful, never hide
The sun before his eyes, before his eyes

No more lonely creatures in the night
Gotta find a way to break out free, yeah!
Why don't you",Take Me
Gotthard,"Here comes old flat top he come
Grooving up slowly he got
Joo joo eye ball he one
Holy roller he got
Hair down to his knees
Got to be a joker
He just do what he please

He wear no shoe shine he got
Toe jam football he got
Monkey finger he shoot
Coca cola he say
I know you, you know me
One thing I can tell you
Is you got to be free

Come together, right now
Over me

He bag production, he got
Walrus gumboat, he got
Ono sideboard, he one

Over me

He roller coaster, he got
Early warning, he got

Over me",Come Together
Gotthard,"Alright, now it's up to you
There's a rocking storm
Coming over you
Alright let's go

We've got the last call
And we're ready to go
Lights are burning
For another show tonight
It just feels alright

Shoulder to shoulder
Scream n' shout
We got what you need
A whole lotta dynamite
It just feels alright

It's now or it's never
Gonna make it last forever
It's really close to overload

We'll take you higher
More n' more
We'll take you higher
Than before

It's a journey to the eye of the storm
Hot vibrations coming one by one

We'll take you higher
Than ever before
Dig it",Higher
Gotthard,"Move on closer, near by my side
Let me take you for a while
Did what I had to, but it's still a long way
Hope you'll remember me
Each n' every day

Out on this long trail
Back on dusty roads, ridin' slow
Through the darkest of the nights, alone

I'm on my way,
I'm on my way,
I'm on my way, and I'll be there one day
Yeah, yeah

Another evening, I'm still in bed
Wheels are turning round n' round
Dancing with shadows,
Talking in the sleep
While the miles are passing away

Lights in the window
Lights in my head, riding slow
On the highway once again

I'm on my way,
I'm on my way,
I'm on my way, I got one place to stay

The place is getting empty
Roadies take the stage
The first to come, the last to go
Still wanna sing, still wanna play
Before I leave it all behind

Move on closer, near by my side
Let me take you for a while ....
Did what I had to, but it's still a long way
Hope you'll remember me
Each n' every day",I'm On My Way
Gotthard,"The road is long
With the many winding turns
That leads us to 
Who knows where?

But I'm strong.
Strong enough to carry him.
He ain't heavy, he's my brother.
So on we go.

His welfare is my concern.
No burden is his to bear.
We'll get there.
For I know

He would not encumber me.
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
If I'm laden at all,
I'm laden with the sadness

That everyone's heart isn't filled
With the gladness of love for one another.
It's a long, long road
From which there is no return.

While we're on our way to there,
Why not share?
And the load doesn't weigh me down at all.
He ain't heavy, he's my brother.","He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother"
Gotthard,"Don't know who's to blame
Don't know who was wrong
Love has died too soon
After all had just begun
Something in your eyes
Tells me you still care
Oh baby i swear

Deep inside my heart
Deep inside my soul
Something tells me no, I can't let you go
Saw it in your eyes
Last time when we met
I will never forget

How can you say
Our love is gonna last forever
How can you go
With this empty broken heart
Of mine

Let it be, let it be
Love's like a gun on me
Let it be, let it be
Like a bag of broken glass
I was killed in the name of love

You never see it coming
Doesn't tell you when it goes
Think it's getting near
Suddenly it's gone
Dirty little game
Don't even know your name
You just wouldn't say

Did you ever worried
Asking maybe please
Knew you couldn't take it
I would get on my knees
Searching for way out
But there ain't no doubt
It's like going blind

Get down on my knees for you

How can you say
You love me but it's better
This way
If you don't need it anymore
I'm drowning down like
Never before",Let It Be
Gotthard,"So you're telling me nowall your friends call you honey
There's your name on the wall
And it ain't that funny
Guess you're on the street
Shakin' legs every night
And the whole world's looking at you
Kinda love at first bite
And the same old song
I hear you play
On and on, again
You gotta make my day
Yeah, you drank all my wineN' you gave all my money away
No more gas in the carand your dog wants me to stay
Darling you know you go a little too far
But I'm sure not a pawn onyour chessboard
Baby, no more
Well; you take it all for granted
You got me hypnotised
So who do you think you are; honey
I want you to make my day
Don't need no pretty liesRead my lips

Gotthard,"I bought a ticket for the late night plane
I took my notebook, walked out in the rain
I said, I'm leaving, wanna know what makes
The world go round
A password leads me to my promised land
Hot information, in the palm of my hand.
I said I'm surfing ' honey
Sorry if I let you down
She said,
Hurry, you gonna get a heartache
I said, I'm comin, it's gonna be alright
I'm talking' ""windows, scanners and screens""
I'm getting' hot about those virtual dreams
I said I'm sorry honey
I just can't get out this time..no, no
And my little girl said...
Hurry...

There are so many ways to find happiness
There is so much to take, so much to give
So many trails and so many tricks

Someday you'll be down some you'll be up
But whatever you do whatever you say

There's only one thing that can show you the way
Love, a soul matter, our heaven on earth
Love, forever, wherever you go
You can live without clothes on top of a hill
Don't care about money and do what you will
Or live in a castle, diamonds and gold
You still won't be happy if you can't find love

We all have our dreams that we keep in our hearts
Some may come true and some may fall apart
Sunshine and rain, that's what it's all about
Live as you like but don't live without

Gotthard,"Heaven knows, I've been trough many ups n' downs
Live has been no friend of mine, I never got my crown
Suffocate my troubles in an empty glass of wine
To realize I was a fool, I thought she was all mine

Tried to make the best of it, a little day by day
Had all of the best cards, n' gave them all away
Took place in the front row of the rollercoaster ride.
Play it, do or die, God knows I tried

We believed it's gonna last forever
After all I know, this was just a lie
Out on my own, since you left me
Lord what a long, long time

Since you've been gone
Out on my own now, girl you hurt me
But it's all over now, the heartache is gone.
Now I know every story has a message I can use

Freedom's just another word for nothing left to loose
But we all run after something we will never find
A pair of blue eyes always makes us blind
We believed it's gonna last forever

After all I know, this was just a lie

will I fall again, will I stand the pain
When life takes me by surprise
will I just close my eyes
will I just let it be
When life takes all your dreams away
it's hard to find the way
the strength to carry on
but I feel these tears will make me strong
Everything is turning grey
Just waiting for tomorrow, hey
gotta find myself
gotta break this shell
Cause I won't let it get me down
Don't want to wear this ugly frown
I can start again
I believe I can
When life takes me by surprise

When love surrendered, I fell as deep as I could fall
And the fourth back to my music, to free this troubled mind

Why are we standing in the rain

And a good friend with no truth
What's a mother with no child

What is a priest who's telling lies
What's a guardian with no eyes
What is a man without a view

Janie's not alone
All she can do is run, that seems to be her destiny

No mother, no father, she calls for angels, but the angels cry
No chance, I guess that she was born to lose, yeah

And she never felt love from someone, never had love before
Can we ever stop the tears from falling, so she won't cry no more

Janie's not alone
She's not the only one, who lives a life in misery

I don't believe any word you say
There must be somebody else today

You must have taken me for a fool

Now another chance to say maybe
D'ya think I'm really that crazy

You better stick to your own kinds

And I believed that dream for too long 

All that you left was a letter 
I can't get it out of my mind 
No more laughter, no more sun 
Alone at the scene of the crime 

Now here I am, searching for forgiveness 
But nothing seems to matter anymore 

There's no tomorrow, only fire in the rain 
You say you're sorry 
But only memories remain 
You can't tell me there's a reason 
Why I should go trough all this pain 
And once again, once again 
I call your name 

Love was the wrong destination 
And I can't find healing touch 
But I won't forsake I won't give up 
Guess I still need you to much 

So here we are strangers to each other 
When once we held 
The whole world in our hands 

There's no tomorrow

You say in this life no one's wrong 
And nobody's right 
You say that you need to be free 
And that's what is killing me 

There's no tomorrow, only fire in the rain 
You say you're sorry 
But only memories remain

Cause still I belong to you 

Took a train to nowhere

IÂ´ll find someone to take me where youÂ´re completely out of view 
Lay it down, lay it down 
I try to be strong, but still I belong to you 

If we had the chance to take it 
Could we find the way to make things right 
Did I mean that much to you 
Gotta face the dream is over

When you know you love someone
While waitin' for the moment to come
Another day is gone

The stupid feels I keep inside
That only ever knows
They scare me everytime I have to
Face those simple words

And then goodbye's around the corner
And then goodbye should last one day
So I'm scared the time is runnin' out
And I see you walk away

There are goodbyes no one cares about
And others so hard to faith
So I'm trying to sing this song for you
For the words I need to say

I learned my lesson once
I thought I learn my lesson twice

When I can't make up my mind

And my life's just fallin' apart
Oh tell my lord why it takes so long
To let my heart speak out

And then goodbye's around the corner

I don't know
So wrong, I'm only wasting my time

It wasn't meant to be

It happened to me
But I can't live without you
Don't know if I want to
Always trying so hard to understand
Still I'm holding feelings
Still I can't believe it
You've always got the best of what I am
So why does it have to be me
I know, out there someone's waiting for my call

And I can't think of anything but you
And do you feel the same way too?

Outside the windows, leaves are brown
Like words of passion falling down, it's true
The one's I've never heard from you

Remember, love was such an easy game to play
Those days are flown a million miles away

Everything I want
Everything I do
Is trying to find myself again
'Cause life can be so cruel

For anything I've done
And things that I did wrong
I'm asking to forgive me 'cause it's obvious
I'm guilty of loving you

I'll take the chance, this is my life
I'm gonna make the best of what I am
I really need to understand

And should I fail or recognize
The mirror's not reflecting what I want to see
Someone else inside me

I'm stepping out the edge, I'm on the borderline
Ain't gonna make the same mistakes this time

'Cause everything I want
Everything I do
Is trying to find myself again
'Cause life can be so cruel

For anything I've done
And things that I did wrong
I'm asking to forgive me 'cause it's obvious
I'm guilty of loving you, guilty of loving you

Big lies, they always have been told
But right now you face another man
This time I turn the page around
No rhyme, no reason to be found
Why should I play the fool again

I keep on running in circles
In a crazy human race that never ends
I was never taking more than I needed
Always standing at the end of the line
Waiting for my turn to succeed it
But it's hard to keep playing the part
When there's nothing left at all

How come we always run for more
The rich is stealing from the poor
How come we're never satisfied
Don't know what I'm afraid to loose
Somehow I'm not allowed to choose
God knows I've never really tried

And Still we running in circles
In a crazy human race that never ends
I was never taking more than I needed

I can show you my charms
I can be Mr. nice or let you see
My dual personality
The one I ""Hyde"", I can show you my charms
But you know that we might have company
I think the name is lunacy
Really want to try
The other side of me

So tight, you know I'm stuck inside relations
Sometimes, I just don't know who I'll find

Or is there something that I shouldn’t know?

A thousand faces
My heart runs races
And I’m in need to really understand

There’s something about you, girl
That makes you mysterious
I’m out of my head so what am I to do?

I don’t want to believe that we’re giving up
On a world that’s growing cold

Where is love when it's gone with the wind
And a saint would turn to sin?
Where is love when a kid's gotta run
In a blaze from a gun?

Where is love when a man has to say
I see my whole life fade away?
Where is love when the hate is too strong?
Where is love when it's gone?

Is it beyond the sea?
Does it hide beneath the willow tree
Waiting for us to get back where we’re from?

Hope you will forgive us for what we’ve done
We don’t know where to begin
We’re too numb to take it in

Where is love when it's gone with the wind
And a saint would turn to sin?
Where is love when a kid's gotta run
In a blaze from a gun?

Where is love when a friend fades away
On the streets where we used to play?
Where is love when the hate is too strong?
Where is love when it's gone?

Gotye,"I'm living with your memory
In the attic in my mind
And you've been getting by without me
But I've been spending all my time
With a girl that I remember
Who'll never leave or need to grow
'cause when you left you left your memory
Now it's the only thing I know

When the past gives me no comfort
And though the future is the cost
The way I'm choosing to remember
I'll forever be the man I never was

And you, you fade
But the memory remains the same
And I, I can't change
And I think that living with your memory
Is slowly driving me insane

You are perfect but you're empty
And it gets so lonely in my mind
'cause your image in my memory's
The only shred of you that's left behind
You were real but then you left me
And that's the part I can't accept
So I'll keep on living with your memory
Because it's all that I've got left

Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?

Gotye,"Now your bowl is empty
And your feet are cold
And your body cannot stop rocking
I know
It hurts to let go

Since the day we found you
You have been our friend
And your voice still echoes in the hallways of this house
But now
It's the end

We will be with you
When you're leaving
We will be with you

Some feelings have a habit of persisting
Even though you wouldn't let it show

Gotye,"With our eyes wide open, we
With our eyes wide open, we

So this is the end of the story,
Everything we had, everything we did,
Is buried in dust,
And this dust is all that's left of us.
But only a few ever worried.

Well the signs were clear, they had no idea.
You just get used to living in fear,
Or give up when you can't even picture your future.

We walk the plank with our eyes wide open.

We walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we
(Walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we)
Yeah, we walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we
(Walk the plank with our eyes wide open.)

Some people offered up answers.
We made out like we heard, they were only words.
They didn't add up to a change in the way we were living,
And the saddest thing is all of it could have been avoided.

But it was like to stop consuming is to stop being human,
You'll want to make a change if you won't.
We're all in the same boat, staying afloat for the moment.

We walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we
(Walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we)
Yeah we walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we
(Walk the plank with our eyes wide open.)
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open,
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open,

I didn't know what to do
I was just stumbling around, around
Thinking things could not improve
I couldn't look on the bright side
Of anything at all
That's when you gave me a call

Now I feel better, better, better than before
I feel better, better, better, now I'm not down any more

And there were times I was sure, so sure
I couldn't turn it around
I couldn't care any more
About the good things I found
That's when you gave me a reason
To make me smile again
I only have to see you and then

I feel better, better, better than before

I can't keep it in
I'm falling all over myself
And I could jump out of my skin
Wanna break the door down
Just to greet the day
'Cause there ain't nothing that's more certain
To keep my blues away

And I say
(La la, hey hey)
And I say
(La la, hey hey)

And it can settle the sadness
And the voices in my head
When I'm in the glow of the warmth you throw
I can put all that to bed

That is all I need
To put behind me all my worry
And life's complexities

It may be only a moment
But the world just falls away
And I forget myself
And everything else
That depressed me yesterday

And I can sing
(La la, hey hey)
Yeah I sing

Gotye,"In the mornings
I was anxious
It's better just to stay in bed
Didn't want to fail myself again

Running through all the options
And the endings
Were rolling out in front of me
But I couldn't choose a thread to begin

And I could not love
'Cause I could not love myself
Never good enough, no
That was all I'd tell myself
And I was not well
But I could not help myself
I was giving up on living

In the morning
You were leaving
Travelling south again
And you said you were not unprepared

And all the dead ends
And disappointments
Were fading from your memory
Ready for that lonely life to end

And you gave me love
When I could not love myself
And you made me turn
From the way I saw myself
And you're patient, love
And you help me help myself
And you save me
And you save me
Yeah you save me",Save Me

But it's too good to throw it all away
Anyone would do the same
You've got 'em going
And you're careful not to show it
Sometimes you even fool yourself a bit
It's like magic
But it's always been a smoke and mirrors game
Anyone would do the same

So now that you've arrived well you wonder
What is it that you've done to make the grade
And should you do the same?
(Is that too easy?)
Are you only trying to please them
(Will they see then?)
You're desperate to deliver
Anything that could give you
A sense of reassurance
When you look in the mirror

Gotye,"Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off

We threw out the television
I'm Model D 575
Has custom flute presets
And Harmony-Plus in addition

Now for an arm and a leg
We get three half-dozen beats to choose from
So now we can pretend
That there's an orchestra in the lounge room

I put the genie bass on
So my left hand can play the choir
With sixteen foot Diapason
And Lowrey's patented Orchestral Symphonizer

Banjo's great on repeat
The kids want to play but they'll have to be patient
The wife can't help tapping her feet

Now we don't want to go out
When we could spend the night at home with the cotillion
Invite the neighbors around
Start the boss a nova beat and limbo from the living to the kitchen

Enjoy the state of the art
The magic swing piano really is astounding
Now we can't tell them apart
But these amazing simulations end up sounding even better than the real thing

Got to move along

Left alone in this wilderness

Hey, you think everything's funny
But I won't crack, I won't crack a smile
Screamer, scream on, ain't nobody gonna hear you anyway
Nobody gonna hear you

Victim of loneliness, another bastard child

Gov't Mule,"On the banks of the deep end
Where your soul is your best friend
Searching for a reason
To go astray
Wild dreams turn to nightmares
Silver clouds turn to golden stairs
And everything that you used to know
Is slipping away

Here I've got my puzzle-piece
Only got it for a short term lease
No time for asking
No going back to get hurt
I take a little from the mixture
Try to fit it into the picture
Got a place where you're standing
Dig your shoes into the dirt

Trying hard to get back
Runnin' on the stones
Put you on my shoulders
We can be the only one
See the world's still spinning 'round
Gettin' dizzy when we look

There's a reason to be home
There's a feeling when you smile
But it feels like it might take over
This feeling deep inside
And there's a distance down the line
Far away from the station
We can leave it all behind
On a rolling creation

Sit away from the window
And lock the door
Can't you learn from the last time
And the time before
See the world's still spinning 'round
Gettin' dizzy when we look

Got to leave town
To see the yellow flowers bloom
Sun going down
It's gonna be rising soon

On the banks of the deep end
Twisted as a river bend
Searching for a reason to go astray

You couldn't hire twenty-five men
To do what the man could do
Just the sound of his walking
Could split the whole damn town in two
Into the night full of shadows
He still walks when the thunder rolls
This river ain't shallow
Reminds us that the bell still tolls

Bears in the kitchen
Tigers on TV
The singer's pretending
That this song's for me
See the world's still spinning 'round
Gettin' dizzy when we look

You took a wrong turn
Down by the waterline
I heard they had to drag you off the sand
Find a dune and the wind will miss you
Hold on to a piece of dry land
Got to hold on to a piece of dry land
Got to hold on to a piece of dry land

Blown in with the night
All this beauty captured in a frame
Visibly shaken but never stirred
Drives them insane
I see the way she plays her men, and I know I've got to know her name

She's so beautifully broken
Shaped by the wind
Dangerously twisted
Here I go again

I see the way she casts her spell
It's like drowning in moonlight
Discards them when she's done
They're lost in her twilight
I watch her move from star to star and I wonder why
Why it feels so right

She's so beautifully broken
You can barely see the flaw
Especially from a distance
Which is always how I fall

Why do I fall for the dangerous ones
The ones that never learned to let go
And why do I lie to myself and pretend that I can break her
When she's already been so beautifully broken

Why do I fall for the dangerous ones
The ones that don't know how to let go
And why do I lie to myself and pretend that I can break her

Can I borrow a fan, brother, you know
Say, say, say
I'd sure like just a dime
So I can buy some coffee and snacks
I guess I'd better stop trying to be hip and get on down
Hey man, you know

I was born in New York City
Saved by the night on a Monday
Trying to shoot the news
Not a bad cat, not a bad hat
Doing me a real big favor
Forget the bad cats and the bad hats
Playing it all real good
And a damn boy give me a shine, boy, ha!

When a cold wind comes in New, New York City
And the street's no place to be but there you are
So you try hard or die hard
No one really gives a damn to try hard
And to die hard, no one give a damn
And a damn boy give me a shine, boy, ha!

Down and out in New York City
This ain't no way to be
Oh boy, letting you go
When you're down and out in New York City
Never, never, never gonna get that way again
No, not me, when you need a friend
You need to have her
When you want a friend
Gonna get myself together in the morning
Gonna leave it all
I want my dream
All the bad cats and the bad hats
Doing me a real big favor
You've got the bad cats and the bad hats
Paying me all real good
And a damn boy give me a shine, boy, ha!
Give me a shine, boy

Down and out in New York City
This ain't no way to be
Oh boy, letting you go
When you're down and out in New York City
Never, never, never gonna get that way again
No, not me, when you need a friend
Troubled mind
When you need a friend
You've got a troubled mind
Ain't nobody gonna give you one thin dime
Friends can be cruel sometimes
And be sweet, but what?
What bugs a man, what hurts a man
When you give him a drink
Just can't get nothing to eat

Silent majority weren't keeping quiet anymore

Couldn't see a thing but open skies

Watching people as they pass by
But have you ever seen the gleam-It's a gleam
There's a gleam in Billy's eye

But nobody knows if he'll try to save the world
Or if he'll try to shoot the President
And nobody knows if he just needs a girl, 
Or if he wants to be a girl, 
Or if he just needs to feel like a man

Just before it backfired

Always had a thing for low I.Q.'s in high heels

She'll be whatever he wants her to be

That guides you through a cloudy day
When the stars ain't shinin' bright
And you fill like you've lost you're way
When the candle lights of home
Burn so very far away
Well you got to let your soul shine
Just like my daddy used to say

He used to say soul shine

It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain

We all get this way sometimes
Got to let your soul shine
Shine till the break of day

I grew up thinkin' that I had it made
Gonna make it on my own
But life can take the strongest man
And make him feel so alone
Now and then I feel a cold wind
Blowin' through my achin' bones
I think back to what my daddy said
He said â??Boy, in the darkness before the dawnâ??

Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul
A woman too, God knows, she can feel like this
And when your world seems cold
You got to let your spirit take control

Let your soul shine

It's better than moonshine

Tear me down

Me, I've been, and I'm going again

Worked my fingers to the bone
And you returned the favor

Now you want me to take you back

Worried down with the blues
Oh, yes I am
Worried down with the blues
Feel like I was born to lose
I used to walk with pride
With my head held high
Now I'm staring down at my shoes
Yes, I'm worried, worried down with the blues

You made me turn my back
On my very best friends
And when my back was turned
You were messin' around with them
Still I'd give up everything
To have you back by my side
'Cause in the cold, cold night
When I reach for you
All I'm holdin' is my foolish pride

Worried down with the blues
Oh, yes I am

Where she could go but not turn back

While fast her breath did fade away

I would not you see me so""

What goes on in that little toy brain
Who'll sweep out the wreckage, who'll sing the refrain
And after the smoke clears, is there anything left
Did you wash it all away

""Hold me, I'm lonely,"" you say to yourself
The only one who will listen now
So what does it mean when you finally explain you were never good at apologies

I've got some pride left, but it's plain to see
It's been earmarked for emergency
So what ever happened to your blind faith, did it crumble away
Like me, like me

What goes on in that little toy brain
Who'll sweep out the wreckage, who'll sing the refrain
And after the smoke clears, is there anything left
Did you wash it all away

How much longer can we keep our heads in the sand

Yeah, so sometimes we cried, maybe more than most, but so what
We shared everything, even some things we should not have shared
Like my separate reality, now there's only room for me

I walk among the criminals and I pray among the saints

And she won't let me down, 'cause I ain't never, never gonna let her in

Here in my back yard

And I lie awake
And I stare at the sky
And my life passes by
And I lie here suffering, wondering
How long, how long

In a sea of silence
I lay wondering
But with it comes no real solution
Dreams die young
In this world of violence
Just to be betrayed by revolution-revolution
Still my life is hard here in my back yard

And I lie awake
And I stare at the sky
And my life passes by
And I lie here suffering, wondering
How long, how long

We are only the beginning here
None of us will reach the end
So hold me close like an angel
With your breath draw me in
Feel me swim through your bloodstream
Hear my voice, soft but clear
After today things will never be the same
I'm sorry for you, my dear

In a world of darkness
We are surrounded, surrounded by eternity
We reach out but no love abounds us
Guess we traded it for sanity
Meanwhile life is hard here in my back yard

My mind is swollen from the weariness
Wish you'd never flagged me down

Twisted angel, cast out of some strange heaven
Sent down here to pull me out of my shell
You show up on my doorstep, honey dripping from your mouth
Like some slack jaw Jezebel

Flesh and bones is all I'm made of
I couldn't have stopped you if I tried
The spell you were casting, way too heavy
Now I can't be satisfied

But you think you're going to save me, you better think again
I've had saviors galore
And although you are a vision, an angel wrapped in sin
I've seen it all before

Twisted angel, cast out of some strange heaven
Sent down here, landed on my window sill
Now you're walking through my back door, honey dripping from your mouth
Like some slack jaw Jezebel

You've got your bag of dust and your divining rod
I wonder how I got myself here
Wheel's spinning faster and I know I have to jump off
Guess I'm weighing the fire against the fear

You spoon-fed my ego, made me feel so young
Kissed me 'til my lips were sore
But I know you're just a Jezebel with a poisonous tongue
I've been down this road before

It's full of twisted angels, cast out of some strange heaven
Sent down here to put me through Hell
You show up on my doorstep, honey dripping from your mouth

Gov't Mule,"Desiree's in disarray waiting for her angels to come
Where she used to feel the weight of a thousand lifetimes
Now she just feels numb
But there was a time when her beauty raised the eyebrows of the town
Any man would gladly give up all he had just to take Desiree down

She stares out the window at the world passing by
She is caught beneath the wheel
Too heavy to lift, she feels too weak to try
People stare like strangers where once she might've asked them in
To fill the void where her heart once was
Now she just fills her glass again
And again

And she walks the floor less traveled
Thinks of a sad melody
Wine and blood don't mix like they used to
Now they just make a memory
Too many years trying to do the right thing for the wrong man
Now the picture is clear
She drinks and she cries and she hides from the past
'Cause the truth is more bitter than the tears

All these half-truths and alibis help build a wall of denial
She takes comfort in the night, darkness blocks the light
From falling on her aging smile
Grey befalls her halo where there once was a golden mane
And her eyes don't shine like they used to
Without the moon, the sun would be in vain

So she walks the floor less traveled
Thinks of a sad melody
Wine and blood don't mix like they used to
Now they just make a memory
Too many years trying to the right thing for the wrong man
Now the picture is clear
She drinks and she cries and she hides from the past
'Cause the truth is more bitter than the tears

She puts on h er make-up, though no one's seen her for days
Her silence is a lonely cry
She's trapped inside a maze
Her tears have turned to honey, drawing the black flies of depression

You became a part of a new breed
Smokin' only the best weed
Hangin' out from the so called hippie set

And seen in all the right places
Seen with just the right faces
You should be satisfied but it ain't quite right

In an effort to find you a new you

There's one thing you should know

Gov't Mule,"When you can't find the light
That guides you through a cloudy day
When the stars ain't shinin' bright
And you feel like you've lost you're way
When those candle lights of home
Burn so very far away
Well you got to let your soul shine
Just like my daddy used to say.

He used to say soul shine
It's better than sunshine,
It's better than moonshine,
Damn sure better than rain.
Hey now people don't mind,
We all feel this way sometimes,
Got to let your soul shine,
Shine 'till the break of day.

I grew up thinkin' that I had it made,
Gonna make it on my own.
Life can take the strongest man,
Make him feel so alone.
Now and then I feel a cold wind,
Blowin' through my achin' bones,
I think back to what my daddy said,
He said ""Boy, in the darkness before the dawn""

Let your soul shine.
It's better than sunshine,
It's better than moonshine,
Damn sure better than rain.

Hey now people don't mind,
We all get this way sometimes,
Gotta let your soul shine,
Shine 'till the break of day.

Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness,
Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul.
A woman too, God knows, she can feel like this.
And when your world seems cold,
You got to let your spirit take control.

Talkin''bout soul shine,
It's better than sunshine,
It's better than moonshine,
Damn sure better than rain.
Lord now people don't mind,
We all feel this way sometimes,
Gotta let your soul shine,
Shine till the break of day.

I said it's better than sunshine,
It's better than moonshine,
Damn sure better than rain
Yeah now people don't mind,
We all get this way sometimes,
Gotta let your soul shine,
Shine 'till the break of day.",Reggae Soulshine

People I woke up this morning
I thought it was just a dream
Another real good friend of mine
Lost his way it seems
Shook my head and wondered
What's happening to all my brothers
Made me stop and realize it's time to love one another
(It's time to love one another)

So, bring on the darkness
Tonight is gonna be our friend
Bring on the crowd
We're all family in the end
Bring on the smoke and mirrors
Spread a little love across the night
And bring on the music
Everything's gonna be alright
(Gonna be alright)

Thought I heard a stranger calling out my name
Wasn't so loud just so nice and plain
Made me ask myself and wonder
Is it my time
But I got so much to live for

And bring on the music
Everything's gonna be alright
(Gonna be alright)

People when I lay down this evening
At the end of a long hard day
I don't want to be another brother
That's lost his way
I want to look around me
And cherish everything I see
I want to look behind me 
And know this is my destiny
I want to keep rejoicing 
Till I said all I got to say
And when my voice is gone
Wanna pick up my guitar and play
(wanna pick up my guitar and play)
(Oh, pick up my guitar and play)

So, bring on the darkness

Maybe you can recall that feeling now
Block out the memories of what happened overnight
Pretend that people aren't rioting in the streets
Pretend they didn't instill you with fear

Foresaken savior, where do we go from here

Do you have your sights set on another journey
Or is it finally time to throw in the towel
Are you scared the world will never sing your praises
Do you bury your head in the sand
Do you step up and take it like a man

Foresaken savior, it's all in your hand

If you find your way back to reality
I think you'll find it really hasn't changed that much

Foresaken savior, foresaken savior

Maybe you're out of touch
Isn't the whole story that you don't stop
Never stop believing in the message

So few can just refuse to fade away

You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.

Hot air for a cool breeze?

Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon

And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

You spoiled rotten you with the man is allowed you with temp you plotted
Ways to make cream and took the profits elsewhere money grip 
As far as I'm concerned your ass best not slip
Or get hit and injected with the truth to your vein
And a sticker on your face that reads ""GP the grain""
You wonder where this shit in my from recognition (what what what what

Where that shit came from instead you play dumb

Verse 1: Pop Da Brown Hornet

I want that everyday feeling to make me hit the ceiling
I get baleeveated, no more crack-dealin'
My nigga on the score, fly beard galore
Stepped out lookin' prettier then Prince Dejour
I see it clearly, I turn my dream into reality
Our short delayin' was a small technicality
Now I'm in the dick of things, feeling my oaths
I'm takin' hip-hop turn it up a thousand volts
Worldwide recognition take a look at what you missin'
The men who got the planet got crazy ambition
Packin' what you lackin'
Sluggin' shit like Reggie Jackson
Bitches diggin' me like niggas dig Toni Braxton
Distractions had to happen
Payin' dues from way-backin'
The days when Shaolin was simply known as Staten
Now I'm off the hook my schedule stay busy
Callin' dime peaces askin' (Where the hell is it?)
On a global escapade, gettin' high in the shade
Friday night baby girl and I just got payed
My whole squad is chalk, livin' large like Chrales in Charge
Far from a mirage, solid like steel bars
The clock's tickin' who wants to catch an ass-whippin'?
Rhymes get the rippin', and niggas get the bitch
And it's the format that I use from back when
Nineteen ninety-seven we in the top ten

Chorus:

We came to rock to rock it and tear down these walls
What you want to do? Ain't nuttin' but a party, party

Verse 2: June Lover

This is that type of underground shit you need
Every now and then to make your party proceed
Who am I? Another be	-Boy fan
Bringing you that hip-hop shit from Shaolin
I slam any MC upon his back
And play like a nerd and say ""did I do that""?
You lack the skills to be where I'm at
Son I'm top-notch while your ass be playin' hop-scotch
I'll be underground makin' moves with my shovel
Bubblin', while you exposed is still strugglin'
Who's mumblin' got you scared to speak
When I see you on the street you label us dead-meat
I'm out to getcha and got my gladiators for this picture
I could see it clear like a motion-made picture
I en-vision my arms wrapped around your throat
That's all she wrote, soon as i squeeze your neck broke

Chorus:

Party People, Party People, Party People, Party People (Are you ready?)
Better gather around GP's in town
(Are you ready, to get,  to get, to get sweaty?)
(Are ya, are ya, are ya ready for this?)
Ain't nuttin' but a party, party

One time for the cool guy
Blowing up my phone so I made time
Had you thinkin' you were so fine
And since I told you he was all mine
You’ve been keepin’ thizz poppin’ in my sideline
Sounds weird, but I can’t lie

that's why I hustle like I do
I gotta provide for my people

And nigga I done worked too hard
I done came too far to loose
can't stay still gotta stay on the move
Leave everyday with a point to prove

Hoping shit gone change
Now I'm A-Town bound nigga down for the grain
I'm feeling like I'm loosing my sane
Cause nigga?s round me been using cocaine
Now my dreams of fortune and fame won't be slain
Just gotta except that I'm on the road that was chose from above

I go and know you been waiting for a long time
Shorty keep a strong grind
Never give up the sun don't shine
See I'm where I belong now yeah

I'll fall to my knees and thank god that I'm blessed with
The strength to hold on and deliver the message

Grace Jones,"When I'm feelin' lonely,
Someone telephone me,
It's gettin' hard to pass my time.

Take me out'a dying,
Watch me while I'm flyin',
Baby, it's a waste of time.

I need a man, perhaps a man like you,
I need a man, to make my dreams come true.

Say that you will find him,
Creeping up behind him,
Moving round' the town all day.

Well, I'm underestimated,
Highly underated,
Can there be another way?

I need a man, perhaps a man like you,
I need a man, and I need a man.

And then I won't be feelin' lonely,
Knowing I'm the only one.

He'll understand,
Oh, what I'm feelin' deep inside me,
Knowing that at last he's gone.

Oh well,
Gettin' tired of lookin',
Wastin' all my cookin,
Ending in a dreadful row.

Can somebody tell me,
Say to me, or sell me,
Why I'm feelin' lonely, oh.

I need a man, perhaps a man like you,
I need a man to make my dreams,
And I need a man.

And at night I won't be lonely,
Knowing I'm the only one.

He'll understand,
Oh, what I'm feelin' deep inside me,
Knowing that at last he's gone.

It's maybe that I'm dreaming,
Can't say they I've seen him,
Somehow, I just got to find.

Someone outstanding,
Goes without [? ],

I need a man like you, to make my dreams come true,
Perhaps that man is you!

Your acting's a drag,
It's ok on TV, but you can turn it off,

Your marriage is a tragedy,
But it's not my concern,
I'm very superficial I hate everything official,
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out,(x2)

Your sentimental gestures only bore me to death,
You've made a deaperate appeal, now save your breath,
Attachment to obligation, through guilt and regret, shit that's so wet

And your sex life complications are not my facinations,
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out,(x2) Oh!

You asked my advice I say use the door,
But your still clinging to somebody you deplore,
And now you want to use me for emotional blackmail,
I just feel pity when you lie, contempt when you cry,

See the breaking glass,
Beneath the underpass.

Feel the crushing steel,
Feel the steering wheel.

Warm leatherette melts,
On your burning flesh,
You can see your reflection,
On the luminescent dash.

Warm leatherette,
A tear of petrol,
Is in your eye,
The hand brake,
Penetrates your thigh.

Is in your eye,
Quick let's make love,
Before we die.

Sans faire de bruit,
Et la mer efface sur le sable,

I knew I should've stayed in watching TV
If I'd looked at the moon and looked at my stars

I should've known when my car would not get started
It should've clicked when indecision read its question mark
If I'd ran back for the phone but instead I let it ring
I wouldn't be in this mess I'm in right now

Everybody hold still
Nobody gets hurt

I could've left all my cash and talent a credit card
I should've said, ""Don't wear no jewelery you're looking fine""
If I'd ran back for the phone but instead I let it ring

It is the original breath , it is the whisper of unremitting demand.

What do you think you can still draw from my lips?
Exact presence that no fantasy can represent.
Purveyor of the old secret, alive with the blood that boils again,
And is pulsing where the rhythm is torn apart.
How your singer's blood is incensed at the depth of sound.
Lacerations echo in the mouth's open erotic sky where dance together,
The lost trenches of rhythm and an imploring immobility...

Lonely nights, spent all alone by a lonesome telephone,
You never called, you'd never come,
I just wanted someone to love, so I became a victim for love.

Darling I, I was a fool and so you used me just like a clown,
Oh I just wanted someone to love, so I became a victim for love.

je veux te baiser, tu le mal que tu m'as fait,

Baby all on a summer night
And everything will turn out right

You're even better in the morning light
Funny tinglings moving up my spine
It may be love or maybe just the wine
The sun's begun to turn my head around
Or is it you that make my temples pound?

All alone here on the beach tonight
With the moon and the stars
And the sound of the waves
Oh, I know this night will never end
I love you darling, always

The evening tide is washed up on our feet
We're all alone here on this beach again
Let's take a swim and wash away the sand

Remains over time

No movement, no colors

Rise and fall of shame
A search that shall remain
You asked me where I am
I said I didn't care

Sound formed in a vacuum
May seem a waste of time
It's always been just the same
No hearing, no breathing
No movement, no colors
Just silence

Rise and fall of shame
A search that shall remain
You asked me what you'd seen
I said I didn't care

One who keeps tearing around,
One who can't move,
Where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns,

Just when I'd stopped opening doors,
Finally knowing the one that I wanted,
Was yours,
Making my entrance again with my,
Usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
No one is there,

Don't you love farce?
My fault I fear,
I thought thar you'd want what I want,
Sorry my dear,
And where are the clowns?
Quick send in the clowns,
Don't bother, they're here,

In my career,
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns,

And ol' midnight knows it, too

Does it mean that our love is ending

You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

Grace Potter,"I drove a long, long way without drinking
I listened to the Baptist Radio
There was a blue-gray sky as I passed the ghost town by
And headed down to where nobody knows me

I was jaded by another passing lover
I couldn't bring myself to wonder why
And the man on the radio said
?Hey, don't you wanna got down to Deliverance Road??

I saw three little birds sitting on a doorstep
And two little boys in their Sunday best
And the preacher?s voice was strong
The big lady sang along, as I listened
Rolling down Deliverance Road, Deliverance Road

I may never walk through the gates of heaven
I may never hear the angel?s serenade
But when the wind picks up and drags the dust
I'm gonna stop my car, look straight up
And the rain might wash my sins away

But after all the trucks stops
And tumble weeds have faded
And the radio sings a country song

I?ll still hear the preacher ma
Doing the best that he can
To send us down Deliverance Road

We sink to the bottom

?I've got something to say, so lady, let's begin?

So I bummed a ride from Bessie
My old school friend
She said, ?Honey, where you want to go??

But all I said is, ?I think this might be the end
And I'm feeling sick so could you drive me slow??
Because my man he up and left me, left me in dust

You'd better drop a line
Or else you're leaving me out in cold

He said he's lost his only friend
He's got a jar of cash to spend
He's running off just like he done before

And he made a stop down the track
He sold his favorite leather hat
He told the man he won't be back
And rounded out an old unsettled score

But oh this 'ain't the first time that I've been left behind

I'd cook his lunch and wash his clothes
He'd tend the fence and shoot the crows
And somewhere in there we got close
They say a handy man is hard to find

He bought the farm, I sold my car
He left me with a silver scar
He's colder then a steel guitar
He always said he ain't the loving kind

But I said oh this 'ain't the first time that I've been left behind

Well some days I cry like a child
Other days I ramble wild
He's got me so goddamn beguiled
And I don't even know his middle name

And he's been lost and found before
I've stopped waiting by the door
But I still love him to the core
I only wish that he could do the same

But oh this 'ain't the first time that I've been left behind

Well he don't call and he don't write
He slips on in after midnight
I never turn off my porch light
He always finds his way back my place

And I never ask him for a ring

And helped himself to everything
And now I'm here without a speck of grace

Grace Potter,"O Lord, I think I'm falling to my disbelief
I'm cursing like a sailor and lying like a thief
It?s hard to heed the calling from the better side of me
When I'm blaming everybody else and no one?s coming clean

O Lord, can You see my thick skin wearing thin ?
And the demons of a lesser me are beckoning me in
Those who gathered 'round me I'm watching them all leave
'Cause I am my own ragged company

So you can take a trip to China or take a boat to Spain
Take a blue canoe around the world and never come back again
But traveling don't change a thing, it only makes it worse
Unless the trip you take is in to change your cruel course

?Cause every town?s got a mirror
And every mirror still shows me
That I am my own ragged company
I am my own ragged company

Won't You help me, Lord?
Won't You help me, Lord?
Someone cut the cord
And I'm falling down again

Oh, it?s lonely, Lord, it?s mighty cold
And I don't wanna live this way
Afraid of growing old

It?s hard to heed the warning when you cannot see the crime
The only way to remember is to forget in a rhyme
And I'm scared to tread the red road that leads to Galilee
'Cause I am my own ragged company
I am my own ragged company
I am my own ragged company

It took a while to realize
That you would never want to be around
Without your feet on the ground

Then you crossed that razor sharp line
There's no soft edges I can find
There's no turning back this time
You're just gone

Now I gotta let you go
So it won't hurt no more
If I could let you go
Then I wouldn't feel sick no more

Sometimes I wonder
If we hadn't gotten so close
This wouldn't hurt as much I suppose
I could survive a hundred lonely years
If I could get back just a moment

Can smile about all these lonely memories

Nobody's born with a broken heart

Once there was a restless father
Who walked out on his one and only son
And now he's saving up to buy a guitar
So he can write his own redemption song
Lonely is the wayward mother, she says
I swear I'm gonna get it right one of these days
But once you let somebody break you down
You just get used to feeling that way
But I say

Nobody's born with a broken heart

There's a young man living under the freeway
He sleeps in any warm place he can find
And he's still looking for the strangers
Who gave him green eyes and a restless smile
He spends his days on Beggars' Corner
As the people toss their coins and move along
One day a strange man with a guitar sat beside him
Closed his green eyes and played the boy a song
Hey hey

Chained to circumstance
And they're not asking for a miracle
All they want is a second chance

Ich suche dich in leeren Regalen,
Will dich identifizieren,
Muss tausende Phantombilder malen,

Und ich pflaster die Lücken
Doch es will blühen mit aller Gewalt,
Ich stolper immer wieder drüber,
Greif nach deiner Hand,
Greif in die Luft,
Ich hab dich nie gekannt,
Ich pflaster die Lücken
Doch es will blühen mit aller Gewalt,

Die Kiste ist jetzt auf,
Licht fällt rein, und das was bleibt,
Ist vielleicht nur ein Mensch wie ich,
Kein Voodu, kein dunkler geist
Die Fetzen falsch zusammengeklebt,
Schizophräne Sehnsucht, das nich' mal Wut,
Denn nach allem was geschehen ist,
Seh ich dich in mei'm Gesicht,
Fließt du in meinem Blut

Then came the circus so I followed it's parade

I saw those high-stepping sexy witches
Sons of satin, sons of bitches - all were there in my dreams
all in my dreams

I see you're back in town.
And though you build a wall around you
The multitude still found you

Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar has given you the call

And call Alice, when she was just small

When the men on the chessboard get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom, and your mind is moving low

I'm taking you back
Here's another one

Uh, yeah
I remember being on that nigga's chair, hard
Back in the day in the projects
Chasing after him, a lil' young chick
Seeing him made me go back in my lab
And write this lil' shit like this
Check it out

Here's how it goes
Used to see you when I went to the store
Always watch you play ball from my bedroom window
The places you frequent, the chicks you freaked with
The spot in the grass where you kept your stash

I used to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes
If you ever noticed me and knew I was alive
I tried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs
With hopes to get close to you

Used to dream about you right before I went to sleep
Used to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets
Used to practice what I'd say for the day that we meet
Used to pray every day for the day that we meet

Used to hang with your sis if she only knew
I only hung with that bitch to get closer to you
Wasn't no limit to the things I would do
To give all my love to you, my God

Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you

'cause I'm always thinking of you

I just don't want to stop
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much
(Yeah, uh huh, yeah, Queen Pen take it to the Brooklyn Bridge)

Stop being by yourself, now you hung with the crew
I took the bangs out my hair over the summer, I grew
Me and my friends, all virgins, all learning, 
How to tow that shit, how to throw that shit

Talked about that sex like I was used to it
Lying about how many you used to kiss
In the hallways, all day, 'till it was real
In the staircase, lights out, giving out feels

Put your name in my notebook, we all did that
Lined our names up with numbers to see if they matched
Scared to death 'bout the first time, I knew it would hurt
In your house, on your mother's couch, she was at work

Dead wrong, but head strong, ya had in this broad
The only one I ever loved ever since I was young
Once in a while I even cut school to give all my love to you

Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you

Into her rooms with her tapestries red

And he bowed her down to the ground

""Tell me how hungry are you? How weak you must feel
As you are living here alone, and you are never revealed
But I won't march again on your battlefield""

And she wanted more than she ever could say
But she knew how it frightened her, and she turned away
And would not look at his face again

To get all I deserve and to give all I can
And to love a young woman who I don't understand

And she stood there, ashamed of the way her heart ached
She took him to the doorstep and she asked him to wait

J'ai fais croire à cette petite salope que j'avais du buzz
J'lui ai dis que j'connaissais 2-3 footeux juste pour voir ses fesses
J'ai fais croire à ce petit fils de pute que j'vendais de la cess'
Je lui ai donné rendez-vous cagoulé, calibré pour prendre son pèse

Ils parlent mal, c'est nos élèves
Ils ont trop sucé, ils en ont plein les lèvres
Si y'a la somme, bien sûr qu'on les lève
Elevé par les loups, faut pas qu'on nous énerve
Dis-leur mon Sheguey, ouais que du bluff
Y'a ceux qu'ont deux meufs, et ceux qu'ont deux 9
Ceux qui ont des 9, ceux qu'ont des 9

Je ken la vie par le cul, comme ça qu’on fait l’amour
Comme ça qu’on fait l’amour, le bif ou le placard
Le nez dans les affaires et toi dans la came
Jamais fumé de la caille pourquoi faire du vacarme
On a des silencieux, viens donc voir dans ma cave
Je sais qu’en vrai, tu rêves d’être à moi
Y'a des grosses couilles, des mitraillettes à mort
Te niquer ta mère, c’est comme ça qu’on t’aborde
Malgré tous nos péchés y'a qu’Allah qu’on adore
J'ai fait 800 bornes
J’ai roulé 10 pecs, 40 kil de peuf, 6 litrons de zipét

J'te baise et tu payes, ramène ta chatte

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride

Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring

You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet

Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine

We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place

Grady Tate,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares

My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you

I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are 
Songs to be sung 
Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.

And I cant wait to get on the road again

On the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again
And I can't wait to get on the road again

Leave me along, let me go home

Leave me along, let me go home

Leave me along, let me go home

C'est pourquoi tu veux rester
Sur un plateau d'argent

Et quand tu voudrais lui dire
Tu n'as pas d'amour pour elle
Elle t'appelle dans ses ondes
Et laisse la mer r?pondre
Que et depuis toujours tu l'aimes

Tu veux rester à ses côtés
Maintenant tu n'as plus peur

Qui a veillé très longtemps
Du haut d'une tour solitaire
Et quand il a compris que seuls
Les hommes perdus le voyaient
Il a dit qu'il voguerait
Jusqu'à ce que les vagues nous libèrent
Mais lui-même fut bris?
Bien avant que le ciel s'ouvre
Délaissé et presque un homme
Il a coulé sous votre sagesse
Comme une pierre.

A vacuum that goes either way
But there must be something else to it
'Cause the sun comes to me every day

When I see the truth I see it with my own imagery
It's my brain lying, trying to make me see,
That the truths is so big that it runs eternity
And small enough to fit inside me
 
 Far away past a star into the void inside of me
Or smaller past the atoms that have nothing inside
Just the same as a car or a leaf or a star
Cannot move without command
Something moves me and without it I'd be no more living

Yeah, life starts to twist and turn

Fuckin' memories, we cried so many tears
Oh, the devil plays the repo man
And he's suckin' up souls as fast as he can

A .45 brings out the criminal behavior
When the clouds in the sky turn black and gloom
As soon as the smoke starts to fill the room

And the feelin' that you get is somewhat spiritual
I'm a have to let you know how reality go
Learn to fly like The Crow as you slide into limbo

Graeme Revell,"[Verse 1]
Yeah... KRS-One bout to wreck the joint
I was seen openin up at the edge of Detroit
Where the cops go beyond the laws
Where enemies work together by putting they shit on pause
So what does it mean, Assault on Precinct 13?
You are bout to see just what the dirt bring
It's working, that force, I have been searching
Like Lawrence Fishburne when it's time to hurt things
Ethan Hawke, man he face all that
I hold the mic like Ja held the baseball bat
I stay ahead, like a baseball cap
The ways of the world, Kris don't chase all that

[Chorus]
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?

[Verse 2]
Well as I walk through the street, my spirit will speak
To those I meet and great from week to week
I am not my handsome beat. I command the speak
As the observer inside the physique
Many rappers try to compete, of course
But they got smashed and trashed in the streets and tossed
Sometimes I think we all just lost
We just flashin and flossin the disastrous cause
We don't even know the one-ness of the only force
Instead of a golden calf, we got a platinum horse
But what did Moses do with the golden calf?
Threw the log at it and it ended in a blast
Master, get on them quick, get on them faster
In the background you frontin, 'cause there's nothing but laughter
I tag church like the shirt king
Turn up the track for Assault on Precinct 13

[Chorus]
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?

[Verse 3]
Wow, what an ending. What a conclusion
They thought they was winning, but they really was losin
He though he was sinnin, but he really was provin
That leadership keeps it moving, steady cruising
Guns up, funds up, from sun up to sun up to sun up
Buck buck buck! Yo, duck duck
We run up, two down, one up
Dope MCs see me and get butterflies in they stomach
Others can't speak, they just shut up
KRS on the come up, liftin Big Pun up. Let me sum up
Dope MCs, wack MCs, thin MCs, fat MCs, commercial MCs, they can't all
Get done up
Raise the drum up, breath for breath, I'll rip your lung up
On my trophy wall, I'm nailing your tongue up
KRS-One, you know what it means
Turn up the track for Assault on Precinct 13

[Chorus]
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?

[Verse 4]
We gotta start trusting each other right now if we gonna make it
Through this night
From Criminal Minded to Spiritual Minded, and even beyond and behind
It, never be afraid to fight
Or be the lazy type. Me, I'm the crazy type
I get them clubs so crazy hype
I throw them glasses on that them ladies like
And years later, rock what they babies like
I blaze the light, there me be 8,000,000 ways to die
But there's 16,000,000 ways to fight
So wherever you are... in the crib or your car, in your tank too
KRS-One would like to thank you, right

In Camden Town
In Camden Town you can do anything you want to

A drunken busker hits the pavement, sending hot-dogs in the air
Towards a broken down bus full of people going nowhere
A string of Irish pubs as far as you can see
Greek, Indian, Chinese or would you like a cup of tea?

There's tapas, fracas, alcohol, tobaccos
Bongs, bongo bingo, Portuguese maracas
There's reggae in the jeggae, music everywhere
Every kind of song and dance, madness in the air

In Camden Town I'll meet you by the underground
In Camden Town we'll walk there as the sun goes down

The tourists sing
Ooooh, they sing
Ooooh, sing up
Ooooh

And what's my name in invisible game?

The two fat Americans interrupt their stay
They put down their bags, they were clamped and towed away
There's Turksh cakes, designer fakes, fathers dressed as nuns
Every kind of music here, the night has just begun

Who didn't know how to enjoy his life
Too busy running down the street
Running just following his feet

As a younger bristling boy
Bursting through the world
Night time obsessions
Like all the boys and girls
Twisting turn of left and right
Body soul and mind
Searching through dry autumn leaves
For things he cannot find

Oh girl, you've got me in a whirl
Oh girl, girl, you've got me in a whirl

Who started hanging round in unromantic places
Who pretty soon thought he'd really lost his mind
And when it's gone it's pretty hard to find

As he rounded the corner I sighted him up down the barrel of the gun and on seeing his expression Change to one of horror + confusion jerked back the trigger.

Lamp lights in houses
Warmth obscured
No cause for worry

No need to cry anymore

But don't stay that way

This motorbike ain't got no wheels anymore
This roller coaster ain't no fun anymore
This skateboard is burnt and just won't roll anymore

The towns ripped up with people dead on the floor
The church fell down and there's no God anymore
And all the rock stars don't look so sad anymore

I'll take my money and burn it down
This ain't so funny, I've had it now
I know you're gonna kill me man

When you said that to me
With your mud red eyes looking straight through me

And life's hollow and absurd
And I, I'll just never learn

After you said that to me
You bared you teeth so white

And you, you're just so complete
And I, I'm just such a freak
And we, we just can't compete

I got that feeling and it's weighing me down

And I feel if I get to talk to you
Like something's gotta, like the suns gotta shine 

It's always been so difficult to talk to you in my small dark place
And everything I feel so strange about keeps on changing its shape
One day I might open my eyes and decide that I am dead
Until that day I'll just try and dream of you inside my head

You were soiled
You are now
I want you
To feel real blue

All my life I'm beginning to feel like
I'm running to where nothing really exists
And I, write a thought of mine on my t-shirt instead
I feel like a child, I put pen to paper and I'm beginning to cry
And all you can do is absorb my tears when I do not say bye bye

You're so good
You are mine
I'm so bad

Graham Coxon,"Walls bleed pictures bend their fractured frames
Features on canvas torn
Burning mirror breaking down to sand
Free from jails of form

The black water future I see
So hard to drain
The small child in everyone is forced to bleed
To live life again

The light ever closer we believe
Is only a place for grief
Every life's so small we call it precious
And every soul is so loved above 

Days glide through a skin of open pores
Stretched on bended frames
Years long on sanded banks around your shores
Counting every grain

Words form poisoned worlds I never see
So hard to hear
Ring the bell of truth in every dream
No life, no fear

Every night brings disasters to our rooms
A life time inside you",A Place for Grief
Graham Coxon,"Saw the news in the afternoon
'Nother war will be coming soon

With his wife looking on and no one to help her

The world will burn cause the world won't learn

Looks like I'm gonna build my shelter again
Such a messed up world we're living in today
Thank God for the rain, maybe it'll wash that scum away

Streets ain't safe in this town no more
A girl get hassled at her front door
Violence rising out of hand
Can't bring the kids up in this land

Getting mugged on your way home
By kids with masks and knives they own
How long will it be 'til they got a gun
And hoot you down just like a dog for fun

Such a messed up world we're living in today
Thank God for the rain, maybe it'll wash that scum away

Instead my own phobia eccentricity is growing out of every bit of me
I like my home I don't want to move but maybe I'll be forced soon
To lock the doors and board up the windows

Looks like I'm gonna build my shelter again
Such a messed up world we're living in today
Thank God for the rain, maybe it'll wash that scum away

People die and nature replaces
You see the lives in all the faces
Of so-called lunatics and basket cases
Who'd hang themselves with their shoe laces

They have no place in the rat race
As a society which just misplaces
Puts more importance on money not faces
And have it's sleeves filled with all the aces

The voices rang so true
The knowledge that was lacking
Cut innocence in two
Everything seemed too good to be right
When I was 16
I was too uptight 

Now disappointment's shadow
Reveals a colder time
A harder kind of living
In disillusion
How can it go
The fear of the night
Now I am grown
I'm just too uptight

A slow and noble breakdown of personality
Careless, heartless, soulless,
No dignity
My days are flown
And I can't recall
Feeling so alone
Was I so uptight

Take five it heals in time

And I'm still not sure, I want to change mine

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover,

She wore a lovely meatball on her finger

Graham Dalby,"In Tropical climes there are certain times of day
When all the citizens retire to take their clothes off and perspire
It's one of those rules the greatest fools obey
Because the Sun is far too sultry and one must avoid its ultra-violet rays

The natives grieve when the White Men leave their huts
Because they're obviously....definitely....Nuts!

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The Japanese don't care to, the Chinese wouldn't dare to
Hindus and Argentines sleep firmly from twelve till one
But Englishmen detest-a siesta

In the Philippines they have lovely screens to protect you from the glare
In the Malay States there are hats like plates which the Britishers won't wear
At twelve noon the natives swoon and no further work is done
But mad dogs and Englismen go out in the midday sun

It's such a surprise for the Eastern eyes to see
That though the English are effete, they're quite impervious to heat
When the White Man rides, every native hides in glee
Because the simple creatures hope he will impale his solar topi on a 
tree

It seems such a shame when the English claim the Earth
That they give rise to such hilarity and mirth

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The toughest Burmese bandit can never understand it
In Rangoon the heat of noon is just what the natives shun
They put their Scotch or Rye down and lie down

In a jungle town where the Sun beats down to the rage of man and beast
The English garb of the English Sahib merely gets a bit more creased
In Bangkok at twelve o'clock they foam at the mouth and run
But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The smallest Malay rabbit deplores this foolish habit
In Hong Kong they strike a gong and fire off a noonday gun
To reprimand each inmate, who's in late

In the mangrove swamps where the python romps there is peace from 
twelve till two
Even caribous lie around and snooze for there's nothing else to do
In Bengal to move at all is seldom if ever done

And runners are walking

But no one is going to break my heart again
I used to be a King and everything around me turned around

But I know all I have to do is sing
And I'll life myself way off the ground
But it's all right I'm O.K. How are you?
For what it's worth I must say I loved you

And in my bed where are you
Someone is going to take my heart
But no one is going to break my heart again",I Used to Be a King
Graham Nash,"On the end of a tight rope I'm over the town
I'd be good in a circus but so would a clown
From the way that I feel all my hang-ups are down

In the middle of nowhere I found me a tree
And the fruit that we live on reminds me of me
Though we live in the air I'm not sure that we're free

I don't really have much to say
'Cause I'm living from day to day
Somewhere

And I don't care what the people say
'Cause if everyone knows the way
We're nowhere

Two and two make four they never make five
And as long as we know it we all can survive
Make sure that the things you do keep us alive

I don't really have much to say
'Cause I'm living from day to day
Somewhere

And I don't care what the people say
'Cause if everyone knows the way
We're nowhere

Is the image I'm making the image I see
When the man in the mirror is talking to me
",Man in the Mirror
Graham Nash,"In an upstairs room in Blackpool
By the side of a northern sea
The army had my father
And my mother was having me

Military Madness was killing my country
Solitary Sadness comes over me
After the school was over and I moved
To the other side

I found a different country but I never
Lost my pride
Military Madness was killing the country
Solitary sadness creeps over me

And after the wars are over
And the body count is finally filed
I hope that The Man discovers
What's driving the people wild

Military madness is killing your country
So much sadness, between you and me
War, War, War, War, War, War",Military Madness
Graham Nash,"I am a simple man
So I sing a simple song
Never been so much in love
And never hurt so bad
At the same time

I am a simple man
And I play a simple tune
Wish that I could see you once again
Across the room
Like the first time

Just want to hold you
Don't want to hold you down
Hear what you're saying
And you're spinning my head around
And I can't make it alone

The ending of the tale
Is the singing of the song
Make me proud to be your man
Only you can make me strong
Like the last time

Just want to hold you
Don't want to hold you down
I hear what you're saying
And you're spinning my head around
I can't make it alone",Simple Man
Graham Nash,"By Graham Nash

When you were asleep
I was kissing your forehead
You gave a frown
So I kissed you again
You started waking
And put your arms round my waist
Just making sure I was there
Then you drifted away
Then you drifted away
And when I awoke
I found out I'd been dreaming
Some of my bed clothes were still on the floor
I looked around
Realized you were leaving me
I saw the back of your dress
As you slipped through the door
As you slipped through the door
And when I return
I will kiss your eyes open
Take off my clothes
And I'll lie by your side
Then I will wait
Till The sandman is done with you
And as you sleepily rise
You'll find I'll be there
You'll find I'll be there
There, there

Graham Nash,"We can heed the call
We can trip and fall
We can read the scrawl on the garden wall
Let the ashes fall
Upon us all or not at all it's in us all
Can we say it's cool
From a heated pool
When we give a jewel to a starving fool
And if we can't be cruel
Then let us take the tool
And change the rule, change the rule
When we've all begun to see the world we're on
Don't you see there's only one
Then we'll all begin to see the skin we're in
It's just the same
There's only one
There's only one
Do we have the grace to begin the race
In another place
Face to face
Do we stand the pace or do we let the case go to
Waste, got to waste, go to waste
Do you like the taste",There's Only One

Graham Nash,"I've watched you go through changes
That no man should face alone
Take to heel or tame the horse
The choice is still your own
But arm yourself against the pain
A wounded bird can give
And in the end remember
It's with you you have to live
And in the end remember
It's with you you have to live
Stand your ground I think you've got
The guts it takes to win
But you must learn to turn the keys
Before she'll let you in
And understand the problems of the girl you want
So near or you'll wear the coat of questions `til the
Answer hat is here
You'll wear the coat of questions `til the
Answer hat is here
Serenade your angel with a love song from your eyes
Grow a little taller even though your age defies
Feel a little smaller
And in stature you will rise

And humble pie is always hard to swallow

Graham Nash,"I tried to reach beyond the walls you're living in
As a friend I flew a long way for a friend
But the way you treated me
Made me feel like giving in
I don't know if I'll break or only bend
You're supposed to be my friend

And if you carry on the way you did today
All the music in my veins will turn to stone
All the faking of your friendship
Doesn't make it anyway
Does it get you off to act so all alone
It'll chill you to the bone

So my advice to you is not to take advice
From the dealers who are handing out the cards
Take your life into your own hand
Just have faith in who you are
And all your goodness that I'm forced to disregard
Because you make it much to hard.",Frozen Smiles

Dyin' in the rain

Wiser than you
Half and inch taller
A deeper shade of blue
Or thinkin' that I loved you
More than you loved me
Failing to lay it on the line
All the time

The game of gettin' money
The game of gettin' more
The ego game of power
The ugly game of war
Kills love
Don't you know that?

Born in the sunshine
Dyin' in bad air
Started out honest
Wound up down there
Love you

Looking over all the Haight
As far as my eyes can see
What's happening to me? Trying to find
A girl to be on my mind.

Come another year-will she be here?
I wonder what I'm looking for
But I'm looking everyday
Searching every face-trying to find
A girl to be on my mind.

On my mind there is a question
Time-time
Only time will tell when time is right
I await my resurrection

Shining and feeling clean
Could it be a sin?

Let me in-let me in-immigration man
Can I cross the line and pray
I can stay another day
Let me in immigration man
I won't toe your line today
I can't see it anyway

There he was with his immigration face
Giving me a paper chase
But the sun was coming
Cos all at once he looked into my space
And stamped a number over my face
And he sent me running

Can I cross the line and pray
I can stay another day
Let me in immigration man
I won't toe your line today

So long as you think you can
You'd better watch out-watch out-for the man
Anywhere you're going.

That you should grab a hold of it
Else you'll find
It's passed you by

Rainbows all a round
Can you find the silver and gold?
It'll make you old
The river can be hot or cold
And you should dive right into it
Else you'll find

Can you carry the torch that'll bring home the dead?
To the land of their fathers whose lives you have led
To the station at the end of the town
On the southbound train going down..

Equality, quietly facing the fist
Are you angry and tired that your point has been missed?
Will you go in the back-room
And study the list
Of the gamblers using the phone
On the southbound train going down

Fraternity, failing to fight back the tears
Will it take an eternity breaking all the fears?
And what will the passenger do when he hears-
That he's already paid for the crown
On the southbound train going down.",Southbound Train

Than the one before

Where do I go from here? Help me.
I wish I could disappear and go away
From the knowing
That you've known me far too long.
When I find a different tune
I guess I'll sing a different song

Graham Nash,"You are walking
You've always been walking
Stumbling half-blinded
And dry as the wind
That strafes you and leaves you
To lie in the sand
And the wall stretches endless beside you to nowhere
This wall that you've been trying to cross for years
This fence made of tears
No one hears

You see a door
Ah, such a great open door
You know that your eyes tellin' lies
Still you chance
A shambling run, a ridiculous dance
Like a scarecrow that's hung up to dry on a fencepole
And there's a place like vacuum waiting inside you
For you to get through
To the blue

You scent the water
Fresh green grass, food and water
Your breath is scraping your brain into dust
Your rusty old engine is ready to bust
You cannot believe it that they would not trust you
The door is wavering
Is that your eyes?
Are they still telling lies?
What are lies?",The Wall Song

What am I going to do?",Where Will I Be?

Can you see around the bend?
Can you see?

On what star do you take your sight
On a cold and blowy night
Alone, alone?

Old man can you make a mirror for me?
It's got to be clearer than air for me
Cause you see I can't see me, no

And I always thought that I meant what I said

We were lying

All of us lying
Just making it up, yeah
Cutting it out of whole cloth, yeah.",Whole Cloth

Well, there's one thing to try
Everybody knows
Music gets you high
Everybody grows
And so it goes

You're the lips that make the laughter
You're the sunshine in the snow
Shining out on everything you feel
You're the bird that dropped the berry
On the island far below
Finding out that everything is real

[Chorus]

We are loved and we are lonely
We are many, we are few
Make it out of love and build a dream
We are hobos, we are holy
We are me and we are you,

Graham Nash,"All is need is someone to awaken me
Much of me has gone to sleep and I'm afraid to wake up
Shake me by the shoulder if I'm lying with you now

When I talk about the time I sleep away
When it's hard to face the day.
When I think of all the love that's taken me
How much do I get to keep and much should I give up?

Shake me by the shoulder if I'm lying to you now
I'm listening to the lies inside my head
Who can hurt you in your bed?
Fear of other people is a thing I hate

I travel in a bubble and I can't relate.
Something is happening to my head
I don't want to hurt you
But I never heard a word you said

Has this empty hollow heart forsaken me?
I wonder if I'll ever get to feel like I did
Before I grew up.
Shake me by the shoulder if I'm lying with you now

'Cause we watch them fly away.",Another Sleep Song

Houses falling and they're falling still
Lightning striking - take cover!

Watch the weather take a turn.
Shake the trees and let the leaves fall where they will
Pile them up and let'em burn.

Waiting for the stars to give you answers
Eating in your cars and building fences
Is this what we've come to?

Hey you, wailing by the wall
Hoping it'll fall in their direction
Waiting for another resurrection
Is this what we've come to?

Tell me how come everything appears to be hazy?
Nothing left to see
Tell me how come everyone appears to be crazy, too?

Tell me how come everything appears to be hazy?
Nothing left to see
Tell me how come everyone appears to be crazy, too?

Will you tell all the people
'bout the people you killed,
Not for God, but for country and war?

Oh! Camil, tell me what did you mother say,
When you left those people out in the fields,
Rotting along with the hay?
Did you show her your medals?
Did you show her your guns?
Did you show her the ears that you wore?
Did you show her a picture of the people you killed
Not for God, but for country and war?

Oh! Camil, tell me why are you in this place?
When you stood up for justice your country replied
By throwing it back in your face.

Are you making amends for all of the hatred you saw?
Will you tell all the people about the people that cry out for God
Not for country or war?",Oh! Camil (The Winter Soldier)

I can barely stand it, what you're doing to me

And in the morning, will you still feel the same?
How're you gonna stop yourself from going insane
With glowing children and a barrel of pain?
I don't want to hear it no more, no

I can see the heat begin to rise, I can see the vapors in my eyes
Any way you look at this, it?s hard to take
I can feel my skin begin to peel, I can see the dollar and the deal
I can see the companies that are on the make, yes, they are

And in the morning, will you still feel the same?
How're you gonna stop yourself from going insane
With glowing children and a barrel of pain? I don't
Want to hear it no more, no more

And in the morning, will you still feel the same?
How're you gonna stop yourself from going insane
With glowing children and a barrel of pain?
I don't want to hear it no more, no

I can really feel it getting through to me

I can barely stand it, what you're doing to me, to me

And in the morning, will you still feel the same?
How're you gonna stop yourself from going insane
With glowing children and a barrel of pain?
I don't want to hear it, hear it, hear it

Hear it, hear it, hear it, I don't want to hear it
I don't want to hear it, no more no more hear it
I don't want to hear it, think about the babies, hear it
Think about the babies, hear it, what about the children, hear it?

I don't want to, hear it, I don't want to, hear it
No more pain oh no, hear it, I don't want, hear it
No, no, no, no more, hear it, I just don't want to hear it
I don't want to, hear it",Barrel of Pain
Graham Nash,"Late last night, did I dream?
Over the hill and far away
They wanted to live in pleasure
They wanted to live above the plains

Holier than thou, banking on a cloud
Never coming down to earth and sky

Did I dream, so late at night?
I saw dinosaurs and sabre tooth
Gambling with the treasure

Holier than thou, banking on a cloud
Never coming down to earth and sky
Down to earth and sky

I awake, I awake
I think I'm safe in my room

Better luck next time.

Awake the sleeping rage inside
Disarm the people, keep ?em all confused
Kill before they turn the tide

Burning down the very heart of town

But Greenwood don't you cry, just shout it right out loud

It's hard to rise above it all
'Can't we get along?' I heard somebody say

Love knows no rhyme

I?ll be there for you wherever

And I'll always be there
I can honestly tell you
That I really don't care
If all the babies are broken
And the old folks are blind
There's a hole in my heart
But I know you don't mind
If I laugh at the cripples
And I cry for the clowns
And I welcome the madness
That I see coming down
And I have no opinions
So I feel no remorse
I can see the Black Knight
Riding up on his horse
And there's fire in his nostrils
And blood in his eyes
And he's looking at you, kid
As he races on by
So watch out for his hooves
They're going to kill you for sure
He's got some kind of sickness
That no man can cure
And his breath it will burn you
And put out your eyes
He'll tear out your tongues
So you can't even cry
That your body is broken
And your spirit is dead
And you hope against hope
That it's a bad dream you had
About a meeting with Elvis
At the back of the store
You're both shoveling plastic ware
Right out of the door
And the men who control you
Keep yelling for more, more, more, more
You pay all your taxes
But you don't know what for
'Cause nothing seems to get better
Things seem to get worse
We're all living in danger
From a politician's curse
All promises have been broken
All lips have been read
Well the mouth has spoken
But nothing's been said
The dream has been shattered
The flags have been burned
You better make up your minds
From whatever you've learned
About your family values
And the way they've been scorned
Some babies have been battered
Way before they've been born
Some call me a liar
Some call me a thief
But the way that I look at things
I can't get no relief
So I went to a meeting
Spoke out of fear
They said Thank you for sharing
Now why are you here?
I said everything's shaking
Including myself
I keep all my feelings
High up on a shelf
And I can't seem to reach them
But I know they were there
I'm trapped in this vacuum
And I'm gasping for air
Some people get better
Some people just fall
Some people rise above it
Or so I've been told
So I started to leave
I was searching for more
They caught a hold of my sleeve
But I slipped through the door
I ran back to the office
With my back to the wall
When I came to my senses
I had no one to call
So I called up the doctor
He told me to lie
He said Get out of this nightmare
Or you surely will die
So I forced myself to wake up
And opened my eyes
But the man in the mirror
Was there in disguise
He was playing his part
Living in a trance
Sentenced to be a witness
'Cause he had no defense
The anesthetic is wearing thin
And you're starting to sweat
And you finally realize
That it ain't over yet
'cause the way you've been feeling
They must have hit a nerve
I know it's not what you want
But it's what you deserve
The operation is over
Listen to me please
I'm begging forgiveness
Down on my knees
Coming back to consciousness
I was out of my head
And the dream is over
I'm back in my bed
I have always been here
And I'll always be there
I can honestly tell you
That I really do care
I gotta tell you the truth
About the sadness I find
I have opened my heart to you
And I hope you don't mind",Liar's Nightmare

We'd thought we'd do another show and write another song
But I guess we've lost another one, let it slip away

Breaking all the silver threads that hold you to your dreams
One day they'll fall and you'll fly away

After all the trouble and heartache, we all go out alone

Graham Nash,"Pavanne, Cold steel woman, Pavanne.
How do you love a woman?
With eyes as cold as the barrel of her gun,
Who's never missed her mark on anyone,
Pavanne, Pavanne, Pavanne.

Casino doors swing open, rich men raise their eyes they say 'Who is this beauty'
As elegant as ice, and later there's an accident, another charges d'affaires
Is lying in a pool of blood no witness anywhere.

And they say she was a hundred miles away.
The hotel porter saw her climb the stairs.
And the maid with trembling hands knows what to say.
When the judge says, 'Are you sure?' 'I'm sure,' she swears.

Pavanne, Cold steel woman, Pavanne.
How do you love a woman?
With eyes as cold as the barrel of her gun,
Who's never missed her mark on anyone,
Pavanne, Pavanne, Pavanne.

At the presidential palace a thousand people saw
His excellency leave his car and never make the door.
The blood flow through his fingers as he clutches at the stain
And staggers like a drunken man lies twisted in the rain.

And they say she grew up well provided for.
Her mother used to keep her boys for sure.
And her father's close attentions led to talk.
She learned to stab her food with a silver fork.

Pavanne, Cold steel woman, Pavanne.

And they say she didn't do it for the money.
And they say she didn't do it for a man.
They say she did it for the pleasure.
The pleasure of the moment.

Pavanne, Cold steel woman, Pavanne.
How do you stop this woman?
When everyone is moving through a trance.
Like prisoners of some slow courtly dance.

Graham Nash,"Yeah, yeah, mmm, mmm
I hope you're coming in peace with good intentions
I've got something to say that might save your soul
This sign is a warning so pay attention
Open up the earth you could lose control
This place is full of shit that kills
Maybe us and maybe you, it's true
You can dig for diamonds in the dust
And you can dig forever if you must
But if you dig this mountain free and clear
There's much to fear
Just don't dig here

We considered ourselves a powerful culture
The bully pulpit waved the flag on high
We feasted on the carrion like vultures
Across the land the bones were piling high against the sky
Then we filled the mountain to the brim
Sealed it in, just don't pull the pin
You can dig for diamonds in the dust
And you can dig forever if you must
But if you dig this mountain high and clear
There's much to fear
Just don't dig here

And you can dig for diamonds in the dust
And you can dig forever if you must
But if you dig this mountain high and clear
In the atmosphere
Just don't dig here

Graham Nash,"In times of meditation
I can hear the sweetest voice
Sounding out across the distance
Breaking through the noise

Then there comes a vision
And then a touch so tender
No more indecision
I surrender

I try and keep my heart protected
I try and keep my cool
But just as I suspected
I don't make the rules

I'm giving myself over
No more great pretender
I want to be your lover

Graham Nash,"Driving out through the windmills
And some of them were still
Sometimes it's hard to catch the wind
And bend it to your will

Even though it's hard to know
Just how the story ends
The road is long and it takes its time
On that you can depend

Lay me down in the river
And wash this place away
Break me down like sand from a stone
Maybe I'll be whole again one day

Lay me down, lay me down
Maybe I'll be whole again
Lay me down, lay me down
Maybe I'll be whole again

Somewhere between Heaven and Hell
A soul knows where it's been
I want to feel my spirit lifted up
And catch my breath again

Lay me down in the river
And wash this place away
Break me down like sand from a stone
Maybe I'll be whole again one day

Lay me down, lay me down
Maybe I'll be whole again
Lay me down, lay me down
Maybe I'll be whole again
Lay me down, lay me down
Maybe I'll be whole again one day

Graham Nash,"I can't say we won the war
But I can say we survived
Unlike some of your close friends
Who died standing by your side
Did they serve their Country well?
Fighting in a winless war
Soldiers on both sides can't tell
What it is they're fighting for

What were they dying for?
I guess somebody lied
And families felt the pain
As many mothers cried
And when we bought into the lie
Who was counting up the cost
Underneath a foreign sky
So many lives were lost
Their memory will live on, live on
The wall and all its casualties
Live on, live on
Carved in stone for all to see
Live on, live on
Serve to remind us all
Of the soldiers who have died
And the names upon the wall
Forever carved in stone
The names of those who died
The soldiers on the wall",Live On (The Wall)
Graham Nash,"I can really see the Milky Way tonight
From the furthest edge of memory out of sight
Will the sky begin to fall
No one knows at all, no one knows
I can almost hear the echoes of the past
From the voices of the years gone by so fast
I'm using all my might to try and find the light
In the Milky Way tonight
It seems our hopes and dreams
Were a million miles away
The world's not what it seems
And it's changing every, changing every day

It seems our hopes and dreams
Are a million miles away
The world's not what it seems

I asked this friend of mine what could it be
He told me the tip of the iceberg

Graham Nash,"I come through here quite often
And I think about you
I come through here quite often
And I wonder what you do

A wrong turn at the corner
I could say I got lost
A confusion of memories
Where two streets crossed

The vision I remember
Is eyes through the steam
Coming off the coffee
And rising off the cream

And I don't even know you
And I don't mean to stare
But I know what you're thinking
I can see that you dare to

Care about people
And look into their lives
As you hand them a spoon
As you polish the knives

You reach out and touch one
Every once in a while
With off handed wisdom
Or a lop-sided smile

Now they say don't talk to strangers
I say ""why the hell not""
If you don't talk to strangers
Tell me what have you got?

A world without wisdom
A life without laughs
A season of loneliness
And friendships in half's

Do you care about strangers
And look into their lives
Their sons and their daughters
Their husbands and wives

And I watch your face
To see secret kindness
And watch quiet grace",Through Here Quite Often

I don't think he could beat

'Cause you don't need one
All along the lee shore shells lie scattered in my sin
Winking up like shining eyes at me, from the sea
Here is one like sunrise older than you know
It's still lying there where some careless wave
Forgot it long ago
When I awoke this morning
Dove beneath my floating home
Down below her graceful side
In the turning tide
To watch the sea fish roam
And there I heard a story
From the sailors of the Sandra Marie
There's another isle a days' run away from here
It's empty and free
From here to Venezuela nothing more to see
Than a hundred thousand islands
Flung like jewels upon the sea

To find the difference between something old and something new

And when I sing my song

You could be wrong
Maybe your soul is pleading for a chance to be alone

Will trap us and trip us

That my life lays before me
That yesterday's hero
Never dared to dream
About the stories and tales
All the long hidden memories
That sound like the echoes
Of a tale told between

Between the cracks in the city
Will trap us and trip us
Making us fall to the ground that we love
And through the cracks in the city

Taking us all from below to above

The search for oblivion
Starts out in the daylight
Listening to people
All trying to be first
But dreaming in darkness
Will offer no solace
When all the king's horses

Will my heart behave tonight?

Like a part that just don't work, you're useless so they say
Everything you wear don't fit, your dreams are made of gray
Stay with them and hope they'll turn to something, someday
Don't get wild they've only got you filed down as a problem child

Joints in the noses and joints in the mouth
But the friction in the kitchen only wanted out

That's one man I wouldn't want to be

Questioned them all like they had no balls

Like a stranglehold, way you least expect
Stand right here baby

They fall on stony ground
There’s nothing that they can do
Can do, can do to thaw this soul down

And every kiss enslaves you-oo-oo

Giving an eastern promise, that they could never keep

She heard their hard denials [don't pause]


As the tears dropped sideways down her face, face

I woke up talking in the tongue of a different race, race

And as the flight touches down my watch says 8:02

But that's midnight to you, 

Midnight to you Midight to you
I dreamed headlong collisions in jet lag panavisions

Just like a fool, all double standards baby do this but never do that
Well, forgive him, forgive him, forgive him

He makes her fall, face down into the pillow
Climbing the wall, weeping like a weeping willow
Hands her a tissue he's already used 

Just like a man, just like a man
Dragging her under for everything he'll never be
Ripping her asunder, said he didn't really love her anyway
Well, forgive him, forgive him

The girl isn't ready to do what she wants to do
We think that her boyfriend's like something from a zoo
She thinks that she understands what she's feeling
She's going to leave us make no mistake the wounds won't be healing

Chorus then instrumental over e d e d f#m f#m

The girl isn't ready sure she thinks she is
She walks like a grownup but talks just like a kid
She wants to take on the world and his brother
Next thing you know she'll be telling us that she's a mother

She wants so many things all at once

Verse (chords: g / a / g / a)
Like a brick wall that'll keep her from crumbling
And a camouflage jacket to hide from herself in
And a system of worship like a powerful magnet
That'll draw in the heathens pick them up in a dragnet

She wants so many things get up and run
She wants so many things you're at her beck and call

Verse (chords: g / a / g / a)
Like a blue ocean that's devoid of fishes
Cause they're all on her table prepared into dishes
Like an army of lieutenants all standing to attention
And a book about you where you don't get a mention
With her hand on a Bible she's right in your face
She's a living example of god's bad taste
And with him for an ally she can't be a heretic
But her heart's from a laboratory spun from a synthetic

Bridge (chords: d / a / d / a)

She wants so many things you feel the crunch
She wants so many things don't make her reiterate
She wants so many things all at once


Verse (chords: g / a / g / a)
A collection of clowns who were dragged up in public school
Who dream up the rhythms that she dances in the disco to
They all surround her and yes her to death
With their hands on their mouths to hide their bad breath
And she lives in a fortress at the back of a project
And she'll let you in soon but not now and not yet
And she likes to see you immersed in greed
Confusing what you want with what you need

Bridge (chords: d / a / d / a)
She wants so many things split up into atoms
She owns the crown jewels but you can't get at 'em

Chorus 2 repeat then instrumental verse with doo dooo doos
Then intro repeat

G d a d
She wants so many things you can't keep up with her
G d a g
She wants so many things at the same time
She wants so many things you can't keep it up her
She wants so many things you'll never find

Verse (chords: g / a / g / a)
Like three million shoes and a closet full of whips
And two dozen hats and then everyone fits
And the kind of acceptance that needs a lobotomy
That'll help you accept every single contradictory
Statement that hits you like a force nine gale
And makes you go pale every time that you fail
To bring home the bacon and bring in the goods
Get the musk from the deer and the shell from the turtle
And the gold from the fools and the shells from the sea
She says load them in a caravan bring them to me

Bridge (chords: d / a / d / a)
She wants so many things brought to her feet
Cover every inch of the world in concrete
You better do it it's only your fate
She can't wait any longer don't make her wait

G d a d
She wants so many things you can't give to her
G d a g
She wants so many things you don't have much
She wants so many things you can't deliver to her
Everything's attached to strings you can't touch
(fade on) she wants so many things /pre>
",She Wants So Many Things
Graham Parker,"Have you seen her run through the wild things?
Dropping behind her the child's things that she'll no longer need
Scattering like seeds they are discarded then
Nothing can give them a life again
They're comfort only when she bleeds

And strong winds are blowing through her hair
I reach out to touch it, but it's not there
Strong winds are beating at her door
Even with it locked, they come back stronger than before

And when she takes a walk into the early morning
Somewhere inside you, an early warning bell begins to ring
And in the darkest night she takes a telescope
Looks through the wrong end and loses hope
Pointing at the nearest thing

And strong winds are blowing through her hair
I reach out to touch it, but it's not there
Strong winds are beating down our door
Shaping our lives, we never know what for

And when she takes her place in the furniture
The crystal vase and the rocking chair
The chintz and China cups
Then it's all reduced to a bill of sale
She disappears with the merchandise
You understand that well

And strong winds are blowing through her hair
I reach out to touch it, but it's not there
Strong winds are beating at her door
Even with it locked, they come back stronger than before

Stronger than before repeated
Stronger than before repeated
Stronger than before repeated

It's not right the way that you deal with her
She's not something you handle like cash
To be undressed like Sunday's leftovers
G d g
To be picked on Monday and Tuesday in the trash
D g
That's where she ends up

It's not right the way that you don't listen
She's not something you hang on a wall
To be moved at the earliest convenience
Well you say that you love her
You don't love her at all you don't love her at all

One day you'll look round and she won't be there
G d see
She'll disappear in front of your face

She'll walk over you as if you weren't there

You never really were there anyway (instrumental verse)

You can buy her a slice of the good life
But you're buying time that's all
One day she'll pull out the big knife
Well you say that you love her
You don't love her at all you don't love her at all

One day she'll get wise and drop the big one
And disappear in front of your face

When I was king I was not really the man I am now
G am g see
I was like anyone sitting on a throne made out of china
G g see em
When I was king I had already abdicated
See am g see
Already melted my crown down to sell as scrap
See
But they'd run the first run of stamps
D g
People had cashed in their post office savings
See d see
To buy some and lick the back of my neck
(c) d
I just let them get on with it arrange the coronation
G see
I just didn't turn up, I just didn't turn up

You became queen to a regime of fixed ideas
The subjects just outlines like figures in a shadow cabinet
And then we ruled over some green and pleasant land
With a frog and a princess not necessarily in that order

But if you want it to be what you want it to be
You'll have to dethrone me or have me decapitated
I didn't want to be king anyway I always preferred to hang out
With the servants, the servants
When I was king
When I was king there was no country left to rule
Jesters and fools were leaders all of them a royal pain
Now I'm a serf but I'm still trying to be a king
But putting the crown on is like putting a silk purse on a sow's ear
And if I want it to be like I want it to be
I'll have to assassinate someone with a guitar as a gun
On it's good to be king I know that I've been there

Many, many, many, many kingdoms ago when I was king

",When I Was King
Graham Parker,"Let's talk about a criminal procedure 
Throw out the idea of illegal seizure
Put a rope around somebody's neck 
Let's hold some bastard up for example
Take his blood and a urine sample 
Feed him garbage and make him pick up the check

[Chorus]
Well, here it comes here it comes, here it, 
Here, here, here it comes again (twice)

While you were sleeping the neighbors crept in 
Saw you were naked and called it a sin

The next thing you know... it's the next thing you know
Men they poked their heads in your kitchen door 
Smelt something burning and they were sure
It must be the flag you were burning that's what they swore

[Chorus repeat]
They tell you the preacher was hypocritical
What they don't tell you is that he's typical
What he stands for is totally mythical
And as they lead him away he'll pray for you brother
With a bible in one hand and playboy in the other
Imagine what he does to his mother

[Chorus repeat]
They tell you they want to give the right to life
To millions of jerks who will live by the knife
Who'll beat up their children and beat up their wives
Now don't write poetry it's an offense 
Unless it falls to the right of the fence

You'll wind up a victim of zero tolerance 
Let's hold some bastard up for example
Take his blood and a urine sample 
Remind him that man belongs down a man hole (three times) and then 
Ah yeah, get on down.",Here It Comes Again
Graham Parker,"We work through the rituals and cover our poisonous tracks
Making good use of weaknesses, horoscopes, rumors and facts
Inspired by the needles and pins and the pains in the heart
With no control over the chemistry that brings us then tears us apart

Now we're as hard, as hard as nails
Laugh at the butterfly that's just been impaled
We're always running and don't know what we're running from
We're always sweating bricks
The only time the world makes sense to us is when we come
Love is a burning, love is a burninglove is a burning question
On the tip of your tongue, baby baby

I'll endlessly make you and endlessly become remade
I'll endlessly search for your heart with a carnal switchblade,
As we thrash in the heat in an effort to beat up the world
Then we loose our identities replace them with diamonds and pearls

Don't be as hard as hard as nails
You might be born to win and then your heart fails
Get on my wavelength understand my driving force

It's sin and sin alone
I wouldn't lie to you unless I had to of course
Love is a burning, love is a burninglove is a burning question

Don't answer no
Don't make me take a look just let me off the hook
I've seen the future of rock and it sucks, yeah, it sucks

I've used you you're bleeding I know but don't be afraid
It's only a wound only a wound from a carnal switchblade
We're always running and don't know what we're running from
We're always so convinced
But the more we run the more it just slips through our fingertips

Love is a burning, love is a burninglove is a burning question

Graham Parker,"I am a lucky man that's what I think
I might come close to the edge but I never sink
And I notice that vulnerable look in your eyes tonight
And in the desert that passes for my heart, Sweet rain is falling tonight
You're my oasis, You're my Oasis, Oasis
Be my oasis and I will try not to be your mirage

I must be choked with emotion, I can't find the right words to say
I'm not a pillar of devotion, but don't let that stand in your way
And as the sun sinks blood red in the west it reminds me of your bleeding heart 
and as I lay down my head on your breast Nothing can tear us apart
'Cause you're my oasis, you're my oasis
Be my oasis and I won't be your mirage

'Cause I am a lucky man, yeah that's what i think
I might be swimming for my life but I'll never sink
And as the quicksand comes up to my neck and holds me down like a grave
I will reach out for your hand and as I touch it I'm saved by an oasis

You're my Oasis, Oasis
Be my oasis and I will try not to be your mirage
And I won't be your mirage",Oasis
Graham Parker,"Na na nah

I can still feel your teethmarks in my neck your footprints on my back
And the gris gris you sprinkled in my bed is starting to make me crack

I can still hear your twang ringing in my ears, your perfume I still smell
You bought it way down below the mason dixon line
Like your mother you're a southern belle

I said release me, but please don't let me know
I said release me, but please don't let me go

Ah my blood's still boiling, like a snake you come coiling
Ready to strike

When the night comes down I get a big black fear,
Like the clouds hanging up above
I don't want you to possess me, but that's how it is
I ain't nothin' but your slave of love.

I said release me, but please don't let me know
Release me, but please don't let me oh oh oh

Release me, but please don't let me know
Release me, but please don't let me go

Release me release me baby, release me release me yeah",Release Me
Graham Parker,"If I had the slightest clue as to what you are and what's inside you
I would know exactly what to do and be worthy of your love

If a flower bloomed in the frozen wastes and the moon had a smiling face
And the stars had not a hint of grace I'd be worthy of your love

I would be there when you're sad and lonely
I would not care if I sacrificed the only
Life I had, I'd give it up as if it were nothing

If I had what I haven't got, a second chance a second shot
I'd be something that I'm not, I'd be worthy of your love

I'd be there inside of every moment
I would know how every moment is a moment lost
Unless it's lived as if it's loved

If I could make up all the rules I would not carry out the work of fools
Or use deception and fear as tools and I'd be worthy of your love
I'd be worthy of your love
",Worthy of Your Love
Graham Parker,"There's a man in my suitcase, a woman in your clothes
Skeletons inside us that dance on hot coals
Cannibals are outside following our trail
All our information comes from junk mail

Don't leave it among us, don't let it loose in the crowd
Don't let it reign over us, 'cause that was yesterday's cloud
Still hanging over us

There's an elephant of memory, a monkey on a back
A poisonous whirlpool, swirling and black
I know we have tasted the fobidden ugly fruit
Get it out of our system rip it by the root

Chorus repeat

The rain came out of nowhere, a bad flashback
Someone hit the switch and the sky turned black
Why is this happening, why won't it go away?
If this is a game I don't wann play

You were standing underneath the light I lost my heart, it felt all right

And it shook me, and I'm still shaking now.

I remember rainy nights I thought I'd drown
Was it london new york paris or amsterdam
I forget the details no I must admit but you were there through all of it
And it shook me, and I'm still shaking now.

Repeat chorus (then) instrumental verse (ends with em / d twice)

Will you hold on and hope our grip don't fail
Sometimes lovers hammer in their own coffin nails
I just read how universes start, continually they blow apart
And it shook me and I'm still shaking now.

Some believe in a heaven up above
With a God that forgives all with his great love
Well I forgive you if you forgive me, hey! who needs the third party anyway
And it shook me and I'm still shaking now.
