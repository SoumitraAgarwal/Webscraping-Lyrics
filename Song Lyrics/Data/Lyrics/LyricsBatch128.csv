Frankie Laine,"Carry me back to old Virginny,
There's where the cotton and the corn and tatoes grow,
There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime,
There's where the old darke'ys heart am long'd to go,
There's where I labored so hard for old massa,
Day after day in the field of yellow corn,
No place on earth do I love more sincerely
Than old Virginny, the state where I was born. 

Carry me back to old Virginny,
There's where the cotton and the corn and tatoes grow,
There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime,
There's where this old darkey's heart am long'd to go. 

Carry me back to old Virginny,
There let me live 'till I wither and decay,
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered,
There's where this old darke'ys life will pass away.
Massa and missis have long gone before me,
Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore,
There we'll be happy and free from all sorrow,
There's where we'll meet and we'll never part no more.",Carry Me Back to Old Virginny
Frankie Laine,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.",Oh Lady Be Good

Frankie Laine,"Hey good looking.
Hey good looking what you got cooking
How's about cooking something up for me
Hey sweet baby don't you think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe

I got a brand new car and a ten dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill
The juke box's jumping the dance is free
So if you want to have fun come along with me

Hey good looking what you got cooking
How's about cooking something up for me

I'm free and ready so we can go steady
How's about saving all your time for me
No more looking, I know I've been cooking
How's about keeping steady company

I'm gonna pull my date book over the fence
And find me one for five or ten cents
I'll keep it 'til it's covered with age

On this, our weddin' day
Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'

I only know I must be brave
And I must face a man who hates me
Or lie a coward, a craven coward
Or lie a coward in my grave

Oh, to be torn 'tweenst love and duty
Supposin' I lose my fair-haired beauty
Look at that big hand move along
Nearin' high noon

He made a vow while in state prison
Vowed it would be my life or his, and
I'm not afraid of death, but, oh
What shall I do if you leave me?

Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
You made that promise as a bride
Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'

Frankie Laine,"There is a lonely train called the 3.10 to Yuma
The pounding of the wheels is more like a mournful sigh
There's a legend and there's a rumor
When you take the 3.10 to Yuma
You can see the ghosts of outlaws go ridin' by (Ridin' by)
In the sky (In the sky), way up high
The buzzards keep circlin' the train
While below the cattle are thirstin' for rain

It's also true they say on the 3.10 to Yuma
A man may meet his fate
For fate travels ev'rywhere
Though you've got no reason to go there
And there ain't a soul that you know there
When the 3.10 to Yuma whistles its sad refrain
Take that train (Take that train)
Take that train

So when you take the train called the 3.10 to Yuma
And leave the things you love
You leave with a silent prayer (Silent prayer)

Frankie Laine,"Jealousy, night and day you torture me
I sometimes wonder
If this spell that I'm under
Can only be a melody
For I know no one but me has won your heart, but
When the music starts, my peace departs

From the moment they play that lovely strain
And we surrender to all its charm again
This jealousy that tortures me is ecstasy, mystery, pain

We dance to a tango of love
Your heart beats with mine as we sway
Your eyes give the answer I'm dreaming of
That soft word your cruel lips will never say

I fear that the music will end
And shatter the spell it may lend
To make me believe when your eyes just deceive
But it's only the tango you love

That's where I saw my love 
The girl with the golden hair
Not a word between us was spoken
No the silence never was broken 
But before she left her eyes said a sad goodbye
Sad am I sad am I 
To think of the chance that I missed
I could cry to think of the lips left unkissed

Perhaps she'll ride again on the 3.10 to yuma
And I can meet my love and tell her how much I care
Though I have no reason to go there

Frankie Laine,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o
Ghost herd in the sky
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o
Ghost riders in the sky
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
They've got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' flame an' fire, as they ride on, hear them cry
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o
Ghost riders in the sky
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
""If you want to save your soul from hell a' ridin' on our range""

Played a little the poker the time had passed me by  
Shoes in my hand and my darlin' wife in bed
Up the stairs sayin' a prayer
Then a voice comes through the air

Hi there daddy remember what you said
Tell me a story tell me a story
Tell me how your eyes are glassed
Because it's only if your bad
Tell me a story then I'll go to bed

Once a upon a time I remember long ago
Don't go back in years through your memories kinda slow
Stop your noisy talkin' till I've finished with ma tale
Once upon
Upon a what
Upon your back you'll get a swat

Frankie Laine,"Your eyes are the eyes of a woman in love
And though how they give you away
Why try to deny your a woman in love
When I know very well would I see 
I see no moon in the sky
Ever lent such a glow
Some flame deep within made them shine

Those eyes are the eyes of a woman in love
And may they gaze ever more into mine
Crazily gaze ever more into mine

Frankie Laine,"Granada, I'm falling under your spell,
And if you could speak, what a fascinating tale you would tell.
Of an age the world has long forgotten.
Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today.

The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada,
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada.
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wanderr along.
Entranced by the beauty before me,
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song.

And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada,
I envy the blush of the snow-clad Sierra Nevada.
For soon it will welcome the stars while a thousand guitars,
Play a soft habanera.
Then moonlit Granada will live again the glory of yesterday,

Kisses I could almost taste in the night
Wondered why I'm not the guy who's silhouette's on the shade
I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...

Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore
Let me in or else I'll beat down your door
When two strangers who have been two silhouettes on the shade
oh what a shock ""you're on the wrong block""

Rushed out to your house with wings on my feet
Loved you like I'd never loved you, my sweet

Frankie Masters,"I once had a gown it was almost new, oh, the daintiest
Thing, it was sweet Alice blue; with little forgetmenots
Placed here and there, when I had it on, I walked on the air,
And it wore, and it wore, and it wore, till it went and it
Wasn't no more.

In my sweet little Alice blue gown
When I first wandered down in to town
I was both proud and shy, as I felt every eye, but in every shop
Window
I'd primp, passing by;

Then in manner of fashion I'd frown
And the world seemed to smile all around
Till it wilted I wore it, I'll always adore it, my sweet little
Alice blue gown",Alice Blue Gown

Her heart is like a fortress.
She clings to her silence like a lover.
She wishes you were cold and heartless
So she wouldn't...
Wouldn't have to... feel.
Oh and when she lifts her head,
And your eyes meet,
She walks to your effortless,
With suffocating grace.
And you're caught up in the moment
And someone speaks,
And whisks it all away.

But this moment never ends,
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends.
This moment never ends.

I've loved her forever, and in my dreams,
When the evening meets morning,
We're riding bareback moonbeams.
She belongs to different spaces.
She belongs to different times.

And this moment never ends,
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends,
This moment never ends.

At these moments it was clear,
It's taken all my life... to get here.
Se waits for me at
The door way while I draw her pictures
Of my perfect world ...

And this moment never ends
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends,
This moment never ends.

Frankie Miller,"I'll tell you a story about a night in the town
It started off drinking and fighting.
By the time a was through, 
I'd near worn out my shoes, 

I had visited every known dive.
All the lights in the alley, 
Fall dim on the ground, When your trying to see your
Way home.
And the all night ladies, 
In their perfume so fine, 
Wont leave a poor boy alone.

Well the paths of the gambler
Are kneeded too thin, 
When the cards are all spread on the floor.
The six and the seven, 
I needed to win, 

And you can't call the bluff any more.
So you stand to your feet, 
And you figure discretely, 
The best way to pay what you owe.
And she hands you a line, 
Tells you thanks for the time, 

'You might have brought brains to the show.'

Chorus:
Drunken nights on the city, 
Are showing their toes, 
They'll take you for all that you owe.
You can't judge a book, 
And you can't judge a crook, 
Down where the men, they can't go.
 
By early the next morning, 
I rose up to tight, 
My eyes were as red as the light.
My pockets were empty, 
And so was my heart, 
And I promised to put things right.
So I went to the preacher, 
I fell on my knees, 
I asked the preacher, 

To right all my wrongs, 
But he just shook his head, 

And looked sorry when he said, 

'You've been on the drink far too long'",Drunken Nights in the City
Frankie Miller,"Just say goodbye
Touch me deep inside
Baby, I hope it's not a farewell
You can count on me
When it's a friend you need
All the same
I hope it all goes well

Now be good to yourself
Everyday and every night
Pick yourself a girl 
Who can begin, to treat you right

Tell the truth to one another
Till your dying day
May the sun, shine down your way

You know the times we had
Been far from bad
And I hope we come together
Once again
But until that time
We just say goodbye
I'll remember you till the very end

Everyday and every night
Pick yourself a girl 
Who can begin, to treat you right

To someone who can show the way complete

Ya no le importaba solo soy agua pasada
Si el orgullo a veces traiciona, me engañe 
Que no la amaba, hoy mi mente me pide que corra 
Tras  de ella pues me muero por amarla
Ya no le importaba solo soy agua pasada
Agua que va pasando por el rio sin evitar 
Ir al  vacío, así se siente mi mente, por un vacío en mi alma
Ya no le importaba solo soy agua pasada

Quisiera, quisiera decirle que la amo, 
Que mi corazón nunca la ha olvidado, no quiero 
Aceptar que se ha ido, que por mi tonto orgullo se ha marchado
Ya no le importaba solo soy agua pasada
Solo soy agua pasada, solo soy agua pasada,agua

Ah caray!
Dios mio veme te lo pido, dame ya otra oportunidad, 
Que la regreses conmigo me muero por ella, 
Este borícua si la va a amar",Agua Pasada

Algo extraño entre los dos

Me sorprendió tu bonita inocencia

Sera, sera como tu quieras pero así sera
Si aun tengo que esperarte siete vidas mas
Me quedare colgado de este sentimiento

Por amarte así
Es esa mi fortuna, es ese mi castigo
Sera que tanto amor acaso esta prohibido

Así voy caminando en esta cuerda floja

Contando los segundos que faltan por verte
Haciéndote culpable de mi propia suerte
Soñando hasta despierto por hacerte mía

Frankie Negron,"Esta noche tengo ganas de salir para encontrar
Un lugar donde a la penas no se les permita entrar
Y escapar por un momento y sentarme a conversar
Con la voz de un sentimiento que no puedo controlar

Están noche es la perfecta para sentarme a escribir
Esa carta que seguro nunca vas a recibir
Y decirte que te extraño, que fue lindo nuestro amor
Y a pesar de que estas lejos te deseo lo mejor
Y es que ésta noche

Mi corazón te necesita como nunca imaginé
Y es que ésta noche
Suplicaría de rodillas que volvieras otra vez
Y daría cualquier cosa , hasta el alma si es preciso

Por un beso de tu boca
Por un beso de tu boca amor

Esta noche tengo ganas de volver a revivir
El susurro de tus ojos tu manera de reír
Tus defectos  tus virtudes y ésa forma de querer
Que te hacían tan distinta a cualquier otra mujer

Esta noche se hace corta para ponerme a mirar
Ésa foto desgastada que aun conservo en su lugar
Donde estabas tan contenta abrazada junto a mi
Cuando yo no imaginaba el poder vivir sin ti

Y es que ésta noche
Mi corazón te necesita como nunca imaginé
Y es que ésta noche
Suplicaría de rodillas que volvieras otra vez
Y daría cualquier cosa , hasta el alma si es preciso

Sin condiciones, ni lamentos why tropiezos
Si, volver a internar, why revivir mi sueño
A su fuego why sentimiento, a su amor

Tu lo entenderas, se nos acabo el tiempo
No quiero verte mas llorar
Dejemos de sufrir why actuar
No vale la pena lastimar

Lo que el tiempo quiere recordar
No quiero verte mas llorar
Tus lagrimas sofocaran
El intento de mi libertad

La oportunidad de empezar
Que no sea esto un cruel final
Se que nos dolera
Why tambien que se ira, deprisa

El triste adios junto al frio why mal recuerdo

Frankie Negron,"Amanecer contigo
Después de habernos amado
Es como haber alcanzado
Un pedazo de cielo donde nadie ha llegado

Amanecer contigo
Y disfrutar el silencio
Viendo tus ojos serenos
Deseando tus labios que me invitan a un beso

Amanecer contigo
Es contemplar un ángel en mi cama
Amanecer contigo
Es ver la luz del sol en tu mirada
Es como renacer
Sentir sobre la piel
La sensación más bella y mas humana

Amanecer contigo
Todos los días del año
Y cada vez celebrarlo
Como si fuera siempre
Día de enamorados

Amanecer contigo

Princesa de mis amores
Por tu placer que no haría
Fue, fue inolvidable la noche
Fue un remolino de caricias
Oye nena
Por ti, hoy me he vuelto a enamorar
Y quiero comerte a besos
Así, sin apuro, lento, lento
Y darte felicidad

Porque en cada sitio que esté
En las cosas que vives yo también viviré

Porque en cada sitio que estés

Uno en brazos del otro

Bajo el mismo cielo
Y aunque todo cambie
No nos perderemos

Te lleve con mi corazón

Frankie Randall,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You
Frankie Randall,"Our waltz is music fashioned in heaven,
Angels composed it for us to dance to.
Our waltz is moonlight trembling with kisses,
Each note a heartbeat throbbing with love.

Angels were watching one day,
And our love was their inspiration!

Our love is Springtime filled with a promise,
Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone
Our waltz will play on.

Frankie Randall,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Frankie Randall,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All

You came along and everything's startin' to hum

I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

For the sake of havin' you near

Frankie Randall,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before

Frankie Randall,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Frankie Ruiz,"Tu adiós como una fría madrugada 
Dejó la soledad aquí en mi almohada 
Después que te ofrecí todas mis noches 
Dejé que te marcharas sin reproches

No quisé detenerte con mi llanto 
Mi orgullo de varón logró evitarlo 
Y solo me quedó el sabor amargo 
De tu espacio vacío entre mis brazos

Si no te hubieras ido
Si no te hubieras ido 
No existiría un recuerdo 
En busca de un olvido

Si no te hubieras ido
Si no te hubieras ido

Tanto como te amaba y te fuiste de mí 
Traté de detenerte y mi orgullo lo evito mi amor

Noche y madrugada entera 
Y mi amor aumenta mas

Porque pienso en ella en el camino 
Imaginando su cariñito 
Y todo el bien que ella da

La nostalgia viene a hablar conmigo 
Con el radio yo consigo 
Espantar la soledad

Voy de día un poco
Mas veloz de noche prendo los faroles 
Para iluminar la oscuridad

Yo se, voy corriendo en busca de ella 
Corazón tan disparado 
Pero yo voy con cuidado 
No me arriesgo en marcha suelta

Yo se, siempre en esa carretera 
Al volante pienso en ella 
Ya pinte en mi parachoques un corazón 
Y el nombre de ella

Ya rodé por mi país entero 
Como todo camionero
Tuve lluvia y cerrazón

Cuando llueve el limpiador desliza 
Va y viene el parabrisas late igual mi corazón. 
Loco por lo dulce de sus besos 
Miro lleno de deseos 
Su retrato en el panel

Es en el calor de su abrazo 
Que me olvido del cansancio 
Y me abastezco de su miel

Yo se
Cada día por la carretera 
Noche y madrugada entera 
Y mi amor aumenta mas

Meto la directa y siento el viento 
Voy con dios y voy contento 
Mi camino sigue en paz

A tu forma de besar y al calor de tu mirada

Me acostumbré a dejarme transportar
A ese mundo donde tú con dulzura me llevabas

Y ahora ya la costumbre vive en mí
No podré sobrevivir si algún día me faltarás
Porque eres tú la culpable de que  yo
A tus cosas y ese amor sin querer me acostumbrará

Me acostumbré a rendirme a ese placer
De formar un solo ser como un loco enamorado
Me acostumbré al pecado sin perdón
De entregarte mi pasión y olvidar que soy casado

Y ahora ya la costumbre vive en mí
No podré sobrevivir si algún día me faltarás
Porque eres tú la culpable de que yo
A tus cosas y ese amor sin querer me acostumbrará
A tus cosas y ese amor sin querer me acostumbrará

Me acostumbre a rendirme a tu placer

Al perfume de tu piel y al calor de tu mirada
A ternuras que jamás con más nadie compartí te digo a ti
Me acostumbraste a tu cuerpo a tus cosas y a tu amor

Si algún día me faltaras no podré sobrevivir te digo a ti
Como un loco enamorado siempre me tienes pensando
La culpa la tienes tu de que yo me acostumbrará

Cuando estoy a tu lado
el mundo gira distinto 
le robo un beso a la luna 
es como volar a otro universo

Tomándote de la mano 
siento vibrar tu emoción 
poco a poco te desvisto 
y brilla tu cuerpo en la habitación

Aquí estamos tu y yo
abrazados a este amor 
que crece cada día mas
como un volcán que va a estallar

Mas allá de la piel
he aprendido a conocerte 
en un gesto, una mirada
puedo ver tu corazón

Mas allá de la piel
desafiamos las fronteras 
damos vida al sentimiento, en una entrega total 
nace un mundo fabricado por los dos

Ahí vaya mi china 

Cuando regresa la calma
todo es completa armonía 
y entre tus cabellos 
y sobre tu pecho comienzo a soñar

Contemplo en cada detalle
que forma parte de tí 
descubro cosas nuevas
que te hacen más bella 
por darme tu amor

Frankie Ruiz,"No se da ni cuenta que cuando la miro por no delatarme
Me guardo un suspiro que mi amor callado
Se enciende con verla que diera la vida para poseerla

No se da ni cuenta que brillan mis ojos
Que tiemblo a su lado y hasta me sonrojo
Que ella es el motivo que a mi amor despierta
Que ella es mi delirio y no se da ni cuenta

Esta cobardía de mi amor por ella hace que
La vea igual que a una estrella tan lejos
Tan lejos en la inmensidad, que no espero nunca
Poderla alcanzar

Esta cobardía de mi amor por ella hace que
La vea igual que a una estrella tan lejos
Tan lejos en la inmensidad, que no espero nunca
Poderla alcanzar

No se da ni cuenta que le he concedido
Los cálidos besos que no me ha pedido
Que en mis noches tristes desiertas de sueño
De loco deseo, me siento su dueño

No se da ni cuenta que ya la he gozado
Porque ha sido mí sin haberla amado
Que es su alma fría la que me atormenta
Que ve que me muero y no se da ni cuenta

Esta cobardía de mi amor por ella hace que
La vea igual que a una estrella tan lejos
Tan lejos en la inmensidad, que no espero nunca
Poderla alcanzar

Esta cobardía de mi amor por ella hace que
La vea igual que a una estrella tan lejos
Tan lejos en la inmensidad, que no espero nunca
Poderla alcanzar

Frankie Ruiz,"Anda why ve, té esta esperando, anda why ve
No lo hagas por mí, que a fin el cabo somos solo amigos
Anda why ve, te veo nerviosa, anda why ve
Why que sientes con él, lo que en su día tu sentías conmigo

Pero lo dudo
Conmigo té mesías en el aire
Volabas en caballo blanco en mundo
Why esas cosas no podrán volver

why es que lo dudo
Porque hasta a veces me has llorado por un beso
Llorando de alegría why no de miedo
Why lo dudo té que te pase igual con él, igual con él

Anda why ve, entregale
Todo el amor que un día mío fue
Todo lo que te enseñe puedes gozarlo ha su lado
Pero no pienses en mi es un punto ya pasado why olvidado

Yo no te prometi nada que no pudiera cumplir
Te ensene lo que es carino te ensene lo que es vivir pero hasta ahi
Me has llorado por un beso suplicando mis caricias
Asi yo te espero ver parada en la misma esquina mi china

Tu rodaras, por que ese es tu destino
Sin encontrar, nadie que te detenga.

Quise pararte, pero ibas sin frenos
Y tus rodadas me hicieron pedazos
Por que no quieres, los caminos buenos
Y agarras todo lo que hay en tus pasos.

Yo que soñaba, con ser en tu vida
El terminar, de tus vueltas al mundo
Te vi. pasar, como una ave perdida
De aquí pa allá, sin agarra tu mundo

Ninguna rueda, me había lastimado
Y me pasaron de las mas pesadas
Pero contigo, quede destrozado
Por que no hiciste ninguna parada.


Yo que te tenia, siempre a mi lado,
Y el día menos pensado, tú te me fuiste de mi lado.

Pero ay, que barbaridad, y yo sin moverme del mismo lugar.

Pero ay, que barbaridad, y yo sin moverme del mismo lugar.

Yo que a ti te daba, todita mi lana,
No supiste apreciar, y seguiste con tus rodadas.

Pasas encima de mí, buscando tu destino.

Pero ay, que barbaridad, y yo sin moverme del mismo lugar.

Aun me deseas con la misma intensidad
Conque rodabamos amandonos el la yerba
Cuando yo apenas comensaba la universidad

Tu me desias no se como pero pronto e de lograr
En el dinero viajes, lujos why un carro para pasiar
Why te encontrastes la oculensia

En ese hombre que te da
Porque deseas mas no llena
Lo que yo si se llenar

En ese que te brinda estabilidad economica
Why siempre te complase en tus caprichos materiales
Why yo que e saboriado cada pliege de tu intimidad

Soy eterno fuego tu fantasia
Soy el que motiva tus escapes cada dia
Esto es un peligro pero es divino
Es que en el peligro esta el sabor de lo proibido
Este amor que cresio por la necesidad
Que sasiar lo que el dinero no puede llenar

Mira que ironica es la vida
Hoy nueva mente juntos aqui en el mismo motel
Donde rompimos beso a beso la innocensia
Cuando la cama se empapo de tu nines

Tus ambisiones vinos finos why restaurantes
Mis illusiones subir alto why alcanzar lo que sone
Es ebidente as progresado ahora ueles a carter
Mas tu riquesa no a llenado el vacio que deje

Soy eterno fuego tu fantasia
Soy el que motiva tus escapes cada dia
Esto es un peligro pero es divino
Es que en el peligro esta el sabor de lo proibido
Este amor que cresio por la necesidad
Que sasiar lo que el dinero no puede llenar

Oye mamita te fuistes con ese que tiene dinero
Mas sin embargo el papito rico ese soy yo

No me mires con esos ojos de aventura
No me trates como si fuera diversión
No te muevas de esa manera cuando pasas
Que me dejas con una extraña sensación

No sugieras extravagancias con tu risa
No me ciegues la gloria en cada movimiento
Que tu juego me mortifica
Y la vida se me complica
Y no quieras saber las cosas que yo invento

Pues me vuelves loco
Tú me vuelves loco
Cuando yo te miro china
Pero no te toco

Y me vuelves loco
Tú me vuelves loco
Ay, si yo pudiera mama
Aunque fuera un poco

No camines con ese paso que provoca
No te sientes en esa pose tan sensual
Y no bailes de esa manera
Que bailando me desesperas
Y me lleno de tanto bien que me hace mal

Pues me vuelves loco
Tú me vuelves loco
Cuando yo te miro china
Pero no te toco

Y me vuelves loco

Me vuelves loco corazón

Te miro pero no te toco
Si yo pudiera aunque sea un poco
Me paro en la esquina y
Te veo pasar una extraña sensación me da

Me haces tanto bien que me hace mal

Sin movimientos y medio loco

I have visions of many things

Some kind of piece of mind, maybe

If roots of love grow all around
But for me they come tumblin' down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hopin' and prayin' for someone to care
Always movin' and goin' nowhere

I can remember loving caresses showered on me.
Mother's eyes would gaze at me so tender,
What was their meaning? Now I can see.

One bright and guiding light,
That taught me wrong from right,
I found in my mother's eyes.
Those baby tales she told,
That road all paved in gold,
I found in my mother's eyes.

Just like a wandering sparrow,
One lonely soul.
I walked the straight and narrow,
To reach my goal.
God's gift sent from above,
A real unselfish love,
I found in my mother's eyes.

When I'm all alone, no one around me,
I find the future dark as can be.
Sorrows I have known, always surround me,
Then through the shadows, I always see.

That taught me wrong from right,

Is to share and to feel

Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

And if my song can start you laughing
I'm happy, happy

Let me sing a sad refrain
Of broken hearts who love in vain
And if my song can start you crying
I'm happy

Let me croon a lowdown blues
That lifts you out of your seat
If my blues can reach your shoes
And start you tapping your feet

Crawl out of the night
Hoping the daylight will never come
For you and I

Keep your heart open and your eyes shut tight
What will be, will be
Keep your heart open and your eyes shut tight
But don't forget about me

I wake up
With my eyes shut tight
Hoping tomorrow will never come

Frankie Yankovic,"I wondered alone one night. 
Till I heard an orchestra play.
I met you when lights were bright,
and people were carefree and gay.
You were the beautiful lady in blue.
I was in Heaven just dancing with you.
You filled me with strange delight,
and softly you strolled away.
 
I dream of that night with you,
lady when first we met.
We danced in a world of blue.
How can my heart forget.
Blue were your eyes,
and blue were the skies.
Just like the blue skirt you wore.
Come back blue lady come back.
Don't be blue anymore.",Blue Skirt Waltz
Frankie Yankovic,"Beer from Milwaukee
The very best in town
It makes you so talky
Drink it down, drink it down, drink it down

A toast to Milwaukee
so raise your glasses high
And you'll chugalug until your dry
and raise your spirits to the sky

Beer from Milwaukee
The very best in town
Just don't be so talky
Buy a round, buy a round, buy a round

And drink to Milwaukee

and raise your spirits to the sky

Frankie Yankovic,"This is the strip polka
I adore this ?

There's a burlesque theater where the gang loves to go
To see queenie the cutie of the burlesque show
And the thrill of the evening is when out queenie skips
And the band plays the polka while she strips

""Take it off, take it off"", cries a voice from the rear
""Take it off, take it off"", soon it's all you can hear
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops and always just in time

She's as fresh and as wholesome as the flowers in May
And she hopes to retire to the farm someday
But you can't buy a farm until you're up in the chips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

""Take it off, take it off"", all the customers shout
""Down in front, down in front"", while the band beats it out
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops and always just in time

Queenie, queen of them all
Queenie, someday you'll fall
Someday church bells will chime
In strip polka time

Oh, she hates corny waltzes and she hates the gavotte
And there's one big advantage if the music's hot
It's a fast moving exit just in case something rips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

Drop around, take it in, it's the best in the west
""Take it off, take it off, take it off"", you can yell like the rest
Take her out when it's over, she's a peach when she's dressed
But she stops and always just in time, time, time

Queenie, queen of them all
Queenie, someday you'll fall
Someday church bells will chime
In strip polka time",Strip Polka
Frankie Yankovic,"You're my girl the boys all know, you're my girl, I've told them so.
You should have seen how their faces fell when they were wishing me well.
They called me a lucky guy, and I couldn't hide a feeling of pride.
You're my girl, I've chosen you to be mine, my whole life through.
And if this heart of mine had a voice, you'd hear it second my choice,
You're what I've waited for, and you're my girl.

The kids that see me come to call have written your name and my name on the wall.

It's common gossip everywhere, that you and I have got it bad for fair.
You're my girl, I've chosen you to be mine my whole life through,

As I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you

My only sunshine
You make me happy
When skies are grey

Please, don't take my sunshine away

You'll regret it all someday

I can't help myself I love you and nobody else

I'm tied to your apron strings and there's nothing I can do

Sugar pie honey bunch I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself I'm a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you tell you that we're through and I've tried
But every time I see your face I get all choked up inside

When I call your name girl it starts the flame burning in my heart
tearin it all apart no matter how I try my love
I cannot hide 'cause

To songs that make your heart so sore
Maybe I should write one more

When you won't just bring me back one time
To hide so many truths
Then run from me and back to him
And leave me like this fool

A fraud of love, that's all you were
For you are an emptiness
A person who seems to be void

Du bist mein strahlender Stern, im Herz
Ich hab dich in meinem Herz bin ich auch noch so weit entfernt
Du bist mein strahlender Stern, im Herz
Hohoh

Es gab einmal vor langer Zeit, Jahre bevor du geboren wurdest
Zwei Menschen, die sich liebten und sie waren bereit
Alles zu geben, sich ihr Leben zu teilen
Und sie schworen sie werdens schaffen und sind irgendwann frei
Sie hatten Träume zu verwirklichen
Zu viele Träume, die nicht wirklich sind
Weil seine Eltern deutsch und ihre türkisch sind
Doch es gab nichts, dass sie mehr fürchtete
Und nichts, dass für ihn härter wäre, als wenn das Feuer in ihrem Herz erlischt
Sie nahm die Knete aus der Jacke von ihrem Daddy
Keiner wusste, ob sie je wieder zurück kam, als sie wegging
Und als sie nicht mehr bei ihm war, war's hart und ihm ging's dreckig
Doch er ging ihr nach mit nur 'ner Hand voll Kleingeld in der Baggy
Sie ham geschworen sie gehn durch dick und dünn
Sie ham geschworen sie wären durch nichts zu trennen
Sie wären verloren, wenn sie sich nicht mehr kennen
Vielleicht war's Schicksal und es durfte nicht sein
Doch plötzlich war's als schien der Mond im dunkeln nur für die zwei
Keiner hätt's geglaubt, doch wenn man kämpft und es versucht
Wird der allergrößte Traum wahr und am Ende alles gut
Und die Zwei hofften so lang jetzt war endlich alles cool
Und sie wurd schwanger mit dem Baby und ihr Baby, das bist du

Kleiner wisch die Tränen weg. Dein Daddy ist hier
Auch, wenn wir uns nicht sehen bin ich ständig bei dir
Im Herz und ich bin da für dich, egal was passiert
Bis an den Tag, wo ich im Grab liegt und mein Atem gefriert
Komm schon. Kleiner wisch die Tränen weg. Dein Daddy ist hier
Du brauchst nicht weinen. Ich hab 'n Platz reserviert
Im Herz und, wenn du einsam bist hör hin, wie es schlägt
Und du wirst spüren, dass ich bei dir bin. Was auch immer geschieht

Ich hab dich in meinem Herz bin ich auch noch so weit entfernt
Du bist mein strahlender Stern, im Herz
Ich hab dich in meinem Herz bin ich auch noch so weit entfernt
Du bist mein strahlender Stern, im Herz
Hohoh

Es trifft dich und schmerzt, bricht mir mein Herz
Selbst, wenn wochenlang die Sonne scheint fühl ich mich wie im Herbst
Seit du nicht mehr bei mir bist ist nichts so, wie es war
Und so, wie es ist gibt's nichts, was ich noch ohne dich hab
Ich schwörs. Ich denk an dich und tätowier mir deinen Namen aufs Herz
Und denk dran. Ich bin weiterhin für dich da
Du hörst, wie Mami weint und schreit: ""Ruf uns wieder an!""
Und ich weiß nicht, ob dus mir je verzeihst, doch ich tu, was ich kann
Und es tut mir Leid, dass ich nicht täglich mit der Fußball spielen kann
Und es tut weh, wenn ich dich nicht mit Mom zur Schule bringen kann, Kleiner
Du kannst nix dafür, doch hast es gespürt
Wie aus Liebe plötzlich Hass wird und der Hass uns zerstört
Doch glaub mir alles, was ich sag ist echt, wenn ich dir was rhyme
Schreib ich, bis ich vorm Blatt einschlaf, mit Tränen, die ich wein
Doch es ändert nichts dran, nein. Dein Daddy kommt nicht heim
Doch, wenn du leise bist und hinhörst sagt dein Herz dir diese Zeilen

Kleiner wisch die Tränen weg. Dein Daddy ist hier
Auch, wenn wir uns nicht sehen bin ich ständig bei dir
Im Herz und ich bin da für dich, egal was passiert
Bis an den Tag, wo ich im Grab liegt und mein Atem gefriert

And I barely ever sleep

Franky Perez,"The first time we met
I lit a cigarette
In a dive bar in downtown TJ
I ordered two shots
Dropped a dime in the jukebox
And played 3Life By The Drop2 by Stevie Ray

She was eighteen years old
Young and out of control
A Catholic school girl with ruby red lips
With that she pulled me close
Said Baby let's toast to meeting you in a place like this
Oh Bella Maria
Was raised in East L.A.
My Spanish rose from Mexico
Who stole my heart in TJ

The years have gone by
But from time to time
I still think of that night we shared
The last I heard she'd married divorced
Livin' not too far from here
Then one day in the Cuban café
I spotted those ruby red lips
She said I'll be your waitress today
What's the chances of me
Seeing you in a place like this

Oh Bella Maria
Was raised in East L.A.
My Spanish rose from Mexico
Who stole my heart in TJ

In a rundown church
Out on the edge of town
Maria was dressed in white
She had flowers in her hair
The congregation stared as an angel walked down the aisle
Right there in God's house we exchanged our vows
And sealed the deal with a kiss
With that I pulled her close
Said, who would have know 
We'd be meeting in a place like this

Say she don't need ya
And asks for a ride to the liquor store
She kills the bottle
Gives praise to Jesus
Then passes out on your living room floor

She tells the story of a shotgun wedding 
And a birth of a stillborn child
She was only 13 and her little body wasn't ready
Babies watching babies die

That is the most beautiful

That the doll has lost her head

Relax, my little fairy queen

She did tremble like an aspen leaf

""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my baby has gone from me.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Ran in the water, heart full of fear,
There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.

""You took your baby from me away.""
My heart cried out, ""She's mine to keep.""

What a word for mine
Daytime is a tragedy
But now it smells like victory

Who does she think she is?
What a singer, what a dancer
What a sinner

All is now, no maybe
No one's left untouched

Looking for water and there's sweat everywhere
Know that I'm nearer I smell damp air
I ain't tasted coffee for days

When the leaves are down I'll be southward bound
Hunters hunt the outsider.
When the wind grows cold, when the sun grows old,
Nothing holds the outsider

Just killed a man in a town called Nightfall
Damned if I can't remember it all
My hand it was shaking but his talk it was tall
I paid for the funeral crew
And it seems like I never reach Mexico
They're heading me off every place that I go
I'm sick of the fact that I've got to lay low
What else can an outsider do

I know they're near to me, I don't have to see
Just let me be the outsider
They ain't far behind, they're always on my mind
They won't find the outsider

And the Kunst won't talk to you
Because you kissed St Rollox Adieu
Because you robbed a supermarket or two
Well, who gives a damn about the prophets of Tesco?

Did I see you in a limousine
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened
Turn the rich into wine
Walk on the mean
For the fallen walk among us
Walk among us
Never judge us
Yeah we're all

Up now and get 'em, boy
Up now and get 'em, boy
Drink to the devil and death at the doctors

Did I see you in a limousine
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened
Five thousand users fed today
As you feed us
Won't you lead us
To be blessed

So we stole and drank Champagne
On the seventh seal you said you never feel pain
""I never feel pain, won't you hit me again?""
""I need a bit of black and blue to be a rotation""

In my blood I feel the bubbles burst
There was a flash of fist, an eyebrow burst
You've a lazy laugh and a red white shirt
I fell to the floor fainting at the sight of blood

Did I see you in a limousine
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened
Turn the rich into wine
Walk on the mean
Be they Magdalene or virgin you've already been
You've already been and we've already seen
That the fallen are the virtuous among us
Walk among us
Never judge us to be blessed

So I'm sorry if I ever resisted
I never had a doubt you ever existed
I only have a problem when people insist on
Taking their hate and placing it on your name

Some say you're trouble, boy
Just because you like to destroy
You are the word, the word is 'destroy'
I break this bottle and think of you fondly

Did I see you in a limousine
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened
To the whore in a hostel
Or the scum of a scheme
Turn the rich into wine
Walk on the mean

It's a nail in the beam
On this barren Earth

Or feel the sweet air spoken upon you

Of hope will reassure
Show me the future

Will see us joined together
If the oceans fled or the mountains sigh
Then I will keep on dreaming

I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again

Don't be afraid if you're descending the deepest despair
Without a handrail to guide you
Sometimes the sound of a thousand whispering words
Can confuse

But when you're sleeping
They shift and slide together
Bring meaning to the canyon's cry

Oh, I...I keep on dreaming

I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again
I live to dream again

Sometimes the sound of a thousand whispers
Are where you live a little fear
But feel the future

Well I feel us dream together
I feel no fear, I feel no fire

A home for the morning
And are you holding
Holding on so tight
You say that's what you have been given
A whole lot of nothing for your time
And have you sunken
Down in your bones
Do you toss and turn and turn at night
And are you holding, holding on so tight
Do you toss and turn and turn at night
And are holding, holding on so tight",September Fields

I ain't mean to be late, it was my night to watch my little girl.
It's chilly out here.
What happened, you crying?
Y'all got into it again, huh?
See you gotta let em know, from the jump, I don't care who they are, or who they with.
Yeah, I know they know we talking.
Why don't they just leave us alone?
I know it's hard for them to understand people like us can love each other.
Come on, stop cryin' now.
Oh, there's something I gotta tell you, I heard they watching you, yeah they watching you.
They watching me too.
But there ain't no reason to get low, I'm proud, I'm here.
You know, I'ma stand up for you, no matter what; and I know you'll stand up for me.
I don't have no doubt about you being true to me.
The world is ours, but right now i feel like the whole world is against us.

Seu medo te leva pra lugar nenhum

Mais do que a luz do amanhecer, esse amor
Vento que sopra a favor
Varrendo todos os pecados desse amor

Fred & Gustavo,"Eu não quero mais o seu carinho
Quero um tempo pra ficar sozinho
Quantas vezes te falei que você ia me perder
Nosso amor foi uma tempestade
Eu não aguento sua falsidade
Virar a cara pra verdade e fingir que nada aconteceu

Vê se lembra quantas vezes te pedi pra perdoar
E quantas vezes perdoei por te amar
Era tão fácil esquecer o que passou

Mas que pena, já não dá pra machucar meu coração
Que apesar de ser tão forte disse não
Achou melhor tomar coragem pra dizer

Agora quem não quer sou eu
Não adianta nem vir com charminho
Eu não caio nesse seu joguinho
Seu beijo não merece o meu

Vai dar valor no que é seu",Quem Nao Quer Sou Eu
Fred & Gustavo,"Foram os melhores dias da minha vida
Você e eu éramos como letra e melodia
Da mais linda canção de amor
Mas um dia, quando eu voltei pra casa
Você já não estava mais ali

Quando você foi embora
Eu não via a hora de te ver voltar
Trazendo a alegria que existia um dia aqui nesse lugar
Que apesar de abandonado
Tudo aqui é seu e pra sempre será
Coração 'tá esperando só você voltar

Só quem conhece a saudade
Sabe o gosto amargo que a solidão
Deixa lá dentro do peito destruindo os sonhos, planos e paixão
As lembranças me atormentam,
Minha própria mente insiste em me trair
Revivendo os bons momentos
Tudo é mais difícil sem você aqui",Sem Voce Aqui
Fred & Gustavo,"Se liga aí
Vai começar o movimento

Tell me you agree,

Dearly beloved, how clearly I see,
Somewhere in Heaven you were fashioned for me,
Angel eyes knew you,
Angel voices led me to you

Fate gave me a sign
I know that I'll be yours come shower or shine
So I say merely,
Dearly beloved be mine.

Fred Astaire,"When shades enfold
The sunset's gold
And stars are bright above again
I smile, sweetheart
For then I know I can start
To live again, to love again

When day is done
And night comes on
Until the dawn
What do I do
I clasp your hand
And wander through slumberland
Dream-dancing with you

We dance between
A sky serene
And fields of green
Sparkling with dew
It's joy sublime
Whenever I spend my time

Fred Astaire,"I am not such a clever one about the latest fads
I admit I was never one adored by local lads
Not that I ever tried to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint

I'm old fashioned, I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain upon a window pane

This years fancies are passing fancies
But sighing sighs, holding hands
These my heart understands

That's how I want to be

We're drinking my friend, to the end
Of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

I got the routine, so drop another nickel
In the machine
I'm feeling so bad, I wish you'd make the music
Dreamy and sad

Could tell you a lot, but that's not
In a gentleman's code

And one more for the road

And I've got a lot of things to say
And when I'm gloomy, you simply gotta listen to me
Until it's all talked away

Well that's how it goes, and Joe I know your gettin'

Fred Astaire,"Just heard of the Shorty George
Got word of the Shorty George
Seems that it's a kind of jig  
Named for someone about so big

He rambles around the town
Preambles around the town
Then stops on a crowded street 
'n beats his feet till his feet is beat

Watch him go! - and he can - 
Like a real- nach'-l man
High Stepper is Shorty George
Black pepper is Shorty George

He dances to pay the rent
And to see that you're solid sent
Mister can you spare a penny?
Lady can you spare a dime? 

He makes, I don't know how many
'Cause he's dancin' all the time. 
Popa's dressed up mighty sporty
Momma's snooz-in' in the shade

But while mommas's catchin' ""forty""
Shorty sees the rent is paid
Get hip to the Shorty George
Hop, skip to the ""Shorty George""

Directions are short and sweet
Beat your feet till your feet is beat
So catch-on to ""Shorty George"" 
And latch onto ""Shorty George""

Good people I'm tellin' you
""Shorty George"" is the dance to do.",The Shorty George
Fred Astaire,"Maybe it was the music
Or the glamorous sky of blue
Maybe it was the mood I was in
Or maybe it was really you, really you

This heart of mine was doing very well
The world was fine as far as i could tell
And then quite suddenly i saw you, and i dreamed of gay amours
At dawn i wake up singing sentimental overtures

This heart of mine is gaily dancing now
I taste the wine of real romancing now
Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design
As long as life endures, it's yours, this heart of mine",This Heart of Mine
Fred Astaire,"I was never able to recite a fable
That would make the party bright;
Sitting at the table I was never able
To become the host's delight
But now you've given me my after dinner story,
I'll just describe you as you are in all your glory.

[Chorus]
You were never lovelier,
You were never so fair,
Dreams were never lovelier,
Pardon me if I stare.

Down the sky the moonbeams fly to light your face;
I can only say they chose the proper place.
You were never lovelier,
And to coin a new phrase;
I was never luckier in my palmiest days.
Make a note, and you can quote me,
Honor bright,
You were never lovelier than you are tonight.

[Chorus]",You Were Never Lovelier
Fred Astaire,"I could dance nightly
Just holding you tightly
My sweet
I could keep right on
Because you're so light on
Your feet
You're easy to dance with

There is no doubt in
The way we stand out in
The crowd
Though it's called dancing
To me it's romancing
Out loud
You're easy to dance with

Loving you
The way I do
Makes you easy to dance with
That is why I'm always right on the beat
All those charms
In one man's arms
Makes you easy to dance with

Fred Astaire,"I was blue, just as blue as I could be
Ev'ry day was a cloudy day for me
Then good luck came a-knocking at my door
Skies were gray but they're not gray anymore

Blue skies
Smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies
Do I see

Bluebirds
Singing a song
Nothing but bluebirds
All day long

Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly

Blue days
All of them gone
Nothing but blue skies
From now on

Fred Astaire,"Say, have you seen a Carioca?
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the Polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye
Goodbye",The Carioca
Fred Astaire,"Heaven, I'm in heaven 
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek

Heaven, I'm in heaven 
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek

Oh! I love to climb a mountain 
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh! I love to go out fishing 
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through to heaven

And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak 
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek",Cheek to Cheek
Fred Astaire,"Beautiful music
Dangerous rhythm
It's something daring, The Continental,
A way of dancing that's really 'entre nous'.

It's very subtle, The Continental,
Because it does what you want it to do.
It has a passion, The Continental,
An invitation to moonlight and romance.

It's quite the fashion, The Continental,
Because you tell of your love while you dance.
Your lips whisper so tenderly.
Her eyes answer your song.

Two bodies swaying, The Continental,
And you are saying just what you're dreaming of.
So keep on dancing, The Continental,
For it's a song of romance and of love.

You kiss while you're dancing.
Not a bad idea. 
The Continental, hmmmmm. It's continental.
You sing while you're dancing.

Your voice is gentle and sentimental.
You stroll together arm in arm.
You nonchalantly glide along with grace and charm.
You will find while you're dancing

That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul,
A certain rhythm that you can't control,
And you will do 
The Continental all the time.",The Continental

That pit-a-pats through my brain; 
So darn persistent, 
The day isn't distant 

When it'll drive me insane. 
Comes in the morning 
Without any warning, 
And hangs around me all day. 

I'll have to sneak up to it 
Someday, and speak up to it.

Never stopping

I know that 
Once it didn't matter 
But now you're doing wrong; 
When you start to patter 

I'm so unhappy. 
Won't you take a day off?

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You

Up on the top of a snow-covered mountain
There lived an Alpine miss
And oh, what a sweet little miss was this
We mean this little Swiss miss

While down in the valley below (Ho-ho)
Lived a boy who loved her so (Ho-ho)
He loved her with all his might
He loved her day and night

And every night just to see this miss
He used to risk his scalp
For the house where she lived was away up high
And the poor guy didn't know how to fly
So he jumped from alp to alp
What a chump (What a chump)
To jump (To jump)
From alp to alp

And then beneath her balcony
He used to stand around and try to make a hit with her
And he would yodel, ""O-lay-eee-tee""
That's the Swiss idea of a melody
And oh, what a yodeling fool was he
He shook a wicked yodel

And one night as he stood there
The lights were very dim
While leaning out too far across her balcony
She fell for him
He sat with his arms around her
Until the night was gone
And here's the way they carried on

He said, ""Dear I think you're just as sweet as you can be
You're like a cake of sweet Swiss chocolate to me""
She said, ""Oh, my loving one, your talk I can't resist
I hope you're as steady as the Swiss watch ticking on your wrist""
He said, ""How I yearn for you, I burn for you, I do! I do!

With a happy-go-lucky beat
You'll find a lot in what I'm repeating
When there's a shine on your shoes
There's a melody in your heart
What a wonderful way to start the day!

Now there's a shine that you get in the barber shop
There's a shine that you get in the Pullman car
There's a shine that you get in the pool room
There's a shine that you get in the school room

But it doesn't matter where you get it
It'll do a lot of good if you let it
A little bit of polish will abolish what's bothering you

When there's a shine on your shoes
Melody in your heart
Singable happy feeling
Wonderful!

Fred Astaire,"By the Adriatic waters Venetian sons and daughters
Are strumming a new tune upon their guitars.
It was written by a Latin, a gondolier who sat in
His home out in Brooklyn and gazed at the stars.

He sent his melody across the sea to Italy,
And we know they wrote some words to fit that catchy bit
And christened it the Piccolino.

And we know that it's the reason why
Everyone this season is strumming and humming a new melody.

Come to the Casino and hear them play the Piccolino.
Dance with your bambino to the strains of the catchy Piccolino.
Drink your glass of Vino, and when you've had your plate of Scallopino,
Make them play the Piccolino, the catchy Piccolino.
And dance to the strains of that new melody, the Piccolino.",The Piccolino

That I'm feeling far from gay,

Makes me all the plainer see
How inane, how vain, how empty life without you would be.

Could supply my sky of blue?
After you, who
Could I love?
After you, why
Should I take the time to try,
For who else could qualify
After you, who?

Fred Astaire,"Once upon a midnight dreary
While I pondered weak and weary
From a long trip on the Erie
Comes a rappin' on my chamber door

It's an ectoplasmic tapping
That disturbs my nightly napping
Like a shroud that's gently flapping
Emanating from the second floor

Buddies are we, me and the ghost upstairs
Sipping our tea, me and the ghost upstairs
But he's inclined to moan when left alone
So I think of things that'll tickle his funny bone

Lonely old ghost upstairs

Regular folks, droppin' our worldly cares
Swappin' our jokes, me and the ghost upstairs
And then he slaps his shroud and laughs out loud
And says ""Oh boy, that'll paralyze all the crowd""

Jolly old ghost upstairs

He's quite a cook, he serves a beautiful drink
He wrote a book and in invisible ink
I took a look and the title 'pon the page
Was 'The Groups of Wraith'

Once in a while he brings a gang of friends
Does it in style, careless of what he spends
And though the place is small we have a ball
'Cause you know those spooks don't require no room at all

Fred Astaire,"I left my hat in Haiti
In some forgotten flat in Haiti
I couldn't tell you how I got there
I only know it was so hot there

She took my hat politely
And wound her arms around me tightly
But I remember nothing clearly
Except the flame when she came near me

Her eyes had the glow of surrender
And her touch it was tender
And with someone as fiery as that
You forget about your hat

So if you go to Haiti
There is a girl I know in Haiti
If you can find her you'll adore her
Just look around till you've found someone who has a blue-grey fedora

You're Moonlight on a night in Capri,
And Cape Cod looking out at the sea,
You're all places that leave me breathless,
And no wonder: you're all the world to me.

You're Sun Valley right after a snow.

My eyes adored you like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far
Carried your books from school
Playin' make believe you're married to me
You were fifth grade, I was sixth when we came to be
Walkin' home ev'ry day over Bonnicut Bridge and Bay
Till we grew into the me and you who went our separate ways

My eyes adored you though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far
Headed for city lights, climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to the bone made myself a name
Funny I seemed to find that no matter how the years unwind
Still I reminisce 'bout the girl I miss and the love I left behind

My eyes adored you though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you

Listen to me crying on my pillow
Crying cause I know my love is gone from me

Looking at a million different faces
Yet I see a face in every face I see      
Love must lack a sense of humor, 

It laughs when other people cry
Love, would love to hear the rumor, 
That you and I have finally said goodbye

I know that every heart was made for breaking
And my love was ready for the takin',
Still I won't complain for someday love will call again

Must I take a memory as a token,
To replace a heart that love has broken
Will the wailing willow always weep for me
Must I see a face in every place I see

I admit I was never one adored by local lads
Not that I ever tried to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint

I'm old fashioned, I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This years fancies are passing fancies
But sighing sighs, holding hands
These my heart understands

I'm old fashioned but I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me.

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

The only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl-and-boy-ment

B-B-B-Baby
Come on girls
You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby

Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby

All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows 
If the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
There's a sign on the wall 
But she wants to be sure

In a tree by the brook 
There's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn 
For those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, 
Don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by 
But in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 
And it makes me wonder. 
Your head is humming and it won't go 
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last.

Escono i cuori spezzati

Sembra che mi riconosca

Cade la linea, lo tiro via
E ho trovato un reggiseno tuo in tintoria
E mi chiedo cosa da te mi ha spinto via
Chiedi perché rido
Ti rende irascibile la mia ironia
Di te mi resta solo questa melodia
E la sento sempre meno mia

Ho ritrovato il mio cuore nello sterno
Il mio cuore è un organo scordato e mi ero scordato di averlo
Ti giuro che ad amarti ci provo
Anche se tu non riesci più a fidarti di un uomo
Quanto pesa sapere che vali
Ma non puoi separare i carati dall'oro
Ci svegliamo piangendo, sudati
Come fossimo nati di nuovo
Ora stiamo qui a guardare il sole
Aspettando che bruci il mondo
E da te io più vorrei allontanarmi e più ci torno
Ora siamo confusi
Giriamo al buio senza luce intorno
La nostra storia ormai è un tunnel senza luce in fondo
Diventiamo qualcuno per apparire
Cresciamo ad appassionarci
Invecchiamo per appassire
E tu mi guardi come un pazzo lunatico

Non sono io, Dio ho marcato troppo sul mio tratto somatico

Perdonami se insisto
Ricordami che esisto

Vedo il buio più scuro
Siamo così avanti che per noi è già futuro

Vedo te che ti allontani dalla ferrovia

Non sono bravo a soffrire, lo vedi che soffro male?
Non riesco neanche a mangiare, ho paura di soffocare
Mi chiedo un uomo quanto ancora può sopportare?
Il problema è che quel che voglio non lo posso toccare
Ma appena lei mi vuole corro
Sono sempre sveglio e non so mai che ore sono
Penso solo a risolvere gli errori come Norton
Ho paura a guardarmi dentro, baby c'ho un cuore d'horror
E adesso che peso le parole cadono a goccie
E tu tieni le mani sotto a forma di coca
Così non ne perdi nemmeno un sorso
Lego un ago al filo del discorso così quando parlo ti cucio la bocca

A ripensare a te non ti ho mai vista ridere
A parte che con quelle quattro vipere
Che tradiscono per sentirsi libere
Hanno studiato lingue per mentire a più gente possibile

Perdonami se insisto
Ricordami che esisto
Vedo il buio più scuro
Siamo così avanti che per noi è già futuro

Vedo te che ti allontani dalla ferrovia
Siamo passati dal buongiorno al buenos dias
Ti chiamo al telefono
Cade la linea, lo tiro via
E ho trovato un reggiseno tuo in tintoria
E mi chiedo cosa da te mi ha spinto via
Chiedi perché rido
Ti rende irrascibile la mia ironia
Di te mi resta solo questa melodia
E la sento sempre meno mia
Baby, buenos dias, oh
Baby, buenos dias, oh",Buenos Dias
Fred Dupin and New Bumpers Jazz Band,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?
Fred Eaglesmith,"Trains don't cry and bullets don't sing.
A broken heart 	ain't worth anything.
Even a bird of prey lets out some sort of scream.
I would have never done to you what you done to me.

Fifty odd dollars, some dry alcohol
Stand on the stairway, against the wall.
Even a preacher, Lord, sometimes he just can't believe.
I would have never done to you what you done to me.

(Instrumental verse)

Lies on your table, lies in your eyes.
Lies in your face, lies in your smile.
Trains only leave and bullets just scream.
I would have never done to you what you done to me.

Fred Elizalde,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

How long has this, been going on?",How Long Has This Been Going On?

Trusting in someone who?s made of flesh and blood
Such a frightful situation
Continual emotional intensive care
Is from too high expectations
So like a flower depends on rainfall
And like true lovers depend on phone calls
Like a song needs a tune
My heart depends on you (My heart depends on you)
Ooo oo oooo ooooo

Some folks build their life only on wealth and fame
Or if they get high place employment
Not knowing they?re building hopes and dreams on sand
They soon are disappointed (disappointed)
So like a good day (good day) depends on sunshine (on sunshine)
And like the harvest depends on the time
Like the tide needs the moon
My heart depends on you (My heart depends on you)
Ooo oo oooo ooooo

On Your Holy Word I am standing
For every word is true
That?s why I?m trusting in You
Like a comedian needs to be funny
And like a banker depends on money
Like a bride needs a groom
My heart depends on you (My heart depends on you)
Ooo oo oooo ooooo

On Your Holy Word I am standing
For every word is true
That?s why I?m trusting in You

Breathe into me oh Lord, day by day

Couldn't pay the price to save my life
But You took the cost, and found what was lost

Call me righteous, since He changed my nature
Call me righteous, changed my name
Call me righteous, I'm a brand new creature
Call me righteous, I'm not the same

I can't believe it, He knew all bout me
Still He loved me enough to forgive me
I never thought my name would be royal
Since He gave I will give Him all

To make You call me one of Your sons
Couldn't pay the price to save my life

Fred Hammond,"Let it go on and on, and on, and on, and on
Never go away

Gotta be something about this time of year
That makes everybody act just a little more sincere
There's nothing like stepping outside
To exchange a neighbor's smile
Or just shaking hands a little longer, maybe talk a while

Lugging shopping bags down the street
Making time to speak to everybody that you meet
Making the cruise through the old neighborhood
Just taking in who's decorated and it's all good

I wish that Christmas would be everyday
Let it go on and on, and on, and on, and on
Why does this feeling have to go away?
If it were up to me, the season would never change
It would always stay the same

I had to stop over my mom's crib the other day
'Cause she's getting older now, gotta make sure she's okay
A smile and a hug would do her heart some good
Just chilling with family on Christmas like a family should

I am grateful for all that God has given me
I'm compelled to go help somebody else in need
Come back home and in for the night
Telling the kids the season's really all about Christ

I wish that Christmas would be everyday
Let it go on and on, and on, and on, and on
Why does this feeling have to go away?
If it were up to me, the season would never change
It would always stay the same, the same, the same

Why can't we show each other the same love?
The same, the same good love, real love
To me, once a year is really not enough

I wish that Christmas would be everyday
Let it go on and on, and on, and on, and on
Why does this feeling have to go away?
If it were up to me, the season would never change
It would always stay the same

I wish that Christmas would be everyday

Fred Hammond,"All the angels held their breath
As Heaven put on human clothes
Rang the news God did not forget
His promise that was sent from the prophets old

The answer came in a sacred birth
Truth and justice, meek and mild
All the hope and the peace on earth
Rested in the hands of a newborn child

From God in the highest
Heaven made a way in a manger
From God in the highest
Love was born through a simple virgin girl
Took a child to save the world

For the ones who were lost He came
Every child of Adam's fall
Emmanuel was the precious name
Of the small boy who would grow
And would touch us all

From God in the highest
Heaven made a way in a manger

Love was born through a simple virgin girl
A child to save the world

So let the kings and the nations bow
To the baby so divine

Love was born through a simple virgin girl
Took a child to save the world

From God in the highest

Love was born through a simple virgin girl
Took a child to save the world

For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
Took a child to save the world

For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
He came to seek the lost like you and I

He came to seek and save
Redeem us back to Him

If you will believe in Him eternal life you'll find

And I don't know what to do
While I'm in this change, help me remain
I will count on You, oh, oh

When I can't see, I know You'll guide
When I cry out, I know You feel
Now I'm praying, I know You hear
I'm praying for healing, I know You will

Who do you call when no one has the answer?
Where do you go when the place you've know is no more?
When will they stop? All the tears they just keep falling
Pain doesn't care where you live or who you are

My life is broken
And I don't know what to do
While I'm in this change, help me remain
I will count on You, oh, oh

When I cry out, I know You feel
Now I'm praying, I know You hear
Praying for healing, I know You will

We ask you to forgive
And we will do the same
We receive Your love
Lord we'll take time to heal

Hold on and wait just a little while
He'll bring a song of strength in the midnight
Touch our lives with Your loving hand
Hold on, we'll hold on, hold on, hold on

Hold on and wait just a little while
He'll bring a song of strength in the midnight
Touch our lives with Your loving hand

Three boys risked their lives
In flames of fire they were sure to die
The king said bow they said we're not gonna do it
Although they went it, the Lord He brought it

(Channel)
He knows the path You take and even if it leads you to a rocky place
It's okay
Whatever you can think to ask, He can do much more
And you just say while you wait

(Chorus)
Is there anything, anything
Anything too hard for Him
If it's impossible, do you need a miracle
Anything too hard for Him

(Verse 2)
Say you got a mountain
Seems like it won't move
No time to climb it it
You don't know what to do, hey
What about when
(HE BROUGHT A(or the) BIG GIANT DOWN.)
With a stone in the hands of a little child

(Repeat Channel 2x)
(Verse 3 or maybe 2)
All around Jesus, was a multitude.
Somebody said, ""how we gonna feed 'em, ain't got no food?""
And then a little boy, with fish and bread, that ain't nothin',
The disciples said.
But look at Jesus, he made a way.
More than 5,000 ate good that day.

Ever have God, come talk to you?
Say you're gonna have baby,
When you should be through.
Abraham told Sarah 'bout the promise child.
You know she laughed said man that sounds wild.
But God through her, blew everybody's mind.
And here comes Isaac, right on time, say.

Let's face the facts, hey yeah
With their spirits hopeless, bruised and broken
So much we lack
More defeated words have not been spoken
Out of twelve who stood to speak their mind
The report was filed by ten
But the last two stood with quite a different spin
They said I don't agree with those who say
In our own eyes we are small
For we serve a true and living God
And He is the Lord of all

And if He said the land is ours then we
Should move ahead with no delay

When asked to give
A true assessment for the task before you
Stop and re-live
The many ways His mighty arms has brought you through
Remember every lion's den
And don't forget your last red sea
Know with God there's endless possibilities
So let us see ourselves as those can
Even if we can't see how
Let us see and dream, possess and build
Even if giants live there now

Should move ahead with no delay

And believe with my heart
Until the end

Come on somebody, right here, right now
We come to give Your name to glory
Somebody help me
Sisters tell me something, come on

Looked around the week was gone
Worked my fingers to the bone, I should've known
That the struggle I had faced wasn't over
Drama won't leave me alone

When the world all around me gives me every reason to faint
My first and the last real defense is to stand and to say

No matter what is going on
My God still sits upon the throne
I might get down but not for long
My praise will keep me moving on

Join in together like this, like this come on
Sister tell me something else

Turned around I'd made it through
Wasn't sure of how I would but the Lord you knew
That my strength would surely fade but You'd cover
And my joy You would renew

You know the enemy seeks and he roars with his plans to abuse
In the midst of his rage and his lies let us stand on the truth

No matter what is going on
My God still sits upon the throne
I might get down but not for long
My praise will keep me moving on

No matter what the circumstance
I know my life is in His hands
The storms may come but not for long
My praise will keep me moving on

Now if I'm really honest I really gotta say
That I get somewhat discouraged when trials come my way
But this will be my choice, will be my choice

No matter what the day may bring to you
Keep praising God
Whether up or down, whether good or bad
Keep your praise always

No matter what the day may bring to you
Keep praising God
Whether this or that, just don't hold back
Keep your praise flowing

Keep on, keep praisin'

No matter what the day may bring to you
Keep praisin' God
Whether this or that, just don't hold back
Keep your faith strong and

Keep on, keep praisin'
Keep on, keep praisin'

So for my sin He did atone
He purchased me I'm not my own
I wanna please Him

So now I serve Him
Who brought me and is able to keep me all together

That for my life His good and perfect purpose was designed

Gotta be gotta be destiny

Not called to sit upon the shelf
He did not die just for His health
And with the time we have
Let's waste not all on selfish reasons
But we must seek to please Him first
Find His will upon the Earth
When they look back from death to birth
They'll say they've seen Him

So we must serve Him
Who brought us and is able to keep us all together

So keepin' the faith is what we've gotta do
To believe our God is more than able, able

That we obtain His favor

This time is sanctified
We drink of the rain and eat the bread
For our iniquities his body was bruised
And for our peace his blood was shed

But we gather not in sorrow
To commemorate ah

That he died to bring us 
Back to the father

What you must realize
Its time to eat the bread
And drink against of 
The bonds was set
That you agree with every word
That's in this eat
And that you embrace the masters hand

But its only to remind you
The law has been fulfilled (ah)
A new covenant abides
And that held is broken
We're trapped no longer inside

So eat the bread
And drink the wine
So we can have
Sweet Communion
He gave his life
Once for all time
So we can have
Sweet Communion

So eat the bread
And drink the wine
So we can have
Sweet Communion
He gave his life
Once for all time
So we can have
Sweet Communion

For I received from the Lord 
What I also pass unto you
The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed
Took bread, and when he had given thanks
He broke it and said,

""This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me."" 
In the same way after supper, he took the cup, saying
""This cup is the new covenant in my blood
Do this whenever you drink in remembrance of me
For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup
You proclaim the Lord's dad until he comes.",Communion Song

This love isn't like anything that you've ever known
He has a better love, better love
I know you've probably heard it before
When someone can give you love, affection and more
But this love I offer you will come through for sure
He has a better love, better love

I have been there
Feeling that theres no one to care
Believing that life is so unfair
Thinking they'll never be
Someone thats good to me
So please believe
Open up your heart and receive
I said this love covers complete
His love is for everyone
No matter what you've done

There is a love
A love that looks beyond my faults
A love so true
The only love thats meant for you

[Chorus: x2]

[Repeat: x3]
I've tried him and I know it
I've tried him and I know it
I've tried him, I know it

He won't let you down
Always be around
When your friends walk out
He will be there for you

[Repeat: x3]
I've tried him and I know it
I've tried him and I know it
I've tried him, I know it",Better Love

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.

At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Visions of the things to be
The pains that are withheld for me
I realize and I can see

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card of some delay
So this is all I have to say

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skin
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works it's way on in
The pain grows stronger, watch it burn

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied, ""Oh why ask me?""

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I

That suicide is painless

Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

And through foggy London town,
